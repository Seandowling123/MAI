Jun 01, 2018( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Chaos ensued 
at the Dublin Airport, Ireland, after a public address systemin the facility malfunctioned, making it stuck on the 
evacuation mode when there was no actual emergency in the airport. 'There is a fault with our PA system at our 
Pier 1 gates @DublinAirport. 
The system is stuck on evacuation mode. There is NO evacuation of this area. Our sound engineers are currently 
investigating,' the airport clarified via a tweet on social media. Evacuation alarms started to go off around 6:30 a.m. 
local time (1:30 a.m. EDT) in Terminal One of the airport, resulting in hundreds of confused passengers making 
their way out of the airport. A number of travelers also took to social media to express their frustration at the lack of 
information regarding the evacuation from the airport officials. "Alarms going off in Dublin Airport saying to 
evacuate. Nobody moving, not even staff look bothered. Nice if someone announced what's happening,' Twitter 
user Neill Hill who was present at the facility at the time of the incident wrote, while another user tweeted, 
'Evacuation in Dublin Airport T1 complete chaos." Yet another Twitter user posted a video of the chaotic situation at 
the terminal. A crowd of uncertain passengers are seen standing at the airport, not sure whether to evacuate or 
not.Last year, the Dublin Airport was evacuated after fire broke out in one of the offices inside the facility. The 
evacuation orders were part of a safety measure as the fire crews tackled the blaze. In a statement to 
Independent[1] at the time, the airport said: "The Pier 3 boarding gate facility was temporarily evacuated at about 
9.30 a.m. (local time, 4:30 a.m. EDT) this morning due to small fire in an office which is separate from the public 
areas of the pier. The fire was quickly extinguished and no one injured. As a precautionary measure, security 
screening was suspended for about 12 minutes in Terminal 1.' Chaos ensued at the Dublin Airport, Ireland, after 
public announcement in the facility malfunctioned, making it stuck on the evacuation mode when there was no 
actual emergency in the airport. In this photo, a man waits for a delayed Ryanair flight to arrive in the departures

European carriers more financially vulnerable than US carriers: Morgan Stanley
European carriers more financially vulnerable than US carriers: Morgan 
Stanley

The higher variance in operating margins and increased susceptibility towards foreign exchange and labour inflation 
pressures makes European carriers more financially vulnerable than US carriers in the current market, according to 
Morgan Stanley.
In an equity research report, the US bank says that while the US airlines typically carry lower levels of hedging than 
European peers, market concentration and margins are higher and foreign exchange plays less of a financial risk to 
financial statements than in Europe.
In 2017 the operating margins average for top-10 US airlines was approximately 14.8% (with a spread of 1,000 
basis pointsbetween high and low – a range of 10-20%), while for top 10 European airlines it is approximately9.6% 
(6.7% excluding Ryanair).
“The spread between high and low is significantly wider – 4,000 bps including Alitalia and 3,000 bps excluding 
Alitalia,” says the bank. “We therefore believe it will be more difficult for European carriers to withstand fuel, foreign 
exchange and labour inflation pressures as well as sustain investment in fleet with higher US dollar levels into 
2018-19. European airlines face mainly significant foreign exchange transactional and translational changes - on 
the costs front as well as on the revenue front along with change in Fuel price (which is also faced by US airlines).”
Morgan Stanley adds that cost and capex inflation pressures will take a meaningful toll on both growth potential and 
financial reserves at the weaker European airlines.
The US bank adds that although there are supportive trends for European low-cost carriers (LCCs), the European 
short-haul is different, as the financial health gaps are far greater than seen in the comparable US domestic market.
“We believe this means that cost pressures from fuel and foreign exchange and/or risks from macro, regulatory or 
political factors can result is substantial market changes both from capacity and supplier cost potentials (airport 
deals, aircraft & leasing opportunities) to the larger scale players.”

Lufthansa is in discussions with Norwegian Air Shuttle about a possible takeover of the airline, the German airline’s 
chief executive has told Sueddeutsche Zeitung, a German newspaper.
The German airline has now joined its rival International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways, Iberia, Aer 
Lingus and Vueling, in the race to acquire Norwegian.
“In Europe, everyone is talking to everyone. There’s a new wave of consolidation approaching. That means we are 
also in contact with Norwegian,” Carsten Spohr was quoted as saying by Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Monday (19 
June).
Asked whether Norwegian would fit the Lufthansa group, Spohr said: “Takeovers are always a question of strategic 
value, the price and anti-trust. There are no easy answers.”
In April, IAG bought a 4.61% equity stake in Norwegian so it could begin discussions to potentially acquire the 
whole airline.
In May the board of Norwegian Air Shuttle (NAS) confirmed that it had received two separate conditional proposals 
from IAG in relation to acquiring 100% of the airlines. Other airlines have reportedly shown an interest in acquiring 
the Norwegian low-cost carrier.
On 22 May, Spanish newspaper Expansion, citing industry sources, reported that IAG planned to make an offer of 
&euro;1.52 billion ($1.79 billion) for Norwegian Air Shuttle.
On 28 May, Ryanair denied making an approach to acquire a 20% stake in Norwegian. Reuters reported that the 
airline had made an approach to acquire an equity stake in the carrier last year.

Further consolidation is inevitable in the still-crowded European airline sector both as a result of bankruptcies and 
through M&A, with clear consolidators emerging, according to Fitch Ratings.
In a report, the rating agency says: “We expect five large airline groups to dominate the future of the sector, while 
medium and small carriers are likely to remain under pressure.”
It notes that the European airline sector remains fragmented, with over 100 airlines in operation despite recent 
consolidation. The top five carriers account for about 50% of intra-European seats compared with the domestic 
market share of almost 80% for the four largest US carriers.
“This highly competitive environment is further exacerbated by strong competition from low-cost and ultra-low-cost 
carriers, which provide over a third of seat capacity on short-haul in Europe. The sector therefore frequently faces 
defaults, including those of larger carriers like Air Berlin in Germany and Alitalia in Italy in the last couple of years.”
The agency adds that it expects consolidation in the European airline sector to continue through a combination of 
M&A and defaults, albeit slowly. It adds that the medium-term prospects of the European airline sector are likely to 
be shaped by five large groups: Lufthansa, IAG, Ryanair, Easyjet and Air France-KLM, provided the latter resolves 
its legacy issues sustainably.
“For many midsize and small airlines achieving sustained profitability is likely to require operational restructuring 
and joining an alliance or sale to a bigger company. Failure to achieve financial sustainability may lead to 
bankruptcy. The increase in oil prices this year may put further pressure on costs. Midsize and regional airlines do 
not have an extensive long-haul network or a cost base they can rely on while competing with LCCs on short and 
medium haul and with other network carriers on long haul, unlike their larger peers.”
The European airline sector will continue to face disruptions from development of the long-haul low-cost model, 
consolidation, intensified competition, Brexit, or even market openness to foreign carrier control in the long run, 
says Fitch.
“Therefore we expect companies with strong balance sheets and business profiles (eg BA, Lufthansa and Ryanair) 
to be well placed to cope with the rapidly changing landscape and disruptions.”
More European airline consolidation inevitable: Fitch
The rating agency downgraded Etihad Group’s “EA Partners I and II” BV's notes to 'CC' with several actions 
following the bankruptcy of Alitalia and Air Berlin. Fitch adds that negative rating actions on other rated airlines are 
possible due to underperformance but are not a prevailing trend.

A UK PILOT'S union has secured a meeting with Ryanair after threatening possible industrial action against the 
airline unless it implements a transparent system to manage promotions.
The British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) wrote a letter to the Irish carrier demanding that it agreed to a meeting 
discussing staffing issues or face strike action.
Balpa's national officer Terry Brandon said that the company's pilots "urgently want to negotiate an agreement on 
seniority" and that the union "would consider an industrial action ballot if Ryanair did not agree to talks".
Brandon said that Ryanair will now be meeting with the union next month.

The union representing Ryanair pilots in Britain, the airline's largest market, has threatened possible strike action 
unless the company implements a transparent system to manage promotions and transfers, according to a letter 
seen by Reuters.
Ryanair in December recognised trade unions for the first time in its 32-year history, but has since then struggled to 
reach agreement on the terms of the recognition with some unions and it faces several threats of strike action.
Industrial action in Britain, Ryanair's first market to agree a formal union recognition agreement, could be 
particularly damaging. The airline has experienced minor disruption due to industrial action in Germany and 
Portugal, but has so far avoided a major stoppage.
Ryanair's Irish union two weeks ago threatened possible strike action unless the airline agrees to new working 
practices.
In the letter to Chief Executive Michael O'Leary, dated May 24, the BALPA union demanded a seniority system to 
"provide transparency and fairness to decisions made by management which have a very large impact on the lives 
of our members and their families."
In particular, the union said it wanted transparent systems for involuntary base transfers, command upgrades and 
the allocation of annual leave and promotion.
"If it is not possible to immediately negotiate the introduction of such a Seniority Agreement, it is our intention to 
escalate this matter as a matter of urgency, to seek sanction for industrial action up to and including strike action 
should that be necessary," the letter said.

The letter requested a positive response to the letter "on or before" Tuesday, May 29.
A spokesman for Ryanair said the airline did not comment on negotiations with its staff. (Reuters)

June 30 to meet certain demands. They have also threatened industrial action during the busy summer period if it 
fails to do so.  Royal Bank of Scotland tumbled 3.4 percent. The U.K government is preparing to sell a multi-billion 
pound stake in the bank, resuming a huge privatization program that has been stalled for three years, Sky News

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Cabin crew unions from several European Union countries have given Ryanair Holdings 
plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) until June 30 to meet certain demands, and threatened industrial action during the busy 
summer period if it fails to do so, according to reports.  Spain's USO and Sitcpla, Portugal's Snpvac, Italy's UIL and 
Belgium's CNE held a meeting today in Madrid to demand Ryanair apply to workers the legislation of each of the 
countries it operates in, the reports said. Among other demands, the unions ask that Ryanair give all cabin crew the 
same working conditions, the reports said.

Huge lightning storms in UK disrupt travel at London airport

LONDON (AP) - British meteorologists said thousands of lightning strikes hit the U.K. during a powerful overnight 
thunderstorm, and a London-area airport reported flight disruptions Sunday after an aircraft refueling system was 
damaged.
London Stansted Airport said that a lightning strike disabled the fueling system "for a period this morning. Engineers 
have been on site and have now restored the system, however flights may still be subject to diversion, delay or 
cancellation."
More than 200 flights were delayed at Stansted. Another 31 departures and 18 arrivals were cancelled, according to 
FlightStats, which provides data on commercial aviation.
London-area airports were busier than usual, since Britain is in the middle of a long holiday weekend, and many 
schoolchildren also have a half-term break this coming week.
Budget airline Ryanair, which has a big presence at Stansted, couldn't say how many of its flights had been 
affected at the airport, but was offering full refunds to some.
The Ireland-based airline apologized to those affected, but said the disruptions were beyond the company's control.
"A number of flights have regrettably been cancelled at Stansted Airport this morning due to an earlier airport 
fueling system failure, caused by a lightning strike," a Ryanair spokesman said. "All affected customers are being 
contacted and advised of their options of a full refund, a free transfer on to the next available flight or a free transfer 
on to an alternative routing."
Meteorologist Charlie Powell said information suggested there were "somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 
strikes across the U.K. during the overnight period."

May 27, 2018( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  London 
Stansted Airport in the United Kingdom was experiencing a massive number of flight delays and cancellations after 
a lightning strike knocked out its aircraft fueling system, leaving planes unable to refuel. The following statement[1] 
was posted on the Stansted Airport's Twitter page:'Due to an earlier lightning strike, the aircraft fuelling system was 
unavailable for a period this morning. Engineers have been on site and have now restored the system, however, 
flights may still be subject to diversion, delay or cancellation. 
We apologize for the inconvenience and advise all passengers to check with their airlines for their latest flight 
updates.'Having no clear confirmation from the authorities as to when the issues will be resolved and the airport 
fully operational, chaos ensued among passengers waiting to board their respective flights. Steve Childs, who was 
traveling to Madrid with his wife and daughter to see his father during the half-term break, told BBC[2] his Ryanair 
flight was due for 8:25 a.m. GMT (4:25 a.m. EDT) but was delayed indefinitely. He added the most frustrating past 
was the lack of communications from airport officials regarding flight information. "There have been no 
announcements," he said. 'Flights which were due to leave at 06:00 [GMT] still haven't left. We are in the middle of 
the departure hall. Fortunately we have seats, but there are lots of people without." According to Mark Lobel, 
another passenger who was stuck at the airport, there was only a single fueling truck available, attempting to fuel as 
many aircraft as possible. The unprecedented delay meant planes were landing on the airport's tarmac with more 
frequency than flights were taking off, which was creating a backlog. 'As a consequence we're told the airport may 
become too full for planes to land at,' Lobel said in a tweet[3]. Other travelers, who were losing patience, also took 
to Twitter to vent their anger. '@Ryanair canceling many flights at Stansted airport... so upsetting to have my 
daughter's birthday gift being ruined...' wrote[4] social media user Caue Cavallaro, while another user, Cathy 
Winston tweeted[5]: 'Top marks to Stansted airport. There is NO fuel for any planes this morning... And no word on 
when it might turn up. So we're all sitting on the plane waiting waiting waiting...' Here are a few other tweets from 
passengers forced to wait at Stansted Airport:The Met Office in the United Kingdom said there were between 
15,000 and 20,000 lightning strikes across the country overnight. "Temperatures overnight did not fall much below 
15 or 16 degrees, for the end of May that's a pretty hot and humid night so everything was primed,' it said, Sky 
News[6] reported. 'We had some storms coming in from northern France and some building up in the Channel and 
they sort of spread out and have been working their way in.' "It looks like there just one huge area of thundery 
showers that worked across London just before midnight,' it added. Stansted Airport in London was experiencing 
massive number of flight delays and cancellations after a lightning strike knocked out the aircraft fueling system, 
leaving planes unable to refuel. In this photo, passengers prepare to board a low cost flight from Stansted airport,

Highlight: Ryanair’s share price rose last week on the back of record numbers for 2018, but as it braces itself for 
the task of reaching agreement with the unions that it detests, its business model may well have been changed 
forever 
Body
In many ways, Ryanair’s 2018 financial year was a record for the company. Its profits, the airline revealed last 
week, hit an all-time high of €1.45 billion. The number of passengers it carried in the 12 months to the end of March 
climbed by ten million to 130 million. It added more flights to new destinations and countries. It took deliveries of 
even more aircraft.
These are staggering numbers and achievements in the cut-throat airline business. And they helped to push up 
Ryanair’s share price last Monday, when the results were released. However, the rally on the day has still not 
helped the price recover to anywhere near where it was trading late last summer: it remains about 20 per cent 
below what it was during those highs last August.
Partly, that reflects Ryanair’s own view that this year will be tougher. It also reflects the view that last year’s other 
milestone at the airline may have fundamentally changed its business model. Because, alongside all of the record 
financial figures, the airline was forced to accept what nobody had ever expected Ryanair under Michael O’Leary to 
do: recognise the right of trade unions to represent its staff.
The move last September to cancel thousands of flights, due to what Ryanair said was a rostering issue that left the 
airline short of pilots, has had consequences far beyond the couple of months of disruption it caused.
The short-term financial cost from compensating customers was minimal to an airline the size of Ryanair. But 
recognising unions could have a far more lasting financial impact.
More than any other industry, aviation has been vulnerable to industrial action. Planes can’t fly without pilots. 
Expensive jets sitting on tarmac at airports cost a lot of money. O’Leary, more than anyone else, knows that. And 
that is playing on the minds of some investors in Ryanair.
Taking wing in a brave new world
What was once unimaginable - that O’Leary would sit down and discuss pay with union officials as part of a 
collective bargaining process - is now a reality.
The Ryanair boss was unavailable for an interview with this newspaper last week. Nobody from the airline spoke to 
RTÉ on its annual results announcement either. But in a question-and-answer session with an analyst from the 
company’s own stockbroker at Davy, O’Leary was asked about the prospect of further disruptions to flights following 
stoppages in Portugal and Germany in recent months.
“The good thing about this, that I think the key thing about the recognition discussions at the moment is we’re not 
essentially talking about pay,” he said. “Even the unions accept that Ryanair’s pay, both for pilots and cabin crew 
now is ahead of the industry; in fact in many cases, ahead of their unionised competitors in those other countries. 
So what we’re talking about now is the anomalies of Portuguese maternity leave, which actually is inferior to Irish 
maternity leave. And so, the Portuguese union wants, for example, Portuguese maternity leave, but the cabin crew 
wants Irish maternity leave.”
According to the airline, it has so far agreed pay deals in Britain and Italy for pilots, and is currently in pay deal talks 
with unions representing pilots and cabin crew in other countries. The cost of the salary hikes and adding more staff 
as it expands its fleet of aircraft will add about €200 million to its annual wage bill. In a presentation to its investors, 
Ryanair said localised strikes were possible, but added that it would not surrender its low-cost base or model.
In the months since the flight cancellations, however, the unions have gained both in power and strength in their 
negotiations. The Irish airline pilots have still not signed off on a pay deal.
The wider issues facing European aviation may tilt the balance back in favour of Ryanair.
The surge in the cost of oil in recent weeks (following the decision by Donald Trump and the US to pull out of the 
Iran nuclear deal) will cost the industry heavily in the coming months, squeezing profit margins even tighter.
The demise of several airlines, notably Air Berlin, has reminded many pilots that carriers going bust is a regular 
occurrence. Air France has been battling all year with strikes, which cost chief executive Jean-Marc Janaillac his job 
earlier this month when unions rejected the company’s pay rise offer. The French economy minister, Bruno Le 
Maire, has even warned that Air France’s very future is in doubt if it cannot get a pay deal sorted.
In that environment, the demands of pilots for extra pay and perks may be tempered, even if their skills are in 
demand.
As O’Leary told Stephen Furlong of Davy in the Q&A: “I think there is certainly a tightening in the market for pilots in 
the last 12 months. Most of that is because of uncontrolled or madcap expansion by loss-making airlines in Europe, 
most notably Norwegian, which is operating an unsustainable model.
“The Chinese airlines are clearly offering a very significant pay, but China is not the most attractive country to live in 
from a lifestyle point of view. We do not have difficulty in recruiting or attracting pilots. This year, we’ll have another 
1,000-plus pilots. I think if there’s going to be a temporary shortage of pilots, you’ll see it affect more of the regional 
airlines and the smaller jet operators . . . pilots will move from there to the larger operators like Ryanair, like EasyJet 
and others.”
If Ryanair can keep its cost base intact from exploding pay demands by unions, perhaps the share price will react 
much more favourably in the coming months.
Ryanair told investors last week to prepare for lower profits in the current financial year because of higher staff and 
fuel costs. Luck, however, may be on its side. Higher oil prices tend to force weak competition to the wall and 
benefit Ryanair. A shake-out is already under way, as British Airways pursues Norwegian. Many people have bet 
against O’Leary in the past, and lost.

Aryzta plummeted 23 per cent on a profit warning. In a third-quarter trading update, the Swiss-Irish bakery group 
said full-year underlying earnings would be about 10 per cent lower than expected due to labour and distribution 
inflation in North America, rising butter prices and weak consumer spending, particularly in the UK.
Norwegian Air Shuttle gained 2 per cent after Reuters quoted its chief executive, Bjorn Kjos, as confirming that 
Ryanair last year approached the airline with a proposal to take a stake of about 20 per cent. Michael O'Leary, 
Ryanair's CEO, denied to Bloomberg that Ryanair had ever made a bid for Norwegian and said the company was 
"desperate to manufacture bid interest".
Deutsche Bank dropped nearly 5 per cent after Germany's largest lender said the workforce would stand at "well 
below" 90,000 after its restructuring, compared with more than 97,000 now. The brunt of the restructuring will be 
borne by Deutsche's corporate and investment bank, whose cost base will be cut by (EURO)1bn by the end of next 
year. One in four jobs in its equities sales and trading business will be axed. Shares are at their lowest since 
October 2016.

Norwegian Air confirms good summer bookings and Ryanair 's 'interest'
Norwegian Air confirms good summer bookings and Ryanair's 'interest'

The CEO of budget carrier Norwegian Air, under pressure to staff its fleet as it ramps up transatlantic business, said 
on Thursday summer bookings are good and it has "more than enough" pilots to cover the season.
The company, which has been courted by British Airways owner IAG, struggled last summer to have enough pilots 
on duty and had to lease extra planes and staff that weighed on its bottom line.
"We have more than enough pilots this year and we have hired many pilots that we have trained up. We are very 
well covered for the summer," CEO Bjoern Kjos said in an interview with Reuters. Asked whether bookings for the 
busy summer season were strong, Kjos said: "Yes."
Norwegian Air shares rose after the comments. They were up 6.5% to 280 crowns compared to a decline of 0.3% in 
the Oslo Bourse share main index.
Ryanair last year approached Norwegian with a proposal to take a stake of around 20% in the Oslo-listed carrier, a 
source with close knowledge of the discussion separately told Reuters.
Europe's largest and third-largest low-cost airlines respectively, Ryanair and Norwegian compete for passengers as 
well as pilots and crews across the continent.
Kjos said there had been contact between the companies, but declined to discuss any details.
"I can confirm that Ryanair has shown interest in Norwegian Air, and that I brought it up with the board," he said.
A spokesman for the Dublin-based Ryanair said the airline does not comment on rumor or speculation.

IAG last month disclosed it had bought a 4.6% stake in Norwegian, but the budget carrier later said it had rejected 
two takeover proposals.
"What the shareholders should think of is that we are in the initial phase of harvesting significant value following a 
strong expansion. Our growth will begin to level off in the autumn," Kjos said.
He declined to say if there had been any more contact with IAG. (Reuters)

Highlight: Think you know everything there is to know about Europe’s largest southern country? Think again. 
Jessie Collins finds ten intoxicating treasures ready to be discovered in Spain 
Body
The city: Seville
The Spanish city currently on everyone’s lips, Seville is the capital of southern Spain’s Andalucia region, and the 
official home of flamenco and also some of the country’s most dramatic Gothic architecture. But it is the sheer 
amount of culture, art and food contained within this city that makes it such a hot destination right now.
For starters, Seville’s main cathedral is the largest Gothic example in the world, and you can access most corners, 
including the Giralda tower, which dates back to when the building was originally a mosque. A trip to the top also 
rewards with stunning views across the city’s spectacular skyline.
The city’s gastronomy is its heartbeat, with spinach and chickpeas and slow-cooked pork cheek particular 
specialities, as well as all the Iberico ham you can manage, washed down with endless amounts of manzanilla 
sherry. The food markets are standout, teeming with locals and with stalls heaving with fish and seasonal fruit and 
veg. Mercado de la Feria is Seville’s oldest market and is surrounded by tapas bars dispensing great local fare.
A flamenco show is a Sevillian must-see and Casa del Flamenco is the place to head to, with their hour-long shows 
on the historic, Andalucian patio which often feature top artists performing.
In terms of areas, the warren streets opening out on to hidden squares of the original Jewish Quarter of Barrio 
Santa Cruz demand exploration, while the Triana neighbourhood, known for its vibrant flamenco scene and 
delicious tapas should not be missed.

[caption id="attachment_417168" align="alignnone" width="300"] The Vigo coastline[/caption]
Hidden Spain
Tucked away in the north-western tip of the peninsula, Vigo is the gateway city to the area of Galicia, and probably 
still the road least travelled by many tourists. It’s an easy journey from Dublin, though, with Ryanair operating direct 
flights to Vigo itself that are often well priced, and once you get there, you are in the midst of some of the best food 
the country has to offer.
If seafood is your thing, this is the place for you. Using its Atlantic proximity to full effect, typical delicacies include 
octopus, while crabs, oysters, mussels and pimientos de padrón are abundant.
The coastline is wonderful here too, and with 1,500km of inlets and beaches there is so much to explore. Praia das 
Catedrais is just one of the more famous spots, but there are plenty others to discover off your own bat, with O 
Barqueiro and Estaca de Bares perfect little fishing villages to while away the day.
The Galician landscape may also seem familiar; its green mountainous terrain is certainly evocative of our own 
Atlantic shores. Be warned, though, the weather is also more tempestuous than the more Mediterranean areas, and 
very much governed by its Atlantic alignment, so high summer is the time to go if you are looking for a sunny break.
As for the wine, this is Rías Baixas territory, which has given us such drinking jewels as Albariño and Caiño tinto – 
basically, you can’t drink a bad drop here, which is surely halfway to holidaying heaven.

[caption id="attachment_417174" align="alignnone" width="300"] Lago de Sanabria in the province of Zamora: 
Europe’s largest glacial lake[/caption]
Sherry has always had its serious fans (don’t get a sherry lover onto the subject unless you expect to give up a full 
hour of your time), and other than wine, this is a national treasure. For the uninitiated, sherry is a fortified wine 
made from white grapes that are grown near the city of Jerez de la Frontera in Andalucia and comes in a variety of 
tastes and flavours, from light versions such as manzanilla and fino, to darker and heavier ones such as 
Amontillado and oloroso.
You can also get sweet options made from Pedro Ximenez or moscatel grapes, but it is the dry stuff that you will 
mostly find being sipped at the bar. In Spain, sherry bars are a serious experience, and can often be a thing of 
beauty, the drink having its origins back through the centuries, and some dedicated sherry taverns feeling as if they 
do too.
La Venencia in Calle Echegaray in Madrid is probably one of the best of the traditional haunts. The walls are 
smoke-stained yellow, with faded last century posters peeling back to reveal even more layers of smoke-stains, with 
bottles that pre-date Franco lining the shelves.
There is sherry, and only sherry, served here, with barrels of the stuff that would certainly put hairs on most 
people’s chests. To soften the alcohol measures, they serve a small, perfectly formed selection of tapas, all 
designed to match this beloved drink, and are essentially extremely salty, from brined anchovies, green as grass 
olives to almonds, iberico ham and especially salty manchego.
All that, and you may be sharing your experience with the odd cat who wanders in – it’s that kind of place. They 
don’t have a website, but you can find them on Facebook.
[caption id="attachment_417170" align="alignnone" width="300"] The Museo Reina Sofía in Madrid[/caption]
There is so much great art in Spain, with landmark museums such as the Prado and the Guggenheim in Bilbao 
drawing crowds from all over the world year-round. The Museo Reina Sofía, or Queen Sofía Museum in Madrid, 
though not quite as much a household name, is one of Spain’s most vibrant museums, and is also the permanent 
home of Picasso’s seminal Guernica mural, so worth a visit for that alone. There is plenty more besides, with the 
museum dedicated to Spanish art and containing one of the best Picasso and Salvador Dalí collections in the world. 
Contemporary art lives here too, with an upcoming retrospective on Russian Dadaism one to note, while work by 
Hidden Spain
Francis Bacon, Joseph Beuys, Max Ernst, Damien Hirst, Donald Judd, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, René 
Magritte and Henry Moore features in the main contemporary art collection. museoreinasofia.es
[caption id="attachment_417164" align="alignnone" width="300"] Oysters in the Galician port of Vigo[/caption]
Gambas pil pil, croquettes and tortilla need no introduction. What to eat in each region of Spain requires more 
consideration, however, with paella for Valencia, pulpo in Galicia and a dish that deserves a little more time in the 
spotlight is rabo de toro estofado, or braised oxtail. As Spanish as the Armada, don’t let the fact that this is bull’s tail 
put you off. It is slow-cooked in red wine until it melts in your mouth, and packed full of flavour thanks to its rich 
cooking on the bone. Cordoba, Madrid and Pamplona are the places to sample the best rabo de toro, with some 
Pamplona restaurants famous for this delicacy alone.
[caption id="attachment_417166" align="alignnone" width="300"] The Alhambra in Granada[/caption]
Granted, the Alhambra is not unknown, but this palace and fortress complex in Granada, just north of Malaga, is still 
up there in terms of visitor experiences and is one of the best examples of Moorish architecture anywhere, in 
particular the 14th century Palacios Nazaríes, together with the gorgeous Generalife gardens. It is the intricate work 
on show all around, from the glazed tiles, stucco and carved wood that is breathtakingly beautiful; each series of 
courtyards revealing another hidden treasure.
The best way to see the Alhambra is at night, with a kind of tranquility that gives a flavour of how it might have been 
during its height, around the 15th century. Also worth noting, the old town of Granada is a warren of cobbled streets 
all housing tapas bars that dispense food gratis, the tradition being that with each canya, or beer, you get a new 
nibble to try, free of charge. Half the fun lies in trying to get through all the options, and still managing to stand up.
alhambradegranada.org
[caption id="attachment_417169" align="alignleft" width="260"] Alcazar of Segovia[/caption]
Known in this part of the world for its red wine more than perhaps its tourism, the lack of direct flights from here into 
the region might put some off, but in reality its borders are only actually about an hour from Madrid. Situated in the 
more north-western corner of the country, below the northern Basque region, Castilla y Leon contains the magical 
cities of Salamanca, Leon and Segovia, famous for the fairytale castle that inspired the Disney’s Sleeping Beauty 
version.
The food, too, is centre stage, and beloved local dishes of roast lamb and suckling pig are the best anywhere in the 
world. Segovia is possibly within easiest reach of Madrid, and apart from the famous Disney connection, contains 
one of the most extraordinary examples of a Roman aqueduct which traverses its bustling centre.
A little further to the west lies Salamanca, a city that literally glows (it is known as La Dorada, the Golden One), 
thanks to the abundance of its sandstone buildings which are lit up to dramatic effect at night. The architectural mix 
makes this a fascinating destination too, with everything from Romanesque, Gothic, Moorish, Renaissance and 
Baroque all vying for attention.
Salamanca has a unique cuisine too, with hornazo, a savoury pastry stuffed with ham, bacon, sausage and hard-
boiled eggs a local delicacy, as is farinato, a white Spanish sausage typically eaten fried with eggs. And yes, there 
is also suckling pig. This is the home of Spain’s first university, and very much still has a thriving student population, 
adding to its overall sense of fun and energy.
[caption id="attachment_417162" align="alignright" width="219"] The city of Seville[/caption]
Less explored by visitors to Spain, but certainly on the up, is the whole area of nature tourism on the peninsula, and 
there are some remarkably unspoilt protected areas that are also of major geological importance dotted around, 
particularly the province of Zamora. Close to the border with Portugal and in the Castilla y Leon area, Zamora is 
home to Europe’s largest glacial lake, the Sanabria Lake, with the area rich in deep canyons, hanging valleys and a 
series of smaller, glacially formed lakes.
Hidden Spain
There are historical monuments too, with the Cistercian Monastery of Santa Maria, and cultural experiences by way 
of the historic sixth century village of Puebla de Sanabria. The Avila province, west of Madrid, is also worth a visit, 
and contains the Gredos Mountain range, the Iruelas Valley (home to Europe’s largest colony of black vultures), the 
Serrota mountain ranges and a series of cathedral-like caves in the Tiétar Valley, thought to be three million years 
old.
[caption id="attachment_417172" align="alignleft" width="249"] Casa Loewe[/caption]
With origins dating back to 1846, Loewe is still one of the most successful Spanish labels around and, since its 
appointment of the Magherafelt-born JW Anderson as its creative director in 2013, has experienced something of a 
rebirth. The brand is beloved particularly for its leather goods and especially its bags, and remains steadfastly 
Spanish, with all manufacturing still based in Madrid.
When Anderson took over, he made a special point of working with the brands heritage, remodelling Loewe stores 
using designs based on its 1960s outlets, which were designed by architect Javier Carvajal.
He also dipped into the archive for inspiration, bringing back styles and lines from its mid-century heyday, and 
updating its classic Flamenco and Amazona bags, as well as adding a new classic to the mix, the Puzzle bag. This 
was an instant hit with its innovative cuboid shape, buttery leather and multiple forms (it can be worn in five different 
ways, from shoulder bag to clutch).
Loewe stores are dotted around the country, with the flagship address in Madrid remodelled in 2016 under 
Anderson’s eye, which saw it expand to three floors of the landmark 19th-century building in the Salamanca district 
of the capital. It has become something of a love letter to Spain, with almost all the construction materials used 
coming from inside the country’s borders. The art commissioned is a ceramic installation by Spanish artist Gloria 
García Lorca. “I see Casa Loewe as a space in open dialogue with Madrid,” Anderson says. If Madrid isn’t on your 
current checklist, you can find the label’s luxe accessories at Brown Thomas. loewe.com
[caption id="attachment_417175" align="alignnone" width="300"] Hotel Akelarre in San Sebastian[/caption]
Nestled on the hillside of Monte Igueldo just outside San Sebastian, this five-star hotel officially opened last July 
and has already won worldwide acclaim. Pedro Subijana’s Akelarre restaurant has been going since the 1970s, and 
has held three Michelin stars for much of that time, but this is his first foray into an extension of the business and 
with it he has created a nirvana for lovers of food, wine, art, culture and architecture.
The purpose-built modernist space sits next to the original restaurant, overlooking the Bay of Biscay, and it doesn’t 
waste the views. Each of the 22 rooms has a floor-to-ceiling vista of the water, as do the communal spaces, with 
the most luxurious of accommodation, the Akelarre suites, coming complete with plunge pool and dressing room, as 
well as luxe contemporary furnishings and state-of-the-art technology.
As well as the famous restaurant, there is a more casual dining space named Oteiza, which offers a Basque menu 
that will knock your socks off. And there’s a luxury spa too, with a swimming pool, hydrotherapy circuit, steam bath 
and sauna, plus three therapy rooms offering Sisley treatments. Rooms start at about €500.

THE FTSE 100 hit another record high yesterday as an easing in US-Chinese trade tensions and a strengthening 
dollar gave more fuel to the internationally-exposed index.
The index of Britain's biggest companies ended the session up one per cent, hitting a new record high of 7,868.12 
points. The mid-cap FTSE 250 also hit a record of 21,151.32 points, up 0.7 per www.cent.UK equities enjoyed a 
broad-based rally, with all sectors making gains, while financials and energy provided the strongest boost. The 
FTSE 100 has gained nearly five per cent so far this month.
On a calmer day for corporate updates, Ryanair stole the spotlight.
Its shares had a strong swing back into positive territory, up 5.1 per cent, having fallen as much as three per cent at 
the open.
The budget airline said higher fuel and staff costs would hurt profits in its new financial year, but investors focused 
on Ryanair's record earnings for 2017-2018.
"We believe Ryanair's industry-leading competitive advantage remains and thus see no reason to change our 12-
month 'outperform' rating," said Davy Research analysts.
Banks HSBC and Barclays, and insurance company Prudential, provided the big boosts, up 0.7 to 1.1 per cent. Oil 
majors Royal Dutch Shell and BP also climbed as crude prices gained after China and the United States put a 
looming trade war "on hold".
"We are overweight financials with some of the banks and insurers, reflecting a cyclical exposure in terms of global 
growth continuing to do well," said James Illsley, UK equity portfolio manager at JP Morgan Asset Management. 
FTSE 100 hits a fresh high on stronger dollar LONDON REPORT
Despite the index reaching new highs, analysts continue to downgrade earnings for the FTSE 100. The recent 
strengthening of sterling is likely to blame for this.
Overall year-to-date, earnings for the FTSE 350 have been revised up 2.9 per cent, according to Goldman Sachs 
analysts, though they say all of this is attributable to commodity-related sectors.

Ryanair fears impact of rising costs and Brexit Airlines

Ryanair has projected a tough 2019 because of rising jet fuel prices, increased staff costs and the risk of a cliff-
edge Brexit.
The warnings came even as the airline reported a strong increase in passengers and profits in its annual results for 
2018.
Passenger numbers rose 9 per cent to 130m and post-tax profits increased 10 per cent to (EURO)1.45bn, in line 
with the company's earlier guidance. Revenue rose 8 per cent to (EURO)7.15bn and earnings per share were up 15 
per cent to (EURO)1.22.
Ryanair shares rose 3 per cent to (EURO)15.96 by late morning in London trade.
Michael O'Leary, the chief executive, said profits for 2019 would fall to between (EURO)1.25bn and (EURO)1.35bn 
and that he expected a rise of 9 per cent in unit costs, with fuel alone adding (EURO)400m. He said: "Our outlook 
for FY19 is on the pessimistic side of cautious."
At the end of last week, jet fuel prices had increased to 223.77 cents per gallon, an increase of more than 50 per 
cent on the previous year. The airline said it was 90 per cent hedged for 2019 fuel but expected prices to remain 
elevated.
Ryanair fears impact of rising costs and Brexit Airlines
Staff dissatisfaction has led Ryanair to start recognising its pilots' unions. While it has reached agreement in the UK 
and Italy, the Spanish union broke off talks earlier this month and its Irish union recently threatened strikes. Staff 
costs in 2017-18 rose 17 per cent to (EURO)738.5m after early offers of higher pay.
On Brexit, Mr O'Leary noted that if the UK fell out of the EU, in order to remain an EU airline - and thus fly freely 
around the EU - Ryanair would need to be "majority owned and controlled by EU shareholders at all times to 
comply with our licences".
To do this, the company said it might be forced "to restrict the voting rights of all non-EU shareholders". The 
airline's move "would result in non-EU shareholders not being able to vote on shareholder resolutions".
Despite the failure of three European airlines last year, Mr O'Leary said there had been "above average EU 
capacity growth", which would continue into 2019 and put pressure on fares.
Daniel Roeska, analyst at Bernstein, said: "The company's careful wording ... highlights the risk that EU airlines 
may get squeezed between higher fuel prices and lower yields due to higher capacity into 2019."

Ryanair has countered customer moans about its patchy service with the slogan "Always Getting Better" . It worked 
until the Irish low-cost carrier ran out of pilots last year and flights were cancelled. Things have - necessarily - got 
better for these stakeholders ever since. They could hardly have got worse.
The stock price has fallen a fifth since August. Shareholders could do with a little more love too. They will not get 
any soon, given rising European capacity which will hold down fares. Worse, Ryanair says non-EU investors may 
lose their voting rights.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's boss, offered yet another of his cautious assessments in the carrier's full-year results 
yesterday. As usual, he talked down potential for fare rises in coming months. Mr O'Leary also suggested earnings 
would decline a 10th year-onyear, double what analysts were expecting. If that troubled traders, you would not have 
known. Ryanair's share price jumped as much as 5 per cent.
This rally came despite a pointed warning that Ryanair remains prepared to restrict the voting rights of non-EU 
shareholders if Britain leaves the EU without a trade deal. That includes agreements over European air travel. Non-
EU holders can only account for a maximum 49.9 per cent of the shares for European airlines, so this is Ryanair's 
response.
Including both UK shareholders and those holding American Depository Receipts, well over 60 per cent of Ryanair's 
share register is non-EU. Although Ryanair's solution looks elegant, and is permitted under its own articles, EU 
regulators may not accept it. And it takes no account of how shareholders may feel at having their voting rights 
stripped away.
Ryanair: suits EU, sir; Twitter: @FTLex Email: lex@ft.com
So far, ADR holders do not mind. Already these ADRs have no right of conversion into ordinary voting shares. The 
view is that Ryanair's buyback of shares, (EURO)750m this fiscal year to end October, will focus on ADRs. 
Adjusting for the currency, a premium of 23 per cent has built up since autumn last year between the price of these 
ADRs and their underlying equivalent shares. It was a third of that a year ago.
Better is a relative term. Even after raising salaries, Ryanair has the lowest costs among European airlines. As 
capacity rises steadily, revenue per seat should not grow, while oil and staff costs increase. With or without votes, 
airline shares are a poor investment.

LOW-COST carrier Ryanair yesterday reported soaring annual profits, but warned its earnings will fall back in the 
next year due to higher costs and flat fares.
It also gave more insight into its Brexit preparations, with the airline saying it remains concerned at the "likely 
impact" of a hard Brexit. It is planning for this, and said in such circumstances its UK shareholders will be treated as 
non-EU, which could affect its licensing and flight rights.
The airline said profit after tax had risen 10 per cent to (EURO)1.5bn (£1.3bn) for the year, with revenue rising eight 
per cent to (EURO)7.2bn.
Passenger numbers were up nine per cent to 130m, with a sky-high load factor - which assesses how efficiently an 
airline fills its planes - at 95 per cent.
But its outlook for the 2019 financial year was "on the pessimistic side of cautious". It expects traffic to grow by 
seven per cent to 139m, with load factors flat at 95 per cent.

RYANAIR is among the worstperforming airline stocks over the past year that has been marked by union disputes 
and rising costs.
Analysis by Thomson Reuters shows that the once buoyant stock has fallen to the back of the pack along with 
SouthWest, United Continental and Air France-KLM, in terms of positive share price change.
Air France's place at the bottom of the pile is not surprising given the airline's troubles over the resignation of its 
CEO Jean-Marc Janaillac and ongoing strikes.
Meanwhile, Hungarian low-cost airline Wizz Air tops the charts with a 61 per cent jump in share price over the year, 
followed by Lufthansa, China Southern and Scandinavian Airlines.
Russ Mould, investment director at analyst AJ Bell, said shareholders seemed to be taking the cautious tone struck 
by the low-cost airline "in their stride", citing a climb in shares yesterday.
"This may be a reflection of the company management's long-term track record of getting it right and providing 
customers with what they want, hopes that the spat with the unions is over and that further consolidation in the 
airline business will help keep supply and demand in balance."

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY), a provider of passenger airlines services, reported Monday FY18 earnings of EUR1.20 
($1.41) per share, up from EUR1.05 per share in the prior year, which fell short of the $1.45 per share consensus of 
analysts polled by Capital IQ. 
Revenue for the year ended March 31 was EUR7.15 billion, up from EUR6.65 billion reported last year, and above 
the EUR7.09 billion mean estimate. 
For fiscal 2019, the carrier now expects profits to fall to a range of EUR1.25 billion to EUR1.35 billion as it does not 
expect ancillary revenue growth to fully offset higher costs and lower fares. 
"Our outlook for FY19 is on the pessimistic side of cautious," the company said in its statement.
"We expect to grow traffic by 7% to 139 million, at flat load factors of 95%. Unit costs this year will rise 9% due to 
higher staff and oil prices which will, when adjusted for volume growth, add more than EUR400m to our fuel bill. Ex-
fuel unit cost will rise by up to 6% as we annualise pilot and cabin crew pay increases, and invest in our business 
and our systems to facilitate a six-year growth plan to 600 aircraft and 200 million guests [per year]."

 US equity futures were up sharply early Monday following positive US-China trade headers but holidays globally 
weighed on volumes, said Dave Lutz, head of ETFs at Jones Trading. S&P futures added 60 points, but the Dow 
Jones futures rose nearly 1% so far. 
It was quiet overnight in Europe as Germany's markets were closed. The EU Stoxx added 15 points as travel stocks 
rallied behind RyanAir on numbers, and commodity stocks were bid but gains were tempered by selling in the 
financials. Italian markets fell 2% under political headlines and dividend payments, but have since rallied back to 40 
points below breakeven.  In London, the FTSE hit record highs, with every sector climbing, led by consumer and 
healthcare.  
There was a sea of green in Asia on trade headlines - Nikkei rose 30 points, Hang Seng rose 60 points and 
Shanghai added 65 points to five-week highs as environmental stocks rallied on Xi's comments. Taiwan rose 1.2%, 
the KOSPI added 20 points and the Aussie closed slightly below breakeven as CBA hit a nearly two-year low.
The US 10Y yield rose 1 basis point and Fed Funds got the week underway with a 54% chance of four hikes in 
2018 ahead of Fed minutes and a gaggle of FOMC speakers, including Fed chairman Powell, this week. The dollar 
hit a fresh five-month high amid a slump in the euro as Italian bonds fell after BTP yields edged toward October 
highs. Sterling continued to drop on angst over Brexit and weaker economic data, while dollar-yen rose above 
Y111.  
Turkey's lira fell, while the Mexico's peso and loonie shrugged off negative NAFTA headers. In commodities, ore fell 
2.7% as headers of record stockpiles weighed in Dalian, but copper rose 1.3%, while gold fell sharply on dollar 
strength.

 The following is a summary of top news stories Monday.----------COMPANIES----------Barclays said the Crown 
Court has dismissed all charges brought by the UK Serious Fraud Office against Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank 
PLC related to its capital raising in 2008. However, the bank said the SFO is likely to seek to re-instate the charges 
by applying to a High Court judge to re-commence proceedings via a new indictment of the same charges.----------
Ryanair Holdings reported that revenue in its recent financial year increased on the back of lower fares and traffic 
growth, despite September's "rostering management failure". The Irish budget airline's revenue reached EUR7.15 
billion, a 7.7% increase year-on-year from EUR6.64 billion in 2017. For the financial year that ended in March, 
Ryanair said pretax profit rose 10% to EUR1.61 billion, up from EUR1.47 billion the prior year. The company said 
this was due to lower fares increasing passenger traffic by 9%. In the past year, Ryanair lowered fares by 3% with 
the average flight cost at EUR39.4, it said. Last September, Ryanair was forced to cancel 20,000 flights after a rota 
mix-up led to pilot shortage, disrupting the travel plans of more than 700,000 passengers. 
----------AstraZeneca said the US Food & Drug Administration approved its hyperkalaemia drug Lokelma. Lokelma, 
formerly known as ZS-9, is used to treat adults with hyperkalaemia, a condition characterised by elevated 
potassium levels in the blood, associated with cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases. The FDA approval 
follows three double-blind, placebo controlled trials and two open label clinical trials providing data to support the 
efficacy of the drug.----------MARKETS----------The FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 indices hit record highs of 7,848.82 and 
21,117.20 respectively as trade tensions between the US and China cooled. The pound was down against the 
dollar benefiting overseas companies in the internationally-exposed large cap index. Wall Street was called for a 
higher open amid the prospect of a US-China ceasefire with major stock indices pointed up 0.7% to 0.9%. ----------

Ryanair Meets Profit Forecast for Fiscal 2018 But Warns of Lower Earnings

 The low-cost European airline Ryanair (RYAAY, RYA.L) reported early Monday a pre-tax profit at the top end of 
fiscal 2018 forecasts, but it offered a "pessimistic side of cautious" outlook for the current financial year after a 
rostering debacle in September pushed up staffing costs.
The airline, which saw trade unions enter its fold for the first time in its history as pilots and cabin crew demanded 
higher wages, said in its earnings statement that sales surged to 7.15 billion euros ($9.63 billion) in the 12 months 
to March 31, from 6.65 billion euros a year ago. That compared with an $8.52 billion average analyst sales forecast 
compiled by Yahoo Finance.
Ryanair noted that a 3% decline in fares stimulated 9% traffic growth to over 130 million passengers and an 
"industry-leading" 95% load factor, overcoming the grounding 25 winter aircraft and thousands of flight cancellations 
in the fourth quarter. 
In line with higher revenues, the company said profit-before-tax climbed to 1.45 billion euros, from 1.31 billion 
euros, a year earlier, and compared with a 1.40-1.45 billion-euro internal forecast.
But, looking ahead, the company said unit costs in the fiscal year 2019 would rise 9% due to higher staff and oil 
prices, which will, when adjusted for volume growth, add more than 400 million to the airline's fuel bill.
Excluding fuel, unit cost is forecast to rise by up to 6% as Ryanair annualizes pilot and cabin crew pay increases, 
and invests in business and systems to facilitate a six-year growth plan to 600 aircraft and 200 million passengers 
annually.
Noting the "limited" first-half and "zero" second-half fare visibility as well as softer pricing, Ryanair said it did not 
expect ancillary revenue growth to fully offset higher costs and lower fares. As a result, it warned, profit would fall to 
a range of 1.25-1.35 billion euros in the full year.

 Ryanair Holdings on Monday declared itself "on the pessimistic side of cautious" for 2019, despite the Irish budget 
airline reporting higher annual revenue and profit that in its recent financial year on the back of lower fares and 
traffic growth
The airline's revenue reached EUR7.15 billion, an 7.7% increase year-on-year from EUR6.64 billion in 2017. It said 
this was achieved despite September's "rostering management failure", which saw it forced to cancel flights due to 
staff shortages.
For the financial year that ended in March, Ryanair said pretax profit rose 10% to EUR1.61 billion, up from EUR1.47 
billion the prior year. The company said this was due to lower fares increasing passenger traffic by 9%.
In the past year, Ryanair lowered fares by 3% with the average flight cost at EUR39.4, it said.
"Average fares last year declined by 3%, which was good news for our guests but bad news for competitors," the 
company said.
Germany, Italy and Spain were the airline's largest growth markets, and the company said it expects "above 
average EU capacity" to continue in the new year.
However, Ryanair said it expects prices to be affected by higher oil prices' impact, with fuel costs expected to add 
more than EUR400 million to the company's fuel bill.
For the past financial year Ryanair fuel bill amounted to EUR1.9 billion.
"We expect the market for experienced pilots in Europe to remain tight for the next 12 months, and accordingly, this 
will continue to put upward pressure on staff costs for all EU airlines," Ryanair said.
For financial 2019, Ryanair said it expected traffic growth of 7% and profit between EUR1.3 billion ad EUR1.4 
billion. The stock was down 1.7% at the London open Monday.

Consumer stocks eased somewhat on Monday, with shares of consumer staples companies in the S&P 500 
climbing almost 0.3% this afternoon while shares of consumer discretionary firms in the S&P 500 were ahead about 
0.5% in recent trading. 
Among consumer stocks moving on news: 
+ World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) climbed to a new record high on Monday, rising almost 16% to a best-ever 
$59.45 a share, following reports the company has made an in-principle decision to air "SmackDown Live" on Fox 
(FOX,FOXA) after the television network approached it with a "massive" offer. The broadcast deal is expected to 
kick off in October 2019, according to an ESPN news report, although it also said additional details of the 
arrangement were "unknown." WWE declined to comment on the ESPN report, while a Fox spokesperson could not 
immediately be reached by the news agency.

Sector Update: Consumer Stocks Hang On For Slim Gains
+ Ryanair (RYAAY,RYA.L) was trading higher on Monday, posting a nearly 4% gain after earlier reporting a pre-tax 
profit at the top of its FY18 forecast range but also offering up a forecast on the "pessimistic side of cautious" for the 
current fiscal year. The discount airline earned EUR7.15 billion, or about $9.63 billion, during the 12 months ended 
March 31, improving on EUR6.65 billion in net income during the year-ago period and cruising past the Capital IQ 
consensus by $1.11 billion. But looking ahead, the company also is expecting its unit costs to rise by up to 6% 
during FY19 due to higher staff and oil prices, including a more than EUR400 million increase in its fuel bill over 
FY18 levels. Ryanair also said it is not expecting revenue growth this year to fully offset those rising costs and an 
softer ticket pricing environment and resulting in net income in a range of EUR1.25 billion to EUR1.35 billion.
+ Tesla (TSLA) was roughly 4% higher on Monday after analysts at Berenberg Bank raised their price target for the 
electric-vehicle manufacturer by $30 to $500 a share and also reiterating their Buy rating for the company's stock. 
The move follows Tesla on Saturday unveiling two separate versions of its Model 3 sedan, including an all-wheel 
drive vehicle starting a $78,000 that can go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds and reach a top speed of 
a 155 mph. A less costly model will require an extra second to reach 60 miles per hour and top out at around 140 
mph. Separately, Institutional Shareholder Services on Saturday backed a shareholder proposal to split the roles of 
board chairman and chief executive officer at Tesla that are now jointly held by Elon Musk, according to reports by 
Bloomberg and Reuters. 
- Pinnacle Foods (PF) has turned narrowly lower Monday afternoon, giving back a nearly 2% advance that earlier 
followed reports the food-distributor late Friday hired Evercore Partners to assist the company with evaluating 
strategic alternatives in response to demands by an activist hedge fund. Jana Partners reportedly is pressing 
Pinnacle Foods to merge with ConAgra Foods (CAG) in a deal that would create the second-biggest U.S. frozen-

 Consumer shares were higher ahead of the opening bell on Monday, with Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) up 0.5%, 
McDonald's (MCD) up 0.4%, Procter and Gamble (PG) up 0.4%, CVS (CVS) flat, the Walt Disney Company (DIS) 
up 0.4%, and the Coca Cola Company (KO) up 0.5%. 
In stocks news, low-cost European airline Ryanair (RYAAY, RYA.L) reported early Monday a pre-tax profit at the 
top end of fiscal 2018 forecasts, but it offered a "pessimistic side of cautious" outlook for the current financial year 
after a rostering debacle in September pushed up staffing costs.
The airline, which saw trade unions enter its fold for the first time in its history as pilots and cabin crew demanded 
higher wages, said in its earnings statement that sales surged to 7.15 billion euros ($9.63 billion) in the 12 months 
to March 31, from 6.65 billion euros a year ago. That compared with an $8.52 billion average analyst sales forecast 
compiled by Yahoo Finance.
In line with higher revenue, the company said profit-before-tax climbed to 1.45 billion euros, from 1.31 billion euros, 
a year earlier, and compared with a 1.40-1.45 billion-euro internal forecast.
Noting the "limited" first-half and "zero" second-half fare visibility as well as softer pricing, Ryanair said it did not 
expect ancillary revenue growth to fully offset higher costs and lower fares. As a result, it warned, profit would fall to 
a range of 1.25-1.35 billion euros in the full year.

Britain 's FTSE 100 hits fresh record high

Britain's FTSE 100 notched up a fresh record high on Monday, rising strongly as an easing in Sino-U.S. trade 
tensions and a strengthening dollar gave more fuel to the internationally-exposed index.
The index of Britain's biggest companies was up 0.8% at 0850 GMT, hitting a new record high at 7,838.55 points. 
The mid-cap FTSE 250 also hit a record in early trading at 21,092.72 points, up 0.5%.
UK equities enjoyed a broad-based rally, with all sectors making gains, while financials and energy provided the 
strongest boosts. The FTSE 100 has gained 7% in the past month.
"I don't think sentiment has changed towards the UK stock market dramatically over the last 2 to 6 months," said 
James Illsley, UK equity portfolio manager at JP Morgan Asset Management, saying the FTSE 100's exposure to 
international growth was instead the most likely driver.
"This morning news of the easing of trade tensions for China and the U.S. has been driving stocks up," he added.
On a calmer day for corporate updates, Ryanair stole the spotlight. Its shares had a strong swing back into positive 
territory, up 2.9%, having fallen as much as 3% at the open.
The budget airline said higher fuel and staff costs would hurt profits in its new financial year, but investors focused 
on Ryanair's record earnings for 2017-2018.
"We believe Ryanair's industry-leading competitive advantage remains and thus see no reason to change our 12-
month 'outperform' rating," said Davy Research analysts.
Britain 's FTSE 100 hits fresh record high
Banks HSBC and Barclays, and insurance company Prudential, provided the biggest boosts, up 1 to 1.4%. Oil 
majors Royal Dutch Shell and BP also climbed as crude prices gained after China and the United States put a 
looming trade war "on hold."
"We are overweight financials with some of the banks and insurers, reflecting a cyclical exposure in terms of global 
growth continuing to do well," said Illsley.
Despite the index reaching new highs, analysts continue to downgrade earnings for the FTSE100. The recent 
strengthening of sterling is likely to blame for this.
"You could see some of that technical FX downgrade reverse," said Illsley. "When you actually talk to companies by 
and large they are positive."
Overall year-to-date, earnings for the FTSE 350 have been revised up 2.9%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts, 
though they say all of this is attributable to commodity-related sectors. (Reuters)

Consumer stocks were advancing Monday, with shares of consumer staples companies in the S&P 500 climbing 
almost 0.5% in afternoon trading while shares of consumer discretionary firms in the S&P 500 were ahead about 
0.6% in recent trading. 
Among consumer stocks moving on news: 
- Pinnacle Foods (PF) has turned narrowly lower Monday afternoon, giving back a nearly 2% advance that earlier 
followed reports the food-distributor late Friday hired Evercore Partners to assist the company with evaluating 
strategic alternatives in response to demands by an activist hedge fund. Jana Partners reportedly is pressing 
Pinnacle Foods to merge with ConAgra Foods (CAG) in a deal that would create the second-biggest US frozen-
foods company, with a combined market share of 27%, according to the New York Post, citing unnamed sources 
familiar with the matter. Jana Partners recently increased its Pinnacle stake to 9.5% and also has been a major 
investor in ConAgra for several years, including a presence on its board of directors.

Sector Update: Consumer Stocks Moderately Higher Monday
+ Ryanair (RYAAY,RYA.L) was trading higher on Monday, posting a nearly 4% gain after earlier reporting a pre-tax 
profit at the top of its FY18 forecast range but also offering up a forecast on the "pessimistic side of cautious" for the 
current fiscal year. The discount airline earned EUR7.15 billion, or about $9.63 billion, during the 12 months ended 
March 31, improving on EUR6.65 billion in net income during the year-ago period and cruising past the Capital IQ 
consensus by $1.11 billion. But looking ahead, the company also is expecting its unit costs to rise by up to 9% 
during FY19 due to higher staff and oil prices, including a more than EUR400 million increase in its fuel bill over 
FY18 levels. Ryanair also said it is not expecting revenue growth this year to fully offset those rising costs and an 
softer ticket pricing environment and resulting in net income in a range of EUR1.25 billion to EUR1.35 billion.
+ Tesla (TSLA) was roughly 4% higher on Monday after analysts at Berenberg Bank raised their price target for the 
electric-vehicle manufacturer by $30 to $500 a share and also reiterated their Buy rating for the company's stock. 
The move follows Tesla on Saurday unveiling two separate versions of its Model 3 sedan, including an all-wheel 
drive vehicle starting a $78,000 that can go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds and reach a top speed of 
a 155 mph. A less costly model will require an extra second to reach 60 miles per hour and top out at around 140 
mph. Separately, Institutional Shareholder Services on Saturday backed a shareholder proposal to split the roles of 
board chairman and chief executive officer at Tesla that are now jointly held by Elon Musk, according to reports by 
Bloomberg and Reuters.

 European markets ended the first session of the new trading week with gains. Investors were encouraged by the 
easing trade tensions between the US and China. The countries will refrain from new tariffs that may have sparked 
a trade war.
"To meet the growing consumption needs of the Chinese people and the need for high-quality economic 
development, China will significantly increase purchases of US goods and services," China and the US said. "This 
will help support growth and employment in the US."
Trading was a bit thinner in Europe today, with several markets closed for the Whit Monday holiday. Economic data 
was also scarce both in the Eurozone and in the US.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index advanced 0.35%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks

 European stocks were broadly higher at midday on Monday, with UK markets hitting a record high, as easing trade 
war worries boosted the dollar against major currencies and helped lift exporters.
After two days of high-level talks, the US and China have agreed to put the trade war on hold and set up a 
framework for addressing trade imbalances in the future.
The pan-European Stoxx 600 index was up 0.4% at 396.40 in late opening deals after falling around 0.3% on 
Friday on concerns over geopolitics and trade.
France's CAC 40 index was rising 0.7% and the UK's FTSE 100 was up 0.9% to reach a record high, while the 
German DAX was down about 0.3%.
French energy group EDF rallied 1.7% on reports that it is in talks to sell part of its UK wind farms.

 The FTSE 100 is set to open at an all-time high on Monday, coming after trade tensions between the US and 
China eased over the weekend.
In early UK company news on Monday, AstraZeneca said the US Food & Drug Administration has approved 
Lokelma, NewRiver REIT confirmed it is in talks to buy Hawthorn Leisure Holdings, and Ryanair reported a strong 
rise in annual profit but was cautious on its outlook for the year ahead.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 41.01 points higher at 7,819.80 on Monday. The 
blue-chip index closed down 0.1%, or 9.18 points, at 7,778.79 on Friday. 
The index's current record intraday high stands at 7,792.56, a level which was reached in January of this year.
"The continued buoyancy in European markets is being helped in no small part by the weakness in both the euro 
and the pound against the US dollar, while concerns about an escalation in tensions between China and the US 
appear to have been deferred in the short term after progress in trade talks at the weekend," says CMC Markets 
chief market analyst Michael Hewson.
In early UK company news on Monday, drugmaker AstraZeneca said the US FDS has approved Lokelma, formerly 
ZS-9, for the treatment of adults with hyperkalaemia.
Hyperkalaemia is characterised by elevated potassium levels in the blood, associated with cardiovascular, renal 
and metabolic diseases. The FDA approval is supported by data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials 
and two open-label trials.
"We are pleased by today's FDA approval of Lokelma as it enables us to help address a long-standing clinical need 
with a new medicine that offers rapid and sustained treatment for adults with hyperkalaemia," said Sean Bohen, 
executive vice president, global medicines development and chief medical officer at AstraZeneca.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: FTSE 100 Set For All-Time Record At Open
Seperately, the blue-chip pharmaceutical firm said it has submitted a supplemental new drug application to Japan's 
Pharmaceuticals & Medical Devices Agency for the use of Forxiga - a selective sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 
inhibitor - as an oral adjunct treatment to insulin in adults with type-1 diabetes.
Forxiga is also under regulatory review in Europe.
Noting press reports, FTSE 250-listed NewRiver REIT confirmed it has entered a period of exclusivity with pub 
company Hawthorn Leisure Holdings and its major shareholder regarding a potential acquisition of the business. 
"A transaction, if completed, would be funded from NewRiver's existing resources. There can be no certainty that a 
transaction will be concluded and a further announcement, as appropriate, will be made as soon as practicable," 
NewRiver said.
Online gaming firm Playtech said it has received formal consent from the Italian gaming regulatory authority, 
Agenzia delle Dogane e dei Monopoli, for its purchase of a 70.6% stake in Snaitech.
The deal, first announced in April, will see Playtech subsequently make a mandatory takeover offer for the 
remaining shares in Snaitech after buying its 70.6% stake.
Budget airline Ryanair Holdings reported a 10% increase in annual profit after tax to EUR1.45 billion, saying that 
lower fares - which were down 3% - stimulated 9% traffic growth to over 130 million passengers. 
Full year 2018 total operating revenue from continuing operations rose 8% year-over-year to EUR7.15 billion. 
Traffic grew 9% with Germany, Italy and Spain being the company's largest growth markets.
However, the airline said its outlook for the year ahead is "on the pessimistic side of cautious". The company 
expects to grow traffic by 7% to 139 million, at flat load factors of 95%. Unit costs in the current year will rise 9%.
In addition, Ryanair said it has "limited" first half and "zero" second half fare visibility, with forward booking strong 
but pricing soft.
"Since only half of Easter fell in April, we expect a 5% fare decline in Q1 but a 4% rise in Q2 fares. While still too 
early to accurately forecast close-in summer bookings or H2 fares, we are cautiously guiding broadly flat average 
fares for FY19," Ryanair said.
Elsewhere on the Main Market, 4D Pharma said the UK Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has 
cleared a Clinical Trial Application for MRx0518, a live biotherapeutic cancer treatment. 
Enrolment in the Phase 1b study is expected to commence in the second half of 2018, 4D said.
"This groundbreaking study is set to be the world's first live biotherapeutic clinical trial in oncology and the first of a 
number of studies we have planned to investigate MRx0518 in multiple cancer settings," said Chief Executive 
Duncan Peyton
In the US on Friday, Wall Street ended mostly lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending flat, the S&P 
500 down 0.3% and Nasdaq Composite closing 0.4% lower.
Chinese Vice Premier Liu, who travelled to the US on Tuesday for negotiations, told Chinese news outlet Xinhua 
that both countries had agreed to "not to engage in a trade war" and "stop slapping tariffs against each other".
He said that both countries had pledged to cooperate further in a "win-win choice" that would promote the "high-
quality development of the Chinese economy".
Liu's comments follow a joint statement released by the White House Saturday that China would begin buying more 
US goods and services to reduce the US trade deficit and meet Chinese consumption needs.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: FTSE 100 Set For All-Time Record At Open
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday said the US is "putting the trade war on hold" and won't impose 
tariffs for now while it works on a framework for trade with China. 
In Asia on Monday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.3%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 0.8%, 
while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.9%.
Released early Monday, Japan's trade surplus for April came in at JPY626.0 billion, or around USD5.6 billion, 
boosted by strong demand for Japanese cars and manufacturing equipment overseas.
Exports were up 7.8% to JPY6.822 trillion, outpacing a 5.9% rise in imports to JPY6.196 trillion, according to a 
preliminary report by the Finance Ministry. By region, Japan saw its trade surplus against the US rising 4.7% to 
JPY615.7 billion thanks to a rise in car exports.
In the UK on Monday, Rightmove said house prices were up 0.8% on month in May, which follows a 0.4% rise in 
April. On a yearly basis, house prices advanced 1.1%, slowing from 1.6% in the previous month.
Meanwhile, a survey by IHS Markit and Ipsos Mori showed British households' current financial pressures softened 
in May, helped by a combination of lower inflation and higher income from employment this spring.
The seasonally adjusted Household Finance Index, or HFI, rose to 44.7 in May from 43.4 in April. The figure 
signaled a softer budget squeeze, with the latest deterioration being the least marked since the end of 2016. 
However, any score below 50 suggests pessimism regarding finances among the UK households.
"Following the accurate prediction by the majority of households of no base rate change in May, the forecast has 
since remained broadly unchanged," Sam Teague, an economist at IHS Markit, said.
"Over half of all households are expecting a rate hike over the course of 2018, though only one-in four expect to 
see rates rise by August."
To come in a thin economic events calendar on Monday there is the Chicago Fed National Activity Index at 1330 
BST. Markets in Germany and Switzerland are closed for the Whit Monday holiday on Monday.

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - U.K. stocks rose sharply on Monday to approach a record high 
as investors cheered the outcome of trade negotiations between the United States and China.  After two days of 
high-level talks, the two sides have agreed to put the trade war on hold and set up a framework for addressing trade

 The trade optimism as well as newspaper reports that the Conservative Party was preparing for another election

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - European stocks were broadly higher on Monday, with U.K. 
markets hitting a record high, as easing trade war worries boosted the dollar against major currencies and helped 
lift exporters.  After two days of high-level talks, the U.S. and China have agreed to put the trade war on hold and 
set up a framework for addressing trade imbalances in the future.  The pan-European Stoxx 600 index was up 0.4 
percent at 396.40 in late opening deals after falling around 0.3 percent on Friday on concerns over geopolitics and 
trade. 
  France's CAC 40 index was rising 0.7 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was up 0.9 percent to reach a record high, 
while the German DAX was down about 0.3 percent.   French energy group EDF rallied 1.7 percent on reports that 
it is in talks to sell part of its U.K. wind farms.  British power company Drax climbed 2.5 percent. The company said 
its bioenergy carbon capture storage (Beccs) project of its type in Europe would eventually make it carbon negative.  
Airline Ryanair Holdings jumped 3.7 percent after posting a record annual profit.  AstraZeneca advanced 2.3 
percent. The company has submitted a supplemental new drug application to Japan's Pharmaceuticals and Medical 
Devices Agency for use as an oral adjunct treatment to insulin in adults with type-1 diabetes.   International 
Consolidated Airlines Group gained 1.2 percent on the buzz that the British Airways-parent plans to offer \xA41.52 
billion for Norwegian Air Shuttle.  Commodities trader Glencore edged lower following reports that it is facing a 
bribery probe over its Congolese operations.

Ryanair has turned in a 10% rise in full-year net profit to 1.45 billion ($1.7 billion), but is not expecting to reach the 
same level next year.
The airline is forecasting a profit of 1.25-1.35 billion for 2018-19.
Ryanair has opted for an outlook on the "pessimistic side of cautious", because it expects higher oil prices which 
will add 400 million to its fuel expenditure.
While passenger numbers will rise by 7% to 139 million, it says load factors will stay flat at 95%.
It adds that its non-fuel unit costs will rise by up to 6% as a result of higher salaries for cockpit and cabin crew. The 
airline is also investing ahead of plans to expand its fleet from 430 to 600 aircraft.
"Forward bookings are strong but pricing remains soft," says the carrier. It says it is "cautiously" forecasting "broadly 
flat" average fares for 2018-19.
Ryanair says it does not expect ancillary revenues to offset the impact of higher costs and lower fares.
It outlook excludes the investment in Austrian operator Laudamotion because it has yet to secure regulatory 
clearance.
Ryanair achieved its full-year profit rise for 2017-18 despite a 3% fall in fares and the fallout from its high-profile 
pilot rostering problems.
The airline managed to increase passenger numbers by 9% to 130 million and cut unit costs by 1% – although non-
fuel unit costs rose by 3%.

Ryanair says the European environment is still subject to overcapacity, and it states that it expects "above average" 
European Union capacity growth to continue over 2018-19.
"This may be partly ameliorated by the switch of some charter capacity back to previously security-challenged 
markets such as Turkey and Egypt," it states.
"We expect later in the year, some upward pressure on pricing as significantly higher oil prices impact margins, 
especially those EU airlines who continue to expand despite having no prospect of achieving profitability."

European airlines are facing a "precarious" transition as uncertainty surrounding Britain's exit from the EU 
intensifies in the industry.
Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair's chief marketing officer, said he feared "hardcore Brexiters" were putting in doubt a draft 
transition deal that would allow airlines to continue flying freely between the UK and EU.
Theresa May had agreed to the draft transition in March but Mr Jacobs feared pressure from pro-Brexit MPs would 
lead to the deal not being signed. It would mean there was no UK-EU agreement in place after Britain's exit.
If this happens, Ryanair, which is based in Ireland, would lose rights to fly freely into the UK, and its few intra-UK 
routes could also be impaired. From the UK's perspective, airlines based in Britain, including British Airways and 
Virgin Atlantic, would also lose rights to fly freely into the EU and US.
Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, has previously warned of the threat to airlines from Brexit. In the 
company's full-year results for 2016-17, he said: "Until we get clarity over the final terms of the UK's future trading 
relationship with the EU, there must be significant uncertainty over flights between the UK and the EU for a period 
of time from March 2019 onwards."
Mr Jacobs' warning comes at a difficult time for European carriers. Air France-KLM is looking for a permanent chief 
executive after unions forced the resignation of Jean-Marc Janaillac this month. Strikes have cost it more than 
(EURO)300m.
EU airlines risk having wings clipped over Brexit transition Airlines
In 2017, three mid-size European airlines went bankrupt - Alitalia, Air Berlin and Monarch - while BA, which took a 
4.6 per cent stake in Norwegian Air, has had two proposals to buy the airline rejected by the board.
Mr Jacobs said he wished President Emmanuel Macron of France "Godspeed" with his efforts to reform French 
institutions, including Air France-KLM, of which the state owns 14 per cent.
Ryanair could face ownership issues after Brexit too. EU regulations say that the bloc's airlines should be 
majorityowned by EU nationals. According to the latest estimates, Ryanair is 60 per cent owned by EU nationals but 
that drops to 40 per cent once UK shareholders are excluded.
Mr Jacobs said this was not a "straightforward" problem given the airline's significant UK shareholders, who were 
considering options including moving their holdings from London to Frankfurt and even selling them down.
In March, the Financial Times reported that UK-based airlines would suffer a similar problem. Under the terms of a 
post-Brexit bilateral deal, the US would expect British airlines to be majority-owned and controlled by British parties. 
British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Norwegian UK have large foreign shareholders.
Willie Walsh, the chief executive of IAG, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, said the company would not face 
any ownership issues as a result of Brexit. But Mr Jacobs said Ryanair was "more realistic" than Mr Walsh.

majorityowned by EU nationals. According to the latest estimates, Ryanair is 60 per cent owned by EU nationals but 
that drops to 40 per cent once UK shareholders are excluded.
Mr Jacobs said this was not a "straightforward" problem given the airline's significant UK shareholders, who were 
considering options including moving their holdings from London to Frankfurt and even selling them down.
In March, the Financial Times reported that UK-based airlines would suffer a similar problem. Under the terms of a 
post-Brexit bilateral deal, the US would expect British airlines to be majority-owned and controlled by British parties. 
British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Norwegian UK have large foreign shareholders.
Willie Walsh, the chief executive of IAG, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, said the company would not face 
any ownership issues as a result of Brexit. But Mr Jacobs said Ryanair was "more realistic" than Mr Walsh.

Highlight: Ryanair has reported a 10% increase in full year profit after tax to 1.45bn, as lower fares (down 3%) 
stimulated 9% traffic growth to over 130m guests, and an industry leading 95% load factor.
Body
Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said:"We are pleased to report a 10% increase in profits, with an unchanged net 
margin of 20%, despite a 3% cut in air fares, during a year of overcapacity in Europe, leading to a weaker fare 
environment, rising fuel prices, and the recovery from our Sept. 2017 rostering management failure. Highlights of 
the last year include: Traffic grew 9% to over 130m, despite grounding 25 winter aircraft Average fare fell 3% to just 
39.40 Unit costs were cut by 1% (ex-fuel they rose +3%) Ryanair Labs stimulated record ancillary spend (+4% per 
guest) We took delivery of 50 B737 aircraft, bringing the fleet to 430 units We created 1,500 new jobs, and over 600 
promotions New 5 year pay deals were concluded with most of our pilots and cabin crew Over 800m was returned 
to shareholders via buybacks We recovered quickly from the Sept. 2017 pilot rostering failureSales: Average fares 
last year declined by 3%, which was good news for our guests but bad news for competitors. Traffic grew 9% to 
over 130m with Germany, Italy and Spain being our 3 largest growth markets. 
We expect above average EU capacity growth to continue into FY19, which will have a downward effect on fares. 
This may be partly ameliorated by the switch of some charter capacity back to previously security challenged 
markets such as Turkey and Egypt. We expect later in the year, some upward pressure on pricing as significantly 
higher oil prices impact margins, especially those EU airlines who continue to expand despite having no prospect of 
achieving profitability. Ryanair will continue to pursue our load factor active/yield passive strategy. No other EU 
airline can compete with Ryanair's prices.During FY18 we took delivery of 50 new B737's, and increased our 
Boeing order to 135 firm MAX-200 Gamechangers, with a further 75 under option (210 in total). We opened 4 bases 
in Burgas, Memmingen, Naples & Poznan and launched over 260 new routes. This summer, we have announced 
over 200 new routes including markets in Jordan, Turkey and the Ukraine. We continue to grow strongly in 
Germany, Italy and the UK, and our Polish charter airline, Ryanair Sun, operated its first flights in April 
2018.Ancillaries, Labs & Customer Service:Ryanair Labs continues to deliver improvements in Customer Service, 
mobile & digital platforms, and our ancillary sales conversions. Labs has established 3 development offices in 
Dublin, Wroclaw, and Madrid, and employs almost 600 highly skilled digital professionals."MyRyanair" membership 
Ryanair reports 10% increase in full year profit after tax to 1.45bn
has grown to 43m, while our website & app has over 1 billion visits p.a. Our improved mobile and digital platforms 
have delivered a 13% increase in ancillary revenues (+4% per guest) to over 2bn. Ancillaries now deliver 28% of 
revenue and we are well on track to achieve our 5 year goal of 30%. More guests are switching to our great value 
"plus" fares, reserved seating, priority boarding, and car hire. Ryanair Rooms penetration is rising steadily, albeit 
from a low base, as our guests recognise our unique combination of lowest hotel prices and travel credits.In the 
area of Customer Service, we have lowered our checked bag fees while increasing the bag allowance (to 20kg). 
Our amended 2 cabin bag policy (1 of which goes in the hold f.o.c. for non-priority guests) has improved boarding 
and punctuality, and we are expanding our offers in areas such as FastTrack, and ground transport connections. In 
March we launched our new environmental policy, which commits Ryanair to a series of industry leading 
environmental targets, including moving to "plastic free" within 5 years, while allowing our guests to contribute 
voluntarily to our carbon offset programme, the proceeds of which will be applied to support selected environmental 
projects.Over the last year our on-time performance has declined by 2% from 88% to 86%. All of this decline was 
accounted for by increased ATC delays due to strikes and staffing/capacity shortages mainly in France, Germany 
and Italy. The delivery of ATC services in Europe is lamentable and creating unacceptable delays for our 
customers. Punctuality in Q4 was negatively impacted by unusually adverse weather conditions, which led to 
multiple airport snow closures at key bases including Dublin and Stansted for a number of days in late 
February/early March. We are working hard to increase staffing at our larger bases, re-designing boarding 
procedures, and providing additional spare aircraft in S.18 to improve our punctuality to our 90% target, which is a 
key AGB target for the coming year.Costs:Ryanair enjoys a significant cost advantage over all other EU airlines, 
and we expect this leadership to continue. In FY18, unit costs helped by our fuel hedging fell 1%. Even as traffic 
grew 9%, ex-fuel unit costs rose 3% mainly due to one-off EU261 costs arising from our Sept. 2017 cancellations, 
and higher H2 staff costs as we agreed substantial pay increases and 5 year pay deals with our pilots and cabin 
crew. We expect the market for experienced pilots in Europe to remain tight for the next 12 months, and 
accordingly, this will continue to put upward pressure on staff costs for all EU airlines.In FY19 we will invest 
substantially in our people, our systems, and our business as we scale up the operation to take delivery of 210 
Boeing Gamechanger aircraft over the next 6 years. This will lead to a modest increase in ex-fuel unit costs next 
year but will underpin our growth to almost 600 aircraft and 200m guests p.a. by FY24. We expect staff costs to rise 
by almost 200m, half of which is higher pay for our front line people and half is additional headcount for growth.Fuel 
will be a major cost headwind for the next 24 months. We are currently 90% hedged for FY19 at approx. $58pbl, 
which is well below current spot prices of almost $80pbl. While US Shale production remains strong, world demand 
for oil is growing, and a number of short term political factors in Venezuela, Libya and Iran, suggests that prices will 
continue to be elevated for the coming year. Air fares tend to follow oil prices (as they have downwards over the last 
3 years) but with a lag of up to 12 months before higher oil prices feed through to higher air fares. Accordingly, we 
expect unit costs over the next year to rise by 9% (ex-fuel they will increase by 6%). Thereafter, we expect the 
impact of the lower seat cost Boeing 737-MAX aircraft, our new lower cost 10 year engine maintenance agreement, 
as well as airport growth opportunities and the disposal of older aircraft, to deliver flat or slightly declining non-fuel 
unit costs.Labour Cost:While we have made a promising start in negotiations with pilot unions, including signed 
recognition agreements with BALPA (UK) and ANPAC (Italy), we are also making considerable progress with our 
cabin crew negotiations, most notably in the UK and Spain. We suffered a 1 day pilot strike in Germany (Dec. 
2017), and 3 days of cabin crew strikes in Portugal (in March/April), but in all cases, the majority of our people 
continued to work normally so these strikes had minimal impact on our operations. Our combination of higher pay, 
improved rosters, and unmatched job security will, we believe, continue to make Ryanair an employer of choice in 
the EU airline sector. We're welcoming hundreds of new pilots and cabin crew to Ryanair this year, including many 
joiners from bankrupt airlines such as Monarch and Air Berlin among others. We will continue to deal openly and 
fairly with our people and their unions, but we will not make concessions on pay or productivity which threatens 
either our low cost model or our cost leadership in Europe.Consolidation:The industry in Europe continues to 
consolidate into 5 large airline groups. In the last year, Monarch went bust, Lufthansa acquired Air Berlin, and more 
recently IAG made an offer to acquire loss making Norwegian. During the period, Ryanair established a Polish 
charter airline, Ryanair Sun, which started flying in April and looks set to trade profitably in its first 12 months of 
operation. In April, we acquired 24.9% of LaudaMotion, and are working to increase that stake to 75% (subject to 
EU merger approval) so that we can work with Niki Lauda and his team to re-launch LaudaMotion as Austria's No.1 
low fares airline, serving markets from Austria and Germany to sun destinations primarily in Spain. LaudaMotion is 
an attractive opportunity as it is an Airbus operator, and we are looking for opportunities to grow its Airbus fleet to 
Ryanair reports 10% increase in full year profit after tax to 1.45bn
30-50 aircraft over the next 5 years. LaudaMotion has a valuable portfolio of slots at many congested airports in 
Germany, Vienna, and Palma de Mallorca. We believe that by investing in these separate airlines, we can build a 
substantial and profitable group of EU airlines under the Ryanair Holdings banner over the next 3 years, when it is 
likely that further M&A opportunities will arise. LaudaMotion will require almost 100m in start-up costs, and 
operating losses over the next 2 years in large measure due to expensive aircraft leases from Lufthansa. Once 
these leases expire, we expect LaudaMotion to be modestly profitable and self-sustaining as it grows its low fare 
offerings in Germany and Austria.Brexit:We remain concerned at the likely impact of a hard Brexit. While there is a 
general belief that an 18 month transition agreement from March 2019 to December 2020 will be implemented and 
further extended, it is in the best interest of our shareholders that we continue to plan for a hard Brexit in March 
2019. In these circumstances, it is likely that our UK shareholders will be treated as non-EU and this could 
potentially affect Ryanair's licencing and flight rights. Accordingly, in line with our Articles, we intend to restrict the 
voting rights of all non-EU shareholders in the event of a hard Brexit, so that we can ensure that Ryanair is majority 
owned and controlled by EU shareholders at all times to comply with our licences. This would result in non-EU 
shareholders not being able to vote on shareholder resolutions. In the meantime, we have applied for a UK AOC 
which we hope to receive before the end of 2018.

Ryanair has today reported that profits after tax rose 10% to €1.45 billion for its financial year to the end of March.
Today’s figures also show that despite last autumn’s flight cancellations, traffic grew 9% to over 130 million 
passengers, with the airline’s average fare falling 3% to €39.40
Although the airline has bought ahead 90% of its expected fuel needs for the current year, at $59 a barrel, the 
increase in oil prices is expected to add more than €400m to the airline’s fuel bill.
According to the results, non-fuel unit costs will rise by up to 6% due to increased staffing costs and business 
investment.The airline said it expects staff costs to rise by almost €200m, half of which will be accounted for by 
higher pay for front line people and half by additional headcount for growth.
Despite Ryanair’s profit increase and an expected increase of passenger traffic by 7% in financial year 2019, 
Michael O'Leary has said that the 2019 outlook is "on the pessimistic side of cautious".

Europe's largest budget airline Ryanair has reported improved profits in the 2017 fiscal year despite lower ticket 
prices and September's mismanagement of pilot schedules.
From April 2017 to March 2018, a 10-per-cent increase in after-tax profit to 1.45 billion euros (1.7 billion dollars) 
was reported by the Irish airline in a statement released on Monday.
"We are pleased to report a 10-per-cent increase in profits, with an unchanged net margin of 20 per cent," said 
CEO Michael O'Leary, who also acknowledged the difficulties of the September 2017 "rostering management 
failure."
Ryanair cancelled around 20,000 flights in the autumn after failing to accommodate for a backlog of holidays for its 
crew, which caused a number of strikes by employees across Europe.
Despite the crisis, the airline still logged over 130 million passengers in 2017, filling 95 per cent of their available 
seats, an industry high.
While O'Leary expects even more passengers in the coming year, he also warns of higher costs for pilots, crew and 
fuel.

RYANAIR'S Irish union is threatening a pilot strike if the company does not agree to new working practices by this 
Thursday.
In December last year the company had to cancel thousands of flights due to overbooking problems which cost it 
millions of pounds.
During the chaos, pilots used the situation to force the company to recognise unions for the first time in its 32-year 
existence.
According to Reuters, the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association wrote in a letter to chief executive of Ryanair Michael 
O'Leary its demands for new systems dealing with annual leave, promotions and base allocations.
"If it is not possible to renegotiate the introduction of such a seniority agreement for the benefit of our member pilots 
directly employed by Ryanair, it is our intention to ballot our member pilots employed by Ryanair for sanction of 
industrial action up to and including strike action," the letter, dated 17 May, said.

Coras, where investors include U2’s The Edge and a number of leading business people, is ramping up a lucrative 
partnership with Ryanair across Europe as it seeks to disrupt the stranglehold that players like Ticketmaster have 
on the market.
It has also set its sights on entering the US market in 2019 and has added investment.
It now has funding of €2.7 million, most recently adding almost three-quarters of a million euro from Elkstone, the 
wealth manager that looks after the money of model Elle MacPherson and venture capital investor Nicole 
Junkermann, and investment from Enterprise Ireland.
Adrian Turner, who formerly ran John and Bernie Gallagher’s Crownway Capital, has joined the board of Coras and 
helps advise on strategy. Coras runs Ryanair’s tickets page, where it sells tickets for West End shows such as the 
Lion King, or comedy gigs like Bill Bailey and music gigs like the Kaiser Chiefs.
[caption id="attachment_416968" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Mark McLaughlin of Coras[/caption]
Ryanair, which has a customer base of 129 million people, wants to ramp up both the variety of events it offers 
tickets for in theatre, music and sporting events across Europe and the markets it offers them in, so Coras is 
powering ahead with driving this.
Coras’s software sits behind companies’ websites and runs the ticket-buying technology for them - and co-founder 
Mark McLaughlin, a son of stockbroker Kyran McLaughlin, sees this way of buying tickets as the future.
“Consumers are moving towards a model where if they use a website for something they’ll buy tickets there as well. 
It’s a convenience thing - your credit card details are saved, it’s a lot more seamless. It’s a natural progression: 
you’re going somewhere, you book a flight, then you book a ticket for a show or a match or a tourist attraction.”
Ticket seller Coras seals Ryanair deal Edge-backed firm hits funding of €2.7m
Listed deals giant Priceline bought tours and attractions booker FareHarbor and Tripadvisor acquired a tours and 
activities tech provider called Bokun in April, while travel site Expedia is increasingly focusing on events and 
activities.
In Ryanair’s case it’s a major growth area.
“Ryanair is now one of the biggest e-commerce companies in Europe,” said McLaughlin. “Their ancillary revenue 
sales are something like €1.8 billion - it’s a big part of their business.”
It makes its money by taking a small percentage clip of each ticket that comes through the system and is building 
up its relationships with music promoters, top sports clubs and entertainment giants such as Kilimanjaro Live, one 
of the biggest music promoters in Britain and exhibition operator NEC.

Ryanair said its issues with pilot staffing have stabilised, with would-be Ryanair pilots queueing up to join after the 
company decided to recognise unions and offer direct contracts.
Along with direct employment contracts for new joiners, plus agreements to recognise unions in some 
countries, Ryanair has also dropped the cost of some training, known as a type rating, ordered more simulators and 
has 100 new training pilots.
"After Christmas, we will have the capacity to train the pilots right up to a fleet of 550 aircraft. We will have less than 
500 aircraft next year, so we're in good shape," Ryanair Chief Operations Officer Peter Bellew told Reuters on the 
sidelines of a CAPA-Centre for Aviation conference in Dublin.
"Because things have stabilised and calmed down, it seems as if people are queuing up to join us," he said, adding 
retention rates have improved. "But it will always be a challenge."
Ryanair now has union recognition contracts in Britain and Italy, but is still negotiating in Spain and Germany. 
Bellew said he hoped to come to an agreement in Spain over the next days and months, where a sticking point is 
days off for union work. Bellew said Ryanair thinks the 36 days asked for is excessive.
Bellew said there was an opportunity to open bases in France, where it is also holding talks with the main pilots' 
union, but that Ryanair didn't have enough aircraft to do so over the next 12-18 months.
"In 2020 we have more aircraft, maybe it will be then, maybe earlier," he said.
Ryanair COO says pilot staffing situation has stabilised
Asked about whether Ryanair would be interested in Norwegian Air Shuttle, which has rebuffed approaches from 
British Airways-owner IAG, Bellew said Ryanair had its hands full.
But he added that if IAG or Lufthansa ended up buying Norwegian and having to give up airport take off and landing 
slots then Ryanair would be interested in those.
Separately, chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said there was a real risk of flights being grounded in April 2019 
with a transition deal between Britain and the EU still not signed.
"How are people going to fly in April of 2019?" he said. "That reality is still a possibility because there's nothing 
signed yet." (Reuters)

Oil up, airline share prices down. Energy is a major cost for carriers. It should be that simple. It is not. Crude is more 
than $70 per barrel and jet fuel prices have jumped by a half over the past year. European airlines' shares are also 
up and have kept up with broader regional indices.
One of the best performers is easyJet. With labour issues behind it and newish chief executive Johan Lundgren 
front and centre, the low-cost carrier has taken advantage of rivals' woes. It should not become too comfortable. 
Shares look pricey.
First-half results were well received. Profits were as the market had expected. A healthy 10 per cent increase in 
revenues per seat coincided with good cost control. The collapse of Monarch Airlines late last year, as well as 
Ryanair's forced flight cancellations, made by far the biggest contribution to improved sales per seat.
EasyJet also raised its full-year forecast for profits before tax to at least £530m. That is almost a third higher than 
analysts had expected. The shares jumped 3 per cent.
That puts them at cruising altitude. At 16 times forward earnings, including upgrades to guidance, easyJet is not far 
from its five-year peak. This year it has the highest valuation of its European peers. Fuel hedging aside, cost control 
is no better than at Ryanair. Labour productivity is persistently lower at easyJet, says Bernstein. And capacity is 
rising, likely to be up 13 per cent year on year by September.
Yes, most of that is due to its purchase of slots at Berlin's Tegel airport, following the demise of Air Berlin last year. 
But easyJet remains one of the top contributors to the growth of seats in European short haul, after Ryanair and 
Lufthansa.
EasyJet : ich bin ein barnstormer Twitter : @FTLex Email: lex@ft.com
Mr Lundgren's big plan is to build up easyJet's holiday business. That comes as no shock, given his background in 
the travel business. Ancillary revenues may increase. It will not turn many heads in the City. Expect easyJet shares 
to depressurise this summer.

Tory party chaos may force government’s hand on border backstop
Tory party chaos may force government’s hand on border backstop

Highlight: With the civil war raging between Theresa May and her party’s extreme Brexiteers, the Irish government 
may have to force a confrontation on the border issue at the EU summit next month 
Body
When the British government was negotiating the departure of Ireland from the British Empire, they had a 
formidable team featuring prime minister Lloyd George and future prime minister Winston Churchill.
But now the British civil servants negotiating the exit from the EU next March have to deal with the political 
weakness of prime minister Theresa May and disloyal outbursts from foreign secretary Boris Johnson.
It means the Irish government’s key aim of avoiding a hard border is now in real peril due to the civil war within the 
Tory party.
As it stands, there is also nothing to stop Ryanair going ahead with its plans to put a warning on tickets for flights 
from Britain that they may not be able to operate after Brexit.
So all eyes are turning to the EU summit in June, now seen as the last chance to sign up to a withdrawal treaty 
which avoids a return of the hard border that began in 1921.
]]]
The spectre of Brexit is one of the reasons the Irish government has been staging its Future of Europe roadshow 
around the country since January. The other, of course, is that it’s a way of currying favour with French president 
Emmanuel Macron, who came up with the idea.
European Movement Ireland’s executive director Noelle O’Connell said that Brexit had not come up during sessions 
in Galway, Cork, Limerick, Maynooth, Letterkenny and Navan “as much as you’d expect’. But she said it was having 
a psychological impact on young people in particular who did not know what difference it would make to their lives.
Tory party chaos may force government’s hand on border backstop
“It is hanging over people like the Sword of Damocles. It is causing people great uncertainty and great concern,” 
she said.
The final Future of Europe event took place last week in the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham in Dublin, a historic 
location that took in army pensioners after the Battle of the Boyne. It served as Garda headquarters in the 1930s, 
but fell into disrepair before being turned into the Irish Museum of Modern Art in the 1980s.
Helen McEntee, Minister of State for European Affairs, brought up its colourful history to argue that the European 
Union too needed “a refurbishment and a bit of retro-fitting” after 60 years in operation. She made the case for 
admitting more new members such as Serbia and Montenegro, saying that people here wanted others to get the 
same benefits of EU membership that we had (€42 billion in net transfers since joining in 1973).
But the message for the departing British was the same. McEntee told this newspaper that the government was 
focused on getting the British government’s commitment to avoid a hard border into legally binding text in the EU 
withdrawal agreement.
“Our approach is not going to change. The backstop is there because of the EU red lines. It has not created the red 
lines. We have to be able to work around that and find the solution to it. That is something the UK have to come to 
the table with,” she said.
So far, the Irish government has been giving the British government time to resolve its own internal divisions before 
putting the foot down on the backstop – the guarantee that there will be no physical infrastructure, checks or 
controls at the border between the North and the Republic post Brexit.
John O’Brennan, who is professor of European integration at Maynooth University, said that there had been clear 
warnings from Tánaiste Simon Coveney that the British government had to deliver on these promises at the EU 
summit in June.
“They are saying our vital national interests here are paramount and if necessary they will force a confrontation on 
this in June. All Simon was doing was re-stating what the government has said again and again. It’s not the 
government throwing the toys out of the pram. It’s this real determination to protect Irish interests,” he said.
So how does the government force such a confrontation? It is by getting the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and 
all the other 26 EU member states to agree to suspend the talks on the withdrawal agreement. That would be a 
high-stakes move, which could lead to the fall of Theresa May’s government. If that happens, Varadkar should 
brace himself for the type of full-on onslaught from the Eurosceptic wing of the British press which they usually 
reserve for England managers or penalty shoot-out takers who have failed in a World Cup.
But if the government does not push its case in Brussels at the summit on June 28 and 29, then it is all down to the 
final EU summit in October. A deal has to be done there in order to be ratified by both the European Parliament and 
the British parliament before the March exit date. Or else it will be the dreaded hard Brexit, with not even a two-year 
transition deal to cushion the blow.
O’Brennan said he agreed with former taoiseach Bertie Ahern that it would be a mistake to wait until the final 
summit in October. “From the Irish point of view, it’s preferable that if there’s going to be a confrontation, it’s sooner 
rather than later,” he said.
That is why there has been a continuous round of diplomatic engagement to ensure that our EU allies are willing to 
threaten the British with a talks shut-down. The latest on the schedule is Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s stop-off visit to 
Romanian president Klaus Iohannis this week before he meets May and other EU leaders at another EU meeting in 
Bulgaria.
Fine Gael Senator Neale Richmond, who is a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, said the 
maintenance of support for the Irish position was the “biggest achievement going”.
Tory party chaos may force government’s hand on border backstop
“Who would have thought we would have seen no division among the EU 27? It shows the European side is so 
solid. They do hold all the aces in negotiating terms and this is something the British people are only starting to 
realise in the last couple of weeks. They are not negotiating from a position of strength,” he said.
In private, the negotiations between Barnier’s team and the British side led by Olly Robbins have managed to 
achieve significant progress amid all the chaos.
About 75 per cent of the withdrawal agreement has been locked down. But the remaining 25 per cent is up in the air 
because the British cabinet cannot agree on what it wants.
The Irish Congress of Trade Unions’ general secretary Patricia King said that the job of the British negotiators was 
being made very difficult by the hard Brexiteers in the Conservative Party who were undermining Theresa May.
“What we’re seeing here is a group within the Conservative Party who seem to be hell bent on one mission which is 
Brexit, out of the EU in all its forms. They are of a view that they will not be stopped. And no agreement, whether it’s 
the Good Friday Agreement or any other, will get in their way,” she said.
As an experienced trade union negotiator, one of the starting points for King always was to know exactly what she 
was looking for. She said there had been “striking clarity” from the Irish government and the EU negotiators, but not 
from the British government.
“If you are in there, and your backdrop is that you have people fundamentally in disagreement with what you as a 
negotiator want, that leads to all sorts of confused, bad outcomes,” she said.
]]]
Part of the government’s job is to keep a united front at home by convincing key domestic audiences that it is 
pursuing the right Brexit strategy.
Every few months, Simon Coveney gives an 8am briefing to the Brexit stakeholders’ forum in the Department of 
Foreign Affairs headquarters in Iveagh House. The early start time was chosen to avoid clashing with the work 
schedules of the business leaders, trade unionists, academics and opposition politicians who are on it.
But even though Fianna Fáil has been on the forum, its criticisms have grown louder over recent months.
Fianna Fáil’s new Brexit spokeswoman Lisa Chambers said she had concerns that the ‘bulletproof’ and ‘cast iron’ 
guarantees that Varadkar had spoken about after last December’s EU summit had still not been delivered in the text 
of the withdrawal agreement.
“I think the government was premature in announcing the backstop. I do think there was a detrimental effect of 
patting ourselves too much on the back when it hadn’t been achieved,” she said.
Chambers said the premature announcements about the guarantee of no hard border had lulled Irish businesses 
into a false sense of security.
“AIB says that only 6 per cent of SMEs have a Brexit plan,” she said.
There is a school of thought that Fianna Fáil’s criticism of the government’s record on Brexit is a way for it to keep 
its options open for a general election this year. But Chambers said she and her party were “always” acting in the 
country’s best interests.
“This is too important. We have no interest in using Brexit for any bad means. Our approach will always be 
constructive,” she said.
Chambers and her party have been calling on Vardakar and Coveney to spell out what they mean when they 
demand “significant progress” on the Brexit withdrawal treaty at the June summit. There has been no clear answer 
Tory party chaos may force government’s hand on border backstop
yet. Much depends on the meeting of the British government’s Brexit cabinet sub-committee next week to see if 
Theresa May can get agreement on Britain staying in some form of customs’ union – which would avoid a hard 
border.
Fine Gael MEP Brian Hayes said he believed that the “Mexican-stand off” could be ended.
“I still think there are a lot of opportunities for a deal. Barnier wants a deal, Europe wants a deal, we need a deal. 
Theresa May wants to do a deal. That’s her legacy,” he said.
But one former European Commission staffer wryly told me last week that the British cabinet was like a flock of 
sheep running back and over in the field – with only a little gap in the wall to go through.
The logical position is for them to eventually run through the gap, led by their shepherd, Theresa May. But as US 
president Donald Trump has shown with his crazy move to pull out of the nuclear arms control deal with Iran, logic 
doesn’t always come into it.

China woos pilots in war for aviation talent; Country's airlines snap up 
foreign flight schools and raise pay as global sector struggles to meet 
demand for air travel

Chinese airlines are buying foreign flying schools and poaching pilots, amplifying a talent shortage that has affected 
airlines in other regions.
"The growth in Chinese aviation is unprecedented in our lifetimes and probably in history," said Paul Jebely, a 
Hong-Kong-based lawyer specialising in aviation. "There have been more aircraft ordered than there are pilots to fly 
them. "
The squeeze on flying talent has triggered flight cancellations, dented profits and threatened the industry's 
ambitious growth targets around the world.
Emirates is the latest major airline to feel the impact of a war for aviation talent, with the Middle Eastern carrier 
cancelling flights and grounding aircraft this month owing to a shortage of about 125 pilots.
"We're a tad short of pilots," Tim Clark, Emirates chief executive, said last month in a moment of understatement, 
adding that Chinese carriers were offering extremely competitive packages to pilots to move to Shanghai or Beijing.
China woos pilots in war for aviation talent; Country's airlines snap up foreign flight schools and raise pay as 
global sector struggles to meet demand for air ....
In September Ryanair axed 20,000 flights owing to a rostering mess-up made worse by pilot shortages. This forced 
the low-cost carrier to reverse a longstanding policy and recognise trade unions and agree new pay deals - a move 
that it said would cost it (EURO)100m a year from 2019.
Experts say the pilot shortage has been prompted by surging demand for air travel fuelled by the rise of low-cost 
carriers in recent decades.
Some say this has gone hand-in-hand with a lowering in the status and pay of pilots, in comparison to other 
industries, and the rising cost of flight training in western nations, which is putting off new recruits.
China is on course to overtake the US as the world's largest air-travel market by 2022, according to the 
International Air Transport Association.
US aircraft maker Boeing predicts that China will need 110,000 new pilots in the years to 2035, and its airlines are 
expected to purchase 7,000 commercial aircraft over the next two decades.
China's aviation market grew by 13 per cent last year, with 549m passengers taking to the skies, double the 
number who flew in 2010. Growth is being driven by the rising middle class, an expansion of routes by Chinese 
airlines and the easing of visa restrictions by foreign governments keen to attract Chinese tourists.
The number of pilots and co-pilots working in China almost doubled between 2011 and 2017. Over recent months 
China's main airlines - China Eastern, Air China, China Southern and Hainan Airlines - have stepped up recruitment 
and are expanding their offshore training.
"Chinese airlines have raised pay dra-matically," said Dave Ross, the president of Wasinc International, which 
helps Chinese airlines find foreign pilots. Mr Ross said pilots from Central or Latin America, and some places in 
Europe could quadruple their pay in China.
The starting salary offered to foreign pilots in China has jumped over the past 10 years from $10,000 per month to 
$26,000 per month, tax free, and was still rising, he said.
"Some Chinese airlines are offering tax-free salary packages, which can be up to twice what western airlines offer," 
said Murray Butt, president of the Australian and International Pilots Association.
India's surging air travel - where passenger numbers have been growing by an average of about 16 per cent a year 
since the beginning of the millennium - adds more pressure to the global pilot shortage. Having seen rapid growth in 
passengers over the past few years, Indian airlines have been recruiting from the military, from abroad and from 
competitors by offering increasingly lucrative contracts. They have also made it more difficult for pilots to leave, 
forcing commanding officers to give a year's notice if they wish to leave.
"Airlines have been poaching each other's pilots, and this move was meant to stop some of that," said one pilot, 
referring to the one-year notice period. "But as far as the pilots are concerned, it is outrageous."
Chinese airlines pay the tuition of cadet pilots and are intensifying efforts to develop more local talent. But there are 
only 22 pilot schools in China and restrictions on the use of domestic airspace mean they are increasingly looking 
overseas to partner with foreign flight schools.
Almost half of China's 5,053 trainee pilots last year were trained abroad, creating a flourishing business for flight 
schools and their owners in the US, Canada and Australia.
"Chinese companies have been on a buying spree of foreign flight schools from Australia to the US and the 
Philippines to Canada," said Mr Jebely. "There are many very happy flight school owners who have cashed out, 
with some significant premiums paid." The gleaming new offices and recently purchased Cessna aircraft at CAE 
Oxford's flight school at Moorabbin airport in Melbourne highlights how Chinese cash is transforming the 
flightschool industry in Australia. "About half our students are Chinese students at the moment - it means we can 
China woos pilots in war for aviation talent; Country's airlines snap up foreign flight schools and raise pay as 
global sector struggles to meet demand for air ....
invest in aircraft and facilities that you see here," said Mike Drinkall, general manager of CAE Oxford, which 
operates more than 50 schools globally.
China Eastern bought half of CAE's Australian subsidiary in 2014. It is training 150 pilots at the centre this year and 
plans to double that number following a $50m investment in facilities, now under construction.
The influx of Chinese trainees into Australian flight schools has coincided with a 25 per cent drop in the number of 
local trainees receiving commercial pilots' licences - prompting concern among the country's airlines.
"There is a shortage of pilots everywhere. We are lucky because we are at the top of the food chain," said Alan 
Joyce, Qantas chief executive.
"But what we are worried about is that we are taking pilots from the military and general aviation, and we can't keep 
doing that or the ecosystem won't survive."
Qantas says it will open the biggest flight school in Australia next year and train up to 500 pilots a year. The school 
will train Australians but also foreign candidates - including Chinese - as the airline seeks to capitalise on the 
fastestgrowing aviation market in the world. "Given our brand name this could be a good business in its own right," 
said Mr Joyce.
Additional reporting by Nicolle Liu in Hong Kong and Kiran Stacey in New Delhi Overseas training Cadet army sent 
abroad to gain wings Bo Song is one of the army of 2,500 trainee pilots sent overseas every year by Chinese 
airlines to meet rocketing demand for pilots.
The 22-year-old from China's Shandong province is studying at CAE Oxford's Melbourne flight school, which is 
home to 150 China Eastern cadets.
"You know in China we need more and more pilots but we don't have enough airspace or flight schools. So we 
need to come here," he said.
Mr Song is training for a commercial pilot's licence issued by Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority. He will 
spend 20 months in Australia and fly between 200 and 250 hours, as well as taking English lessons.
"English is really important. We have to communicate with our instructors and communicate with the tower," he 
said.
Some of the students undertake extra high-performance training when they have completed their commercial 
licence. If successful, the cadets will graduate and join China Eastern - one of the country's biggest carriers.
"I think every pilot wants to be captain. Maybe when I finish my training I will fly the big jets. That would be 
amazing," said Mr Song.
Asked the difference between his hometown in China and Melbourne, he replied: "Life here is very comfortable. In 
fact the biggest difference is the weather and the atmosphere.
"In China the air is polluted, whereas in Melbourne the beautiful weather and fresh air is amazing."

China woos pilots in war for aviation talent; Country's airlines snap up

Chinese airlines are buying foreign flying schools and poaching pilots, amplifying a talent shortage that has affected 
airlines in other regions.
"The growth in Chinese aviation is unprecedented in our lifetimes and probably in history," said Paul Jebely, a 
Hong-Kong-based lawyer specialising in aviation. "There have been more aircraft ordered than there are pilots to fly 
them. "
The squeeze on flying talent has triggered flight cancellations, dented profits and threatened the industry's 
ambitious growth targets around the world.
Emirates is the latest major airline to feel the impact of a war for aviation talent, with the Middle Eastern carrier 
cancelling flights and grounding aircraft this month owing to a shortage of about 125 pilots.
"We're a tad short of pilots," Tim Clark, Emirates chief executive, said last month in a moment of understatement, 
adding that Chinese carriers were offering extremely competitive packages to pilots to move to Shanghai or Beijing.

In September Ryanair axed 20,000 flights owing to a rostering mess-up made worse by pilot shortages. This forced 
the low-cost carrier to reverse a longstanding policy and recognise trade unions and agree new pay deals - a move 
that it said would cost it (EURO)100m a year from 2019.
Experts say the pilot shortage has been prompted by surging demand for air travel fuelled by the rise of low-cost 
carriers in recent decades.
Some say this has gone hand-in-hand with a lowering in the status and pay of pilots, in comparison to other 
industries, and the rising cost of flight training in western nations, which is putting off new recruits.
China is on course to overtake the US as the world's largest air-travel market by 2022, according to the 
International Air Transport Association.
US aircraft maker Boeing predicts that China will need 110,000 new pilots in the years to 2035, and its airlines are 
expected to purchase 7,000 commercial aircraft over the next two decades.
China's aviation market grew by 13 per cent last year, with 549m passengers taking to the skies, double the 
number who flew in 2010. Growth is being driven by the rising middle class, an expansion of routes by Chinese 
airlines and the easing of visa restrictions by foreign governments keen to attract Chinese tourists.
The number of pilots and co-pilots working in China almost doubled between 2011 and 2017. Over recent months 
China's main airlines - China Eastern, Air China, China Southern and Hainan Airlines - have stepped up recruitment 
and are expanding their offshore training.
"Chinese airlines have raised pay dra-matically," said Dave Ross, the president of Wasinc International, which 
helps Chinese airlines find foreign pilots. Mr Ross said pilots from Central or Latin America, and some places in 
Europe could quadruple their pay in China.
The starting salary offered to foreign pilots in China has jumped over the past 10 years from $10,000 per month to 
$26,000 per month, tax free, and was still rising, he said.
"Some Chinese airlines are offering tax-free salary packages, which can be up to twice what western airlines offer," 
said Murray Butt, president of the Australian and International Pilots Association.
India's surging air travel - where passenger numbers have been growing by an average of about 16 per cent a year 
since the beginning of the millennium - adds more pressure to the global pilot shortage. Having seen rapid growth in 
passengers over the past few years, Indian airlines have been recruiting from the military, from abroad and from 
competitors by offering increasingly lucrative contracts. They have also made it more difficult for pilots to leave, 
forcing commanding officers to give a year's notice if they wish to leave.
"Airlines have been poaching each other's pilots, and this move was meant to stop some of that," said one pilot, 
referring to the one-year notice period. "But as far as the pilots are concerned, it is outrageous."
Chinese airlines pay the tuition of cadet pilots and are intensifying efforts to develop more local talent. But there are 
only 22 pilot schools in China and restrictions on the use of domestic airspace mean they are increasingly looking 
overseas to partner with foreign flight schools.
Almost half of China's 5,053 trainee pilots last year were trained abroad, creating a flourishing business for flight 
schools and their owners in the US, Canada and Australia.
"Chinese companies have been on a buying spree of foreign flight schools from Australia to the US and the 
Philippines to Canada," said Mr Jebely. "There are many very happy flight school owners who have cashed out, 
with some significant premiums paid." The gleaming new offices and recently purchased Cessna aircraft at CAE 
Oxford's flight school at Moorabbin airport in Melbourne highlights how Chinese cash is transforming the 
flightschool industry in Australia. "About half our students are Chinese students at the moment - it means we can 
China woos pilots in war for aviation talent Country's airlines snap up foreign flight schools and raise pay as 
global sector struggles to meet demand for air t....
invest in aircraft and facilities that you see here," said Mike Drinkall, general manager of CAE Oxford, which 
operates more than 50 schools globally.
China Eastern bought half of CAE's Australian subsidiary in 2014. It is training 150 pilots at the centre this year and 
plans to double that number following a $50m investment in facilities, now under construction.
The influx of Chinese trainees into Australian flight schools has coincided with a 25 per cent drop in the number of 
local trainees receiving commercial pilots' licences - prompting concern among the country's airlines.
"There is a shortage of pilots everywhere.
We are lucky because we are at the top of the food chain," said Alan Joyce, Qantas chief executive.
"But what we are worried about is that we are taking pilots from the military and general aviation, and we can't keep 
doing that or the ecosystem won't survive."

China is on course to overtake the US as the world's largest air-travel market by 2022, according to the 
International Air Transport Association.
US aircraft maker Boeing predicts that China will need 110,000 new pilots in the years to 2035, and its airlines are 
expected to purchase 7,000 commercial aircraft over the next two decades.
China's aviation market grew by 13 per cent last year, with 549m passengers taking to the skies, double the 
number who flew in 2010. Growth is being driven by the rising middle class, an expansion of routes by Chinese 
airlines and the easing of visa restrictions by foreign governments keen to attract Chinese tourists.
The number of pilots and co-pilots working in China almost doubled between 2011 and 2017. Over recent months 
China's main airlines - China Eastern, Air China, China Southern and Hainan Airlines - have stepped up recruitment 
and are expanding their offshore training.
"Chinese airlines have raised pay dra-matically," said Dave Ross, the president of Wasinc International, which 
helps Chinese airlines find foreign pilots. Mr Ross said pilots from Central or Latin America, and some places in 
Europe could quadruple their pay in China.
The starting salary offered to foreign pilots in China has jumped over the past 10 years from $10,000 per month to 
$26,000 per month, tax free, and was still rising, he said.
"Some Chinese airlines are offering tax-free salary packages, which can be up to twice what western airlines offer," 
said Murray Butt, president of the Australian and International Pilots Association.
India's surging air travel - where passenger numbers have been growing by an average of about 16 per cent a year 
since the beginning of the millennium - adds more pressure to the global pilot shortage. Having seen rapid growth in 
passengers over the past few years, Indian airlines have been recruiting from the military, from abroad and from 
competitors by offering increasingly lucrative contracts. They have also made it more difficult for pilots to leave, 
forcing commanding officers to give a year's notice if they wish to leave.
"Airlines have been poaching each other's pilots, and this move was meant to stop some of that," said one pilot, 
referring to the one-year notice period. "But as far as the pilots are concerned, it is outrageous."
Chinese airlines pay the tuition of cadet pilots and are intensifying efforts to develop more local talent. But there are 
only 22 pilot schools in China and restrictions on the use of domestic airspace mean they are increasingly looking 
overseas to partner with foreign flight schools.
Almost half of China's 5,053 trainee pilots last year were trained abroad, creating a flourishing business for flight 
schools and their owners in the US, Canada and Australia.
"Chinese companies have been on a buying spree of foreign flight schools from Australia to the US and the 
Philippines to Canada," said Mr Jebely. "There are many very happy flight school owners who have cashed out, 
with some significant premiums paid." The gleaming new offices and recently purchased Cessna aircraft at CAE 
Oxford's flight school at Moorabbin airport in Melbourne highlights how Chinese cash is transforming the 
flightschool industry in Australia. "About half our students are Chinese students at the moment - it means we can 
China woos pilots in war for aviation talent; Country's airlines snap up foreign flight schools and raise pay as 
global sector struggles to meet demand for air ....
invest in aircraft and facilities that you see here," said Mike Drinkall, general manager of CAE Oxford, which 
operates more than 50 schools globally.
China Eastern bought half of CAE's Australian subsidiary in 2014. It is training 150 pilots at the centre this year and 
plans to double that number following a $50m investment in facilities, now under construction.
The influx of Chinese trainees into Australian flight schools has coincided with a 25 per cent drop in the number of 
local trainees receiving commercial pilots' licences - prompting concern among the country's airlines.
"There is a shortage of pilots everywhere. We are lucky because we are at the top of the food chain," said Alan 
Joyce, Qantas chief executive.
"But what we are worried about is that we are taking pilots from the military and general aviation, and we can't keep 
doing that or the ecosystem won't survive."
Qantas says it will open the biggest flight school in Australia next year and train up to 500 pilots a year. The school 
will train Australians but also foreign candidates - including Chinese - as the airline seeks to capitalise on the 
fastestgrowing aviation market in the world.
"Given our brand name this could be a good business in its own right," said Mr Joyce.
Additional reporting by Nicolle Liu in Hong Kong and Kiran Stacey in New Delhi Overseas training Cadet army sent 
abroad to gain wings Bo Song is one of the army of 2,500 trainee pilots sent overseas every year by Chinese 
airlines to meet rocketing demand for pilots.
The 22-year-old from China's Shandong province is studying at CAE Oxford's Melbourne flight school, which is 
home to 150 China Eastern cadets.
"You know in China we need more and more pilots but we don't have enough airspace or flight schools. So we 
need to come here," he said.
Mr Song is training for a commercial pilot's licence issued by Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority. He will 
spend 20 months in Australia and fly between 200 and 250 hours, as well as taking English lessons.
"English is really important. We have to communicate with our instructors and communicate with the tower," he 
said.
Some of the students undertake extra high-performance training when they have completed their commercial 
licence. If successful, the cadets will graduate and join China Eastern - one of the country's biggest carriers.
"I think every pilot wants to be captain. Maybe when I finish my training I will fly the big jets. That would be 
amazing," said Mr Song.
Asked the difference between his hometown in China and Melbourne, he replied: "Life here is very comfortable. In 
fact the biggest difference is the weather and the atmosphere.
"In China the air is polluted, whereas in Melbourne the beautiful weather and fresh air is amazing."

Spanish pilots' union breaks off talks with Ryanair
Spanish pilots' union breaks off talks with Ryanair

Spanish pilots' union SEPLA has broken off talks with Ryanair over a union recognition agreement and says it plans 
to file a lawsuit against the airline over contracts in Spain.
Ryanair decided in December to recognise unions for the first time and while it has come to agreements in Britain 
and Italy, it is still working towards deals with unions in other major centres such as Ireland and Spain.
"We regret to inform you that, at today's meeting, the negotiations with Ryanair's management have been broken 
off as they have not accepted our minimum requirements document, 90% of which corresponded to their 
proposals," SEPLA said in a newsletter to members.
SEPLA, which says it represents around 500 of 800 Ryanair pilots based in Spain, said Ryanair did not want to 
allow union members three days a month to carry out union duties.
It had previously threatened legal action but suspended it to carry out talks with Ryanair.
Ryanair declined to comment.
In a memo from April 19 and reviewed by Reuters, Ryanair had said the remaining issue was time off duties for the 
pilots committee but that there appeared to be little between the two sides and so it was hopeful of an early 
conclusion.
Separately, Ryanair's newly-formed transnational pilot group held its first meeting and gave pilots a list of items to 
negotiate with Ryanair to ensure fair working conditions, such as base transfer protocols.

"These are actually very reasonable requests to allow fair working conditions and to solve Ryanair's pilot retention 
issues," Dirk Polloczek, president of the European Cockpit Association said on Twitter.
"We can now hope that this constructive attitude will be matched by Ryanair management in their talks with the 
national pilot unions." (Reuters)

UK investigators have determined that a Boeing 737-800 captain's heavy-handed manual response to a developing 
overspeed resulted in a serious injury to one of the flight attendants.
The inquiry into the upset on the Ryanair jet (EI-EBW), which had been descending towards Manchester on 14 
January last year, found that the captain had been startled by a sudden increase in airspeed towards the maximum 
operating Mach limit.
Air Accidents Investigation Branch analysis revealed that the 737 had started a descent from 40,000ft having been 
cleared to 20,000ft. Air traffic control had requested that, upon speed conversion, that the crew fly at 270kt rather 
than the carrier's standard 245kt.
The 737 began to descend while travelling at M0.77-0.78 but, owing to a strong Jetstream, the wind speed 
increased rapidly and – during descent through 36,700ft – the aircraft's airspeed rose to a maximum of M0.818.
While the autopilot was engaged, the captain felt that it was not correcting the overspeed.
"Thinking that he had little time to react, he simultaneously pressed the autopilot disengage button on his control 
wheel and pulled back on the control column," says the inquiry. "His intention was to avoid the overspeed as 
smoothly as possible using manual control inputs."
But flight-data recordings showed that the captain quickly exerted a 42.7lb (190N) force on the control column. 
Although the inquiry could not determine whether the autopilot disengaged as a result of the button-press or the 
column input, it says that the force applied was twice that required for autopilot disconnection.
Sharp manual overspeed correction injured 737's cabin crew E UK investigators have determined that a Boeing 
737-800 captain's heavy-handed manual response to a ....
"At the time [the captain] believed he was managing the manoeuvre gently," it states. "But with hindsight he 
suspected that startle effect caused him to exert more force on the control column than intended."
The abrupt manoeuvring caused two cabin crew members to lose their balance and one suffered a broken ankle.
Investigators point out that the lower air density at higher altitudes reduces the operating envelope, and that manual 
flying in such conditions demands particularly careful handling and the avoidance of large control movements.
Boeing's training manual states that changes in wind speed could lead to overspeed. While the autothrottle is able 
to provide "aggressive" speed control near operating limits, the manual says short-term overspeed can 
nevertheless occur under certain conditions.
It advises crews, in such cases, to deploy partial speedbrakes slowly until a noticeable reduction in airspeed in 
achieved, and retract them equally slowly once the airspeed falls below the operating limits.
Both pilots subsequently completed a recurrent simulator session which focused on overspeed recovery. Ryanair 
says it "accepts the findings" of the inquiry, and points out that there were "no safety actions or instructions issued 
to Ryanair as a result of the report”.
Investigators have highlighted a similar event, two months after the Ryanair incident, which involved a Qantas 737-
800 that experienced increasing headwinds during descent towards Canberra on 13 March last year. The crew 
used manual input to avoid overspeed, and two cabin crew members were injured.

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - U.K. shares rose notably on Wednesday as rallying oil prices

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) said it has smashed 1 billion platform visits per 
year - in the period from April 2017 to March 2018 - for the first time in its history.   The company noted that the new 
1 billion visitor record - website and app combined, is more visits than Lufthansa, British Airways, Air France, KLM 
and Iberia combined.  The figures have been independently verified by SimilarWeb, according to Ryanair. The 
company's platforms received six times the visits of football club site Man United. The company's platforms 
recorded 22 visits per second.  The most visits in order of markets are the UK, followed by Italy in second position 
and Spain in third position, Germany and Ireland ranked fourth and fifth, respectively.  'We are delighted to reach 
this milestone of 1 billion visits in a year, the equivalent of nearly every man, woman and child in Europe and the 
USA visiting Ryanair's platforms, as consumers demonstrate they know exactly where to go for the lowest fares in 
Europe,' Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said.   Further, Ryanair said it is celebrating its one billion visits with a 'Thanks a 
Billion' flash sale, with seats on the Ryanair.com website and app available from just 19.99 pounds, which must be 
booked before midnight on Friday, 11 May.

take-off - we're preparing your filet mignon just the way you like it. I'd like to apologise for the slight delay to your

Writing in a blog in 2015, Mark Ross-Smith, who now works at Malaysia Airlines, said an airline could record details 
including how many times a customer researched a flight on its website before booking, whether their cursor 
hovered over upgrade options, and whether they booked using their usual payment method, down to the bank.
Airlines are hoping big data might prove one antidote to the pressures of tight margins and intense competition.
"We really need to put our data to work," said a spokesperson at International Airlines Group, parent of airlines 
including British Airways and Iberia, to "support our airlines' brand, customer loyalty and profitability".
Earlier this year American Airlines rolled out its iSolve app for flight attendants. This allows them to offer "a gesture 
of goodwill, usually [air] miles, when the in-flight entertainment system does not work, for example, instead of 
saying, 'Contact customer relations when you land.'" A company spokesperson said: "Our goal is to improve the 
customer experience, particularly when things don't go as planned, to make it a little bit less painful for them."
Flight attendants on United Airlines also have handheld devices that give them access to customer details such as 
when they last flew with the airline, if they have a tight connection, and if they have dietary requirements. Like 
American, United also offers customers a bagtracking service to alert them if their luggage is lost or delayed.
Ryanair has a broader vision, and has said it aims to be the "Amazon for travel", using customer data to cross-sell 
extras, such as hotel rooms, on a onestop-shop platform.
All customers can sign up for a MyRyanair account, which saves personal preferences and allows the company to 
offer "targeted products and services," said Kenny Jacobs, chief marketing officer. "If a customer is travelling to 
Alicante with two children, we can offer them a five-seat car for hire."
Delta, a self-styled "data-driven" airline, has started asking flight attendants to interact with five passengers, who at 
the moment must be members of their loyalty programme, on every domestic flight. "You want to feel valued," said 
Allison Ausband, senior vice-president of in-flight service. "We are getting thank-you notes from customers for 
acknowledging them on the aeroplane ... Whether apologising for delays or acknowledging their [loyalty 
programme] status, we make them feel that they are that valued customer."
On a flight last year, the Delta team alerted their control centre when a passenger who was flying to an interview 
spilled a drink on himself. The airline then provided a clean shirt at arrivals.
Delta said it did not plan to increase staffing - automation and digital improvements had sped up check-in.
Gerrit Loots, from consultancy Alix-Partners, questioned to what extent personalisation would drive customer 
retention. "Data exploitation is not really a competitive differentiator," he said. "To be a top-tier airline these days, 
you have to have these things."
Another question is how far personalisation should go, and at what point data collection strays into invasion of 
privacy. If Mr Smith has ordered a gin and tonic on his previous five flights, should a flight attendant offer him one 
on his next, before he asks? Delta said predictive service was coming soon, though other airlines said they had yet 
to launch into the area.
Troves of data pose cyber security risks. According to Kevin O'Sullivan, lead engineer at research group SITA Lab, 
several of the biggest airlines and airports were "waking up to the liability of sitting on big data". Some IT 
departments, he said, "want to get away" from storing more arbitrary personal data, such as drink preferences, 
which benefit marketing but generate risk.
But Mr O'Sullivan said the broader use of technology had enormous potential.
SITA has completed a six-month trial of blockchain technology with BA and Heathrow and Miami airports, which 
focused on flight status information, where there was often no single data set or "version of the truth". If all relevant 
airlines and airports worked from a single data set on the blockchain, he said, the problem would be solved.
Airlines seek to lift profit margins with big data Trove of passenger information brings opportunity to personalise 
services, but there are privacy and security....
Blockchain technology might have other uses, such as helping streamline supply chains and making them more 
transparent. IAG said blockchain was a "key priority", while Lufthansa had started a "blockchain for aviation" 
initiative. IAG has launched a tech accelerator for aviation-linked start-ups.
One such group, Migacore, aims to use big data gathered by airlines, combined with data from other sources 
including news outlets and social media, which the group stressed was public content only, to project customer 
demand for specific flights on specific days.
"Airlines can't price dynamically without a good forecasting system," said Migacore founder Abheer Kolhatkar. Soon 
seat prices would be updated continually, in real time.
According to Marko Javornik of Comtrade Digital Services, airlines' forays into tech indicated that they were starting 
to understand that "significantly higher profits lie in monetising digital assets", rather than simply seats on planes. 
"Mobile apps are just a first stage of transformation."

"Good afternoon, Mr Smith, and congratulations on reaching 500,000 air miles. Lunch will be served an hour after 
take-off - we're preparing your filet mignon just the way you like it. I'd like to apologise for the slight delay to your 
flight to Miami last week, and let you know we're scheduled to arrive on time today."
Mr Smith no longer needs to be sitting in first class, wearing a Rolex and flashing a gold Amex to qualify for this sort 
of treatment. Airlines are seeking to harness big data to personalise customer experiences for as many travellers as 
possible - and they have a lot of data.
"We need to be operating at the level of Google," said Joe Leader, chief executive of the Airline Passenger 
Experience Association, in a report ahead of this year's Aviation Festival. "For every passenger, we know every 
detail that serves as a marketing treasure trove of personalisation. We have full names, address, exact birthdays, 
seat assignments, credit cards, and everything that should make personalisation easy."

The rapid growth in air traffic across western Europe is increasing capacity pressure on infrastructure, creating 
expectations that the region risks reaching bursting point in a few years.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary recently said, for example, that the Irish carrier was being hamstrung in its 
efforts to boost services in Germany by the “huge pressure” on airport capacity at peak times. He also accused 
Lufthansa Group airlines of “bed-blocking” slots at attractive times during the daily cycle.
Piecemeal solutions to capacity constraints have relieved the situation to an extent, but projects that would make a 
significant difference – specifically new airports and expansion works – are tending to expose the glacial pace of 
government and regulator action. In some cases, this means new facilities are in danger of being insufficient before 
they even open.
Further complicating the picture are the intransigent agendas of entrenched network carriers versus other operators 
as they grapple over who gets the rights to the best slots.
Stakeholders are also having to plan infrastructure at a time when governments and regulators are more mindful 
than ever about the environmental impact of aviation, leading to the imposition of restrictions on available slots and 
night flying, for example.
While such headaches are not unique to Europe, figures from IATA, released in February, show the region 
accounts for more than half of the world’s slot-co-ordinated airports, where slots are agreed and arranged in 
advance of travel seasons in a bid to match demand to capacity and satisfy airline preferences for timing – to make 
connections, for example. For the summer 2018 season, 104 airports in Europe are level-three slot co-ordinated – 
ANALYSIS: Europe's airports face capacity crunch E European hubs are struggling to keep pace with growing 
demand for travel as short-term solutions fail to over....
applied to the busiest airports with high demand throughout the day – while 76 operate under level-two control, 
which suggests they are near capacity at some points during the day.
That strategy, though, is not enough. “To say [slot] co-ordination is a short-term solution to a lack of infrastructure is 
no longer realistic,” IATA’s head of worldwide airport slots, Lara Maughan, said at the end of last year. “Slot co-
ordination is more and more a staple in an industry where capacity is not keeping pace with demand.”
Amsterdam Schiphol airport offers an example of the multifaceted challenges at Europe’s busiest airports – in this 
case exacerbated by the limits placed on traffic by strict noise and environmental requirements.
GROWTH AMBITIONS
KLM chief executive Pieter Elbers earlier this year bemoaned the proportion of slots given to low-cost carriers at 
Schiphol, claiming this was hindering his carrier’s growth ambitions.
Elbers will be hoping that the opening of Lelystad airport as a second facility in Amsterdam – scheduled in two 
years – will help relieve that pressure.
Plans to open Lelystad to commercial traffic were recently pushed back a year to 2020, in order to assuage 
residents’ concerns.
The decision follows a consultation period with residents, administrators and users of the airspace. “The design 
routes were unexpected for many people before the summer, and errors in the noise calculations damaged 
confidence,” the infrastructure ministry says.
Royal Schiphol Group chief executive Jos Nijhuis expresses his disappointment: “The Dutch aviation sector now 
has to wait even longer for a political and social decision made 10 years ago to be implemented. I find that 
[situation] disappointing.” It remains to be seen how keen carriers will be to relinquish slots at Schiphol in favour of 
Lelystad when the latter finally opens.
Elsewhere in Europe, plans to tackle infrastructure constraints are moving at a snail’s pace – London Heathrow’s 
proposed third runway being a case in point.
While the UK government continues to favour Heathrow as the location for its capital city’s new capacity, there is 
still a long way to go before ground is broken. Indeed, IAG chief executive Willie Walsh recently put the odds of the 
project actually happening at 50:50.
The desperate need for slots in London led Walsh to highlight the possibility that Gatwick airport could use its 
emergency runway to boost its capacity.
Speaking before the UK parliamentary transport select committee in February, Walsh noted that the UK airport had 
“talked about extending their capacity by using their emergency runway” and added: “I certainly wouldn’t rule that 
out.”
Gatwick has one operational runway, but also has a second parallel runway that is used as a taxiway.
A parliamentary committee report warned in March, meanwhile, that the government must make a number of 
changes to the policy framework it intends to use to approve the expansion of Heathrow in order to “minimise any 
chance of a successful legal challenge” against the project.
The report by the transport select committee urges UK parliamentarians to approve the government’s Airports 
National Policy Statement when it comes up for vote, but only once a number of concerns have been addressed.
The Civil Aviation Authority should test at an “appropriately early stage” whether the expansion of Heathrow is 
“affordable and financeable”, the report recommends.
ANALYSIS: Europe's airports face capacity crunch E European hubs are struggling to keep pace with growing 
demand for travel as short-term solutions fail to over....
“Such a test should offer an opportunity to halt the planning process if it is evident that the proposed scheme has no 
realistic prospect of being built,” it states.
Should the project go ahead, the sheer demand for future slots is already a cause for concern among incumbent 
operators.
Virgin Atlantic chief executive Craig Kreeger recently urged the UK government to establish a new “independent 
process” to distribute slots at an expanded Heathrow, in order to create a “viable, vibrant marketplace”.
Speaking in mid-March, Kreeger said applying the current IATA slot regime in force at the airport to an expanded 
Heathrow would create a “bias” in favour of new entrants. Airlines that are not already flying to the London hub 
would be given “priority for new slots, relative to existing providers”, he suggests.
Kreeger argues that, as slots not taken up by newcomers would be allocated to incumbents based on their current 
shares of capacity at the airport, the process would “effectively limit” most airlines to obtaining around 4% of new 
slots each. The exception to this would be the “group of carriers” that controls 55% of slot capacity at Heathrow, he 
says, alluding to IAG.
Meanwhile, even when a new facility has been built, there is no guarantee that it will come into service, as 
demonstrated by Berlin’s recent woes.
BEGINNING AGAIN
After reviewing progress on the long-delayed Berlin Brandenburg airport, its operator said at the end of last year 
that it had approved a management report commissioning the opening of the facility for October 2020.
“There is consensus that a responsible and valid assessment is now available, which provides a realistic basis for 
further work until commissioning,” it says.
Brandenburg was developed to replace the city’s Tegel and Schönefeld airports, but the project has been plagued 
by delays. Many stakeholders now suggest the new facility might not be fit for purpose.
According to the Irish Times, Thorsten Dirks, a Lufthansa board member and head of its Eurowings budget 
subsidiary, told a closed-door event in Bavaria recently: “My prognosis: [Brandenburg airport] will be torn down and 
built anew.”
For now, the German capital continues to be served by two ageing facilities.
At Frankfurt Main at least, the country is seeing some progress towards infrastructure improvements, with a new 
Terminal 3 slated for opening in 2023.
Elsewhere in western Europe, Vienna airport’s operator is analysing a March legal ruling giving the go-ahead to 
construct a third runway, after tighter environmental conditions were imposed.
While Flughafen Wien says the ruling is “positive”, it will only commit to construction when it has “legal certainty” 
over the scheme.
Meanwhile, Portugal’s government has outlined plans to turn Montijo air base into a second international airport 
serving the capital, Lisbon. The government has entered into a memorandum of understanding with Portuguese 
airports operator ANA and its owner Vinci Airports to develop the facility, which lies to the southeast of the city.
Environmental studies are due to be completed by mid-2018. The government says Montijo needs to be developed 
to ease pressure on Lisbon’s existing Portela airport.
ANALYSIS: Europe's airports face capacity crunch E European hubs are struggling to keep pace with growing 
demand for travel as short-term solutions fail to over....
Whatever the success or otherwise of several projects under way in western Europe, the pressure for action is 
growing greater by the day as more and more aircraft join the region’s fleet. As recent experience shows, there are 
unlikely to be any quick wins.

Over 250 people gathered at the City Hall in Cork yesterday for the 7th instalment of the it@Cork Tech Summit 
2018, which welcomed tech gurus from the US, UK, Germany and further afield, along with some of Ireland’s 
indigenous foremost tech thought leaders. 
A broad array of topics were discussed at the event, from the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on healthcare, to 
the tech industry’s responsibility to make social media as safe a space as possible for children.
AI is not new but the exponential rise in computer processing power is making the impossible possible. The Summit 
explored how these technologies, along with crypto currencies, can reduce business costs, elevate success and 
finance business in new and exciting ways.
Attendees at this year’s event got the opportunity to meet a live cyborg to see first-hand how humans can be 
augmented by biohacking with the next generation of embedded sensors and non-medical implants.
This year’s speakers also discussed how digital and genomic technologies, 3D-Printed organs and facial-
recognition therapies are converging to make healthcare and treatments more personalised and precise.   Speakers

Officer, RyanAir Sonja Herman, Research fellow, Principal Investigator, Trinity Centre for Bioengineering Professor 
Barry O’Sullivan, Founding Director, Insight Centre for Data Analytics, UCC Don O’Leary, Head of EU Operations / 
Ireland Country Lead, Stripe Niamh Bushnell is the Founder and CEO of TechIreland
Speaking yesterday, Chair it@cork, Caroline O’Driscoll said, "This year’s conference asked some interesting 
questions of the blend between machine and human. Where is our society going? What technologies will shape our 
future? Are we ready for it? Do we want to be? What about ethics, regulation and privacy?" 
Over 250 people attend the it@Cork Tech Summit 2018
She added, "But if we get this right, are the opportunities for life-saving sectors like HealthTech for example, truly 
transformational? No-one has all the answers, but today’s speakers certainly shed a great deal of light on the 
discussion around developing technologies and their impact on society as a whole."

Wizz Air, the Hungarian low-cost airline, has obtained licences for its UK subsidiary in part to ensure it can keep 
operating in the UK after Brexit.
Jozsef Varadi, chief executive, said: "Brexit may give legal uncertainties so we need to plan legal contingencies ... 
It's safer to have a UK airline to make sure we preserve the rights we have been enjoying."
Wizz Air UK, based at Luton airport, is moving is in the opposite direction to UK-based easyJet, which is setting up 
a subsidiary in Vienna so it could continue intra-EU flights post-Brexit.
Mr Varadi said: "Brexit is going to be a well managed process in the end ... It's in the interest of all parties." London-
listed Wizz Air is central and eastern Europe's largest carrier, with more than 600 routes and 29.6m passengers in 
2017-18, and is the eighth-largest airline group operating in the UK.
Alex Paterson, an analyst at Investec, said central and eastern Europe represented a "huge opportunity" for the 
airline over the next five to 10 years.
Kathryn Leonard of Numis was bullish "based on the structural growth of the market" but said Wizz needed to 
consider Ryanair, which was active in the market.

Europe’s leading low-cost carrier expects its profits to fall in the current financial year due to pricing pressure and 
rising costs.
Ryanair posted net profit of &euro;1.45 billion ($1.7 billion) for the 2017/2018 financial year, but expects that to 
contract to between &euro;1.25 billion and &euro;1.35 billion this year.
Noting “those EU airlines who continue to expand despite having no prospect of achieving profitability”, Ryanair 
predicts “above-average EU capacity growth to continue into FY19, which will have a downward effect on fares”.   
Ryanair’s revenues from priority boarding and other ancillaries climbed by 4% per passenger in 2018 as the low-
cost carrier posted a pre-tax profit of &euro;1.6 billion, 10% more than in the previous financial year.   With 
ancillaries rising to 28% of total sales, the Dublin-based airline posted operating cash flow of &euro;2.2 billion for 
the year to 31 March 2018.
Offset by negative investment cash flow of &euro;719 million and negative &euro;1.2 billion from financing activities, 
this left Ryanair with net cash flow of &euro;291 million.
Year-on-year net margin was unchanged at 20%.
During the year the airline increased its fleet from 383 to 431 aircraft as it took delivery of 50 new Boeing 737-800 
aircraft. The number of owned aircraft rose from 350 to 400.
Following the conversion of 25 options in April, Ryanair has 110 firm orders and 100 options for 737 Max 200 
aircraft, which will be delivered from 2019 through 2024. At 31 March 2018 the airline had 29 outstanding orders for 
737-800s.
After 9% passenger traffic growth in 2017/18, Ryanair forecasts 7% growth in the current financial year, an outlook 
it describes as “on the pessimistic side of cautious”.
Soft yields remain a challenge, Ryanair says, while it also expects fuel price headwinds over the next two years. 
The airline has 90% of its fuel requirements hedged at $58 per barrel for the year to 31 March 2019.
In April 2018 Ryanair agreed to buy a 24.9% stake in Austria company Laudamotion, which itself acquired much of 
the assets of former Air Berlin carrier Fly Niki.
Ryanair "pessimistic" about 2018/19
“LaudaMotion is an attractive opportunity as it is an Airbus operator, and we are looking for opportunities to grow its 
Airbus fleet to 30-50 aircraft over the nextfive years,” states Ryanair.   Citing ongoing airline consolidation in 
Europe, Ryanair aims to “build a substantial and profitable group of EU airlines under the Ryanair Holdings banner 
over the next 3 years”.

Ryanair denies having made an approach for Norwegian Air to take a 20% stake in the carrier, Reuters reports.
The newswire cites a source with close knowledge of the discussions as saying that Ryanair made the approach 
last year. Norwegian’s chief executive Bjoern Kjos also confirms there had been contact between the companies 
and brought it up with the board, but declines to discuss details.
“There is no truth to these claims. We have not made an approach to Norwegian and we have no interest,” Ryanair 
says in a statement to Reuters.
When contacted byAirfinanceJournal, Ryanair repeated the statement given toReuters, adding: "Our CEO has 
repeatedly said we believe NAS will go bust as oil rises to $80 a barrel and we don’t catch falling knives.”
Airfinance Journal reported on 22 May that International Airlines Group plans to make an offer of &euro;1.52 billion 
($1.79 billion) for Norwegian.

Ryanair has appointed Carol Sharkey as chief risk officer, 23 years after she joined the airline.
"Carol has an encyclopedic knowledge of our business and how we deliver controlled growth safely, and her 
expertise particularly in the area of operations and safety will ensure she plays a key role in our future growth to 
some 600 aircraft and over 200 million customers per annum,” said Ryanair chief executive officer Michael O'Leary.
Sharkey's previous experience at Ryanair includes roles in flight operations and the flight safety department, where 
she was most recently director of safety and security.
In her new position, she will assume responsibility for all of Ryanair’s operational risk assessment and will report 
directly to the CEO.

Ryanair announced plans on Thursday to open a base at Duesseldorf's main airport in its latest expansion into its 
key target market of Germany in the wake of the collapse of rival Air Berlin.
The Irish airline, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, said it will base one aircraft at the Duesseldorf Airport from June 
to service routes to Spain.
Tickets for 12 routes from the same airport operated by Laudamotion, a new airline formed from Air Berlin 
subsidiary Niki and acquired in March by Ryanair, will also be sold by the Ryanair web site.
The move is the latest challenge by Ryanair to Lufthansa , which last year overtook the Irish carrier as Europe's 
largest by passenger numbers. Lufthansa’s Eurowings is currently market leader at Duesseldorf.
Germany has been slow to open up to low-cost airlines, which typically account for about 10-20% of traffic at 
Germany's airports compared to a short-haul market share of over 50% in Europe as a whole.
Ryanair has a 9% market share in Germany compared to 15% across Europe as a whole. It currently flies from 
Weeze Airport, 70 kms (45 miles) northwest of Duesseldorf. (Reuters)

European unions representing Ryanair cabin crew on Tuesday gave the airline until June 30 to adopt national 
employment laws for all their workers or face industrial action during the summer, the unions said after meeting in 
Lisbon.
The SNPVAC union, which represents Ryanair Portuguese cabin crew staff, staged a strike early in April over what 
it says is the airline's failure to recognize Portuguese labour rights, including doctor-approved sick days.
Five unions representing Ryanair European cabin crew met on on Tuesday and agreed on the deadline. Their 
demands include respecting national legislation where cabin crew are based and applying the same work 
conditions for all workers.
"If Ryanair fails to comply with these terms, the undersigned unions will initiate all the statutory and legal 
procedures to call a coordinated industrial action, including the use of strike action, during the summer of 2018," 
they said in a statement.
The unions present included Belgium's CNE/LBC, two Spanish unions and Italy's UILTASPORTI.
Ryanair's contracts in Portugal have prompted the Socialist government to look into the terms of employment. 
Labour Minister Jose Vieira da Silva has said that while most Portuguese crews' contracts were signed under Irish 
jurisdiction, the EU Treaty of Rome still guarantees worker rights under local laws. (Reuters)

Highlight: What do you do when a manager isn't proving their worth? Our anonymous contributor looks at 
rewarding performance.
Body
Fund houses are under more pressure than ever to justify fees. Here the founder of an asset management 
boutique speaks anonymously about the challenge of remunerating performance and long-term thinking.
People want value for money. That is universally true. As someone who flies a lot, I notice this in air travel. People 
pay low fees for Ryanair flights and cannot really complain when they get an experience that reflects the below-
market cost. If they were paying the equivalent of an Etihad flight and getting a Ryanair experience, that is a 
different story.
We can see the same in funds. If you are paying the Etihad price for a Ryanair fund, you would not be best-
pleased. So, what can fund houses do? The question of fund fees is not going away, and Allianz and Fidelity have 
made changes, but it is not a challenge just for the bigger players – the long-haul carriers – to contend with.
What we can do is make 100% certain that your fund manager fees look at the long-term and not at short-term 
targets which trigger bonuses or other compensation. We can do this with set time goals, but also by insisting on 
skin in the game – after all, the pilot has to go the same way as the plane. If you don’t think your manager’s 
interests are aligned, why would you invest?
On top of that, we have adopted an outperformance model as well, which means the fund managers do well when 
the fund does well. This, of course, has to be communicated strongly, else you get daredevils trying to push the 
fund to higher and higher (read: riskier and riskier) heights to make up for previous shortfalls.
This is where active share comes into its own and brings us back to the active/passive split. After all, you can’t have 
‘active share’ without ‘active’. Here you need a good bank of analysts who are able to navigate your managers into 
unknown but attractive areas where they can make these returns. It’s not as easy as it sounds, but a crucial part of 
any good fund manager is the people behind them.
However, what happens when things go wrong? All planes experience turbulence and some even crash, so what 
can you do about it? If you have seen the film Sully, that is active management in a nutshell. A skilled professional 
managed to avert a disaster – landing a falling plane on the Hudson River – and it was a much better outcome than 
what could have happened.
Secret boutique founder: finding the right flight path on fees
However, he was investigated and scrutinised over how he reacted and why it crashed at all. All managers face 
similar tough questions when times are hard, but it is the reaction we should focus on. What the pilot did was the 
human advantage. He was the human factor that made the difference in an extreme situation.
In this age of increased automation, it makes sense to have a human at the helm who is able to do something 
innovative when it really counts. Just make sure that the compensation they are receiving matches the performance 
expected of them. See you in the skies.

Boeing, Ryanair Finalize $3 Bln Order For 25 737 MAX 8s
Boeing, Ryanair Finalize $3 Bln Order For 25 737 MAX 8s

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Boeing Co. (BA) announced Tuesday that it has finalized an order with Ryanair Holdings 
Plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) for 25 additional high-capacity 737 MAX 8 airplanes. 
 The $3 billion order, at current list prices, was previously listed as unidentified on Boeing's Orders & Deliveries 
website.  Ryanair expects to take delivery of first Gamechanger in Spring 2019.  Ryanair launched the high-capacity 
737 MAX 8 in late 2014 with an order for 100 airplanes, followed by an additional order for 10 airplanes at the 2017 
Paris Air Show. The airplane will provide Ryanair with 197 seats, increasing revenue potential and delivering up to 
14 percent lower fuel consumption than today's Next-Generation 737s.  The Dublin-based carrier is the largest 737-
800 customer in the world and the largest Boeing operator in Europe.  Boeing noted that Ryanair took delivery of its 
500th Next-Generation 737-800 last month and has now ordered more than 650 Boeing airplanes.  Neil Sorahan, 
chief financial officer, Ryanair, said, 'We are pleased to announce the exercise of 25 Boeing 737 'Gamechanger' 
options, bringing our firm order to 135 737 MAX 8s. The Gamechanger has eight more seats than our current 189-

airplanes.
Body
The $3 billion order, at current list prices, was previously listed as unidentified on Boeing&#39;s Orders & Deliveries 
website."We are pleased to announce the exercise of 25 Boeing 737 "Gamechanger" options, bringing our firm 
order to 135 737 MAX 8s," said Neil Sorahan, chief financial officer, Ryanair. "The Gamechanger has eight more 
seats than our current 189-seat Boeing 737-800NG and incorporates the latest technology engines and winglets 
which reduce fuel consumption and noise emissions, ensuring we remain Europe&#39;s greenest, cleanest airline 
and lowest cost airline. We look forward to taking delivery of our first Gamechanger in Spring 2019."Ryanair 
launched the high-capacity 737 MAX 8 in late 2014 with an order for 100 airplanes, followed by an additional order 
for 10 airplanes at the 2017 Paris Air Show. 
The airplane will provide Ryanair with 197 seats, increasing revenue potential and delivering up to 14 percent lower 
fuel consumption than today&#39;s Next-Generation 737s."We are delighted that Ryanair is deepening their 
commitment to the 737 MAX as they continue to grow their fleet and expand their network," said Ihssane Mounir, 
senior vice president of Commercial Sales & Marketing for The Boeing Company. "Ryanair&#39;s follow-on order 
shows once again that the high capacity 737 MAX 8 is the perfect airplane for low cost carriers. The airplane gives 
our airline customers more seats to serve their core markets, maximizing revenue potential at the best cost per seat 
in the industry."The Dublin-based carrier is the largest 737-800 customer in the world and the largest Boeing 
operator in Europe. Last month, Ryanair took delivery of its 500th Next-Generation 737-800 and has now ordered 
more than 650 Boeing airplanes.The 737 MAX incorporates the latest CFM International LEAP-1B engines, 
Advanced Technology winglets, Boeing Sky Interior, large flight deck displays and other features to deliver the 
highest efficiency, reliability and passenger comfort in the single-aisle market.The 737 MAX is the fastest-selling 
airplane in Boeing history, accumulating almost 4,500 orders from 96 customers worldwide.

Budget carrier Ryanair is ordering another 25 Boeing 737 Max 8s, taking its overall commitment to 135 of the re-
engined twinjets.
Boeing had previously attributed the aircraft to an undisclosed customer.
Ryanair had ordered 100 firm 737 Max 8s in 2014 – along with 100 options – and subsequently ordered a further 10 
during last year's Paris air show, although it retained its 100 options.
But the latest order for 25 represents the conversion of 25 of the carrier's options. Ryanair says it will hold 75 
options on the 737 Max as a result.
The airline is to receive its first Max in spring next year.
Ryanair's new agreement for the 197-seat aircraft is worth $3 billion at catalogue prices, says Boeing. It takes the 
airline's 737 orders to more than 650.
All 737 Max jets are powered by CFM International Leap-1B engines.

Belfast's airports are to submit evidence to a consultation on the future of air passenger duty (APD) for short-haul 
flights in Northern Ireland in a bid to have the tax abolished.
Speaking to FlightGlobal at the Routes Europe event in Bilbao, Katy Best, commercial director of Belfast City 
airport, says she is hopeful the region can "lead the way" to the removal of APD across the UK.
"It's a piece that the Northern Ireland airports are working collectively on," Best states, adding: "That consultation 
period closes in June and collectively there will be a number of parties across the industry that will be making 
submissions.
"The fact that Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK with a land border to a country that doesn’t have APD does 
make a case for us to perhaps lead the way in terms of removal of APD."
A consultation on the removal of the £13 ($18) APD charge is happening as part of the "confidence and supply" 
agreement reached by the Democratic Unionist Party with the ruling Conservative party in the UK parliament.
Northern Ireland removed APD from long-haul flights in January 2013.
Speaking at the same event, Belfast International airport managing director Graham Keddie describes the abolition 
of the tax as a "no brainer" for the UK government to allow the gateway to compete more effectively with the likes of 
Dublin airport.
Keddie says research carried out by the airport suggests the removal of APD would "very quickly" add 1.5 million 
seats, adding that he has commitments from two airlines to "ratchet up the seat count" in Northern Ireland if the tax 
is removed.
Belfast's airports seek removal of short-haul APD;  E A consultation on the scrapping of air passenger duty for 
short-haul flights in Northern Ireland could see....
Keddie notes 75% of Northern Ireland's air traffic is domestic and is therefore taxed "twice" under APD rules.
Best states removal would "have an impact on the consumer, in terms of price point. It should have an impact in 
terms of profitability for the airlines. So there is an argument that there is a demand stimulus through that removal.
"But also it puts us on a greater footing in terms of engaging with airlines from a new business perspective. And that 
can become part of the narrative in terms of why someone should start a new route to Northern Ireland."
Airlines including Ryanair have also called for the removal of APD on short-haul flights from Northern Ireland, 
saying the charge restricts growth opportunities.

Cologne airport is bracing for the loss of 750,000 passengers over summer 2019 following Eurowings' decision to 
relocate its long-haul services to Dusseldorf, but is hopeful a new connecting product can help traffic rebound.
Speaking to FlightGlobal at the Routes Europe conference in Bilbao today, Cologne's director of business 
development Tobias Lyssy says the airport is preparing for a "massive" loss of long-haul passengers as Eurowings 
withdraws all of its long-haul routes by the winter 2018-19 season.
Lyssy says he believes Eurowings moved these operations to Dusseldorf to "protect" the market from rivals filling 
the vacuum left by Air Berlin's collapse last year.
He states that Cologne is seeking to retain passenger traffic at 12 million in 2019 by developing a self-connecting 
service, which he notes will be similar to London Gatwick's connections product.
Lyssy understands the project will involve providing baggage connecting options and insurance for missed flights. 
Self-connecting by passengers using Cologne airport is "increasing heavily", he adds.
"Our idea is to connect as many airlines as we could possibly do with this connect platform in order to get the 
maximum choices out of this," he says.
Lyssy hopes the product will be completed by the end of this year and will go live for bookings next summer. As part 
of the roll-out, construction work has just begun to provide an air-side connection between the airport's terminals 1 
and 2.
He says Cologne previously had a self-connect product in operation in 2007, but it was terminated after 
Germanwings withdrew from the venture to focus on its own offer.
Cologne seeks to offset Eurowings long-haul withdrawal E Cologne airport is bracing for the loss of 750,000

Lyssy notes the German airport is "quite optimistic" for 2018, with traffic expected to grow from 12.4 million last year 
to 12.5 million.
The "gaps" left by the collapse of Air Berlin have now been filled, partly thanks to the return of EasyJet to Cologne 
with a Berlin Tegel service from June, he says. Ryanair and Eurowings are also increasing their European 
operations at the German gateway this summer.

Upping the Ante: Elliott and Mullins face off on the Punchestown battlefield
Upping the Ante: Elliott and Mullins face off on the Punchestown battlefield

Highlight: As Willie Mullins strives to overtake Gordon Elliott at this week’s festival, can he draw inspiration from - 
of all people - Stalin? 
Body
‘Comrades, it is in strenuous circumstances that we are today celebrating the 24th anniversary of the October 
Revolution. The perfidious attack of the German brigands and the war which has been forced upon us have created 
a threat to our country. The war you are waging is a war of liberation, a just war. Let the manly images of our great 
ancestors – Aleksandr Nevsky, Dmitri Donskoy, Kuzma Minin, Dmitri Pozharsky, Aleksandr Suvorov and Mikhail 
Kutuzov – inspire you in this war!”
Preparing last week to write this piece with an eye on the Punchestown Festival commencing this Tuesday, I 
happened upon a World War II documentary and found it hard not to draw parallels between Joseph Stalin’s 1941 
speech and Willie Mullins’ challenge over the next seven days.
Mullins has wallowed in a decade- long spell as champion trainer – the race had long become a non-event – but his 
position of comfort seems to be gone forever. Gordon Elliott pushed him to the wire last season, and the Co Meath 
trainer, who won the Grand National for the second time last weekend, is now favourite to gain his first crown.
Stalin’s speech was especially significant because he smashed his own rules and evoked the spirit of past heroes 
of a Russian empire that was the antithesis of Bolshevism. Similarly, Mullins will make a mockery of his rules next 
week, more of this later on.
By the time the action starts in Co Kildare, Mullins will trail Elliott by approximately €500,000, little more than the 
figure that he faced (and conquered) 12 months ago. Jockeys’ and trainers’ title battles can be of little interest to 
anyone other than the participants. This is different.
A clip did the rounds after Aintree that epitomised Michael O’Leary: mischievous, cunning, entertaining, 
opportunistic. Late boarding the flight home, he promptly took the flight attendants’ phone and told all passengers 
Upping the Ante: Elliott and Mullins face off on the Punchestown battlefield
they were getting a free drink. Apologising that the delay was due to his having to collect his trophy for winning the 
National, he cautioned that his rare display of generosity had a limit: one drink per customer.
Given that the Ryanair chief executive’s success had quite a bit to do with free advertising, it was strangely 
reassuring to think that, despite his being a billionaire, old habits tend to linger on. And O’Leary will have a greater 
say than he might have envisaged in the outcome of the title race.
Next September will mark two years since the controversial businessman pulled the plug on his arrangement with 
Mullins. Publicly, the split was relatively amicable at the time and no different since, though it is hardly worth saying 
that the respective camps going their separate ways left a bit of a sour taste in the mouth of each.
O’Leary spread the 60 Mullins horses around five different trainers, but the bulk of his eggs have been in Elliott’s 
basket since. He wants Elliott to win the title at Mullins’ expense – and that is natural.
So if Samcro abandons novice company to take on the seniors in Friday’s €250,000 Champion Hurdle, one can 
only wonder was the title battle some part of the consideration, as he would probably win and thus deny the Mullins-
trained Melon and, potentially, stablemate Min.
In any case, this makes sense for Samcro: it will tell us more about whether he should stay hurdling or go chasing. 
Elliott pitched Labaik at that race as a novice 12 months ago – even if the circumstances were a little different (he 
had refused to race earlier in the week).
Elliott is willing to deviate from the norm when matters are of grave importance.
And this week, Mullins will run top-rung horses who raced last Tuesday at Fairyhouse’s rearranged meeting. He 
tends to give all his string at least three weeks between races.
Thus Saldier will tackle Saturday’s champion four-year-old hurdle. He ran a blinder on Tuesday when third, coming 
on from his Triumph run (especially in terms of his jumping), and he looks a cracking each-way wager at 16/1, with 
Paddy Power considering that there is surely more to come from him.
1pt each-way, Saldier in AES Champion 4YO Hurdle at Punchestown, 16/1 (scale 1-5)

The secret start-up

Byline: Post Reporter
Highlight: There's huge enthusiasm for the start-up at a dream meeting of potential investors in New York, where 
even Bono hears about his plans
Body
In a New York minute, everything can change
After six and a half years of ups and downs, I found myself in London to meet a proper VC, at the bar in the Ritz no 
less. I was wearing new clothes bought with the few bob the gregarious Dublin businessman had given me. It had 
felt like Communion money: once I got it, I just had to spend it. I bought the essentials in Dunnes, and a jacket in 
H&M to tie it all together.
The VC I was to meet was part of a large investment firm in the US. I Googled him and learned that the firm had a 
few billion under management – whatever that meant. The investor himself – we’ll call him Richard Smiley – was in 
his early fifties. He was an all-American kinda guy, well put together, with a bright happy vibe.
What stood out was that he had a big pearly white smile. He didn’t seem to have an ounce of the melancholia that I 
had. Everything to him was just “great”. He was the type who would take regular breaks to the Hamptons on his 
yacht with his well-manicured family. For recreation he’d like a bit of tennis or racquetball.
“So, tell me all about it. I want to hear the story from you. Where do you want to take it?” all said with a big smile. I 
told him the fun, colourful story, complete with the grand ambition that I had rehearsed so well at the incubator.
“Well listen, I think it’s really greet [his “greats” would sound like “greets”]. I just love it. I think there is huge potential 
here too. I just can’t believe I haven’t heard about it until now. It’s amazing.” Big smile.
Not for the first time in this story, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I was sitting opposite a VC who had possible 
access to big funds who was telling me how great everything was.
The secret start-up
“So, let me cut to the chase. Here is what I want to do. We want to invest maybe a quarter of a million. But we think 
you are going to need more. So what we want to do is get three or four other investors involved and raise maybe a 
million dollars. You’re going to need it if you really want to grow it.”
A million dollars! I’d had to borrow the money for the Ryanair flight to the meeting, now a million dollars was being 
dangled in front of my eyes by a VC I’d met about 40 minutes ago.
“Let me get back to New York and work on rounding up other investors. But really, it’s so greet. I hope we can make 
it happen.”
Back in Dublin I exchanged emails with Richard Smiley as he asked more detailed questions about the operations. 
He became a bit more of a stickler. “Now, I need you to be specific here,” still with the smiley tone.
A few days had passed when my phone rang. It was a US number. I picked up. The voice was a droll American.
“Hello, is this secret start-up man?”
He didn’t say that obviously. But you know what I mean.
“It’s Bob Ziegfield.”
Bob Ziegfield! Bob was one of the biggest, and smartest, investors in the world our start-up occupied. He was co-
founder of one of the world’s biggest platforms. It was surreal. He was a rock-star investor. If you met him, you’d 
probably ask for his autograph. I paced around my apartment.
“Listen, I just heard about what you’re doing, and it’s really something remarkable.”
After six years of nobody important really catching onto what we were doing, it was incredible to be hearing this 
from, frankly, a dream investor. I was thinking, “Yes, that’s what I have been saying for the last six years. It’s 
amazing.”
After asking me where I saw it going, he told me what he wanted to do.
“Listen, this is something we want to be part of. You have an opportunity to take it in so many ways. There is a huge 
brand potential. We want to invest. Now it’s up to you. We can do this alone or we can work with your other investor 
in the round. What would you like?”
What would I like? I was being given options now. I thought quickly. If I was being heartless I could have jumped 
exclusively in with Bob Ziegfield. He had it all. But Richard Smiley in London had clearly spread the word so I 
thought it best that I continue with his strategy to build a round of investment with three or four investors.
“Okay, great. We’re in. We’ll get in touch with Richard Smiley and work on building the round with him.”
Three days later I had another phone call. “Hello. It’s Kevin Zucker.”
Kevin Zucker, the man who revolutionised online dating, calling me! He offered me the same feedback.
“It’s great. We want to be part of it. But listen, we need to know who we are investing in. You have to come to New 
York and meet us. We’ll organise a meeting for all the investors. Can you come over here next week? We want to 
move fast.”
It really did happen that fast (not counting the six years prior). A week later, I was in New York. I crashed on a 
friend’s sofa. I felt I like I was in the waiting room to the rest of my life . . . next to be called. I met Richard, Bob and 
Kevin in a slick, colourful office on Broadway and East 3rd Street. It was a boardroom surrounded by glass. The 
outer walls had lots of colourful trinkets representing the kind of worlds they invested in. There was a Damien Hirst 
Mickey Mouse head made out of bubblegum, and a Banksy for good measure. The sun shone brightly outside. It 
was all just so cool. It was the New York big-investor meeting dream.
The secret start-up
Despite the colour all around, Ziegfield, who was in his sixties, didn’t smile much. He had little or no outward 
warmth. He looked dead serious. I guess that’s what business is when you get to a certain level. It’s dead serious. 
Kevin Zucker was much older, late seventies maybe. He was very craggy-faced. I sensed he was just in it to hit the 
jackpot, as he had with many other investments. I didn’t get any feeling that he really ‘got it’.
The meeting with the investors was solid, if unspectacular. They were all on board.
“When are you leaving town?” Bob asked.
“Thursday.”
“Let’s try to set him up to meet Linda Murphy,” Bob said peering over his spectacles to the assistant taking notes.
I didn’t know who Linda Murphy was, but I was happy to meet anyone.
My four days in New York to meet the investors were still four days in New York, a city that casts a special mystique 
over many. I felt I should make the most of the trip, as I didn’t know when I’d return. And so the nights were long 
and full of revelry.
The day before I was due to fly home to Dublin, I woke up in a fright. I’d had a blackout from the night before. Who 
knows what happened. Blackouts had become common in my life. I was disorientated as I filled a pint glass of 
water trying to get my bearings, trying to remember what I had to do.
Damn, I have to meet Linda Murphy at 8am! Who meets that early?
I looked at the clock. It was 7.43am. Fuck.
I wanted to throw up in the back of the cab, which I instructed to step on the gas to take me to the Gramercy Park 
Hotel for our conversation. If you don’t know the Gramercy Park area of New York, it is very classical – old 
brownstone buildings with lush, leafy trees. And sitting at the centre of it is the five-star Gramercy Park Hotel. It’s a 
nice setting, to say the least.
I wobbled into the cafe/restaurant where I was to meet Linda. My hangover was overpowering. I must only have 
slept only two or three hours. It was one of my worst in recent memory, and that’s saying a lot. I knew there was 
going to be no hiding it.
The concierge brought me to the table where Linda was already seated. I wasn’t late. I never am. It was 8am on the 
dot. Linda was in her late fifties and had an unassuming presence. She looked like your sweetest aunt. After we 
greeted each other, I had to tell the truth.
“Linda, I have to be honest with you. I apologise, but I was out a bit late last night and am a bit worse for wear.”
“You’re Irish, right? I expected as much. Have a coffee and you’ll be fine. I’m a Murphy don’t forget, so I have some 
understanding.”
That put me a bit at ease. Linda wasn’t Irish, for the record. She just had an Irish surname.
We had a good banter between us. I loved her vibe more than anyone else I’d met on the trip. I told her my whole 
story as my body raced on coffee and booze. When I get talking in that state, I can be like a runaway train, as 
thoughts fill my head. I get delirious. The mission then is to stay deliriously entertaining, and not delirious like a 
madman. It’s a tough balance. The talking distracted me from my hangover pain.
“I love it,” Linda said. “What an amazing story. It’s what it should all be about.”
After chatting for an hour I realised that I didn’t really know who Linda was. I vaguely knew she was involved in one 
of the biggest companies in our industry, but I didn’t know what her exact role was.
The secret start-up
“Linda, this is a bit embarrassing, but do you mind me asking what it is you actually do?”
In hindsight, I think she might have found a bit of charm in that. I’m sure she wasn’t used to people meeting her 
blindly.
“Well, I started at the company at the very beginning, 30 years ago. I worked my way up to the chief executive 
position of that, and the other companies under the umbrella, where I was for the past 20 years. I just stepped down 
a few months ago.”
Who was I sitting next to? Who was I blabbering to? Who had I presented myself hungover to, like a fool? This 
woman was literally at the very top of the tree. This woman was an industry legend. She was almost an icon in her 
own right. Think Sheryl Sandberg, but cooler. And here I was just chatting away to her full of banter like she was 
anyone. You would think my new knowledge was good reason to change my conversational approach, but it was 
too late. I just acted like what she told me had no major impact.
“Wow, that’s mad,” I said before going straight back to our regular tone of conversation. After a two-hour chat she 
told me that she had to leave, as she had to go to another meeting.
“Where you off to?” I asked casually, as a friend might.
“Oh, Bono’s in town,” she responded nonchalantly. “Something about Africa . . .”
Bono! Don’t hate me, readers, but I am an unapologetic U2 lover – a proper super fan. It was hard for me to keep 
my cool in that moment.
When Linda left, I scrambled for my phone to look her up. Her profile defied belief. She was on the Forbes list of 
100 most powerful women in the world. If I was to put together a dream list of people to be involved in my company, 
she would probably be number one. She was the person I had been looking for my whole life. But it was only 
coffee, I reasoned.
After the meeting I emailed my other investors and told them how well the meeting had gone with Linda. Bob 
Ziegfield responded quickly.
“If you really think you got on well with her, I would offer her 5 per cent equity if she could be an adviser on your 
board. Every company in America wants her,” he advised.
I decided to email her just to say that I enjoyed our meeting. It was genuine.
“Linda, really enjoyed meeting you and our conversation. Sorry again for being so hungover.” To my surprise she 
wrote back immediately.
“Don’t be silly. It was great to meet you. I loved your story. By the way, I just met Bono. He loves what you do too. 
He’s a fan. Please let me invest.”
Incredible. Whatever anyone wants to say about Bono, the one thing I have noticed about him in interviews is that 
he rarely, if ever, has a bad word to say about anyone. Many have something bad to say about him, but he 
manages to respond with positivity. I think there is something to be learned in that. If you don’t have anything nice 
to say, don’t say anything at all. And let’s face it, that’s not something the Irish excel at.
I can only conclude that when asked about what we did by Linda, Bono thought it right to give a positive plug for an 
Irish company. I would be amazed if he knew too much more about us beyond that.
Regardless, I think that one little email from Linda telling me of Bono’s endorsement was the high point of my 12 
years of start-up turmoil. It’s the little things.
The secret start-up
Ps: the names in these sections have been changed, so don’t go googling them. They don’t exist. Except for Bono .

Ryanair balks at Irish union recognition demands

 Ryanair, which pledged to recognise unions to avert widespread strikes late last year, has balked at Irish union 
FORSA/IALPA's demands to be recognised as the representative for pilots in its home market.
Ryanair Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson in a letter dated April 13 seen by Reuters told FORSA/IALPA that a 
number of changes it had suggested to a draft agreement were "totally unacceptable now or at any time in the 
future".
The budget airline has been in talks to formalise union recognition in several European countries since its decision 
in December to recognise unions for the first time in its 32-year history.
Pilots in Britain and Italy - its two largest markets - have reached agreement and Ryanair said last month that a deal 
was close in Spain. However, progress has been slower in Portugal and Ireland.
The areas of disagreement with the Irish union included rostering, dispute resolution and Ryanair's requirement that 
the union recognises its low cost model, according to Wilson's letter.
Wilson said Europe's largest low-cost carrier would not move or resile from its proposed draft agreement and 
suggested it meet the union soon to finalise that agreement.
He also criticised the union for taking a month to respond to its proposal, saying the "glacial pace" of the talks was 
frustrating.
A spokesman for FORSA/IALPA said it does not comment while industrial relations negotiations are ongoing. A 
spokesman for Ryanair said it does not comment on negotiations with its staff.
Ryanair balks at Irish union recognition demands
Ryanair expects some disruption to flights where it is struggling to reach agreements, Chief Executive Michael 
O'Leary has warned.
It cancelled a number of flights to and from airports in Portugal last month after a strike by some of its cabin crew.
Ryanair operates from 87 airports across 36 countries in Europe and North Africa. (Reuters)

The last five years has been nothing short of tumultuous for SpiceJet. Having undergone a back-from-the-dead 
fairytale after surviving a near collapse in 2014, the airline has completed its turnaround, with a clear focus to keep 
growing.
In an unforgiving domestic sector crowded with around 10 established players, SpiceJet is one of four low-cost 
carriers that also compete with full-service stalwarts such as Air India and Jet Airways, as well as start-ups like 
Vistara. Data from India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation shows that SpiceJet has, over the past three years, 
consistently been ranked among India’s top five airlines in terms of domestic market share.
With two consecutive years of profits under its belt, scars from the carrier's near-death experience are starting to 
fade. Its rise-from-the-ashes story has one man to thank – founder Ajay Singh.
Bryan van der Beek
At SpiceJet's headquarters in Gurgaon, New Delhi, the 52-year-old tells FlightGlobal he started SpiceJet in 2004 
because he saw "a great need for maturity" in Indian aviation. Then, about 16 million people commuted daily by 
train in India – about the same as the number of air passengers in an entire year.
In the telecommunications industry at that time, the entrepreneur saw "a golden opportunity" – and seized it.
"We had seen the impact of reducing tariffs to generate demand [in the telecommunications sector]. Therefore, it 
seemed to me that if you had a model where cost in aviation was kept low and tickets were sold at a reasonable 
price, there would be immense demand in this country," he recalls.
INTERVIEW:  E Ajay Singh, managing director, SpiceJet The last five years has been nothing short of 
tumultuous for SpiceJet, having undergone a back-from-the-de....
"That model seemed to exist in Europe with Ryanair and EasyJet and at Southwest Airlines in the United States. I 
thought there was a possibility of replicating those models [in India]."
DARKEST DAYS
Although SpiceJet was loss-making in its initial years of operations, the carrier was profitable before its ownership 
change in 2010. The next four years, however, saw its performance go downhill.
Indian media tycoon Kalanithi Maran, through KAL Airways, which was part of his Sun Group conglomerate, initially 
held a 38.7% stake in the carrier in 2010. Maran and KAL's stake, however, ballooned to 86.2% by 2014 after 
aggressive share acquisitions.
By 2010, Singh held only a 4.13% stake in the carrier he founded. He eventually exited SpiceJet after selling that 
stake in the open market.
By 2014, SpiceJet had amassed losses totalling over $360 million. To compound the situation, the carrier had at its 
peak in the same year, carried a debt of around Rs20.2 billion ($310 million). The airline was eventually grounded 
on 16 December 2014 after it had to cancel 230 flights, largely due to companies refusing to refuel its aircraft on 
account of payment defaults.
The carrier did not stay on the ground for long. Partial operations resumed three days later when Singh returned as 
SpiceJet's white knight, backed by private equity. Had SpiceJet been permanently grounded, it would have become 
the second major Indian carrier to collapse in three years, following the demise of Kingfisher Airlines in 2012.
Bryan van der Beek
Singh says that when SpiceJet was sold to Maran, it was profitable and also had "significant reserves". He also 
reveals that he was approached by Maran to buy back the airline as there were plans for it to shut down.
"I felt there was still a great potential that still existed in the aviation sector. Even at that time, there was still less 
than 3% of people flying in the country. There was an opportunity and the market could still grow. SpiceJet was a 
brand that most people in the country already knew, and therefore, it would be relatively easy for me to take that 
brand forward [rather] than to start something else," he says.
"A little bit of it was also emotional – it was a brand that I helped start and it was painful to see the brand fall into 
such disarray. I wanted to make sure the brand survived."
When Singh started his second stint with SpiceJet in fiscal 2015, the carrier had a total debt of around Rs17.1 
billion. By fiscal 2017, that figure was reduced to Rs9.5 billion.
FROM THE ASHES
Upon his return, Singh’s top priority was to restore the airline's credibility. There was an urgent need to instill 
confidence in passengers that the airline was there to stay, and to clearly communicate the steps being taken to 
remain airborne.
"Nobody wanted to book seats or do business with us, be it partners or suppliers We had to explain to people our 
plan [to restart full operations]. Why would they book tickets in advance if they felt the airline was not going to be 
there?"
The airline chief also made the decision to wet-lease several aircraft in the initial phase of the restart, which though 
an "expensive option", was necessary to "maintain the sanity" of its schedules.
INTERVIEW:  E Ajay Singh, managing director, SpiceJet The last five years has been nothing short of 
tumultuous for SpiceJet, having undergone a back-from-the-de....
The next step was to lower the cost of operations that had soared in the preceding years, and to increase its 
revenue and load factors. To that end, it had to renegotiate engineering and fuel contracts; consolidate its network 
by quickly axing unprofitable routes; and implement measures to boost ancillary revenues.
For fiscal 2017, SpiceJet's CASK ex-fuel stood at Rs2.43 ($0.04), down 20% from a year ago. Its RASK, 
meanwhile, came in at Rs3.76. Ancillary revenues made up 15% of its total income, up from a mere 5% when the 
carrier was first launched.
Aircraft utilisation has also risen, with its Boeing 737 fleet operating more than 13h daily and its Bombardier Q400 
turboprops logging more than 11h. The carrier adds that its load factors have been over 90% for the past 33 
months, and that its on-time performance is also among the best in India.
Bryan van der Beek
Singh says SpiceJet’s "resounding" financials are proof that it has learnt from past experiences. While the carrier 
has not released its full 2018 financials, the first nine months ended 31 December 2017 saw it post an operating 
profit of Rs5.2 billion, up 48.5% year-on-year. Net profit was Rs5.2 billion, up 34%.
Since taking over from Maran, Singh has led SpiceJet to record full-year net profits of $69 million and $64 million in 
fiscal 2016 and 2017, respectively.
"It is about the basics – you need to get your operations right; continuously work to reduce CASK; continuously 
work on increasing the RASK. But ultimately, it's about credibility and confidence. You need to make sure that you 
live up to the commitments made to the public, and at the same time infuse confidence in your own team and 
partners that there is a bright future ahead."
NEW AIRCRAFT
Singh believes that India's aviation market still has a long way to go to reach its full potential – particularly on the 
international sectors, since there is growing affluence among the middle class. As such, SpiceJet is "seriously 
looking" at soaring its wings beyond the 7h mark.
He shares that there is a dedicated team within its revenue department studying further international expansion, 
and that the carrier is keen to reach more points within Southeast Asia, as well as make its first foray into Europe.
FlightGlobal schedules data shows that SpiceJet predominately operates domestic services, although its network 
also reaches Bangkok, Dubai, Muscat, Kabul, Colombo and Male.
"We will only [have more international services] if we can bring cost down to a level [middle-class passengers] can 
afford and we can be profitable. India is a strategic location between ASEAN and African countries where 
economies are growing, and Europe where there are traditional holiday destinations."
Singh has pointed out the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 as suitable types with which to start intercontinental 
services, but says their price tags have thus far prevented such a move. Now, the broad plan is to start long-haul 
international services only after the airline receives most of its outstanding aircraft orders.
Flight Fleets Analyzer shows the carrier has 60 aircraft in service, comprising 38 737NGs and 22 Q400s. It is set to 
grow exponentially with its backlog of 167 aircraft (122 737 Max 8s, 20 737 Max 10s and 25 Q400s) on order.
Delivery of the Max will start from August and the carrier plans to add up to 15 of the narrowbody type, as well as 
six to nine Q400s by the end of 2018. For the next two years, it will take about 25 737s and 15 Q400s through sale-
and-leasebacks. Financing options for deliveries from 2020 are still being looked at.
INTERVIEW:  E Ajay Singh, managing director, SpiceJet The last five years has been nothing short of 
tumultuous for SpiceJet, having undergone a back-from-the-de....
The carrier is also sitting on a letter of intent for 20 additional Max 10s, with options for 50 units of an unspecified 
type (widely reported to be widebodies) and 25 Q400s. Should its LOIs be fully exercised, SpiceJet would have a 
total orderbook of around 260 aircraft.
However, it still needs to catch up to match the scale of its largest low-cost rival, IndiGo. Flight Fleets Analzyer 
shows IndiGo operates a fleet of 156 A320s and ATR 72s and has a staggering 398 more aircraft on order. On the 
full-service front, dominant players Air India and Jet Airways operate a fleet of 129 and 119 aircraft, respectively.
HAMPERED BY AIRPORTS
Despite the optimism in SpiceJet's own ambitions, Singh laments India's failure to keep its airport infrastructure 
competitive against the likes of Dubai and Singapore – particularly in the area of transforming its gateways into 
major air hubs.
For years, India has seen hub leakage to Dubai International airport (on to Europe and the USA) and Singapore’s 
Changi airport (on to Southeast Asia and Australia), and Singh firmly believes "the time is right" for India to build its 
own international hubs.
Bryan van der Beek
"There was no real plan from private and government-owned players to compete with the international hubs. No 
other base carriers took advantage of Air India's growing weaknesses as a hub carrier. But with Air India's 
privatisation, other full-service and low-cost airlines looking at long-haul low-cost operations need to ensure enough 
domestic capacity to hub out of India."
He points to India's metro airports such as those in Delhi, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, as well as the upcoming Navi-
Mumbai International, not only as international hub options, but also as growth opportunities for SpiceJet.
In the near term, the majority of India's airports are expected to have greater domestic links, especially to tier-two 
and tier-three destinations that have seen an economic boom. Connections will also be boosted by the country’s 
Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) – launched in October 2016 with the objective of facilitating and stimulating 
regional air connectivity by making air travel more affordable.
To date, the airline has launched four routes under the scheme, and Singh says he is "very happy" with their 
performance and yields that have done “very well”.
"We had expected that the routes would pick up over several months, but they have picked up much faster than 
that," he continues. "Our RCS routes have been operating at around 90%-plus load factor. The three-year 
exclusivity [for each RCS route] has been useful for us. We also wanted first-mover advantage given the amount of 
growth in such areas. Should there be a third round of RCS bidding, we will definitely do it."
SpiceJet's network strategy is to focus on profitability and to launch services on potentially high-yield routes that 
can feed into its hubs.
LONG-TERM VISION
In the meantime, Singh says he has been trying to instill a culture of freedom and independence within the 
company, while preserving “the mentality of a start-up”.
"We have key people in revenue, finance and airports [departments] who run it like it is their own business. They do 
not refer to me other than for broad directions. But we should not get too complacent and need to consistently work 
at reducing cost and increasing revenue. There must always be a little sense of desperation in the company."

With a staff-strength of around 8,000, the carrier is also planning for its future manpower needs. It is building its own 
training campus, which will be completed by the end of the next financial year. The facility is expected to reduce 
training costs by half.
While Singh is open to potential foreign investments into the carrier, he says there is no rush on account of the 
carrier's healthy profits over the past years.
Looking ahead, he also rules out any form of early exit: "I am here for the long term. This is a great business to be 
in, there are many opportunities still around. I would like to be here for the foreseeable future."

The last five years has been nothing short of tumultuous for SpiceJet. Having undergone a back-from-the-dead 
fairytale after surviving a near collapse in 2014, the airline has completed its turnaround, with a clear focus to keep 
growing.
In an unforgiving domestic sector crowded with around 10 established players, SpiceJet is one of four low-cost 
carriers that also compete with full-service stalwarts such as Air India and Jet Airways, as well as start-ups like 
Vistara. Data from India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation shows that SpiceJet has, over the past three years, 
consistently been ranked among India’s top five airlines in terms of domestic market share.
With two consecutive years of profits under its belt, scars from the carrier's near-death experience are starting to 
fade. Its rise-from-the-ashes story has one man to thank – founder Ajay Singh.
Bryan van der Beek
At SpiceJet's headquarters in Gurgaon, New Delhi, the 52-year-old tells FlightGlobal he started SpiceJet in 2004 
because he saw "a great need for maturity" in Indian aviation. Then, about 16 million people commuted daily by 
train in India – about the same as the number of air passengers in an entire year.
In the telecommunications industry at that time, the entrepreneur saw "a golden opportunity" – and seized it.
"We had seen the impact of reducing tariffs to generate demand [in the telecommunications sector]. Therefore, it 
seemed to me that if you had a model where cost in aviation was kept low and tickets were sold at a reasonable 
price, there would be immense demand in this country," he recalls.

tumultuous for SpiceJet, having undergone a back-from-the-de....
"That model seemed to exist in Europe with Ryanair and EasyJet and at Southwest Airlines in the United States. I 
thought there was a possibility of replicating those models [in India]."
DARKEST DAYS
Although SpiceJet was loss-making in its initial years of operations, the carrier was profitable before its ownership 
change in 2010. The next four years, however, saw its performance go downhill.
Indian media tycoon Kalanithi Maran, through KAL Airways, which was part of his Sun Group conglomerate, initially 
held a 38.7% stake in the carrier in 2010. Maran and KAL's stake, however, ballooned to 86.2% by 2014 after 
aggressive share acquisitions.
By 2010, Singh held only a 4.13% stake in the carrier he founded. He eventually exited SpiceJet after selling that 
stake in the open market.
By 2014, SpiceJet had amassed losses totalling over $360 million. To compound the situation, the carrier had at its 
peak in the same year, carried a debt of around Rs20.2 billion ($310 million). The airline was eventually grounded 
on 16 December 2014 after it had to cancel 230 flights, largely due to companies refusing to refuel its aircraft on 
account of payment defaults.

Air Berlin fall triggers big shift at Tegel; German market experiences 
significant change in the wake of carrier's collapse, with EasyJet and others 
adding capacity

Attendees at this year’s ILA Berlin show arrive in the German capital after a period of intense change in the 
country’s airline market.
The effects of this are most keenly felt at Berlin Tegel, where the familiar red and white livery of defunct Air Berlin 
has been replaced by other airlines backfilling capacity.
The fragmented nature of Air Berlin’s model, established through a series of acquisitions, means its fall has rippled 
across various market segments – and beyond Germany.
After Abu Dhabi’s Etihad pulled the plug on further investment in Air Berlin, the German carrier initiated insolvency 
proceedings last summer, sparking the break-up of the group.
Overall short-haul capacity in Germany – defined as flights within the European Economic Area and Switzerland – 
is set to climb slightly over the summer. FlightGlobal schedules data for April-September shows seat capacity rising 
by about 2%. That is lower than the 4% growth last summer, though, and the 7%-plus increase in the summer of 
2016 – a year in which Ryanair expanded rapidly in the German market.
Air Berlin, together with Niki, had its largest presence at Tegel and Düsseldorf airports, accounting for more than 
half of its short-haul capacity last summer.
Easy pickings
The largest chunk of that has been taken up by EasyJet. The UK budget carrier began operations at Tegel in 
January after completing a deal to acquire assets including aircraft and airport slots from Air Berlin’s administrators.
Air Berlin fall triggers big shift at Tegel German market experiences significant change in the wake of carrier's 
collapse, with EasyJet and others adding capac....
For a cost of 40 million ($49 million), EasyJet agreed to lease up to 25 former Air Berlin Airbus A320s for operations 
from Tegel, recruit 1,000 flightcrew formerly with the Oneworld member, and acquire other assets including the 
slots.
EasyJet, which had already been active at Berlin Schönefeld, is now the biggest operator at Tegel and has 
launched 10 new routes from the site, three of which have switched from the German capital’s other airport.
Eurowings is the other big mover – even accounting for capacity formerly operated under the Germanwings name. 
Factoring in the mainline operation, plus siblings Austrian Airlines and Swiss – all of which will operate increased 
capacity this summer – Lufthansa Group will be the biggest overall operator on short-haul European routes 
from Tegel.
Air Berlin had already operated some capacity for Eurowings under a wet-lease agreement, but the latter’s capacity 
at Tegel has been boosted by its acquisition of German regional carrier LGW from the administrators of its failed 
rival.
Laudamotion and Ryanair, meanwhile, have announced a series of flights to be operated by the former from Tegel. 
Laudamotion will station four aircraft in Berlin from the start of June to operate 17 routes largely drawn from former 
Niki destinations.
It is a different story at Düsseldorf, where short-haul European capacity is set be down more than 10% year-on-year 
this summer. Last summer Air Berlin and Niki operated about 40 routes from the west German site, most of which 
had one or more carriers on them.
Eurowings has made the most gains at the airport, and is now comfortably the largest operator from Düsseldorf.
But Lufthansa and Condor will also increase their capacity from the German hub this summer. The latter is 
expanding after its parent, Thomas Cook, acquired assets from the Air Berlin Aviation subsidiary.
While EasyJet and Ryanair lead the way in terms of seat capacity from Berlin overall, neither has made significant 
inroads at Düsseldorf.
Ryanair was a vocal critic of the deal allowing Lufthansa to acquire assets from Air Berlin. The Irish carrier’s chief 
executive, Michael O’Leary, speaking in Brussels in early March, returned to this theme. He said Ryanair wanted to 
grow in Germany, but that it was “very hard to base more aircraft in those airports, because you have Lufthansa 
[and its ex-Air Berlin slots] and Eurowings sitting there like bed-blockers, blocking all the morning slots”.
Not everything went Lufthansa’s way, however, as it failed to secure approval for a deal to acquire Niki in Austria.
And ultimately, once legal issues scuppered IAG’s bid for the carrier, Ryanair ended up acquiring it by striking a 
deal with the successful bidder, Niki Lauda, for an initial 24.9% stake in the business, eventually rising to 75% if 
competition approval is granted.
shout lauda
Ryanair is paying 50 million for the stake, and will provide another 50 million for “year-one start-up and operating 
costs”, along with “financial and management support”.
Chief operations officer Peter Bellew cites Ryanair’s desire to accelerate growth in Austrian, German and Swiss 
markets as a key consideration behind its Niki purchase.
“We’ve also been growing quickly [in the German market],” Bellew says. “We’ve nearly increased by a third there in 
the last 18 months or so. We feel there’s loads of business there.”
While Air Berlin’s demise may be keenly felt by some, for others its departure has been a golden opportunity.

Niall Gallagher, manager of the £1.8 billion GAM Star Continental European Equity  fund, believes that Europe’s 
recovery will gather strength, with Spanish and Italian stocks picking up the baton.
Last year marked a watershed for European compnay earnings, with stocks either matching or beating expectations 
after six years of disappointment.
That was reflected in a strong showing from European markets, which beat the returns of the US and UK, and the 
rallying euro.
‘We’ve been optimistic for a while, we picked up cyclical names early 2014 when European economies started 
doing better and have progressively become more optimistic,' said Gallacher.
‘To take advantage for the recovery, we are currently very cyclically positioned in our fund and overweight domestic 
European earnings,’ said the Citywire A-rated manager.
The recovery in Europe has helped the fund enjoy its longest period of outperformance since 2007, with the fund 
returning 40% over three years to the end of February, compared to 32% from the MSCI Europe ex-UK benchmark.
Holding on
Despite the move into cyclicals, turnover in the portfolio remains low.
‘We have a low name turnover, with only a handful of companies coming into the portfolio and a handful coming 
out. A lot of the holdings in the portfolio I have held for a very long time,’ explained Gallagher (pictured).
‘Inditex (ITX.MC), Ryanair (RYA.I), Hexagon (HEXAb.ST), LVMH (LVMH.PA), Grafton Group (GFTU_u), 
Kingspan (KSP) and Paddy Power Betfair (PPB), I have held for something like 15 years.’
GAM’s Gallagher looks to next leg of Europe's rally
These core holdings, which Gallagher likes for their above-average returns on capital employed, make up the 
majority of the fund, which has a total of 35 stocks.
The portfolio’s current active share is 87% compared to its benchmark, and Gallagher is happy to stick to his guns.
‘I’m not looking to rotate the portfolio too much, rather shift it through time; for example, right now, that’s why I’m a 
little bit more cyclical and a bit less international,’ he said.
‘The fund is currently made up of cyclical growth from its European earnings and fast growing structural growth 
outside of Europe in luxury and tech sectors.’
The cyclical names are mainly in the construction and building materials, automotive and banking sectors. These 
sectors will stand to benefit from a strong growth in earnings should Europe’s recovery pick up pace, he said.
‘We have two house builders, Aedas (AEDAS.MC) in Spain and Cairn Homes (CRN) in Ireland. Both are new 
companies founded in the last few years that have similar business models. They bought non-performing loans 
from banks, structured these loans so that they took over the collateral, which was typically a land bank of a bust 
real estate developer that was seized by a bank or a national “bad bank”.
‘The reason why we think that is a good business model is because both Spain and Ireland are in the midst of a 
housing crisis, because house building slowed to a crawl after the financial crisis and there is a lot of demand for a 
new land bank with a pristine balance sheet and lots of cash.’
Recovery spreads
The geographic allocation of the fund also reflects the fund manager’s view on the European recovery.
‘We have a fair exposure to Spanish and Italian names, reflecting our view that the recovery has only just got 
underway there. In Spain this comes from names like Aedas and media company Mediaset España (TL5.MC) as 
well as core holdings like Caixabank (CABK.MC) and clothing retailer Inditex,' said Gallagher.
‘Conversely, we are very underweight Switzerland and have only one investment in power company Schindler 
(SCHP.S). The reason is simply that we believe the Swiss companies are seriously expensive.’
The fund’s earnings split is also tilted towards Europe, with 55% in domestic earnings.
‘Typically our exposure to overseas earnings is 50-50, but as we have taken a positive view on earnings growth 
potential in Europe we have increased our exposure,’ explained Gallagher.
Despite this bias towards European earnings, the fund’s two most recent purchases are both value plays targeting 
international earnings.
‘We have been adding Bayer (BAYGn.DE) over the past year or so. The new chief executive announced that he 
was buying Monsanto, which was a change in the company’s policy,’ said Gallagher.
‘Up until that point they had been selling off their chemical businesses and focusing on pharma. The announcement 
caught a lot of shareholders by surprise and the share price took quite a big hit off the back of that.
‘We are positive on the Monsanto acquisition and believe that the agricultural economics sector is an interesting 
one. If you combine Monsanto’s seed developments with Bayer’s chemical intellectual property then you get a firm 
that controls more than a quarter of the world’s seed and pesticides market.’
Another name that has made it into the fund is luxury jewellery maker, Pandora 
‘Controversially, we’ve also started buying Pandora (PNDORA.CO) in recent months,’ said Gallagher.
GAM’s Gallagher looks to next leg of Europe's rally
‘The stock was out of favour because it is seen as quite faddy and the company had been a little slow in renewing 
its rolling stock.
‘We’ve gained a lot of comfort from speaking to the company that it is speeding up its innovation to improve 
replenishment and the brand’s strong presence in its established markets dispel the idea that it’s faddy. Last year, 
sales slowed down but they were still pretty decent, they are still growing revenue and growing profits.’

Niall Gallagher, manager of the £1.78 billion GAM Star Continental European Equity  fund believes that Europe’s 
recovery is ‘well and truly on’.
In his opinion, Europe has shrugged off Brexit and the spectre of the eurozone debt crisis, so that corporate 
earnings, which had been depressed for a very long time, are growing steadily.
‘We’ve been optimistic for a while, we picked up cyclical names early 2014 when European economies started 
doing better and have progressively become more optimistic.
‘To take advantage for the recovery, we are currently very cyclically positioned in our fund and overweight domestic 
European earnings,’ said the Citywire A-rated manager.
The recovery in Europe has helped the fund enjoy its longest period of outperformance since 2007, with the fund 
returning 40.4% over three years to 28 February, compared to the 31.98% delivered by its benchmark, the MSCI 
Europe ex UK index.

The portfolio’s current active share is 87% compared to its benchmark, and Gallagher is happy to stick to his guns. 
He estimates that only 15-20% of the fund’s allocation is geared to take advantage of the change in economic 
cycle.
‘I’m not looking to rotate the portfolio too much, rather shift it through time; for example, right now, that’s why I’m a 
little bit more cyclical and a bit less international,’ he said.

New recovery
The geographic allocation of the fund also reflects the fund manager’s view on European recovery.

delighted to have Ryanair as one of our new Premier Corporate Partners. As a Corporate Partner, Ryanair will 
enjoy a range of benefits for its staff, the opportunity to attend  exciting behind the scenes visits and private tours,

world class exhibitions as well as to invest more in its permanent collection and public engagement programme."
Ryanair’s Head of Communications, Robin Kiely added, "We are pleased to have entered into this partnership with 
the National Gallery of Ireland, which enables Ryanair to support one of Ireland’s leading institutions of cultural

INM’s many ‘persons of interest’ deserve answers from a probe

Jacqueline O’Brien is a senior counsel who represented the Moriarty Tribunal. Jerry Healy also worked as a senior 
counsel for the Moriarty Tribunal. The tribunal’s final report was published in March 2011. According to the report, 
Michael Lowry “delivered” the state’s second mobile phone licence for the businessman Denis O’Brien. Moriarty 
found that O’Brien transferred £447,000 to various Lowry-controlled accounts; arranged for a $50,000 loan for Fine 
Gael (it was returned) and supported Lowry in obtaining a £420,000 bank loan. Both men have rejected the 
tribunal’s findings, but have not formally challenged them in court.
Between 2010 and 2015, Nick Cooper was corporate services director for Cable & Wireless, which has a significant 
stake in the mobile phone business in the Caribbean and is a competitor of Digicel, the telecoms business 
controlled by O’Brien. James Osbourne, who died last year, was a veteran of the Irish boardroom, serving on the 
board of Ryanair and bookseller Eason. He was also a former chairman of Independent News & Media, before 
being ousted at the annual general meeting in 2012. O’Brien, the largest single shareholder, voted against his re-
election.
Karl Brophy is a former INM journalist and executive, who now runs his own public relations firm, Red Flag. He is 
embroiled in a lengthy legal battle with O’Brien over an alleged conspiracy to damage the planned flotation of 
Digicel in 2015. He has strenuously denied the allegations.
Mandy Scott is the executive office manager of Red Flag. She formerly worked as executive personal assistant to 
Gavin O’Reilly, when O’Reilly was chief executive of INM. Writing in this newspaper last week, O’Reilly said that 
Scott, in that role, had “full access to all my emails and files, automatically.”
Joe Webb is a former chief executive of INM’s Irish division, before leaving the company in 2013. Vincent Crowley 
is a former chief executive of INM. He now serves on the board of a number of publicly listed companies. Donal 
Buggy is a former chief financial officer of INM, while Ann Marie Healy and Andrew Donagher also worked with the 
company.
INM’s many ‘persons of interest’ deserve answers from a probe
Brendan O’Connor is a journalist and broadcaster, who is currently deputy editor of the Sunday Independent. 
Maeve Sheehan is a well-regarded journalist with the Sunday Independent. Sam Smyth is an investigative 
journalist, columnist and radio broadcaster, who held a variety of senior roles in INM. He exposed a political scandal 
that led to the resignation of Lowry as a minister, with revelations that businessman Ben Dunne had financed an 
extension to Lowry’s home. Rory Godson is a former journalist, Goldman Sachs adviser and now runs his own 
financial PR consultancy, representing a string of blue chip corporate clients.
This diverse and scattered list of 19 names are united by one thing: an alleged data breach at INM. The Director of 
Corporate Enforcement has stated in an affidavit that the 19 “persons of interest” were the focus of an alleged data 
breach in 2014.
In a statement last week, INM stated: “INM does not know whether any such searches were in fact undertaken or 
for what purpose but based on the limited information currently available to INM it seems possible that they were. 
INM also does not know to whom any results of any such searches might have been provided.”
Tomorrow the ODCE will ask the High Court to appoint inspectors to investigate activities at INM. One part of that 
will be the breach – why it happened, and who the information was shared with. The 19 names deserve answers.
So too the employees at INM, past and present.

British Airways owner International Airlines Group is weighing up a takeover offer for Norwegian Air Shuttle after 
acquiring a 4.6 per cent stake in the lowcost carrier that has disrupted Europe's airline industry by launching cheap 
long-haul flights.
IAG said it had bought the stake to start talks with Norwegian, "including the possibility of a full offer" for the airline, 
whose stock leapt on the news. It said no discussions had yet taken place and cautioned that it was not certain to 
make a takeover offer.
IAG has taken advantage of weakness in Norwegian's shares to make its move. The low-cost airline has faced 
increasing questions on its finances as its rapid growth put pressure on costs. It continues to lose money despite 
the fact the rest of the industry is in good shape.
Norwegian said that there had been no talks and that it had only found out about IAG's purchase from the media.
"Norwegian believes that interest from one of the largest international aviation groups demonstrates the 
sustainability and potential of our business model and global growth," it said.
IAG was created from the merger of BA and Spain's Iberia in 2010 as part of a consolidation drive in the European 
industry. Subsequently it bought Aer Lingus of Ireland in 2015.
IAG snaps up Norwegian Air stake ? BA owner pounces on long-haul disrupter ; ? Move designed to spark 
talks on 'full offer'
Norwegian has expanded rapidly, first becoming the number three in European low-cost airlines behind Ryanair 
and easyJet before starting long-haul flights to the US and Asia.
Low-cost carriers have enjoyed success in short-haul markets since Southwest Airlines of the US pioneered the 
approach in the 1970s. But the long-haul market, where costs among the legacy airlines are already low, has 
proved harder to crack.
Some analysts believe Norwegian is succeeding and said IAG would be very interested in its long-haul operations. 
Norwegian's biggest long-haul base is at Gatwick in BA's backyard.
The UK flag carrier, and rivals Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, are responding with their own lower-cost offerings. 
Kenneth Sivertsen, an analyst at Pareto Securities in Oslo, said: "It will be a challenge for carriers like BA to build a 
low-cost long-haul operation, due to a lot of legacy costs. The fit is extremely good between IAG and Norwegian."
Shares in Norwegian closed up 47 per cent yesterday, giving it a market capitalisation of NKr10bn ($1.3bn).

In the battle for the skies over the Atlantic, International Airlines Group is eyeing another co-pilot.
The owner of British Airways has taken a 4.61 per cent stake in Norwegian Air Shuttle, the low-cost airline that 
launched ultra-cheap US flights from Europe, leading to a scramble among established performers to mimic 
offerings or risk losing passengers. It said that it would "initiate discussions with Norwegian, including the possibility 
of a full offer for Norwegian".
IAG, which also owns Vueling, Aer Lingus and Iberia, brings with it financial muscle to help nurse Norwegian's 
wounds, which include deep losses and a debt mountain of NKr22.3bn ($2.9bn).
But its investment, or even a full takeover, does not solve the Scandinavian carrier's most fundamental problem - 
how to make money flying passengers across the Atlantic for less than £70.
"Unless you have the right business model, deeper pockets only help you fund losses for longer," said Jonathan 
Wober, analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation.
IAG has timed its approach as its quarry looks to raise badly needed finances to help it deal with increasing levels 
of red ink.
Norwegian gives IAG a route to long-haul travel Airlines. Consolidation ; British Airways ' owner eyes possibility 
of a full offer as it takes stake in budget c....
Last year, Norwegian booked a loss of NKr299m against a profit of NKr1.14bn a year earlier - its third year of losses 
in the past four. Michael O'Leary, chief executive of rival Ryanair, even went as far as to predict last September that 
Norwegian would run out of cash in "four to five months".
The move also comes at a time of consolidation among European airlines, driven by corporate failures as years of 
discounting drive the need for scale.
EasyJet, which recently bought the collapsed airline Air Berlin's operations at Tegel Airport, is vying with Lufthansa 
to buy out Alitalia, which the Italian government is seeking to keep running.
In its brief statement yesterday, IAG offered little insight into the rationale for its move, leaving analysts and industry 
insiders to speculate over the myriad reasons it might want to invest in another low-cost carrier.
BA, which missed out on the low-cost short-haul bonanza in Europe by selling its cut-price Go brand to easyJet, is 
keen to avoid a similar mis-step when it comes to the lucrative long-distance market.
IAG has launched Level, a Spainbased low-cost service offering hand luggage-only flights to the US, but the 
fledgling operation remains a long way behind Norwegian in its share of the budget market.
"Growing that to scale organically is very, very difficult," said Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Bernstein.
IAG may also bring a degree of business restraint to Norwegian, where years of rapid growth have led it to plan 
ventures as varied as domestic flights in Argentina and leasing aircraft to other carriers - on top of operating its 
existing European short-haul network while pioneering long-haul budget travel.
"They have been fighting battles on many fronts for too long," said Mr Wober at CAPA.
The move may also give Norwegian the chance to offload some of the 200 aircraft it ordered in 2012 to other IAG 
brands, Mr Roeska at Bernstein suggested.
Norwegian's strategy of avoiding larger airports and flying "point to point" from cities such as Edinburgh or Dublin 
avoids the costs of the "hub and spoke" model offered by larger performers, but leaves potential customers the 
problem of reaching those secondtier airports.
IAG's network of short-haul flights would offer additional travel options, regardless of whether the businesses merge 
fully.
At the same time, Norwegian has built a formidable presence at Gatwick, rivalling BA's position at the UK's 
secondbiggest airport.
"A partnership that looks to maximise the synergies of the two networks, minimise duplications of capacity and 
investment on key routes, and use IAG's travel management capabilities to improve Norwegian's expertise in this 
area, could all provide some of the benefits of consolidation without the likely high cost of a deal," Mr Roeska wrote 
in a note yesterday.
He believes IAG would be gambling if it bought the airline outright because it has no proof that synergies will work 
and the business can be run profitably.
But the risk in creating synergies now is it drives up the value of the business - making it even more expensive if 
IAG does want a full takeover.
Ultimately, the move brings Norwegian funding at a time when it was looking to raise more capital by selling some 
aircraft and putting its frequent flyer scheme up for sale.
Norwegian gives IAG a route to long-haul travel Airlines. Consolidation ; British Airways ' owner eyes possibility

Stephen Furlong, at Davy Research, said: "Norwegian has been doing in lowcost long-haul what Ryanair did in 
lowcost short-haul. The difference is that Ryanair did it with conservative financial leverage. Norwegian needed a 
partner with muscle. Perhaps this is it."

International Airlines Group has good strategic reasons for wanting to buy Norwegian Air, the latest pioneer of low-
cost long-haul air travel. The chance to irritate Ryanair merely adds spice. Michael O'Leary, whose rehab from 
motormouth appears a work in progress, said last year he expected Norwegian to go under. Proving him wrong 
might amuse Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG.
Cynics will suspect that keeping a handle on transatlantic competition would be the main motive for IAG. The 
group's largest airline, British Airways, fought ferociously in its time with Virgin Atlantic and Laker Airways.

International Airlines Group has good strategic reasons for wanting to buy Norwegian Air, the latest pioneer of low-
cost long-haul air travel. The chance to irritate Ryanair merely adds spice. Michael O'Leary, whose rehab from 
motormouth appears a work in progress, said last year he expected Norwegian to go under. Proving him wrong 
might amuse Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG.
Cynics will suspect that keeping a handle on transatlantic competition would be the main motive for IAG. The 
group's largest airline, British Airways, fought ferociously in its time with Virgin Atlantic and Laker Airways.
The latter, a forerunner of Norwegian, went bust in 1982. Bears think the newbie is flirting with the same fate. Net 
debt of NKr22.3bn ($3bn) at the last record date was 13 times forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation

PUNTERS get their last chance to boost the Grand National coffers in tomorrow's Ryanair Stayers Hurdle (4.20pm) 
and this race has been very kind to them over the years.
Big Buck's won it four years running from 2009 to 2012, while no winner has been priced bigger than 5/1 in the past 
decade.
SAM SPINNER was strongly fancied for last month's Stayers' Hurdle at Cheltenham and although he ran 
respectably to finish fifth, the race wasn't really run to suit.
In hindsight, I'm sure Joe Colliver wishes he'd made it more of a test, but the horse will have learned plenty from it 
and Aintree's long home straight should be perfect for him.
Jedd O'Keefe's six-year-old has had a brilliant season, bolting up in a competitive handicap at Haydock before 
landing the Grade One Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot in December.
Ground conditions will be ideal for him and I can see him leading from pillar to post. Anything above 2.2 on 
BETDAQ represents value.
Wholestone is a good horse, but most of his best form has come at Cheltenham, including when third in the 
aforementioned Stayers' Hurdle last time.
There's no reason to suggest he won't handle Aintree - and he'll be fine on the ground - but I'm not sure he's quite 
as classy as Sam Spinner.
The Betway Mersey Novices' Hurdle (2.25pm) is a fascinating contest and at the prices I'm going to take ON THE 
BLIND SIDE to beat Black Op.
Sam set to leave his Stayers Hurdle rivals in a right spin
Nicky Henderson's runner was forced to miss Cheltenham, but that could be a blessing in disguise.
He's unbeaten, handles soft ground and both the track and trip should be ideal.
He will be around the 3.3 mark on BETDAQ which I'd much rather take than the 2.1 about Black Op.
POINTERS TOMORROW On The Blind Side 2.25pm Aintree Sam Spinner 4.20pm Aintree

RENEWED caution among investors dented Britain's top share index yesterday as Western forces discussed 
possible military action against Syria, although strong results from Tesco pushed its shares higher.
The FTSE 100 was down 0.1 per cent, though it remained near the six-week high it reached on Tuesday after 
several days of gains.
"Western military action against Syria seems imminent - and that is obviously going to lead to lots of worse things 
than yield curves being flattened/leveled entirely if it happens," Rabobank analysts said in a note.
Energy stocks tumbled as crude prices dipped, though escalating tension in the Middle East kept Brent above $70 a 
barrel.
The silver lining was Britain's biggest retailer Tesco , which topped the FTSE 100, jumping 5.6 per cent to a two-
year high after it beat its profit forecast.
"There's less of a threat from Lidl and Aldi and people are gravitating back to things like Tesco," said Paul Mumford, 
fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management, referring to German discount retailers. The escalation of tensions 
over a chemical attack in Syria weighed on travel stocks after air traffic control agency Eurocontrol warned airlines 
to exercise caution in the eastern Mediterranean due to possible air strikes into Syria in the next 72 hours.
Budget airlines Easyjet and Ryanair declined 0.3 and 0.8 per cent, while cruise operator Carnival dropped 1.7 per 
cent and Intercontinental Hotel fell 0.7 per cent.
High dividend-paying consumer staples stocks such as Unilever, Diageo and Reckitt Benckiser, which investors 
usually reach for in times of market stress, all fell. Traders said strengthening pound was clouding the case for 
buying these big exporters which benefit from a weaker sterling/dollar exchange rate.

The notion of a 28-hour working week and hefty pay rises sounds outlandish in Germany, land of punctilious 
productivity. But unions are serious about demanding a bigger share of the country's economic spoils. Volkswagen 
has already made a deal.
Lufthansa, Germany's largest airline, is the latest to be hit by disputes. The strike by airport ground workers is 
directed at the public sector, not Lufthansa. But there is no point flying an aircraft if passengers cannot get off with 
their bags. A one-day strike is not a real threat when Lufthansa is still flying high on its best set of full-year results to 
date. But if the "warning" stoppage turns into longer discord, it will be. Labour battles have dragged on performance 
in the past. A pilot strike in 2014 resulted in a profit warning and sharp share price fall.
Back then, the airline was in the midst of a restructuring drive to cut (EURO)1.5bn in costs and faced intense 
competition from local carriers. The fruits of those savings plus the recent collapse of rivals Monarch, Air Berlin and 
Alitalia puts it in a different position now. Operating profit rose 70 per cent to a record high of almost (EURO)3bn in 
2017 - double that of rival Air France-KLM. A chunky purchase of about half of Air Berlin has increased revenue, 
passenger numbers and capacity. Adjusted operating margins are just over 8 per cent.
Past troubles still hamper valuations. Despite last year's outperformance, Lufthansa is still valued at a discount to 
peers. At the same multiple, shares would be 7 per cent higher than now.
That does not mean 2018 will be a breeze. If discontent worsens, the airline will face pressure on labour costs and 
its pension deficit. Fuel prices have increased by about a quarter in the past year, meaning margins are under 
pressure across the industry.
Lufthansa : well grounded Twitter : @FTLex Email: lex@ft.com
And while Lufthansa cashed in on Air Berlin's woes, so did easyJet and Ryanair. Both have kick-started German 
operations.
That leaves Lufthansa in an awkward position. It expects fuel prices to rise by (EURO)700m this year and has said 
cost cuts will "largely" offset the rise, but not quite. Competition means it cannot raise prices to make up the 
difference.
That suggests earnings before the usual adjustments will be flat this year.
The airline's increased dominance of German airspace will not become clear until this pressure eases. Expect next 
year to be better.

Alexis von Hoensbroech will become Austrian Airlines' new chief executive in August, the subsidiary of German 
carrier Lufthansa announced Wednesday.
The 47-year-old manager is currently an executive board member at Lufthansa's cargo firm.
He succeeds Kay Kratky, who was likewise installed by Lufthansa to run the Austrian flag carrier. Kratky will leave 
his post upon turning 60.
"Alexis has the perfect know-how to lead Austrian Airlines in the next phase and establish it as a profitable premium 
carrier in the highly competitive Austrian market," said Harry Hohmeister, the senior Lufthansa manager who 
oversees the Swiss and Austrian Airlines subsidiaries.
Austrian Airlines' operating profit jumped 55 per cent to 101 million euros (125 million dollars) last year, thanks to 
the bankruptcies of budget carrier Air Berlin and its Austrian subsidiary Niki.
However, Niki has been re-established as Laudamotion this year, and Ryanair has announced that it plans to take 
over a majority stake of the new airline, to establish strong competition for the Lufthansa group in the German-
speaking market.

TUI Travel made a commitment for two 737 Max-series aircraft
A fter what was a slow start to 2018 for commercial orders, preliminary information from Flight Fleets Analyzer 
shows that 67 aircraft were added to production backlogs during February, balanced against 12 cancellations and 
seven swaps.
Most notably, Emirates Airline confirmed an order for 20 Airbus A380s, in what was the first firm commitment for the 
widebody type to be made in more than a year. The Gulf carrier – which is by some distance the largest customer 
for the superjumbo – had in January signed a preliminary deal for 20 examples, plus 16 options.
Boeing’s 747-8 programme also received a boost, with UPS Airlines ordering 14 Freighters, along with a further four 
767-300Fs to support its operations. An undisclosed customer also placed an order for three 777s.
This activity meant February was the second busiest month of the previous 12 for widebody deals, and also one of 
the highest-profile due to cancellations. Virgin Atlantic finally dropped its long-dormant order for six A380s – a 
commitment dating back to 2001, while the sole customer for the A330neo’s -800 model, Hawaiian Airlines, axed its 
six-unit order, after signing a letter of intent to instead acquire 787-9s.
In the narrowbody sector, orders were confirmed for 20 re-engined A320neos from as-yet unannounced customers, 
while TUI Travel signed for two 737 Max-series aircraft.
New business for regional aircraft manufacturers included a follow-on order from Bangkok Airways for four ATR 72-
600s, in what was one of the few commercial deals disclosed during February’s Singapore air show.
Fleets Analyzer records the overall commercial order backlog as totalling 15,172 aircraft at the end of February: 
down 40 from the previous month.
Demand springs back for carriers Steady month saw Emirates cement its position as the A380's largest 
customer, while Hawaiian left the A330-800neo high and dry ....
Meanwhile, our information shows that 97 aircraft were delivered to 60 operators during the month – an 18% 
decrease versus February 2017. This extends a sluggish period, following an exceptionally busy conclusion seen 
last December.
European carriers led the way with deliveries, receiving a combined 32 units. This was followed by totals of 29 and 
25, respectively, for operators in the Asia-Pacific and North America regions. Almost half of the global deliveries 
were made to mainline operators.
In the widebody sector, Air Canada, Norwegian and United Airlines each took two 787s, while freight operator 
FedEx received a pair of 767s.
Narrowbody deliveries included eight 737NGs for Ryanair, which has a backlog of 35 of the legacy model and 110 
737 Max 200s. Delta Air Lines took four A321s and two 737-900s, while Southwest Airlines received four 737-800s.
Shipments made to regional operators comprised a pair of ATR 72 twin-turboprops for Mexico’s Aeromar Airlines, 
plus an Embraer 175 and an E190 that were received by KLM Cityhopper.
Fleets Analyzer shows that the global in-service commercial fleet stood at slightly more than 28,600 units at the end 
of February, of which more than 26,000 are deployed in a passenger role. The remainder includes freighters and 
combi types.

Brussels plans more collective legal power for consumers Corporate scandals

Consumers hit by scandals such as emissions-test cheating by carmakers would get greater powers collectively to 
sue companies that violate their rights, under EU plans that reflect Brussels' frustration with corporaterule breaking.
The European Commission will on Wednesday propose giving consumer groups the right to seek compensation on 
behalf of large numbers of customers, opening up legal avenues that are limited or non-existent in many EU 
countries.
Brussels will also seek to increase the financial penalties for companies that break EU consumer law, saying 
national authorities should be able to levy fines of up to 4 per cent of turnover for "widespread infringements". 
Countries would be free to legislate for higher maximum penalties if they wished.
Vera Jourova, the EU's justice commissioner, said that the plans, which need approval from national governments 
and the European Parliament, would be "a moment for everyone to show their cards whether we are serious in 
drawing the consequences from 'dieselgate' and give a fair chance for compensation to consumers".
Ms Jourova fought Volkswagen , the company at the centre of the dieselgate scandal, over its refusal to 
compensate EU customers despite doing so in the US. The episode, along with others such as Ryanair's mass 
cancellations of flights in 2017, have hardened Brussels' view that the EU lacks the legal armoury to tackle cases 
affecting large numbers of people in multiple countries.
Brussels plans more collective legal power for consumers Corporate scandals
Jean-Claude Juncker, commission president, last year pledged a "new deal for consumers" that would give them 
better protection.
"It cannot be cheap to cheat, especially in the globalised world where the big companies have a huge advantage 
over individual consumers," Ms Jourova said. "We need to level these odds."
Citizens rights' groups have long called for greater collective redress powers, saying EU consumer law is 
underenforced. Only Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden have well-developed and functioning procedures, 
according to the BEUC, the European consumer organisation . The German government has pledged in its coalition 
agreement to introduce a new system.
"On paper European consumers have rights, but getting them respected when things go wrong is too frequently 
mission impossible," Monique Goyens, the BEUC's director-general, said.
However business leaders said Brussels risked leading the EU towards a USstyle class-action system that would 
encourage frivolous lawsuits in search of payouts. Concern has also been expressed that Brussels was overstating 
the problems consumers faced in upholding their rights. "EU citizens already enjoy the most efficient and strongest 
consumer protection in the world," Markus Beyrer, director-general of BusinessEurope, said.
Ms Jourova said her plans contained safeguards that would protect businesses from spurious cases - notably the 
fact that collective actions would only be open to consumer organisations and other non-profit groups.
"We are not following the US model, but we will make sure EU citizens can fully benefit from their rights," she said. 
"It's not about more business, but about more fairness."
Wednesday's package will also tackle other consumer issues, notably some companies' use of lower-quality 
ingredients in food sold in central and eastern Europe, even when they were branded identically to products 
marketed in the west.
Officials said rules would clarify that it was illegal to market different products as being identical.
Other changes are aimed at the online market, including giving people clearer information about the terms and 
conditions of social media networks .

and the European Parliament, would be " a moment for everyone to show their cards whether we are serious in 
drawing the consequences from 'dieselgate' and give a fair chance for compensation to consumers".
Ms Jourova fought Volkswagen , the company at the centre of the dieselgate scandal, over its refusal to 
compensate EU customers despite doing so in the US. The episode, along with others such as Ryanair 's mass 
cancellations of flights in 2017, have hardened Brussels' view that the EU lacks the legal armoury to tackle cases 
affecting large numbers of people in multiple countries.
Brussels plans more collective legal power for consumers Corporate scandals
Jean-Claude Juncker, commission president, last year pledged a "new deal for consumers" that would give them 
better protection.
"It cannot be cheap to cheat, especially in the globalised world where the big companies have a huge advantage 
over individual consumers," Ms Jourova said. "We need to level these odds."
Citizens rights' groups have long called for greater collective redress powers, saying EU consumer law is 
underenforced. Only Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden have well-developed and functioning procedures, 
according to the BEUC, the European consumer organisation . The German government has pledged in its coalition 
agreement to introduce a new system.
"On paper European consumers have rights, but getting them respected when things go wrong is too frequently 
mission impossible," Monique Goyens, the BEUC's director-general, said.
However business leaders said Brussels risked leading the EU towards a USstyle class-action system that would 
encourage frivolous lawsuits in search of payouts. Concern has also been expressed that Brussels was overstating 
the problems consumers faced in upholding their rights. "EU citizens already enjoy the most efficient and strongest 
consumer protection in the world," Markus Beyrer, director-general of BusinessEurope, said.
Ms Jourova said her plans contained safeguards that would protect businesses from spurious cases - notably the 
fact that collective actions would only be open to consumer organisations and other non-profit groups.
"We are not following the US model, but we will make sure EU citizens can fully benefit from their rights," she said.
"It's not about more business, but about more fairness."
Wednesday's package will also tackle other consumer issues, notably some companies' use of lower-quality 
ingredients in food sold in central and eastern Europe, even when they were branded identically to products 
marketed in the west.
Officials said rules would clarify that it was illegal to market different products as being identical.
Other changes are aimed at the online market, including giving people clearer information about the terms and 
conditions of social media networks .

New Austrian budget airline Laudamotion said Monday that it is ending its cooperation with travel group Thomas 
Cook and its carrier Condor, amid Ryanair's plans to take over the Vienna-based firm.
British travel firm Thomas Cook and its Germany-based subsidiary Condor had helped to launch Laudamotion by 
marketing the nascent airline's seats on their platforms.
Austrian entrepreneur and former Formula One racer Niki Lauda originally founded the airline under the name Niki 
in 2003 and sold it to the Air Berlin group in 2011.
After Air Berlin's bankruptcy, he bought it back in January and re-established it as Laudamotion with the help of 
Thomas Cook.
However, Lauda presented large Irish carrier Ryanair as an investor only weeks later in March.
Europe's biggest low cost airline said it would buy 24.9 per cent of Vienna-based Laudamotion at first, and would 
expand its stake to 75 per cent as soon as possible, pending approval from the EU market watchdog.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary sees the investment as a way to expand business in the German-speaking 
market, which is dominated by Lufthansa.

NEARLY 1,000 businesses beyond those expected reported their gender pay gap figures in time for last night's 
midnight deadline.
As City A.M. went to press, 9,982 businesses had reported their data, significantly more than the 9,000 the 
government estimated were eligible to report their numbers, based on the condition of employing more than 250 
people.
The excess was attributed to the government's original 2015 estimate being out of date, and to subsidiaries of 
businesses perhaps reporting their figures separately.
The start of the week was an urgent one for British businesses. On Monday, 1, 489 firms were still left to report their 
gender pay data.
The exercise has revealed large gender gaps among well-known names, including the leading airlines, with Ryanair 
a notable example.
The Irish airline this week reported a 72 per cent median pay gap, which surpassed Easyjet's 45 per cent gap to put 
it at the bottom of the airline pile. Women's mean hourly rate is 67 per cent lower than men's.

 Shares in London are called to open slightly lower on Wednesday, despite a rally in the US overnight.
In early UK company news on Wednesday, advertising giant WPP said it is investigating an allegation of personal 
misconduct against Chief Executive Martin Sorrell, while airlines Wizz Air and Ryanair saw a rise in passengers and 
load factor in March and Smith & Nephew appointed a new CEO.
"The trade war between the US and China is still bubbling away in the background," notes David Madden, market 
analyst at CMC Markets.
"Beijing were measured in their response in relation to the tariffs, and now the ball is in Donald Trump's court. Trade 
disputes aren't solved quickly so it is likely to be in the headlines for some time," Madden adds.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 8.16 points lower at 7,022.30 on Wednesday. 
The FTSE 100 index closed down 0.4%, or 26.15 points at 7,030.46 on Tuesday.
In early UK economic news on Wednesday, the British Retail Consortium said shop prices in the UK dropped 1.0% 
on year in March, following on from a 0.8% contraction in February.
Food prices were down 0.5% on month, the BRC said, but they were up 0.4% on year.
To come in retail news on Wednesday, the latest Kantar Worldpanel grocery share figures for the 12 weeks ending 
March 25 are at 0800 BST.
In UK company news on Wednesday, WPP said it has appointed independent counsel to conduct an investigation 
in response to an allegation of personal misconduct against Chief Executive Martin Sorrell.
The investigation is ongoing, WPP said, and the allegations "do not involve amounts which are material to WPP".
The Wall Street Journal had reported earlier that WPP's board was looking into whether Sorrell misused company 
assets, as well as investing allegations of improper personal behavior.

Smith & Nephew said it has appointed Namal Nawana as Chief Executive, and will join the company on May 7. 
Most recently, Namal was CEO of medical diagnostics company Alere Inc. Prior to Alere, Namal spent more than 
15 years at Johnson & Johnson, primarily in its Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment.
Namal will succeed Olivier Bohuon, who will step down from the board on May 7.
In the FTSE 250, Peppa Pig TV programme owner Entertainment One said its performance for the year ended 
March 31 was in line with management expectations.
The company said it saw a strong underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 
performance, with continued momentum in Family and Television and an improved second half performance in Film 
and realised cost savings.
Reported revenue for the full year is expected to be around 50% higher than the prior year, with a "similar trend" in 
underlying Ebitda. 
"Peppa Pig continues to perform well in mature markets such as the UK and Australia, with significant demand for 
licensed products in China driving further growth in the period," Entertainment One said.
The second half of the financial year saw the retail landscape affected by Toys R Us store closures in the US and 
UK. Entertainment One said it expects there to be some impact for its brands in the short term and "is monitoring 
the situation closely with its partners".
"This impact is not anticipated to be significant. Overall, eOne's brands performed well in Q4 2017 with strong sell-
through outside of Toys R Us stores," the company said.
Waste-to-product firm Renewi said the final weeks of its financial year ended March 31 were in line with 
management expectations, with its overall regard to underlying trading and cash performance for the year similarly 
expected in line.
Central Europe-focused budget airline Wizz Air said passengers and load factor ros ein March.
Passengers rose 25% to 2.5 million from 2.0 million a year before, as load factor improved by 1.1 percentage points 
to 91.5% from 90.4% a year earlier. Capacity in March rose 24% to 2.7 million from 2.2 million.
In the rolling 12 months to March 31, passengers rose 25% to 29.6 million and load factor improved by 1.3 
percentage points to 91.3% from 90.1% for the same period a year before.
Elsewhere on the Main Market, Ryanair Holdings said customers rose 6% in March to 10.0 million from 9.4 million a 
year earlier, as load factor improved to 95% from 94% "on the back of lower fares".
Rolling annual traffic to March grew 9% to 130.3 million customers, the company said.
In the US on Tuesday, Wall Street ended higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending up 1.7%, the S&P 
500 up 1.3% and Nasdaq Composite closing 1.0% higher. This came after sharp falls on Monday on trade war 
fears, with the Dow having closed down 1.9%.
In Asia on Wednesday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.1%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 
0.2%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 0.8%.
Released early Wednesday, the latest survey from Caixin showed the service sector in China continued to expand 
in March, albeit at a slower pace. The March PMI came in at 52.3, down from 54.2 in February and it missing 
expectations for 54.5, but above the line of 50 which indicates expansion in the sector.

Individually, the latest reading pointed to a modest increase in services activity that was softer than the long-run 
trend. Growth in manufacturing output was also slightly weaker than that seen on average over the series' 14-year 
history.
Similarly, Japan's March PMI signalled a slowdown in growth in the services sector. The reading came in at 50.9, 
down from 51.7 in February. Individually, there were weaker rises in both activity and new orders.
To come in the economic calendar on Wednesday, the UK construction PMI is at 0930 BST, with eurozone 
unemployment and consumer price index at 1000 BST.

Airlines based in the UK have universally reported that men in their employ earn more than women, with male 
employees dominating the highest-paid roles at all operators.
British Airways appears closest to achieving gender parity among the UK's major operators – though it still has 
some way to go – while Ryanair revealed the largest pay gap.
All businesses with more than 250 employees in the UK have been required to supply figures to the government by 
the close of 4 April as part of new regulations designed to address unequal pay. The figures are based on a 
"snapshot" of the companies' workforces on 5 April 2017 and only measure gender pay on a company-wide basis – 
they do not indicate whether women and men are paid equally for doing the same job.
As the deadline looms, figures have already been published for all major airlines with UK businesses.
In terms of hourly earnings, flag carrier British Airways pays women 10% less than men on a median basis – 
calculated by ranking all employees from the highest paid to the lowest paid, and taking the wage of the person in 
the middle. This measure is preferred in some quarters as high or low outliers do not skew the average.
As regards mean pay – a simple average of employees' earnings – BA reports a 35% gap.
BA is among several carriers that cite the domination of men in relatively highly paid flightcrew roles as having a 
significant impact on the averages.
The IAG-owned carrier states: "British Airways has been recruiting female pilots for more than 30 years and the 
percentage of female flightcrew at the airline is six percent, double the national average of around three to four 
percent. The airline recognises that there is a gender imbalance within its pilot community and is working to address 
this in part through greater visibility of its female pilots to inspire the next generation."
E UK airlines report big gender pay gaps Airlines based in the UK have universally reported that men in their 
employ earn more than women, with male employees d....
Irish carrier Ryanair – which has a significant UK operation out of London Stansted – reports a 71.8% median pay 
gap. Unusually among major carriers, that figure exceeds its mean pay gap, which averages 67%.
“Like all airlines, our gender pay in the UK is materially affected by the relatively low numbers of female pilots in the 
aviation industry,” Ryanair states.
Luton-based EasyJet released its figures some weeks ago, revealing a median pay gap of 45.5% and a mean gap 
of 51.7%.
It blamed this gap on the dominance of men in pilot roles, rather than unequal pay for the same job functions.
EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said in January: "I want us not just to hit our target that 20% of our new 
pilots should be female by 2020 but to go further than this in the future."
London Gatwick-based Virgin Atlantic has meanwhile reported a median gap of 27.2% and a mean gap that is 
much wider, at 57.6%.
At leisure carrier Jet2, the median gap is 49.7% and the mean gap 53.5%.
Fellow leisure operators TUI Airways and Thomas Cook Airlines both report median gaps of around 45% and mean 
gaps of around 55%.
Among regional carriers, Flybe reports a median gap of 41.2% and a mean gap of 45.4%. Eastern Airways reports 
respective figures of 50.7% and 46.4%, while for Scottish carrier Loganair the figures are 39.4% and 37.1%.
Looking at female representation in the top quartile of earners, network carriers fare better than low-cost and leisure 
counterparts – although they are still a long way from parity. Women account for 34% of top earners at BA and 24% 
at Virgin Atlantic. They account for just 3% of the highest-paid employees at Ryanair, 10.7% at EasyJet, 7.2% at 
Jet2, and 5% at TUI Airways. Thomas Cook Airlines reports that 17.6% of its top earners are women.
At regional carriers, women take 11.5% of the top-earning roles at Flybe, 6.2% at Eastern Airways and 8.7% at 
Loganair.
In the lowest earnings quartile, BA is again closer to parity than other operators. Some 49% of the lowest-earning 
employees at BA are women; that figure rises to 80% at Virgin Atlantic, 73.7% at Jet2, 68.9% at EasyJet and 57% 
at Ryanair. At leisure operators TUI Airways and Thomas Cook Airlines, the figures are 79% and 81.1% 
respectively. At regional operators women make up 81.7% of Flybe's lowest earners, 84.1% of Eastern Airways' 
and 54.3% of Loganair's.
Companies were also required to submit data on bonus pay. In terms of who received bonuses, nearly all carriers 
reported either parity or women ahead of men. In terms of the value of those bonuses, however, the money 
received by women was below the amount awarded to men in nearly all cases.

RYANAIR has reported an average gender pay gap for its British-based staff of 67 per cent, the widest among large 
airlines that have had to disclose the difference in earnings under new regulations.
British-based employers are under heightened scrutiny over their pay structures and companies with more than 250 
staff have to report their gender pay gap by today to the Government Equalities Office.
Compared with other airlines that operate in the UK, Ryanair's mean pay gap outstripped low-cost rival Easyjet, 
where it stood at 51.7 per cent, and British Airways, where it was 35 per cent.
The aviation industry has a particular issue with gender equality as the vast majority of pilots are men.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, said only eight out of its 554 pilots based in the UK are women.
A majority of its 1,182 UK staff that are classified as being in either the lower middle or lower wage band are also 
women, Ryanair said.
Ryanair, whose largest base is at London's Stansted Airport, employs just under 10 per cent of its staff in the UK.
Its management and administration staff are largely based in its home market of Ireland.
"Like all airlines, our gender pay in the UK is materially affected by the relatively low numbers of female pilots in the 
aviation industry," Ryanair said in a presentation of the data published on its website.
"In recent years, the number of female pilots applying to Ryanair has increased and we are committed to 
developing this welcome trend.
Ryanair gender pay gap widest among airlines
"It is a feature of the aviation industry that more males than females choose to enter the pilot profession," the airline 
added.

What's the biggest problem with flying from Cardiff or Southampton airport? Apart from finding you have a return 
ticket? It's that there are plenty of aircraft, but not enough snow ploughs.
For regional airline Flybe, the latter meant hundreds of cancellations in February and March, as ground crews 
struggled with icy conditions brought on by the Siberian "Beast From the East". Across the UK, Flybe had to cancel 
994 flights in the quarter to March 31, incurring a £4m hit to revenue that will cut full-year profit.
But it is arguably the former that is the bigger issue, as Flybe still had plenty of aircraft taking off - so many, in fact, 
that its flights were not even three-quarters full. In the three-month period, its passenger load factor was 6.8 
percentage points higher than a year ago, but still no more than 73.5 per cent. By contrast, Ryanair's load factor in 
its last reported quarter was 96 per cent, easyJet's was 92.1 per cent, and Wizz Air's was 89.4 per cent.
Of course, purely regional airlines will always operate with lower load factors, partly because they fly to Cardiff and 
Southampton rather than Corfu and the South of France. They can also afford to, as they operate cheaper 
turboprop aircraft that breakeven on lower passenger numbers. Even so, Flybe needs to cut capacity by more than 
the 6 per cent it achieved in the past three months. Overambition in the past has left it with too many jets allocated 
to marginal routes. Six aircraft are being returned at the end of their leases but, with new orders having only now 
stopped, the fleet shrinks by just four, to 79.
Progress will continue to be slow, even though Flybe also owns aircraft that it could sell. In many cases, waiting for 
lease expiry remains a more cost-effective option than selling newer aircraft on attractive financing deals.
Flybe: snow joke; UK COMPANIES
Passengers have had to get used to waiting. But can shareholders? At least Flybe's largest backer appears to be 
prepared for the short-haul long haul: it's Hosking Partners - the investment boutique set up by the co-founder of 
the fund manager ... Marathon.

Ryanair cancels 20 Portuguese flights as cabin crews strike
Ryanair cancels 20 Portuguese flights as cabin crews strike

Ryanair cancelled at least 20 flights to and from airports in Portugal on Thursday on the first of three days of 
planned strikes by a cabin crew union, according to flight information on the airline's web site.
The airline, Europe's largest low-cost carrier with around 2,000 flights per day, has never experienced major 
disruption due to strikes.
But after recognising trade unions for the first time in its 30-year history in December to avoid mass Christmas 
strikes, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the airline was prepared for smaller localised action this year.
Portugal's SNPVAC union last week confirmed plans to hold strikes on March 29, April 1 and April 4, saying 
management had failed to meet their demands on working conditions.
Union representatives say the strikes were motivated by below-par labour conditions, including disciplinary 
processes and threats for not reaching in-flight sales objectives.
They also accuse the company of ignoring basic parenthood rights and not allowing doctor-approved sick days.
Ryanair says staff working conditions are comparable to competitors. It has accused union members from 
competitor airlines such as TAP and easyJet of organising the strike to disrupt its operations, a charge the union 
has rejected.
Ryanair said in a statement there had been a small number of cancellations on Thursday due to the strike, which it 
described as "unnecessary and unjustified."
Ryanair cancels 20 Portuguese flights as cabin crews strike
Data on its web site showed 20 flights had been cancelled, 14 of them to or from Porto airport.
Ryanair flew additional flights on Thursday for disrupted passengers and is planning additional flights on Friday 
morning, the statement said. The majority of Portuguese crews worked as normal on Thursday, it said. (Reuters)

Upping the Ante : Mullins set to break his duck at Fairyhouse

Highlight: Champion trainer Willie Mullins has never won the Irish Grand National. Is that about to change? 
Body
During the first series of acclaimed Netflix hit The Crown, a young Queen Elizabeth II, fretting about a banquet at 
which US president Dwight Eisenhower is to be guest of honour, calls in Professor Hogg.
The “ever unconventional” educationalist briefs the queen on the essentials of what she needs to know: out of her 
depth on wider political developments, she is weary of channelling conversations to subjects she is comfortable 
discussing. Such as horses.
The professor requests 24 hours to study Eisenhower’s hobbies and interests, before revealing as he departs that 
he had backed the Grand National winner (name the year to feel smug come the end of the column).
“I had Early Mist on an each-way bet,” he nonchalantly tells the queen.
“Oh well done you – he won by 20 lengths! I share your admiration for Mr O’Brien and everything he is doing at 
Ballydoyle stables.”
The erudite gentleman is lost: “Who?”
“The trainer . . . That’s not why you backed him.”
“No,” Hogg admits. “I just like the name.”
The O’Brien of whom the queen was such a fan was not Aidan – though, no doubt she admires the modern-day 
king of Ballydoyle – but Vincent, who passed away in 2009.
A man of few words from rural Co Cork, O’Brien was voted the greatest influence in horse-racing history in a 
worldwide poll in the Racing Post in 2003.
Upping the Ante : Mullins set to break his duck at Fairyhouse
Vincent, or ‘MV’ as he was also known, won the Grand National three times in succession with three different 
horses, the first of whom was Early Mist.
It thus seems staggering he managed just one success in the Irish Grand National: Alberoni in 1952.
Between 1952 and 2010, when I had the honour of owning half a leg of one of the runners in the Irish Grand 
National, the race changed little enough. However, it has since become a more elite event. The purse is a whopping 
€500,000.
Gordon Elliott aims to run a dozen horses in the race. Last year, his main owner Michael O’Leary needed 13 
different caps.
Last week, Tony Mullins, brother of champion trainer Willie, sniped about how few trainers had entries in today’s 
Grade One Ryanair Gold Cup, consistent with an interview he gave in January to the Irish Field.
“The opportunities are there in jumping, but they’re being taken by the two powerhouses,” he said then, referring to 
O’Leary and JP McManus.
“I am seriously against these two sets of colours being allowed to run ten apiece in the [big handicap chases]. I 
think it’s absolutely ruining the game at a phenomenal speed.
“This thing of completely obliterating the Irish National last year was an absolute circus. Horses that pulled up 
shortly after halfway; they’d absolutely no chance. Their only purpose there was to keep other horses out.”
Mullins’s comments predictably grated in some circles, though many would have agreed with him and bemoaned 
the way the jumps game is going in this country, even if it is producing better quality and quantity than before.
Two men have established a dominance akin to Celtic and Rangers: Willie Mullins and Gordon Elliott. Yet, in one of 
the greatest anomalies in the sport, neither trainer has won the Irish Grand National. Expect that to change 
tomorrow at Fairyhouse, when Mullins sends out Bellshill and Pairofbrowneyes.
Elliott has the quantity as he bids for a crucial victory in his quest to win the trainers’ title for the first time, but 
Mullins arguably has the quality. Pairofbrowneyes’s claims are so pressing that, even in a field of 30, his odds of 8/1 
are worth taking.
His former trainer, Barry Murphy, has saddled a single winner from 82 runners in the past five seasons; it was to be 
expected that the steed would improve under Mullins, for whom he bolted up on his first start last month at Gowran 
Park.
A penalty ought not stop him tomorrow, even if one expects more finishers than the mere quartet who chased home 
Professor Hogg’s selection - which, as you may have known, was in 1953.

With just a year to go before the UK is scheduled to formally leave the European Union, the reality of what this will 
mean for airlines with significant British operations or ownership is still far from clear.
In some quarters there is still scepticism – be it wishful thinking or grounded in the sheer complexity of the task – 
over whether the UK will actually leave the EU at the end of March 2019, despite the invocation of the Article 50 
withdrawal clause.
Europe's airlines have all called for clarity, citing the importance of the operating environment for businesses that 
are already plotting their summer schedules for 2019 and beyond.
Predictably, given the political posturing and gamesmanship inherent in negotiations, such clarity has not been 
forthcoming. Airlines enter the last year of full UK membership of the EU with little confirmation of the operating 
environment to come.
That has left the field open for widely differing views of how damaging the impact might be for the airline sector.
"I'm a firm believer that this will get resolved," IAG chief executive Willie Walsh said during the Airlines for Europe 
(A4E) Aviation Summit in Brussels on 6 March. "There's no better industry at dealing with disruption than ours [and] 
there's not a lot that needs to be sorted out."
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary paints a different picture. "I think there is going to be a real crisis," he 
asserts. "I believe there will be disruption in flights between the UK and Europe. I think partly because it is in the 
German and French interests to push the ownership issue to the maximum extent."
ANALYSIS: How airlines have readied for Brexit; With just a year to go before the UK is scheduled to formally 
leave the European Union, the reality of what this....
Speaking to FlightGlobal at the same A4E summit, European Commission director-general for mobility and 
transport Henrik Hololei sounded a warning on the challenges of securing a UK-EU aviation agreement.
He says that discussions regarding a future aviation agreement between the UK and EU must await the progress of 
the wider framework for the negotiations between the parties. "The whole nature of these discussions is that there 
are no sectoral negotiations without a general framework in place and there is no cherry-picking as we know," 
Hololei notes.
That debate came before the striking in March of a transition deal between the UK and the EU, which settled some 
of the nerves around the March 2019 deadline. This has brought more positive noises from UK and EU leaders 
about the tone of future negotiations, as they embark on talks to reach some kind of agreement on future relations 
by October 2018.
Hololei himself earlier suggested that, if a transition agreement could be agreed, the UK's current access to 
European air markets could be extended for as long as that transition period lasts.
COMPLICATING FACTORS
The UK's departure – or that of any other major European country – from the EU is complicated for airlines to 
unpick because of the consolidation among EU operators and the pan-European expansion of low-cost carriers 
over recent years. There are UK carriers with prominent intra-EU operations, and vice versa.
Theoretically, the early securing of a new EU-UK aviation deal would help provide the regulatory framework to 
support the status quo of such operations. But with no guarantee of such an agreement, let alone it being agreed 
before wider Brexit terms are sealed, many carriers have taken steps to safeguard their operations from a failure to 
agree an orderly transition or the implementation of a "hard" Brexit.
They have done so largely by working to ensure they have air operator certificates and relevant foreign ownership 
levels in place to secure the necessary route rights.
EASYJET
London Luton-headquartered EasyJet, with its mix of UK and intra-European operations, has arguably had the most 
at stake and was among the first to take action when it applied last summer for an Austrian AOC to safeguard its 
non-UK European route network. It established a Vienna-based European division which conducted its first flights in 
July 2017. By December, this division had grown to 25 Airbus A320s and three A319s.
EasyJet already has a Swiss AOC to fly routes from Switzerland, which is not part of the EU. It has also established 
a new company for UK operations.
It says: "EasyJet is now – and will be after the UK leaves the EU – a pan-European airline group with three airlines 
based in Austria, Switzerland and the UK, together with a commercial and operational services company based in 
Luton."
The airline has also acted to enshrine, in its articles of association, that the company will remain EU-owned and -
controlled after Brexit. Shareholders in February backed a motion designed to ensure the airline remains able to fly 
between and within EU countries. At the time, chairman John Barton said the airline was close to having 50% of 
shares held by non-UK European Economic Area nationals.
WIZZ AIR
Central European budget carrier Wizz Air has applied for a UK AOC, as it continues to build its operations in the 
country.
ANALYSIS: How airlines have readied for Brexit; With just a year to go before the UK is scheduled to formally 
leave the European Union, the reality of what this....
"This move is also part of our broader strategy to ensure that our UK operations are [post-EU membership] ready," 
explained Wizz chief executive Jozsef Varadi in confirming the AOC application last October. But he adds the AOC 
is "not only for Brexit", but also to position Wizz to "take advantage" of potential consolidation opportunities.
Wizz has doubled its UK capacity in the last four years. Luton airport, where Wizz acquired former Monarch Airlines 
slots from administrators, is the carrier's biggest station by seat capacity.
In June last year the carrier said it was monitoring its ownership status. But it is "not taking actions at this point in 
time", says Varadi.
RYANAIR
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has been at the forefront of warnings that flights between the UK and 
mainland Europe could be disrupted by Brexit.
The Irish carrier said it halved its growth plans in the UK in 2017 to around 6% following the referendum result and 
could further reduce or redeploy its aircraft based in the country after Brexit. It also says it will add a Brexit clause to 
tickets sold for flights after March 2019 to cover itself legally if services are disrupted.
The airline is also acquiring a UK AOC to ensure it retains domestic route rights. UK operations, spanning six routes 
this summer, represent a relatively small part of Ryanair's activities.
It has also outlined the need to tackle its foreign ownership levels. Ownership limits would be breached once UK 
shareholders are classified as non-EU.
O'Leary previously estimated that about 60-65% of Ryanair's shareholding would be non-EU after Brexit. "I do not 
see that as an issue because we actively want to buy back our shares," he said last September. "I might even force 
UK sellers to sell my shares to me. I will be the buyer."
Ryanair has undertaken a number of share buyback schemes in recent years including a 750 million ($934 million) 
buyback in February.
IAG
With its Spanish corporate domicile – and with AOCs and airlines based in Spain, the UK, Ireland and France – IAG 
has steadfastly maintained that its pan-European structure means it is well-set for Brexit.
Chief executive Willie Walsh said in November 2016 that IAG's ownership model had been tested with its creation 
in 2011 and had proven "robust”. Speaking at the A4E summit in March, Walsh noted: "I have a European 
company. And the EU must be acting in my interests as a European company. And I'm sure they will. And the idea 
that Aer Lingus is not an Irish company or Iberia is not a Spanish company is just nonsense – they are."
IAG would be exposed to risk if fifth-freedom rights between the EU and UK were altered as it operates domestic 
flights within the UK, intra-European flights, and services from the UK to the rest of the EU.
Walsh has called for a comprehensive air transport agreement that would give airlines from the UK and the 27 
remaining EU member nations "all the freedoms of the air" post-Brexit.
Further complication appears to lie in marrying ownership requirements to ensure IAG meets EU ownership rules, 
but also in a future UK deal on transatlantic flights.
British Airways' home country relies on its EU membership for its right to serve US routes, under the wider EU-US 
aviation deal. Initial talks have already taken place and, after reports that the USA was offering only a standard 
aviation deal which would require UK carriers to be majority UK-owned, Walsh expressed confidence that a new 
deal would be reached.

"There will be an agreement between the UK and the [USA]. That will be a comprehensive open-skies agreement," 
he says. "Anybody who doesn't believe that is living in cloud cuckoo land."
IAG declines to break down the nationality of its shareholders. Its largest single shareholder is Qatar Airways.
VIRGIN ATLANTIC AND NORWEGIAN
Both Norwegian and Virgin Atlantic would also likely be impacted should UK ownership become an issue. The two 
carriers are the biggest European operators behind British Airways in terms of UK-US capacity, FlightGlobal 
schedules data shows.
Virgin Atlantic holds a UK AOC. The airline is 49% owned by Delta Air Lines and the rest is held by the Virgin 
Group. But under a deal struck last summer, Delta partner Air France-KLM will acquire 31% stake in Virgin Atlantic. 
Richard Branson's Virgin Group would then hold a 20% stake.
Craig Kreeger, Virgin Atlantic's chief executive, has described as "hazardous guessing" the suggestion that the deal 
could be imperilled by ownership laws if the UK is designated a third country. But he says the various parties can 
"adjust as necessary if it needs to be adjusted".
Kreeger has highlighted the need for a liberal UK-US open skies agreement to replace the UK's current access to 
US markets via the EU-US open skies.
Norwegian is the third-largest operator on US-UK routes, which it flies largely under the UK AOC it set up in 2016.
That could add a further dimension to UK-US negotiations if the USA demands more stringent labour practices in 
any future UK-US open-skies successor, given the controversy that was ignited in the USA when Norwegian 
applied for a foreign air carrier permit there.
This was evident in the protracted application for US route authority for its Irish operation amid US labour group 
arguments that Norwegian was using it as a "flag of convenience" to operate with lower labour costs. US route 
rights for its Irish operation were finally secured in December 2016, and followed for its UK arm in the autumn of 
2017.
Norwegian has multiple AOCs, in part reflecting its home country's non-EU status, and relies on bilateral freedoms 
for the rights to operate its European, US and Asian flights.
Chief executive Bjorn Kjos has previously expressed confidence that the UK and EU can come to a "suitable 
arrangement to allow air services to continue".
OTHER PLAYERS
BMI Regional operates UK domestic, UK-EU and intra-European routes, and notably has a Munich base. The 
airline is majority UK-owned and holds a UK AOC.
Its commercial chief Jochen Schnadt said in November 2017 that the airline would either need a European AOC or 
to enter a joint venture with a European partner to safeguard its intra-European route network.
Leisure carrier Thomas Cook Airlines holds AOCs in the UK, Germany, Spain and Scandinavia.
In February, Thomas Cook's chief airlines officer Christoph Debus said that only 34% of shares in the group were 
held by non-European investors, but "we would expect this to rise above 50%" if the UK became a third country. 
Debus says he is "hopeful" a solution can be found, and suggests that Thomas Cook might need to find "different 
legal structure in order to be able to operate our airlines going forward".
The UK-based tour operator is including a "Brexit clause" in the terms and conditions of tickets sold for flights after 
March 2019.
ANALYSIS: How airlines have readied for Brexit; With just a year to go before the UK is scheduled to formally 
leave the European Union, the reality of what this....
Europe's other major travel group TUI has five AOCs, including a UK one.
Leisure carrier Jet2 operates from UK bases into Europe, with no intra-European operations. Corporate parent Dart 
Group last summer adjusted its articles of association to restrict non-UK ownership to a maximum 35%. But it 
believed non-UK ownership was below that level, part of efforts to ensure retention of route rights.
At the time, the impact on Jet2's ownership rights was not known, and Jet2 said it might be necessary to "review 
such provisions when the regulatory landscape following Brexit becomes clearer".
For UK regional carrier Flybe, the impact has largely been from the weakening of UK currency, evident in its first-
half results.
Its network is overwhelmingly UK-EU. Chief executive Christine Ourmieres-Widener told FlightGlobal a year ago 
that the addition of a European AOC was "not on the table" because only a "very limited number" of continental 
European routes were being operated.
Flybe's white-label operations could be disrupted if new leasing rules are introduced.
NON-EU AIRLINES
Malaysia Airlines' former chief executive Peter Bellew believes the "messy" situation caused by Brexit is prompting 
non-European airlines to rethink their strategies around which secondary airports to serve in the region.
"I think that's the first casualty [for the UK] that's happening with Brexit," said Bellew during a conference at the 
European Parliament in Brussels on 20 March.
Bellew, who is now Ryanair's chief operations officer, says he knows from talking to executives in Asia that "they 
don't understand the Brexit thing", adding: "And you know what? They don't really want to understand it. They just 
know there's something messy out there."
That perception means, he says, that carriers are more likely to fly from "Beijing or Xi'an or Xiamen to Brussels" if 
such services are "less hassle and less risky" than those to Birmingham, Manchester, Edinburgh or Newcastle.
Bellew adds: "And that's actually very important. If you're talking [about achieving] economic generation in the 
peripheral regions of Europe, you're talking about [having] Asia or [US] inbound [traffic]."

Since 52% of voters opted for Brexit nearly two years ago, the UK's government and regulators have been beset by 
multiple headaches.
For airlines and air connectivity, as in many other areas, the consequences of the referendum verdict were never 
close to the mainstream narrative in the run-up to the referendum. It is no surprise, therefore, that the solutions 
being discussed one year before the UK is due to leave the EU are focused on maintaining the status quo, at best.
Take as an example the UK's membership of the European Common Aviation Area, which grants carriers the 
freedom to fly into and out of member states, and between other countries in the bloc.
Even if the Brexit eventually negotiated is "soft" and the UK agrees comprehensive access to the ECAA – perhaps 
through a Swiss-style bilateral agreement – a huge airline market would no longer be involved in the bloc's political 
process. The UK would counterintuitively abandon its ability to influence decisions, and the EU would lose heft in 
the global aviation scene. Both parties would be facing a more complicated operational picture.
So while European airline chiefs have disparate opinions on how smooth Brexit is likely to be – from Ryanair chief 
Michael O'Leary's view that there will be significant disruption to services, through to IAG head Willie Walsh's calm 
confidence that everything will work itself out – it is noticeable that none of them are citing any positives that will 
come from Brexit.
That reflects the reality that the EU's open skies and relatively liberal ownership rules are hard-won and remain the 
stuff of dreams in other regions. There are no "better" options available to states wanting to go it alone.
AirAsia, for example, has long voiced frustrations about needing to operate multiple entities in an attempt to create 
a pan-Asia carrier. Conversely, carriers such as EasyJet and Ryanair have flourished in the EU, fighting the old 
guard, driving down fares and challenging outdated notions of countries maintaining control of "national" carriers.
E OPINION: Brexit offers no upsides to airlines or passengers Since 52% of voters opted for Brexit nearly two 
years ago, the UK's government and regulators have....
Indeed, the UK itself plays host to an aviation powerhouse in EasyJet – a budget carrier and industry disruptor 
which has embraced the freedoms offered by the EU to develop a network featuring many services that do not even 
touch its home country's soil.
For now, at least, EasyJet is maintaining its status as a UK-based airline group, but with its new air operator's 
certificate in Austria, more of its flights are being operated by an EU-based entity to mitigate the risk of contravening 
the bloc's ownership rules.
To ensure success post-Brexit, the UK's airlines are having to make sure they aren't too British. Brexit's champions 
will be hoping that this trend is unique to airlines.
For non-UK carriers with significant connectivity to the country, meanwhile, Brexit only presents the risk of barriers 
and complication. KLM, which feeds its mainline services from 14 UK airports, is a case in point.
Airlines and their customers have also been able to enjoy Europe's relatively relaxed borders. Today, the UK 
government's intransigence on ending free movement of people and labour when it leaves the EU is only likely to 
make it harder to travel to and from the country – affecting its own citizens and those of other EU states. Here there 
might be some upside for the EU, potentially making it better placed to attract long-haul connectivity than the UK, 
but few businesses would see barriers as a good thing in the long run.
Those forecasting some kind of Brexit boost for UK businesses and consumers might therefore steer away from 
airlines and air connectivity in their hunt for good-news stories. The EU, meanwhile, might cite these areas as 
showing why leaving the bloc is a bad idea.
The UK and – through no fault of its own – the EU might soon look back and realise they never had it so good.

RYANAIR cannot rule out flight cancellations due to a planned cabin crew strike in Portugal during the Easter 
holidays but expects any disruptions to be small, its chief executive said at a news conference in Vienna yesterday.
Portuguese union representatives have said the strikes are motivated by below-par labour conditions, including 
disciplinary processes and threats for not reaching in-flight sales objectives.
Asked whether there will be flight cancellations, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary, who was in Vienna to 
promote the Laudamotion cooperation, said: "It depends on how many disruptions there are. We can't rule it out but 
it will be small scale".
Ryanair has scheduled 90 flights to and from Portugal for today, he said.
Ryanair has had strained relations with its staff lately and was forced to recognise trade unions for the first time to 
avoid mass Christmas strikes in December.

Some Ryanair cabin crew in Portugal will go ahead with one-day strikes during the Easter holidays after Europe's 
largest low-cost carrier failed to meet their demands on working conditions, the SNPVAC union said on Tuesday.
The strikes by unionised cabin crew were set for March 29, April 1 and April 4. The union said it was still in 
Ryanair's hands to avoid the walkout.
The airline said it did not expect a lot of crew to join the walkout but disruptions were possible.
"The talks with the company have been fruitless as Ryanair refuses to apply the Portuguese law, recognise the 
rights that the Portuguese constitution gives to its citizens," the union said in a statement, also criticising the 
Portuguese government for doing nothing to defend its union members' rights.
Union representatives say the strikes were motivated by below-par labour conditions, including disciplinary 
processes and threats for not reaching in-flight sales objectives. They also accuse the company of ignoring basic 
parenthood rights and not allowing doctor-approved sick days.
"We demand respect because it is granted by law... the cabin crews demand their basic rights and not even the vile 
threat of shutting the Portuguese hubs scares us," the union said.
In a statement, Ryanair called the strike threat "entirely unnecessary" after it sent the union a signed recognition 
agreement and agreed to meet with SNPVAC representatives in Dublin on April 9.
Ryanair argues that the strike is organised by union members from competitor airlines such as TAP and easyJet to 
disrupt its operations.
Ryanair 's Portugal cabin crews to go ahead with Easter strikes
Ryanair has had strained relations with its staff lately and was forced to recognise trade unions for the first time to 
avoid mass Christmas strikes in December.
Unions representing Ryanair pilots across Europe signed a deal earlier this month to cooperate in a move that 
could raise the prospect of coordinated action, something the airline's management has been keen to avoid.

New Austrian carrier Laudamotion aims for a top spot among Europe's budget airlines, Ryanair chief executive 
Michael O'Leary announced Wednesday in Vienna.
Irish budget carrier Ryanair owns 24.9 per cent of Laudamotion and plans to increase its stake to 75 per cent soon.
O'Leary told a press conference that Laudamotion's fleet should double to 40 aircraft within two or three years.
The Vienna-based airline is the successor of Niki, the subsidiary of failed German carrier Air Berlin.
Laudamotion flies from seven German airports as well as Vienna and Zurich to vacation destinations in southern 
Europe.
O'Leary expects the new airline to make losses in it first two years.
"We hope to make money in the third year," he said.
Former Formula One champion and entrepreneur Niki Lauda, who heads Laudamotion, strongly denied allegations 
that he had merely acted as a frontman for others when he bought Niki.
Ryanair's investment was announced on March 20, only weeks after Lauda won the bid for Niki. In addition to the 
deal with Ryanair, Lauda has decided to lease several of his aircraft to German carrier Lufthansa at least until the 
end of May.
"I do not comment on stupid comments. We are an Austrian firm and a European airline," he said.
Laudamotion aims to become key player among Europe's budget airlines
Lauda founded Niki in 2003. After selling it to the Air Berlin group in 2011, he bought it back in January and 
renamed it Laudamotion.

Laudamotion will open a new base and operate 17 routes from Berlin Tegel this summer as part of its co-operation 
with new investor Ryanair.
The Austrian carrier, which is based on the now-defunct Niki operation, will from 1 June station four aircraft in the 
German capital.
Eight of the 17 destinations are in Spain: Barcelona, Fuerteventura, Ibiza, Lanzarote, Las Palmas, Malaga, Palma 
de Mallorca and Tenerife. Four are in Greece: Corfu, Heraklion, Kos and Rhodes.
Faro in Portugal is also on the list, along with two destinations in Croatia (Pula and Rijeka) and two in Italy (Brindisi 
and Milan Malpensa).
Laudamotion had already indicated that it would operate from Tegel to Palma de Mallorca, as part of initial network 
plans disclosed earlier this month, though the route is not yet available in its booking engine.
FlightGlobal schedules data indicates that Laudamotion will compete with Eurowings on the routes to Barcelona, 
Faro, Heraklion, Palma de Mallorca and Rijeka.
Germania and TUIfly will both be rivals to Laudamotion on four of the routes: Fuerteventura, Las Palmas, Rhodes 
and Tenerife. Germania also operates the Lanzarote route.
On the routes to Brindisi, Corfu, Milan Mapensa, Palma de Mallorca and Pula, Laudamotion will compete with 
EasyJet.
The Austrian carrier will challenge Vueling on Tegel-Barcelona and Aegean Airlines on Tegel-Heraklion. That Greek 
route will also be operated by German leisure carrier Sundair, which will also fly to Kos and Rhodes from Tegel.
Laudamotion to launch Tegel base amid intensifying competition Laudamotion will open a new base and 
operate 17 routes from Berlin Tegel this summer as part of i....
Laudaomotion will compete directly with Ryanair on the route to Palma de Mallorca, the Irish carrier having just 
announced plans to begin its first service from Tegel over the summer.
The Austrian company – controlled by former Formula 1 racing driver and aviation entrepreneur Niki Lauda – 
acquired assets from Niki's administrators in January. An initial deal for Lufthansa to acquire Niki had fallen through 
amid competition concerns.
Ryanair earlier this month agreed to acquire 75% of Laudamotion for 50 million ($62 million). The Irish budget 
carrier says it will initially buy a 24.9% stake and plans to increase it to 75% subject to EU competition approval
Niki had last summer operated 13 routes out of Tegel, the bulk of which have now been picked up by Laudamotion.
Ryanair and EasyJet are both long present in Berlin, operating out of the city's Schonefeld airport. Now, both – 
albeit indirectly through Laudamotion, in the case of Ryanair – have a presence at Tegel.
EasyJet began Tegel operations in January after successfully bidding for assets from Air Berlin's administrators, 
and has today announced the addition of five points to its Tegel network: Alghero, Bari and Olbia in Italy, Danish 
airport Aarhus, and Czech capital Prague.
The UK low-cost carrier will also switch some of its Schonefeld flights from three of its key business destinations, 
London Gatwick, Edinburgh and Paris Orly, to begin Tegel services.
"Our Berlin summer schedule is selling well and the ramp-up of the operation is going as planned," states EasyJet's 
country director for Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Thomas Haagensen. That expansion also includes 
additional frequencies on the German domestic routes it began this year, including flights to Dusseldorf, Frankfurt 
and Munich.
The disclosure of Laudamotion's Tegel plans comes after the airline had earlier in March outlined plans for routes 
from Germany, Austria and Switzerland, predominantly to southern European leisure destinations.
Laudamotion will deploy six aircraft at Dusseldorf and one each in Cologne, Frankfurt, Munich, Nuremberg and 
Stuttgart.
The carrier will base four aircraft in Vienna this summer and could increase this by another three over the winter as 
part of a "focus on a city shuttle service" from the Austrian capital. Two aircraft will be based at Zurich.

Few airline markets have shown as much movement as Germany over the past year, amid the jockeying for 
position that accompanied first the attempts to save Air Berlin and subsequently the backfilling of capacity the 
Oneworld carrier vacated.
The fragmented nature of Air Berlin's model, established through a series of acquisitions, means its fall has rippled 
across various market segments – and beyond Germany. Notably, the fate of Austrian unit Niki has had its twists 
and turns: in the latest, Ryanair acquired a stake in successor operation Laudamotion, which has just begun flights.
Lufthansa had already begun working with Air Berlin via a major wet-lease arrangement as the latter sought to 
offload short-haul capacity, while a mooted consolidation in the leisure sector involving Etihad, Niki and TUIfly failed 
to materialise.
After Abu Dhabi's Etihad pulled the plug on further investment in Air Berlin, the German carrier initiated insolvency 
proceedings last summer, sparking the break-up of the group. That has led Lufthansa to further expand its 
Eurowings offering, while EasyJet began Berlin Tegel flights and Niki Lauda made a return to aviation.
Overall short-haul capacity in Germany – defined as flights within the European Economic Area and Switzerland – 
is set to climb slightly over the summer. FlightGlobal schedules data for April-September shows seat capacity rising 
by around 2%. That is lower than the 4% growth last summer, though, and the more than 7% increase in the 
summer of 2016 – a year in which Ryanair expanded rapidly in the German market.
Air Berlin, together with Niki, had its largest presence at Tegel and Dusseldorf airport, accounting for more than half 
of its short-haul capacity last summer.
ANALYSIS: Airlines jockey for position after Air Berlin's fall Few airline markets have shown as much 
movement as Germany over the past year, amid the jockeying....
BERLIN OPENING
The largest chunk of that capacity has been taken up by EasyJet. The UK budget carrier began operations at Tegel 
in January after completing a deal to acquire assets including aircraft and airport slots from Air Berlin 
administrators.
For a cost of 40 million ($53 million), EasyJet agreed to lease up to 25 ex-Air Berlin Airbus A320s for operations 
from Tegel, recruit 1,000 flightcrew formerly with the Oneworld member, and acquire other assets including the 
slots.
Speaking in November, EasyJet finance chief Andrew Findlay said that while the airline's Tegel operation would 
create a £60 million ($85 million) "headline" cost in 2018, it would become "earnings accretive" in 2019 and 
represent "attractive financial returns" in the long run, given the airport's strategic market position.
EasyJet, which had already been active at Berlin Schonefeld airport, is now the biggest operator at Tegel. EasyJet 
is, together with Ryanair, already the biggest operator on European routes from Schonefeld. It will lift seat capacity 
3% in this segment this summer.
Eurowings is the other big mover – even accounting for capacity formerly operated under the Germanwings name. 
Factoring in Lufthansa mainline plus siblings Austrian Airlines and Swiss – all of which will operate increased 
capacity this summer – makes Lufthansa Group the biggest overall operator on short-haul European routes from 
Tegel.
Air Berlin had already operated some capacity for Eurowings under a wet-lease agreement. Eurowings capacity at 
Tegel has been boosted by its acquisition of German regional carrier LGW from Air Berlin's administrators.
EasyJet has launched 10 new Tegel routes not previously served from the airport. These include four Spanish 
routes – Alicante, Granada, Jerez and Menorca – as well as Ancona, Brindisi and Genoa in Italy. It has just 
disclosed plans to add eight new routes from Tegel, three of which - London Gatwick, Edinburgh and Paris Orly - 
involve switching some of its Schonefeld flights to Tegel.
EasyJet also launched its first German domestic flights, operating to Cologne, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich and 
Stuttgart from Tegel.
Speaking at the recent Connect event in Tbilisi, Johannes Mohrmann – senior manager key account and business 
development at Berlin Brandenburg airport – noted: "Last year, when Air Berlin stopped service, there was only 
Eurowings left, basically, in the domestic market. We also saw prices going up significantly, but now we are in the 
lucky position that EasyJet is serving all the major domestic destinations from Berlin on a high-frequency basis. It 
worked out quite well for us."
Overall seat capacity this summer from Tegel is roughly unchanged, but with fewer flights.
That is before a series of flights announced on 28 March by Laudamotion and Ryanair to be operated by the former 
from Tegel. Laudamotion will station four aircraft in Berlin from the start of June to operate 17 routes from Tegel - 
largely drawn from former Niki destinations - and including eight Spanish routes.
Air Berlin and Niki between them marketed around 50 routes out of Tegel last summer. Following Laudamotion's 
announcement it will serve Ibiza and Malaga, as well EasyJet's plan to begin Prague services - it leaves only 
Gdansk, Krakow and Milan Linate which will be unserved this summer from Tegel. Ryanair though now serves both 
Polish routes from Schonefeld, while Laudamotion will join EasyJet in operating a Milan Malpensa service from 
Tegel this summer.
DUSSELDORF
Short-haul European capacity at Dusseldorf is set be down more than 10% year-on-year this summer.
ANALYSIS: Airlines jockey for position after Air Berlin's fall Few airline markets have shown as much 
movement as Germany over the past year, amid the jockeying....
Air Berlin and Niki last summer operated around 40 Dusseldorf routes, most of which had one or more carriers on 
them.
Of the routes where either was the sole operator, Eurowings has taken over Ponta Delgada in the Azores and 
Samos in Greece from Niki, and Salzburg and Stuttgart from Air Berlin. Only Bologna, Florence and Innsbruck have 
not been picked up from Dusseldorf.
Eurowings has made the most gains at the airport, and is comfortably the largest operator from Dusseldorf. But 
Lufthansa and Condor will also increase their capacity from the German hub this summer. The latter is expanding 
after its parent, Thomas Cook, acquired assets from the Air Berlin Aviation subsidiary.
While EasyJet and Ryanair lead the way in terms of seat capacity from Berlin overall, neither has made significant 
inroads at Dusseldorf.
EasyJet has taken on the Tegel-Dusseldorf route formerly operated by Air Berlin – a route on which Eurowings has 
also added capacity.
Ryanair this summer begins its first services from Dusseldorf and Tegel by starting flights to Palma de Mallorca.
NIKI MARKETS
Ryanair was a vocal critic of the deal allowing Lufthansa to acquire assets from Air Berlin. The Irish carrier's chief 
executive Michael O'Leary, speaking in Brussels in early March, returned to this theme. He said Ryanair wanted to 
grow in Germany, but that it was "very hard to base more aircraft in those airports, because you have Lufthansa 
[and its ex-Air Berlin slots] and Eurowings sitting there like bed-blockers, blocking all the morning slots".
Lufthansa did not get everything its own way with the regulators, however – failing to secure approval for a deal to 
acquire Niki in Austria. And ultimately, once IAG's bid for the carrier had been rejected after court rulings prompted 
the reopening of the insolvency process, Ryanair ended up acquiring the carrier by striking a deal with the 
successful bidder – Niki Lauda.
Laudamotion – a company controlled by Niki founder Lauda – acquired assets from the carrier at the start of March. 
It has since disclosed plans to serve Palma de Mallorca from a dozen points – including Cologne, Dusseldorf, 
Frankfurt, Hannover and Stuttgart – as well as services from Dusseldorf to Ibiza and Malaga.
Thomas Cook subsidiary Condor had earlier reached an agreement to market Laudamotion's planned flights from 
Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Basel to Majorca, Ibiza and Malaga.
Laudamotion's network, which also includes holiday routes from Basel, Vienna and Zurich, is heavily based on 
routes previously operated by Niki.
Within days of Laudamotion's unveiling of its network plans, Ryanair struck its deal to acquire 75% of the Austrian 
carrier for 50 million. Ryanair will initially buy 24.9% of Laudamotion and plans to increase the stake to 75% subject 
to EU competition approval.
Ryanair will provide another 50 million for "year-one start-up and operating costs", along with "financial and 
management support", and will wet-lease six aircraft to Laudamotion to allow it to complete a 21 aircraft flying 
programme.
"Laudamotion has excellent slots in Palma [and] we've been growing there very rapidly," Ryanair chief operating 
officer Peter Bellew told FlightGlobal at an event in Brussels on 20 March. "Palma itself is growing very quickly. It's 
grown about 20% this year as an airport."
Bellew notes, however, that Ryanair does not currently plan to use Laudamotion's slots at the Spanish island airport 
or elsewhere for its own services.
ANALYSIS: Airlines jockey for position after Air Berlin's fall Few airline markets have shown as much 
movement as Germany over the past year, amid the jockeying....
He cites Ryanair's desire to accelerate growth in Austrian, German and Swiss markets as a key consideration 
behind its desire for a stake in Laudamotion.
"We've also been growing quickly [in the German market]," says Bellew. "We've nearly increased by a third there in 
the last 18 months or so. We feel there's loads of business there."
VIENNA
From Vienna, Laudamotion will in addition to Palma de Mallorca serve Brindisi, Ibiza, Kalamata, Lamezia Terme, 
Malaga, Paphos, Pisa and Santorini.
Austrian remains the biggest operator at Vienna, though, followed by fellow Lufthansa Group operator Eurowings – 
both of which are lifting capacity this summer over last year.
But there are also eye-catching advances being made by European low-cost operators EasyJet, Vueling and Wizz 
Air.
EasyJet, which has chosen Austria for its European air operator's certificate, will almost double seat capacity from 
capital Vienna this summer. That is largely driven by its high-frequency service from Tegel, which it has taken over 
from Air Berlin and operates in competition with Austrian. EasyJet has also added Basel and Milan Malpensa 
services.
Wizz will begin its first services from Vienna this summer, initially operating nine routes from the city. The Hungarian 
carrier only announced Vienna, its first Austrian services, in January. Alongside nine routes being added this winter, 
it has disclosed plans to add a further nine destinations next summer in early March – including its own Malpensa 
service.
Spanish carrier Vueling is also stepping up its presence in Vienna. While it is adding new flights to Palma de 
Mallorca, most of its seat growth comes – in keeping with its wider expansion strategy – through adding extra 
frequency on its Barcelona and Rome Fiumicino routes. Vueling's expansion at Vienna is particularly notable, given 
that it was the planned growth vehicle for IAG. The latter had planned to operate Niki routes via a subsidiary of 
Vueling.
Overall seat capacity at Vienna this summer is set to rise more than 3% compared with 2017.
Note: This article was updated on 28 March to include Berlin Tegel route announcements by EasyJet and 
Laudamotion respectively, but these flights are not yet reflected in the schedules data cited

Highlight: Department warned  any such move could have “unintended consequences” for Ireland
Body
The Department of Business and Enterprise has advised the government against a crackdown on bogus self-
employment, warning that any such move could have “unintended consequences” for Ireland’s international 
competitiveness.
Unions claim abusive labour market practices, where a worker is required by employers to register as a sole trader 
while performing the functions of an employee, are costing the exchequer anywhere from €80 million to €300 million 
a year in lost revenue.
The practice, which allows employers to avoid social insurance payments, is reputed to be rife in the construction 
sector.
In a previously unpublished submission to a public consultation process aimed at addressing these types of tax and 
self-employment concerns, the Department urged the government to take account of “business realities” when 
considering changes to the system.
“In the context of the fierce competition for international talent and investment, particularly in the ICT, pharma and 
specialist engineering sectors, it is important that Ireland has internationally competitive structures that are no less 
flexible than those of our trading partners,” the submission said.
While recognising the need to protect the employment rights of vulnerable workers, the Department urged caution 
in tackling deficiencies in the system. The submission highlighted the potential impact on entrepreneurs, investment 
and the genuinely self-employed.
In a separate submission, Deloitte, the professional services firm, warned tax changes that affected workplace 
flexibility could have “massive” consequences for Ireland’s attractiveness as a hub for multinational corporations.
Government warned against crackdown on self-employed
The consultation process, conducted by the Departments of Finance and Social Protection, fed into a report 
published earlier this year.
Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty said the findings provided government with a “timely and evidence-led 
opportunity to review our social insurance system and to consult with stakeholders”.
The study found certain employment arrangements could result in a “not insignificant tax leakage” which posed a 
risk to the income tax and PRSI base. However it also concluded that the perception of an “increasing prevalence of 
disguised employment may be overestimated”.
Among the 24 contributors to the consultation process were the Ryanair Pilot Group, the Unite trade union, Ibec 
and the Small Firms Association.
According to a study published by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions last December, precarious work is now 
pervasive in Ireland, with 8 per cent of the workforce experiencing significant variations in their weekly working 
hours.

Ryanair to fly 15 routes from European cities to Ukraine
Ryanair to fly 15 routes from European cities to Ukraine

Ireland's Ryanair will launch its first routes from European cities to Ukraine, the low-cost airline said on Friday, 
rekindling a deal it walked away from last July over alleged attempts to protect the market for Ukrainian competitors.
The collapse of the previous agreement highlighted the power of vested interests in Ukraine, where the government 
has vowed to tackle endemic corruption in exchange for a $17.5 billion bailout deal from the International Monetary 
Fund.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary announced the deal at a 
briefing at Kiev's Boryspil airport, which will have 10 Ryanair routes, while the western city of Lviv will have five.
"This is a sign of quality - the quality of the investment climate and the quality of competition conditions," 
Poroshenko said.
Soon after Ryanair cancelled the deal last year, Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman called for talks to be restarted 
and asked Ukraine's anti-corruption and anti-monopoly bodies to examine if the previous negotiations had been 
carried out fairly and in compliance with competition laws.
The authorities have been at pains to show that Ukraine is open for business after the 2013/2014 pro-European 
uprising, but efforts to attract foreign investment have been hampered by lacklustre progress on fighting corruption.
Last year, Ukrainian International Airlines (UIA), which is part-owned by tycoon Ihor Kolomoisky, denied it had been 
lobbying to prevent a deal between Ryanair and Boryspil airport.
Ryanair to fly 15 routes from European cities to Ukraine
The new agreement will likely be welcomed by many within Ukraine as it will provide more and cheaper routes to 
European destinations at a time when a new visa-free regime with the European Union has simplified travel for 
Ukrainian citizens.
The Kiev routes will be to Barcelona, Bratislava, Gdansk, Krakow, London, Poznan, Stockholm, Vilnius, Warsaw 
and Wroclaw. The Lviv routes will be to Duesseldorf, Krakow, London, Memmingen and Warsaw. (Reuters)

Highlight: No one quite knows how Strawberry Hill House – once owned by members of Def Leppard – got its 
name, but its expansive dimensions and stunning views over Dublin Bay are likely to entice the well-heeled buyer 
Body
On exiting the grounds of Strawberry Hill House onto Vico Road in south Co Dublin, particularly on a sunny spring 
morning, one could be forgiven for taking a moment to consider what side of the road to drive one’s car on. Such is 
the Mediterranean coastal feel of the sprawling Italian-style villa, which is perched on the waterfront side of Killiney 
Hill overlooking Dublin Bay.
Built in the 1840s, the 702 square metre superhome is on the market with joint agents Sherry FitzGerald and Knight 
Frank, and is guiding €5.95 million, a little over half a million euro less than first sought when it came to the market 
some 18 or so months ago.
Passers-by may be familiar with the white-washed single-storey villa-style roadside facade, which is topped by a 
row of balusters or decorative columns. Yet it is the expansive rear of the house, which clings to the steep slope of 
the hill and opens to stepped, levelled gardens and an astroturf tennis court, that really wow the visitor.
The principal rooms of the house overlook the bay with perhaps the more functional rooms on the north-eastern 
side, including the utility room, dressing rooms, bathrooms, en suites, a teenagers’ den and storage rooms. There’s 
also an enviable study and a formal dining room that face the road, but the remaining reception rooms, the 
bedrooms, the separate gym and the kitchen all enjoy unobstructed sea views and access to private terraces.
How it was named remains a mystery – and there is an (admittedly small) resemblance to the white-washed Gothic 
castle of the same name along the banks of the River Thames at Twickenham, but Vico Road’s Strawberry Hill 
House can lay claim to a rock ’n’ roll ownership history.
In 1983, the residence was divided into three and, in that format, was later bought by Joe Elliott and Rick Savage of 
Def Leppard. Savage then recombined the two largest units to create Strawberry Hill House and refurbished the 
residence to create a worthy trophy home featuring a recording studio, bar and gym.
An appealing vista on Killiney Hill
[caption id="attachment_412413" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] The sun room and terrace overlook Dublin 
Bay[/caption]
In 2003, it was purchased by Ryanair co-founder Declan Ryan, and about two years later was sold on to its current 
owner, David Murphy. The architect and founder of Model Works and his family moved about a kilometre up the 
road to Strawberry Hill House from their home on the corner of Sorrento Close and Sorrento Road.
An apartment – from the days when the house was divided in three – remains underneath the southern terrace off 
the living room, and is entirely separate and not part of the sale. However, the owner of it shares forecourt parking 
with the owners of Strawberry Hill House.
Once through the roll-back automatic gates and onto the driveway that the current owners installed, the main 
entrance is through a comparatively modest Victorian porch with a tiled floor and roof light, which opens to an 
expansive entrance hall with teasing glimpses of the sea beyond.
The hall floors are laid in French limestone, and boast original decorative ceiling plasterwork. A curved staircase 
with a wrought-iron balustrade on the left hand side of the hall drops away to the middle floor accommodation 
below. The presence of a high bell tower over the stairwell gives way to impressive triple-height views across the 
bay.
Immediately to the left of the entrance is a handsome study with an original stained glass bay window, solid timber 
floors, a cast iron fireplace, period plasterwork and a bespoke, oak fitted bookcase.
The dining room, across the hall, overlooks a front courtyard through two large, stained glass windows. The room 
has pine floors and period plasterwork.
Wide, glazed double doors at the rear of the entrance hall open to an expansive dual aspect family room with 
limestone floors, a large marble fireplace with a gas fire insert and French doors that open to a balcony overlooking 
the gardens and the sea.
The kitchen, off the family room, features Alno fitted base and wall-mounted units with deeper than average 
worktops, a full complement of designer label integrated appliances and timber floors.
The drawing room at the southern end of the house has stunning sea views through large picture windows with 
fitted blinds.
The dual aspect room has the palest apple-green carpet, mirrored alcoves and two sets of timber-framed French 
doors that open to a large, private terrace with panoramic sea views.
[caption id="attachment_412409" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] A view of the garden and tennis court[/caption]
The master suite on the level below enjoys the same views. It boasts an enviable, fully-fitted walk-in 
wardrobe/dressing room and a modern en suite with a freestanding bath, double wash hand basins and vanity 
units, a separate corner power shower and tiled floors with underfloor heating.
This level also boasts a dual aspect games/snooker room with timber floors, a gallery room, a guest bathroom with 
a large corner shower, a cosy den or entertainment room, a side porch opening to a long, terracotta tiled, sunny and 
private terrace and an equally long sunroom with teak floors, three sets of French doors and a long, walk-in storage 
room at the rear of it.
This well-considered space, Sherry FitzGerald agent Rosie Mulvany points out, is the equivalent of attic storage in a 
traditional home.
Another five bedrooms are situated on the lower floor, two of which are en suite. There’s also a guest WC with the 
original antique WC and cistern, another open-plan den with a bay window overlooking the sea, and a large tiled 
An appealing vista on Killiney Hill
utility room with additional fitted storage, a Belfast sink, plumbing for a washing machine and dryer and a Sheila’s 
maid (or ceiling mounted clothes airer).
There is also a stone cellar at this level, as well as additional storage rooms, a separate, plumbed gym overlooking 
the tiered grounds and the sea, and a double, air conditioned garage with a sliding door and camera monitor onto 
Vico Road.
As well as the terraces, front courtyard and the tennis court, the well-tended and mature grounds at Strawberry Hill 
House feature gravel walkways, tiered, manicured lawns bound by lavender and box hedging, mature shrubs and 
flowering plants and specimen trees including a fig and pear tree.
There are also strawberry beds and trailing vines and a unexpected, almost secret garden area with a fish pond and 
water feature and plenty of seating dotted all around the property from which to enjoy the tranquil, maritime views.
I viewed the house on a sunny spring morning and could have imagined myself anywhere along Italy’s Amalfi 
shores, thus reinforcing this stretch of the coastline’s Irish Riviera nickname.
That said, even on the stormiest, most miserable day, the views from Strawberry Hill House would undoubtedly be 
breathtaking.
To arrange a viewing, contact either Rosie Mulvany at Sherry FitzGerald’s Dalkey branch at 01-2751000, or Rena 
O’Kelly at Knight Frank’s city centre office at 01-6342466.

Laudamotion's experience with "super aircraft" built by Airbus has been cited by Ryanair as an attractive benefit 
from its proposed purchase of a 75% stake in the Austrian carrier.
Ryanair has long touted the advantages of flying a single-type Boeing 737 fleet, but the Irish carrier's chief 
operating officer Peter Bellew told FlightGlobal in Brussels yesterday that "Airbus makes super aircraft, so there's 
no reason why we wouldn't have Airbus aircraft in future in Ryanair".
The move by Ryanair to take a majority stake in Laudamotion came just weeks after the Vienna-based carrier had 
completed a purchase of assets from defunct Airbus operator Niki – including its technical department.
Bellew cites Laudamotion's EASA Part-145 maintenance approval for Airbus types, and its "hangarage down there 
to be able to do Airbus operation of Airbus-trained pilots", as attractive to Ryanair.
"They've been doing it a long time. They've been very professional and proficient at it," he adds.
Bellew says an Airbus operation is something Ryanair has "been interested in for a number of years", echoing the 
statement from chief executive Michael O'Leary when the proposed Laudamotion stake was first announced.
"So for us, [the Laudamotion deal] would be diversifying our aircraft sourcing. They have experience in that," says 
Bellew.
While he stopped short of confirming any Ryanair plan to take Airbus aircraft, Bellew expects to see "Airbus aircraft 
increasing in Laudamotion".

aircraft" made by Airbus has been cited by Ryanair as an....
He meanwhile confirms that the six aircraft Ryanair will lease to Laudamotion as part of the initial deal will be 737-
800s.
Ryanair announced on 20 March that it had agreed to acquire 75% of Laudamotion for 50 million ($62 million).
The budget carrier says it will initially buy 24.9% of the Austrian carrier and plans to increase the stake to 75% 
subject to EU competition approval.
Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that Ryanair has 427 Boeing 737s in service and 145 on order – including 110 737 
Max 8s.

AP Moller-Maersk unexpectedly replaced its finance director, unnerving investors yesterday in the middle of the 
biggest transformation in the Danish conglomerate's history.
Maersk's shares fell as much as 5 per cent as investors fretted about how the departure of Jakob Stausholm would 
affect the break-up of the conglomerate. Maersk has sold its oil and tankers businesses to France's Total and its 
main family shareholder, respectively. It is also aiming to divest rigs and supply services operations this year. 
Shares later recovered to close down 2 per cent at DKr9,302 - their lowest in 18 months.
Prosecutors raided BMW's Munich headquarters yesterday and said they had launched a preliminary investigation 
into suspected diesel emissions fraud at the luxury carmaker, a day before BMW's 2017 earnings report. 
Nonetheless, BMW shares still rose 1 per cent on the day.
Airbus rallied 2.5 per cent, topping the blue-chip pan-European Euro Stoxx 50, after news that Ryanair had bought 
a majority stake in the Austrian Laudamotion airline. The stake will finally allow Ryanair to develop a fleet of Airbus 
aircraft, which the company expects will number 80 of its planes. Richard Milne, Patrick McGee and Cat Rutter

Norwegian Air Shuttle is raising fresh capital, selling off some aircraft and putting its frequent flyer scheme up for 
sale as the fast-growing low-cost airline tries to shore up its finances.
Norwegian also announced deepening estimated losses for the first quarter despite rapidly increasing revenues.
The low-cost carrier, which has targeted the long-haul market with flights from Europe to the US, Asia and 
Argentina, will raise NKr1.3bn through a private placement, it announced yesterday.
It will sell five Airbus 320neo aircraft that will lead to an estimated gain of $15m-$20m, while it has started a 
strategic review of its Reward programme that will look at "its incorporation and possibly ownership". A subsidiary 
has also signed a sale and leaseback deal for six aircraft that will boost its liquidity by $250m.
Norwegian is coming to the end of a dizzying period of growth during which it has challenged low-cost rivals such 
as Ryanair and forced flag carriers to launch their own budget offerings.
But investors are increasingly worried about growing losses and its stretched balance sheet, with its shares 
languishing at a five-year low.
Norwegian said its pre-tax loss for the first quarter was expected to be NKr2.6bn compared with a NKr1.8bn loss a 
year earlier. Revenues increased by almost a third to NKr7.1bn.
Norwegian seeks capital with losses set to widen; Airlines
The airline said: "Additional capital will boost competitiveness and protect existing and future investments in a 
market characterised by higher oil prices and fluctuating currencies.
"The company is now positioning itself for the final stages of a strong growth period that has lasted for several years 
and will reach its peak by the second quarter of 2018."
The pace of its expansion has caused an increase in costs and Norwegian said that fuel prices and exchange rates 
were worse than it had previously estimated. Jet fuel was 12 per cent higher in the first quarter and the euro 8 per 
cent stronger than anticipated.
Norwegian currently has 150 aircraft and expects to have 193 by the end of next year.

Ryanair has agreed to buy a majority stake in the airline founded by Niki Lauda - two months after the former 
Formula One champion scuppered an attempt by British Airways' owner IAG to snap it up.
The Irish carrier will acquire 75 per cent of Austria's LaudaMotion subject to EU competition approval, it said 
yesterday. It will take a 24.9 per cent stake until the all-clear is received.
British Airways' parent IAG had been the successful bidder for the airline when it was sold under the insolvency of 
previous owner Air Berlin. The sale was overturned in January, however, when insolvency proceedings were moved 
from Germany to Austria, prompting a fresh round of bids that Mr Lauda won. Yesterday, he said that he had 
"always stood up for competition and ... opposed monopolies". The deal meant his airline would "be able to 
establish itself as a strong competitor".
Ryanair said the cost of the 75 per cent investment would be less than (EURO)50m, although it would provide an 
additional (EURO)50m for start-up and operating costs in the first year.
Mr Lauda will chair the board and "oversee the implementation of his strategy to build a successful Austrian low-
fares airline".

RYANAIR said yesterday it will take a majority stake in Niki Lauda's Austrian airline Laudamotion which will be 
based in Vienna.
In January, it was confirmed the former Formula One champion had trumped British Airways owner IAG to secure 
the insolvent leisure airline Niki, which he had previously founded.
Now in a fresh blow to the airline giant, today it was confirmed that Ryanair had agreed to support Lauda in his 
efforts to develop Laudamotion, acquiring an initial 24.9 per cent stake in the carrier. This will rise to 75 per cent 
subject if it gets EU Competition approval.
Ryanair said the cost will be under (EURO)50m, but it will plug an additional (EURO)50m into the first year for the 
airline's start up and operating costs.
Lauda will chair the board of the airline, with Ryanair providing financial and management support.

Ryanair plans to buy a stake in new Austrian leisure carrier Laudamotion, helping former motor racing champion 
Niki Lauda to get the airline up and running and giving the Irish carrier a bigger presence in Germany and Austria.
Ryanair has agreed to buy an initial 24.9% stake in Laudamotion, formed out of insolvent carrier Niki which was part 
of Air Berlin, and plans for that to rise to 75% "as soon as possible," subject to EU approval.
The Irish budget carrier will invest less than 50 million euros, though will provide an additional 50 million euros in 
funding for start-up and operating costs in the first year.
"This Laudamotion partnership is good news for Austrian and German consumers/visitors who can now look 
forward to real competition, more choice and lower fares," Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
Niki, which flies to tourist destinations from Germany and Austria using A320 planes, was seen as the most 
attractive part of insolvent Air Berlin.
Germany's largest carrier Lufthansa dropped plans to buy Niki in December over competition concerns.
British Airways parent IAG then won a bidding round, before that decision was canceled over legal action. Lauda 
eventually won a new bidding process to buy back the airline he founded. (Reuters)

Canadian startup Jetlines has shelved plans to begin flights in June due to regulatory delays and aircraft acquisition 
struggles, a development that leaves WestJet's Swoop in position to become the country's first ultra-low-cost carrier 
(ULCC).
"The key items remaining to commence flight operations are the completion of the licensing process, aircraft 
acquisition and completion of the financing process," says Jetlines in a media release.
"At this stage Jetlines is in advanced negotiations with several major aircraft lessors to secure the aircraft required 
to support both its start-up and growth plans," the company adds. "However, it will not attain a June 2018 start-up 
date as previously projected."
The company may provide a new launch timeline during the second quarter, it says.
"In the interim, Jetlines continues to advance its efforts with personnel recruitment, airport agreements, the 
licensing process and the financing plan," according to the company.
Jetlines has for months promoted a plan to launch flights in June from Hamilton and Kitchener-Waterloo, both of 
which are in Ontario about 80km (50 miles) from Toronto. It also planned flights from Halifax.
The company aimed to become Canada's first ULCC with a business plan resembling that of established 
discounters Spirit Airlines and Ryanair.
The company last year announced it signed agreements with an unnamed US lessor to lease two Boeing 737-800s.
But, it now says those aircraft are unavailable.
Jetlines cancels June launch E Canadian startup Jetlines has shelved plans to begin flights in June due to 
regulatory delays and aircraft acquisition struggles,....
”Jetlines previously secured aircraft under an [letter of intent]. However, the lessor was unable to provide a 
definitive delivery date," the company's release says.
The company also has orders for five 737 Max 7s, with deliveries scheduled for 2023 and 2024.
Jetlines attributes its fleet acquisition struggles to broader developments in the commercial aircraft market, including 
problems with Pratt & Whitney PW1100G engines that power Airbus A320neos. Various issues with those engines 
have delayed Airbus's A320neo deliveries to airlines.
Jetlines also cites increased demand from cargo airlines for 737-800s and, more generally, strong worldwide air 
travel demand.
"All of these factors have led to increased demand and decreased supply of used aircraft available for lease," 
Jetlines says.
With Jetlines out of the game for the near future, WestJet stands to enter the ULCC market unopposed with its 
Swoop unit.
WestJet created Swoop to capture demand from the ultra-discount market segment. The unit will operate 189-seat 
737-800s.
Though Swoop ignited a dispute between WestJet and its pilots, the company has insisted Swoop will begin flights 
on 25 June.
Jetlines has been seeking to get off the ground for several years. It received a boost in late 2016 when the 
Canadian government granted it an exemption from a 25% cap on foreign ownership, setting the cap instead at 
49%.
Soon after Jetlines raised start up cash through a public offering of stock and announced its intention to start flights 
in summer 2017.
That never happened.
Still, Jetlines appeared to be progressing toward launch. The company in 2017 hired former Sun Country Airlines 
chief executive Stan Gadek as its CEO, succeeding former head Jim Scott.

Europe's biggest budget airline, Ryanair, on Tuesday announced an agreement to take over a majority of nascent 
carrier Laudamotion - a deal that challenges rival Lufthansa on the German market.
Dublin-based Ryanair said it planned to take over 75 per cent of Laudamotion, only weeks after Austrian 
businessman Niki Lauda bought the carrier back from insolvent German budget airline Air Berlin.
One of Laudamotion's main hubs is Dusseldorf in western Germany, which is also the seat of Lufthansa's budget 
subsidiary Eurowings.
"I stand for competition, and everyone knows my critical stance towards monopolies," former Formula One 
champion Lauda told a press conference in Dusseldorf, referring to Lufthansa's market dominance in German-
speaking countries.
Ryanair said it would buy 24.9 per of Vienna-based Laudamotion at first, and would expand its stake as soon as 
possible, pending approval from the EU market watchdog.
Ryanair said it will pay a sum below 50 million euros (61.5 million dollars) for the 75 per cent, in addition to 50 
million dollars to fund Laudamotion's start-up and operating costs during its first year in business.
In addition, Ryanair will lease six of its aircraft and crews to Laudamotion, which will increase its fleet to 21 aircraft.
While Laudamotion is currently focused on flying holidaymakers from Germany, Austria and Switzerland to 
Mediterranean destinations, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said that he wants Laudamotion to offer 
regular scheduled flights to other destinations in the future.
Ryanair challenges Lufthansa with Laudamotion takeover plan
Ryanair's aircraft and funding would allow Laudamotion "to compete in a market which is dominated by Lufthansa's 
high airfares with its Swiss and Austrian subsidiaries," he said.
Lauda founded Niki in 2003. After selling it to the Air Berlin group in 2011, he bought it back in January and 
renamed it Laudamotion.
Lufthansa had also tried to buy Niki, but abandoned its bid after the European Commission signalled that it would 
block the deal because of competition worries.

75% subject to EU competition approval.

Vienna-based Laudamotion will begin services from Austria, Germany and Switzerland to leisure destinations in 
Italy, Greece and Spain this summer, using assets acquired from the administrators of Niki earlier this year.
Ryanair estimates that Laudamotion can reach profitability by its third year of operations and grow its fleet to at 
least 30 Airbus aircraft "if successful".
"We look forward to working in partnership with Niki Lauda to successfully develop his vision for a successful 
Austrian low-fares airline to service the schedule and charter markets," states Ryanair chief executive Michael 
O'Leary.
"The Laudamotion air operator's certificate will support a fleet of Airbus aircraft, which is something we have hoped 
to develop within the Ryanair group for some years."
Niki Lauda states: "I have always stood up for competition and have opposed monopolies. Therefore I am thrilled 
that in the partnership with Ryanair, Laudamotion will be able to establish itself as a strong competitor and to grow 
quickly and sustainably.

BERLIN (AP) - Budget airline Ryanair says it is taking an initial 24.9 percent stake in an Austrian-based airline 
being set up by former Formula 1 driver Niki Lauda.
It plans to raise its holding to 75 percent.
LaudaMotion is the successor to Niki, long a subsidiary of bankrupt Air Berlin, which Lauda bought back after it fell 
victim to its parent's financial woes. It plans to operate scheduled and charter flights from Germany, Austria and 
Switzerland to largely Mediterranean destinations.
Ryanair said Tuesday that it plans to increase its stake to 75 percent "as soon as possible," subject to European 
Union approval.
It said that the total stake will cost it less than 50 million euros ($61.5 million), but it will invest another 50 million 
euros in startup and initial operating costs.

Europe's biggest budget airline, Ryanair, said Tuesday that it has agreed to take over 75 per cent of Laudamotion, 
the new air carrier owned by Austrian businessman Niki Lauda.
Dublin-based Ryanair said it would buy 24.9 per cent at first and would expand its stake as soon as possible, 
pending approval from the EU market watchdog.
Laudamotion is the successor of Niki, a former subsidiary of insolvent German budget carrier Air Berlin.
Ryanair said it will pay a sum below 50 million euros (61.5 million dollars) for the 75 per cent, in addition to 50 
million dollars to fund Laudamotion's start-up and operating costs during its first year in business.
In addition, Ryanair will lease six of its aircraft and crews to Laudamotion, which will increase its fleet to 21 aircraft.
Former Formula One champion Lauda founded Niki in 2003. After selling it to the Air Berlin group in 2011, he 
bought it back in January and renamed it Laudamotion.

UNIONS representing Ryanair pilots across Europe have signed a deal to cooperate in a move that could raise the 
prospect of coordinated action, something its management has been keen to avoid.
In the agreement signed on Saturday, the unions decided to form a transnational pilot group to negotiate with 
Ryanair at a pan-European level, the European Cockpit Association said. Ryanair is in talks to formalise union 
recognition in several European countries but it has refused requests to engage with pilots on a pan-European 
basis. It did not respond to a request for comment.

Sir, Thank you for Charlie Porter's article "Are you fur real?" (Life & Arts, March 10). During the "rather naked than 
fur" episode in the 1990s I bought a second-hand mink coat at the Drouot auctions in Paris for a knockdown price. It 
still serves me well, which is the intention of a good coat in cold winters.
In my student years travelling to Tuscany, I watched how farmers put leftover wool from their sheep around their 
olive trees to fertilise them. My mink coat could do that too. Can you do this with Goretex and plastic sneakers? 
Sabine Liebherr Vevey, Switzerland Sir, Further to Charlie Porter's interesting and thoughtful article on fur (March 
10): we bought a marvellous fur coat for my wife many years ago at a bargain price as a result of the anti-fur 
campaign. On a trip to Milan one February she refused to take it on the grounds that we were flying Ryanair. Taking 
the metro in Milan, she was the only woman in the carriage not wearing a fur coat!

Ryanair will offer direct employment contracts within the next few weeks to all pilots in Germany who are currently 
on contracts via an agency, the budget airline said on Thursday.
The Irish carrier has come under fire from unions, especially in Germany, for its practice of employing some pilots 
via third-party agencies, such as McGinley Aviation. The airline last year decided to recognise unions in an attempt 
to improve relations with its pilots and ease a staffing crunch.
"McGinley Aviation have decided to withdraw from supplying contractor pilots for Ryanair in the German market, 
and Ryanair has now begun the process of offering these contractors direct employment," a Ryanair spokeswoman 
said.
McGinley said that after a review of operations, it would cease to provide contractors in Germany from Oct. 31.
"We continue to supply contractor pilots to all other countries in Ryanair's growing European network and look 
forward to a future continued relationship with our customer," a spokeswoman said via email.
Ryanair has so far agreed union recognition deals in Britain and Italy and hopes for similar in Spain by the end of 
the month.
Goodbody analysts said the move to offer direct contracts in Germany should help to ease relations between 
Ryanair management and the German pilots union.
A spokesman for German union Vereinigung Cockpit said it would first have to see the terms of the new direct 
contracts before commenting. (Reuters)

THE GLOBAL low-cost airlines market is projected to reach $208bn (£149bn) in 2023 thanks to the growth of the 
growth of the travel and tourism sectors.
A report by Allied Market Research said the market was valued at $117bn in 2016 but will grow substantially by 
2023 due to factors such as increased economic activity, ease of travel, travel and tourism industry, urbanisation, 
and a continuing consumer preference for low cost services.
The report also attributed the success of low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Easyjet to an increase in purchasing 
power of middle-class households and increased e-literacy.
In 2016, there were an estimated 3.8bn global scheduled airline passengers, with 28 per cent of these passengers 
choosing to travel by low cost airlines.

Ryanair consolidated its position as Italy's largest airline by growing passenger numbers there more than 10% in 
2017, new figures from civil aviation authority ENAC show.
The Irish budget carrier transported 36.3 million people in Italy last year, a rise of 11.2%. Alitalia's passenger 
numbers shrank 5.8% to 21.8 million.
EasyJet grew its figure 11% to 16.5 million and remains Italy's third-largest carrier. Vueling's numbers narrowed 
very slightly, by 0.5%, to 5.87 million, but it is still the country's fourth-largest airline, followed by Lufthansa with 4.5 
million.
The ENAC statistics show that Eurowings was the fastest-growing airline in the country last year, with passenger 
numbers rising 330%, from 354,000 to 1.53 million.
Ryanair is also Italy's largest airline in terms of international passengers, having carried more than 25 million in 
2017. EasyJet meanwhile carried 13.7 million and Alitalia 9.61 million.
The Italian flag carrier remains the largest airline in the domestic market, carrying 12.2 million passengers during 
the year, while Ryanair carried 11.1 million and EasyJet 2.83 million.
Ryanair operates the "top" domestic route in Italy, between Rome Fiumicino and Catania, and the main 
international route, which is Rome Ciampino to Stansted, says ENAC, without disclosing figures for the routes.
Italy's largest EU route by passenger numbers was between Rome Fiumicino and Barcelona, with a figure of 1.22 
million. Next is the route from the Italian capital to Amsterdam, with 1.11 million, and Madrid, with 1.09 million.
Ryanair extends lead as Italy 's biggest carrier Ryanair consolidated its position as Italy 's largest airline by 
growing passenger numbers there more than 10% ....
Six of the top 10 routes to EU states from Italy are operated from Rome Fiumicino. Milan Malpensa and Venice are 
also on the list.
The largest non-EU route by passenger numbers is Rome Fiumicino to New York JFK with 688,000, followed by 
Milan Malpensa to New York with 686,000 and Milan Malpensa to Dubai with 660,000.
Rome-Tel Aviv is the next largest non-EU route with 637,000 passengers; Rome-Dubai follows with 622,000.
Fiumicino remains Italy's busiest airport despite declining 1.8% to 40.8 million. Milan Malpensa grew its total 14% to 
22 million. Bergamo grew 6% to 12.2 million.
Total passenger numbers travelling to or within Italy grew 6.2% to 175 million. More than half of that number were 
carried by low-cost carriers.

How far will US packaging firm go to box off Smurfit Kappa ?
How far will US packaging firm go to box off Smurfit Kappa?
Sunday Business Post
March 10, 2018

Length: 1044 words
Byline: Ian Guider
Highlight: There is a rationale behind the move by International Paper, and though it has been rebuffed, there is 
speculation that a deal could be reached if the price was right, writes Ian Guider 
Body
Before there was CRH, Kerry Group or Ryanair, there was one business that could truly claim to be Ireland’s only 
multinational company. While turning paper into boxes may not have been the sexiest of industries, over the years 
Michael Smurfit transformed the factory he inherited from his father Jefferson into a world leader at a time when 
there were few Irish international success stories.
For decades, Jefferson Smurfit provided Michael Smurfit and his shareholders with enormous wealth. Michael may 
have cashed out when the company was eventually acquired by US private equity giant Madison Dearborn in 2002, 
but still the company bore the family name and his son Tony has since become chief executive.
Is all of that history about to end? Last week, Smurfit Kappa, as the company is now called following its merger over 
a decade ago with Dutch firm Kappa, said that it had been the subject of a takeover approach by the American 
packaging giant International Paper (IP). If the deal is sealed, it will be the largest-ever takeover of an Irish 
company.
Getting to that point, though, will probably cost International Paper a lot more money than it may want to pay. The 
formal approach by International Paper may have happened on St Valentine’s Day, but Smurfit Kappa has been on 
the mind of the Memphis-based company for some time. In April 2015, shares in Smurfit soared on speculation that 
a deal between the two companies might be in the offing.
As analysts at Citigroup wrote at the time, a takeover of Smurfit by IP would be highly complementary. It would 
have faced little regulatory opposition and had the potential to generate huge cost savings. While Smurfit is the 
biggest supplier of boxes in Europe and Latin America, International Paper is the leader in North America.
That bout of takeover speculation followed a $16 billion merger between MWV and RockTenn and ultimately went 
nowhere. (Coincidentally, Citigroup is now acting as one of the financial advisers to Smurfit Kappa.)
How far will US packaging firm go to box off Smurfit Kappa ?
That is, until International Paper made its approach on February 14, a week after Smurfit’s annual results. The two 
sides agreed to a meeting on February 23 at which International Paper executives laid out their proposal and 
presented a letter for Smurfit’s board to consider. The deal would be a mix of cash and shares.
[caption id="attachment_411541" align="alignleft" width="363"] Jefferson Smurfit[/caption]
Smurfit investors would get €22 in cash and 0.3 shares in the new entity. Based on exchange rates at the time it 
would be worth €36.46 a share to Smurfit - a chunky 30 per cent premium to the Irish company’s shares the day 
before International Paper made first contact.
Last Tuesday, Smurfit went public with the news of the approach and called the proposal that had been tabled 
highly opportunistic. Its business was motoring along, with record sales of €8.5 billion last year, and it had solid 
prospects for the next few years.
Its shares soared and continued to gain for most of last week. Although the two public statements from Smurfit have 
clearly rebuffed the American company, word has got around that a deal could still be reached, but at a price well 
above the current proposal, which valued Smurfit at €8.6 billion.
Just how far is International Paper, which is much larger than Smurfit, willing to go to get its hands on the prize? A 
figure of €40 a share has been mooted to get talks under way.
According to Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Will Heffernan the cash portion of the deal will also have to rise to tempt 
shareholders.
“IP’s first offer had approximately 60 per cent in cash. If you apply the same logic to the €40 level, it works out at 
€24 in cash. We do not think this would be sufficient for Smurfit shareholders and expect that IP would have to 
increase the cash element of its proposal.”
A €40 a share offer, though, could still be too low, “considering Smurfit’s growth prospects, solid balance sheet and 
peer and sector multiples”. If it went to €43 a share, with 70 per cent of it cash, Heffernan wrote in a research note, 
“some major Smurfit shareholders would be more comfortable with that. It should be noted some of the top 
shareholders in Smurfit include a US hedge fund and several sovereign wealth funds, whom in our opinion would 
prefer as large a cash component as possible”.
Many analysts think that a price above €40 a share gets a deal done, although Wells Fargo analyst Chris Manuel 
thinks that the current proposal of €36.46 represents an already full offer for shares.
While price might be the biggest gap between Smurfit and International Paper, there is little doubt that the rationale 
still exists. The credit ratings agency Moody’s said that while the deal would boost International Paper’s debt levels, 
it sees “long-term benefits to the potential acquisition, including enhanced geographic diversification and 
operational efficiencies”.
The paper and packaging sector is consolidating quickly. Financial news agency Bloomberg calculated last week 
that 44 deals, including the potential Smurfit one, have been announced in 2018 alone. The wave of deals is 
allowing companies to cut costs and also to capitalise on the boom in online shopping, which is creating extra 
demand for packaging, and to cater for discount retailers who want shelf-ready packaging. All of this is allowing the 
paper companies to grow earnings.
If a deal is ultimately agreed between Smurfit and International Paper, it will mark the end of one of Ireland’s 
corporate legends. Barring the five years when Smurfit was owned by Madison Dearborn, it has been an 
independent company.
The vast majority of its 46,000 staff may well have been located overseas, but this was very much an Irish 
company. There are not too many Irish companies with a market cap north of €8 billion.
How far will US packaging firm go to box off Smurfit Kappa ?
Will International Paper want to keep the Smurfit name over the door? That brand name may hold little sway in 
Tennessee, but it is a name synonymous with Irish business. A little piece of history may be about to end.

Highlight: Airmid Healthgroup already has traction in US and Canada 
Body
An anti-allergen company that counts global brands such as Dyson and Siemens among its clients has attracted 
backing from several wealthy business people and is ramping up expansion plans.
Dublin-based Airmid Healthgroup is backed by former aviation businessman Peter Ledbetter and wealthy Clare 
businessman Dominic Considine among other high net worth investors.
Ledbetter worked with Ryanair founder Tony Ryan to help set up Guinness Peat Aviation in the 1980s and was later 
in senior positions at Irish Permanent and Guinness & Mahon.
Considine sold his loyalty firm for €25 million, a substantial chunk of which he netted from the sale.
Founded by immunologist Dr Bruce Mitchell, Airmid has a significant market in the US, Canada and Asia. It is 
launching two new products this year, one globally and one in Ireland.
It was set up almost ten years ago to run tests for companies that made products such as vacuum cleaners, 
bedding and cleaning products, and provide anti-allergen certification for the effectiveness of the claims made for 
their products.
Launched in North America, it was highly successful there, and Airmid went on to develop tests for bacteria, moulds 
and viruses, and added companies in China to its international client list.
Its new global product is a test for bed bugs, which are a huge financial threat for businesses such as the hotel 
industry.
“If you go to a place with a lot of hotels like New York it’s a huge commercial and litigous issue,” said Mitchell. “So 
now we have a rapid test for bed bugs that we would hope to launch in the next six months.

“You’d be amazed at the impact that these kinds of critters can have in hotels, healthcare or dormitories.”
In Ireland Airmid is launching a programme called Health Friendly Air, which it will pitch to big corporates such as 
Google and Facebook and to the healthcare sector, testing for moulds, bacteria or viruses and overall air quality 
and issuing a Health Friendly Air logo where standards are met.
“It would be an Irish thing initially, with Ireland as a starting market,” said Mitchell. “We would plan to roll it out to 
North America.”
Airmid has been profitable for the last five years to the tune of around €250,000 a year, earnings of around €1.5 
million annually, and plans to build substantially on that in coming years.
It is backed by around €600,000, including from wealth funds where Ledbetter and Considine have invested.

Upping the Ante: Canny punters see beyond the Cheltenham hysteria

Highlight: The bigger festival may get all the hype, but the Midlands National offers attractive prospects 
Body
Cheltenham’s racing festival, taking place this week, is the fourth-largest sporting event in Britain, with a quarter of 
a million people attending.
That figure is swelled greatly by Irish racegoers, who spend more than €22 million at the four-day meet, with 
Ryanair and Aer Lingus boasting excellent business either side of that spend.
A study of Cheltenham’s economic impact carried out by Gloucestershire University showed that Irish people 
bought 57,375 tickets for the 2016 renewal. In this country, it is clear that no racing festival matters more than the 
one that takes place in England’s west country.
Last year, Irish-trained horses accounted for 19 of the 28 winners, a scarcely believable result, considering that in 
2012 there were just five triumphant horses there coming from this island. With Paul Nicholls, once the main British 
trainer, now operating at a much-less relevant level, the expectation is that either Gordon Elliott from Co Meath or 
Co Kilkenny native Willie Mullins will win the trainers’ title at the festival.
It is frequently said that racing’s hegemony is cyclical – yet British racing is suffering because prize-money at the 
lower level remains derisory. This has rendered the notion of owning a horse trained in Britain particularly illogical, 
even in the context of owning a racehorse having never been a pragmatic idea.
Results matter to Horse Racing Ireland, which has been critical to racing getting colossal funding every year, to the 
extent that half of the prize-money over here has been a government donation. British racing has had no such 
comfort.
Results matter to the bookmakers too; they often reference Cheltenham to explain good or bad quarterly results. 
“Cheltenham has a really large bearing on the year,” said a Paddy Power trader. “There is a proper buzz in the 
trading room, though it can get a little tense if results are going awry.”
Upping the Ante: Canny punters see beyond the Cheltenham hysteria
I was sucked into backing horses by going to the pub to watch this meeting for the first time many years ago. There 
is no doubt that backing a winner at the festival can hook you forever, whether you want that or not.
This column has put forward a handful of select wagers at prices ranging from 7/1 to 25/1. Our hopes next week 
rest on Saldier in the Triumph Hurdle, Mall Dini in the Kim Muir, Felix Desjy in the Champion Bumper and Melon (in 
the race to finish second to Buveur D’Air) in the Champion Hurdle.
There are 28 races, and almost limitless betting possibilities. The key for those punting is less in picking the right 
horses and more in dealing with losses. Even the most experienced can lose the head if results are going against 
them – and this is on the Tuesday, with less than a quarter of the festival over.
Even if you have an unprofitable Cheltenham, it is but a dot on the punting map. Indeed, the following day – 
Saturday upcoming – offers another opportunity, perhaps one greater than any available at Cheltenham, the value 
mainly gone after months of ante-post speculation.
Uttoxeter’s Midlands National in six days’ time has a purse (of £125,000) that would not be out of place at the 
Cheltenham Festival. It is a slog of a handicap steeplechase more appealing to certain horses than anything run 
earlier in the week and it tends to be less competitive.
You will hear so much about Cheltenham fever that the Midlands National tends to be ignored amidst the hysteria. 
Yet there is a 20/1 shot available who surely should be less than half those odds.
Back to the Thatch fell when cantering in the Eider last month when sent off 6/1 and Saturday’s race may not be 
much better.
“It was so frustrating,” wrote rider Richard Johnson in his blog. “I felt pretty confident he’d stay the trip and we know 
he goes in the soft ground.”
Given that his options are running out as the summer nears, it was no surprise Johnson mentioned Saturday’s race 
as his next possible engagement. The horse is open to lots of improvement too.

RYANAIR signed a deal yesterday recognising Italian pilots union Anpac, its second such agreement in a major 
market amid talks across Europe aimed at averting strike action.
The Irish budget airline halted widespread strikes before Christmas with a shock last-minute decision to recognise 
unions for the first time in its 32-year history. That came after it had to cancel 20,000 flights earlier last year due to a 
shortage of standby pilots.
Pilots in the airline's two largest markets - the UK and Italy - have reached agreement with management. Ryanair 
said this week that it expects to finalise a deal with pilots in its third biggest market in Spain within the next month.
The Italian union said in a statement that the agreement was "historical for Italian pilots", who had engaged for 
years in seeking union recognition together with clear job and salary conditions that are in line with other countries.
Ryanair operates from 86 airports across 34 countries in Europe and North Africa. Reuters

Tolerance for discomfort can save money on trip to Europe

Body
DALLAS (AP) - Europe never seems to lose its appeal to American travelers, and the growth of discount airlines 
and alternatives to expensive hotels make visiting the Old World a bit more affordable.
Whether a first-time visitor or making your first trip in many years, travel experts say there are ways you can get to 
Europe for less and make your money go further once you're there.
FLIGHTS
Airfares to Europe this summer are expected to be slightly higher than last year - blame the rise in jet fuel prices - 
but that's an overall, average figure. On some routes, fares are running well below last year's prices.
Average 2018 prices are down 30 percent or more on a handful of popular routes, including New York's JFK Airport 
to Amsterdam; Newark, New Jersey, to Paris; and Chicago to Gatwick Airport outside London, according to travel-
search site Hipmunk.
Discount international airlines including Norwegian Air, WOW Air and tiny Primera Air are or will soon be flying on 
those and many other transatlantic routes. The bigger U.S. and European airlines with more familiar names have 
been forced to match or at least reduce their own fares.
Hipmunk CEO Adam Goldstein suggests looking at routes that didn't even exist a couple years ago because the 
European budget airlines "are often flying between secondary airports on both ends, like Oakland (California) to 
Gatwick."
George Hobica, a travel expert who founded airfarewatchdog.com, said that on the low-cost airlines you might have 
to pay extra for carry-on or checked bags, "but even with bag fees they're way less than in years past."
The bargain carriers get mixed reviews - with a Google search it isn't hard to turn up complaints.
Tolerance for discomfort can save money on trip to Europe
"You have to be honest with yourself about what level of discomfort you're willing to be in for a 10-hour flight" on a 
budget airline, says Lisa Friend, a travel consultant with Rick Steves' Europe, "but for just getting there, they can be 
an excellent introductory price."
If your plans include moving about once you're in Europe, there are cheap flights on budget airlines such as 
Ryanair - again, know what you're getting. If visiting three or more countries, Eurail is offering its discounted 
second-class pass, long a favorite among college students, to people over 27 through March 29. Renting a car may 
be best for visiting small towns, but be prepared for sharply higher gasoline prices than in the U.S., for tolls 
including for driving into congested zones.
Sarah Schlichter, a senior editor at SmarterTravel, also recommends limiting a short trip to one or two destinations. 
Many visitors "try to fit too many places in one trip and they end up spending a lot of money on plane flights or train 
tickets," she says.
LODGING
With many reasonable airfares out there, visitors to Europe are likely to spend a much bigger chunk of their budget 
on lodging. Hotel rates in tourist destinations (and important centers for business travel) such as London and Paris 
are very high.
It can be cheaper to rent an apartment or a house through Airbnb, VRBO and similar services, particularly if you're 
with a family or large group. Plus the kitchen means you can cook for yourself rather than eating every meal in a 
restaurant.
Friend says when she travels to Europe in the summer, especially to expensive cities like London, she often stays 
in dormitory rooms that universities rent out while students are on summer break. "It's a clean, safe, affordable 
room, usually with access to a kitchen," she says.
You could even book a stay at a monastery or farm. If you Google unusual lodging options, Schlichter advises that 
you make sure the place is on a legitimate booking site and has recent reviews (the more the better).
Credit-card offers can help with lodging. Marriott and Hilton have both run promotions with sizable bonuses after 
hitting minimum spending targets. The points cover two or three nights in a hotel, making a week in Europe more 
affordable.
SPENDING
The dollar isn't as strong as it was at this time last year, which will make everything from hotels and meals to 
tchotchkes more expensive.
Travel experts say there are other tricks for stretching your money. Restaurant prices are usually cheaper for lunch 
than dinner, so you can save by making lunch the biggest meal. Research tipping customs where you're going. The 
standard 15 percent to 20 percent in the U.S. might not apply.
Finally, make sure your credit card has no fee on international transactions. And don't exchange currency at the 
airport store fronts; you're likely to get a poor rate.

The A4E Aviation Summit in early March showed that while Europe’s biggest airlines can agree on some issues, 
there will always be significant differences bubbling beneath the surface.
And if you need a topic to divide opinion, there are few more reliable choices than Brexit.
During a panel session at the Brussels event, the chief executives of Air France-KLM, EasyJet, IAG, Lufthansa and 
Ryanair were happy to agree that a reduction in the scope of open skies – a prospect if the UK fails to agree a new 
aviation deal with the European Union – would be a bad thing.
But stark differences emerged when it came to discussions around the likelihood of the UK's departure from the EU 
disrupting air service – and even the desirability of that happening.
"I think it’s in our interests – not for a long period of time – that aircraft are grounded," says Ryanair chief executive 
Michael O’Leary.
O'Leary, a vocal Remain supporter in the lead-up to the referendum, continues: "It’s only when you get to that stage 
that you’re going to persuade the average British voter that you were lied to in the entire Brexit debate. You were 
promised that you would leave the European Union and everything will stay the same. And the reality is, you leave 
the European Union, and everything will fundamentally change."
Recently appointed EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren was quick to jokingly lend his support to the idea of 
Ryanair grounding aircraft.
ANALYSIS: Airline chiefs disagree on chances of Brexit disruption E The A4E Aviation Summit in early March 
showed that Europe’s biggest airlines can agree on so....
But Lufthansa Group chief executive Carsten Spohr agrees with O’Leary regarding the potential for disruption to 
have a positive impact: "In theory, if we could use this industry to prove to the British how wrong their decision was, 
that might even be a good thing."
FAKE NEWS?
IAG chief executive Willie Walsh takes a different view, however. He is confident that a UK-EU agreement on 
aviation will be reached, and even labelled British newspaper the Financial Times the "Fake Times" for a story 
suggesting IAG is not prepared for Brexit.
"I'm a firm believer that this will get resolved,” Walsh states. “There’s no better industry at dealing with disruption 
than ours, [and] there's not a lot that needs to be sorted out."
Walsh was supported in his optimism about a smooth road towards Brexit by Air France-KLM chief executive Jean-
Marc Janaillac. He cites the example of Air France’s experience when an open skies agreement with the USA 
lapsed.
"I don’t believe there will be a problem," Janaillac says. "For example, some years ago, the agreement between 
France and the USA stopped and was not replaced because they didn’t agree, and the flights kept going. They 
found a temporary solution."
He goes on to suggest that there are plenty of precedents for the shape of the UK’s future relationship with the EU.
"We have many examples of different status, like with Norway, like with Switzerland, like with Canada and so on, to 
find a way of settlement between the UK and Europe. So I don’t see any great problem next year."
Asked whether he was concerned about Brexit’s impact on Virgin Atlantic – in which Air France-KLM is finalising a 
31% stake – Janaillac drew laughter by saying: "As for Virgin Atlantic, we rely on negotiations of Willie [Walsh]. We 
are, for once, behind IAG."
Walsh meanwhile expresses confidence that the UK will reach a new air services agreement with the USA. British 
Airways’ home country currently relies on its EU membership for its rights to serve US routes.
"There will be an agreement between the UK and the US. That will be a comprehensive open skies agreement," he 
states. "Anybody who doesn’t believe that is living in cloud cuckoo land.
"The UK government is determined to reach an agreement with the US. The US government is determined to reach 
an agreement with the UK. And that’s what will happen."
OTHER FORCES
Spohr notes, however, that there are forces beyond economic common sense at work when it comes to Brexit.
"In politics, there are things bigger than the economies and industry," he states. "This Brexit, none of us wanted it. 
[But] there is a tough negotiation going on and they all have sharp weapons in their pockets, and aviation is a sharp 
weapon.
"The French and the Germans, who are trying to keep Europe together, surely know that aviation can be used to 
put pressure on the British."
Those "sharp weapons" might be a strict insistence on majority-EU-ownership of airlines in the event of a "hard 
Brexit", or threats to restrict rights to fly between the UK and EU countries, for example.
Lundgren takes a different view to Spoor, however, suggesting disruption would not be in anyone's interests.
ANALYSIS: Airline chiefs disagree on chances of Brexit disruption E The A4E Aviation Summit in early March 
showed that Europe’s biggest airlines can agree on so....
"It would be inconceivable for me that there would be any politicians out there that would want to see planes being 
grounded," Lundgren states. "Everybody, I’m sure, is engaging with everybody to ensure that [a comprehensive 
agreement] happens."
O’Leary was quick to disagree in typically outspoken fashion.
"I think there is going to be a real crisis," O’Leary asserts. "I believe there will be disruption in flights between the 
UK and Europe. I think partly because it is in the German and French interest to push the ownership issue to the 
maximum extent."
Walsh hit back at this, saying "I don’t think it’s an issue that’s in the interests of France". He cites the fact that KLM 
"serves more UK cities than I do" to demonstrate that most stakeholders in Europe would want to avoid a messy, 
point-scoring Brexit.
But O'Leary also suggests that Walsh has his own motives for painting such a positive picture for IAG.
"Willie has to play the game, which is ‘it will all be solved and nice' and 'Theresa May will deliver us a deeper and 
special bloody partnership', which doesn’t mean anything," he says.
This prompted Walsh to further clarify his reasons for his optimism on a smooth Brexit, particularly on the issue of 
IAG’s ownership structure, reminding the audience that he and his company are European, and not British, despite 
its biggest airline being British Airways.
"I’m not British, I'm Irish," Walsh notes. "I work for a Spanish company. I have airlines operating in Spain, France, 
Ireland, the UK. I’ve got a big operation in Poland where we do all of our general support for the business.
"I have a European company. And the EU must be acting in my interests as a European company. And I’m sure 
they will. And the idea that Aer Lingus is not an Irish company or Iberia is not a Spanish company is just a 
nonsense – they are. They clearly are. Aer Lingus is an Irish company; [its] principle place of business is Ireland. It 
services Ireland, [and] it is run from Dublin. Same for Iberia – [it] is Spanish."
But whatever the differences in opinion on how the UK’s departure from the EU will play out, Spohr summed up the 
airline chiefs' sentiment towards Brexit as a concept: "As I said on the morning it happened, as a European I think 
it’s terrible."

showed that Europe’s biggest airlines can agree on so....
But Lufthansa Group chief executive Carsten Spohr agrees with O’Leary regarding the potential for disruption to 
have a positive impact: "In theory, if we could use this industry to prove to the British how wrong their decision was, 
that might even be a good thing."
FAKE NEWS?
IAG chief executive Willie Walsh takes a different view, however. He is confident that a UK-EU agreement on 
aviation will be reached, and even labelled British newspaper the Financial Times the "Fake Times" for a story 
suggesting IAG is not prepared for Brexit.
"I'm a firm believer that this will get resolved,” Walsh states. “There’s no better industry at dealing with disruption 
than ours, [and] there's not a lot that needs to be sorted out."
Walsh was supported in his optimism about a smooth road towards Brexit by Air France-KLM chief executive Jean-
Marc Janaillac. He cites the example of Air France’s experience when an open skies agreement with the USA 
lapsed.
"I don’t believe there will be a problem," Janaillac says. "For example, some years ago, the agreement between 
France and the USA stopped and was not replaced because they didn’t agree, and the flights kept going. They 
found a temporary solution."
He goes on to suggest that there are plenty of precedents for the shape of the UK’s future relationship with the EU.
"We have many examples of different status, like with Norway, like with Switzerland, like with Canada and so on, to 
find a way of settlement between the UK and Europe. So I don’t see any great problem next year."
Asked whether he was concerned about Brexit’s impact on Virgin Atlantic – in which Air France-KLM is finalising a 
31% stake – Janaillac drew laughter by saying: "As for Virgin Atlantic, we rely on negotiations of Willie [Walsh]. We 
are, for once, behind IAG."
Walsh meanwhile expresses confidence that the UK will reach a new air services agreement with the USA. British 
Airways’ home country currently relies on its EU membership for its rights to serve US routes.
"There will be an agreement between the UK and the US. That will be a comprehensive open skies agreement," he 
states. "Anybody who doesn’t believe that is living in cloud cuckoo land.
"The UK government is determined to reach an agreement with the US. The US government is determined to reach 
an agreement with the UK. And that’s what will happen."
OTHER FORCES
Spohr notes, however, that there are forces beyond economic common sense at work when it comes to Brexit.
"In politics, there are things bigger than the economies and industry," he states. "This Brexit, none of us wanted it. 
[But] there is a tough negotiation going on and they all have sharp weapons in their pockets, and aviation is a sharp 
weapon.
"The French and the Germans, who are trying to keep Europe together, surely know that aviation can be used to 
put pressure on the British."
Those "sharp weapons" might be a strict insistence on majority-EU-ownership of airlines in the event of a "hard 
Brexit", or threats to restrict rights to fly between the UK and EU countries, for example.
Lundgren takes a different view to Spohr, however, suggesting disruption would not be in anyone's interests.
ANALYSIS: Airline chiefs disagree on chances of Brexit disruption E The A4E Aviation Summit in early March 
showed that Europe’s biggest airlines can agree on so....
"It would be inconceivable for me that there would be any politicians out there that would want to see planes being 
grounded," Lundgren states. "Everybody, I’m sure, is engaging with everybody to ensure that [a comprehensive 
agreement] happens."
O’Leary was quick to disagree in typically outspoken fashion.
"I think there is going to be a real crisis," O’Leary asserts. "I believe there will be disruption in flights between the 
UK and Europe. I think partly because it is in the German and French interest to push the ownership issue to the 
maximum extent."
Walsh hit back at this, saying "I don’t think it’s an issue that’s in the interests of France". He cites the fact that KLM 
"serves more UK cities than I do" to demonstrate that most stakeholders in Europe would want to avoid a messy, 
point-scoring Brexit.
But O'Leary also suggests that Walsh has his own motives for painting such a positive picture for IAG.
"Willie has to play the game, which is ‘it will all be solved and nice' and 'Theresa May will deliver us a deeper and 
special bloody partnership', which doesn’t mean anything," he says.
This prompted Walsh to further clarify his reasons for his optimism on a smooth Brexit, particularly on the issue of 
IAG’s ownership structure, reminding the audience that he and his company are European, and not British, despite 
its biggest airline being British Airways.
"I’m not British, I'm Irish," Walsh notes. "I work for a Spanish company. I have airlines operating in Spain, France, 
Ireland, the UK. I’ve got a big operation in Poland where we do all of our general support for the business.
"I have a European company. And the EU must be acting in my interests as a European company. And I’m sure 
they will. And the idea that Aer Lingus is not an Irish company or Iberia is not a Spanish company is just a 
nonsense – they are. They clearly are. Aer Lingus is an Irish company; [its] principle place of business is Ireland. It 
services Ireland, [and] it is run from Dublin. Same for Iberia – [it] is Spanish."
But whatever the differences in opinion on how the UK’s departure from the EU will play out, Spohr summed up the 
airline chiefs' sentiment towards Brexit as a concept: "As I said on the morning it happened, as a European I think 
it’s terrible."

Virgin Atlantic is fighting back against the rise of low-cost competitors with its first hand-baggage only ticket for 
those wanting a cheap flight across the Atlantic.
The UK carrier, founded by Richard Branson, yesterday announced plans to launch three new economy fares as it 
looks to defend its position in the market from long-haul budget rivals such as Norwegian Air Shuttle.
Traditional transatlantic carriers are under increasing pressure from lowcost airlines such as Norwegian and 
WestJet, which have disrupted the market for long-haul travel in the way that Ryanair and easyJet have done for 
short-haul in Europe.
Craig Kreeger, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, said its economy revamp would give it the capability to offer a very 
low fare that would be "intensely competitive."
"We don't feel we need to create a new airline, we feel we can offer a great Virgin experience at a price people 
wouldn't necessarily expect," he said.
Norwegian, in particular, has become a force in the European airline industry over the past few years, bringing 
down the cost of long-haul flying and forcing rivals to respond with their own budget services.
Virgin revamps transatlantic economy travel Airlines
Last year, International Airlines Group, which owns British Airways, launched Level, a low-cost transatlantic brand 
in response to this competition. Last week, the group also announced that, from April, it would introduce a basic 
hand baggage-only fare for transatlantic flights on BA and Iberia, its Spanish airline brand.
Yesterday, Virgin Atlantic outlined plans to compete on similar ground, offering three new economy price tiers: 
"economy delight", "economy classic" and "economy light".
Its most expensive economy ticket - economy delight - will give travellers a more spacious seat with 34 inch 
legroom, priority check-in and boarding as well as advanced seat assignment. Its cheapest ticket - economy light - 
will see seats assigned at check-in and no checked luggage. Seats will be packed closer together with 31 inch 
legroom. All flyers will continue to get inclusive food and drink and in-flight entertainment.

the US carrier, which took a 49 per cent stake in the company in 2012.
In a further shake-up in July, Virgin Atlantic announced that Air France-KLM was buying a 31 per cent stake in the 
airline as part of a plan to create "the most comprehensive transatlantic route network".

Ryanair signed a deal on Thursday recognising Italian pilots union ANPAC as part of talks across Europe aimed at 
averting strike action.
Pilots in two of the airline's largest markets - Britain and Italy - have reached agreement with management. The 
Irish budget airline said the two markets represent more than 45% of its pilots.
"This agreement validates the decision in December to recognise unions. We are making good progress with 
unions in other major EU countries and we hope to sign more recognition deals with pilots and cabin crew unions 
over the coming weeks and months," Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said in a statement. &#8203; (Reuters)

The chief executive of Aer Lingus-owner IAG is confident a deal will be done to secure Britain's flying rights after 
Brexit, he said on Tuesday, dismissing a recent media report and a rival airline's prediction of disruption.
IAG's Willie Walsh told the Airlines For Europe conference that he expects Britain to secure deals to allow planes to 
keep flying and that he is relaxed about Brexit.
"I am a firm believer that this will get resolved," Walsh said on a panel.
He dismissed a report in Britain's Financial Times newspaper on Tuesday that said the United States had offered 
Britain a worse deal than it has under the EU-U.S. Open Skies agreement.
"The people who are involved in the negotiations say we're going to get a deal," Walsh said.
"There will be a comprehensive Open Skies agreement. Anyone who doesn't believe that is living in cloud cuckoo 
land."
Ryanair's chief executive was less optimistic, however, saying he expects disruption to flights between Britain and 
the rest of Europe in the immediate aftermath of Britain's planned exit from the European Union on March 29 next 
year.
"I think there will be a real crisis in April 2019. I believe there will be disruption to flights between the UK and 
Europe," Michael O'Leary told the conference.
Aer Lingus owner IAG confident of post-Brexit flying rights
After Brexit, British airlines want to be able to continue to benefit from EU flying rights and the British government 
has said it will try to secure an open-access deal.
Flying rights to, from and within the European Union, as well as between the United States and Britain, are currently 
covered by EU-wide Open Skies agreements.
Britain needs to agree new deals because, without membership of the EU, the country's aviation sector does not 
have a natural fallback arrangement that will keep airlines flying.
Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said on the sidelines of the conference that he expected a longer transition period 
would be needed because of complexities of the overall Brexit process. (Reuters)

The European Union will use upcoming trade talks with the UK to seek to avoid the "particularly absurd" prospect of 
flights between the two blocs being disrupted following Brexit, European Council president Donald Tusk says.
In a speech today laying out the European Union’s negotiating stance in upcoming trade talks with the UK, Tusk 
says that the two parties "must start discussions on this [flight disruption] issue as soon as possible".
Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary has previously warned that a ‘hard’ Brexit could result in a temporary 
disruption of flights between the UK and EU – a scenario which the European Commission’s director-general for 
Mobility and Transport Henrik Hololei told FlightGlobal on 6 March was not "impossible" to envisage.
Tusk says that as a result of the UK government’s plan to leave the EU’s single market, the customs union and the 
jurisdiction of European Court of Justice, this left the option of seeking to conclude a trade agreement with the UK 
"covering all sectors and with zero tariffs on goods".
The EU will also require an air transport agreement, combined with an aviation safety agreement, to ensure a 
"strong level playing field in a highly competitive sector".
In a joint statement airport associations ACI Europe and the AOA welcomed the comments "This charts the way 
forward for the future aviation relationship and thus potentially reduces uncertainty for our sector," it says.
"We call both on EU27 and UK negotiators to seek a future agreement that mirrors as closely as possible today’s 
arrangements. We note that the draft EU guidelines do not consider the rights of UK airlines to keep flying within the 
EU27 nor the right of EU27 airlines to keep flying within the UK, as a result of the UK leaving the single aviation 
market," they add.

LOW-COST carrier Ryanair is braced for some flight disruption over Easter and potentially over the summer months 
as it aims to press on with union negotiationss.
The airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary told a news conference yesterday he expected some impact on flights 
- specifically into and out of Ireland and Portugal - as Ryanair hashes out the details of union recognition and how it 
will work with pilot unions.
"We are very close to concluding agreements in Spain and Italy and expect them to be finalised within the next 
month," Reuters reported O'Leary telling the news conference in Brussels.
"We're not making as much progress in other countries, most notably Ireland, and in Portugal. We expect some 
disruptions, possibly over Easter, maybe over the summer period," he said.
Last year, Ryanair cancelled a raft of flights in September when it faced pilot rostering troubles, with a number of 
routes then suspended. The airline managed to quell a threat of strikes over the festive period, agreeing to 
recognise unions. In January, it struck a deal to recognise the British Airline Pilots Association as the sole 
representative body for Ryanair pilots in the UK.
And at the beginning of the year, Ryanair said pilots across all 15 of its UK bases had accepted a pay rise. The 
airline said pilots had voted in a secret ballot to back pay increases of up to 20 per cent.
However, last month, O'Leary faced a call from pilot group the European Employee Representative Council (EERC) 
calling on him to resign.

Ryanair though said the EERC has "no legal standing or validity".

This Environmental Policy illustrates Ryanair's commitment to managing its impact on the environment by: Leading 
the way as Europe's greenest, cleanest airline Committing to ambitious environmental targets Investing billions in 
the newest, most fuel efficient aircraft Committing to eliminate all non-recyclable plastics within 5 years Allowing 
customers to offset the carbon cost of their flightsRyanair's Kenny Jacobs said:"As Europe's greenest airline, we 
are pleased to launch our Environmental Policy, a blueprint for our achievements to date and future targets. 
Operating the youngest fleet in Europe, high load factors and efficient fuel burn, has enabled us to continuously 
lower our CO2 emissions to become the greenest airline in Europe. 
Furthermore, customers can now offset the carbon cost of their flight by making a voluntary donation to a climate 
charity at the end of the booking process, and we have committed to going plastic free across our operations over 
the next five years."Ryanair's COO Peter Bellew said:"We are pleased to launch our Environmental Policy, which 
cements our commitment to continuously improving the carbon efficiency of our operations. By minimising fuel and 
energy consumption, reducing noise pollution and relentlessly supporting global emissions targets, we will play our

 Irish budget airline Ryanair's marketing director warned on Tuesday that unions may disrupt their move to fill the 
gap in the market left by insolvent flight company Air Berlin.
"When you now have unions and you have union recognition, you can have some disruption," said Kenny Jacobs at 
a press conference in Berlin.
"We haven't had that yet, but we are saying it can happen at some point in the future."
Ryanair is planning to expand the number of services it runs to and from German airports from 24 to 243 by next 
winter.
This year the company aims to see a 13% increase of passengers flying from German airports, with the total rising 
to 19.7 million.
The airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary is due to meet German aviation union Vereinigung Cockpit.
In December, Ryanair agreed to recognize pilot unions for the first time as part of efforts to avoid planned strike 
action during the Christmas holiday season.
Various European budget airlines have made overtures to fill the gap left by the dissolution of German flight 
company Air Berlin after it stopped trading last October.
According to Lufthansa sister company Eurowings' own information, the firm plans to roll its service out with another 
70,000 flights carrying an additional 8 million passengers this year.

A connection deal between Ryanair and IAG's Aer Lingus could serve as a model for future cooperation between 
Europe's largest low-cost airline and long-haul carriers, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said on Tuesday.
Ryanair and Aer Lingus have signed a co-operation agreement to offer connecting flights on each other's services, 
Aer Lingus's CEO was quoted as saying on Sunday.
"I would hope that at some stage next summer, you will see us feeding Aer Lingus' transatlantic flights out of Dublin, 
and once we've done it once, I think we will provide a significant feed to lots of long-haul airlines," O'Leary told a 
news conference in Brussels.
O'Leary said there were still some issues to be resolved for the deal to go into force with Aer Lingus, especially 
finding a solution to using different reservation systems.
While transatlantic routes are among the industry's most popular and profitable, short-haul routes within Europe are 
often less attractive to operate as low-cost competition depresses ticket prices.
In response, airlines such as Lufthansa have established their own no-frills brands to reduce the cost of short-haul 
routes.
O'Leary said Ryanair was already in talks with other airlines to introduce connection deals.
"We're in talks with lots of other airlines about feeds," O'Leary said.

Ryanair expects some disruption to flights in the coming months, notably into and out of Ireland and Portugal, as it 
discusses union recognition and working with pilot unions, chief executive Michael O'Leary said on Tuesday.
The airline averted widespread strikes ahead of Christmas by announcing plans to recognise pilots' unions for the 
first time in its 32-year history and is talking with unions across Europe on formal recognition.
"We are very close to concluding agreements in Spain and Italy and expect them to be finalised within the next 
month," O'Leary told a news conference in Brussels.
"We're not making as much progress in other countries, most notably Ireland and in Portugal. We expect some 
disruptions, possibly over Easter, maybe over the summer period," he said.
Chief Operations Officer Peter Bellew said at a separate news conference in Berlin that Ryanair expected to 
achieve a collective wage agreement in Germany over the coming months.
A meeting has been scheduled with German pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) for next week, he said.
The union had called the first-ever pilots strike at Ryanair in December, saying it did not believe Ryanair was 
serious about negotiating with unions.
Ryanair has not yet sought similar collective agreements with staff other than pilots, though Bellew said there had 
been some early discussions with unions representing cabin crew. (Reuters)

Irish budget airline Ryanair's marketing director warned on Tuesday that unions may disrupt their move to fill the 
gap in the market left by insolvent flight company Air Berlin.
"When you now have unions and you have union recognition, you can have some disruption," said Kenny Jacobs at 
a press conference in Berlin.
"We haven't had that yet, but we are saying it can happen at some point in the future."
Ryanair is planning to expand the number of services it runs to and from German airports from 24 to 243 by next 
winter.
This year the company aims to see a 13-per-cent increase of passengers flying from German airports, with the total 
rising to 19.7 million.
The airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary is due to meet German aviation union Vereinigung Cockpit.
In December Ryanair agreed to recognize pilot unions for the first time as part of efforts to avoid planned strike 
action during the Christmas holiday season.
Various European budget airlines have made overtures to fill the gap left by the dissolution of German flight 
company Air Berlin after it stopped trading last October.
According to Lufthansa sister company Eurowings' own information, the firm plans to roll its service out with another 
70,000 flights carrying an additional 8 million passengers this year.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary today acknowledged a "somewhat stark" situation as the UK moves 
towards its exit from the European Union, and highlighted that the Irish carrier's ownership structure would need to 
be addressed in the event of a "hard Brexit".
Speaking in Brussels as the airline launched several Belgian routes, O'Leary said: "It appears to me that the 
Europeans, on the prompting of the Germans and the French, will insist on a strict application of the ownership 
rules."
He notes that "about 60-65%" of Ryanair's shareholding would be non-EU after a hard Brexit.
In such an outcome – where the UK effectively becomes a third-party state with no continuing access to the EU's 
common aviation area – majority UK-owned airlines would theoretically lose the right to serve EU destinations.
Ryanair would be faced with two options, O'Leary suggests: it could restrict the voting rights of its non-EU 
shareholders, or it could force them to sell their shares.
"We won't know until we get much closer to the date of the eventual Brexit termination," O'Leary adds.
The UK government has insisted it wants to retain a close aviation relationship with the EU post-Brexit and stated 
there will be no disruption to services. As with most issues relating to the UK's exit from the EU, however, detailed 
plans either do not exist or are being kept under wraps during the negotiation process.
Brexit situation 'stark' but UK could remain in EU: Ryanair chief; Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary today 
acknowledged a "somewhat stark" situation as th....
O'Leary describes Brexit as "the stupidest idea known to humankind – the first time in history people have voted to 
get poorer or be less well off, despite the rantings of the Daily Mail and some of those other people". He believes 
the UK's decision to leave the EU could still be reversed, however.
"I think there's a real prospect that the closer we get to the real Brexit termination that people in the UK will 
reconsider their position," he says.

After an exceptionally busy December for firm commitments, preliminary figures from Flight Fleets Analyzer show 
that 2018 began with a relatively quiet start in terms of commercial aircraft orders.
Manufacturers logged a total of 37 net orders in January: 27 more than the 10 units recorded in the same month a 
year earlier. The new commitments were headed by China Aircraft Leasing (CALC), which placed an order for 15 
Airbus A320neo-family aircraft, with Nordic Aviation Capital signing for the same total number of airframes, split 
between 12 ATR 42s and three ATR 72s.
The order from CALC was the only narrowbody deal recorded for the month in Fleets Analyzer figures, with the 15-
unit total again beating last year’s January performance of just seven single-aisles. Last December, the lessor took 
delivery of its first A320neo, with the twinjet now in use with US carrier Frontier Airlines.
No commercial order activity occurred in the widebody sector during January, making it the first monthly dry spell 
for orders in that category since August 2017.
In the regional sector, Nordic Aviation Capital’s ATR buy was boosted by aerial firefighting firm Conair’s order for six 
new-build Bombardier Q400s that will be used as multirole aerial firefighting aircraft. Toronto-based Longview 
Aviation Asset Management ordered a single Viking Air Series 400 Twin Otter.
At the end of January, the overall commercial aircraft order backlog stood at 15,212; down 21 from the previous 
month.
Fleets Analyzer information shows that 78 commercial aircraft were delivered in January, four fewer than during the 
same month in 2017. The reduced volume of shipments also represented the lowest total from within the last 13 
months, with 2018’s slow start following a record year for both Airbus and Boeing.
A quiet Neo year for orders; 2018 got off to a sedate start, with sales covering only a handful of narrowbodies 
and no widebodies , while deliveries also slippe....
Operators in the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 29 of the aircraft shipped during the month, while mainline 
operations represented more than half of the deliveries made.
There were 51 narrowbody and 19 widebody aircraft delivered in January, while regional jets and turboprops 
accounted for five and three units, respectively. Ryanair took delivery of six Boeing 737NGs, boosting its fleet of the 
type to more than 420 units. Southwest Airlines and Xiamen Airlines also took three 737NGs each, while Batik Air 
and Saudia each received three A320ceos.
Deliveries in the widebody sector for January included two 777s received by Air India, a pair of A350s taken by Thai 
Airways and two 787s shipped to United Airlines.
Regional deliveries included Aeroflot receiving a trio of Sukhoi Superjet 100s, and both KLM Cityhopper and 
SkyWest Airlines taking a single Embraer 175. Longview Aviation Asset Management received two Twin Otters, 
while a single ATR 72 was shipped to Alliance Air.
Fleets Analyzer data shows that the global in-service commercial fleet is approaching the 28,500 unit mark. More 
than 26,000 of this total are aircraft deployed in a passenger role, with the remainder being used for 
cargo operations.
Narrowbody aircraft are gradually expanding their overall share of the active fleet, now accounting for nearly 55% of 
the commercial in-service aircraft.
The fleet operated by carriers in the Asia-Pacific region accounts for 30% of the global in-service total, with 8,610 
units – now 170 more than the North American-based inventory, which had been the largest until late last year.
CALC has ordered 15 more A320neos after leasing its first of the type to Frontier Airlines

Ryanair and IAG's Aer Lingus have signed a co-operation agreement to offer connecting flights on each other's 
services, the Aer Lingus CEO was quoted as saying on Sunday.
In a first for Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline will feed passengers from some of its European routes onto its 
Irish rival's transatlantic services, while Aer Lingus will connect ontoRyanair services to various European 
destinations.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary had long been opposed to selling journeys involving connecting flights but 
the company started trials on Ryanair-only connections last year.
"We will trial it in the marketplace. If it's successful, we will live with the problems of success. If not, we will learn the 
lessons and move on," Aer Lingus Chief Executive Stephen Kavanagh told Britain's Sunday Times newspaper.
Ryanair chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs last week said that the company hoped to start operating connecting 
flights with Aer Lingus this year.
The Sunday Times said the service will be packaged by a third-party intermediary that will also offer passengers 
connection insurance to cover missed onward flights.
The risk of having to compensate passengers for missed connections was one of Ryanair's main reasons for 
shunning the idea of offering feeder flights for long-haul routes.
The Irish airline last year ended talks with Norwegian Air Shuttle on a similar arrangement. (Reuters)

Highlight: As we learned during the Beast from the East, impulse decisions made out of fear do not make for good 
outcomes - and the same goes for betting 
Body
Last week’s hysterical reaction of the Irish masses to a bit of snow betrayed a herd mentality that astute investors 
will recognise instinctively. Images of supermarket shelves purged of all sliced bread suggested another coming of 
the Emergency. It emphasised the poor diet of people in this country and also that when fear battles with logic, logic 
tends to lose.
The clamour to stock up on bread recalled Michael O’Leary’s astute reaction to the 9/11 attacks or, more 
accurately, his retention of logic when others were acting irrationally through fear. Ryanair placed a mammoth 
aircraft order in the immediate aftermath of the event, achieving huge discounts from Boeing during a global 
aviation downturn caused by US tourists’ fears of further attacks.
Bookmakers introduced a cash-out facility in recent years which amounts to genius. It allows a punter whose bet’s 
prospects have improved since it was placed to lock in a profit. For example, if one backed Shamrock Rovers to 
beat Dundalk pre-game, one could cash out after Rovers went a goal ahead.
The cash-out option preys on human fear. Bettors do not want to lose; very many will happily accept an outcome 
which guarantees profit - even if logic dictates they should wait it out and accept the risk that the bet loses.
O’Leary owns Samcro, considered one of the brightest jumping prospects we have seen this century, and a horse 
whose odds for the Sean Mulryan-sponsored Ballymore Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham next week have contracted 
to 4/6 with Paddy Power, having been 16/1. Rather than risk his defeat, those who backed him several months ago 
can now avail of the cash-out option, even if that is exactly what the bookmaker would want you to do.
O’Leary has continuously and mischievously played Samcro’s ability down, to the extent that his trainer Gordon 
Elliott quipped last Sunday: “The way Michael is talking, you’d wonder will we have a winner at all at Cheltenham.”
Upping the Ante: Don’t panic - buy at the bookies and use your loaf
Elliott and I spent last Tuesday at a Cheltenham preview night in Leixlip, which attracted a decent crowd despite the 
snow. Elliott gave his time for nothing on the evening, which is exceedingly rare, as jockeys or trainers can charge 
four-figure sums for the pleasure of their input at a preview night nowadays.
Horsemen are now accustomed to O’Leary’s aversion to the only race of the 28 that takes place on the flat at the 
Cheltenham Festival, the Wetherbys Champion Bumper. O’Leary loves a Cheltenham winner, but has never had 
one in the bumper - and given that he buys horses to be steeplechasers, its relevance is minor in the bigger picture.
O’Leary’s Gigginstown stud has run 50 bumper horses in Ireland this season so far, winning 16 races. Its number of 
bumper runners in Britain is just nine since the operation was formed, and O’Leary has never seen one of those 
finish higher than third.
The panel, with his exception, having discussed the bumper on Tuesday, Elliott was asked more out of courtesy 
than any other consideration if he had a view, and he surprised the audience by saying that Felix Desjy was a 
certain runner.
Felix Desjy is partly forgotten, since his last outing was when scoring at Down Royal on November 3. Patrick 
Mullins - who has partnered very many top-class bumper steeds for his father Willie - rode him then and was 
subsequently effusive in his praise.
Davy Condon, Elliott’s assistant, gushed post-race: “He is very smart and is learning the whole time. He’s improved 
a lot since [his last run] and is really a horse to look forward to.”
Bookmakers are a generous 20/1 about Felix Desjy triumphing on Wednesday week, probably on the basis he 
would not run. O’Leary plays a game of risk versus reward, and is evidently confident the prospects of the latter are 
favourable enough to take a punt.
“He’s not a horse we are likely to do a lot with this season: he is one for the future,” Condon added in November. 
For the Elliott-O’Leary axis, it seems, and all those who panic-bought bad bread, the future is now.

Highlight: Every business wants to get more value out of the data they use and the best way to do so is to align it 
with your business objectives, writes Quinton O’Reilly 
Body
Data and value should go hand in hand whenever you deal with analytics. The analytics and big data industry has 
taken a more considered approach with data, focusing on quality over quantity.
Such tools are becoming smarter, yet it still relies on businesses aligning their aims and objectives with the data 
they’re analysing, according to the chief operating officer of DNM Group, Richard Nunan.
“We always try to identify value streams within the business and we try to align the value streams to the data points 
and people are bought in once they can see value. That’s your starting point,” he said.
“Once we can prove the value, it’s up to us to make sure we maintain the cleaning storage, and processing of the 
data to make sure that value remains consistent. When big data can provide value within a value stream, you can 
convert that into an operational data stream so it becomes an actual solution. It’s a longer strategic solution, but it 
becomes an actual part of the business to generate revenue.”
Like many other industries, the general hype around services like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and 
other similar features can end up clouding what can be achieved. A case of being distracted by the square peg 
when you need to cover a round hole.
This kind of learning, training your customers to move around the site to find the things that they want, that’s 
machine learning in itself. We’re seeing good movements there.
Nunan sees the benefits of these type of technologies, especially machine learning which he sees as the model that 
better suits big data.
Looking for the value
“With machine learning, you have predefined algorithms that people can reuse and have already been proven 
within the business,” he said. “If you’re trying to get automated recommendations, from Amazon to DoneDeal, there 
are recommendations people make based on their behaviours on their sites.
“This kind of learning, training your customers to move around the site to find the things that they want, that’s 
machine learning in itself. We’re seeing good movements there.”
There are a number of practical examples out there of companies using machine learning to better shape their 
experiences. Nunan mentions the example of Ryanair Rooms, the airline’s service for comparing hotel prices, which 
takes your searches and history and combines them with other data points like flights and cities visited.
“We can see certain people within the tourism industry are starting to build your holiday profile in the background 
based on all the decisions you made in the last three or four years,” he said. “It’s very simple, you can see the 
concept with Ryanair Rooms where 10 per cent of your flight is free if you book your hotel through them, so you can 
see the model.
“What they’re really doing is they’re going to capture all of this information about you on which countries you like, 
which hotels you like, which flights you book, and destinations [you visit], so when you log on to their site, it’s going 
to be telling you what your next holiday is without you realising it.
“That’s what they’re doing in the background and you can see those types of trends start to happen.”

GENEVA (AP) - The Latest on the wintry weather hitting Europe (all times local):
4:05 p.m.
Winter weather is halting all flights in and out of Dublin Airport, with authorities saying they are unlikely to resume 
until Saturday.
The airport says Aer Lingus, Ryanair and other carriers are suspending operations Thursday afternoon as Ireland 
braces for a fierce storm. It says airlines "are likely to resume operations on Saturday morning."
Irish Rail also says no trains are likely to run until Saturday.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has urged people to get home by 4 p.m. Thursday and stay home until the storm 
has passed. He says the forecast predicts blizzards, 100 kph (60 mph) winds, zero visibility and deep pockets of 
snow.
Varadkar says "the risk to life and limb presented by severe weather conditions should not be underestimated."

3:50 p.m.
The World Health Organization says the cold weather hitting Europe poses health risks, particularly to people in 
vulnerable situations.
The agency's European head, Zsuzsanna Jakab, says the cold, even when not at its peak, "can be harmful to 
people's health in many ways."
Jakab says it "can aggravate existing conditions and raise the risk of increased blood pressure, heart attacks and 
strokes."

She said that "frequently, poor households are the hardest hit" because low income people "can least afford to 
adequately heat their homes. Homeless people, and refugees and migrants can be especially vulnerable. Their risk 
increases if they lack proper clothing, food and medical care."

Officials say Geneva's airport has reopened after teams scrambled to de-ice planes, tarmacs and other facilities 
that had led to a several-hour shutdown following sudden snowfall overnight.
The officials warned of continued delays, however, after 13 centimeters (about 5 inches) of snow landed in the early 
morning hours, and advised passengers to check with their airlines.
Geneva airport director Andre Schneider pointed to a combination of a string of very-cold days that hardened the 
ground and a slight melting of the snow, which then froze and iced up airport facilities, runways and tarmacs.
He said the real problem was a lack of friction on the ground to allow planes to move around, land or take off.
"When there is ice underneath, we actually need to get rid of the ice," he said.
"That's actually quite complicated, because we can either use special equipment which blows hot air on it, or use 
chemicals. But it's not as quick as just pushing off the snow."

Macedonia's government has urged employers to exempt pregnant women and people aged over 60 from work for 
a day due to the freezing conditions.
The lowest temperature in Macedonia on Thursday was minus 18 Celsius (-0.4 Fahrenheit) recorded near the 
border with Bulgaria.
A government agency also issued a recommendation for construction companies to reduce working hours, secure 
heated areas for outdoor workers and allow them half-hour breaks every two hours.
No deaths have been reported so far in Macedonia due to the cold.
The national meteorological agency said the cold is expected to ease during the weekend.

A woman, who had left her home at a Swedish asylum center with her daughter and son, aged 8 and 9, 
respectively, has been pronounced dead after being found in a southern Sweden forest.
The Aftonbladet daily newspaper said the woman who died Thursday in hospital was "poorly dressed" and that her 
daughter was in intensive care but not in a life-threatening condition.
The son was found safe and sound Wednesday afternoon.
Temperatures in the region were about -10 degrees Celsius (14 Fahrenheit).
Aftonbladet said a helicopter search had been called off Wednesday because of poor visibility.

Danish police say that an 84-year-old woman with dementia has become the second person to die in Denmark 
because of the cold weather.
Police say she left her home Wednesday evening and was found Thursday in a park in Roskilde, west of 
Copenhagen. The woman wasn't identified in line with Danish practice.
Southern Denmark has been hit by heavy snowfall and local police have urged motorists not to use their cars.
In neighboring Sweden, the Transport Administration said people should think twice before taking their cars in areas 
affected by heavy snowfall and snowdrifts, adding "it is difficult to predict which areas will get the most snow."
Sweden's emergency service said it had received about 550 calls regarding minor road crashes as of Thursday 
morning in the past three days, twice as much as for an ordinary winter day.

Braving an Arctic blast sweeping across Europe, about two dozen officials from the Paris region have spent a frigid 
night outdoors to call attention to the plight of the homeless.
Snow began falling before they closed their eyes early Thursday near the Austerlitz train station. The city was 
blanketed in white by daybreak.
Dragging blankets and sleeping bags, numerous officials, from an array of political parties, wore their blue, white 
and red sashes, France's national colors, denoting their status.
At least 13 homeless have died in the Paris region since Jan. 1.
Mama Sy, deputy mayor of Etampes, south of Paris, and organizer, said that "it's out of the question" that the 6,000 
places opened for the homeless because of frigid weather disappear when temperatures rise.
--This item has been corrected to show that the deputy mayor's surname is Sy, not Si.

Roads and airports across large chunks of Britain are closed as snow and wind wreak havoc with travel plans.
Hundreds of drivers were trapped in their cars overnight in Scotland, where authorities said everyone except 
emergency-services workers should stay off the roads. The snow shut Glasgow and Edinburgh airports, and there 
are cancellations at Heathrow and other airports in England.
Police in the county of Lincolnshire in eastern England say most roads there are impassable, with as much as 2 feet 
(60 centimeters) of snow in rural areas.
Several people have died across Europe as the continent endures unusually cold late-winter weather. The fatalities 
include a man in his 60s who was pronounced dead after being pulled from a frozen lake in London on Wednesday, 
the ambulance service said.
Forecasters say a new storm is due to bring blizzards, freezing rain and thunderstorms to Ireland, southwestern 
England and Wales on Thursday.

Unusual snow in parts of France has disrupted flights, stranded drivers on highways and caused school closures.
The state meteorological agency put about half the country on alert Thursday for dangerous levels of snow, ice, 
floods or strong winds.
Snow blanketed Paris and the surrounding region, and authorities urged Paris commuters to leave their cars at 
home because of dangerous conditions.
The snowfall stretched across a swath of northern France and also reached as far south as Montpellier near the 
Mediterranean. Airports in Montpellier and the Atlantic beach resort of Biarritz were among those seeing disruptions 
because of the snow.
Television broadcast images of people trapped in their cars on snow-covered highways in the area, where snow is 
extremely rare.

8:55 a.m.
Geneva's airport has been closed "until further notice" after the Swiss city was blanketed by snowfall overnight.
The airport's website says passengers should stay away for the time being and recommends they check with their 
airlines to see if their flights are still scheduled for departure.
Airport spokesman Sebastien Leprat said initial targets to re-open around 9 a.m. (0800GMT) had been pushed 
back by one hour, and that no formal decision had been made to resume traffic.
He said tricky weather conditions across Europe could cause extended delays.
Meteorologist Dominique Stussi of national weather service MeteoSuisse said 13 centimeters (about 5 inches) fell 
over a three-hour period in the early morning.

Ryanair intends to exercise 100 Max options

Ryanair intends to exercise “pretty much all” of its options for 100 additional Boeing Max 200s on top of its firm 
order for 100 of the aircraft, reports Reuters.
The Irish budget carrier made the order and was the launch customer for the aircraft in 2014.
“I expect we will exercise pretty much all of these options as they come due to exercise two years prior to delivery,” 
Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary told a news conference in Brussels.
In February, industry analysts told Airfinance Journal that Ryanair’s ongoing pilot strikes and labour issues would 
not change the fundamentals of its low-fare business model, although they couldmake the economics of the airline 
less attractive for investors.
“This concept that there is a structural shift in the industry between Ryanair and the competition is just a misleading 
view,” said Goodbody Stockbrokers analyst Mark Simpson in a phone interview.
“If you look at where the cost differentials stand, let's say between itself and Easyjet, the difference given the view 
of an increased cost on labour would narrow from a &euro;4 differential in labour costs to, let's say, a just-under-
&euro;3 differential, but the total unit cost differential is &euro;24.”

Irish carrier Ryanair has entered into a binding agreement with Niki Lauda to support his plan to develop and grow 
Laudamotion, the Austrian carrier based in Vienna.
Under this agreement Ryanair will acquire an initial 24.9% stake in Laudamotion. The Irish carrier says the initial 
stake will rise as soon as possible to 75% subject to EU Competition approval.
Niki Lauda will chair the board of the airline and oversee the implementation of his strategy to build a successful 
Austrian low fares airline. Ryanair will provide financial and management support to Laudamotion as well as six 
wet-lease aircraft for the summer 2018 season to enable Laudamotion to complete an extensive 21 aircraft flying 
programme.
The cost of this 75% investment in Laudamotion (if approved by the EU) will be less than &euro;50 million ($61 
million), says Ryanair.
Ryanair will provide an additional &euro;50 million for the first year of operations. Both Lauda and Ryanair will work 
with the existing management team of Laudamotion and expect the airline to reach profitability by its third year of 
operations if their plan to grow the business to a fleet of at least 30 Airbus aircraft succeeds.
Laudamotion, owned by Niki Lauda, is an Austrian AOC holder that has recently acquired many of the assets, 
including A320 aircraft, of the former Niki Airline.
It will shortly start a range of scheduled and charter services from Germany, Austria and Switzerland primarily to 
Mediterranean leisure destinations.

Klarna, one of Europe's most highly valued fintech companies, reported a big jump in profits and sales last year as 
the online payments group had strong growth in the Nordics and Germany.
The Swedish group posted a 27 per cent increase in revenues to SKr4.53bn ($550m) while net profit more than 
tripled to SKr346m. It processed about (EURO)18bn in online transactions last year, an increase of 42 per cent.
Klarna provides payment products for transport, media companies and retailers by giving customers the option of 
paying after they receive their goods as well as taking on the credit risk.
Valued at $2.25bn in 2015, Klarna last June became the largest European fintech to receive a banking licence, with 
its chief executive Sebastian Siemiatkowski saying he wanted it to reshape retail banking in the same way Ryanair 
had shaken up the aviation sector.
The company's high-profile investors include venture capital groups Sequoia Capital and Atomico as well as Visa 
and private equity house Permira.
The group has made a big push into the US and UK but progress has been slow in what are highly competitive 
markets. Revenues for countries outside the Nordics, Germany, Austria and Switzerland increased from SKr145m 
in 2016 to SKr186m last year.
Sales soar at online payments group Klarna Financial services
Klarna has partnered with Asos, Topshop and JD Sports in the UK and Microsoft in the US as part of its efforts to 
expand outside northern Europe.
People close to Klarna say that the company saw especially good growth at the end of the year because of Black 
Friday and Christmas but that these do not show up in last year's results.
The increase in net profit was flattered by a drop in provisions to do with VAT reclassification in Sweden. In 2016, 
the provisions cut SKr166m from net profit while they reduced it by only SKr66m last year. Net profit increased by 
about 50 per cent stripping out the effect of the provisions.
Klarna intends to use its banking licence to offer products such as cards and salary accounts to its customers.

Ryanair nears deal with Italian pilots

 Ryanair and its Italian pilots union ANPAC said on Wednesday they were close to a deal on formal recognition and 
working conditions in what would be a major breakthrough in the airline's efforts to avoid strike action across 
Europe.
A deal in Italy would mean pilots in two of the airline's three largest markets - Britain, Italy and Spain - would have 
reached provisional agreement with management.
In Ryanair's biggest market, Britain's BALPA union signed a recognition deal in January andRyanair's Chief 
Operations Officer Peter Bellew on Tuesday said talks with the SELPA pilot union in its third biggest market in 
Spain were "very positive."
"Things are really going fast. At the next meeting we may be able to sign an agreement," ANPAC official Riccardo 
Canestrari told Reuters following a meeting with Ryanair management.
At a press conference in Rome, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said he hoped to sign an agreement at 
their next meeting with the airline's management in two weeks' time.
The airline averted widespread strikes ahead of Christmas by announcing plans to recognise pilots' unions for the 
first time in its 32-year history and is talking with unions across Europe on formal recognition.
But progress had been slow and O'Leary has warned that the company may face strike action at Easter or the 
summer.
Ryanair nears deal with Italian pilots
A union representing Ryanair cabin crew in Portugal this week announced it would hold three one-day strikes 
during the Easter holidays.
Management hopes that by reaching quick agreement with unions in its largest markets that it can avoid 
widespread disruption.
ANPAC's Canestrari said that the union was negotiating a common pay scale for Ryanair pilots across Italy, its 
second biggest market, as well as other working conditions such as tax, paternal leave and rostering.
He said his understanding was that on completion of the agreement, the union would become the only official 
representative body for Ryanair pilots in Italy, replacing the airline's Employee Representative Committees - a key 
demand by pilots in other jurisdictions.
The unofficial pan-European EERC body set up by pilots could have a role in pan-European questions like the 
transfer of pilots between jurisdictions, but primary negotiations on working conditions would take place with 
national unions, Canestrari said.
O'Leary said Ryanair was also negotiating with Italy's ANPAV flight assistants' union and hopes to reach a deal with 
them too shortly. (Reuters)

The move puts more than 300 jobs at risk, with Ryanair cutting the number of routes out of Glasgow from 23 to 
three.
It will move its Glasgow-based aircraft to Edinburgh and start 11 new routes, with five of the Glasgow International 
routes - Derry, Lisbon, Sofia, Riga and Berlin - switching to Edinburgh Airport.
Ryanair's chief commercial officer, David O'Brien said: "Ryanair regrets these cuts in the weaker Glasgow market 
where efforts to stimulate low fare demand are severely hampered by the continuing burden of APD."
"As a result, we will transfer our Glasgow International-based aircraft to Edinburgh in November where we will offer 
11 new low-fare routes (45 in total including London Stansted) and deliver over 3.5m passengers per annum at 
Edinburgh Airport," he added Sky News reported O'Brien sounding a warning over Brexit, as "particularly 
threatening to Scotland and its economy".
"The weaker Scottish economy is even weaker in Glasgow and we simply can't bear the air passenger duty of £13," 
he said.

A union representing Ryanair cabin crew in Portugal will hold three one-day strikes during the Easter holidays, on 
March 29, April 1 and April 4, an official with the SNPVAC union said on Monday.
The strikes are the latest sign of strained relations between Europe's largest low-cost carrier and its staff after it 
narrowly avoided mass Christmas strikes in December by recognising trade unions for the first time.
Fernando Gandra of Portugal's SNPVAC union told Reuters it had sent a notice of strike action to Ryanair and the 
Portuguese labour ministry. Ryanair said in an emailed statement that it had not received the strike notice.
The strikes were motivated by "worsening labour conditions, a lack of respect for the dignity of the cabin crew ... 
and threats over sales objectives", Gandra said. Ryanair says it has some of the best working conditions in the low-
cost sector.
Talks on formal union recognition and improved conditions are ongoing with pilot unions in seven countries, but only 
British union BALPA has so far signed a recognition agreement.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said last week Easter strikes were possible in Portugal andIreland, though a pan-
European group of Ryanair pilots described the warning of pilot strikes as "alarmist".
Ryanair executives had initially said they would only engage with cabin crew unions after agreement had been 
reached with the pilots.
But on Monday Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson told journalists that he had issued invitations for talks to cabin 
crew unions in Portugal as well as its three largest markets: the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain.  (Reuters)

Ryanair is to close its Glasgow International airport base in November, as it expands its network from Edinburgh for 
the winter 2018-19 season.
The Glasgow base, set up four years ago, has only a single stationed aircraft.
Ryanair is blaming passenger taxes for "severely" hampering development of the low-fare market from the city's 
main airport.
It says the single Glasgow aircraft and five routes – Lisbon, Sofia, Riga, Berlin and Derry – will be transferred to 
Edinburgh.
But the airline stresses that Glasgow International links with Dublin, Krakow and Wroclaw will continue.
Ryanair also has a base at Glasgow Prestwick.
Its winter schedule from Scotland, as a result, will feature 45 routes from Edinburgh – including 11 new services.
These will comprise the five former Glasgow links plus Gothenburg, Hamburg, Stockholm Skavsta, Seville, Tallinn 
and Memmingen.
Ryanair will offer eight routes from Glasgow Prestwick along with the three from Glasgow International.

RYANAIR yesterday rebuffed pressure from pilot group the European Employee Representative Council (EERC) 
calling on the airline's boss Michael O'Leary to resign.
In its letter, the EERC, an unofficial body set up to push for improved conditions last year, said the budget airline 
has failed to stem the large number of pilots leaving the airline.
The group said the number of pilots deserting the carrier had not dropped since rostering troubles last year led the 
airline to cancel a raft of flights and the suspension of a number of routes.
"By our assessment, it looks like further cancellations are inevitable due to the continuing resignations of pilots," 
Reuters reported the letter as saying.
In a statement responding to the EERC letter, Ryanair said: "The EERC, and their letters, have no legal standing or 
validity. Ryanair pilots continue to accept pay increases of 20 per cent (so far accepted by 80 per cent of Ryanair 
pilots) which show that Ryanair pilots do not pay any attention to this so-called EERC either." The airline managed 
to quell the threat of strikes over the festive period, agreeing to recognise unions.

A pilot group that helped spearhead a staff revolt at Ryanair last year has called on Chief Executive Michael 
O'Leary to resign in the latest sign of strains in staff relations at Europe's largest low-cost airline.
The European Employee Representative Council (EERC), an unofficial pan-European body set up by Ryanair pilots 
to mobilize for better conditions last year, said it believed large numbers of pilots were leaving the airline and that 
O'Leary had failed to resolve the problem.
Several pilot unions have said that the EERC represents a significant number of the airline's more than 4,000 pilots, 
but Ryanair management has dismissed it as a front for "competitor pilot unions."
In a letter to O'Leary seen by Reuters, the EERC said that the number of pilots leaving the airline had not 
decreased since a shortage of standby pilots last year led the airline to cancel 20,000 flight and trim its growth 
plans.
"By our assessment, it looks like further cancellations are inevitable due to the continuing resignations of pilots," the 
letter said.
A senior Ryanair executive earlier this month said the airline had more than enough pilots to operate its schedule.
The letter said pilots had noticed in recent weeks an increase in the number of requests to work on days off, 
something pilots say happened in the lead-up to the cancellations.
At the same time, the letter repeated an offer to help convince pilots to work extra hours and it described O'Leary's 
predictions of strike action in the coming weeks as "alarmist."
Ryanair pilot group calls for O'Leary's resignation
O'Leary said last week that he believed strike action was likely during Easter week.
The airline averted widespread strikes ahead of Christmas by announcing plans to recognize pilots' unions for the 
first time in its 32-year history.
But talks with pilot unions to formalize union recognition and improved terms have stalled in recent weeks. While 
Ryanair says talks are ongoing in seven countries, only British union BALPA has signed a recognition agreement.
"We suggest you leave now, and we call on the board and investors to engage a new CEO to return this airline to 
its rightful place," the EERC letter said.
Ryanair said in a statement that the EERC and its communications had "no legal standing or validity."
It said that 80% of Ryanair pilots had already accepted a 20% pay increase that the EERC has opposed on the 
grounds that accepting it could prejudice future talks between management and trade unions. (Reuters)

Ryanair is set to compete directly with EasyJet, Germania and Eurowings with flights from Tegel to Palma de 
Mallorca this summer, after disclosing its first-ever service from the Berlin airport.
The budget carrier says it will operate "peak summer" services on the route between June and August using two 
Boeing 737s it has newly based at the Spanish island airport.
Ryanair has not previously operated from Tegel and revealed in December that it had applied for slots to do so.
In addition, the airline will start Palma services from Dusseldorf – another German airport from which it does not 
currently operate – and also from Nuremberg and Stuttgart this summer.
FlightGlobal schedules data for the period June to August indicates that EasyJet, Eurowings and Germania will 
offer competing flights on the Palma route from Tegel.
EasyJet only began operating the route earlier this year after acquiring slots and other assets from the creditors of 
Air Berlin last year.
EasyJet, Germania and Ryanair all offer services to Palma from another of the German capital's airports, 
Schonefeld – as does TUIfly during the winter season.
Eurowings also flies from Nuremberg, Dusseldorf and Stuttgart to Palma. Germania additionally serves the Spanish 
destination from Nuremberg, while Norwegian and TUIfly operate rival Dusseldorf-Palma services. TUIfly operates 
a Palma route from Stuttgart.
Niki served Palma from Tegel until its filing for insolvency last year.

The carrier, newly relaunched as Laudamotion, is set to resume Palma services from Basel, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt

In addition to its new routes, Ryanair will increase the frequencies of Palma services from Cologne, to 13 per week, 
and Dortmund, to five per week.

With its embracing of open skies, Ecuador has brought about new optimism in an airline industry that is hoping to 
see changes similar to those witnessed in Argentina over the recent year.
A commitment by Ecuador President Lenin Moreno to an open skies agenda, since he came into power May 2017, 
has been the driver of fresh hope.
"The previous governments were very closed," says Peter Cerda, IATA regional vice-president for the Americas, in 
Quito.
"They now have a more business-friendly agenda," he told FlightGlobal, in a recent interview. "Ecuador was a 
sleeping market the last few years."
With a population of 16.3 million, Ecuador is nowhere near the size of large Latin American markets like Brazil, 
Mexico and Colombia. The South American country is also one of the smallest among its peers, with an area size 
that is slightly smaller than the US state of Nevada, according to the Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook.
But what Ecuador lacks in size, it makes up for in geographic location, point out some observers. Tucked between 
Colombia and Peru on South America's west coast and straddling the Equator, Ecuador and its tourism attractions 
could be an appealing destination for airlines.
"There's a perception that Peru is a bigger market," says Viva Air Group chief executive Declan Ryan at Routes 
Americas in Quito recently. "If the numbers of Ecuador are lower, there's no reason why it should be lower."
Viva Air is in negotiations with Ecuador's government to potentially base a third Viva airline in the country after 
VivaColombia and Viva Air Peru. Ryan, who is the son of Ryanair founder Tony Ryan, says he was "blown away"

by Cotopaxi airport in Latacunga. He believes that the airport, which is served by only TAME, could be a viable 
alternative to Quito's main airport.
Quito's main airport is about a 50min journey from central Quito, while Cotopaxi is a 1h 30min drive away. But 
affordable public transportation could make the airport an attractive base for Viva and the price-sensitive customers 
it likes to attract, says Ryan.
"I think there's a real low-cost opportunity in Ecuador if we get the right airport deal," he tells FlightGlobal. "If you 
link Colombia, Peru and Ecuador together, it's probably the golden triangle for backpackers."
Ecuador's transport minister Paul Granda Lopez agrees that there are opportunities for new airlines in Ecuador, but 
was also quick to add during a presentation at Routes Americas that his ministry oversees other modes of 
transportation.
"We have to find an equilibrium point to not damage the market," Lopez says.
Aside from committing to welcome more foreign airlines into Ecuador, Lopez says the ministry wants to lower 
operating costs through lower fuel prices and fees, especially at Ecuador's state-owned airports. Seventeen of the 
country's 21 operational airports are managed by the civil aviation authority, he says.
"We want to improve costs and rates," says Lopez. "We are meeting airlines who want to fly here. Open skies 
would mean greater connectivity for the country."
The government is in talks to update its bilateral air services agreements, says Andrew O'Brian, chief executive of 
Quito International airport. He indicates that Ecuador is close to signing an agreement with Canada, and wants to 
reach an open skies deal with the USA.
"The protectionism is going away," he tells FlightGlobal.
The country's embrace of open skies, which it is extending to all airports except the protected airports on the 
Galapagos Islands, is a reversal from years of protectionist policy that had favoured state-owned carrier TAME.
Ecuador does not have to look far for an example of how a change in government policy can benefit air traffic 
growth. Further south, Argentina has seen a significant uptick in international traffic since President Mauricio 
Macri's government came into power in late 2015, ushering in a new era of openness in foreign airline service.
FlightGlobal schedules data shows that international air traffic to Argentina was mostly growing in the single-digit 
range annually from 2012 to 2015. In 2016 and 2017, the growth rate climbed to around 12%.

IATA's Cerda says his organisation is hoping for a similar change in Ecuador. "Both governments were very 
closed," he says. "Now the government in Ecuador is looking at open skies, and stimulating growth at secondary 
airports like Cuenca."
The efforts are beginning to bear some fruit. Aeromexico will boost frequencies on its route from Mexico City to 
Quito from 13 April, going to 10 times weekly from daily currently. Brazil's Gol has also signed a memorandum of 
understanding with Quito airport to develop nonstop service between São Paulo and the Ecuadorian capital.
O'Brian, a Canadian expatriate who has led the airport for about five years – with most of those under the previous 
administration – says he has witnessed firsthand the changes taking place.
"I've seen what it's like to do business here... it's a new Ecuador."

 A pilot group that helped spearhead a staff revolt at Ryanair (RYAAY) last year has called on Chief Executive 
Michael O'Leary to resign in the latest sign of strains in staff relations at Europe's largest low-cost airline, according 
to media reports. ADRs rose less than 1% intraday.
The European Employee Representative Council, an unofficial pan-European body set up last year by Ryanair 
pilots to mobilize for better conditions, said it believed large numbers of pilots were leaving and that O'Leary had 
failed to resolve the problem, Reuters' said in a report.
Shares traded near the top end of their 52-week price range of $78.35 - $127.35.

British Airways owner International Airlines Group has become the latest European carrier to ramp up expansion 
plans this year, as it looks to take advantage of strong demand.
The group, which also owns Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus, said it would increase capacity 6.7 per cent this year, 
up from 2.6 per cent in 2017, focusing growth on the transatlantic market.
IAG signalled an upbeat outlook for 2018, with plans to raise both its profit and passenger unit revenues as well as 
lowering costs. Yesterday it reported a 19 per cent rise in full-year operating profit before exceptional items to 
(EURO)3.02bn, up from (EURO)2.5bn a year ago.
Shares were down 5.7 per cent at the close in London as concerns rose that airlines were expanding too quickly at 
a time of rising fuel costs. Last week shares in Air France-KLM fell after the carrier said it would boost seating by up 
to 4 per cent this year.
Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG, said he was confident the group would improve its unit revenue in 2018 in spite 
of an increase in capacity. The majority of its growth would be focused on longhaul expansion of its low-cost airline 
Level, as well as Aer Lingus, across the Atlantic. "For us, this is all efficient growth, because we're planning for unit 
revenues to improve through 2018 as well," Mr Walsh said.
Some analysts signalled concern. "IAG's outlook for a positive unit revenue environment in 2018 runs counter to our 
own analysis of the current sector outlook," said Daniel Roeska, aviation analyst at Bernstein.
BA parent's move to bolster capacity rattles investors; Airlines
It follows comments made by Ryanair this month, which warned that it did not share the optimism of rivals over fare 
rises this year. In January, easyJet talked of reduced competitive pressure on prices following a number of airline 
bankruptcies across Europe.
IAG said it would look to grow organically in Austria after its bid to buy insolvent airline Niki was scuppered in 
January by the Austrian airline's founder, Niki Lauda, the former Formula One champion.

Aer Lingus owner IAG expressed confidence about 2018 on Friday and pledged more cash for shareholders but a 
fall in fourth-quarter profit sent its shares lower.
The airline group said it expects to add seats this year to take advantage of strong travel demand while keeping 
costs under control.
But the last three months of the year were worse than expected, and plans to expand capacity by 6.7% came amid 
worries that airlines are growing too quickly and will struggle with costs as rising oil prices boost their jet fuel bills.
IAG shares were down 4.5% at 595 pence at 0955 GMT, which analysts at Goodbody attributed to IAG's worse-
than-expected fourth quarter.
Its quarterly operating profit fell 6%, a decline which IAG put down to changes in employee bonus provisions. Its 
non-fuel unit costs rose 0.5%.
IAG, which also owns British Airways, Iberia, and Vueling said it expected to increase profit and passenger unit 
revenue this year while reducing costs.
"The important thing for us, which I think sets us apart from a lot of our competitors, is we're looking at (capacity) 
growth of 6.7% but with unit revenues improving off the back of that growth," CEO Willie Walsh told reporters.
But some analysts were not convinced.

Shares in rival Air France-KLM fell earlier this month over worries about its ability to reduce costs.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has said he doesn't share rivals' optimism over unit revenue this year.
For the full year, IAG reported a 19% rise in operating profit before exceptional items to 3.02 billion euros and 
announced the return of an extra 500 million euros to shareholders. (Reuters)

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has expressed support for London Stansted airport's application to raise its 
annual cap on passenger numbers by eight million to 43 million.
"Stansted's potential and spare capacity remains untapped," O'Leary states. "So it's vital to make best and efficient 
use of the existing infrastructure to provide more growth opportunities and greater value for consumers at a time 
when runway capacity is more constrained in the southeast of England."
Announcing the submission of its planning application yesterday, Stansted said the extra capacity would "ease 
pressure on the London airport system by unlocking additional capacity at a time when other airports are full".
It adds that the increase in passengers is achievable "within current approved limits on aircraft noise and flight 
numbers" thanks to the "next generation of new, quieter aircraft" such as the Boeing 737 Max jets ordered by 
Ryanair and the Airbus A320neos being taken by EasyJet.
The proposal is based on Stansted continuing to operate a single runway, but would involve "additional airfield 
infrastructure within the current airfield boundary".
Stansted, which is operated by Manchester Airports Group, expects to reach its current passenger cap of 35 million 
by "the early 2020s".
FlightGlobal schedules data for February shows Ryanair is by far the largest operator at the facility, accounting for 
74% flights, or 4,140, over the month. EasyJet is operating 712 flights, while Jet2 and Eurowings are responsible for 
just under 200 services each.

In the latest FlightGlobal airport rankings – based on 2016 data – Stansted was the UK's fourth-busiest airport,

Ryanair expects Easter strike in Ireland or Portugal
Ryanair expects Easter strike in Ireland or Portugal

Ryanair expects staff to strike during Easter week in either Ireland or Portugal, chief executive Michael O'Leary said 
on Wednesday, as talks with some unions over formal recognition and improved conditions falter.
O'Leary earlier this month warned of possible disruption at Easter or the summer but did not specify what markets 
were likely to be hit.
He said at the time the airline would rather see bookings damaged by the uncertainty around a strike than give in to 
"laughable" union demands.
Ryanair averted widespread strikes ahead of Christmas by announcing plans to recognize pilots' unions for the first 
time in its 32-year history.
But talks with pilot unions to formalize union recognition and improved terms have stalled in recent weeks. While 
Ryanair says talks are ongoing in seven countries, only British union BALPA has signed a recognition agreement.
"We expect some adverse publicity ... and some disruptions," O'Leary told a news conference in Lisbon. "We had a 
strike in Germany on Dec. 22... we expect the next one will be in Ireland - or maybe it will be in Portugal - during 
Easter week."
No flights were canceled during the four-hour Dec. 22 strike.
Irish pilot union FORSA/IALPA has not announced plans to strike, but it has said pilots had rejected an offered raise 
and that Ryanair was refusing the union's demand to be recognized as the exclusive body for collective bargaining.
Ryanair expects Easter strike in Ireland or Portugal
Portuguese cabin crew union, SNPVAC, have said they will decide this week when to strike, with a maximum of 
three days in late March and three days in early April, union official Fernando Gandra told Reuters on Wednesday.
The strike was motivated by "worsening labor conditions, a lack of respect for the dignity of the cabin crew ... and 
threats over sales objectives," he said. Ryanair says it offers staff some of the best conditions in the low-cost 
sector.
O'Leary said he was making "significant progress" in talks with Portuguese pilots union SPAC, but that 
management would only open talks with cabin crew after agreement had been reached with pilots.
He said management had offered a pay increase directly to Portuguese pilots, bypassing the union, and that 75 
percent of pilots had accepted the offer.
Ryanair last year flew 130 million passengers from 87 bases across Europe, including four bases in Portugal and 
four in Ireland. It says it operates around 20 percent of Portugal's 28 million annual flights and 48 percent 
of Ireland's 18 million. (Reuters)

Kosice airport braces for hit from Wizz base closure; Kosice airport is 
expecting its traffic figures this year to be hit by Wizz Air's decision to close 
its base there and cut three of its four routes from the Slovakian gateway.

Kosice airport is expecting its traffic figures this year to be hit by Wizz Air's decision to close its base there and cut 
three of its four routes from the Slovakian gateway.
Speaking to FlightGlobal at the Connect conference in Tbilisi on 20 February, the airport's chief executive Michael 
Tmej said the airport faced losing 70,000 passengers as a result of the budget carrier's rethink.
The airport grew passenger numbers 13% last year, to 496,000.
Earlier this month ,Wizz disclosed its intention to end flights from Kosice to German city Cologne, Tel Aviv in Israel 
and the UK's Doncaster Sheffield on 14 May and to withdraw the single Airbus A320 it has based at the Slovakian 
airport. However, a service to London Luton will be retained.
At the time, the airline said the route closures were a result of "changing customer demand". However, Tmej 
asserts that load factor on the route to Doncaster Sheffield averaged more than 90% last year.
He suggests that the decision may have been prompted by Wizz's need to reassign aircraft to its Luton base 
because it must use slots acquired from Monarch or risk losing them.
Tmej believes that the Kosice decision fits a pattern of closing bases at which a single aircraft is stationed, citing 
Lublin in Poland as another example.
"We try to replace now whatever is possible, but it is very late [in the season] now," he says.
The "ideal solution" would involve a carrier stepping in on all the routes, says Tmej, but he considers this scenario 
"unlikely" as only EasyJet or Ryanair could replace all the lost routes.
Kosice airport braces for hit from Wizz base closure Kosice airport is expecting its traffic figures this year to be 
hit by Wizz Air's decision to close its bas....
Efforts are under way to find an airline to replace Wizz's Tel Aviv route, which he says is required by Slovakian tour 
operators that have sold packages to the Israeli destination. About 3,000 passengers per month travel on the route, 
he estimates.
Kosice is keen to continue working with Wizz on its remaining Luton service to show the budget carrier there is "still 
a market" at the Slovakian city, says Tmej.

No wonder Warren Buffett once called the airline industry a "death trap for investors". For decades, cutthroat 
competition left little but fumes for shareholders. But in recent years, passenger numbers grew faster than capacity; 
2018 could be the fourth year in a row when airlines are able to reward their owners.
There are some signs that the boom-to-bust capacity cycle has finally been broken. Consolidation in the US has 
more than quadrupled operating profit margins in the past six years. Even the Sage of Omaha has been persuaded 
to invest.
In Europe, margins have risen even faster but at 6.3 per cent, they are still less than half those achieved in the US. 
In part, that reflects the ferocious competition from no-frills airlines in the short-haul market.
The bankruptcies of Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia have provided some temporary relief. Do not expect it to last. 
Ryanair has already promised a price war in the crucial summer period. Yesterday, Air France, which has cut costs 
and launched its own no-frills brand, underlined the intensifying competition. Promises to "pursue the offensive" and 
results below forecasts sent its shares 6 per cent lower.
Industry association Iata says airlines should more than cover their cost of capital again this year. But higher fuel 
prices will put pressure on margins everywhere, including the fast-growing Asian market. Airlines earn an average 
profit of under $9 for each passenger they carry. That is a relatively low buffer - and one that is still subject to 
turbulence.

Ryanair says cutting fares 30% to fill Catalonia flights
Ryanair says cutting fares 30% to fill Catalonia flights

Ryanair has been cutting fares by up to 30% to fill flights to Barcelona and other cities in Catalonia as 
holidaymakers are nervous of political upheaval in the Spanish region, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on 
Tuesday.
Tourist numbers in Barcelona dipped after an attack in August left 16 people dead and an illegal independence vote 
prompted scenes of police violence and mass protests, but have since rebounded.
Ryanair still plans to increase capacity in Spain as a whole sharply in the coming year, adding 9% more flights in 
the year to March 2019, O'Leary said, compared with an increase of 6% in its network as a whole.
"To fill the aircraft we had to lower the fares (for flights to Barcelona) very significantly," O'Leary told a press 
conference in Madrid. "The fares are significantly lower as we approach the summer than they were last year," he 
said, though demand for travel to Madrid remained strong.
Capacity in Spain has increased in recent years as operators have moved from destinations in the Middle East and 
North Africa in the wake of attacks on tourists.
The number of international tourists visiting Spain broke records for a fifth straight year in 2017, climbing 8.9% year-
on-year to 82 million.
One threat to Ryanair's rapid expansion plans are relations with pilots. While strike threats in December were 
averted by a pledge to recognise labour unions for the first time, the airline has so far only managed to reach a 
recognition agreement with one of the seven unions with which it is in talks.
Ryanair says cutting fares 30% to fill Catalonia flights
O'Leary said Spain's SEPLA pilots' union had not yet responded to offers of a pay rise and terms for union 
recognition and Ryanair was considering bypassing the union and offering the increase directly to pilots - something 
it has done in Ireland.
"With SEPLA we're trying to say: let's have a vote on the Spanish pilots' pay increase, even when we're trying to 
finalise the agreement. If you don't, we'll offer it directly to the Spanish pilots," he said.
SEPLA last week said it would launch a legal action against Ryanair and said it had been naive to think 
management wanted to change "toxic labour relations." (Reuters)

Almost 4.6 million passengers passed through Germany's largest airport near Frankfurt in January, up 7.6 per cent 
on the year, according to figures released by the operating company Fraport on Tuesday.
The figure was a record for the month, the company said, adding that the gaps created in the German market by 
the bankruptcy of Air Berlin had been closed. The budget carrier initiated insolvency proceedings in August.
New routes to European destinations led to an increase in flight movements of 8.6 per cent, with additional routes 
provided by budget carriers Ryanair and Wizz leading the rise.
Among the new offerings were classical holiday destinations around the Mediterranean, including Turkey, where 
there was evident growth for the first time since the start of the financial crisis.
Long-haul routes grew less strongly at 2.6 per cent, although there was a rise in flights to South Korea ahead of the 
Winter Olympics.

In the UK and several of its other big markets, Ryanair is the airline passengers and the media love to hate – thanks 
to its cost-slashing philosophy and aviation establishment-baiting boss. In Rzeszow, locals have a different 
perspective on the Irish budget carrier. For years, Ryanair provided the southern Polish city’s only direct connection 
to Western Europe, with a daily flight to London Stansted. Today, the airline also flies to four other UK airports, plus 
Dublin, making for an easier commute for those working for an increasing number of British companies basing 
themselves in Poland’s main aviation cluster, Aviation Valley.
Aneta Cygan-Rzeminska, project manager with start-up Poeton Polska, is one. She flies “very cheaply” via Bristol to 
meetings at her parent company, a surface treatment specialist based in Gloucester and Cardiff. She can see the 
terminal from her first floor office in a “business incubator” owned by Podkarpackie’s provincial government. The 
Ryanair connection was also crucial to Bristol-based engine components manufacturer McBraida’s decision to set 
up next to the airport in 2013. In addition to Bristol, the airline flies to East Midlands, Glasgow and Manchester as 
well as Mediterranean routes in the summer.
Although the Dublin-based airline is responsible for three-fifths of Rzeszow’s traffic – “Ryanair feeds us,” says 
Michal Tabisz, president of the board of Rzeszow airport – it is not the only carrier offering direct routes out of 
Poland. Lufthansa flies daily to Munich, and there are discussions with the airline to increase that frequency to 
twice-daily, with an early flight making day trips possible for business travellers connecting to other European cities 
through the German hub. Polish flag carrier LOT also offers four daily flights to Warsaw, allowing passengers to 
transfer to its international network.
new terminal
Provincial government-owned Rzeszow’s three-storey, glass-plated terminal replaced its tiny, box-like predecessor 
in 2012 and annual passenger numbers stand at around 700,000. This is only around half its capacity of 1.3 million, 
but “puts us at the top of the second division of Polish airports, behind the top five”, says Tabisz. The airport has a 
No Headline In Original
short-term “strategic target” of 1 million passengers. However, Tabisz adds: “It is not a race. What matters is that 
we are meeting the needs of the region. It’s an airport that can still grow.”
Tabisz identifies freight as a potential growth segment for the airport, which opened a cargo terminal in 2017. With 
one of Poland’s longest runways, Rzeszow can accommodate the largest freighters. “Cargo is what we really want 
to go with,” says Tabisz. “We would love a Chinese company. Our advantage is that we are close to the rest of 
central Europe and we have plenty of room. If you go to Warsaw, you won’t get treated as a priority customer. 
Come here and you will get every benefit going.”
Maintenance, repair and overhaul is another target. The airport, which is 90km (56 miles) from its closest rival, 
Krakow, owns land around the perimeter and two MRO companies – Heli-One and Linetech – have already set up 
operations. The Linetech hangar, owned by the airport, is the largest in Poland. Tabisz would especially like to 
attract a carrier – including Ryanair – to establish a hub at Rzeszow, creating local jobs for crew and line 
maintenance. “We don’t have any airlines based here, but that would really help me,” he says.

Ryanair sets new course with union agreement; Airline vows to protect its 
low-cost model after being forced to recognise pilots' representatives

For the past two decades Ryanair's voluble chief executive Michael O'Leary has been adamant that hell would 
freeze over or he would supposedly cut off his arms before he agreed to sit down with trade unions.
But late last year, faced with growing pressure from pilots and threats of strike action in the run-up to Christmas, 
Europe's biggest low-cost airline shocked investors with a surprise decision to reverse its longstanding policy and 
recognise unions for the first time in Ryanair's 32-year history.
It pushed forward with those plans last month, signing its first union deal with British pilots' group Balpa - a 
significant move as the UK accounts for about a quarter of Ryanair's pilots and aircraft.
"It's a critical junction in the airline's history," says Daniel Roeska, aviation analyst at Bernstein. "Its non-union 
stance was one of the big hallmarks of Ryanair's 'why we are very different' story. The reputational significance 
here is that it's not that different any more. Ryanair still has great airline managers, it's still a great business model 
but ... it's becoming more similar to other airlines."
The change of course comes after a difficult time. A pilot rostering mess-up in September saw it cancel more than 
20,000 flights, slow its growth plans for winter and next summer and go on a hiring spree for cockpit crew.

recognise pilots' representatives following roster....
The fiasco dealt a severe blow to Ryanair, which has built its reputation as an efficient, safe and reliable operator.
It also sparked a battle with pilots, who were emboldened to push for better terms in the wake of the crisis.
Several analysts think its decision to recognise unions is one of the biggest U-turns in Ryanair's history, noting that 
its non-union stance has been key in helping the carrier build itself into the juggernaut it is today with its aggressive 
focus on cutting costs. In Europe, along-side easyJet, it has upended the industry over the past 30 years with a 
singleminded focus on cheap fares, which has seen legacy airlines such as British Airways, Lufthansa and Air 
France-KLM cede as much as 40 per cent of the shorthaul market to their budget rivals. Keeping labour costs low 
has been a core part of Ryanair's successful business model. Its pilots are a mix of fulltime employees and 
independent contractors. Its refusal to recognise unions meant it was able to drive productivity harder than legacy 
flag carriers.
"If they move to a unionised workforce, I would expect that to lead to normal industry working practices with local 
employment contracts and permanent employment contracts," says Andrew Lobbenberg, aviation analyst at HSBC. 
"A key part of Ryanair's success has been how flexible the business has been. And part of that has been their 
contractual ability to move people around, which has come from their employment structure."
Ryanair has spent the past four months attempting to fix problems with its pilots by offering to increase pay by 20 
per cent, but has only agreed deals with just over half of its 87 bases.
Some analysts think Ryanair had to change. "They were in a place where their natural established behaviour, which 
is to respond assertively or aggressively to labour or where people are challenging them, was only going to make 
the situation worse," says Mr Lobbenberg of HSBC. "It would only serve to accelerate the attrition [of pilots] and put 
them into deeper trouble."
Mr Roeska says it is crucial for Ryanair to "safeguard the number of employees they have" in order to keep to flying 
schedules and the 2024 target of carrying 200m passengers a year, up from 130m this year.
"That's why they are so adamant in pushing through the wage rises. It's seldom that an employer is so desperate to 
give people more money," he says.
While there are concerns about the impact of unionisation on Ryanair's business, its management team has been 
quick to deny that it will affect its low-cost, high-productivity model.
Last week, the airline said recognising unions and agreeing new pay deals would cost it (EURO)100m a year from 
2019, which includes any future deals reached with cabin crew unions. It also maintained its full-year profit forecast 
of (EURO)1.4bn-(EURO)1.45bn.
But while Ryanair has done a deal with the British pilots union, and expects to conclude others shortly, it is facing 
more of a battle with some, including those in Ireland, Germany and Spain.
However, Ryanair showed it has not lost its combative streak, with Mr O'Leary warning at its third-quarter results 
the airline could be hit with further strikes as it was facing "laughable demands for legacy-type inefficiencies" from 
some unions across Europe. He added: "We are fully prepared to face down any such disruption."
Eddie Wilson, Ryanair's chief people officer, said the airline had become more "mature" in terms of its approach. 
"We would have fought to have kept the model that we have because it gives you flexibility, but the world has 
moved on," he says. "The business has changed. You have to adapt to it. If you can't win something, then you just 
have to change." But he reiterated that there would be conflict with unions and pilots if they tried to seek anything 
that would "attack" its low-cost, high-productivity model. "If suddenly pilots said they only wanted to fly 400 hours a 
year like elsewhere, then yes, there would be conflict," he says.
For now, it is likely to take months or even years to see the full implication of union recognition on Ryanair's low-
cost business.

Gerald Khoo, aviation analyst at Liberum, says: "Fundamentally they are still in a strong position, with a very 
competitive cost base, high margins and a very strong balance sheet. It's not going to be crippled by this. The 
underlying business model is still absolutely viable and successful."

Highlight: The Ryanair boss has warned that it faces potential disruption to its services in the coming month, but 
has said there will be nothing extra on the table
Body
Ryanair’s chief executive Michael O’Leary has said the airline will not be upping its offer of a 20 per cent pay hike 
for pilots in Dublin.
The Ryanair boss has warned that it faces potential disruption to its services in the coming month, but said there 
will be nothing extra on the table. Pilots across Ryanair are being offered a 20 per cent pay rise as the company 
negotiates directly with unions for the first time. Some of its Dublin-based pilots have held out against the offer and 
the airline has written to them urging them to accept it.
“We have now the crazy situation that the union, instead of securing a 20 per cent pay increase for some of our 
Dublin pilots, we’re having to write to them directly to offer them the right to accept a 20 per cent pay increase in the 
February payroll, having lost out on that increase in January and December,” O’Leary said on a conference call with 
analysts last week.
“Now, I think that’s inevitable that kind of mindless interference by people who are promoting an Aer Lingus agenda 
rather than a Ryanair agenda, it will lead to some disruptions somewhere. So it’s not that I think we are definitely 
going to face strikes, but I want our investors and analysts to be, look, grow up. There is going to be some 
disruptions here.
“The pay increase is 20 per cent. It’s not going to be 21 per cent. It’s not going to be 25 per cent. It’s going to be 20 
per cent, and that’s it.”
Ryanair in December conceded that it would negotiate pay with unions after a months-long stand-off that saw pilots 
across dozens of European bases seek collective bargaining. It is the first time in the company’s history that it sat 
down to discuss pay with representatives of a union. The offer of a 20 per cent pay rise for pilots in key bases came 
after it was forced to cancel thousands of flights to cope with a shortage of pilots.
O’Leary offers pilots 20 per cent pay hike ‘and that’s it’
O’Leary also said that while there was a tightening in the supply of experienced pilots, there was no shortage of 
new recruits.
“We’ve hired over 1,100 pilots in calendar 2017 and expect to do a similar number again this year. The question for 
us is, as some of the flakier competitors who couldn’t make money when oil was under $40 a barrel last year, is, 
how long they survive when oil is at $70 a barrel, and they will lose even more money and are frantically selling off 
what limited assets they have to provide the cash for them to continue to operate.”
Even after the cost of the flight cancellations and the cost of hiring extra staff, Ryanair said it will still be on course 
to generate a profit of of between €1.4 billion and €1.45 billion in the 12 months to the end of March.

EasyJet has pushed ahead with plans to protect its flying rights after Brexit following a shareholder vote in favour of 
legal changes to help ensure the lowcost airline meets EU ownership rules.
The move makes it the latest carrier to make changes in preparation for Britain's departure from the EU as fears 
grow that a turbulent exit could cause disruption across the aviation market.
Airlines are grappling with a range of regulatory puzzles in the wake of Britain's decision to leave the EU.
These include agreeing a new legal basis for British airlines to operate flights between EU countries and ownership 
rules requiring carriers operating in the region to be majority controlled by entities within the bloc.
Yesterday, shareholders at easyJet's annual meeting approved changes to its articles of association that will ensure 
it is EU-owned and controlled after Brexit.
The move means it has the power to force UK shareholders to divest their shares if the airline needs them to.
John Barton, chairman, said: "Brexit is one of the biggest issues facing the European airline industry." He said that 
while the airline had no "immediate intention" of using these powers, they were an "important element in ensuring 
that easyJet plc has the ability to maintain EU ownership and control at all times should we need to do so".
Vote secures easyJet 's right to continue flying after Brexit Airlines
EasyJet said close to 50 per cent of its shares were already held by European Economic Area nationals. It also said 
it expected the Civil Aviation Authority, Britain's aviation regulator, to grant it an air operator's certificate in the 
coming weeks to cover its UK-based aircraft.
It added the government had confirmed the airline, easyJet UK, would be treated as a British carrier after Brexit and 
its parent company was EU-owned.
The airline was one of the first to make moves to protect flying rights following Britain's decision to quit the EU. Last 
year, it set up an EU-based airline to ensure that it could continue intra-European flights regardless of Brexit talks. 
In recent months, other European carriers have taken similar steps.
Ryanair confirmed last month that it had applied for a British air operating certificate to ensure it could continue 
flights in the country after Brexit.

Ryanair 's perception climbs again after winter turbulence
Ryanair's perception climbs again after winter turbulence

RYANAIR has posted a 12 per cent rise in profits after tax in the three months to December. So what has happened 
to the carrier's consumer perception since September when it was beset by flight cancellations and issues 
surrounding pilot holiday? YouGov brand tracking data indicates that following its difficulties in early autumn, the 
airline's impression score (whether someone has a positive impression of the brand) dropped from negative 31 to 
negative 52 among the general public. Since that time, with operations back on track and a spell out of the 
headlines, it has almost recovered, rising by 16 points to negative 36.
The carrier's buzz score (whether someone has heard anything positive or negative about the brand) follows a 
similar trend.
It dropped to negative 45 at its lowest point but has now recovered somewhat, climbing to negative 18.
However, it should be noted that Ryanair remains bottom of the airline sector in terms of both Impression and buzz.
The airline may soon face more adverse press.
The Civil Aviation Authority recently announced a review often top airlines' seating policies to find out whether 
operators deliberately split up groups of passengers travelling together in order to profit from allocated seating. Data 
released this week revealed that those who flew with budget airline Ryanair were the most likely to report being 
separated from their group after deciding not to pay more money to sit with their travel companions.
The good news for Ryanair is that its key selling point remains attractive to its core audience.
Ryanair 's perception climbs again after winter turbulence
While its Value score remains low among the general public (at negative seven), it does far better among its current 
customers (25).
It is a similar story when it comes to the airline's purchase consideration score.
While it currently sits at 20 among the population as a whole, among those who have flown with Ryanair it is a 
much more solid 62.
Ryanair may not win the admiration of all segments but it knows how to play to its target market.

Unions tell Ryanair to start negotiating; Joint le tt er sets out demands for 
uniform pilot pay rises and urges carrier to make "credible" steps towards 
recognition

Relations between Ryanair and European pilot unions appear to have soured after nearly a dozen of them issued a 
set of demands calling on the carrier to change the way it negotiates during pay and recognition talks.
In a joint letter seen by FlightGlobal, issued in late January, 11 pilot unions – including ANPAC in Italy, BALPA of 
the UK, France’s SNPL and Vereinigung Cockpit in Germany – call on the airline to address seven areas in its 
labour relations strategy in order to make its stated intent to recognise trade unions “credible”.
They urge the company to “meet, recognise and negotiate” with all the representative national pilot unions and 
associations that contact them, desist from interfering in the type of pilots chosen to represent the unions in their 
company councils and negotiating teams, and from excluding pilots employed as contractors.
The unions point to the need for agency flightcrew to be involved in the negotiations, and make the case for pilots’ 
freedom to sign contracts governed by the laws in the country where they are based. They also warn the airline 
against attempts to pursue pay deals with conditions attached at individual bases, outside of formal union 
negotiations.
Pan-Europe deals
Where Ryanair wants to unilaterally increase pilot pay, such agreements must in no way constitute a union-
negotiated arrangement and in no way impinge on union-negotiated deals, and pay rises must also be uniform 
across Europe, the unions argue.
Ryanair rebuts the letter’s contents in strong terms, describing the claims as “materially inaccurate”. It denies it is 
seeking to push through a pay-rise offer and accuses unions of showing a “lack of democracy and shameful 
lethargy” by failing to ballot their members on the airline’s offer.
Unions tell Ryanair to start negotiating Joint le tt er sets out demands for uniform pilot pay rises and urges 
carrier to make "credible" steps towards recognit....
To date, the carrier has sought to paint its negotiations with pilots in a positive light, highlighting progress earlier in 
January in concluding pay deals with all of its flightcrew bases in the UK and Ireland except Dublin.
But union recognition talks have been less fruitful. While the carrier on 30 January recognised BALPA, discussions 
with pilot groups in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain have failed to yield agreements.
The airline tells FlightGlobal that some of these negotiations are “progressing well” while others have made “little 
progress”. It attributes this to the “slow or no response from some national unions/company councils”.
So why is Ryanair pursuing this two-tier strategy in its negotiations with pilots, and why has it drawn such 
widespread criticism from unions?
Joe Lappin, a solicitor with UK law firm Stewarts, believes the primary motivation for Ryanair is to conclude pay 
deals with its pilots as quickly as possible in order to prevent them being poached by rival airlines.
“The decision to negotiate pay with Ryanair pilots must be seen in the context of low staff morale stemming from 
the decision by Ryanair to announce in September last year that pilots would be forced to cancel their holiday plans 
to ensure the airline could keep enough planes in the sky in September and October,” he says. “Ryanair pilots have 
been attracted to rival airlines, including Norwegian, who have promised better pay and working conditions.”
Philip von Schoppenthau, secretary-general of the European Cockpit Association, which represents pilots across 
Europe but has no role in the negotiations, makes a similar point.
Von Schoppenthau says the budget carrier was probably sincere in its wish to pay pilots more – a move he 
welcomes – in order to retain its staff, but he feels that the company needs to be more explicit that these talks are 
separate from recognition discussions.
“A lot of Ryanair’s publicity is probably targeted mostly at investors about the pay-rise offer, which it is pushing 
through at its individual bases across Europe asking pilots to take it or leave it,” he says. “This process is taking 
place in parallel with union recognition talks, but Ryanair has presented them in such a way that some may 
perceive that the processes are linked.”
Learning curve
Ryanair is, von Schoppenthau suggests, “still in the process” of getting acquainted with engaging with unions, 
having previously conducted all of its labour relations through employee representative committees.
Attempts to exclude self-employed or agency pilots, or union representatives who work for competitor airlines, 
“could cause a problem”, he warns.
Lappin suggests that, in the UK at least, the practice of excluding agency workers is not necessarily a flawed 
strategy for Ryanair as they, along with self-employed pilots, would not be included within a bargaining unit.
However, he notes that “any terms negotiated by the union on behalf of its members employed by Ryanair” would 
likely flow back to the airline’s self-employed pilot population too.
He notes that many self-employed pilots are likely to be members of BALPA, “and BALPA will make a case on their 
behalf”.
Ryanair still has a strong hand to play in its negotiations with its pilots. As Europe’s largest airline and one that 
consistently posts strong financial results, it appears to offer stability in an industry still coming to terms with the 
collapse of operators such as Air Berlin and Monarch.
But in the aftermath of its pilot rostering crisis last year, the days of Ryanair holding closed-door meetings at each of 
its bases around Europe and setting the tempo for wage negotiations seem very much to be over.

In theory, the Irish airline could use its regular share buybacks to help make sure it is controlled by EU-resident

Third-quarter results yesterday came with the usual predictions of fare wars and a warning of more strikes as

These are nothing new; Ryanair has spent (EURO)3.9bn buying back stock since 2007. But they may come under

A simpler solution is to deem UK-held shares "restricted" and compel holders to sell to an EU investor. Ryanair's

Ryanair expects Brexit worries to hold back fares Airlines ; Budget carrier to add ticket refund clause next year

Ryanair has warned that airlines operating out of the UK will struggle to raise fares for the summer holiday season 
and into 2019, as uncertainty over how Brexit will affect Britons' travel rights makes them cautious about travelling 
abroad.
"We do not share the optimism of competitors and market commentators for summer 2018 fare rises," Ryanair also 
said alongside quarterly results.
"The lack of clarity on Brexit continues to overhang fares and pricing on routes to [and] from the UK. We would, 
even at this early date, urge extreme caution on investor and analyst assumptions for fares [in 2019]."
This followed an upbeat update from rival easyJet last month, which talked of reduced competitive pressure on 
prices following several airline bankruptcies.
Ryanair's shares closed down 2.4 per cent at (EURO)15.74 yesterday, even though the budget airline announced a 
(EURO)750m share buyback and revealed its revenues and traffic grew, despite flight disruption last autumn due to 
problems with pilot rosters.Net profit increased 12 per cent to (EURO)106m for the three months to December 31, 
compared with the same period last year. Its revenues gained 4 per cent to (EURO)1.4bn and passenger numbers 
were up 6 per cent to 28.8m.
Ryanair expects Brexit worries to hold back fares Airlines ; Budget carrier to add ticket refund clause next year 
in case EU talks fail
Ryanair's outspoken chief executive Michael O'Leary has taken a more negative view of the willingness of British 
customers to travel because the post-Brexit status of the Open Skies agreement, which allows EU airlines to fly 
freely in the bloc, remains unresolved.
Ryanair plans to add a Brexit refund clause to its tickets from summer 2019, the airline said last week, as it warned 
customers their flights may not be valid if aviation regulations were not finalised by then.
"We are going to see increasing press on this and so while Ryanair has been encouraging people to book flights 
with confidence, what they are saying today is that they obviously are going to also price tickets in a way that 
encourages them to fly," said Mark Simpson, an analyst at Goodbody in Dublin. Ryanair has also bowed to 
pressure from its cockpit crew to recognise trade unions across the world. But the company warned yesterday that 
allowing unions to represent its pilots was not the end of the story. "As we finalise union discussions along similar 
lines to that agreed in the UK, we expect some localised disruptions and adverse PR so investors should be 
prepared [for this]."
The airline also told investors to expect rising staff and fuel costs: "In certain jurisdictions, unions representing 
competitor airlines will wish to test our commitment to our low cost, high pay/ high productivity model to disrupt our 
operations. We are fully prepared to face down any such disruption if it means defending our cost base."

RYANAIR profits rose at the end of 2017 in spite of rostering chaos which saw swathes of flights cancelled in the 
run-up to Christmas.
CEO Michael O'Leary yesterday said the budget carrier had a "cautious" outlook for the final quarter of its financial 
year, although he upgraded his traffic expectations slightly.
Profit after tax rose by 12 per cent to break through the (EURO)100m (£88m) mark during the three months to the 
end of December. Revenues rose by four per cent to (EURO)1.4bn, while passenger numbers rose by six per cent. 
Unit costs fell by one per cent, although costs excluding fuel rose by three per cent in part because of the 
compensation costs from the cancellation of thousands of flights in September. However, the debacle had the 
paradoxical effect of improving punctuality to above 90 per cent. The lack of clarity on Brexit continues to hang over 
the UK operations, said O'Leary, a prominent critic of the decision to leave.
Looking forward, O'Leary urged "extreme caution" on predictions. He said: "While we have practically zero visibility 
on full-year 2019 fares, and our budget is not yet finalised, we do not share the optimism of competitors and market 
commentators for summer 2018 fare rise."

Ryanair Cautious for Fourth Quarter as CEO Prepared to Face Down Trade Union Disruptions
Ryanair Cautious for Fourth Quarter as CEO Prepared to Face Down Trade 
Union Disruptions

 Low cost air carrier Ryanair (RYAAY, RYA.L) reported early Monday a double-digit growth in profit with a 96% load 
factor as it guided to a cautious fiscal fourth quarter, setting the stage for a showdown with trade unions whose 
growing influence across its European operations is threatening the airline's lower cost model via higher staffing 
costs.  
Total operating revenues at Ryanair rose to 1.41 billion euros ($1.76 billion) in the three months to December 31 
from 1.35 billion euros a year ago as traffic grew 6% to 30.4 million, the carrier said in its earnings statement.  
Ryanair, which noted that the European airline consolidation and bankruptcies are providing more growth 
opportunities in the UK, Italy and Germany in particular, reported a 12% jump in profit after tax to 105.6 million 
euros from 94.7 million euros even as average fares fell 4% to 32 euros per customer. 
But, Ryanair's profit could have been higher had it not been for the rostering debacle last year which led to 
thousands of flight cancellations in September and October and, more importantly, forced the carrier to engage with 
trade unions for the first time in 30 years and pushed up staffing costs higher.  
Even though Ryanair reported unit costs were down 1% in the quarter, its ex-fuel costs rose 3% due to higher 
staffing costs, which the company forecasts will rise by an additional 45 million euros in this financial year as the 
budget carrier rolls out pilot pay increases of up to 20% and raises its crew ratios in response to a tightening market 
for experienced pilots.
Ryanair, whose staff costs accounted for 10% of total revenue in the last financial year, has vowed to "not allow our 
industry leading productivity to decline" as it prepares to engage with trade unions across Europe. 
The carrier is still forecasting a 2% decline in unit costs in the current financial year and has maintained its full-year 
guidance in a range of 1.40-1.45 billion euros. It, however, cautioned that this outlook "depends heavily" on the 
absence of union disruptions, unforeseen security events and close-in Easter bookings. As a result, it has tempered 
Ryanair Cautious for Fourth Quarter as CEO Prepared to Face Down Trade Union Disruptions
the outlook for traffic growth to an increase of 8% to 130 million, from 129 million it had forecast earlier. Full-year 
fares are also seen lower by at least 3%.
"In certain jurisdictions, unions representing competitor airlines will wish to test our commitment to our low cost, 
high pay/high productivity model to disrupt our operations," Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary said in the 
statement. "We are fully prepared to face down any such disruption if it means defending our cost base or our high 
productivity model."
Stating its "cautious" outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2018, Ryanair said it expects some localized disruptions as 
it finalizes trade union discussions along lines to that agreed in the UK, where it has concluded the first recognition 
agreement with British Airline Pilots Association, underscoring the fact that the UK accounts for more than 25% of 
its total pilot count. The carrier has also held preliminary discussions with pilot unions in Ireland, UK, Spain, 
Germany, Italy, Portugal, Belgium and France over salaries. When this process has completed, Ryanair expects to 
have similar engagement with cabin crew unions.

 European equity benchmarks were sharply lower on Monday morning amid a global stock selloff, mixed earnings 
results and a disappointing set of economic data on the UK's service sector. 
Activity growth softened in Britain's services sector in January amid subdued inflows of new work, according to 
survey data compiled by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply. January's data pointed 
to a slowdown in growth of services activity across the UK, which stemmed from relatively weak gains in new work. 
Job creation nonetheless picked up as companies retained positive expectations surrounding the outlook. 
Across the globe, Asian equity gauges finished the day mainly lower with the exception of China's Shanghai 
Composite Index, which finished higher, after US stocks ended last week deep in the red.
In equities, Scottish Mutual Investment Trust (SMT.L) was leading the decliners on London's FTSE 100 Index, 
down by 3.3%, followed by Ryanair (RYA.L), down by 3.2% after posting a jump in revenue in its third quarter while 
advising that investors should be prepared for some "localized disruptions" as it finalizes discussions with unions. 
Old Mutual (OML.L), a financial services provider, was 2.7% lower and equipment rental company Ashtead Group 
(AHT.L) was down by 2.5%. Just Eat (JE.L), which operates a food delivery platform, was also 2.5% lower. 
On Frankfurt's DAX, entertainment company ProSiebenSat1 Media (PSM.DE) was 1.9% lower, followed by Henkel 
vz (HEN.DE), a chemical and consumer goods company, down by 1.3% and car-maker Volkswagen (VOW.DE), 
1.2% lower and skincare company Beiersdorf (BEI.DE), down by 1.1%. 
And, on Paris' CAC-40, Airbus (AIR.PA), a manufacturer of aircraft parts, was 2.2% lower, LafargeHolcim 
(LHN.PA), a construction materials company, was down by 1.9% and Bouygues (EN.PA), a diversified industrial 
group, was 1.7% lower. Car-maker Renault (REN.PA) was 1.6% lower. 
The pan-European Stoxx 600 Index was 0.96% lower, London's FTSE 100 Index was down by 1.09%, Frankfurt's 
DAX was 0.46% lower and Paris' CAC-40 was down by 0.78% at the time of writing.

 The European markets ended the first trading day of the new week firmly in negative territory. The loss extended 
the recent losing streak across the pond to six straight sessions.
Global equity markets were under pressure after Friday's strong US employment report cemented the belief among 
investors that the Federal Reserve will likely hike interest rates again in March. This has raised concerns among 
investors about rising inflation.
Investor sentiment also took a hit after coalition negotiations between German Chancellor Angela Merkel's 
conservative party and the Social Democrats broke down over the weekend.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index weakened by 1.56%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip 
stocks decreased 1.27%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major UK companies, lost 1.58%.

In Paris, global consulting and IT service firm Capgemini lost 1.95% after announcing the acquisition of LiquidHub.
In London, Ryanair dropped 1.89% as the budget carrier warned of some localized disruptions and adverse PR in 
the months ahead.
Randgold Resources sank 7.38% after its fourth quarter profit fell from a year ago.
Lloyds Banking Group PLC slid 0.99% after it reportedly banned credit card customers from buying Bitcoin.
Engineering group Sandvik finished lower by 1.90% in Stockholm after its fourth-quarter core profit topped 
forecasts.
European Markets Weaken Further On Inflation Concerns
Leonardo tumbled 4.56% in Milan after UBS downgraded its rating on the stock to "Neutral" from "Buy."
The euro area economy expanded at the fastest pace since mid-2006 in January, final data from IHS Markit 
showed Monday. The final composite output index rose more than initially estimated to 58.8 in January from 58.1 in 
December. The flash score was 58.6.

investor sentiment index fell unexpectedly to 31.9 from 32.9 in January. The score was forecast to rise to 34.5.
Eurozone retail sales declined in December after recovering a month ago, Eurostat reported Monday. The volume 
of retail trade dropped 1.1% month-on-month in December, in contrast to the 2% rise posted in November. Sales 
were forecast to drop 1%.
British service sector activity expanded at a slower pace in January, largely reflecting weak gains in new work as 
Brexit remains the main course of concern, survey data from IHS Markit showed Monday.
The IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply Purchasing Managers' Index, dropped more-than-
expected to 53.0 in January from 54.2 in December. The expected reading was 54.0.
China's private sector activity expanded at the fastest pace in seven years in January driven by accelerated rates of 
activity growth across both manufacturing and services.

Markit showed Monday.

 The following is a summary of top news stories Monday.----------COMPANIES----------Randgold Resources said 
sales and profit grew in the fourth quarter, resulting in a strong year, but noted that a "draconian" mining code is 
being considered by the Democratic Republic of Congo. The gold miner said total revenue for the quarter grew by 
10% to USD328.6 million and for the year by 6.6% to USD1.28 billion. Group production grew by 9.8% in the fourth 
quarter to December 31 to 340,958 ounces and by 5% for the year to 1.3 million ounces, exceeding annual 
guidance. The company said pretax profit increased by 18% for the fourth quarter to USD114.3 million, from 
USD96.8 million in the third quarter, and by 19% for the year to USD480.9 million, from USD402.6 million in 2016. 
However, Randgold warned it is currently engaging at the highest level with the government of Congo to head off 
the enactment of a new mining code, which it believes will severely limit the growth of the mining industry in the 
country. 
The new code was passed last week by both houses of Congo's parliament, but still has to be signed into law by 
the president.----------FTSE 100 grocer Tesco said that following the completion of its acquisition of wholesaler 
Booker Group, Charles Wilson will be appointed chief executive officer of Tesco in the UK and Republic of Ireland, 
with effect on March 5. He will replace Matt Davies, who will leave the company at the end of April after two and a 
half years in the role. Wilson is currently the CEO of Booker, which he has been for 13 years since 2005. Prior to 
that he was executive director at retailer Marks & Spencer for four year from 2001 to 2005. In addition, Tesco said 
its trading has been in line with management expectations since the third quarter of its financial year, and 
anticipates operating profit for the year ending February 24 to be at least GBP1.58 billion, up from GBP1.28 billion 
the year before. The retailer also declared a final dividend for the year of 2.0 pence per share.----------Ryanair 
Holdings kept a cautious outlook for its full financial year 2018 despite reporting growth in profit and revenue for the 
third quarter. The budget airline said it still expects full-year profit in the range of EUR1.40 billion to EUR1.45 billion, 
but said this guidance depends heavily on several events not taking place, including the absence of union 
disruption, unforeseen security events, and close-in Easter bookings. Ryanair added it remained concerned about 
the continued uncertainty surrounding the terms of Brexit, with the risk of serious disruption to UK to EU flights from 
April 2019 unless some arrangement is agreed to before September. For the third quarter to the end of December, 
Ryanair reported growth in customers carried at 30.4 million, up 6.0% from the same quarter the year before.---------
-The owner of British Airways is calling for an end to Heathrow's "monopoly" on the airport's terminals, saying 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: UK Service Sector Growth Weakest In 16 Months
competition between third operators would lower costs for passengers. International Consolidated Airlines Group 
was responding to a consultation related to Heathrow's expansion, saying the development provides "a great 
opportunity" for independent firms to design, build and run commercial facilities at the airport, including terminals. 
IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh said: "Heathrow's had it too good for too long and the government must confirm 
the CAA's (Civil Aviation Authority) powers to introduce this type of competition. This would cut costs, diversify 
funding and ensure developments are completed on time, leading to a win-win for customers."----------
Electrocomponents said it experienced "strong" underlying revenue growth in the start of its second half, with all 
regions experiencing double-digit growth as it continues to look for cost savings. Underlying revenue for the four 
months ended January grew 14%. This was helped by 22% growth from its Asia Pacific region with the Americas 
and Europe growing 12% and 13% respectively. The FTSE 250-listed firm explained the market backdrop remains 
"positive" and it continues to execute well with its improvements. For the year ending March 2018, 
Electrocomponents expects to deliver "stable" gross margins. In the year prior, gross margins stood at 43.4%. -------
---Wizz Air said it saw significant growth in passenger numbers in January, though load factor declined slightly. 
Passengers were up 24% year-on-year to 2.3 million, from 2.1 million in January 2017, while capacity rose 25% to 
2.7 million seats. However, load factor fell 0.3 percentage points in January to 87.7% from 88.0% a year earlier. For 
the rolling 12 months to the end of January, passengers rose 24% to 28.7 million, while load factor improved by 1.9 
percentage points to 91.3% from 89.4%. Capacity in the period rose 22% to 31.5 million seats. Available seat 
kilometres rose 24% in January to 4.2 million, up 23% on a 12 month rolling basis, while revenue passenger 
kilometres rose 24% to 3.7 million in January and was up 26% on a rolling 12 month basis.----------MARKETS---------
-London shares were in the red amid a global sell-off, following sharp declines in the US on Friday. The pound was 
lower against the dollar after data showed UK services PMI failed to meet expectations. Wall Street was pointed to 
a lower open. ----------FTSE 100: down 1.1% at 7,360.52FTSE 250: down 1.3% at 19,706.15AIM ALL-SHARE:

Ryanair says it will face down 'laughable' pilot demands
Ryanair says it will face down 'laughable' pilot demands

Ryanair on Monday warned it would face down what it said were "laughable demands" by pilots for conditions 
typical of high-cost rivals even if that meant strike disruption as Europe's largest budget carrier reported an increase 
in profits.
The Irish airline also warned that its competitors were being overly optimistic in their expectations for fare rises on 
European short-haul routes next summer and urged analysts to maintain "extreme caution" on fare forecasts.
Profits at the Irish airline increased by 12% in the three months to the end of December on an annual basis despite 
a turbulent period in which it had to deal with mass cancellations and the threat of strike action by pilots.
It said it would return 750 million euros to shareholders via a share buyback.
Ryanair averted the threat of widespread Christmas strikes by unilaterally recognising unions for the first time in its 
32-year history, but it has struggled to formalise relations with unions since then and said it expected further threats 
during Easter.
Buoyed by strong financial results and formal agreement on recognition with its British pilots, Chief Executive 
Michael O'Leary said it was preparing to face down other pilot unions even if that meant localised disruption.
"We have some jurisdictions where we are getting ... laughable demands for legacy-type inefficiencies," O'Leary 
said referring to the pay and working conditions typical of the higher cost carriers Ryanair has undermined in recent 
decades with its ultra-low-cost model.
Ryanair says it will face down 'laughable' pilot demands
Pilots say they only want the same conditions to those at low-cost rivals such as easyJet and Norwegian Air 
Shuttle, and some say they will refuse the pay rise unless they get assurances it won't impact future pay talks.
Some pilots have complained of a toxic working atmosphere at the airline and a lack of trust between staff and 
management.
"Frankly we will never agree to those ... if we have to take strikes or disruptions in those jurisdictions, then we will 
take those," he said in a pre-recorded presentation to investors.
Profit after tax for the quarter was 106 million euros, up 12% from a year ago and slightly ahead of a consensus 
forecast of 101 million euros in a Ryanair poll of analysts. Revenues for optional extras such as pre-booked seats 
and extra bags beat expectations, while the airline increased its passenger forecast for the year to end-March to 
130 million from 129 million.
Ryanair reiterated it expected to make a profit after tax of between 1.4 billion and 1.45 billion euros in its financial 
year, which ends on March 31, 2018, a forecast that remains unchanged since a wave of cancellations announced 
in September sparked the recent turmoil. (Reuters)

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Shares of Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) were losing around 3 percent in the 
morning trading in London after the Irish no-frills airline on Monday issued cautious outlook for the remainder of 
fiscal year 2018, despite higher profit and revenues in its third quarter.  'As we finalise union discussions along 
similar lines to that agreed in the UK, we expect some localised disruptions and adverse PR so investors should be 
prepared for same. It is fully prepared to face down any such disruption if it means defending cost base or high 
productivity model,' the company said in its statement.  Looking ahead, for fiscal 2018, the company now expects 
full year traffic to grow 8% to 130 million from previously expected 129 million. 
It expects full-year fares will fall by at least 3%. Ancillary spend per customer should rise by 2%.  While oil prices 
have risen in the second-half of the year, the company stills expects fiscal year 2018 unit costs to be down 2%. 
Accordingly, It maintained its full year guidance in a range of 1.40 billion euros to 1.45 billion euros. This guidance 
depends heavily on the absence of union disruptions, unforeseen security events and close-in Easter bookings, the 
company noted.  Further ahead, the company said it practically has zero visibility on FY19 fares, and its budget is 
not yet finalised, and do not share the optimism of competitors and market commentators for summer 2018 fare 
rises. The company said traffic will grow by 6% in FY19 to 138 million but very early indications are that summer 
2018 fares will remain under pressure.  'Costs will rise next year as our fuel bill increases by over \xA4300m and a 
further \xA4100m is added to staff costs (as up to 20% pilot pay increases annualise). The lack of clarity on Brexit 
continues to overhang fares and pricing on routes to/from the UK. We would, even at this early date, urge extreme 
caution on investor & analyst assumptions for fares in FY19,' the company added.  Ryanair noted that it will provide 
a more detailed fiscal year 2019 guidance during full-year results and investor roadshow in May 2018.  Further, 
Ryanair Board has approved a 750 million euros share buyback of ordinary shares which will start in February and, 
subject to market conditions, should be completed by the end of October. This latest buyback will increase the 
funds returned to shareholders since 2008 to over 6 billion euros.  For the third quarter, profit grew 12% to 105.6 
million euros from 94.7 million euros last year. Earnings per share grew to 8.85 euros cents from 7.55 euros cents 
in the previous year.   Total operating revenues from continuing operations grew 4 percent to 1.41 billion euros from 
1.35 billion euros last year.  Scheduled revenues for the third-quarter were up by 1% to 964.2 million euros due to 
6% traffic growth. This was offset by a 4% drop in average fare to 31.72 euros. Ancillary revenues increased by 
Ryanair Q3 Profit Rises, Warns On Outlook For Rest Of Year; Stock Dips
12% to 440.7 million euros due to 6% traffic growth and higher uptake of reserved seating, priority boarding and car 
hire offset by lower travel insurance and hotel penetration.  The airline carried 30.4 million customers, up 6 percent 
from 28.8 million customers a year ago.  Average fares fell 4% to just 32 euros per customer. Traffic grew 6% to 
30.4 million with load factors up 1% to 96%. Unit costs fell 1%, while ex-fuel unit costs rose 3%.  In London,  
Ryanair shares were trading at 15.58 euros, down 3.29 percent.

Ryanair Q3 Profit Up 12%; Says Outlook For Remainder Of FY18 Cautious

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) reported a 12% rise in third-
quarter profit to 105.6 million euros compared to 94.7 million euros last year, as average fares fell 4% to just 32 
euros per customer. Earnings per share grew to 8.85 euros cents from 7.55 euros cents in the previous year. Traffic 
grew 6% to 30.4 million with load factors up 1% to 96%. Unit costs fell 1%, while ex-fuel unit costs rose 3%.  The 
Board has approved a 750 million euros share buyback of ordinary shares which will start in February and, subject 
to market conditions, should be completed by the end of October. This latest buyback will increase the funds 
returned to shareholders since 2008 to over 6 billion euros. 
 Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said, '.... After 30 years of successfully dealing directly with our people it became 
clear in Dec. that a majority of pilots wanted to be represented by unions. ....While union recognition may add some 
complexity to our business and may cause short-term disruptions and negative PR it will not alter our cost 
leadership in European aviation, or change our plan to grow to 200m traffic p.a. by Mar. 2024. Our aircraft 
allocations may alter by base as we capitalise on new growth opportunities in France and Scandinavia.'  Scheduled 
revenues for the third-quarter were up by 1% to 964.2 million euros due to 6% traffic growth offset by a 4% drop in 
average fare to 31.72 euros. Ancillary revenues increased by 12% to 440.7 million euros due to 6% traffic growth 
and higher uptake of reserved seating, priority boarding and car hire offset by lower travel insurance and hotel 
penetration.   Total operating revenues from continuing operations grew 4 percent to 1.40 billion euros from 1.35 
billion euros last year.  The company said its outlook for the remainder of fiscal year 20118 is cautious. As we 
finalise union discussions along similar lines to that agreed in the UK, we expect some localised disruptions and 
adverse PR so investors should be prepared for same. It is fully prepared to face down any such disruption if it 
means defending cost base or high productivity model.  The company now expects full year traffic to grow 8% to 
130 million from 129 million previously guided. It expects fiscal year2018 fares will fall by at least 3%. Ancillary 
spend per customer should rise by 2%. Unit costs were adversely impacted by 25 million euros non-recurring 
EU261 costs in the second-quarter, and 45 million euros additional staff costs in the second-half.  While oil prices 
have risen in the second-half of the year, the company stills expects fiscal year 2018 unit costs to be down 2%. 
Accordingly, It maintained its full year guidance in a range of 1.40 billion euros to 1.45 billion euros. This guidance 
depends heavily on the absence of union disruptions, unforeseen security events and close-in Easter bookings.  
Ryanair Q3 Profit Up 12%; Says Outlook For Remainder Of FY18 Cautious
The company said, 'While we have practically zero visibility on FY19 fares, and our budget is not yet finalised, we 
do not share the optimism of competitors and market commentators for summer 2018 fare rises. Our traffic will 
grow by 6% in FY19 to 138m but very early indications are that summer 2018 fares will remain under pressure.'  
'Costs will rise next year as our fuel bill increases by over \xA4300m and a further \xA4100m is added to staff costs 
(as up to 20% pilot pay increases annualise). The lack of clarity on Brexit continues to overhang fares and pricing 
on routes to/from the UK. We would, even at this early date, urge extreme caution on investor & analyst 
assumptions for fares in FY19,' the company said.   The company noted that it will provide a more detailed fiscal 
year 2019 guidance during full-year results and investor roadshow in May 2018.

Ryanair to shrug off rostering turbulence

IRISH airline Ryanair looks set to battle through turbulence from its recent rostering troubles when it reveals third-
quarter results today.
Consensus among analysts is for net income for the three months to the end of December to come in at around 
(EURO)101m (£89m), while Goodbody said it is calling profit after tax to be up by a fifth at (EURO)114m.
Last year, Ryanair cancelled a raft of flights in September when it faced pilot rostering troubles. A number of routes 
were then suspended.
Earlier this month, it lost its title as Europe's biggest airline by passenger numbers after the pilot issues, with 
German rival Lufthansa sneaking ahead as it also acquired a chunk of collapsed airline Air Berlin.
Ryanair has remained bullish, saying its rival's charge was "expected given that Lufthansa is growing by acquisition 
whereas Ryanair continues to grow organically".
The airline said it expects to overtake Lufthansa again "unless they acquire some other airline to boost their 
figures".

Ryanair asks Irish pilots to bypass union and accept pay increase
Ryanair asks Irish pilots to bypass union and accept pay increase
Business World (Digest)

Ryanair has asked pilots in its home base in Dublin to bypass their trade union and directly accept a pay rise - even 
as it holds talks with unions across Europe to formalise its shock decision to recognise them.
Europe's biggest budget airline was forced last year to recognise unions for the first time in its 32-year history in 
order to avoid a Christmas strike, after it had to cancel 20,000 flights earlier in the year due to a shortage of standby 
pilots.
It made a breakthrough earlier this week when it secured a formal recognition agreement with British union BALPA, 
but unions in other countries, including Ireland, have said they are not happy with how the negotiations are 
proceeding.
Now, in the latest sign of discord, the airline has accused Irish union FORSA/IALPA of misleading pilots.
Ryanair says that the 65 percent of pilots in Dublin not represented by a union have accepted the pay increase, but 
that the 35 percent represented by FORSA/IALPA were refusing to do so.
"Ryanair has written to this 35 percent to allow them to individually accept these pay increases in February ... due 
to IALPA's refusal to hold a vote that they know they will lose," Ryanair said in a statement.
"We will not stand idly by while they (FORSA/IALPA) delay and mislead our Dublin pilots," the statement said.
In a letter to pilots making the offer, Ryanair management said that FORSA/IALPA had not responded since it sent 
a formal recognition agreement on Jan. 3. The union denies this, saying it has sent letters to management on three 
occasions since then.
Ryanair asks Irish pilots to bypass union and accept pay increase
In a letter sent on Wednesday seen by Reuters, FORSA/IALPA told Ryanair that pilots at meetings had 
unanimously agreed to reject Ryanair's pay offer unless Ryanair confirmed that the acceptance would not prejudice 
future pay talks.
The pilots are also demanding that Ryanair agree that FORSA/IALPA be recognised as the exclusive body for 
collective bargaining with Ryanair pilots based in Ireland and that the airline's system of agreements with individual 
bases be terminated, the letter said.
Unions from across Europe last week sent a letter to Ryanair demanding a joint meeting with management, a 
demand the airline has refused. (Reuters)

Labour issues won't impact Ryanair 's business model: analysts
Labour issues won't impact Ryanair's business model: analysts
AirFinance Journal
February 2018

Ryanair’s ongoing pilot strikes and labour issues will not change the fundamentals of its low-fare business model, 
although they couldmake the economics of the airline less attractive for investors, airline industry analysts have 
said.
“This concept that there is a structural shift in the industry between Ryanair and the competition is just a misleading 
view,” says Goodbody Stockbrokers analyst Mark Simpson in a phone interview.
“If you look at where the cost differentials stand, let's say between itself and Easyjet, the difference given the view 
of an increased cost on labour would narrow that from a &euro;4 differential in labour costs to, let's say, a just-
under-&euro;3 differential, but the total unit cost differential is &euro;24.”
He adds that Ryanair’s labour cost is only a small component of the cost advantage it has over other LCCs.
“So yes, you'll see a difference in that because, obviously, there is an inflation event occurring on their labour costs. 
On the other hand, it's far more significant what they will do to drive change benefits themselves. So the new 
aircraft, new airport deals – these are all things that will continue to keep that gap at a significant level.”
On 15 September 2017, thousands of Ryanair flights were cancelled in Europe because of a mistake dealing with 
pilot holidays. The airline’s pilot WhatsApp and Facebook groups erupted with discontent. On 15 December, chief 
executive officer Michael O’Leary recognised the unions for the first time, after refusing to acknowledge the 
presence of the unions in a general meeting in Dublin earlier that year.
On 18 January, Ryanair confirmed that all 15 of its UK pilot bases – including London Stansted’s which had 
previously rejected an improved pay deal – had voted in secret ballot to accept pay increases of up to 20% and 
these increases would be paid at the January payroll. These increases bring Ryanair’s pilot pay in the UK to 20% 
more than competitor 737 operators, such as Norwegian and Jet2.com."
Ryanair will receive its first Boeing 737 Max 200 in April 2019 (at the start of its fiscal year 2020) from an order of up 
to 210 aircraft which deliver over a five-year period to fiscal year 2024.
Simpson does not see there being any structural change to low cost carriers because of the unionisation issues.
Labour issues won't impact Ryanair 's business model: analysts
Daniel Roeska, analyst at Bernstein, adds: “They’re doing a lot to get their pilots happy again. Yes, it will have an 
impact on cost. Of course, the 20% pay rise has an impact, but I would argue that more local labour law stipulations 
crawl into their contracts, be it on the pilot or the cabin side. We'll see a little bit higher cost inflation on the labour 
side.
“However, in terms of the business model, it really doesn't change that much, because we are talking about five, or 
six-seven euros per seat of a difference, which still doesn't get them anywhere close to Easyjet or Norwegian.”
He says that although the airline’s profitability will likely decrease, the labour issues will not impact the carrier’s 
business fundamentals.
Neil Sorahan told Bloomberg on 5 February that he expects recognising the unions to cost the airline &euro;100 
million a year from 2019. Simpson believes this number may end up being higher than &euro;100 million.
Hesays: “That number captures pay review, which would also encompass cabin crew, as well as the pilots, but over 
the next couple of years there will be other terms and conditions and discussions which may add additional cost.
“Over the next three years, we could see &euro;50 million to &euro;70 million of additional costs being incurred. 
That's thinking about levels of productivity between themselves and some of the other airlines.
“If you benchmarked Easyjet’s number of sectors flown by pilots and cabin crew, to bring its numbers and Ryanair’s 
into equilibrium, Ryanair would have to have an additional 330 pilots over their growth and an additional 850 cabin 
crew over their growth. So that would equate in a full year to something in the order of &euro;73 million.”

RYANAIR confirmed yesterday that a Brexit clause will be included in tickets that go on sale this September for 
2019, as airlines wait for clarity over arrangements for when Britain leaves the EU.
The airline provided detail on the change, saying tickets for its 2019 summer schedule will include a mention noting 
the flights are "subject to the regulatory environment allowing this flight to take place", as it awaits further clarity on 
Brexit progress.
The industry wants clarity over what the arrangements will be when Britain leaves the bloc when it comes to the 
Open Skies Agreement.
Ryanair's chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, said that "nothing has changed" from the airline's perspective, with 
Britain still leaving the EU in 2019.
The airline said bookings were remaining robust at present.
"British people are always going to travel to Europe, Europeans are always going to travel to Britain so it hasn't 
changed where Brits are booking for their summer holidays this year, and we would hope and we would expect a 
solution will be found so that travel will carry on as travel has," Jacobs said.
The airline provided the update along with a plan to ditch all plastic in its operations by 2023, and a pledge to tackle 
compensation claims more quickly - in 10 days.

cups, wooden cutlery and paper packaging.The company unveiled the plan in an attempt to tackle plastic waste 
after fears over its effect on the environment have grown dramatically. The International Air Transport Association 
(IATA) recently revealed that airline passengers were responsible for throwing away over 5 million tonnes of waste 
in 2016, a number that was predicted to double in the 15 years if no action is taken.Chief marketing officer, Kenny 
Jacobs, said Ryanair's environmental plan 'includes our commitment to eliminate all non-recyclable plastics from 
our operations over the next five years'.He claimed that customers will be able to bring their own cups on board, 
adding: "It's not just inflight food and drink. We're looking at the plastic parts within the aircraft and what's non-
recyclable and how do we work with the original equipment manufacturers to move to more recyclable plastics 
within the aircraft and the operation."However, Jacobs admitted that the war on plastics is yet to be won: "There will 
always be some kind of plastics How far we get in terms of the 100% removal of non-recyclable plastics we will see 
over the coming five years."He also said that Ryanair is already is the greenest airline since 96% of its seats are 
now filled on its fuel-efficient fleet of 737s meaning it has a low rate of carbon emissions per passenger.Yet despite 
its noble intentions, the move has sparked some controversies, which are mainly linked with Ryanair's CEO Michael 
O'Leary, who previously hit out at environmentalists and called them 'luddites marching us back to the 18th 
century'.In typical headline-grabbing style, O'Leary also suggested shooting at environmentalists and repeatedly 
denied that climate change is driven by carbon emissions, for which aviation is largely responsible. 
The latest announcement has left commentators wondering whether he had a change of heart or simply enjoys 
contradicting himself.

A shuttle bus transporting travellers from their plane to a terminal at Frankfurt Airport in south-western Germany 
collided with a hauler on Thursday, leaving more than a dozen people injured.
The driver of the hauling vehicle and 13 flight passengers were injured in the crash, with one passenger brought to 
the hospital, police said.
It was unclear how the accident at Germany's largest airport happened, though an initial investigation suggested 
that the hauler ignored the bus' right of way.
The shuttle bus' 72 travellers had arrived on a Ryanair flight from Seville in southern Spain, according to airport 
operator Fraport.
The cost of the collision damages could not immediately be assessed, according to police.

each.
The &euro;750 million ($930 million) programme starts on 6 February 2018 and, subject to market conditions, ends 
not later than 9 November 2018.
The Irish carrier says the purpose of the buy-back programme is to reduce the share capital of the

returned to shareholders since 2008 to over &euro;6 billion.

million.
In fiscal year 2017 the company bought back 72.3 million shares at a total cost of approximately &euro;1.18 billion.

Ryanair to put Brexit clause into ticket sales for summer 2019
Ryanair to put Brexit clause into ticket sales for summer 2019

Irish budget airline Ryanair will put a "Brexit clause" into ticket sales for summer 2019, warning customers that their 
tickets will not be valid if the issue of aviation regulation after Britain's departure from the EU remains unresolved.
Flying rights to, from and within the European Union, as well as between the United States and Britain, are currently 
covered by EU-wide "Open Skies" agreements, but this arrangement is jeopardized by Brexit.
There is no fallback option for aviation if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, and Ryanair's chief marketing officer 
said on Wednesday that airlines had no clarity how aviation will be regulated after Britain's scheduled departure at 
the end of March 2019.
"We'll announce our (2019) summer schedule soon enough... and there'll be a term and condition that this is 
subject to the regulatory environment allowing this flight to take place," Kenny Jacobs told reporters, adding that the 
tickets would go on sale in September.
Customers will be refunded if the clause is exercised.
"We don't see a regulatory solution yet... If in the meantime between now and September, there's a regulatory 
solution found, then those tickets will be sold as normal."
Airlines have said they need a new bilateral deal between Britain and Europe by September or October to replace 
the EU’s "Open Skies" regime, which allows EU airlines to fly wherever they wish within the bloc, to be able to 
provide scheduled flights in the months after Britain leaves the EU.
Ryanair to put Brexit clause into ticket sales for summer 2019
Britain could also be excluded from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) after it quits the EU. British 
government ministers have said they expect to remain included in both Open Skies and EASA.
Airlines are beginning to draw up contigency plans for Brexit, with leading industry body IATA saying that a clear 
view of Brexit is needed by October at the latest.
Ryanair has applied for a British operating license to protect its small domestic UK service, and last October, 
Thomas Cook inserted a similar clause to the one proposed by Ryanair into its ticket sales for April 2019.
Jacobs said it was likely that the clauses would not need to be exercised and a worst-case scenario, where flights 
between Britain and the European Union were grounded, would be avoided, as authorities look to buy more time 
under current rules.
The EU and Britain are both seeking a transition deal to help businesses adapt to Brexit, where Britain will follow 
EU regulations for at least 21 months after it departs.
"There's clearly going to be an extension to Brexit," he said, adding current rules would likely continue beyond 
March next year.
"They are going to find a solution to Open Skies, but it will take a bit longer." (Reuters)

Ryanair has reached its first union deal in its 33-year history, agreeing to recognise Britain's pilot group as it 
attempts to resolve a long-running battle with cockpit crews over wages and conditions.
Europe's biggest budget airline said yesterday that it had signed an agreement with the British Airline Pilots' 
Association (Balpa) that will see the union represent about 600 UK pilots directly employed by Ryanair.
The move represents progress in the low-cost airline's bid to repair relations with pilots following threats of strike 
action last year. In December, Ryanair reversed its long-held policy on not allowing trade unions into the workforce 
in an attempt to avoid disruption during the week of Christmas.
The UK accounts for about a quarter of Ryanair's pilots and aircraft and the deal comes less than two weeks after 
the low-cost carrier's 15 UK bases accepted a pay rise of 20 per cent.
While Ryanair has made progress with its UK pilots, discussions with pilot groups in other countries, such as 
Ireland, are ongoing. As well as joining European unions, some pilots have been pushing for an independent 
European employee council to represent their views to management.
Eddie Wilson, chief people officer at Ryanair, said the agreement showed "how serious Ryanair is about working 
constructively with unions that are willing to work constructively with us".
Ryanair signs deal with British pilots' union Airlines ; Move marks progress in carrier's attempts to end pay and 
conditions battle
He called on other unions to "stop wasting time and act quickly". Ryanair is in talks with unions in Ireland, Italy, 
Germany and Spain.
The Irish airline's dispute with pilots blew up after the carrier had to cancel thousands of flights in September 
because of a rostering failure that led to a shortage of air crew. Pilots were emboldened to push for better terms in 
the wake of the crisis and as Ryanair looked to recruit more cockpit staff.
Brian Strutton, general secretary of Balpa, said: "Given Ryanair's previous hostility towards unions, today's 
agreement is a historic one."
He added that while the union was "initially sceptical" about the airline's sincerity in offering recognition to Balpa 
and other unions, "our conversations and meetings with them have shown that they are genuine in wanting a 
constructive trade union relationship". The move marks a capitulation by chief executive Michael O'Leary, who had 
previously vowed never to recognise trade unions in his 23 years at the helm of the budget carrier. He has long 
castigated union efforts to establish a foothold in Ryanair and subjected them to withering criticism.
Balpa said it will be opening an election for five Ryanair company council representatives who will lead negotiations 
on issues such as pay, hours, rostering and holidays. It will also elect an advisory group for Ryanair's contractor 
pilots who are not directly employed by the company.

 The following is a summary of top news stories Tuesday.----------COMPANIES----------Informa said its takeover of 
UBM will lead to an events giant benefiting from increased scale and industry specialisation, after the two parties 
confirmed an almost GBP4 billion mixed cash-and-shares offer by Informa for UBM. Informa said the enlarged 
company, likely to have a market capitalisation of more than GBP9 billion, will create value for shareholders through 
"increased operating scale and industry specialisation". Informa expects operating synergies including at least 
GBP60.0 million of annual recurring pretax cost savings, with around GBP50.0 million of this to come in 2019, 
which will come from scale efficiencies and the reduction of duplicate costs. For each UBM share, Informa is to offer 
1.083 Informa shares, plus 163.00 pence in cash. Based on the closing price of 746.00p per Informa share on 
January 15, the last business day before the offer was made, this values UBM at around GBP3.90 billion and 
971.00p per UBM share. This would be a premium of 30% to UBM's 747.50p closing price on January 15.----------
Ryanair Holdings said it has signed a formal union recognition agreement with the British Airline Pilots Association, 
who will now be the sole representative body for the company's UK pilots. 
"Today's agreement between Ryanair and BALPA shows that Ryanair can work with unions that wish to work with 
us to promote the interests of both our pilots and our customers," said Ryanair's Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson. 
The UK region accounts for almost 100 of Ryanair's 400 plus current aircraft fleet and over 25% of pilot body. 
Earlier in January, the Irish budget airline said all of its UK pilots had agreed to accept a 20% rise in their 
paychecks, after pilots based at its biggest UK operation, London Stansted, initially had rejected the deal. The pilots 
had initially rejected the offer over concerns about pilot staffing, after Ryanair suffered shortages starting last 
Autumn, and about employment terms and conditions.----------Miner Anglo American said its De Beers diamond 
business saw an encouraging sales performance in its first sales cycle of 2018, despite sales coming in lower than 
the first cycle of 2017. De Beers generated sales of USD665.0 million in the sales cycle, 8.8% behind the 
USD729.0 million generated in the first cycle of 2017, but 46% ahead of the USD455.0 million reported for the tenth 
cycle of 2017. "Following positive early signs for diamond jewellery sales over the holiday season in the US, the 
need for the industry to restock led to increasing demand for our rough diamonds in the first sales cycle of 2018. 
This seasonal restocking demand does usually see a larger share of annual purchases being planned into the first 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: UK Mortgage Approvals At Lowest Since January 2015
sales cycle of the year by our customers, resulting in an encouraging sales performance," De Beers Chief 
Executive Bruce Cleaver said.----------PZ Cussons said profitability was hit in the first half of its financial year by 
reduced margins in Europe and Africa, despite strong performance in Asia, though revenue for the period rose. 
Pretax profit for the six months to November was up 37% to GBP34.2 million from GBP24.9 million. However, 
removing exceptional items, adjusted pretax profit fell 15% at reported exchange rates to GBP34.0 million from 
GBP40.2 million, falling 14% on a like-for-like basis. For the half-year, PZ Cussons posted net exceptional income 
of GBP200,000. However, the previous year it incurred costs of GBP15.3 million due to foreign exchange losses in 
Nigeria and a reorganisation project. Revenue for the half rose 1.9% year-on-year to GBP385.4 million from 
GBP378.2 million, driven by a strong product pipeline, the company said. The personal care products maker has 
maintained its interim dividend at the same level as last year, paying out 2.67 pence per share.----------Domino's 
Pizza Group said it saw double-digit growth in sales in the fourth quarter of 2017, with its performance ahead of 
management expectations. Total systems sales rose 18% to GBP321.8 million in the fourth quarter from GBP272.4 
million a year before, with organic growth of 10%. System sales were up by 8.9% in 2017 as a whole on an organic 
basis, with high growth in both established and newer markets. UK & Republic of Ireland systems sales for the

Ryanair said it would allow Britain's pilots' association to start negotiating on issues such as pay and holidays after 
the Irish budget airline recognised a trade union for the first time in its 32-year history.
Europe's biggest budget airline was forced last year to recognise unions in order to avoid a Christmas strike, after it 
had to cancel 20,000 flights earlier in the year due to a shortage of standby pilots.
Ryanair thanked the British Airline Pilots' Association (BALPA) for its constructive engagement and called on others 
around Europe to follow suit.
"Given Ryanair's previous hostility towards unions, today's agreement is an historic one," Brian Strutton, General 
Secretary of BALPA, said in a statement.
"While we were initially sceptical about Ryanair's sincerity in offering recognition to us and other unions, our 
conversations and meetings with them have shown that they are genuine in wanting a constructive trade union 
relationship."
BALPA said it would open an election for representatives among its members to lead negotiations with Ryanair on 
pay, holidays and the rostering of pilots. Issues with pilot rostering triggered last year's mass flight cancellations.
Ryanair is negotiating with other unions across Europe, who have demanded to meet collectively with Ryanair, 
saying that individual talks were unsatisfactory. The airline has so far refused those demands,

"We now call on these unions to stop wasting time and act quickly to deliver 20 percent pay increases to our pilots 
in February, and conclude formal recognition agreements, which they are presently sitting on," Eddie Wilson, chief 
people officer at Ryanair, said in a statement.
Pilots at all Ryanair's UK bases have voted to accept Ryanair's proposed pay increase, with pilots at Stansted 
approving the package earlier this month. Those votes were separate to negotiations with BALPA.
BALPA's Strutton also said that he hoped Ryanair would be able to agree deals with other European unions soon.
"I am hopeful that this is (the) beginning of a strong and mutually beneficial relationship between BALPA 
and Ryanair and I urge Ryanair to agree deals with pilot unions in other countries and with cabin crew unions," 
Strutton said. (Reuters)

The new chief executive of easyJet has taken a salary cut after he was awarded a higher base wage by the airline's 
board than his well-regarded female predecessor Carolyn McCall.
Johan Lundgren took the helm at the airline on December 1 with a starting salary of £740,000.
Dame Carolyn, who left in November to run broadcaster ITV, finished on a salary of £706,000. Her last full 
remuneration package was £1.5m, including bonuses and pension contributions.
Overall, easyJet has a gender pay gap of 52 per cent, the biggest of any company yet to have reported data under 
new government rules.
"At easyJet we are absolutely committed to giving equal pay and equal opportunity for women and men," Mr 
Lundgren, former Tui deputy chief executive, said yesterday.
"I want that to apply to everybody at easyJet and to show my personal commitment I have asked the board to 
reduce my pay to match that of Carolyn's when she was at easyJet."
It is not yet clear how much Mr Lundgren's total pay and bonus package will be for 2018. He also did not explain 
why he had come into easyJet on a higher salary than Dame Carolyn. A spokesman for the airline's board of

carrier with 52% gender pay gap
directors, whose remuneration committee is chaired by former Thomson and Tui executive Charles Gurassa, said 
they had "looked to secure the right candidate and the salary awarded reflected his experience and his previous 
salary".
Mr Lundgren's last full annual salary at Tui was (EURO)875,000 (£770,000).
During Dame Carolyn's seven years running easyJet, passenger numbers rose to record highs.
The company paid £1.2bn in dividends and gave investors a total return of more than 300 per cent, placing it behind 
arch-rival Ryanair but ahead of British Airways owner IAG.
Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: "Token gestures are no substitute for 
comprehensive action to address the gender pay gap."
Jo Swinson, who was minister for women in the last coalition government, said the fact Mr Lundgren had started on 
a higher salary "shows how easy it is, even for a company that has had a woman at the top and had during that 
time taken significant steps on diversity, to fall into the old trap", of placing a higher value on a male employee.
Ms Swinson, who is now deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, said that easyJet should be praised for "looking at 
this and deciding that something went wrong", however, and urged all large companies "to do the same checks" to 
ensure this sort of thing does not happen.
"There may be reasons for the new person to have higher pay, such as there being new responsibilities, but gender 
should never be the reason," she said.
Women are under-represented in top-paid pilot roles across the aviation industry - according to the British Women 
Pilots' Association, just 5 per cent of UK pilots are women.
Under Dame Carolyn, left, easyJet set goals to fill half the places in its engineering apprenticeship scheme with 
women, and that by 2020 a fifth of trainee pilots should be female.

LONDON (AP) - Budget airline Ryanair has signed a formal recognition agreement with the British Airline Pilots 
Association, a significant milestone in addressing the company's often testy relations with its employees.
The voluntary agreement means that union representatives will be involved in future negotiations on pay, hours, 
schedules and holidays.
Ryanair altered its stance on unions following a challenging period last fall in which thousands of flights were 
canceled following pilot scheduling errors.
The association's general secretary, Brian Strutton, says that "given Ryanair's previous hostility towards unions, 
today's agreement is an historic one."
Ryanair's chief people officer, Eddie Wilson, says the progress with pilots in Britain is in contrast to some other 
European Union countries "where we are still waiting for a response to our recognition proposals."

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair Holdings Plc. (RYA.L) Tuesday confirmed the signing of a formal Union 
Recognition agreement with British Airline Pilots Association or BALPA.    This agreement follows extensive 
negotiations with BALPA since Ryanair's December announcement that it was willing to recognise Unions for

accept pay increases of up to 20 percent, which had already been agreed by nine of other UK bases.    Ryanair's 
Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said, 'The UK accounts for 25% of Ryanair's fleet and pilot numbers. This 
agreement validates the decision of Ryanair's Board in December to recognise unions, and the fact that we have 
delivered pay rises of up to 20% and union recognition for our pilots in our largest market, shows how serious 
Ryanair is about working constructively with unions that are willing to work constructively with us.'

European pilot group demands Ryanair meet unions collectively

Ryanair pilots' unions demanded on Wednesday a joint meeting with management, saying individual talks on a new 
collective bargaining system were not satisfactory, according to a letter sent by the European Cockpit Association.
The letter dated Jan. 24, which was on European Cockpit Association notepaper and signed by 11 trade unions, 
also demanded that Ryanair commit by March 1 to introduce permanent direct employment contracts in accordance 
with the local laws of the country where staff are based.
Ryanair, in a statement, refused the idea of meeting unions collectively.
"Ryanair won't be meeting with any collective group of competitor pilot unions," it said, adding that such a grouping 
would have no legal standing or negotiating licence.
Spokesmen for the ECA and Irish trade union IMPACT declined to comment on whether the letter, seen by Reuters, 
represented their position.
Ryanair stunned the European aviation sector in December by announcing plans to recognise pilot unions for the 
first time in its 32-year history in a bid to stave off a series of threatened strikes.
Since then it has held meetings with a number of national trade unions on formalising the recognition and 
negotiating collective bargaining agreements.
But the letter, addressed to Ryanair's chief operating officer and chief people officer, said the airline was in several 
countries "de facto sidelining" the unions by "trying to push through each Ryanair base a unilateral, non-negotiated 
pay rise offer" with a number of conditions attached.
European pilot group demands Ryanair meet unions collectively
Ryanair, in a letter in response to ECA on Wednesday, described those claims as "materially inaccurate". The 
airline said last week that a majority of pilots based at London Stansted Airport had agreed to a 20 percent pay 
increase, which had initially been offered to all bases individually before Ryanair announced it would recognise 
unions.
Pilots have objected in the past to Ryanair's practice of dealing with pilots from its 87 bases separately and have 
called for negotiations either on a national or pan-European basis.
The airline in its response letter said that a pan-European group would be in violation of EU rules.
It said it was continuing to negotiate directly with unions in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, Italy, 
Spain and Portugal.
"Some of these are progressing well and some have made little progress due to slow or no responses from some 
national unions/company councils," Ryanair said in its letter to ECA.
The letter from the ECA made eight separate demands, including that Ryanair negotiate with all national pilot 
associations representing its pilots, that it include pilots not directly employed and that pilots be allowed to freely 
choose their own representatives. (Reuters)

Pilot representatives across Europe have jointly written to Ryanair calling for changes to how the airline approaches 
pay and union-recognition talks, and urging it to attend a meeting to discuss their concerns.
In a letter addressed to Ryanair's chief operating officer Peter Bellew and chief people officer Eddie Wilson, and 
seen by FlightGlobal, 11 unions – including BALPA, ANPAC, FPU and SNPL – identify seven areas for review if the 
budget carrier is to make their pledge to recognise unions "credible".
They say Ryanair should "meet, recognise and negotiate" with all the representative national pilot unions and 
associations that contact them.
"Not replying or meeting some of them is not an option, risks undermining Ryanair's credibility, and will be closely 
monitored by all of us during our respective negotiations," they say.
The unions argue that Ryanair should not interfere with the type of pilots chosen to represent the unions in their 
company councils or the representatives chosen for unions' own negotiating teams, and that talks with 
management and should not exclude pilots employed as contractors.
Ryanair should, they add, commit to offering all pilots the option of signing contracts "governed by the local laws of 
the country where they are based" by 1 March. Furthermore, as a "matter of principle" the airline should phase out 
"atypical employment" contracts or at least make them the exception, the unions assert.
But they raise the possibility that, where it is legal under the "applicable local law", and "without prejudice to future 
jurisprudence", the airline could offer an "opt-out option" for pilots wishing to remain in a contractor arrangement, if 
mutually agreed with the local pilot association.
Pilot unions take issue with Ryanair negotiating strategy Pilot representatives across Europe have jointly written 
to Ryanair calling for changes to how the air....
The unions are petitioning the airline not to seek pay deals with pilots outside of formal union negotiations, as such 
practice is "very unhelpful to maintain mutual trust, as it tries to sideline the very unions that Ryanair publicly claims 
to be willing to recognise".
Ryanair should also abandon its "management-imposed" employee representative committee (ERC) system, they 
propose.
Also on the list of demands are that any unilateral pay increase Ryanair chooses to negotiate with pilots should be 
accompanied by a "clear recognition" that these do not constitute a union-negotiated deal; any conditions attached 
to these pay rises should be rendered "null and void"; and that all offers should be backdated to 1 September 2017 
when the airline's rostering crisis started, "to ensure no pilot is treated better or worse than their colleagues".
Finally, the unions urge Ryanair to halt all legal proceedings related to "representative activities" undertaken by 
individual pilots, current or former union representatives, or pilot associations.
The unions want Ryanair to attend a meeting in Brussels on 26, 27 or 28 February.
Ryanair disclosed in December that it planned to recognise trade unions for the first time in its negotiations with 
pilots. It has since said it is engaged in recognition talks with pilot unions in Italy, Ireland, the UK, Spain, Portugal 
and Germany.
In response to FlightGlobal's request for comment, Ryanair highlights it refusal to meet with "any collective group of 
competitor pilot unions, a number of which represent countries where Ryanair doesn't even have bases or pilots".
It adds: "Any such group of unions has no legal standing or negotiating licence and will only delay our continuing 
recognition negotiations in a number of European countries."

good time at the end of last year. Ryanair infuriated passengers, investors, and its own staff before Christmas with 
a disastrous spate of cancelled flights, while Monarch collapsed altogether. Easyjet, however, were probably 
smirking in their Luton base. Analysts at CFRA are quietly confident the budget airline will have "benefited from 
other carriers' miseries". They maintain their "hold" rating but raise their target price to 1,750p, reflecting forecasts 
of improved operating margins, although capacity from others will return gradually.

The long-term logic sounds good for firms like retirement housebuilder McCarthy & Stone. Analysts at Peel Hunt 
like the shorter term as well, with a "buy" rating and a price target of 185p. Its latest trading update showed a 
forward order book up by 13 per cent as new site openings increased. However, one cloud on the horizon is the 
government's proposals to ban ground rents. That could add a £15m dent to profits in the second half if enacted.
The house always wins, they say, but that might not be true if the government changes the rules of the game. 
That's one of the threats faced by bookmaker Paddy Power Betfair, according to analysts at Barclays, who cite 
think tank proposals yesterday to make bookies pay more to problem gambling education and ban the use of credit 
cards for online gambling. A price target of 9,400p and an "overweight" rating remain unchanged for now, as Paddy 
Power Betfair will have the scale, global diversification and online presence to ride out a "storm of regulatory 
pressure".

Highlight: Ryanair has launched Ryanair Travel Credit, a new incentive that gives customers who book 
accommodation with Ryanair Rooms 10% back in credit to spend on flights.
Body
Any customer with a "MyRyanair" account who makes a booking on Ryanair Rooms will earn 10% back in credit, 
redeemable directly against flight purchases on Ryanair.com.For example, a customer who books a four-night stay 
in Barcelona for 400 will receive 40 Travel Credit directly into their MyRyanair account essentially giving them their 
next Ryanair flight for free (given Ryanair's average flight fare is just 41).Ryanair recently launched a major upgrade 
to the Ryanair Rooms website, as it continues on its journey to becoming the 'Amazon of Travel', offering an even 
wider choice of hotel, hostel, B&B, holiday villa and homestay options, all at the lowest prices. The new website 
features an improved dynamic search function and simplified booking experience, enabling customers to choose 
from over 1.2 million rooms worldwide.Travel Credit is the latest initiative as part of the "Always Getting Better" 
programme, including a personalised Ryanair.com website, a dedicated Chinese Ryanair website, Ryanair Tickets 
for concerts and events, Apple Pay integration, long haul Air Europa flights on sale on Ryanair.com and a new 
partnership with the Erasmus Student Network.Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said: "We're pleased to launch Ryanair 
Travel Credit, our latest "Always Getting Better" improvement, offering customers 10% travel credit when they book 
accommodation on Ryanair Rooms, which can be redeemed directly against flight purchases.This new initiative is a 
huge benefit to our customers who will see the same hotels and accommodation in Ryanair Rooms as they will in 
other popular booking sites, but with the major difference being the 10% 'money back' they will receive to spend 
directly on flights when they book.Following a major upgrade to our Ryanair Rooms website, customers have even 
more choice, enhanced search options and a simplified booking process, ensuring they can choose their ideal 
accommodation, but always at the lowest prices and by offering this Travel Credit, all of our commission will be 
given back to the customer, resulting in even lower air fares.With our five accommodation providers, offering 
customers over 1.2 million rooms to choose from, ranging from 5-star hotels to hostels and B&Bs, and now the 
chance to earn Travel Credit towards flight purchases, there has never been a better time to book with Ryanair

Greetings from Davos, where delegates to the World Economic Forum believe Elton John and Emmanuel Macron 
may have solved ... Oh, come on. You didn't really think the Financial Times would pay to send Lombard to 
Switzerland, did you? More than 1,000 private jets have been descending on airports around the Swiss resort. But 
this columnist would struggle to gain editorial approval for an easyJet flight from Luton, price £52 (Pringles snack 
pack not included). In fact, it would be a struggle even to find a seat on EZY 2045 LTN-ZRH, judging by the lowcost 
airline's latest trading update. EasyJet said yesterday that the load factor on its aircraft increased by 2.1 percentage 
points in the three months to December 31, to 92.1 per cent. So, with flight capacity increasing 5.5 per cent, 
quarterly revenue rose 14 per cent to a forecast-beating £1.14bn.
And, unlike hand-wringing pianists or left-leaning theorists, easyJet had no qualms about profiting at others' 
expense. In fact, it admitted that it had prospered from rising inequality: "positive trading" was partly "as a result of 
the bankruptcies of Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia, as well as ... Ryanair's flight cancellations".
Not only have rivals' misfortunes reduced competitive pressure on prices, they have enabled easyJet to win assets. 
It has taken over operations from Air Berlin at Tegel Airport, and expects a first-year loss of just £60m.
Easyjet's cost per seat, excluding fuel, has been helped by competitors' woes, too, as passengers switching flights 
bought up empty seats, lifting the load factor. That limited the cost increase to 1 per cent, as forecast, for crew pay 
rises and weather delays.
EasyJet 's riches prove some airlines are more equal than others UK COMPANIES
Fuel costs - which are 79 per cent cent hedged for 2018 - are now set to fall: by £60m-£65m in the first half, year on 
year, and by £80m-£100m in the full year. Meanwhile, secondquarter bookings are ahead of this time last year, with 
60 per cent secured. Analysts therefore concluded that investors could only get richer. Some lifted their full-year 
pre-tax profit forecasts from £445m to £475m or £500m, and wondered if £357m net cash might hasten dividend 
increases.
However, at Luton as at Davos, the big question is how much longer can the wider inequality continue? Analysts 
have warned that the competitive advantage easyJet has gained from others' demise could disappear by summer, 
as capacity returns. It seems unlikely to return in equal measure, though.
Monarch's Luton slots have been taken by Wizz Air to fly to eastern Europe, not head-to-head with easyJet. Only 
40-50 per cent of Monarch's Gatwick slots are back on sale with British Airways owner IAG. IAG has just had its 
purchase of Air Berlin subsidiary, Niki, scuppered. And Air Berlin's Tegel capacity is already in the hands of 
easyJet.
Even if the Elton-Macron show sorts out global inequality by the end of the week, easyJet remains a winner. EZY 
2045 is a better look than a private jet.

EASYJET is reaping the rewards of a competitive airline industry, the carrier said yesterday in chief executive 
Johan Lundgren's first trading update at the helm.
Revenue soared, with the airline noting a positive trading environment thanks to capacity reductions and lower 
growth in its markets, "in particular as a result of the bankruptcies of Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia, as well as the 
impact from Ryanair's flight cancellations".
The trading update sent shares up just over five per cent.
Total revenue in the first quarter rose by 14.4 per cent to £1.1bn with an increase of 1.4m passengers through the 
period.
There was a 6.6 per cent increase in revenue per seat at constant currency.
The airline said the number of passengers carried increased by eight per cent to 18.8m overall, driven by growth in 
capacity of 5.5 per cent, and load factor up by 2.1 percentage points to 92.1 per cent.
Easyjet has been looking to capitalise on the demise of troubled carriers. Last month the airline confirmed it had 
acquired a substantial part of collapsed airline Air Berlin's German operations. It had already said in November that 
revenue trends for the first quarter had been encouraging, "primarily as a result of some capacity leaving the 
market".
Yesterday, Easyjet said it will release the summer 2018 schedule for its operations at Berlin Tegel airport shorty, 
with more frequencies and destinations.

It expects the headline loss from the 2018 flights to be around £60m.
The low-cost carrier's chief executive Lundgren said: "Easyjet delivered a strong start to the financial year with a 
significant growth in revenue in part driven by an increase in passengers flown".

A number of European airline bankruptcies and problems at rival Ryanair propelled easyJet to doubledigit revenue 
growth in the final quarter of last year.
The carrier yesterday posted a 14.1 per cent rise in sales for the three months to December compared with the 
same period in 2016, to £1.1bn.
Revenue per seat was up 8.4 per cent to £55.99, while cost per seat fell slightly to £54.34.
The carrier flew 18.8m passengers in the quarter, which was an 8 per cent increase on the final three months of 
2016.
Johan Lundgren, the group's chief executive, who took over from Carolyn McCall last December, said: "Clearly 
there has been less competitive pressure on certain routes - we've seen less capacity from Ryanair this winter.
"We clearly also had the changes that happened with Air Berlin and Alitalia that have given us benefits in these 
countries as well."
EasyJet shares rose 5.1 per cent to £16.43 yesterday, having climbed to a two-year high as investors anticipated a 
robust performance in its first update under Mr Lundgren. See Lombard

EasyJet Stock Up On Higher Q1 Revenues, Traffic; Sees Growth Ahead

Body
       LUTON (dpa-AFX) - Shares of easyJet Plc (ESYJY.PK, EZJ.L) were gaining around 5 percent in London 
trading after the low-cost airline reported Tuesday higher revenues, traffic and capacity in its first quarter. Looking 
ahead, revenue per seat at constant currency is expected to increase by mid to high single digits in the first half.  
Johan Lundgren, easyJet Chief Executive, said, 'easyJet delivered a strong start to the financial year with a 
significant growth in revenue in part driven by an increase in passengers flown and strong growth in inflight and 
ancillary sales as we offer more and better quality options for our passengers..... We expect to reach a series of 
milestones in 2018 including the roll out of our full summer schedule at our newly established base at Berlin Tegel, 
an increase in passenger numbers from 80 million to around 90 million.' 
 For the first quarter, total revenue increased 14.4% to 1.14 billion pounds from 997 million pounds last year.  
Passenger revenue increased 13 percent to 914 million pounds from prior year's 809 million pounds. The company 
reported an increase of 1.4 million passengers carried through the period, a 6.6% increase in revenue per seat at 
constant currency, a strong increase in ancillary revenue as well as a benefit from foreign exchange.  The number 
of passengers carried increased 8% to 18.8 million, driven by a growth in capacity of 5.5% to 20.4 million seats and 
load factor increasing by 2.1 percentage points to 92.1%.  Ancillary revenue continues to perform well, increasing 
by 20% to 226.3 million pounds. The company said the momentum from last year's product and pricing initiatives, 
particularly for Bags and Allocated Seating, is continuing into this year and benefiting from both higher loads as well 
as further product offerings brought to market.  The company experienced 1,051 cancellations in the first quarter, 
compared to 512 cancellations last year, with the biggest number of cancellations due to adverse weather 
conditions in December.  EasyJet said it has seen a positive trading environment based on the strength of its 
network and customer proposition, capacity reductions and lower growth in easyJet markets, in particular as a 
result of the bankruptcies of Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia as well as the impact from Ryanair's flight 
cancellations.  Underlying cost performance is strong and continues to be in line with guidance for the full year.  In 
London, easyJet shares were trading at 1,635.50 pence, up 4.61 percent.

UK budget carrier EasyJet is putting its consensus full-year pre-tax profit at £475 million ($662 million) following its 
acquisition of Air Berlin assets and the launch of a Berlin Tegel operation.
Its previous headline consensus, prior to the acquisition, had been around £505 million.
EasyJet, which has unveiled a first-quarter trading update, expects a £35 million benefit over the first half following 
a "positive" trading environment.
This includes capacity reductions in its markets, notably following the collapse of Monarch Airlines and Air Berlin 
and the impact of flight cancellations from Ryanair.
But EasyJet estimates an initial negative £60 million profit impact from the newly-acquired Tegel operation, which it 
picked up from Air Berlin. The Tegel flight programme commenced on 5 January.
EasyJet is aiming to release the Tegel summer schedule shortly. It says the transition process is "progressing well", 
with leases on Air Berlin aircraft secured and the registration transfer under way.
"The first ex-Air Berlin crew has now completed training and there is a strong recruitment pipeline over the next few 
months," the carrier says.
EasyJet is intending to raise capacity by 5% over the first half, excluding Tegel, and by 5-6% over the full year.
The carrier generated a 14% rise in revenues over the first quarter, increasing to £1.14 billion, the first results to be 
disclosed under newly-appointed chief executive Johan Lundgren.
EasyJet outlines trading and Tegel impact on full year UK budget carrier EasyJet is putting its consensus full-

EasyJet says it benefited from a 6.6% rise in revenue-per-seat at constant currency, as passenger numbers 
increased 8% to 18.8 million.
The airline hiked capacity by 5.5% and load factor improved by 2.1 points to 92.1%.
Headline cost-per-seat, excluding fuel, increased by 1%. EasyJet says underlying unit cost improvements – an 
efficiency programme delivered £28 million in savings for the quarter – have been offset by inflation as well as the 
effects of weather and air traffic control strike disruption.
Lundgren says the airline has had a "strong start" to the financial year. "We have great revenue growth, strong cost 
control, a robust operation and a strong balance sheet," he says.
Revenue per seat for the second quarter is expected to increase by mid- to high-single digits, partly resulting from 
timing of the Easter holiday period.

EasyJet (EZJ) has led the FTSE 100 higher, boosted by a jump in revenues as the budget airline group swept up 
business amid turbulence for rivals.
Shares in EasyJet jumped to the top of the FTSE 100, up 5.6% at &pound;16.50, helping the UK blue-chip index

The airline group announced a 14.4% jump in revenue in the three months to the end of December, saying it had 
benefited from a reduction in capacity from competitors.
The airline industry was last year hit by the collapse of Monarch Airlines in the UK, while Germany's Air Berlin and 
Italy's Alitalia also fell into administration. Chief EasyJet rival Ryanair (RYA.I) was meanwhile forced to cancel 
flights in a dispute with pilots.
The news also buoyed British Airways owner International Airlines Group (ICAG), which rose 2.2% to 664.4p.
Among mid-cap stocks, Pets at Home (PETSP) surged 7.6% to 195.8p after the pet shop chain announced a 9.6%

Ryanair complains to EU competition authorities over Poland

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair said it had filed a complaint to European competition authorities over a Polish airport 
company's alleged refusal to expand Warsaw's Modlin airport which Ryanair uses as its Polish base.
Ryanair is currently a market leader in Poland with around 30 percent share. Its biggest rivals include Polish state 
carrier LOT operating from Warsaw's main Chopin airport.
"Ryanair has confirmed that over the next five years it will double the number of passengers on its flights to Warsaw 
from 3 to 6 million annually," the company said in a statement on Friday.
"To service such a level of traffic, the infrastructure of the Warsaw Modlin airport needs to be expanded, which for 
nearly two years has been unlawfully blocked by the Warsaw Chopin airport,"Ryanair said.
The Polish state-owned airport company PPL has a 30.4 percent share in Modlin, which is about 40 km from 
Warsaw. PPL is also the sole owner of the Chopin airport, which is located within the city borders.
Plans to expand Modlin -- a small airport which gets very crowded -- have slowed down after the government's 
recommendation to build a large new airport in central Poland, about 100 km from Warsaw.
Experts have said that opening a new hub airport would likely lead to the closure of several existing airports in 
central Poland.
State carrier LOT has backed the plans for a new airport, which it sees as the pillar of its ambitious international 
expansion strategy. The plans envisage moving all passenger traffic from Chopin to the new hub.
Ryanair complains to EU competition authorities over Poland
Meanwhile, PPL told state news agency PAP that it disagreed with Ryanair's argument and had filed its own 
complaint to Polish competition authorities, saying Ryanair is abusing its position as the only airline operating from 
Modlin.
"In our assessment when it comes to the airport in Modlin, the source of the problem lies elsewhere -- no airline 
wants to land at an airport dominated by a single carrier," PPL told PAP.
Ryanair has opposed the airport, with Chief Executive Michael O'Leary calling the idea "stupid" and "a waste of 
money."
Some experts have said the new airport would struggle to become profitable and fill its capacity. (Reuters)

Aer Lingus set to hire 300 staff as long-haul routes soar
Aer Lingus set to hire 300 staff as long-haul routes soar

Highlight: Airline claims it beat Ryanair for punctuality 11 months out of 12 from Dublin Airport last year 
Body
Aer Lingus plans to hire 300 staff this year, which will bring its total staff in Ireland to 4,300. The new recruits will 
largely be made up of pilots and cabin crew.
The airline, which is owned by IAG, will also invest €10 million in 2018 in upgrading in-flight entertainment systems 
for economy seats on long-haul flights.
It aims to grow its lounge footprint in Dublin Airport this year while its loyalty scheme, AerClub, is expected to hit 
one million members.
As part of a growth strategy introduced in 2015, it also set a target of improving on time performance.
To achieve this, Aer Lingus invested €9.5 million of its own capital expenditure as well as €4 million per year on 
operating expenses in targeting on time performance, while its operating partners invested a further €23 million on 
behalf of Aer Lingus.
Chief operating officer Mike Rutter said the investment was paying off. Aer Lingus was ranked third most punctual 
airline in Europe, seventh mainline airline globally and tenth of all airlines worldwide for on time performance last 
year by global provider of digital flight information OAG.
Ryanair does not share its overall statistics. However, Aer Lingus beat Ryanair 11 months out of 12 on punctuality 
in Dublin Airport, Rutter said.
Aer Lingus has no intention of changing its baggage policy following recent changes by Ryanair. Ryanair 
passengers are now allowed just one small bag on board with holdalls and suitcases banned from its aircraft cabins 
unless they pay for priority boarding.
Aer Lingus set to hire 300 staff as long-haul routes soar
Aer Lingus has been growing its North Atlantic flights by 12 to 20 per cent per year. Rutter said this would continue, 
with announcements of new routes expected in late 2018 or early 2019.
Dublin and Shannon are most likely to see growth in transatlantic routes, while Aer Lingus will continue to invest in 
short-haul services from Cork.
Asked about cheap flights announced by Wow Air, Rutter said Aer Lingus would meet its competition head-on.
“Aer Lingus successfully grew its transatlantic business last year by 15 per cent in the face of head-to-head 
competition with Norwegian,” he said.
“We are in robust and rude health.”

Ryanair seals pay deal with crew at its 15 UK bases Airlines
Ryanair seals pay deal with crew at its 15 UK bases; Airlines

Ryanair appeared to move a step closer to resolving a long-running battle with pilots over wages and conditions 
after air crew in the carrier's 15 UK bases accepted a pay deal.
The deal, which includes Stansted, the carrier's biggest base which last year rejected an improved offer, helped 
push up Ryanair's shares by almost 3 per cent to 1,653p, although they are still far below the six month peak of 
1,979p.
However, some pilots suggested that the votes were far from resolving complaints about terms and conditions. 
While Ryanair said the deal represents wage increases of up to 20 per cent for aircrew, one UK based pilot said it 
was essentially the same offer that had been rejected by Stansted. Many had not wanted a new ballot for fear that it 
could affect future negotiations between Ryanair and the pilots' union, Balpa, he said. "This has not ended by a long 
shot," said the pilot, who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions.
Ryanair remains in negotiations with pilots in Spain, Italy, Ireland and Germany, which have all threatened strikes. 
Ryanair refused to comment.
Ryanair's dispute with pilots blew up after the carrier was forced in September to cancel thousands of flights due to 
rostering failure and crew shortage.
Many crew have long resented the carrier's refusal to recognise unions and the fact that about half its pilots work as 
contractors. Pilots were emboldened by the crisis to push for better terms.
Ryanair seals pay deal with crew at its 15 UK bases Airlines
In December, Ryanair was forced by strike threats to recognise pilot unions in seven EU countries to avoid 
disruption during Christmas week. In Ireland, a majority of pilots at the Cork and Shannon bases had agreed to the 
pay increases, the carrier said. However, about 35 per cent of Dublin pilots had not voted and so would not receive 
the increase.

LOW-COST carrier Ryanair said yesterday pilots across all 15 of its UK bases, including London Stansted, have 
accepted a pay rise it hopes will bring an end to discontent that led to strike threats over the festive period.
The airline said pilots had voted in secret ballot to back pay increases of up to 20 per cent, which will be paid next 
week in the January payroll.
The progress comes after Ryanair said it would recognise unions for the first time last month, in an effort to avoid 
Christmas strikes, after already being blighted by flight cancellations earlier in the year because of pilot roster 
troubles.
The airline said the majority of its pilots in Ireland had already agreed to the pay increases, and that it had asked 
the remaining Dublin pilots to vote on the rise by 17 January. Ryanair said it was "disappointed" no such vote was 
organised among its remaining Dublin pilots.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) confirmed on Thursday that all 15 of its UK pilot bases - including London Stansted 
which had previously rejected an improved pay deal - have now voted in a secret ballot to accept pay increases of 
up to 20%. ADRs climbed 1.4% intraday.
The increases, which will be paid next week in the January payroll, bring Ryanair's pilot pay in the UK to 20% more 
than competitor 737 operators (Norwegian and Jet2), the company claimed in its statement.
The budget carrier is continuing its recognition discussions with BALPA, the UK pilot union, but had agreed the pay 
increases should not be delayed by the negotiations, which are "proceeding quickly." Ryanair and BALPA agreed to 
offer these pay increases to the six out of 15 UK bases, which had not previously accepted them.
The company said a majority of its pilots in Ireland have already agreed to these pay increases at the Cork and 
Shannon bases, and a majority of pilots in Dublin who are contractors or new joiners have already agreed with the 
deal.

Ryanair pilots at each of its 15 UK bases, including its largest company-wide base at London Stansted, have voted 
to accept pay increases of up to 20% that many had rejected last year, the Irish airline said on Thursday.
The reversal follows Ryanair's decision to recognize unions for the first time in its 32-year history in order to avoid a 
Christmas strike after it was forced to cancel 20,000 flights earlier in the year due to a shortage of standby pilots.
Ryanair added that it had asked the one-third of its Dublin pilots yet to accept the pay increases to vote on its 
proposals by Jan. 17 and was disappointed that no such vote was organized.
Discussions with the pilots' unions are progressing slowly, it said. (Reuters)

The arrival of Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair and growth for major airlines like Lufthansa have delivered a record 
number of passengers for Germany's largest airport in Frankfurt.
Strong numbers in December also helped to lift the number of passengers that passed through Frankfurt to 64.5 
million in 2017, which was an increase of 6.1 per cent on 2016, airport operator Fraport said Monday.
Fraport head Stefan Schulte had previously forecast a 5-per-cent rise in passenger numbers.
In 2016, the airport actually saw a drop in passenger numbers and responded by redirecting its focus to low-coast 
carriers like Ryanair.
There was also a 3.8-per-cent annual rise in cargo handled at Frankfurt airport in 2017, which reached 2.2 million

Just Eat led the FTSE 100 to another record yesterday after Barclays forecast that a looming ban on credit card 
transaction fees would end up boosting profitability.
The takeaway ordering website had been under pressure in recent days after it introduced a 50p surcharge on all 
UK orders to counter the card fee ban. The group had previously levied a 50p card processing fee on the restaurant 
rather than the customer.
Most customers will see little difference as restaurants were likely to pass on the fee at checkout, said Barclays. 
But, since about 30 per cent of Just Eat orders are settled in cash, the upfront levy could generate an extra £15m of 
extra revenue for Just Eat, meaning 2018 results will come in well ahead of consensus expectations, it said.
Barclays also argued that Just Eat's 32 per cent stake in a Brazilian joint venture is under-appreciated, given it is 
already larger by orders than the UK business was in 2014. It put a £10 valuation on the stock, which closed 4.7 per 
cent higher at 803.8p.
Brent at $70 a barrel meant commodity stocks supported the wider market, with the FTSE 100 gaining 14.43 points 
or 0.2 per cent to 7,762.94.
EasyJet led the airlines higher after a UBS consumer survey found no evidence of a slowdown in UK ticket 
spending. UBS retained "buy" advice on EasyJet (up 3.9 per cent to £15.37) and IAG (1.6 per cent firmer at 668p) 
while upgrading to "buy" on Ryanair (ahead 1.8 per cent to (EURO)15.79).
Appetite for Just Eat grows after projected boost to profitability; London
"While European airlines operating margins and profitability are already at record levels, the bull run can continue 
thanks to a supportive economy, ex-fuel cost controls, continued consolidation and improvements in capacity 
discipline," said UBS. "We are one year further into what is now nine years of recovery so earnings momentum in 
our view is more important than relative valuation multiples."
Greene King lost 6 per cent to 526.2p and Mitchells &Butlers was 0.7 per cent weaker at 267.6p. Numis 
downgraded both pub groups to "reduce", citing the managed operators' higher operational gearing and lower 
ability to pass on wage inflation than those with a tenanted estate.
Disappointing updates from Marks and Spencer and Tesco were the focus among the retailers, but it was Card 
Factory that led the sector lower with a 20 per cent drop to 225.8p. Comments from management about a long-term 
sales slowdown cast doubt over whether Card Factory's usual 15p special dividend will materialise in October.
Following talk of a sizeable placing by an institutional investor at 199p apiece, Barclays retreated 2.5 per cent to 
196.1p. Separately, KBW downgraded Barclays to "underperform" with a 180p target price.

Ryanair keeps big investors onside after eventful year
Ryanair keeps big investors onside after eventful year
Business World (Digest)

Several institutional investors are backing Ryanair to bounce back from a pilot rostering mess-up and a decision to 
recognize unions that jolted confidence in Europe's most profitable airline.
The mishandling of staff holidays caused thousands of flight cancellations, angered passengers and helped pilots to 
secure union recognition for the first time in Ryanair's 32-year history, sending the share price down 9% in one day 
in December.
The holiday rota errors were a rare serious slip-up by Chief Executive Michael O'Leary, whose formula of dirt 
cheap, no-frills travel has transformed the continent's airline sector and handed his shareholders big returns.
O'Leary had said hell would freeze over before he would welcome unions into Ryanair. The company now says 
dialog with organized labor will help the business.
Analysts say it will inflate its costs and could reduce the flexibility that helped it steal chunks of business from 
traditional airlines such as Lufthansa and Air France-KLM.
Top shareholder HSBC Global Asset Managers has cut a quarter of its Ryanair stake, according to a filing last 
month. HSBC declined to comment on the decision.
But other big Ryanair shareholders are maintaining or adding to their holdings.
"Because the share price has fallen, it has become, in our opinion, compellingly attractive," said Rory Powe, who 
manages European growth stocks at Man GLG and added to his Ryanairholdings in December. "I don’t 
see Ryanair’s cost advantage being eroded by anything more than an immaterial amount."
Ryanair keeps big investors onside after eventful year
Ryanair's longer-term record as an investment may help explain why top shareholders appear reluctant to drop it.
The shares are up 150% over four years as it tackled a reputation for shoddy services and wooed higher-paying 
business passengers. Shares in its most successful rival, Easyjet, have barely moved in that time.
Analysts agree upcoming union negotiations will be crucial, amid questions over whether O'Leary's pugnacious 
management style is still appropriate for a company that was once an upstart challenger but now dominates 
European short-haul air travel.
"A unionized Ryanair will still be profitable, cash generative and value-creating in our view but will be a markedly 
different company," HSBC analysts said last week, rating the shares "reduce."
HSBC believes Ryanair unit costs could rise by 20% by 2020, with unionization and the localisation of contracts, 
and that Ryanair's talks with continental unions could be tough, ."..and airline strikes in these markets are 
commonplace."
Bernstein sees a short-term rebound in the stock but believes Ryanair is "cornered" - profitability per passenger will 
fall if it continues to expand at the current pace but a slowdown in expansion will cause earnings to decline.
Other big Ryanair institutional investors acknowledge the challenges but believe that, with its cost base still below 
rivals, it can still make bumper profits as the euro zone economy picks up steam, industry capacity growth eases 
and prices recover.
Ryanair has said it does not expect its costs to increase significantly.
Jonathan Fearon, who runs the Aberdeen Standard European Growth fund, said the market seemed to be pricing in 
the idea that Ryanair's cost advantage will disappear.
But he said staff costs were only one of many advantages in Ryanair's broad "ultra-low-cost" business model.
Fearon indicated Ryanair was still a favorite: it was a "category killer" in short-haul that stood to gain from Alitalia's 
troubles and as industry capacity growth slows, boosting fares.
Tony Gibb, investment director at another Ryanair shareholder, Fidelity, said the company's significant cost 
advantage, even over EasyJet, was "sustainable" and last month's share slump was "probably overplayed."
"There is negative press and the share price has come off quite meaningfully but that is probably more of an 
opportunity than anything else," said Gibb. (Reuters)

Ryanair reminds customers of new baggage policy
Ryanair reminds customers of new baggage policy

Ryanair has today reminded customers of its new baggage policy, as part of its “Always Getting Better” programme. 
Ryanair has introduced new reduced checked bag fees (and increased check-in bag sizes). The airline says this is 
to encourage more customers to check in bags and reduce the number of customers with 2 bags at the boarding 
gates. 
Ryanair claims too many customers were availing of Ryanair’s improved 2 free carry-on bags service, and with high 
load factors (95% in Dec) there is not enough overhead cabin space for this volume of carry-on bags, which is 
causing boarding/flight delays.
Ryanair has introduced bag policy changes on all flights as follows: &bull; The check-in bag allowance has 
increased from 15kg to 20kg for all bags &bull; The standard check-in bag fee has been cut from €/&pound;35 to 
€/&pound;25 for this 20kg bag &bull; Only Priority Boarding customers (including Plus, Flexi Plus & Family Plus) will 
be allowed to bring two carry-on bags on the aircraft* from 15th January 2018 &bull; All other (i.e. non-priority) 
customers will only be allowed to bring one smaller carry-on bag on board the aircraft, while their second (bigger) 
wheelie bag must be placed in the hold (free of charge) at the boarding gate from 15th January 2018
Speaking today, Ryanair’s Chief Marketing Officer, Kenny Jacobs said, "We’re reminding our customers that from 
Monday (15th January 2018), only Priority Boarding customers will be allowed to bring two carry-on bags on the 
aircraft. All other customers will be allowed to bring one smaller carry-on bag on board, while their second (bigger) 
wheelie bag will be placed in the hold (free of charge) at the boarding gate. This will speed up the boarding of flights 
and eliminate flight delays, alongside our new checked bag policy which offers our customers lower bag fees for a 
33% increase in their checked bag allowance."

Highlight: Once the brash, aggressive public face of Ryanair, these days its chief executive is more likely to be 
spotted at the racetrack. Will he extend his contract when it ends next year with his 60th birthday looming? 
Body
Michael O’Leary ended a difficult 2017 on a personal high note. His horses, wearing the colours of his Gigginstown 
Stud, had eight winners from the 28 races over the four days of the high-profile Leopardstown Christmas Festival, 
one of the highlights of the Irish jump racing calendar. It was a remarkable success rate. A smiling O’Leary was 
photographed hugging one of his young daughters in the winners’ enclosure. Winner all right, as the saying in the 
sport goes.
The same couldn’t be said for his business year. While Ryanair, his airline, continued to grow, its speed of growth 
slowed. Its share price came back sharply. All sorts of doubts arose as to the company’s ability to cope with 
changed circumstances. Indeed, his own future as the company boss was called into question. His contract as chief 
executive ends in 2019 but, as he approaches 60, will the man who is arguably Ireland’s most successful 
businessman extend it?
Other than at the racetrack we may not see that much of the Ryanair chief executive in public in the coming 
months. And he may not be that happy in the office either, given how he is going to have to change his behaviour. 
He may have been reluctant initially to become a public figure, but after a while it seemed that, having come to 
enjoy the role of the pantomime baddy generating sizeable publicity for Ryanair, he couldn’t shut up. Now he has to.
Those famously provocative lips of his were too loose last year at just the wrong time, particularly when, in 
September, just after a damaging cancellation of hundreds of flights, he said pilots, whom he has never particularly 
liked, didn’t work particularly hard.
A subsequent apology and clarification as to what he really meant didn’t undo the damage. The pilots had him over 
a barrel because he didn’t have enough of them to fly all the shiny new aircraft he had purchased –with hangar-
loads more due to arrive. It is other Ryanair executives who will do the talking for now.
Matt Cooper on Ryanair
This development – the passing of responsibility to others - is almost as fascinating as the announcement itself, just 
before Christmas, that the airline would seek to negotiate arrangements with its pilots and cabin crew through a 
traditional industrial relations mechanism involving trade unions.
O’Leary often sends managers off to do negotiations on Ryanair’s behalf, but with very strict instructions to concede 
little and to do much as they are told by him. Many have come back delighted with the deals they have done – such 
as agreeing terms with an airport to launch new routes - only to find O’Leary wants an even better one. And they 
are sent back to renegotiate. Only if he is satisfied is the deal done.
Those managers sent to deal with the unions apparently are saying interesting things. Peter Bellew was brought 
back to Ryanair from his new job in Malaysia and given the position of chief operating officer. Pilots at Stansted 
recently recorded secretly a meeting with him and released details to the media. Bellew was heard to concede that 
the airline had grown too fast and had lost the trust of its pilots and that his biggest concern was trying to retain 
them.
It is almost impossible to imagine O’Leary admitting anything like that in such a meeting with anyone, let alone 
pilots. The question now is whether or not Bellew was doing O’Leary’s bidding, whether it was a tactic to support 
the greater strategy.
O’Leary is a complete pragmatist, of course. He has never been afraid to change course if he felt it would suit 
Ryanair better.
He was widely disbelieved in 2013 when he said Ryanair would start being nice to customers. It was said that he 
would be unable to deliver upon his promise. But “Always Getting Better” did so in spades, the market value of the 
company climbing from €7 billion to €17 billion in four years as passenger numbers and profits soared. Becoming 
nice wasn’t that difficult, however, and more to the point, it didn’t cost much.
Ryanair can protest that it was preparing for union recognition as a necessary step in its continued growth – 
particularly in increasing its business in heavily unionised countries like France – but this is a more difficult change 
for O’Leary to accept and adopt.
It goes against one of his core beliefs: that unions damage a business. It goes against his previous promises that 
he would rather close the airline than deal with unions. On another occasion he said he would cut off his arm first.
Now he is going to have dig deep into his pocket and some suspect these costs may be far greater than the €100 
million per annum estimate that has circulated widely.
The unions, after all, have the upper hand for the first time and in the absence of an emergence of a multitude of 
skilled pilots looking for a job – because a number of other airlines have shut - they will continue to hold it.
Some of the potential problems of union recognition have not been aired publicly in great detail, but they are 
appreciated and feared within Ryanair. One is that it may curtail the great flexibility Ryanair has had in opening and 
closing routes with a speed that unionised airlines could only envy, moving pilots and crews wherever the company 
wanted at very short notice. This has been one of the most important aspects of Ryanair’s success.
Another was the pay structure Ryanair has employed, often keeping many pilots off the payroll, with all the 
additional savings that gives to the company, by insisting they are self-employed contractors. If they fly their hours, 
they are paid well, but if they don’t, the cost to Ryanair is contained. The base pay at Ryanair is lower than at most 
airlines, even if pilots do well when they work their full 900 flying hours per annum. Changing that could be very 
costly.
What will be most interesting to watch in 2018 is the shape of the new industrial relations machinery that emerges 
at Ryanair. To date, Ryanair has only dealt with employee representative councils from staff at each base, making 
sure that professional union officials, who might also be involved in negotiations at rival airlines, could not be part of 
Matt Cooper on Ryanair
any talks. That the employees were only dealt with at each base, rather than on a pan-European basis, seemed to 
be a tactic of divide and conquer.
One of the most interesting developments Ryanair has faced is the call to deal with a new European Employee 
Representative Council, a full company collective body that would represent more than 4,000 pilots. Will Ryanair 
deal with this one body or will it insist that if it deals only with unions, rather than employee representative councils, 
it will do so at each individual base?
Ryanair did have some positive news to report last week. Most airlines would be thrilled if their passenger numbers 
grew 10 per cent to 129 million in 2017. This was a slower rate of growth than in 2016, when passenger numbers 
increased 15 per cent to 117 million, but 10 per cent remains impressive. Even after the two controversial 
cancellation crises that caused it so much reputational damage, the airline said it carried 9.3 million passengers in 
December, a 3 per cent rise over the same month in 2016.
It also filled 95 per cent of the available seats on its aircraft last month compared to 94 per cent in December 2016. 
It cited lower fares for the increase.
Figures like this have helped Ryanair’s share price to recover off the low of €14.21 to which it fell in September, 
knocking about €2 billion off the company’s peak market capitalisation.
By Thursday the shares were priced at €15.36 each. While that remains well off the €17.50 high they’d achieved 
last summer, it shows that some investors have regained their faith in the company’s ability.
The danger for Ryanair investors is that it will no longer command the premium rating that has made it the most 
valuable of airline stocks. The fear is that it will become just like the others.
It may be part of the natural maturation of a company as it grows to the size that Ryanair now is, but one of the 
things investors will want to know is how satisfied or motivated O’Leary will be at the prospect of running a company 
where he has to treat the unions as a partner.
Ryanair will not comment on the progress of its talks with the unions, but has indicated that they may take months. 
So we may not see O’Leary in public again until the Cheltenham festival in March, where he has enjoyed so much 
success. And where he might limit his chat to the racing.
Today FM’s horseracing specialist, John Duggan, has followed O’Leary’s sporting career with great interest. “From 
my observations over the years, Michael O’Leary takes racing as seriously as he does Ryanair,” Duggan said.
“He had four winners at Cheltenham last year and with Apple’s Jade, Road to Respect and the exciting Samcro part 
of this year’s battalion, I expect the maroon and white silks, a trilby and colourful quotes in the winners’ enclosure 
once again.”
So which is the better bet? Ryanair shares or O’Leary’s Cheltenham horses?

Ryanair's decision to enter talks on recognising unions for both pilots and cabin crew, disclosed last month, will 
create a "markedly different" company, HSBC has predicted in an analyst note.
"A unionised Ryanair will still be profitable, cash-generative and value-creating, in our view, but will be a markedly 
different company," writes HSBC, recommending a "reduce" option on Ryanair stock.
The bank expects that Ryanair's move on union recognition will lead to a more sustainable business model for the 
airline though adoption of local, direct and unionised employment, but warns that challenges are likely to flare up, 
especially in continental Europe.
"We expect unions in continental Europe will insist on localised direct employment, a key issue for staff. 
Consequently, negotiations in Ireland and the UK –where staff are already locally employed – will come first and be 
simple. Thereafter it will get tougher, and airline strikes in these markets are commonplace. Ryanair cannot 
threaten to exit Italy, Spain or Germany," argues HSBC.
Ryanair's move came as the airline faced strike action slated to begin on 20 December 2017.
The Irish low-cost carrier's chief executive Michael O'Leary had indicated in February 2017 that he might look to 
depart the airline if dealing with unions became a reality.
"When it becomes a dull, boring, f***ing growing-at-two-to-three-percent-a-year [airline], dealing with f***ing unions 
and strikes and all that kind of s***, I'll be gone. But we are not there yet," he told FlightGlobal at the time.

Disabled Passenger Allegedly Denied Help At Airport For Not Looking 'Ill Enough'
Disabled Passenger Allegedly Denied Help At Airport For Not Looking 'Ill 
Enough'
International Business Times News

Jan 04, 2018( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  A disabled 
passenger was allegedly refused help by airport staff that informed her that she "didn't look disabled." Nathalie 
Allport Grantham said had requested a wheelchair ahead of her Dec. 30 flight to get her to the gate and assistance 
with carrying her luggage onto the aircraft, but the woman was told that she was "wasting their time" by seeking aid. 
The 23-year-old deemed staff at the London Stansted Airport "disgusting" after they allegedly refused to provide 
assistance with her travel needs, the Independent[1] reported. Allport-Grantham suffers Ehlers-Danlos syndrome[2], 
a chronic disorder that affects one's connective tissue. While her disabilities aren't visible, she said, the condition 
requires her to sometimes use a wheelchair. Allport-Grantham reportedly requested wheelchair assistance when 
purchasing a ticket Nov. 5 for a flight with Ryanair instead of boarding with her own. Although she made the 
arrangements through Ryanair, the airports are tasked with fulfilling the requests through Omniserv, an 
external provider that claims to be "a people company" on its website[3]. The woman was given a wheelchair upon 
her early arrival, which her boyfriend — who was set to fly with her — pushed to a lounge area on the way to the 
gate. Shortly after she moved from the wheelchair to a lounge seat, she claimed the wheelchair was taken by an 
airport worker that guaranteed they'd return it. The male staffer never returned, which caused Allport-Grantham to 
walk to the Ryanair gate five minutes away. She then saw two other wheelchair fliers waiting before the gate, 
however."It's something I and everyone with chronic illnesses is used to, being judged and being called a liar." 
https://t.co/2mHUmCJ128[4] — BBC Radio 1 (@BBCR1) January 4, 2018[5]"I told the lady on duty that I had 
booked special assistance and needed help with my bags and to get onto the aircraft," Allport-Grantham told the 
Independent. "She looked at me and said, 'If you want someone to carry your bags, you have to pay £50.' I told her 
I had pre-booked disability assistance and I need help getting onto the aircraft." "She said, 'I'm actually waiting for 
someone who cannot walk, if you want to get on the plane I suggest you queue up like everyone else. If you don't 
want to carry your bag, it's £50 to have it put in the hold," Allport-Grantham continued. Allport-Grantham was the 
passenger that the worker was referring to, however. She had assumed the employee was waiting for someone that 
appeared to be more disabled. The staffer apparently said in a loud tone thereafter, "'I've got disabled people to 
help and you are wasting their time,'" according to the Independent. Ryanair offers a wide range of options for 
disabled fliers provided they request the service in advance online. Therefore, the airport is required to 
accommodate the special assistance request as long as the passenger follows the seemingly simple guidelines set 
by Ryanair[6].  "In order for the airport to effectively provide pre-booked special assistance, passengers must 
present themselves at the airport special assistance desk 2 hours before their flight departure time," the airline's 
website read. "Passengers with pre-booked assistance requirements should arrive at the boarding gate at least 30 
Disabled Passenger Allegedly Denied Help At Airport For Not Looking 'Ill Enough'
minutes prior to the flight departure." Allport-Grantham said on Twitter[7] that she still hasn't heard back from 
Ryanair and Stansted Airport's customer service following her apparent incident.  "You must educate your 
staff," Allport-Grantham wrote in a tweet. "I don't want anyone else with an invisible illness to go through what I 
went through yesterday."I still haven't heard back from customer service at @RyanAir[8] or @stanstedairport[9]. 
You must educate your staff. I don't want anyone else with an invisible illness to go through what I went through 
yesterday. @ehlersdanlosuk[10] @EDS_Today[11] @MarfanFdn[12] @MarfanTrust[13] @Dysautonomia[14]

BUDGET carriers Ryanair and Wizz Air yesterday announced rising passenger numbers for December, with the 
latter growing traffic by 20 per cent.
The Hungarian airline said rolling annual traffic to December was up by 21 per cent to nearly 31m.
Wizz Air said passenger numbers for last month rose by 19.8 per cent on December 2016, with load factor - 
assessing how full its planes are - also on the rise.
That edged up 0.2 percentage points to 87.5 per cent.
Ryanair meanwhile, reported traffic rising by three per cent on December 2016 to 9.3m passengers, with load factor 
rising one percentage point to 95 per cent. Rolling annual traffic to December grew 10 per cent to 129m customers.
Both airlines are among those in the industry to be making Brexit contingency plans, after Ryanair confirmed earlier 
this week that it had applied for a UK licence to protect its operations in the event of a hard Brexit.

 Next kicked off the post-Christmas retail reporting season with holiday cheer, raising its profit guidance for its 
current financial year after better-than-expected full-price sales in November and December.
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open 0.2 points lower at 7,647.90, amid a strong pound. The blue chip 
index closed down 0.5%, or 39.67 points at 7,648.10 on Tuesday.
Next, the first UK retailer to update on Christmas shopping, has increased its central guidance for pretax profit for 
the year ending in late January by GBP8.0 million to GBP725.0 million.
The profit guidance range is now between GBP718.0 million and GBP732.0 million. Its previous range, given at the 
start of November, was for profit in a range of GBP692.0 million to GBP742.0 million. The new profit estimate would 
represent a fall in profit from the previous year of 8.3%, compared to the 9.3% drop previously forecast.
Total full price sales for the year are expected to grow 0.3%, having been previously forecast to drop 0.3%.
The upgrade, Next said, comes after better-than-expected full-price sales in the 54 days to December 24. Brand 
total full price sales were up 1.5% in the period, and were up 0.2% in the year-to-date. This 1.5% growth is an 
improvement on the minus 0.3% forecast given in November for the period. 
Irish air carrier Ryanair Holdings reported traffic statistics for December with traffic growing 3% to 9.3 million 
customers and load factor rising by 1 percentage point to 95%. Ryanair also said its rolling annual traffic was up 
10% to 129 million customers.
FTSE 250-listed defence contractor Babcock International Group said it signed an AUD200 million agreement with 
Australian Navy to provide maintenance support services.

"I am delighted that we have successfully achieved the next stage of the contract to look after Australia's ANZAC 
fleet. Babcock has a long and successful history of working with the Australian Navy and we look forward to 
continuing that relationship over the next 14 years," said Chief Executive Archie Bethel.
FTSE 250 residential landlord Grainger said it has exchanged contracts with Abode Hallam to forward fund and 
acquire a private rented sector to build to rent development properties in Eccy Village, Sheffield comprising of 237 
new purpose built homes, for GBP32 million.
Grainger said it expects the investment to generate a gross yield on cost of over 7% with completion of the project 
anticipated by the end of 2019. 
Still to come is the UK construction Purchasing Mangers' Index for December at 0930 GMT.
The reading is expected to come in at 52.7, slightly below November's reading of 53.1. The construction data 
follows Tuesday's UK manufacturing PMI, which was below expectations at 56.3 for December, having been 
forecast at 58.0
Sterling was quoted at USD1.3607 early Wednesday, higher than USD1.3553 at the London equities close on 
Tuesday.
In the US on Tuesday, Wall Street ended higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.4%, S&P 500 up 0.8% 
and Nasdaq Composite ending 1.5% higher. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices hit record intraday and closing 
highs.
In US economic news later Wednesday, there are MBA mortgage applications data at 1200 GMT and construction 
spending and ISM manufacturing PMI at 1500 GMT. In addition, the minutes of the Federal Reserve's December 
policy-setting meeting will be released at 1900 GMT, which could potentially shed light on the outlook for US 
interest rates in the new year.
"There has been a sense in markets that the Fed is gearing up to backtrack on its forecast for three rate hikes this 
year because of low inflation. The minutes could help explain how Fed members are juxtaposing lower inflation 
expectations with planning the same pace of rate increases," says David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets.
In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 0.8%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.1%. In Tokyo, 
financial markets are closed for a holiday.

 The following is a summary of top news stories Wednesday.----------COMPANIES----------Next said it is marginally 
upgrading profit guidance for its current financial year after better-than-expected full-price sales in November and 
December. Next, the first UK retailer to update on Christmas shopping, has increased its central guidance for group 
pretax profit for the year ending in late January by GBP8.0 million to GBP725.0 million. The profit guidance range is 
now between GBP718.0 million and GBP732.0 million. Its previous range, given at the start of November, was for

previously forecast. Total full price sales for the year are expected to grow 0.3%, having been previously forecast to 
drop 0.3%.----------Ryanair Holdings and Wizz Air Holdings reported growth in passenger numbers and load factor 
for the month of December. Irish carrier Ryanair said the number of customers carried rose by 3.0% to 9.3 million 
from 9.0 million in December 2016, while load factor rose to 95% from 94%. Its rolling annual traffic to December 
was up 10% to 129 million customers. On Tuesday, Ryanair confirmed that it is seeking a license to operate in the 
UK to avoid disruptions in case of a hard Brexit. Eastern and Central Europe-focused airline Wizz Air saw a 20% 
rise in the number of passengers carried to 2.2 million from 1.9 million the year before, and a load factor at 87.5%, 
up from 87.3%. Its rolling annual traffic was up 24% to 28.3 million customers.----------Grainger said it has bought 
and agreed to forward fund a build-to-rent development in Sheffield. The Eccy Village development has been 
bought for approximately GBP32.0 million. Grainger said it has agreed with Abode Hallam, who will develop the site 
to Grainger's specifications, to also forward fund the 237-home project. Grainger expects the investment to 
generate a gross yield on cost above 7.0% with completion by the end of 2019. Midlands-based contractor Winvic 
Construction will undertake construction work at Eccy Village, Grainger said. ----------Defence outsourcer Babcock 
International Group said its joint venture with UGL has been awarded a further five-year contract worth around 
GBP115.0 million to provide maintenance support services to the Australian Navy. The contract will start this month 
and will see the naval ship management joint venture with Australian engineering firm UGL provide maintenance 
work on eight ANZAC class frigates, Babcock said. The joint venture will provide maintenance for both the ships 
and their support facilities on Australia's east and west coasts, helping ensure the frigates stay in service until at 
least 2031.----------Troubled support services company Carillion said the UK Financial Conduct Authority has started 
an investigation into announcements made by the company. Carillion said the FCA is to look into "the timeliness

and content" of announcements made between December 7, 2016 and July 10 last year. The support services firm 
said it is cooperating "fully" with the financial regulator. Carillion had a difficult year in 2017, having issued its third 
profit warning in five months in November, though it received a boost in December after its financial covenant tests 
were pushed back from the end of December to April this year by its lenders. Chief Executive-Designate Andrew 
Davies is to join the company on January 22, having previously been expected to come aboard on April 2. ----------
MARKETS----------London share prices were higher with retailers among the blue-chip gainers after Next reported 
stronger-than-expected sales over Christmas. Next was up 6.8% near midday. The pound hit a fresh three-month 
high against the dollar in early trade of USD1.3613 but then retreated as data showed UK construction activity grew 
at a slower pace in December. Wall Street was pointed to a higher open following record closing highs on Tuesday. 
Attention will later turn to the minutes of the latest FOMC meeting, due at 1900 GMT. ----------FTSE 100: up 0.1% at

Ryanair applies for UK licence to shore up routes before Brexit

Ryanair recently applied for a British air operating licence in a move it said on Tuesday may be required to keep its 
small domestic UK service operating in the event of a hard Brexit.
Flying rights are currently governed by EU-wide deals and because it is not part of the World Trade Organization, 
the aviation sector has no natural fallback arrangement to protect flights if there is no deal between Britain and the 
European Union.
Ryanair, Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, follows fellow budget airline Wizz Air in applying for a 
separate licence in Britain via a UK subsidiary.
"A subsidiary company Ryanair UK filed an application on Dec 21 last for an Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) with 
the Civil Aviation Authority in the UK. This may be required for Ryanair's three UK domestic routes in the event of a 
hard Brexit in March 2019," the airline said in a statement.
Ryanair said last year that it planned to pivot its growth away from Britain over the next two years as it fears the lack 
of clarity over Brexit will cause major travel disruption and hit demand.
The Dublin-based airline's three intra-UK routes only account for around 2% of its business. (Reuters)

The reading is expected to come in at 52.7, slightly below November's reading of 53.1. The construction data 
follows Tuesday's UK manufacturing PMI, which was below expectations at 56.3 for December, having been 
forecast at 58.0

Ryanair Passenger Climbs Out Of Emergency Exit, Sits On Flight's Wing
Ryanair Passenger Climbs Out Of Emergency Exit, Sits On Flight's Wing

Jan 03, 2018( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  After waiting for 
a long time to disembark from a Ryanair flight at Malaga airport in Spain, a passenger got impatient and decided to 
exit the plane via its emergency gate, Monday. The 57-year-old Polish man, whose name was not released, lost his 
cool when passengers onboard flight FR8164 were told to wait before disembarking the plane. Taking his hand 
luggage along with him, he opened the emergency exit, climbed on top of one of the wings of the plane and sat 
there, Guardian[1] reported.  This led to the staff on the flight becoming anxious thinking the man might decide to 
jump onto the tarmac. 
The crew was then able to convince the man to return to the plane, where he was held until law enforcement 
arrived and arrested him for his deed. Flight in question arrived from London after getting delayed for an hour at the 
Stansted Airport on New Year's Day. It landed at Malaga at 11 p.m. local time (5 p.m. EST) without giving its 
passengers any explanation as to why it was delayed before taking off. Apart from this, after the flight reached its 
destination, the passengers were told to wait another half an hour before they could start disembarking. The 
additional delay caused the Polish man to grow impatient and take the illegal way out. Fernando Del Valle 
Villalobos, one of the passengers on the plane who witnessed the incident, told Mail Online: 'He activated the 
emergency door and left, saying, 'I'm going via the wing'. It was surreal.' Villalobos added, BBC[2] reported, 'He was 
sat on the wing for quite a while until the crew managed to get him back inside.' Raj Mistry, another fellow 
passenger at the scene, said the man suffered from asthma and struggled to breathe inside the plane. It was not 
immediately known whether the air conditioning system that, under normal circumstances should be turned on if the 
flight is grounded on the tarmac, was working or not. 'This airport security breach occurred after landing in Malaga 
airport on January 1st,' a Ryanair spokesperson said. 'Malaga airport police immediately arrested the passenger in 
question and since this was a breach of Spanish safety and security regulations, it is being dealt with by the 
Spanish authorities.' This is not the first time a Ryanair passenger tried to pull a similar stunt. In 2016, one 
passenger jumped from a disconnected bridge and sprinted across the tarmac towards a Ryanair flight in order 
make it in time for a flight to Gran Canaria, Spain. The incident was captured on video, where the man was seen 
running toward a Boeing 727 that had already pulled away from the terminal. However, he was soon apprehended 
by the airport staff and faced a hefty fine for his stunt, the Independent[3] reported.  [embedded content] [ 1]:

Low-cost airline Ryanair has applied for a British air operating certificate to ensure it will be able to continue working 
in the country after Brexit.
The move makes it the latest carrier to take such steps amid fears that a turbulent exit could cause disruption 
across the aviation market.
In October, Wizz Air, central and eastern Europe's largest low-cost carrier, announced that it was accelerating 
contingency planning for Brexit and applying for a British AOC and operating licence. EasyJet has also set up a 
EUbased airline to ensure that it can continue its intra-European flights regardless of the Brexit outcome.
Ryanair, Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, confirmed yesterday that a subsidiary, Ryanair UK, had 
filed an application on December 21 for an AOC with the Civil Aviation Authority. "This may be required for 
Ryanair's three UK domestic routes in the event of a hard Brexit in March 2019," a company spokesperson said.
Ryanair's three intra-UK routes, between London, Northern Irish and Scottish airports, account for just 2 per cent of 
its business.
Airlines are grappling with a range of regulatory puzzles in the wake of Britain's decision to exit the EU. These 
include agreeing a new legal basis for British airlines to operate flights between EU countries and ownership rules 
requiring airlines operating in the region to be majority controlled by entities in the bloc.
Ryanair seeks UK licence in pre-Brexit move Airlines
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, has long warned about the potential disruption that would be caused 
unless the pace of negotiations over post-Brexit aviation rules quickens. Last summer, he said that British travellers 
could face widescale cancellation of flights to popular summer holiday destinations from March 2019 if no quick 
progress was made.
Britain's £60bn aviation industry has made it clear that its preference is for maintaining access to the EU's Open 
Skies regime, which gives all EU airlines the right to fly between member states and domestically within member 
states.

Resilient IAG finds direction to outperform in a weak market; London

The first day's trading of 2018 saw British Airways owner IAG outperform a weaker London market.
Merrill Lynch upgraded IAG to "buy", largely on near-term trading hopes. While concerns about fuel costs and 
deflation are likely to resurface later in the year, Monarch's bankruptcy and Ryanair's "growth capitulation" have cut 
short-haul capacity, while Asian growth and resilient transatlantic corporate demand should support longhaul 
pricing, the broker told clients. "Having lost direction in 2017, we think IAG is now attractively valued and offers 
underestimated exposure to inflecting short-haul pricing," Merrill said. It put a 750p target on IAG, which closed 2.7 
per cent higher at 668.8p.
The index ended 0.5 per cent below its record high, down 39.67 points at 7,648.10.
Motor insurers faded on worries about the rising cost of reinsurance ahead of the new year policy renewals and 
likely exposures to a fire at the Liverpool Echo Arena car park, which destroyed about 1,400 cars. Admiral faded 2.6 
per cent to £19.49 and Direct Line was down 2.5 per cent to 372p.
Fashion retailer Asos climbed 2.2 per cent to £68.64, a four-year high, after Deutsche Bank turned positive with a 
£74 target. Deutsche cited growth prospects in Europe and the US, the launch last year of sportswear and 
cosmetics ranges, and a strength of customer economics that means new acquisitions pay back in just one year.
BT added 1.2 per cent to 275p on a Merrill upgrade to "buy". Its team said "BT is increasingly a mobile company" 
with its EE network "set to be the largest driver of growth through to 2021". The broker also predicted that the 
Resilient IAG finds direction to outperform in a weak market; London
launch this year of "G.fast" high-speed fixedline connections "will demonstrate the appetite of consumers to move 
up the pricing ladder".
Merrill also modelled reduced pension contributions based on a fund deficit of £10.4bn, meaning that BT's dividend 
could be fully covered by free cash from 2019.
"Whereas the pension market has lamented the collapse in bond yields since the last triennial review in June 2014, 
we don't believe a reduction in mortality improvements or upside from a restructuring of the scheme have been 
priced in," Merrill said.
Pâtisserie Holdings climbed 7.1 per cent to 378.5p on a report that it was preparing a £35m share issue to help fund 
the takeover of Gail's Bakery.
Peel Hunt estimated that, assuming a £150m purchase price, the acquisition would boost Patisserie's pre-tax profit 
by 30 per cent. "With earnings potentially progressing towards 25p per share, a share price approaching 500p could 
be achievable over the next two years if the company is able to make this acquisition," said Peel Hunt.

St Anton is - according to Glühwein slurpers and Google searches - the ski resort for those who can "handle the 
slopes like a god and the bar like the devil". Social climbers may head for Klosters, but downhill racers make for the 
toughest black runs in Austria, just an hour outside Innsbruck. In fact, so synonymous is the town with piste 
sophistication that Lombard recalls a ski bore nicknamed Baron St Anton (only partly because his surname was 
actually Stanton).
So this is not typically a destination associated with low-cost airlines.
Why, then, might British Airways owner IAG and Lufthansa have been vying to buy the low-cost Austrian airline 
Niki, founded by former racing driver Niki Lauda? And why might the market have deemed IAG's success such a 
coup, pushing its share price up 2.7 per cent yesterday and Lufthansa's down 1.4 per cent? One reason is that it 
represents a savvy consolidation deal in a market blighted by price wars and overcapacity. Niki was owned by Air 
Berlin, the heavily indebted German carrier which filed for insolvency in August. A few months later, Lufthansa 
agreed to buy half of Air Berlin's assets - including Niki, German subsidiary LGW and 20 aircraft - for (EURO)210m.
Lufthansa's deal hit the skids, though, when rivals including Thomas Cook's Condor noted that it would give the 
combined group an 82 per cent market share in Germany alone. Buying Niki also threatened to create a monopoly 
on dozens of routes in Austria, Germany and Switzerland.
IAG's budget airline deal still leaves easyJet and Ryanair on front foot UK COMPANIES
Initially, the market backed Lufthansa to allay EU competition concerns, as it had in 15 previous cases - its shares 
rose 40 per cent in the months after the Air Berlin insolvency. But when EU regulators twice deemed Lufthansa's 
remedies insufficient, the German group gave up on buying Niki to get the LGW deal through. IAG was able to bend 
the knees, and swoop.
A further reason the market likes the IAG-Niki deal is the apparently low price. Lufthansa had been seeking to buy 
Niki, including 800 staff and up to 15 aircraft, plus LGW, including 870 staff and 33 aircraft, for (EURO)210m. IAG is 
paying only (EURO)20m, plus a (EURO)16.5m liquidity injection, for Niki and those aircraft. LGW and Niki are 
different businesses, with different airport slots. But IAG boss Willie Walsh reckons Niki was the most viable part of 
Air Berlin.
And perhaps the most obvious reason for the market reaction is that IAG's low-cost arm Vueling, which will operate 
Niki flights through a new subsidiary, starts the year with the European expansion it promised at last year's capital 
markets day.
However, IAG may not be the first to the ski lift. With prices on some European routes up a quarter since Air Berlin 
stopped flying, and Vueling needing a new Austrian air operator certificate before it can resume Niki's low-cost 
offers, rivals easyJet and Ryanair may prove the bigger shortterm winners. If you can ski like a god, and aprÈs ski 
like the devil, who cares if you flew low-cost via St Ansted?

RYANAIR has applied for a UK licence to protect its operations in the event of a hard Brexit.
The airline has applied for a UK Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) in case no Brexit deal is agreed.
If the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) accepts the application, this would enable Ryanair to continue running domestic 
UK flights in the event of a no-deal situation.
A Ryanair spokesperson yesterday told City A.M.: "Ryanair today confirmed that a subsidiary company Ryanair UK 
filed an application on 21 December last for an Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) with the Civil Aviation Authority in 
the UK. This may be required for Ryanair's three UK domestic routes in the event of a hard Brexit in March 2019."
