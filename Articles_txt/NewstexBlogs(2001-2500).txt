Jun 20, 2016( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) Play Video[1]This week, 
the 'Brexit' (Great Britain possibly leaving the European Union) looks to dominate market headlines. The country 
has see-sawed back-and-forth between polls showing the country likely to leave, and others saying that the country 
would probably stay (see Market Fears Brexit: Volatility ETFs Take Full Advantage).It now appears as though 
sentiment is shifting and that voters are likely to keep Britain in the EU and we have seen a market rally to start the 
week as a result. However, recent polls still suggest that it will be close, and we aren't out of the woods just yet. 
Either way, what are the most impacted investments by this looming decision?What to WatchWell, in this week's 
video, we take a look at an ETF and a stock which could be greatly impacted by the results of the coming vote, and 
have been on the move in recent sessions too.For ETFs, the iShares British ETF (EWU) should be on investors' 
radar as it is a good barometer of how the British market at-large is trading. Plus, its sector breakdown—which we 
discuss in the video—makes the Brexit vote even more important (See British ETF in Focus on Brexit 
Talks).StockAnd for stocks, a host of financial institutions are on the move, but Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) looks to 
be under the microscope more than most. While the company is based outside of Great Britain, it does over a third 
of its traffic in the UK market and will be paying close attention to the vote as a result (see 5 British Stocks to Watch 
as Brexit Vote Looms).The company's CEO had called the EU the 'Evil Empire' in years' past, but apparently has 
changed his tune including putting 'vote remain' signage on Ryanair planes. Clearly, RYAAY is feeling the benefits 
of being in the 'empire' and is looking to stay in the bloc to keep people moving easily between the UK and the rest 
of Europe. We take a closer look at RYAAY's recent trading activity and how this company could move based on 
the vote.Bottom LineWatch our short video for a more in-depth discussion of these investments and a closer look at

View original post here[2].As reported previously[3], starting today politicians, bankers, influential leaders, chiefs of 
major global businesses, even actors and pundits will meet at the 64th Bilderberg meeting, set to take place over 
the next three days at the Taschenbergpalais Hotel in Dresden, Germany, where the official agenda will be quite 
different from what will really be discussed (read this for a full breakdown[4]). Former US Secretary of State Henry 
Kissinger is set to rub shoulders with disgraced ex-CIA (and current KKR director[5]) Director David H. Petraeus, 
Philip M. Breedlove, former Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Belgian Prime 
Minister Charles Michel, ex-British MI6 chief John Sawers and IMF boss Christine Lagarde at the The conference, 
surrounded by tight hundreds of heavily armed guards and concrete blocks, is notoriously secretive in its 
discussions which take place under Chatham House rules (nothing can be revealed), and regularly attracts 
demonstrations against what critics describe as a global meeting of western capitalists, politicians and academics 
who wield great power behind the scenes. No journalists are allowed to report on proceedings, however it will be 
attended by Richard Engel, chief Foreign Correspondent, NBC News, John Micklethwait, Editor-in-Chief, 
Bloomberg LP and Zanny Minton Beddoes, Editor-in-Chief of The Economist, which is owned by Rothschild, a 
name which figures intimately in all Bilderberg events.

(@RealAlexJones) June 8, 2016[10] Daniel Estulin, author of 'The True Story of the Bilderberg Group' describes 
the meetings as 'a shadow world government…. [threatening] to take away our right to direct our own destinies (by 
creating) a disturbing reality. 'Imagine a private club where presidents, prime ministers, international bankers and 
generals rub shoulders, where gracious royal chaperones ensure everyone gets along, and where the people 
running the wars, markets, and Europe (and America) say what they never dare say in public.' As reported 
yesterday, among the dozens of guests included this year are Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman, Alphabet Inc., 
which owns Google; Michael O'Leary, CEO, Ryanair; Thomas de Maizière, German Minister of the Interior; Col. 
Chris Hadfield, Astronaut; and Thomas Enders, CEO, Airbus Group. And while there is no way to report from inside 
the hotel, courtesy of social media we at least managed to get a glimpse of the world's richest and most powerful 
people as they made their way to the inner sanctum. The traffic jam: the kind of traffic jam you get at

Chinese company buys ailing Frankfurt Hahn Airport
Chinese company buys ailing Frankfurt Hahn Airport

Jun 06, 2016( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex) A Shanghai construction 
company has bought a majority share in the long-stagnant airport, hoping to see its business take off again. It's 
betting that tourists and trade with Asia will be the salvation. 
German federal state Rhineland-Palatinate announced Monday that it had sold its majority stake in of Frankfurt's 
Hahn Airport to Shanghai Yigian Trading Company (SYT), in a deal worth somewhere in the "low double-digit 
million euro range." According to Reuters, SYT counts as one of the leading construction companies in China. 
Roger Lewentz, Rhineland-Palatinate's interior minister, expressed hope that SYTwill give the aiprort an "extra 
push" to develop. Primarily used by discount airlines, especially Ireland-based Ryanair, Frankfurt Hahn has suffered 
through years of financial turbulence. It ended the 2014 fiscal year 45 million euros ($51 million) in the red. Another 
loss of 16 million euros is expected this year. While not offering any timeline for crawling back in the black, SYT 
announced on Monday its plan for revitalizing the airport, largely by increasing its business with Asia. Hoping to 
draw Asian tourists, SYT's chief representative Zu Tao Chou announced that the company was in talks with 
Chinese airline Yangtze River Express over its return to Frankfurt Hahn. The airline stopped operating at the airport 
in 2015, striking a blow to its business. SYT also aims to build the airport into a hub for freight deliveries. "We 
expect good business in cargo deliveries of food to Asia," Chou said. Local-foreign partnership Rhineland-
Palatinate had an 82.5 percent share in the airport's ownership. It will still maintain an involvement, including 
through subsidies and investment aid. Lewentz calculated that the Hahn will receive as much as 70 million euros in 
tax money between now and 2024. "The support shows the high-priority the state government will ascribe to the 
site in the future," Lewentz said. According to the agreement though, SYT will have to supply at least half of the 
investments. Rhineland-Palatinate president Malu Dreyer is confident "that the buyer will commit itself to the future 
of the location." SYT supported that sentiment, rather romantically. Chou said Monday that he "lost his heart" to the 
airport. Sealing the deal The state's legislative assembly still has to approve the sale in a vote expected before the 
body's summer recess. The European Commission also has to approve the state's continued involvement in the 
airport's operation. The airport is located about 120 kilometers (75 miles) away from Frankfurt am Main. Originally it 
served as a US military airbase before being converted to commercial use in 1993. Fraport, which operates the 
international flight hub Frankfurt Airport, sold its share to Rhineland-Palatinate in 2009 for a single euro. The 
German state of Hessen, where Frankfurt am Main is located, owns the remaining shares of the airport, about 17 
percent. It is already in the "home stretch" of negotiations with SYT about a buyout, which could take place within 
the coming weeks. jtm/uhe (AFP, dpa, Reuers)

Jun 02, 2016( BusinessPundit: http://www.businesspundit.com/ Delivered by Newstex) European airline Ryanair is 
cutting some of its checked baggage fees by up to 50% just in time for the busy summer travel season. The low-
cost carrier has a unique approach to checked baggage. The airline calculates its checked baggage fees on 
luggage weight and flight duration. 
On Thursday, the airline announced that it's cutting some fees[1] by up to half. Checking a bag that weighs less 
than 34 pounds for a domestic flight shorter than two hours will now cost €15 ($17), down from €30 ($33). A heavier 
bag on the same flight length will cost 38% less at €25 ($28). Lighter bags on trips under three hours will now cost 
€25 (roughly $28)— a 17% price reduction. There are no checked baggage fee discounts on flights longer than 
three hours. Checked baggage fees are a major profit point for airlines. However, Ryanair recently admitted that it 
needs to lower its fees as many potential passengers fear increased terrorist attacks in and around many of the 
regions where the airline operates. Ryanair says 92% of its travelers will experience savings based on its discounts 
for checked baggage. The airline recently announced its travel increased 12% from a year ago to 10.6 million 
customers in May.European Travel[2]ryanair[3]travel[4] http://www.businesspundit.com/author/john-howard/John

Jun 01, 2016( Market Folly: http://www.marketfolly.com Delivered by Newstex) We're posting notes from the 
London Value Investor Conference 2016[1]. Next up is Jonathan Mills of Metropolis Capital who pitched long 
Ryanair. Jonathan Mills' London Value Investor Conference PresentationInvestment idea: Ryanair Ryanair is the 
fourth largest airline by market cap and the largest in Europe. 
It has greater coverage than any other airline in Europe. The CEO, Michael O'Leary, is an 'owner occupier' with a 
stake in the company worth over Euro 600m.Ryanair has the lowest short haul fares in the industry by a significant 
amount yet surprisingly has the highest margins. It has done this by having the lowest costs and by being very 
efficient. It has the lowest route charges, it does not spend as much on sales and marketing as its competitors and 
it pays less for its planes. Ryanair work their people harder and there are no unions. Ryanair employees work 
longer hours and receive incentive based pay.Customer behaviour has been changed to reduce costs further. 
Being the first to introduce charging for check-in bags resulted in faster check-ins, fewer desks and less fuel. Ten 
year CAGR +15%. They are planning to double passenger numbers by 2024. There is plenty of room to gain 
market share in Europe with current share at 13%. Ryanair is generating more cash than it needs to fund its 
growth.What are the dangers to the business? Load factors could decline. Oil prices are rebounding. Labour law 
changes could increase costs. Terrorism or a plane crash could reduce demand. Mills thinks the biggest risk is that 
O'Leary exits the business.Ryanair is the Amazon of the airline industry. It is the largest and lowest cost producer - 
but with the highest margins. It has excellent capital allocation with large share buybacks and dividends and a 
balance sheet with net cash. It trades on a forward multiple of 11x. Be sure to check out the rest of the 
presentations from the London Value Investor Conference[2]. [ 1]: http://www.marketfolly.com/2016/06/london-

19:37.COMMENTARY: 'Put money in thy purse.' - Othello, Act I, Scene III. 
The low-cost Irish airline is playing the role of victim. Using language in their press release that is reminiscent of a 
soliloquy from a Shakespearean tragedy (or comedy), Ryanair is complaining about the consequences of what it 
terms is 'an environmentally-unfriendly tax' on tickets. According to David O'Brien, Ryanair's Chief Commercial 
Officer, it 'unfairly penalises passengers on efficient, green, airlines such as Ryanair in favour of passengers on 
high fare, half empty, gas guzzling airlines, and destroys the cost competitiveness of privately owned Oslo Rygge 
Airport in favour of the state-owned Avinor monopoly.' 'This tax will severely damage Norwegian tourism, 
particularly around regional airports. The Norwegian Government has instantly made Norway uncompetitive and 
less attractive to airlines and tourists,' he says in a statement. Ryanair announced today that it will be 'forced to 
close' its base at eastern Norway's Moss Rygge Airport from 29th October this year. Remaining operations will be 
moved to Torp, and thrice-daily Oslo Gardermoen-London Stanstead flights will commence one day later. Vilnius 
will be graced by the airline's aircraft once a day from the same Norway airport. Today's performance by Ryanair 
brought the final curtain down on a relatively long-running affair. Norway's Centre-Right government has been firm 
in its resolve to introduce an extra passenger tax - despite noises from Ryanair. Last year, Rygge director Pål 
Tandberg warned that introducing it could mean the death of the airport. Several airlines, including Widerøe, 
Norwegian, and Ryanair, announced route revisions as a result of the new tax which takes effect today - Norway's 
Ministry of Finance says it is a fiscal, not environmental tax. Rygge's executive board has announced that the 
civilian part of the airport is to close from 1st November. A two-thirds traffic volume loss meant that the facility was 
no longer commercially viable. Ryanair has cancelled 16 of its routes from there and moved eight to Torp. While the 
base closure is a sad fact for the some 1,000 who will lose their jobs, Ryanair has based just four of its aircraft at 
Rygge. The rest are stationed at other airports in Europe, and some of these will serve the Norwegian market from 
30th October. These European airports are ones which give Ryanair a higher yield. The passenger tax row, which 
is over as much as 88 kroner (including VAT) per ticket, is also about administrative costs and refunds. People 
travelling on domestic flights in Norway and then onward on international ones would have already paid this sum. 
Ryanair would either have to prove the passenger has done this in order to be exempt from collecting it once more, 
or refunding them this amount. Return travel from a country without a passenger tax would not be subject to the 
Norwegian one. And as the new tax applies to all airports in Norway, Ryanair's repositioning move seems rather a 
All the world's a stage to Ryanair
moot point. Nobody, not even the government of Norway, is 'forcing' Ryanair to do anything. Ryanair is choosing to 
reduce its Norwegian traffic by 50 per cent. Moreover, the loss of 1,000 jobs, 900,000 passengers per annum 
(airline figures), and a closed airport is ideal leverage, which the airline has used for all it is worth. 'Sadly, the 
Norwegian Government has chosen to sacrifice 1,000 jobs at Oslo Rygge for reasons which defy explanation. This 
is a black day for Oslo Rygge, for Norway and for Norwegian tourism,'declares Ryanair's David O'Brien. 
Lamentably, the matter for Ryanair is more about being in the black. 'All the world's a stage, and all the men and 
women merely players: They have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts.' - As 
You Like It, Act II, Scene VII. 'Rude am I in my speech, and little blessed with the soft phrase of peace.' - Othello, 
Act I, Scene III.Published on Wednesday, 1st June[5], 2016[6] at 18:37 under the columns[7] category, by Michael

Jun 01, 2016( Taxgirl: http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/#64dc47d03dba Delivered by Newstex) A logo on 
a Ryanair media flight from Dublin to Gatwick Airport, London and back to Dublin on Tuesday, April 12, 2016. (AP 
Photo/Shawn Pogatchnik) Ryanair, the low cost, big number European airline headquartered out of Dublin, Ireland, 
has announced[1] that it will close its Oslo Rygge base in southern Norway as of October 2016. The decision was 
made after the Norwegian Government confirmed an NOK80 ($9.61) Air Transportation Tax, plus Norwegian VAT, 
on departing domestic and international[2] passengers. As a result of the new tax and subsequent closure, the 
airline will cancel 16 routes from Oslo Rygge (Beziers, Brussels, Chania, Dublin, Edinburgh, Malaga, Palma, 
Poznan, Pula, Riga, Rzeszow, Thessaloniki, Szczecin, Tallinn, Wroclaw, and Zadar) and move 4 aircraft ...anair 
jobs out of Norway to other Ryanair bases. The combined moves will reduce the airline's Norwegian traffic by 50% 
(approximately 900,000 passengers). The new departure tax will, according to Ryanair, have a devastating impact 
on Norwegian air travel and tourism. 
The airline had previously urged the Norwegian Government to ditch the per seat per flight tax. The Norwegian 
government, however, hopes to raise approximately NOK1 billion ($119,965,220 U.S.) from the new tax in 2016. 
The International Air Transport Association (IATA), the trade association for the world's airlines, representing some 
260 airlines or 83% of total air traffic, opposes the tax. In December of 2015, IATA sent a letter detailing its 
concerns about the consequences of the tax, including reductions in travel and service, to Siv Jensen, Norwegian 
Minister of Finance. You can read the letter here[3] (downloads as a pdf). Nonetheless, Norway pressed on with the 
tax. Ryanair's Chief Commercial Officer, David O'Brien said about the move, 'The illogical decision of the 
Norwegian Government to introduce a flat rate environmentally unfriendly tax unfairly penalises passengers on 
efficient, green, airlines such as Ryanair in favour of passengers on high fare, half empty, gas guzzling airlines, and 
destroys the cost competitiveness of privately owned Oslo Rygge Airport in favour of the state-owned Avinor 
monopoly. As a result, Ryanair has no choice but to close its Oslo Rygge base which will result in our Norwegian 
traffic being cut in half.' O'Brien called the announcement a 'black day for Oslo Rygge, for Norway, and for 
Norwegian tourism.' O'Brien said, 'This tax will severely damage Norwegian tourism, particularly around regional 
airports. The Norwegian Government has instantly made Norway uncompetitive and less attractive to airlines and 
tourists.' The airline isn't saying the closure is a completely done deal, with O'Brien remarking[4], 'It's all about the 
tax. Cut the tax this week and we'll reverse the plan.' [ 1]: http://corporate.ryanair.com/news/news/160601-oslo-

ILA Berlin Air Show takes off amid favorable biz climate

May 31, 2016( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex) One of Europe's most 
important aviation and aerospace trade fairs, the ILA Berlin Air Show, kicks off Wednesday near the German 
capital. Exhibitors have only four days to strike deals, two days fewer than usually. 
Berlin's ILA Air Show is the third most important trade fair in the aviation sector behind La Bourget in France and 
Farnborough in Britain. While it's not as big as its top rivals, the Berlin show has the distinction of being the oldest of 
its kind globally. It was first held in 1909, when there were no airplanes to see, but visitors were able to marvel at 
dirigible balloons - one of which had only just crossed the English Channel. Back then, the first show lasted a full 
100 days. In 2016, by contrast, exhibitors from around the globe only have four days to accomplish whatever 
they've come here for. The business environment for this year's ILA looks propitious. Air traffic is growing globally. 
Recent estimates project that the number of civil flights will double to 7 billion over the next twenty years, up from 
3.5 billion in 2015. Aircraft fleets are expanding to meet growing demand, particularly in Asia. But even in Europe, 
leading budget carriers such as Ryanair and Easyjet have been modernizing and expanding their passenger aircraft 
fleets. Low fuel prices are another reason for the industry to look to the future with confidence. For aircraft makers, 
that's leading to full order books. Given exuberant growth prospects, industry insiders don't seem too worried by the 
fact that the two giants in the sector, Boeing and Airbus, have both seen their bottom-line profit drop recently. 
Lucrative deals are almost certain for the two behemoths at ILA 2016, at least in the civil aviation segment. Sluggish 
military aircraft business The weaponized aircraft segment should prove more of a problem, as the two biggest 
aircraft makers are still grappling with legacy issues. Europe's Airbus has encountered materials problems in its 
A400M jet engines, while its rival across the Atlantic has seen development costs for its KC-46 aerial refueling and 
strategic military transport aircraft spiral out of control. The European Space Agency (ESA) is also a regular at the 
ILA show. This year, it'll be providing an overview of its current research programs. Among other things, ESA is 
taking part in the US-led Orion project aimed at revitalizing manned spaceflight endeavors. Experts are working on 
more trips to the Moon and beyond. By contrast, Germany's aeronautics and space research center (DLR) is not 
ashamed of looking backward in time, rather than forward. Using a wind tunnel, scientists have put to the test a 
replica of one of aviation pioneer Otto Lilienthal's gliders, designed more than a century ago. At the air show in 
Berlin, they're demonstrating to visitors what must have caused Lilienthal to crash-land on August 9, 1896, incurring 
injuries of which he died a day later. hg/nz (dpa, Reuters)

Chicago, IL - May 26, 2016 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the 
Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. 
Stocks recently featured in the blog include Southwest Airlines (LUV[1]), Alaska Air Group (ALK[2]), Ryanair 
Holdings plc ( RYAAY[3]), Delta Air Lines (DAL[4]) and American Airlines Group (AAL[5]). Today, Zacks is 
promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free[6]. Here are highlights from 
Wednesday's Analyst Blog: Airline Stock Roundup The past week saw the Dallas-based carrier Southwest Airlines 
(LUV[7]) announce two shareholder friendly moves - a dividend hike and a new share repurchase program. 
However, the recent crash of the EgyptAir jet into the Mediterranean Sea, claiming 66 lives, has been dominating 
headlines. Furthermore, the employment data released by Bureau of Transportation Statistics for passenger airlines 
showed a substantial year-over-year increase in full-time equivalent (FTE) employment for March. Moreover, 
expansion related news from Alaska Air Group ( ALK[8]) grabbed headlines in the past week. On the earnings front, 
European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY[9]) reported healthy results in fiscal 2016 (ended Mar 31, 
2016), on the back of increased revenues and low costs. (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for May 18, 2016 
[10] ). Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Close on the heels of Delta Air Lines' (DAL[11]) decision 
to hike its quarterly dividend payout, Southwest Airlines announced a dividend raise along with a new share 
repurchase program worth $2 billion. The low-cost carrier raised its cash quarterly dividend to $0.10 per share 
($0.40 per share annualized), representing an increase of 33.33% over the previous quarterly payout (read more: 
Southwest Airlines Up on Dividend Hike ...w Buyback Plan [12] ). 2. Investigations are underway to determine the 
cause of the crash of the EgyptAir jet which was travelling from Paris to Cairo. According to a Bloomberg report, 
Egypt's aviation minister Sherif Fathy had cited terrorism as a probable cause behind the tragedy. Although it has 
not yet been proved conclusively that the flight was a victim to a terror act, we believe that in the event of it being 
proved so, travel to Europe will take a hit (read more: US Carriers Sell Off in Wake of EgyptAir Tragedy [13] ). 3. 
Alaska Airlines, the wholly owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group, announced the addition of a three-times-a-day 
nonstop service connecting San Diego to Sacramento and Burbank to San Jose. The new service is set to 
commence on Mar 16, 2017 (read more: Alaska Airlines Eyes Route Expansion, California in Focus [14] ). 4. 
According to data released by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, there was a 3.9% increase in the number of 
workers employed by U.S. scheduled passenger airlines for March. This marked the 28th consecutive month of 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Southwest Airlines , Alaska Air Group, Ryanair Holdings , Delta Air Lines 
and American Airlines Group
year-over-year increase. FTEs for Mar 2016 came in at 406,113. According to the update, the most number of FTEs 
in the month were employed by the American Airlines Group (AAL[15]) among the network airlines. Southwest 
Airlines secured the top spot in this regard in the low-cost carrier category. 5. Ryanair Holdings reported robust 
financial and operating numbers with net profit for fiscal 2016 up 43% year over year at €1,242 million. Moreover, 
load factor increased 500 basis points to 93%. The top line expanded 16% to €6,536 million on the back of an 18% 
rise in passenger count to 106.4 million. The customer friendly 'Always Getting Better (AGB)' program drew 
massive number of new customers to Ryanair. However, the carrier issued a 'cautious' outlook for fiscal 2017 in the 
wake of the recent terror attacks. The carrier expects airfares to face pressure due to concerns which could hurt 
travel demand in Europe. That the carrier's fears are not baseless is reflected by the update coming from travel 
company, Thomas Cook. The agency has revealed a 5% decline in summer bookings compared to last year. With 
average fares expected to decline approximately 7%, net profit for fiscal 2017 is expected to increase only 13%. 
The company plans to fly 116 million passengers in fiscal 2017, reflecting an increase of 9%. Want the latest

fiscal 2017 in the wake of the recent terror attacks. The carrier expects airfares to face pressure due to concerns 
which could hurt travel demand in Europe. That the carrier's fears are not baseless is reflected by the update 
coming from travel company, Thomas Cook. The agency has revealed a 5% decline in summer bookings compared 
to last year. With average fares expected to decline approximately 7%, net profit for fiscal 2017 is expected to 
increase only 13%. The company plans to fly 116 million passengers in fiscal 2017, reflecting an increase of 
9%.Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and

May 23, 2016( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex) Budget carrier Ryanair 
has booked record bottom-line earnings for its fiscal year ended March 2016. Its outlook is still optimistic, but lower 
ticket prices are likely to see the surge in net profit slow down. 
Europe's biggest budget carrier by passengers, Ryanair, on Monday reported a 43-percent surge in net profit for its 
fiscal year to March 2016. The Irish airline said its bottom-line earnings amounted to 1.24 billion euros ($1.39 
billion), just short of a forecast of 1.25 billion euros seen in a company poll of analysts' estimates. The good result 
was attributable to low fuel prices, the company said, adding that the 1.24 billion euros in profit did not include the 
money earned through the sale of its stake in Aer Lingus. Cautious outlook Ryanair's revenue was also up 
markedly as the carrier reported a 16-percent increase in turnover for the full year to total 6.5 billion euros. CEO 
Michael O'Leary indicated the company was planning to cut ticket fares by 7 percent on average this fiscal year with 
a view to bolstering its market share as intensifying competition hit Europe's airline business. He added Ryanair 
cautiously expected net profit to increase by approximately 13 percent in the year to March 2017 to between 1.38 
billion and 1.43 billion euros. hg/jd (Reuters, dpa)

May 20, 2016( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) RyanairVote 
Leave has lodged a complaint with the police about a Ryanair promotion that the pro-Brexit campaign claims is in 
breach of bribery laws, according to The Guardian. Ryanair's "Brexit Special" promotion offers British expats the 
chance to fly back to the UK on the day or the day before the referendum, June 23, for a discount price, starting at 
€19.99. "This appears to be corrupt, since the company is offering discounts on the commercial rate to customers 
with the sole aim of ensuring that they vote and vote to remain in the European Union," Dominic Cummings, 
campaign director of Vote Leave said in a statement. 
Scotland Yard told The Guardian that it had received the complaint and that it was in the process of considering a 
response. However, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary called the complaint "desperate" and Ryanair is extending the 
offer for another 24 hours. The "Fly Home to Vote Remain" is open until midnight tonight[1]. O'Leary said in a 
statement sent to Business Insider: "Ryanair's Fly Home to Vote Remain seat sale, which allows UK citizens to buy 
a €19.99 one way fare to fly to the UK on 22 and 23 June next, fully complies with Ryanair's policy of lowering the 
cost of air travel to/from the UK. Vote Leave must be getting really desperate if they are now objecting to low fare 
air travel for British citizens." Scotland Yard was not immediately available for comment.NOW WATCH: Humans

May 20, 2016( New Europe: http://neurope.eu Delivered by Newstex) Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share 
on Google+ Share on LinkedInAfter recent endorsement from the US and Canada, the anti-Brexit campaign adds 
European low cost company Ryanair. The Irish company launched a 'Brexit Special' offer. 
The company will offer flights to the UK from just €19.99 (£15.49) on Wednesday 22 June and Thursday 23 June to 
allow British living abroad to flight to the UK and vote. The vote of the British expats was long considered an 
unresolved issue, but Ryanair offer may change the situation. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary wasn't always very 
enthusiastic about the EU, as in 2011 EU blocked their acquisition of Aer Lingus on antitrust grounds, and O'Leary 
compared the EU with Star Wars' Evil Empire. However, the British market is Ryanair's main one, with flights to 
holiday destinations and also with all flight to Eastern Europe for workers in the UK. Roughly a third of Ryanair's 
flights ends in the UK. Ryanair's Chief Marketing Officer, Kenny Jacobs, officially stated the company line behind 
the move and said: 'As the UK's largest airline, Ryanair is absolutely clear that the UK economy and its future 
growth prospects are stronger as a member of the European Union than they are outside of the EU and with just 5 
weeks to go, we will continue to work hard to help deliver a resounding 'Remain' vote on 23 June.' However, the 
proposal sparkled some controversy. The Leave campaign denounced to British police the promotion, as it 
allegedly breaches bribery laws. According to Vote Leave campaign director Dominic Cummings 'the company is 
offering discounts on the commercial rate to customers with the sole aim of ensuring that they vote and vote to

May 19, 2016( Slugger O'Toole: http://www.sluggerotoole.com/ Delivered by Newstex) So far it's fair to say that EU 
referendum debate hasn't inspired many. Both sides have often been accused of 'scaremongering' over the 
potential impacts on everything from immigration to border controls and increased terror threats to the price of a 
nice bottle of wine. Meanwhile many of us across the UK and Ireland have our minds fixed on another great 
European project, the European Football Championship. 
The unbridled optimism of plucky fans and the motto 'Dare to dream' seem a long way from what's often labelled 
'Project Fear'. Although I almost always want to keep politics and sport separate, examining how the two might be 
related is worth looking at. To many the EU isn't very good at laying-out grand visions or dreams but its strength lies 
in making life easier for ordinary people going-about their ordinary business. Of course, no-one can ever suggest 
that EU membership was in some way responsible for Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland or any other team, 
qualifying for this summer's tournament in France. There have been 10 tournaments since the UK joined in which 
Northern Ireland have failed to qualify. There is no correlation between being in the EU and international footballing 
success, as any die-hard Luxembourg fan will tell you. However, if you're one of the thousands of fans travelling to 
see any of the games who will also have to vote on EU membership in the middle of the tournament, it's worth 
considering if the EU has made getting there easier as a travelling supporter. 1.Getting in: You can certainly get to 
France without a visa if you travel from the UK and Ireland, but you will need a passport. It's of course unclear 
whether or not that would change if the UK left, new agreements would need to be struck. Football fans travelling 
from the UK to Brazil for the 2014 world cup didn't face many restrictions either, but wait and see how difficult it'll be 
at the World Cup in Russia in 2018! 2.Getting there cheaper: There's no doubt about it, the EU has resulted in 
cheaper flights. The EU Open-Skies Treaty of 1992 blew the lid off the system that had restricted national air-space 
from competition to 'flag-carriers' and since then Ryanair, Easyjet and others have brought European integration of 
one kind of another to many corners of Europe. Airlines now fly where they wish in the EU without government 
approval. The EU has also increased passenger safety standards and guaranteed your rights if your flight is 
cancelled or delayed too long. There are also measures in place to ensure safer travel by ferry and rail. 3.Getting 
your Match tickets Given the sponsorship of the tournament by Visa card all 800,000 Euro 2016 tickets have to be 
bought using a credit card. The EU's single area payment area has meant that these are all guaranteed, anywhere 
in the EU (or indeed some participating states outside the EU). 4.Getting somewhere to stay The EU has also made 
hotels safer as a directive passed back on 1986 defines minimum safety standards in hotels and serves as a basis 
for common safety rules throughout the EU. 5.Getting things while you're there Thanks to the free movement of 
goods, you can bring or bring back pretty much anything you want from France, so no excuses for fans not bringing 
EU referendum Euro 2016
back presents for their Mums! Obviously some restrictions and rules apply[1] for dodgy stuff. 6.Getting help when 
you're over there You can always call the British embassy or consulate for certain kinds of assistance when 
travelling but the EU has made things easier to get help when abroad. If you have a European Health Insurance 
Card[2] you can now get access to free medical treatment while you're in France. 7.Calling home While the mobile 
phones will undoubtedly be used to take plenty of selfies (some unionist politicians in the crowd are probably 
thinking about their next election) some fans will probably want to use them to make some calls. The EU has since 
2007 been trying to bring down the costs of using your phone when abroad. One of the undoubted benefits of EU 
membership has been that constant reduction of roaming costs when travelling abroad. To place a call inside the 
EU is currently no more than €0.05 per minute, as of June 2017 it will be abolished altogether. Will all these go if we 
vote to leave? It's not certain, new agreements would have to be written and enforced. The travel agent body ABTA 
concluded that[3]'The UK travelling consumer could be faced with increased costs if an exit vote led to a sustained 
deterioration in the value of sterling, making foreign currency destinations more expensive in sterling. Consumers 
would also need to cover any additional health insurance costs, should the UK exit the European Health Insurance 
Card scheme.'I sometimes wonder if David Cameron deliberately chose to hold the referendum on 23 June as it's 
slap-bang in the middle of the tournament, but a day when there are no matches to be played so as to distract the 
voting public. The argument continue over whether the EU, NATO or the US has kept the peace in Europe since 
1945, No-one can easily argue that it was the EU alone. But one thing is for sure the EU has made the peace more 
profitable and easier for the consumer and the holidaymaker, and the travelling football fan whichever ever team 
they're 
following.Related

May 18, 2016( The Foreigner: http://theforeigner.no Delivered by Newstex) Irish airline Ryanair continues its 
political support for Britain's continued EU membership. The carrier's 'Fly Home to Vote Remain' campaign sees 
cheap seats to the UK for travel on 22nd and 23rd June (the Referendum's Polling Day). According to the airline, it 
is 'to help the more than 1.2m Brits living abroad fly back to vote 'Remain'.' It is primarily aimed at UK citizens. 
However, Hans Joergen Elnaes, Sales ...rketing Manager Scandinavia ...ltic tells The Foreigner that anyone can 
benefit from these low fares to all UK airports. Ryanair[1] is actively campaigning for a 'Remain' vote. They argue 
that this is because it will lead to more UK jobs and better economic growth, that the EU Open Skies [Agreement] 
has transformed UK tourism and job creation prospects, and that the free movement of goods and services has 
made the UK one of Europe's most competitive and best performing economies. 'Leaving Europe won't save the 
UK money or red tape because like Norway the UK will still have to contribute to Europe, and obey its rules if it 
wants to continue to trade freely with Europe, so it's clear that UK voters should vote Yes to Europe and Yes to the 
reformed Europe,' Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary[2] said in a statement. Last week, both Bank of England Governor 
Mark Carney and Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), warned of the 
risk of recession should Britain vote to leave the EU. Conservative politician Iain Duncan Smith, leader of the Brexit 
campaign, subsequently suggested that fellow Party member George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, 
might have co-ordinated the back-to-back release of both financial heavyweights' reports. Mr Duncan Smith 
challenged Mr Osborne to reveal both phone call logs and emails between Bank of England and Treasury officials 
prior to its assessment, reported Michael Savage, Chief Political correspondent at The Times. 'Is it a surprise 
suddenly on Thursday then followed by Friday you have two reports coming out? Do you think they told each other 
or talked to each other about what they were doing? I wonder about that,' told BBC One's Sunday Politics 
programme. [ 1]: http://theforeigner.no/pages/news/ryanair-drops-allocated-oslo-routes/ [ 2]:

View original post here[2]. Submitted by GoldCore. Michael O'Leary was forthright, opinionated and humorous as 
ever today at a Bloomberg News conference where he warned that Brexit could lead to contagion. The CEO of one 
of Europe's largest airlines said that the airline would be unlikely to diversify into gold, as it is in his eyes a 'risky 
asset.'Ryanair CEO, Michael O'Leary handed copy of 'New Case For Gold' In response to a question, put to him by 
Research Director of GoldCore, Mark O'Byrne:'Given event risks and risk of contagion posed by BREXIT and the 
advent of negative interest rates and threat of bail-ins, will Ryanair follow the lead of the world's largest insurer, 
Munich Re and diversify some of their cash reserves into gold[3]?'Ryanair CEO O'Leary said that he would leave 
that to greater minds than his - referring to his treasury executives. 
But he said that his own view was that Ryanair would not diversify their cash reserves into gold as he did not like 
sitting on cash or indeed diversifying into other 'risky assets.' He said he preferred to use cash on balance sheet for 
productive purposes like 'buying planes.' After the event, Mark gifted Michael a copy of Jim Rickards latest best 
selling book, 'The New Case For Gold'[4] so that Michael would have a better understanding of gold's renewed 
importance as a safe haven asset[5] and a hedge against negative interest rates, currency debasement, deposit 
bail-ins[6] and indeed cyber hacking and fraud.Michael O'Leary of Ryanair Michael graciously accepted the book 
but whether he reads or not is another story. As one wag quipped he will 'probably throw the book at a cyclist when 
he is driving home today!' O'Leary is a breath of fresh air in terms of not being politically correct, speaking his 
mind and calling it how he sees it. Some see that as divisive, others as honest. Like him or dislike him, he is always 
interesting and has something interesting to say. He was the highlight of what would have been a fairly hum drum 
event even given the fact that the Irish Prime Minister, An Taoiseach, Enda Kenny gave the opening address. He 
warned of the severe consequences of BREXIT[7]. O'Leary has said Britain leaving the EU is 'far too serious for 
politicians to make spurious arguments' and that if the UK left it would end up like Norway where it would have to 
implement EU legislation but would have no say in the issues. He disputed arguments by those who said Britain 
could remain in the free trade area without implementing EU rules and said Britain could 'not afford to stay outside 
the single market.' He said a vote for BREXIT could lead to contagion in the EU as other states seek to leave. He 
said it would create a lot of uncertainty in the short term for markets and the UK economy but that the UK economy 
might do well in the long term from BREXIT. One of the most interesting questions posed to the attendees - some 
100 of them - was whether the UK would vote for BREXIT. The vast majority said that they would not and only a 
handful of attendees - including Michael O'Leary and I - said that UK would vote for BREXIT. Markets and bookies 
were wrong about the Nice and Lisbon referendums in Ireland and I believe they will be wrong re BREXIT as well. 
Ryanair CEO On BREXIT, Contagion, The EU and Gold
They are completely underestimating the degree of anger among voters and deep concern about the 'democratic 
deficit' at the heart of the EU both in the UK and now throughout the EU. This is evidenced in the rise of Trump and 
Sanders and of popular parties of the left and right throughout the world. A few shorts weeks ago, Trump was given 
little chance to win the Republican nomination. O'Leary articulated it very well when he said how he was very pro 
EU and pro the single market and all the benefits that it brings in terms of free markets, freedom to trade and the 
free movement of people and capital. However, he warned about the rise of the 'EU Super State' and the lack of 
democracy in the EU with the bureaucrats in Brussels not listening to the wishes of the people. This is what 
concerns people in all European countries he said. Immigration is a distraction and is not the primary reason for 
many people being increasingly concerned about the EU project. For a small minority yes but not for the majority of 
voters in the UK or elsewhere. Stephen Flood, CEO of GoldCore concurs:'Europe is heading towards a federal 
republic without any meaningful dialogue as to what this would mean for state sovereignty. The project means that 
the people of Europe are been threatened with the removal of economic supports and trade agreements unless 
they acquiesce to this super state. Many British people have become aware of this threat and the increasing 
changes in their governance and legal system. They rightly express discontent at this progression and demand a 
debate as to where Europe is going. The European debt crisis has bot been resolved and the behaviour of the ECB 
towards debtor countries has broken with every capital market norm since the dawn of time. Political decisions were 
made by a non elected body to the detriment of smaller countries, i.e. Ireland and Greece. The ECB and 
Commission have broken the social pact for its own political, economic and monetary purposes and 
gains.'O'Leary's view on gold is the typical group think, herd view of gold as 'risky asset' prevalent among most of 
the Irish and British population where there is little understanding of gold as a safe haven asset and as financial 
insurance. This is due to a lack of a culture or tradition of owning gold and a complete lack of coverage and analysis 
of the gold market. This is in marked contrast to the Germans, Austrians, Swiss and most Asian nations who 
understand gold as a store of value. This is changing in Ireland and the UK but slowly as there is still a significant 
focus on stocks, bonds, deposits and especially property. In Ireland especially, we love our property and have 
weekly property supplements which are 20 page plus and are getting as big and frothy as the property supplements 
we had prior to the last property crash. We sincerely hope for his financial well being and that of his company, that 
the Ryanair CEO reads the book and subsequently diversifies into gold - both personally and with Ryanair itself. I 
believe that Jim Rickards would gladly meet with his team to discuss the importance of proper diversification of the 
Ryanair cash reserves. We are happy to send copies of the book and our extensive research on gold as a safe 
haven[8] 
to 
Michael 
and 
his 
Treasury 
team.

Britain 's Osborne Turns Fire on 'Out' Plan to Leave EU Single Market
Britain's Osborne Turns Fire on 'Out' Plan to Leave EU Single Market

May 16, 2016( Voice of America: http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex)  Finance minister George 
Osborne attacked pro-Brexit campaigners for saying Britain should not just leave the European Union but also its 
single market, as he sought to convince voters that the economy faces big risks in next month's referendum. 
Osborne said Britain would lose 200 billion pounds ($287 billion) a year in trade in 15 years' time and miss out on 
the same amount in foreign investment, if it fell back on World Trade Organization rules to govern its ties with the 
EU after a Brexit. 
"Leaving the EU is a one-way ticket to a poorer Britain," Osborne told media in an aircraft hangar at Stansted 
Airport, northeast of London, where the head of airline Ryanair said his firm could lower investment after an "Out" 
vote. Opinion polls have shown that voters tend to think that staying in the EU would be better for Britain's economy 
but they also remain almost evenly split between those who want to stay in the bloc and those who want to leave. 
As part of a relentless series of warnings about the economic risks of Brexit, Osborne's finance ministry is due to 
publish a report on the short-term impact of an "Out" vote soon. A leading supporter of the "Vote Leave" campaign, 
justice minister Michael Gove said earlier this month that Britain should also leave the single market after a Brexit. If 
a post-Brexit Britain wanted to remain part of the single market, it would probably face demands from the rest of the 
bloc to keep its borders open to EU workers and to continue paying into the EU's budget, just as Norway and 
Switzerland do. The "Out" campaign has put stopping high levels of immigration and Britain's contributions to the 
EU budget at the center of their message to voters. Osborne spoke on Monday alongside former Labour Party 
economics spokesman Ed Balls, who was long a critic of Osborne, and former business minister Vince Cable, a 
senior member of the opposition Liberal Democrat party. Balls and Cable both said Britain risked economic damage 
if it left the EU. Osborne also accused the "Out" campaign of resorting to conspiracy theories ahead of the 
referendum for calling into question the motives of global bodies such as the International Monetary Fund and the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development when they spoke of the economic risks of Brexit. "The 
economic argument is beyond doubt. It's not a conspiracy, it's called a consensus," Osborne said.

May 11, 2016( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) Evan Agostini / AP 
ImagesBlackJet — a startup which aimed to be like Uber but for on-demand private jets — ceased operations last 
Thursday. The company was backed by celebrities including Ashton Kutcher, Will Smith, and Jay Z's company Roc 
Nation, as well as tech execs such as Salesforce's Mark Benioff. It was even originally supported by Uber 
cofounder Garrett Camp. 
So what went wrong? We spoke to Clive Jackson — CEO and founder of Victor, which claims to be the world's 
fastest-growing on-demand private jet charter compan and has raised more than $24 million investment to date — 
to get his perspective. Jackson explained that BlackJet, which sold seats on a shuttle service was "intrinsically ... at 
odds with those that traditionally fly private." Rather than allowing flyers to charter jets on-demand like Victor, 
BlackJet required an annual fee, giving members access to a network of jets on which they could book seats on 
pre-determined routes. Jackson said that "Uber for airplane" operators who try to operate shuttle services should 
"really go and talk to O'Leary [CEO of Ryanair] or Stelios [owner of EasyJet] about how to do shuttle. Intrinsically, 
they are not flying small planes, they are flying larger planes with more seats." Speaking about celebrity investors in 
BlackJet and the wider industry, Jackson had this advice: "I think anyone that is looking to invest in this sector has 
to do proper due diligence. Typically, angel-style investors tend not to do that, or do it very well at all. My advice to 
anyone looking to invest in this sector is: don't take verbatim what you are being told ... Do go out there and 
undertake some proper due diligence." BlackJet CEO Dean Rotchin cited investment problems for his 
company's ceasing of operations in an interview with Fortune:[1] 'We probably did more with less than anyone but 
it's a critical mass business," Rotchin said. "There's a reason why 'critical' is part of 'critical mass'.' Rotchin also 
blamed an article from TechCrunch[2] last month that inaccurately prematurely reported the company had shut 
down for accelerating the BlackJet's closure. TechCrunch later updated the story with a correction.NOW WATCH:

May 10, 2016( Branding Strategy Insider: http://www.brandingstrategyinsider.com Delivered by Newstex) When it 
comes to major marketing moves there is a clear and enduring hierarchy of pain. At the bottom of the hierarchy are 
the mundane, everyday tactical moves that cause barely a whimper of concern from even those strategically 
responsible: a change in distributor, a new spokesperson or the introduction of new segmentation. 
In the middle come more challenging marketing executions like changing ad agencies, implementing a CRM system 
or launching a new product. And then, at the very top, above all others, is the scariest prospect of them all - 
rebranding[1]. It's actually a catch-all concept for different approaches to brand change. Here are three. 1. In a pure 
rebranding[2] the company leadership decides to rename the brand and overhaul what it represents in the market - 
think Accenture (formerly Andersen Consulting). 2. In a repositioning[3] the name stays the same but what the 
brand stands for is radically changed - think Ryanair. 3. In a revitalization[4] a formerly successful position is 
reintroduced for a new era - think Burberry. Each of these individual strategies represents an enormous 
organizational challenge and a career-defining moment for those responsible. Think it through. This thought piece is

May 10, 2016( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) United Continental 
Holdings UAL[1], the holding company of United Airlines, posted a 1.9% decrease in revenue passenger miles 
(RPMs: a measure of air traffic) for Apr 2016 on a 0.9% reduction in consolidated capacity (measured in average 
seat miles or ASMs). Domestic traffic climbed 0.6% while the metric decreased 3% on the international front. 
Another important metric, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) declined 90 basis points on a year-over-year 
basis in April to 80.5% as traffic contraction was more than the decline in capacity. The company registered a 
completion factor of 98%, with 70.9% of its flights on schedule in April.At the end of the first four months of 2016, 
United Continental recorded RPMs of 62.94 billion (down 0.3% year over year) and ASMs of 78.6 billion (up 1.1% 
year over year). Load factor stood at 80.1% against 81.2% in the first four months of 2015. Moreover, onboard 
passengers for Apr 2016 fell 1.6% while the same for the first four months of 2016 increased 0.9%.The Chicago-
based carrier still expects consolidated passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a measure of unit 
revenue) to decline in the range of 6.5% to 8.5% in the second quarter. 
The strong U.S. dollar, lower fuel surcharges, reduced travel demand were some of the factors behind the declining 
PRASM.United Continental, like many other carriers, is benefiting from low fuel costs. The carrier expects average 
fuel price per gallon (including all cash-settled hedges) in the band of $1.39 to $1.44 per gallon for the second 
quarter of 2016.Zacks Rank ...y PicksUnited Continental carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in 
the airline space include SkyWest Inc. SKYW[2], GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. GOL[3] and Ryanair 
Holdings RYAAY[4]. While SkyWest sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), GOL Linhas and Ryanair carry a Zacks 
Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7

May 10, 2016( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) Low-cost carrier 
Southwest Airlines Co. LUV[1] announced strong traffic numbers for Apr 2016, with revenue passenger miles 
(RPMs: a measure of air traffic) improving 4.7% on a year-over-year basis to 10.4 billion. Available seat miles 
(ASMs: a measure of capacity), on the other hand, grew 4.3% to 12.4 billion.Another important metric - load factor 
(% of seats filled by passengers) - improved 30 basis points (bps) to 83.6% during the month as traffic growth 
outpaced capacity expansion. 
Interestingly, this marks the highest ever load factor recorded by the Dallas-based airline company in the month of 
April.In the first four months of 2016, Southwest Airlines generated RPMs of 38.8 billion (up 8.4% year over year) 
and ASMs of 47.7 billion (up 7.9%), leading to a total load factor of 81.3% (up 40 bps).Southwest Airlines continues 
to expect operating revenue per ASM (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) to increase modestly in the second 
quarter of 2016.The company reported encouraging first-quarter 2016 results, wherein both the top and bottom line 
surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Quarterly revenues were up 9.3% year over year to $4,826 million and 
above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,818 million. On a year-over-year basis, Passenger and Other revenues 
increased 5.3% and 101%, respectively, while Freight revenues dropped 4.5%.Zacks Rank ...y PicksSouthwest

May 04, 2016( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) Delta Air Lines Inc. 
DAL[1] posted impressive air traffic data in the month of April. Traffic - measured in revenue passenger miles 
(RPMs) - was 17.34 billion, up 2.7% from 16.89 billion recorded a year ago.On a year-over-year basis, consolidated 
capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) inched up 2.5% to 20.81 billion. 
Meanwhile, the load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers decreased by 10 basis points to 83.3%.At 
the end of the first four months of 2016, Delta generated RPMs of 65.05 billion (up 3.1% year over year) and ASMs 
of 78.95 billion (up 2.7% year over year). Load factor stood at 82.4% versus 82.1% recorded last April. Likewise, 
passenger count in the month grew 3.1% while that for the first four months of this year rose 4.3%.However, Delta 
witnessed a 4% drop in PRASM (passenger revenue per available seat mile) in the month mainly impacted by 
volatile foreign currency exchange rates. Moreover, soft passenger yields (average fare paid per mile, per 
passenger) from domestic markets affected the PRASM figure.The company's significant route expansion plans, 
introduction of ancillary products, fleet revamping and customer service enhancement bode well. Further, the 
company has been reaping considerable benefits from its joint ventures and code share agreements.Zacks Rank 
...ocks to ConsiderDelta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the same space include 
SkyWest Inc. SKYW[2], GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. GOL[3] and Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[4].

Ryanair Gets Friendlier, Considers Connections for Growth
Ryanair Gets Friendlier, Considers Connections for Growth
The Cranky Flier

Body
Apr 28, 2016( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex) Many Americans may not realize 
this, but Ryanair is easily the largest airline in Europe when ranking by number of passengers flown. The airline is 
massive and it's highly profitable. For that reason, it has grown like a weed with ease. But as opportunities to grow 
start to become tougher to find, the airline has had to change. 
It notably softened its persona a couple years back and continues to push forward on customer-friendly initiatives. 
Now it's also considering connecting flights. When Ryanair first came upon its model in the 1990s, the opportunities 
seemed endless. Unlike ultra low cost carriers in the US, Ryanair learned early that a reliable operation was 
extremely important. Combining that with incredibly low costs, low fares, and nonstop flights in markets that didn't 
have service before was like lightning in a bottle. People may love to complain about Ryanair, but they still fly the 
airline because it is cheap, reliable, and convenient. Ryanair didn't allow connections, even though its growing 
network meant those could be beneficial. That led to a cottage industry of others trying to cobble together 
connections on their own. There was clearly interest in connecting flights, but Ryanair had enough demand for 
nonstop service that it had no reason to bother with the complexity and cost. But as with any airline, growth can't 
continue forever. There's still opportunity, but Ryanair has to be more creative in finding ways to create demand for 
its services. One of those ways is by actually trying to cater to people on a level above just price and schedule. A 
couple years ago, Ryanair started the 'Always Getting Better' plan which was meant to soften the airline's image. 
CEO Michael O'Leary has long been known for his abrasive public demeanor, but it just didn't matter. Every time he 
did something crazy, he would just get more press for his airline. It's a strategy Spirit took to heart here in the US. 
But he changed his tune a couple years ago[1] when shareholders started ratcheting up the pressure. His response 
sounded like vintage O'Leary, but he struck an unusual conciliatory tone. We should try and eliminate things that 
unnecessarily piss people off And that is what the airline has done. It started with a redesign of the website and a 
changing of some of its more unfriendly policies. Now in year 3 of the 'Always Getting Better' plan[2], we see even 
more changing. Some of it is bluster, including the first point about offering even lower fares. But there is some real 
meat here. Little Ryanair is finally growing up.Possibly my favorite point is about plans for seating. 'New aircraft 
interiors featuring slimline seats, more leg room, coat hooks, LED lighting ...ss yellow.' Anyone who has flown those 
bright yellow bananas know that this is hugely welcome, but don't get too excited. As you can see above, there's 
still some yellow; it's just much more tasteful.The king of unbundling, Ryanair is delving further into re-bundling 
fares. It had previously launched its Business Plus bundle to try and attract the business traveler. That was 
improved in this round so that it now includes ticket flexibility and auto-check in. (It already had priority security and 
boarding, premium seating, a checked bag, and airport check-in.)It's also adding a new bundle to fit in between the 
Ryanair Gets Friendlier, Considers Connections for Growth
base price and Business Plus called Leisure Plus. This one will have reserved seats, priority boarding, and a 
checked bag. Presumably this is what people are booking individually now so this will make it easier (and possibly 
more lucrative, though I haven't seen pricing).Back in 2014, Ryanair introduced myRyanair. This was originally just 
a customer profile that people could set up to make booking and travel easier. But now it's growing beyond that into 
a semi-loyalty type of program. Users can get rewards by booking and flying Ryanair, though those appear to be 
mostly discount coupons off future travel, and it's not clear that there are any published earning rates. Members 
also will get early access to sale fares, and they'll be automatically checked in for flights.Ryanair continues to put 
more work into its mobile app. People will now have the ability to buy more ancillary services, make one-click 
payments, and rate their flights directly in the app.There are a few more pieces to the plan, and you can see it 
here[3], but this is all being designed to make it easier for people to book and travel on the airline. If this draws in 
more customers or gets people to pay for more services, then it's a win. Considering we're three years into the plan, 
it would seem to be a success. That being said, there is another way to generate passengers: connecting flights. As 
hub-and-spoke airlines know, the ability to connect passengers allows airlines to fly routes that wouldn't be 
supported by local traffic alone. It even goes beyond the traditional hub-and-spoke carrier. Think about something 
like Chicago to Flint (Michigan) on Southwest. There's no way that flight exists without connections. There are tons 
of flights that airlines operate because they can aggregate everyone in a hub and then funnel them on to a single 
flight. The fact that Ryanair doesn't do this shows the power of its network. As Ryanair starts to run out of 
expansion ideas, the easiest way to fix the problem is to look at smaller markets. And those markets may only work 
with connecting opportunities. This summer, Ryanair is going to trial selling connections[4] at London/Stansted and 
Barcelona. I can only assume that Ryanair will do something different than a traditional connection setup, because, 
well, it's Ryanair. Connecting people and bags can be costly. All of these things add up to an airline that is looking 
to keep its foot on the pedal when it comes to growth. The good news is that this is an airline that appears to be 
willing to re-evaluate its position in the world when needed and make the adjustments that are necessary. [Old

Apr 25, 2016( ACTmedia News: http://actmedia.eu Delivered by Newstex) Low cost air companies have contributed 
to the increase of the number of foreign tourists in Romania because of the low prices practised. Moreover there is 
a tendency of developing weekend tourism at least on weekends. Lucian Boronea, general manager of Accent 
Travel agency says he has noticed an opening of low cost companies to promoting Bucharest. It is a mistake of line 
companies which do not see that Bucharest is growing as a tourist destination. Blue Air, Wizz Air and Ryanair want 
joint campaigns promoting Bucharest. Representatives of low cost companies said they would participate to the 
budget promoting the Capital because they believed in this destination. The fact that Ryanair has an operation base 
in Bucharest with three air planes is just the beginning, said the general manager of Accent Travel. Last year the 
largest low cost company according to the number of passengers was Wizz Air, the Hungarian company which 
transports 4.5 million passengers on routes from and to Romania. Jozsef Varadi, CEO and founder of Wizz Air 
estimated recently that in five years from now his company will have 9-10 million passengers in Romania.

Three Great Airline Stocks to Buy This Earnings Season
Three Great Airline Stocks to Buy This Earnings Season

Apr 25, 2016( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) Expectations are sky-
high for airliners as they report their quarterly earnings over the next few weeks. As the Q1 earnings season builds 
momentum, it may be wise to invest in the airline space. Peers within this industry have been seeing earnings 
estimates trend upwards over the past few months. A lot of this has been driven by the high supply of crude oil in 
the market, and this has helped to drive fuel prices down for airliners. Fuel costs are one of the biggest expenses 
for airline corporations, so there are some opportunities to profit from higher margins experienced by the space over 
the short term. 
According to our Zacks Industry Rank, the airline space stands among the top 25% of all industries.Some airliners 
are already posting great numbers this earnings season. Controladora Vuela (VLRS) reported its earnings this 
morning, posting beats on our revenue and EPS consensus. As a result, its shares have picked up 3% in trading so 
far today. You don't want to miss out on this potential earnings party for the airline space, so we've listed three great 
airline stocks to consider buying before their earnings are released.Deutsche Lufthansa AG-DLAKY[1]Lufthansa is 
a German airline corporation. When including its subsidiaries, DLAKY is one of the largest passenger airline fleets 
in the world. The stock is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and it has a market cap of about $7.27 billion.Lufthansa is a 
valuable buy across some financial metrics. The corporation's shares trade at a forward PE multiple of just 4.61. 
DLAKY also trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) of just 0.2, while the average P/S in the airline space is 0.85.Lufthansa 
has beaten our EPS consensus in three of the last four quarters, with an average quarterly beat of 310.59% per 
quarter over that time frame. DLAKY is expected to report its earnings in the beginning of May.Ryanair Ltd-
RYAAY[2]Ryanair is an Irish, low-fare airliner that primarily operates from Europe. RYAAY is a Zacks Rank #2 
(Buy), and it has a large market cap of $20.74 billion.The company has a debt-to-equity of 0.91. It should be noted 
that the company has a PEG of just 0.45. A PEG under one suggests that a company may be undervalued. In the 
last 90 days, our EPS consensus has moved upwards. Three months ago, our EPS consensus for this quarter 
estimated earnings of $0.16. Now, our EPS consensus estimates earnings of $0.30. Ryanair is expected to report 
its earnings at the end of May.Skywest Inc-SKYW[3]Skywest Inc. operates one of the larger regional airlines in the 
United States. The airliner provides passenger and freight service, completing over 880 flights per day. Skywest is a 
Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This small-cap corporation has a market cap of just $1.03 billion. It sees more price 
movement than your average stock, as its beta is 1.67. It's worth noting that the stock doles out a 0.79% 
dividend.Skywest looks pretty cheap across some key valuation metrics. The company trades at a price-to-book of 
just 0.67. It also trades at a price-to-sales of 0.35. Both of these metrics are below one, which may suggest that 
Skywest is undervalued right now. Over the last 90 days, our EPS consensus has trended upwards, going from 
Three Great Airline Stocks to Buy This Earnings Season
$0.23 to $0.25. The airliner has beaten our earnings consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters. Over the 
last two quarters, the company has posted an average quarterly beat of 9.47%.The Zacks Rank is a truly marvelous 
trading tool. Our ranking system has beaten the S...00, yielding an average return of 25% per year for the last 29 
years! Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best

Announces Rankings of the Top U.K. Airlines Based on Social Media Performance and Word of Mouth 
ConversationsLONDON, U.K. - April 14, 2016 - Technology and data company Engagement Labs, creator of the 
eValue™ score, released its data rankings on the top airlines serving the UK, on both social media and through 
offline word of mouth (WOM) conversations.The data consists of Engagement Labs' proprietary eValue social 
media measurement tool and TalkTrack®, the leading measurement source of word of mouth conversations from 
the Keller Fay Group, an Engagement Labs company.Top U.K. Airlines on Social Media and for Word of Mouth

eValueTM U.K. 2016 rankings of Airlines on social media and Keller Fay's TalkTrack® UK 2016 rankings of 
Airlines. 'For airlines, social media acts as an important extension of a brand's customer service, providing an 
avenue for consumers to ask questions and communicate directly with the airline, at an often stressful time" said 
Steve Thomson, UK Managing Director at Keller Fay and Engagement Labs. 
'Therefore social media becomes a critical tool for airlines to connect with their consumers, answer questions, help 
mitigate challenges and respond to issues, all in real time. Gone are the days of sending an email to customer 
service departments and waiting for a response. Social media provides consumers the opportunity to interact 
immediately and for brands to react accordingly, demonstrating dedication to their customers and to finding 
solutions."On Facebook KLM ranked first for eValue and Impact score. The brand also had an impressive 
Responsiveness score which is clearly evident when looking at the brand's channel and their continuous comments 
and responses to consumer posts. Budget airline Ryanair ranked second for overall eValue score. Emirates came 
in a close third with the highest Engagement score. Although the brand posted 79 times - in comparison to 
Ryanair's 509 posts - Emirates saw more engagement from fans, demonstrating that the brand has a great 
understanding of its audience and the content which encourages interaction. Emirates also enjoys positive offline 
word of mouth (WOM).On Twitter Ryanair took the top spot for eValue score with the second highest Engagement 
score. As seen on Facebook, the brand continued to post very frequently, almost 6 times more than the second and 
third ranked brands, British Airways and easyJet, respectively. British Airways secured the highest Responsiveness

Conversations
score and admin replies, indicating their commitment to communicating with followers, while easyJet had the 
highest Engagement score.KLM again led the fleet on Instagram with the highest Impact and Responsiveness 
scores. Ryanair took second place with the highest Engagement score. The brand's Instagram channel comprised 
of a mix of professional and user-generated images. Especially on Instagram, user-generated content is an 
excellent method for brands to create follower engagement and build trust among audiences.'For the airline 
industry, social media is the perfect avenue to integrate marketing and brand messaging with customer service. 
Hence, having an understanding of how a brand is measuring online is important to ensure you have the right 
messages targeting your consumers. However, social media is only part of the equation. For companies to have a 
360 degree view of their brand they must also understand how people are talking about them through word of 
mouth conversations and the sentiment behind the conversations," added Thomson.Although KLM secured top 
spots on social media, the brand ranked sixth for WOM, with 58% of the conversations being positive. This 
highlights that although KLM's social strategy is encouraging engagement online, the company should examine 
how they can translate online conversation into positive offline conversation.Finally, Virgin Atlantic arguably faces 
the opposite problem: a base of positive sentiment in WOM is not reflected in the brand's engagement via social 
media - a missed opportunity given the brand's high profile. About Engagement LabsEngagement Labs offers 
intelligent data, analytics and insights for marketers and organizations to track, measure and benchmark the 
conversations happening around their brand or industry, both online and offline. These conversations are proven to 
drive critical business outcomes, including sales, while Engagement Labs' tools provide the data and actionable 
insight to help guide business decisions and power marketing effectiveness.eValue™ Analytics is the global

Mar 22, 2016( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)  European shares have 
dropped after a series of explosions in Brussels left many people dead. The tourism sector was already reeling from 
recent suicide attacks in Istanbul, Turkey, and other popular destinations. 
Multiple explosions tore through the departure hall of the Brussels airport on Tuesday, followed by another blast at 
a metro station near the headquarters of the European Commission. The attacks left at least 21 people dead, 
firefighters in the Belgian capital were quoted as saying. The violence also hit major stock indexes across Europe, 
where investors were on tenterhooks over fears of a new wave of terrorism on the Continent and at popular travel 
destinations. Belgian shares sank 0.7 percent, while the German DAX and the EuroStoxx50 indexes each lost 0.9 
percent to 9,854 points and 3,021 points, respectively. The losses were starker earlier in the day before recovering 
slightly. The STOXX Europe 600 Travel and Leisure index was also down, with shares in easyJet, Ryanair, 
Lufthansa, Air France and TUI all wavering. The British pound was also down amid fears that the explosions at the 
Zaventem airport and Maelbeek metro station could play a role in an upcoming referendum on Britain's membership 
in the EU. Tourism in an age of terrorism The attacks in Brussels came only days after a suicide bomber hit a 
popular street in Istanbul, Turkey. It was the second terrorist attack on the city in as many months. Last year was 
also rocked by violence, including a deadly shooting at a beach resort in Tunisia, a bomb that brought down a 
Russian passenger jet while it was flying over Egypt, killing everyone on board, and coordinated shooting and 
suicide bomb attacks in the French capital, Paris, which left 130 people dead. "Geopolitical risk, including acts of 
terrorism which directly affect trade or movement, remains a significant risk factor to monitor," Lorne Baring, the 
managing director of B Capital Wealth Management in Geneva, told Reuters. cjc/hch (AFP, Reuters, dpa)

Mar 22, 2016( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  WikimediaUS stock 
futures were trading in the red on Tuesday morning ahead of the start of the session. Near 7:15 a.m. ET, Dow 
futures were off 30 points, S...00 futures were down 5 points, and Nasdaq futures were down 12 points. Top of mind 
around the world this morning are the two explosions in Brussels[1]. At least 28 people were killed in the attacks on 
an airport and metro station. 
Public transport is under lockdown. No clear motive has been established.  European stock indexes were also 
trading a bit lower, with the Euro Stoxx 50 off 0.2%. Shares of airlines that operate in the region were also under 
pressure. Ryanair, an Irish low-cost airline, fell as much as 2% in Dublin. Lufthansa was down 1.5% in Frankfurt 
trading. Air France fell 4.5% in Paris. In an email to clients, Marc Chandler and his currency strategy team at Brown 
Brothers Harriman noted that the attacks are dampening sentiment across the market. They wrote, "The attacks 
come as Europe prepares what for many will be a long holiday weekend. Gold, the dollar and yen seem to have 
been the beneficiaries. Bonds are generally firmer and equities lower. However, in late morning activity in London, 
the markets began stabilizing."  Gold gained about 0.6%, or $8 an ounce, to as high as $1,260.80. The 10-year 
yield fell one basis point to 1.905%.  In US economic data today, we'll get the preliminary Markit manufacturing PMI 
for March. After a number of solid regional readings in the past few days, economists will be looking out for whether 
there is truly a turnaround in the sector. The FHFA house price index for January is also due.  Refresh this page for

Mar 22, 2016( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  REUTERS/Bertil 
Enevag Ericson/TT News AgencyScandinavian Airlines is in the process of a transformation. The 70-year old 
company serves as the national airline of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. SAS currently flies more than 28 million 
passengers a year on routes to nearly 120 destinations from its hubs in Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm. 
Although SAS is firmly entrenched in its position as one of Europe's leading legacy carriers, the airline has come 
under immense pressure in recent years from low cost carriers such as Ryanair, EasyJet and Oslo, Norway-based 
Norwegian Air Shuttle.  At the controls of this multi-national, international airline is the company's president and 
CEO Rickard Gustafson. 
Gustafson spoke with Business Insider recently around the launch of the airline's new route from Stockholm, 
Sweden to Los Angeles.  He said airline customers care about cost more than anything else.  "This business has 
become a low-margin business," Gustafson said. "If you want to jump into this game, you have to have a 
proposition that's above all else really competitive on cost." Gustafson — whose resume includes a long career at 
GE Capital and a stint as CEO of Codan Insurance - took over the top job at SAS in February of 2011.  "If you aren't 
cost competitive, don't even bother."On low-cost carriers"Today, the European market is actually defined by the 
low-cost model," Gustafson said. "If you want to make money, you have to compete against low-cost carriers." In 
1993, Norwegian Air Shuttle and its low cost business model opened up shop in Oslo. In the 23 years since, the 
airline has grown to become a major competitor for SAS in its own backyard. In 2015, Norwegian served more than 
26 million passengers.  But SAS isn't standing idle.  "We have made significant transformative changes to stay 
competitive and to survive," Gustafson added. "We have cut overhead costs, adjusted pensions and union 
contracts." According to the SAS CEO, his company has to keep adapting to its environment to survive. "We are not 
done changing yet because the low-cost competition is growing everyday." According to SAS, low-cost competition 
(including Norwegian Air Shuttle) in Scandinavia has grown to cover roughly 35% of the market. As a result of the 
efforts of SAS and other legacy carriers, LCC's marketshare has stabilized at that 35% figure.On Scandinavia's role 
in future of European aviationAmsterdam, Frankfurt and London Heathrow have all become major transit hubs by 
capitalizing on business from passengers using the airport as a gateway to Europe and Asia.  SAS currently 
operates out of three main hubs in Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen. However, Gustafson does not 
believe Scandinavia and his airline will head in that direction. "I don't really see using Scandinavia as a transfer 
hub," Gustafson said. "Our geographic location is not really ideal for a transit-based business. To make it work, you 
would have to find a way to generate a lot of traffic from central Europe to Scandinavia and then you would also 
Passengers only care about one thing — and it's creating a huge shift at one of the world's oldest airlines
have to compete with the Middle East and other European hubs. "Trying to turn Scandinavia into a transit hub 
would be expensive and dangerous for us to undertake." As a result, SAS is more focused on developing routes 
that would serve destination travelers.  "When we look for new destinations, we look for a good mix of business and 
leisure travel. We look for routes with enough demand for travel directly between that destination and 
Scandinavia."On the future of the airline's fleetSAS currently operates a fleet of roughly 150 regional, narrow body 
mainline and widebody long haul airliners from Bombardier, Boeing and Airbus. One of the airline's widebody 
workhorses is the Airbus A340-300. The model was launched in the early 1990s for long range intercontinental 
routes. However, due to its less than ideal fuel economy, the A340 fell out of favor with many of its operators over 
the past few years. Airlines have elected to retire the four-engined jet in favor of more fuel efficient, twin-engine jets 
such as the Boeing 777 and Airbus A330.  But SAS will be sticking with its A340-300 fleet. "We are keeping them 
around," Gustafson said. "Our next round of expansion will be using our A340s." A few years ago, the airline placed 
orders for new Airbus A320neo single aisle jets as well as A330-300E and A350-900 long haul wide-bodies. As a 
result of the cheaper fuel, ordering new aircraft has become more difficult to justify and the older A340 is now a 
rather attractive proposition.  "When we ordered our new (more fuel efficient jets), the decision was made with the 
price of fuel at $1000 per ton, today it's half that amount," the CEO explained. "To buy a new widebody jet requires 
hundreds of millions of dollars in costs. We can operate our A340s for a tenth of that." NOW WATCH: Here's

Mar 22, 2016( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)  European and US shares 
have dropped only temporarily after a series of explosions in Brussels left many people dead. The tourism sector 
was the biggest loser, but other stocks recovered in the course of the trading day. 
The attacks in Brussels hit major stock indexes in early trading across Europe and the US, where investors were on 
tenterhooks over fears of a new wave of terrorism on the Continent and at popular travel destinations worldwide. 
Belgian shares sank early in the day; so did the German DAX and the EuroStoxx50 indexes. The STOXX Europe 
600 Travel and Leisure index was also down, with shares in easyJet, Ryanair, Lufthansa, Air France and TUI all 
wavering. The British pound also fell amid fears that the explosions at the Zaventem airport and Maelbeek metro 
station could play a role in an upcoming referendum on Britain's membership in the EU. But traders in Europe saw 
a lot of the losses pared as the day continued, with the FTSE-100 in London closing in positive territory, albeit only 
marginally (+0.1 percent). Germany's blue-chip DAX-30 ended the trading session up 0.42 percent, but many 
tourism and travel-related stocks remained in negative territory across Europe. Across the Atlantic, US stocks also 
opened lower following the coordinated attacks in the European Union's de facto capital. Only minutes after the 
opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by less than 1 percent. The S...00 and the Nasdaq 
Composite Index followed suit. Shares in Delta Air Lines were down, as was United Continental. The hotel chain 
Hilton Worldwide was also down 1.8 percent, while online travel companies Priceline and Expedia each lost 2.1 
percent and 1.8 percent. Tourism in an age of terrorism The attacks in Brussels came only days after a suicide 
bomber hit a popular street in Istanbul, Turkey. It was the second terrorist attack on the city in as many months.

French aviation strike disrupts flights across Europe
French aviation strike disrupts flights across Europe

Mar 21, 2016( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)  Up to a third of all flights 
to and from French airports were canceled on Monday, as air traffic controllers entered a second day of strikes 
against staff and spending cuts, but also against a lack of investment. 
The French Civil Aviation Authority called for airlines to cancel more flights on Monday, following a weekend of 
disrupted flight schedules due to an air traffic control staff walkout. Unsa, France's third largest union for air traffic 
controllers, said it coordinated the walkout in protest against a cap on recruitment, and a lack of investment in the 
new computer systems used by controllers. Europe wide disruption  The strike has disrupted hundreds of flights 
throughout Europe, with Paris' Orly airport particularly hard hit: 33 percent of all flights arriving and departing from 
the airport were impacted by the strike action on Monday morning. The walkout also disrupted general air traffic 
over France, meaning flights that neither take off nor land at a French airport were also affected. Ryanair calls for 
action  Budget airline Ryanair reported that it had already canceled 200 flights on Monday, while Easyjet said it had 
cancelled 96, including flights to and from Berlin. Ryanair deplored what it said was the 41st strike by French air 
traffic controllers since 2009 and has called upon the French government and European Commission to take action 
against the strike. Flights across Europe are expected to be disrupted until 5 a.m. Central European Time on 
Tuesday morning, after which air traffic controllers are scheduled to return to work. AFP/dpa (hch, hg)

Mar 12, 2016( Luxurylaunches: http://www.luxurylaunches.com Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair may be best known 
for being a low cost carrier, but the airline appears to be expanding their customer base by launching a private jet 
charter service. The airline is all set to offer a customized Boeing 737-700 to clients looking to travel in style. The 
plane will be fitted with 60 reclining business class seats and will offer passengers fine dining options, a far cry from 
the Irish airline's usual offerings. Ryanair's Head of Communications Robin Kiely revealed that the launch has 
created considerable interest saying, 'We were inundated with requests not just from corporate bookers and finance 
companies, but also had a number of wedding enquiries too.'Kiely didn't reveal the cost of chartering the plane, but 
apparently the rates will be 'competitive.' He also added that while the plane's home base will be Dublin Airport, it 
can quickly be transferred to any of the 200 airports in Europe that Ryanair flies to. 'Europe is pretty much your 
oyster,' he said. The plane will be available for six hour journeys. [ Via : Independent[1] ] [ 1]:

stocks held near session highs Friday heading into the last hour of the regular trading session. The Nasdaq led with 
a 1.5% advance, the S...00 rose 1.3%, and the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.1%. Volume was lower 
across the board vs. 
the same time Thursday. The major market indexes were on track to extend their gains for a fourth straight week. 
Winners swamped losers by more than a 4-1 ratio on the NYSE and by about 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Only 2 of the 
Dow's 30 stocks were lower. Oil stocks led the upside in the stock market today[1], as West Texas Intermediate 
crude prices rose 2% to $38.70 a barrel. Specialty retail and hospitals also outperformed. The specialty retail group 
got a boost from Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which vaulted more than 16% to a new high, clearing a 188.58 buy point in 
heavy trade. The stock gapped up past its 50-day and 200-day moving average lines. After the close Thursday, the 
beauty store operator reported quarterly earnings that topped views and guided full-year EPS and revenue above 
consensus estimates. Telsey Advisory Group on Friday boosted its price target to 215 from 210. Airlines lifted more 
than 2% to regain their 200-day moving average. Alaska Air Group (ALK) soared 5%, clearing a 78.59 cup-with-
handle buy point in higher-than-normal volume. Among other carriers, Southwest Airlines (LUV) rose 3%, and IBD 
50[2] stock Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) picked up 2% to retake its 50-day line. Also in the IBD 50, Dollar General 
(DG) added 2% to a new high in fast turnover, following up on Thursday's 11% jump. Shares are now 10% 
extended past a 76.85 cup-with-handle buy point cleared Thursday, after the discount retailer's Q4 earnings beat

A rebound in crude oil prices continued to prop up the stock market Wednesday afternoon, though volume was 
subdued. The S...00 advanced 0.3%, while the Nasdaq and Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.2% and 0.1%, 
respectively. Volume in the stock market today[1] declined about 10% on both major exchanges vs. 
the previous session's pace. Volume has faded each day this week. Blue chips were mixed Wednesday but showed 
selective strength. Dow component Chevron (CVX) rumbled 6% higher in more than twice its usual volume. The 
move constituted a breakout from a double-bottom base within a larger consolidation. The buy point is 94.10. 
Although the pattern does have a more-than-30% prior uptrend, the stock is not highly rated. The EPS Rating is 19, 
which means about 81% of stocks are growing earnings faster. Among widely held stocks, Microsoft (MSFT) poked 
above its 50-day line in soft trade. The stock gained 2% and is only 7% off its high, working on a new base. In the 
IBD 50, a list of the strongest stocks in terms of both fundamentals and technicals, 4 of every 5 stocks were up. 
Chip designer MaxLinear (MXL) led with a 5% gain, while Ryanair (RYAAY) was the biggest loser with a 2% drop. 
Higher oil prices raise the costs for airlines. West Texas Intermediate crude oil jumped by almost 4% to just under 
$38 a barrel. Spot gold fell 0.6%, and copper rose 1.4%. [ 1]: http://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-

Mar 05, 2016( The Aviationist: http://theaviationist.com Delivered by Newstex)  On Mar. 1, 2016 two Israeli Air 
Force (IAF) F-16 Fighting Falcons[1] involved in a training exercise over the Negev desert[2] converged on the flight 
path of a Ryanair Boeing 737[3] on landing approach at Ovda airport[4] in Israel. 
Several media outlets claimed that the two IAF fighter jets came 'dangerously close' to the Ryanair aircraft, which 
had 162 passengers on board, and that a mid-air collision[5] was prevented only thanks to the airliner pilot who 
changed the course of his aircraft at the very last moment. But as reported by TimesofIsrael.com, Ryanair denied 
any claim of a near-miss. According to the airline, the flight from Krakow to Ovda was cruising at 27,000 ft in Israeli 
airspace[6] when the aircrew noticed two IAF F-16s climbing towards their flight path. As pointed out by a Ryanair 
statement, the two fighters remained at '3 miles away from the aircraft, so the reports of a 'nearly crash' or 'evasive 
manoeuvres' are all false and invented.' The airline also added that the Ryanair aircrew alerted the Air Traffic 
Control[7] which vectored the F-16s away from their Boeing 737. 'All passengers on board the Ryanair aircraft 
noticed nothing, since our aircraft never diverted from its cleared flight path to Ovda.' Although no injures or 
damages were reported, Israel's Transportation Ministry and the Israeli Air Force will investigate the matter. Image

Feb 28, 2016( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex)  A 
rowdy bachelor party on a flight to Bratislava has prompted a Ryanair pilot to make an unscheduled stop in Berlin, 
German police say. The men allegedly grew aggressive after the crew stopped serving them alcohol. 
The groom-to-be and five of his friends could face fines of up to 25,000 euros ($27,000), according to the police. 
The British nationals were "under the influence of alcohol" while flying from London to Bratislava for a bachelor 
party late Saturday, authorities said. They allegedly refused to stay in their seats, clashed with the cabin crew and 
started behaving aggressively after they were refused alcohol. One of the men reportedly took his clothes off. 
Eventually, the crew determined they "misbehaved so badly," that the pilot decided to divert the plane to Berlin's 
Schoenefeld airport.  Berlin police detained six of the alleged offenders, all aged between 25 and 28 and hailing 
from Southampton in southern England. Another six people from the same group were allowed to stay on board. 
"We will not tolerate unruly or disruptive behavior at any time and the safety and comfort of our customers, crew 
and aircraft is our number one priority," Ryanair said in a statement quoted by Southampton's Daily Echo. "This is 
now a matter for local police," the company added. After the stop in Berlin, the remaining 164 passengers were able 
to continue their flight to Bratislava. The British nationals were released after several hours. In addition to high fines, 
they could also be targeted with civil claims from the low-cost airline. dj/jlw (AFP, AP, dpa)

Feb 17, 2016( Stock Market Today: http://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/ Delivered by Newstex)  The

oil prices and upside earnings reports. The Nasdaq surged 2.2%, while the S...00 and Dow Jones industrial 
average each rose 1.6%. Volume was higher across the board, according to preliminary data, indicating conviction 
behind the buying. 
Stocks rose early and extended their gains throughout the session. Economic data were mixed, with January 
housing starts falling more than expected and producer prices rising above forecasts. Core PPI was the strongest 
since October 2014. WTI crude leapt 5% to more than $30 a barrel after Iran's oil minister said the country will 
support moves to help stabilize oil prices. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to freeze output at January 
levels. Oil and gas stocks, online travel agents and automakers led the upside in Wednesday's stock market 
rally[1]. Chevron (CVX) led the Dow with a 4% jump. Also among energy plays, Kinder Morgan (KMI) gapped up

stake in the natgas transporter in Q4, according to an SEC filing. Priceline (PCLN) gapped up and soared 11%, 
leaping past its 50-day line and nearly retaking its 200-day line in speedy trade. Shares are now 16% below their 
52-week high. The online travel booker late Wednesday reported Q4 profit and revenue that topped views. Tesla 
(TSLA) cruised 9% higher for its fourth straight advance in above-average volume. The stock, at 41% off its 52-
week high, is still well below its 50-day and 200-day lines. Shares rose amid reports that SolarCity (SCTY) has 
selected the electric automaker to provide batteries to power a solar project it's working on for Kaua'i Island Utility 
Cooperative. SolarCity shares spiked 13% in robust trade. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is also chairman of the solar 
installer. Fortune magazine also reported an SEC filing showed Musk bought $10 million worth of SolarCity shares 
on Friday. On the IBD 40, NetEase (NTES), Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) and Ellie Mae (ELLI) rallied, with respective 
gains of 4%, 5% and 6%, all in higher-than-usual turnover. Economic data slated for Thursday include the weekly 
jobless claims report, weekly petroleum inventory data and the Philly Fed business outlook survey for February. 
San Francisco Fed chief John Williams is also scheduled to speak. BJ's Restaurants (BJRI), MGM Resorts (MGM) 
and Waste Management (WM) are among companies reporting quarterly results Thursday. [ 1]:

shook off steep early losses to wrap up a seesaw session with mild losses Tuesday, ahead of Walt Disney's (DIS) 
much anticipated earnings report. The Nasdaq composite dipped 0.3%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and 
S...00 each gave up just 0.1%. Volume was lighter across the board in the stock market today[1], according to 
preliminary figures. Losers topped winners by nearly 5-to-2 on the NYSE and 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. 
After the close, Disney reported fiscal Q1 profit of $1.63 a share on $15.24 billion in revenue, above views for $1.45 
on $14.75 billion. The results got a boost from its studio division, which saw earnings jump 86% on strength from its 
blockbuster hit 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens.' Disney's theme parks unit's earnings rose 22%, but its TV 
networks, which includes ESPN, fell 6%. Shares initially rose after hours, but reversed to fall nearly 5%. The stock 
has declined since a November breakout from a cup-with-handle base failed. It's down 24% from its 52-week high. 
Energy stocks led the decline during the regular session, as West Texas Intermediate crude plunged 5% to $28.27 
a barrel. Chevron (CVX[2]) weighed on the Dow with an almost 4% drop, while Exxon Mobil (XOM[3]) slipped 
more than 1%. In the broader market, toy makers and steel stocks also posted big losses. Beverage, airline and 
other travel-related stocks outperformed. Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY[4]) soared almost 3%, regaining its 200-day 
line in average trade after spending two sessions below the support level. The stock is still well below its 50-day line 
and 13% off its high. Among other carriers, Hawaiian Holdings (HA[5]) added 5%, and Alaska Air Group (ALK[6]) 
improved by 4%. Spirit Airlines (SAVE[7]) rose 6%. Before the open, the Florida-based discount carrier reported Q4 
results[8] that topped views on both the top and bottom lines. Fuel costs dropped 38% to $1.59 per gallon. But total 
operating revenue per available seat mile fell 16% from a year earlier. The stock has rebounded 30% from its 
November lows but is still 49% off its 52-week high. TransDigm Group (TDG[9]), down 13% in massive volume, was 
the biggest loser on the IBD 50 after the aircraft components maker reported fiscal Q1 earnings that missed views. 
The stock fell sharply below the bottom of a flat base it had been carving since August. Notable companies 
reporting quarterly earnings Wednesday include Cisco Systems (CSCO), Expedia (EXPE), O'Reilly Automotive 
(ORLY), Tesla Motors (TSLA) and Twitter (TWTR). Economic data due out in the morning include weekly MBA 
mortgage applications, the weekly petroleum status report and the Treasury budget for January. Fed chief Janet 
Yellen 
and 
the 
San 
Francisco 
Fed's 
John 
Williams

were lower, but well off their morning lows, as investors weighed falling oil prices against bullishness in Japan over 
negative interest rates. The Nasdaq fell 0.2%, while the S...00 and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.3% 
each. 
Volume was tracking lower on both exchanges in the stock market today[1]. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index was up 
2% overnight, basking in the afterglow of Friday's decision by the Bank of Japan to use negative interest rates to 
help stimulate the country's stagnant economy. Nippon Telegraph ...lephone (NTT), the big Japanese telco, gapped 
up to trade nearly 3% higher. It's at its highest level in 15 years. Volume was running high on ADRs that trade on 
the NYSE. However, the Shanghai composite lost 2%, and European markets were trading moderately lower. West 
Texas Intermediate crude oil futures for March delivery were trading at $31.99 a barrel, a 5% plunge. Among IBD 
50 stocks, 31 were higher and 19 were lower. Facebook (FB) was among the top performers on the elite list, up 
more than 2% in volume that was well above average. It broke out of a base with a 110.75 buy point Friday in the 
wake of a better-than-expected earning report. As oil falls, airlines rise. Ryanair (RYAAY) was among the upside 
volume leaders with a nearly 4% gain. The Irish airline announced it is doubling its stock buyback program to 800 
million euros ($870 million) in spite of weak sales in the aftermath of the Paris terrorist attack. [ 1]:

stayed firmly in the red in early afternoon trading Monday as oil prices, economic data and China's market 
continued to weigh. The S...00 and Dow Jones industrial average were each down 0.6%, while the Nasdaq fell 
0.5%. Volume was lighter across the board vs. 
the same time Friday. Losers topped winners by 2-to-1 on the NYSE and nearly a 3-2 margin on the Nasdaq. Oil 
stocks led the decline as West Texas intermediate crude prices sank 6% to below $32 a barrel. Steel and toy maker 
stocks were also down hard. Mattel (MAT) fell 5% in heavy trade ahead of its Q4 earnings report due after the 
close. The stock is shaping the handle of a cup-with-handle base with a 30.54 buy point, but is still 47% off its May 
2013 peak. Analysts expect the Barbie and Hot Wheels maker to earn 61 cents a share on $1.91 billion in revenue. 
Mattel on Thursday said its Barbie Dolls will be available in three new body types: curvy, petite and tall, as well as a 
variety of skin tones, eye colors and hairstyles. Online travel bookers, airlines and automakers outperformed. 
Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) gapped up and soared 4% in fast turnover as it tried to regain its 50-day moving 
average. The stock may be forming a new base. It triggered the 8% loss sell rule last week after falling below an 
85.66 flat-base buy point. The Irish discount carrier said its fiscal Q3 profit doubled and announced a stock buyback 
of 800 million euros ($870 million). Jetblue Airways (JBLU) lifted 3% in above-average volume as shares continue 
to trade below their conjoined 200-day and 50-day lines. The stock carried its momentum from Friday, when it rose 
7% after the airline reported Q4 earnings and revenue that topped views. Barclays on Monday cut its price target to 
29 from 32 amid concerns related to the Zika virus. Alphabet (GOOGL) climbed 1% in rapid trade ahead of its Q4 
report, also due after the close. Analysts expect the Internet giant's EPS to rise 18% to $8.10 on 15% higher 
revenue to $20.77 billion. Shares are extended past a 713.43 buy point cleared Oct. 23. On the IBD 50, Facebook 
(FB) added 2% to a new high, on track to extend its win streak for a third straight session since Thursday, when the 
stock vaulted 16% on a big Q4 beat. Shares are near the top of a buy range from a 110.75 entry.

down 0.4% each while the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.5%. Volume was tracking lower than the same time

Amazon (AMZN) was off 1%. A Bloomberg report said the company is planning a global delivery service to compete 
against FedEx (FDX), United Parcel (UPS) and Alibaba (BABA). The service would seek to control the flow of 
goods from factories in China and India to customers in U.S. and European cities. The service, to be called Global 
Supply Chain by Amazon, could start up as soon as this year. Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL), which have 
had multiday sell-offs, rose nearly 2% as they struggled to recover. IBD 50 stocks were roughly evenly divided 
between gainers and decliners. The best performer on the elite list was Ryanair (RYAAY), up nearly 4% as it sought 
to recover its 200-day moving average. The worst performer was Scripps Network Interactive (SNI), down nearly

Jan 21, 2016( Phys.org - Science and Technology News: http://phys.org/ Delivered by Newstex)  Google revealed 
on Thursday that it sidelined more than 780 million ads deemed rude, dishonest or dangerous in 2015 in a leap 
from the 524 million targeted a year earlier. "Some ads[1] are just plain bad—like ads that carry malware, cover up 
content you're trying to see, or promote fake goods," Google senior vice president of ads and commerce Sridhar 
Ramaswamy said in a blog post. 
"Bad ads can ruin your entire online experience, a problem we take very seriously." Google has a team of more 
than 1,000 people around the world devoted to fighting "bad ads," and has armed them with sophisticated 
technology, according to Ramaswamy. Google disables ads for violating the California-based Internet giant's 
policies. More than 10,000 websites and 18,000 accounts were suspended for hawking counterfeit goods such as 
designer watch knock-offs, and Google blocked more than 12.5 million healthcare-related ads that included offering 
drugs that were approved for use or made claims that weren't properly supported. Weight-loss scams were among 
top complaints by Google users last year, and the company responded by suspending more than 30,000 websites 
for making misleading claims, Ramaswamy said. Google also blocked nearly 7,000 "phishing" websites crafted to 
looked like online pages of legitimate businesses such as banks but intended to trick people into entering 
passwords or other personal information. "We got even tougher on ads that mislead or trick people into interacting 
with them—like ads designed to look like system warnings from your computer," Ramaswamy said. "In 2015 alone 
we rejected more than 17 million." Google vowed to ramp the war on bad online ads this year along. It also said it 
will increase defenses against malicious software and computer networks known as "bots" programmed to 
automatically click online ads to drive up revenue from pay-per-click marketing messages. Relevant stories Google

PGby Liam Farrell 'How long does granny have, doctor?' 'Only a few days,' I said. I was young and beautiful and 
too green to know that the wise clinician always fudges the prognosis. 
Within minutes the message was winging its way across the globe. A few nights later and there were relatives 
tucked in every corner, swinging on the rafters, hanging from the roof, dangling from the curtains. Not that granny 
was an angel. To paraphrase Jonathan Swift: true to her profit and her pride, she made them weep before she died. 
But as La Rochefoucauld observed, we are more often loved for our vices than our virtues, and the relatives had 
ridden in on the four winds, swum dangerous rivers, climbed huge mountains, endured biting insects and even 
Ryanair flights. They'd come from Boston, Singapore, Sydney, Vladivostok, all determined to be there at granny's 
deathbed. So I was disconcerted to find granny looking much better, quite perky even. Breaking bad news is all part 
of the job, but breaking good news was a novel challenge. I'd parked my car on a downhill slope, facing away from 
the cottage, to facilitate a quick getaway. If it proved a long pursuit, had I enough petrol, I wondered. 'I have good 
news,' I said, trying gamely to give it a positive spin, 'Your granny's not dying after all. She's looking much better. 
Ain't that great?' There was an ominous silence, which, inexperienced as I was, I felt compelled to fill. 'Underneath it 
all, she has a great engine, heart like a lion, strong as a horse, and all,' I continued, starting to babble, hoping that 
this testament to the clan's animal virility might soften the blow. 'We were told she was very ill,' accused Boston. A 
rebellious muttering began. 'It's cost me a bloody fortune,' from the deserts of Sudan. 'My return flight is next 
weekend,' from the gardens of Japan. 'I've taken a week off work for this,' from Milan. 'I knew there was bugger all 
wrong with her,' from Yucatan. The crowd shifted threateningly forward, as crowds do when someone has a rope, a 
nearby tree has a convenient low branch, and the gestalt has a lynching in mind. 'Don't lose hope,' I said, 'I've 
adopted the Liverpool Care Pathway.'Dr Liam Farrell (@drlfarrell[1]) has been a columnist for many years, for the 
BMJ and Lancet among others. He was a family doctor for 20 years in Crossmaglen, Ireland, and is a former tutor

Jan 20, 2016( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)  Europe's largest airline 
groups have launched a new alliance in a bid to become stronger in the face of more competition from Gulf rivals. 
Among other things, the association wants to fight rising airport charges. Europe's five largest airline groups on 
Wednesday called into being a new alliance meant to boost the carriers' clout in talks and negotiation with officials 
and policymakers. Dubbed Airlines for Europe (A4E), the alliance brings together budget carriers such as Easyjet 
and Ryanair with the sector's giants, including Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and the International Airline Group (IAG), 
the parent company of both British Airways and Iberia. "The alliance will represent the interests of its members 
when dealing with the EU institutions, international organizations and national governments on European aviation 
issues," it said in a statement at the launch at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport.  Rough deal for travelers? The alliance 
called for swift steps to stop European travelers "being fleeced by excessive airport charges." Citing a recent study, 
it revealed that airport charges at the 21 largest European aviation hubs had soared by 80 percent since 2005. The 
alliance said it also intended to push for a more reliable airspace by reducing the costs of air traffic control through 
the completion of the Single European Sky scheme. Launched in the late 1990s, the aim of the project is to make 
European skies more competitive, secure and environmentally friendly by eliminating national borders in control 
systems. hg/jd (AFP, Reuters)

Jan 19, 2016( BusinessPundit: http://www.businesspundit.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Delta saved $5.1 billion on 
fuel last year as oil prices plummeted. The company in return posted an annual profit of $4.5 billion in 2015. 
The airline also revealed that it hopes to save another $3 billion in 2016 as a result of lower energy prices. 
While lowering fuel prices helped the airline, officials say sales were off by 2% as a strong US dollar played against 
international tourism to the United States. Its quarterly profits were also lower than expected. Delta isn't expecting 
much improvement in the first quarter either. It said that passenger unit revenue will be down 2.5% to 4.5% from a 
year ago — caused mostly by currently fluctuations. Flights in Europe, Asia and Latin America account for nearly 
30% of Delta's passenger revenue. The airline says it expects profit margins to improve in the quarter. Its stock was 
up more than 3% in early trading Tuesday. Despite lower fuel prices, shares at Delta are down 12% in 2016. Other 
airlines with declining stock include United, American, Southwest, JetBlue, and others. Delta has reported that miles 
flown rose 3% in the fourth quarter. Load factor, which measures the overall number of people on a flight hit 85.2%, 
up from 82.8% a year ago. Delta and many of its premiere competitors have also been pressured to lower prices as 
airlines such as Southwest and RyanAir continue to attract bargain shoppers for domestic flights. The post Delta

The Idea of Low Cost Carriers Connecting with Legacy Carriers Is Not New, But It Is for Ryanair and easyJet
The Idea of Low Cost Carriers Connecting with Legacy Carriers Is Not New, 
But It Is for Ryanair and easyJet
The Cranky Flier

Jan 14, 2016( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> This week, the Financial 
Times looked at the purportedly novel idea that Ryanair and easyJet may try to cooperate with legacy carriers to 
transfer passengers[1]. This would be news for those two airlines, but it's not a surprise. While it's certainly not 
something without precedent, this plan is a little different. It's going to be much harder to make this work.<nl/>
<nl/>The article talks about how both easyJet and Ryanair are interested in bringing people to gateway cities and 
then transferring them to traditional long haul carriers. In other words, they're looking for an interline agreement, but 
with a twist (which we'll get into later). That these airlines are exploring this possibility is not surprising at all 
considering where they are in their histories.<nl/> When new airlines start, most fail in a short period of time. But 
when an airline finds a niche that works, it looks to grow quickly. Not only does growth help to keep unit costs lower 
(constantly adding new, entry level wages) but it also helps to compete with other airlines that might try to serve the 
same niche. During this phase of life, the goal is to just keep growing and keep costs low. It's a beautiful thing.<nl/> 
Eventually, however, airlines start looking for other avenues to keep growth rates up. They start to realize that 
having the lowest costs won't necessarily matter if they can increase revenue more than they increase costs. While 
low cost carriers traditionally don't like the idea of partnering with other airlines because of the costs involved, the 
older they get, the more benefit they see.<nl/> In the US, take a look at JetBlue in New York and Boston. Look at 
Virgin America in San Francisco and LA. And though it's a slightly different model, look at Alaska in Seattle and 
Hawaiian in Honolulu. All of these airlines share something unique. They have strong positions in major 
international gateways, and they can provide feed to a variety of airlines without adding too much cost. The revenue 
benefit is well worth it.<nl/> The situation with Ryanair and easyJet is somewhat different. Yes, they're ultra low cost 
carriers but that's not what's different. They're ultra low cost carriers that have been around a lot longer than their 
counterparts in the US so they're further along in their life cycle.<nl/> What's different is that JetBlue and Virgin 
America focus their partnering efforts on carriers abroad. Those foreign carriers can't fly domestically within the US, 
so it makes sense for them to tap into the networks of US-based airlines.<nl/> What easyJet and Ryanair are 
talking about is partnering with airlines in their own backyard. So instead of feeding American or United for their 
flights across the Pond, Ryanair and easyJet want to put people on Lufthansa, British Airways, etc.<nl/> If this 
sounds crazy, it probably is for several reasons.<nl/> 1) These airlines would have a hard time feeding each other 
considering their networks don't overlap all that much. BA's hub is Heathrow, yet there are no low cost carriers at 
Heathrow. Frankfurt? You won't see Ryanair or easyJet there. Paris/Charles de Gaulle? easyJet does fly there but 
Ryanair doesn't. This isn't necessarily for lack of trying. If low cost carriers could get slots at Heathrow, they'd be 
The Idea of Low Cost Carriers Connecting with Legacy Carriers Is Not New, But It Is for Ryanair and easyJet
there. And that could be part of the reason these airlines want to work with legacy carriers. It might help crack open 
the door.<nl/> 2) Labor would lose their minds. When JetBlue feeds an Aer Lingus flight, it's not pushing away 
passengers it would carry on its own (or vice versa). But if Ryanair puts people on British Airways, those could very 
well be people that BA could carry itself. Should BA be carrying those passengers? We can debate that, but I can 
guarantee where labor would land on that topic.<nl/> The idea, of course, is that legacy carriers could reduce their 
short haul operations and farm it out to more efficient airlines. But labor would go scorched earth if that were to 
happen. (You've seen them go nuts for much less, just look at every other week at Lufthansa and Air France.)<nl/> 
3) While the idea of interlining is great, it sounds like Ryanair wants to take absolutely no responsibility or bear any 
costs. (That's the 'twist' I was talking about.) According to the FT article, Ryanair refuses to have to deal with what 
happens if it delivers a passenger late and that person misses a connection. The way Ryanair sees it would be 
almost like an old regional airline prorate deal.<nl/> You wouldn't buy a Ryanair ticket at all. You'd buy a ticket on 
the big long haul airline and it would just include a flight on Ryanair with it. But if anything goes wrong that long haul 
airline would have to deal with it.<nl/> That arrangement seems sweet for Ryanair. The airline gets more 
passengers and has nothing else to worry about. But were I Air France, I don't think I'd be too thrilled.<nl/> I tend to 
think the best way to structure this is how GatwickConnects[2] has done it. That's a fantastic way to let the airport 
create the business of connecting airlines that don't work together. More airports should take that lead.<nl/> But a 
relationship like the one that's been envisioned in the FT article? There are a lot of hurdles to overcome.<nl/>

Jan 13, 2016( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Courtesy of 
WOW Air<nl/>This week, Icelandic budget airline WOW Air unveiled a set of new flight deals from Los Angeles 
International Airport and San Francisco International Airport: $199 one-way tickets to various destinations in 
Europe, and $99 straight to Iceland.<nl/>
 Yes, you read those numbers right.<nl/> The $199 flights have a one-hour stopover in Keflavik, Iceland, before 
allowing you to jump to 18 different cities in Europe, including London, Paris, and Berlin.<nl/> For a long-haul 
transatlantic commute, that's a steal; a quick online price check with traditional carriers shows nonstop flights for 
later this month going for $1,200 and up, and one-stop options hovering in the $700 range. With more than two 
stops on your route, you're still going to have to shell out $518.<nl/> Meanwhile, budget transatlantic air rival 
Norwegian Air is posting prices upwards of $275.<nl/> So what's the catch? WOW Air is a notorious budget carrier, 
along the lines of the Spirit, Ryanair, and Allegiant brands. They identify as part of the "ultra-low-cost long haul" 
category, in which they're shooting to become the industry leader.<nl/> Currently rated at 2.5 stars on Yelp[1], 
you're going to have to pony up[2] for traditional carrier amenities. It's $25 for an aisle seat; $10 for seat assignment 
in advance; up to $48 for an extra five inches of legroom; a $48 fee for "overweight" carry-on luggage, which means 
anything over 11 lbs.; and $67 or more for checked luggage. Reviewers also mention that in-flight refreshments are 
not free. <nl/> Still, since they launched Boston and Washington, DC low-cost routes in 2015, they've grown 
substantially, running at 90% capacity this year and expecting to double their passenger capacity this year.<nl/> 
"We have had a tremendously positive response to our low prices on our current transatlantic routes and this gives 
us confidence that passengers will take up the chance to travel even further afield," said CEO and Founder Skuli 
Mogenson in a statement posted on their site[3]. <nl/> You'll be flying in one of three new Airbus A330-300 aircraft 
that WOW purchased just for these routes, each holding up to 340 passengers. And there will be no "upgrades" to 
business class, as WOW flies single class only. <nl/> Don't get too excited about making an affordable last-minute 
escape to Europe this winter, though. A quick search shows that their $199 deals are booked out to most 
destinations through the fall of 2016. But you know what they say: Paris is always a good idea. It'll be lovely next 
October, especially for just $199.<nl/>NOW WATCH: The 10 best cities in the world, according to

this March.<nl/>
Budget airline Ryanair has announced the opening of a new base at Belfast International Airport, after an absence 
of almost six years from the city.<nl/> The company has said that 90 jobs will be created as a result of the move, 
while upwards of 750 could be created over the course of the next 18 months.<nl/> Ryanair is confident the new 
routes will bring an additional one million passengers to the airport, and will be starting a four times daily service to 
London Gatwick from this March. Five more routes are planned to operate from the airport, however the airline 
won't be unveiling these routes until October 2016.<nl/> Currently, the landing slots for Belfast flights at Gatwick are 
occupied by Aer Lingus. As part of its takeover conditions by International Airlines Group, Aer Lingus must 
relinquish the slots by March 2016.<nl/> Ryanair had left Belfast City Airport in 2010 after delays in a planned 
runway extension, which the airline had wanted in order to operate flights to more European destinations.<nl/> 'We 
are hopeful that we can introduce some new European routes of a business nature and some sunshine routes at 
much-needed lower fares,' said Ryanair's chief commercial officer David O'Brien.<nl/> Belfast International Airport 
managing director, Graham Keddie, said: 'This is a most welcome announcement. The jobs and investment are 
considerable and amount to a valuable inward investment at low or no cost to the taxpayer.'<nl/> Niall Gibbons, 
CEO of Tourism Ireland, said: 'This announcement is good news for tourism to Northern Ireland, as we kick off our 
2016 promotional drive, particularly given Ryanair's statement to introduce additional flights this autumn. We 
already work closely with Ryanair and we look forward to co-operating with them to maximise the promotion of this 
new flight from London Gatwick to Belfast.'<nl/>

Reviewing Your 2015 Predictions
Reviewing Your 2015 Predictions
The Cranky Flier

Body
Dec 31, 2015( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> It's a relatively new 
tradition here on the blog, but I like it. At the end of each year, I ask for your thoughts on the year ahead. Now, it's 
time to review how you said for your 2015 predictions[1] to see how they panned out. 
Let me first say that you have a LOT of predictions. For 2016, I'm going to limit each person to no more than 3 
predictions to help make my life easier when sifting through them all.<nl/> There were so many last year that I had 
to cut several out. Here are the ones that made the cut, in no particular order.<nl/> IAG Buying Aer Lingus and 
More<nl/>Billy - British Airways will succeed in buying a European flag carrier: they have been rebuffed by Aer 
Lingus, they will try again and also go for TAP (facing regulators)<nl/> Rzn - Aer Lingus is Bought By IAG after a 
second takeover bid between 2.40£ and 2.50£ a share, which in turn The Irish Government, Ryanair, and other 
investors quickly jump at. Still don't know how Etihad will take part.<nl/> Lauri - IAG will buy Finnair<nl/> Good 
work, Billy (and Rzn), at least on the first part. You hit that one on the nose. BA did indeed take another swing at 
Aer Lingus (well, technically, its parent IAG did). And Aer Lingus is now a member of the IAG family. TAP? That 
didn't happen. instead TAP went to JetBlue and Azul founder David Neeleman's team of investors.<nl/> As for 
Finnair… well that hasn't happened yet, Lauri. But it could still be on the table.<nl/> American's Merger 
Progresses<nl/>Len - The new American will complete the transition to a single operating certificate with little 
fanfare or hassle. Post-merger life will be better for the masses compared to the glitchy United.<nl/> Carl - The 
newly merged AA will find labor peace elusive, as pilot groups and FA groups continue to bicker while at the same 
time lusting after a greater share of the profits. The systems integration will be delayed beyond May 2015. 
Management will continue to roll out moves that irritate AA elites, and back down on some of them.<nl/> Yo - 
American Airlines makes outrageous amounts of dough, again. Pilot seniority: the US East guys lose big (I said it 
last year, but this stuff takes time). AA increases Asia services by the end of the year, going after United, Charlotte 
hub gets smaller, PHX remains the same. Doug might start looking to buy off a competitor.<nl/> IO - > aa - wraps-
up remaining labor contracts and begins to bring together tasks/systems together<nl/> Len and IO were spot on. 
The transition has been incredibly smooth for American. Carl wasn't as accurate with labor peace being somewhat 
achieved. (Though true peace is never going to happen.) Yo? Well, Charlotte didn't get smaller and Doug doesn't 
seem to be interested in buying anyone right now. There's still too much work to be done. <nl/> Revenue-Based 
Frequent Flier Programs<nl/>MeanMeosh - After being totally wrong on this last year, AA will buck the trend and 
announce that they will maintain the existing mileage-based structure of the AAdvantage program for 2016 and 
beyond, deciding that it provides a significant competitive advantage over DL and UA.<nl/> IO - > aa - It announces 
mostly tactical changes in frequent flyer and pricing areas with strategic changes being a minor component. 
Reviewing Your 2015 Predictions
meaning that changes can be done/undone easily.<nl/> Tara - AA does not adopt a revenue based mileage 
program but in the 4th quarter they release the new award charts with substantial devaluations.<nl/> Carl - UA and 
DL get more of a negative hit from the lowered dollar-based mileage earning than they expected as formerly loyal 
lower level elites favor AA, AS and even WN.<nl/> The conventional wisdom agreed with all of you, that American 
wouldn't go revenue-based in 2015 for the 2016 program. Apparently American doesn't like conventional wisdom, 
because it has done just that, proving all predictions wrong.<nl/> Meanwhile, United and Delta do not seem to have 
taken any kind of hit from their move.<nl/> American's Hub Rebanking<nl/>MeanMeosh - Speaking of AA, the hub 
rebanking strategy is left in tatters after a day of training summer thunderstorms at DFW leads to days-long delays 
for some fliers, many stranded after being diverted to alternate airports due to lack of gate space, and the resulting 
bad press.<nl/> TC99 - American will discontinue the hard banks after losing a lot of money in missed connections 
at MIA. (Hotel rooms, Transportation to/from, meals) They will try to blame Immigration and Customs for being too 
slow, but the problem is they schedule these connections. <nl/> American rebanked its hubs last year, allowing for 
more flights operating at peak times. Connections became shorter, but some of you thought the risk of things going 
wrong would be too much. It wasn't. The rebanking seems to have been successful and though American isn't 
running at the top in terms of operational performance, it is doing very well for an airline that is trying to integrate 
two different airlines into one.<nl/> Cheap Oil and Fare Wars<nl/>Len - Lower (for now) fuel prices will reduce 
pressure on bottom lines, but will not do much for fares. No more new fees for now, but the biz traveller won't be 
seeing any $99 trips anytime soon.<nl/> Jim M - With oil cheap, fares relatively high, consumer and business 
spending robust, and planes full there will be some fairly healthy profits. Which will lead someone, somewhere to 
dream up an airline start-up. And it might actually work.<nl/> Peter V - One of the big five will start a fare war in a 
tightly contested market. Fare wars are like crack to airline executives and will spread industry wide. Ticket prices 
will come down on the eastern seaboard and some transcontinental flights.<nl/> Mitch - Low oil prices will lead to 
debilitating fare wars in 2015. 2014 brought profits due to high load factors and stable fares. At least one major 
carrier will lose this restraint and try to dominate a market through crazy fares and high frequency. It is rare for the 
airline industry to show year-after-year of high profits. 2015 will see at least one major go back to the same old 
formula.<nl/> A - Oil prices will be lower than 2014 but highly volatile thus price wars will not happen and ticket 
prices remain unchanged or higher equalling solid profits across the board.<nl/> Guido - Oil prices will continue to 
drop in 2014, up until the point the domestic shale drillers throttle back production due to lack of profit, at which 
point oil shoots back up to over $90 a barrel.<nl/> Some conflicting opinions on oil here. Oil prices did indeed 
continue to drop and they have stayed very low with no rise in sight. Peter V was probably the closest to describing 
the state of the industry. Fares have come down and there have been some fare wars. But in general, airlines are 
still making a ton of money.<nl/> Alaska and Seattle<nl/>Len - I still think something will happen out west. Alaska 
has got to be feeling pretty good and make a disruptive move. I was wrong in 2014, but hey, maybe I was just a 
year early!<nl/> Carl - Surprisingly, both AS and DL both continue to prosper in SEA.<nl/> Jeremy McMillen - 
Alaska starts code sharing with UA and uses the big three to just feed its large west cost network. <nl/> PF - Delta 
downsizes domestic in Seattle.<nl/> Nick Barnard - Alaska and Delta end their codeshare and frequent flier 
partnership. Its not a huge deal as many would expect, but is announced with a joint press release.<nl/> Nick 
Barnard - Also shortly after ending the Alaska-Delta partnership Alaska and American announce a closer 
relationship. American also makes a token investment in Alaska.<nl/> CraigTPA - ALASKA - Ends partnership with 
Delta, suddenly and with much drama on Delta's part. Alaska looks for opportunities to expand relationship with 
American. By year's end AS and AA begin preliminary merger discussions (UA may kick the tires as well) - these 
are mainly window dressing to satisfy dissident shareholders and don't go very far.<nl/> IO - > AS - wonders why 
DL has not gone away and begins to explore alliance/merger partners versus expanding nationwide on their 
own.<nl/> You guys love speculating about Alaska and Seattle, and what happened? Nothing. Oh sure, the Delta 
partnership frayed further, but it's not completely gone yet. Alaska and American do seem to be getting cozier, but 
there was really little movement. Alaska just continues to kick ass.<nl/> Flying Down Under<nl/>Tara - AA also 
announces at least one route to an Australian city, probably SYD (though I would prefer BNE).<nl/> chris r - AA or 
UA will take a look at the NZ monopoly on the US-NZ route and start services DFW(AA)AKL or HOU(UA)AKL with a 
view to starting West Coast services later.<nl/> Adrian in NZ - 4. A One World or Sky Team carrier will challenge 
NZ's monopoly on NZ-US flights by flying direct to DFW or SEA. (Maybe a bit of wishful thinking as AA, CO, QF ... 
have all flown AKL to USA in the past but no longer do.)<nl/> Right on, Tara, as American announced and started 
Sydney. Adrian and chris, you were right about Auckland but wrong on the US destinations. As we know now, 
United is doing San Francisco and American is doing LA.<nl/> The Fate of Malaysia 370<nl/>Jeremy - They will find 
Reviewing Your 2015 Predictions
MH-370.<nl/> Rzn - MH370 is found I predict some wreakage on the Australian coast, but mostly either in Indonesia 
coast or near antarctica.<nl/> A - MH 370 will not be found and conspiracy theories will continue.<nl/><nl/>So who's 
right? I have no idea. Maybe part of it has been found? Maybe not. I'm still confused.<nl/> The Rise of 
United<nl/>Carl - UA will improve its operational reliability. But it will continue to lag behind DL in most polls.<nl/> 
PF - United continues to improve service ...rception, gaining back with CO had.<nl/> I'd say you summed it up well 
Carl. United has most certainly improved, but it has a ways to go before it reaches Delta level. At least it looks like 
it's finally trying after many years of sucking.<nl/> Basic Economy<nl/>MeanMeosh - DL's rollout of Basic Economy 
is a failure, primarily due to problems with disclosure on OTAs. After tens of thousands of DOT complaints, Delta 
initially shelves the idea, but brings it back by the end of the year at a substantially lower price point that the current 
$10 each way discount. I'm guessing $50.<nl/> I'd say the opposite is true here. Basic Economy has only grown 
and now we hear both American and United making rumblings about doing something similar.<nl/> The Middle East 
3<nl/>MeanMeosh - Sustained low oil prices roil the Middle Eastern carriers. At least one, my guess being Etihad, 
begins to substantially cut back service, and jettisons its interests in a handful of the money-losing carriers it has 
picked up over the past few years.<nl/> PF - The middle east big 3 (QR, EY, EK) slow down their aggressive growth 
and rightsize.<nl/> There's no question that growth has become more challenging this year compared to previous 
ones, and the results have shown that. But that doesn't mean they've slowed down. Regulatory pressure appears to 
be rising, with Europe showing interest in taking a more active stand against the Middle East carriers. But those 
orders keep coming in and those airplanes have to go somewhere.<nl/> Pilot Crunch<nl/>Eric C - The US majors, 
American in particular but also United, will discover that transferring regional aircraft from large operators to smaller 
cheaper ones doesn't mean the pilots will go with. Envoy and ExpressJet will see a pilot exodus greater than their 
shrinkage accounts for, while carriers like Trans States and PSA will find it exceedingly difficult to recruit them.<nl/> 
It's actually the bigger operators (*cough* Republic *cough) that have been having the hardest times maintaining 
their schedules. But clearly the pilot shortage is really hitting home this year, and there's no easy solution on the 
horizon in the short term.<nl/> JetBlue<nl/>CraigTPA - By year end, has a timetable to add Mint to all service 
between their major West Coast business-customer airports (SFO, LAX, LGB) and their Northeastern counterparts 
(JFK, BOS, EWR, with EWR last.) This is directly aimed at Virgin America. The Mint introduction won't be complete 
until enough A321s are on hand with a Mint cabin, but the process will be started.<nl/> IO - > B6 - begins to 
implement shareholder happy changes and stock makes big gains; however, b6 determines that aa is in the way of 
its successful implementation and asks to expand ff alliance. if aa agrees then stock continues to rise but if aa says 
no then b6 aggresively looks to merge with as to gain scale and press aa.<nl/> The JetBlue/American partnership is 
now a distant memory, and there aren't any credible rumors of a merger. But, IO, you're right that the 'shareholder 
happy' changes have been implemented. The thing is, they're 'customer happy' too. CraigTPA, you were right about 
Mint expanding, but so far it's only to Boston and on limited Caribbean routes during off-peak transcon days. I'm 
guessing there's more to come.<nl/> Southwest Bag Fees<nl/>Yo - Southwest labor issues continue, if oil goes 
back up to where it was, they will…finally start charging a nominal fee for bags.<nl/> No luck on this one, Yo. And 
honestly, it couldn't have happened anyway since Southwest's existing reservation system can't support bag fees 
anyway. But instead of just trying to wait it out, Southwest is doubling down on the no bag fee thing with its 
Transfarency campaign.<nl/> Frontier's Future<nl/>Daniel - Frontier leads U.S. airlines in DOT complaints.<nl/> PF 
- Frontier's Investors buy or sell to merge, and/or IPO.<nl/> Guido - Frontier will have difficulty getting a foothold as 
a low cost carrier, in light of the other horses in that race having such a head start. They will soldier on through 
2014 on the backs of the economic recovery but they won't see the ridiculous profits that Southwest and Spirit will 
see next year.<nl/> Frontier has certainly had a lot of complaints, Daniel, and we won't have full year stats for a 
couple more months, but thanks to Spirit, I'm thinking Frontier may escape the title.<nl/> Beyond that, Frontier has 
actually done well with its ultra low cost model and continues to push on, Guido. But, PF, you're a little premature. 
This might be better on the 2016 list.<nl/> Jetstar Hong Kong<nl/>Adrian in NZ - 1. Jetstar Hong Kong will never get 
off the ground.<nl/> Good call, Adrian. Hong Kong shot this one down and it never did go anywhere.<nl/> Spirit and 
Miami<nl/>TC99 - Spirit will expand into MIA after seeing the success that Frontier has with domestic flights. They 
will eventually add International flights to most of the cities they serve out of FLL because of the demand.<nl/> 
There has been a lot of speculation about this over the last couple years, but still nothing. From what I hear, Miami 
is just too expensive and too difficult for any low cost carrier to take a serious shot at service. Frontier's operation is 
still pretty tiny.<nl/> Another International Incident<nl/>TC99 - Finally, we will have another tragic International 
Incident involving the shooting down of a passenger plane. This will lead to a major military action to take out the 
people behind it.<nl/> I'm sad to say that I think the bombing of the Metrojet aircraft in Egypt fulfills the first part of 
Reviewing Your 2015 Predictions
this prophecy. As for a major military action, well, it depends on what you consider major. Russia has certainly 
stepped up its attacks on Daesh, but there's probably a lot more to come.<nl/> C-Series Delays<nl/>R - Bombardier 
CSeries encounters additional delays and will not be introduced in 2015.<nl/> Yes, indeed. That was the case, but 
delivery isn't far away now… we hope.<nl/> CEO Trouble<nl/>Daniel - One of the 4 major U.S. carriers' CEO 
resigns.<nl/> So define 'resign'…. It's hard to say that Smisek's disappearance at United was in any way a 
resignation since it clearly wasn't his choice. But I'll give half credit on this one.<nl/> Alitalia's Rise or 
Fall<nl/>Adrian in NZ - 7. Alitalia will morph into an LCC.<nl/> My favorite topic. Alitalia actually went in the opposite 
direction, trying to follow in Etihad's footsteps and go upscale. There is no indication that this is in any way working 
so far. Viva Alitalia!<nl/> Baltia<nl/>Daniel - Baltia Air Lines sells it's first ticket but will give the passenger a 
refund<nl/> HAHAHAHAHAHA. No. (But I admire your optimism, sir.)<nl/><nl/>If you'd like to discuss other 
predictions from last year that I didn't cover, go for it in the comments. We'll open a new post on Friday to discuss 
your

Airlines We Lost 2015
Airlines We Lost 2015

Dec 28, 2015( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> It's the end of the year, 
and you know what that means. As we do every year[1], it's time to look back and remember those airlines we lost. 
The biggest surprise is that SpiceJet is not on this list. 
It was teetering last year, but it shrunk and recapitalized so it continues to live.<nl/> Once again, I turned to Thomas 
at the excellent ch-aviation[2] site to make sure I had a complete list. Still, it's always possible something was 
missed, so feel free to leave those in the comments below.<nl/><nl/> Cyprus Airways - January 9, 2015[3]<nl/>The 
failure of Cyprus Airways is a tale as old as time. (No, not Beauty and the Beast; a different one.) Cyprus was the 
flag carrier in a small country with limited air service demand. That worked in the old days, but then low cost carriers 
invaded. There are a bunch of them in the market now from easyJet to Wizz (and Ryanair entering soon). That 
meant that there just wasn't a place for Cyprus Airways to exist. The airline is gone, but air service in Cyprus 
continues to grow. Flag carriers just aren't necessary in every country. Go ask Hungary about 
that.<nl/><nl/>Tyrolean - March 1, 2015[4]<nl/>This story always made me feel kind of dirty. Tyrolean was a 
regional airline that was bought by Austrian. But once Lufthansa Group got its claws into Austrian, it saw problems. 
Notably, Lufthansa came to the conclusion that labor costs at Austrian were too high. No agreement could be 
reached, so guess what happened? Austrian stopped flying airplanes. That's right. Tyrolean took over the entire 
fleet and operated all Austrian flights at a lower cost (using Austrian crews). Management finally got the 
concessions it wanted, so Tyrolean no longer needed to exist. Flights were transferred back to Austrian and 
Tyrolean disappeared. Dirty.<nl/><nl/>EuroLOT - March 31, 2015[5]<nl/>EuroLOT started out as a regional airline 
in Poland, and it eventually became a regional feeder for LOT itself, ultimately flying only under the LOT name. If 
that were the end of the story, then EuroLOT might still exist today. Instead, it was turned into a semi-low cost 
carrier type of operation and started flying under its own name. This was a disaster. The entire airline was such a 
mess, that the decision was made to just shut the whole thing down. That was probably the best strategy the airline 
had.<nl/><nl/>B...irlines - June 11, 2015[6]<nl/>After the Soviet Union fell apart, many Eastern European countries 
formed their own airlines, and this was one of those. It started as Air Bosna in 1994, but it eventually shut down and 
came back to life as the national carrier of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2005. The airline never did well, but at one 
point it had a lifeline thrown by Turkish Airlines. If this sounds a lot like Air Serbia and Etihad, it does… except for 
the part where Turkish realized this was a bad idea and walked away. The airline only had a couple of props to its 
name and it never prospered. Eventually the government gave up and shut it down, letting other airlines fill the (very 
tiny) void in Sarajevo.<nl/><nl/>Syphax Airlines - July 31, 2015[7]<nl/>There were such high hopes for Syphax. In 
the wake of the Arab Spring overthrow of the Tunisian government, Syphax was founded by a local businessman. 
Airlines We Lost 2015
The airline had big plans, it picked up some widebodies and even placed orders for A320neos. But the airline never 
found solid financial footing, and the Tunisian market didn't flourish as hoped. As the losses mounted, the orders 
were canceled and the airline shut down. There was word that it was going to restart with new capital, but I don't 
believe that ever actually happened. Put this into the growing pile of broken dreams in that 
region.<nl/><nl/>SkyGreece - August 27, 2015[8]<nl/>What a silly idea this was. SkyGreece was actually a 
Canadian-owned airline primarily meant to connect Greek people in Canada and the US with their homeland. The 
airline picked up a 767 and actually briefly flew to Montreal, Toronto, and New York. But as silly as the idea was, 
the execution was worse. Flights were unreliable (it used contractors which it apparently didn't like to pay) and 
within a couple months, this experiment was done. It never should have made it off the ground in the first 
place.<nl/><nl/>CanJet - September 2, 2015[9]<nl/>You might be asking yourself 'Didn't CanJet fail years ago?' 
Well yes, and no. CanJet has had nine lives, or close to it. After starting in 1999, it soon merged with Canada 3000, 
an airline that failed shortly after. It came back as an independent airline in 2002 and flew for four years until that 
didn't work. Then, it became a charter carrier. Things were looking up as it picked up some charter business and 
began to grow. Ultimately, it lost the bulk of its business, and that was that. It was finally put to sleep this 
year.<nl/><nl/>BizAir Shuttle - September 3, 2015[10]<nl/>Remember how I said SkyGreece was a silly idea? 
BizAir Shuttle makes SkyGreece look brilliant. When United Express carrier SkyWest retired its last props, it had to 
cancel service to a handful of cities including Carlsbad in North San Diego County. That was the last commercial 
service at the airport, so somebody thought there was opportunity. They took a Dornier 328JET (one of the few 
commercial jets that could operate on that short runway) and flew it to LA and Vegas. The problem in LA was that 
BizAir Shuttle had no agreements with other airlines, so it was a cumbersome process to fly anywhere beyond LA… 
and nobody wanted to just fly to LA. Demand tanked and service disappeared. I just wish I had flown the 328JET 
when I had the chance.<nl/><nl/>Korongo Airlines - September 4, 2015[11]<nl/>It might not seem surprising to hear 
about yet another failed airline in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. After all, most of them fail or crash (or 
both) at some point. But Korongo was going to be different. Brussels Airlines wanted to have a feeder operation in 
Congo for some time. (As a former colony, Congo has plenty of Belgian business interests.) After one aborted 
attempt, Korongo was founded with 70 percent owned by a Belgian consortium including Brussels Airlines. The 
airline's launch was delayed multiple times, but it did finally get airborne. Why did it fail? This is the saddest thing. It 
had an incident with the only airplane in its fleet and couldn't operate. Looking at the competitive landscape, they 
figured it best to just quit.<nl/><nl/>Virgin Atlantic Little Red - September 26, 2015[12]<nl/>2015 clearly was the 
year for many bad ideas to fail. Though to be fair, Little Red wasn't started for commercial reasons alone. When 
British Airways bought bmi, it had to divest some slots at Heathrow. Some of those were set aside to serve UK 
destinations. Virgin Atlantic thought it worth a go, so it contracted with Aer Lingus to operate Little Red flights to 
Aberdeen, Edinburgh, and Manchester. Planes were empty, fares were low, and the service hemorrhaged. 
Presumably once Delta took its stake in Virgin Atlantic, it told the airline to knock it off. So it did.<nl/><nl/>US 
Airways - October 17, 2015[13]<nl/>This has already been covered extensively, but 2015 marked the official end of 
US Airways. In reality, US Airways died in 2005 when it was days away from liquidation. America West's decision to 
step in and put together a merger was the only thing that kept US Airways going. Really, the surviving airline was 
America West, but since they kept the US Airways name, it seemed otherwise. After the American merger, it was 
only a matter of time until the US Airways name was gone. That day came on October 17 when flights were all sold 
under American's code. US Airways was an unlikely survivor and the last airline born as one of the original local 
service airlines in the US. It should be remember for that. (Just forget about all the bad stuff.)<nl/><nl/>Transaero - 
October 26, 2015[14]<nl/>When the Soviet Union fell apart, it wasn't just Eastern European countries that formed 
their own airlines. New airlines began to pop up in Russia itself to challenge Aeroflot. Transaero actually started by 
leasing airplanes from Aeroflot and was the first private scheduled carrier in Russia. It made bold moves, including 
operating Western-built aircraft early in its life. The airline grew a lot, but not in a seemingly smart way. It had a 
motley fleet with a bunch of different classes of service. As the Russian economy tanked, Transaero's past issues 
began to catch up to it. With a crushing debt load, it was forced to shut down and its fleet scattered to anyone who 
showed an interest.<nl/><nl/>Estonian Air - November 8, 2015[15]<nl/>Estonian was another one of those airlines 
that came out of the break-up of the Soviet Union, and like Air Lituanica from its neighbor Lithuania, Estonian didn't 
make it through 2015. Estonian first caught my attention in 1999 when I visited Helsinki. I didn't realize until then 
that Tallinn, the capital, was a mere 63 miles by air from Helsinki. As far as air service goes, Tallinn wasn't a huge 
market, but low cost carriers had begun to creep in as they did in Cyprus. easyJet, Norwegian, Ryanair, and 
Vueling all have a presence at the airport. There just wasn't a need for another flag carrier.<nl/><nl/>Island Airlines 
Airlines We Lost 2015
- December 11, 2015[16]<nl/>If you're like me, you probably thought this was Island Air in Hawai'i. After all, that 
airline hasn't been doing well and has struggled to find its place in the world. But Island Air keeps flying. This is 
Island Airlines, the oldest airline to fail on this year's list. It had been flying to Nantucket since 1930. The 
predecessor to Island Airlines was the first to fly into Nantucket, long before Sandpiper and Aeromass launched 
their brutal rivalry[17]. Times changed, and eventually, Island Airlines just didn't see a way to continue.<nl/>Those 
are the most notable failures this year, but as usual there were many more that I didn't feature. Here they 
are.<nl/>Tomb of the Unknown Airline<nl/> Adriatic Skyways Aerocon Air Lituanica Air Melbourne Ak Bars Aero

main indexes pared gains in midday trading Monday, as the new "Star Wars" movie failed to give Disney 
(NYSE:DIS[1]) shares any fuel. The Nasdaq, which had been up as much as 0.9%, was 0.6% higher after the 
composite came off its session lows. 
The S...00 was up 0.4% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.3%.<nl/> Volume was tracking sharply lower after 
Friday's witching session. Winning stocks led losers 8-to-5 on the NYSE and by 9-to-7 on the Nasdaq in the stock 
market today[2].<nl/> "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" made a box-office record[3] as ticket sales for the opening 
weekend topped $500 million worldwide. But that didn't help its studio.<nl/> Walt Disney fell 1% in heavy trading, 
sliding deeper below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Shares had already triggered a sell signal by falling 
more than 8% from a 117.68 buy point.<nl/> Imax (NYSE:IMAX[4]), another company expected to benefit from the 
blockbuster film, slid 3% in busy volume. It triggered a sell signal as it fell more than 8% from the 39.97 buy point of 
last week's breakout attempt.<nl/> Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY[5]) broke out of a flat base, surging past the 85.66 
buy point. But volume was tracking below average, leaving some doubts about the move. The stock was discussed 
in IBD last week[6] in a story that noted the airline's favorable travel and operating trends.<nl/> Other travel stocks 
were rallying after Stifel Nicolaus raised its price target on Carnival (NYSE:CCL[7]) to 64 from 61. On Friday, the 
cruise line operator beat earnings expectations.<nl/> Carnival shares were up 2% as they close in on the 54.69 buy

already can be considered cramped, noisy and stuffy, but things could become a great deal worse. 
A patent was recently filed by Zodiac Seats France an airline industry supplier. The patent proposes to squeeze 
even more passengers into planes by turning passengers around so they will be facing one another.<nl/> It would 
have the middle seat in each section of three be reversed meaning that passenger would be facing two other 
people during the flight.<nl/> The diagrams supplied in the patent filing show in detail that arms would intertwine, 
making for a trip that is even more intimate that currently.<nl/> Zodiac has given it the name Economy Class Cabin 
Hexagon, because of the rough shape it creates when looked at from above.<nl/> Zodiac says that along with 
increasing the density of cabin passengers, the passengers themselves would also benefit from additional shoulder 
space.<nl/> This is not any guarantee that the new formation in seating will actually come to fruition, but it is 
another example of how it could become even worse to travel aboard budget airlines.<nl/> This is not the first time 
there has been an attempt by the airline industry to squeeze more people into the economy class cabin.<nl/> 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary as showed interest previously in what are called standing seats as a method of 
lowering prices on plane tickets.<nl/> The way the new hexagon is set up there could be problems when a flight 
experiences turbulence and when someone wants to get out of their seat for whatever reason.<nl/> When the news 
of this first broke, both online and social media news showed that many people were not enthused with what might 
take place.<nl/> Tweets were very critical of the idea saying that it would make flying the discount airlines that much 
more difficult. Others questioned if the saving of having more passengers on board for the airlines was worth 
upsetting and possibly losing overall passenger count due to discontent.<nl/><nl/>This story was originally

Dec 14, 2015( Voice of America: http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex) ; Europe's travel industry could 
lose over $1 billion in revenues because of the impact of the Paris attacks, analysts say, though low oil prices and a 
recovering economy will offset security worries for the best-placed companies. Keen to benefit from the positive 
factors, investors are focusing on groups that offer a wide range of destinations, can avoid places where safety is in 
doubt, and have robust enough finances to absorb potential shocks.
 "Big companies may be better prepared because they have more ... and further destinations that will be tempering 
the losses," said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, market analyst at London Capital Group. The full impact of the Nov. 13 
attacks that killed 130 people in Paris will become clearer with fourth-quarter results, but there is already evidence 
of a significant hit to Europe's tourism industry, worth $500 billion according to the U.N.'s World Tourism 
Organization. Hotel revenues in Paris are down 30-40 percent from last year's levels, restaurant revenues have 
fallen by a similar margin while new flight bookings to Paris fell by 27 percent in the week following the attacks. That 
cost Air France KLM 50 million euros ($55 million), while British bus and train operator Stagecoach last week issued 
a profit warning because of customer fears about trips to big cities. "I suspect that we're going to see a little bit more 
of a lingering impact for the travel industry," said Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index. Analysts who spoke to 
Reuters gave estimates of the total revenue hit on Europe's travel and tourism sectors from the Paris attacks 
ranging from 800 million euros to well over 1 billion euros. With the political and security situation still volatile in 
many parts of the Middle East and major Western countries on high alert for further Islamist attacks, safety fears will 
continue to hang over the sector for the foreseeable future. "It can get worse when, instead of having one event, 
you are starting to have a series of events, because people then feel very insecure," said Daniele Patti, senior 
research analyst at Allianz Global Investors. On the positive side, analysts cited tour operator TUI, cruise operator 
Carnival, online holiday retailer On The Beach Group, Ryanair and British Airways parent IAG as being able to 
weather the storm. TUI, the world's largest tour operator, said on Thursday it was confident of increasing earnings 
by more than 10 percent this year, as it switched out of Egypt and Tunisia to focus on the Canary Islands and 
Cyprus instead. With ships seen as less likely to be targeted in attacks, Carnival was cited as a good bet in the 
current context, while On The Beach Group could benefit from its focus on destinations like Spain, Portugal and the 
Canaries. Airlines are also attractive as they are trading at a discount to the market, with Ryanair and IAG's price-
to-earnings ratios at 13 and 11.5 respectively, compared with an average of 16.6 on the STOXX Europe 600 index 
and 16.4 on the UK FTSE 100 index. Oil is a key factor for airlines, with analysts estimating that a dollar drop in the 
oil price added between 10 and 15 pence (15 to 23 cents) to their share prices last year. ($1 = 0.9129 euros) ($1 = 
0.6592 pounds)

Stocks rocketed higher going into the noon hour Friday, ignited by a better-than-expected jobs report that seemed 
to cement the deal for an interest rate hike on Dec. 16.<nl/>
 The Nasdaq gained 1.3% to trade near its session highs, while the S...00 and the Dow Jones industrial average 
gained 1.1% each in the stock market today[1]. The small-cap Russell 2000 trailed with a 0.8% gain.<nl/> Volume 
was running higher on the Nasdaq exchange.<nl/> The Labor Department said nonfarm payrolls rose 211,000 in 
November vs. estimates of 190,000. The October number was revised upward to 298,000 from 271,000. The 
unemployment rate held steady at 5%.<nl/> The CME Group FedWatch Tool[2] shows futures traders are firmly 
convinced the Fed will raise the fed funds rate — the interest that banks pay on overnight loans — during the 
central bank's Dec. 15-16 meeting. The traders currently are pricing in a 79% chance of a hike to 0.5% from the 
current range of 0 to 0.25%, which has held since December 2008.<nl/> After Thursday's tumultuous day, triggered 
by a milder-than-expected stimulus by the European Central Bank, oil was lower, the dollar higher and the euro 
lower. Treasury yields also declined.<nl/> Among IBD 50 stocks, 46 were higher and four were lower. The best 
performer was Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA[3]), which turned heads[4] with a better-than-expected earnings report 
after the close Thursday. It rose 10% in heavy volume, breaking out of a ragged base with a 175.88 buy point.<nl/> 
NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES[5]), another IBD 50 name, rose 5% to a new high. It's now extended 15% from a cup-
base breakout at 154.98; the Chinese game software and Internet content firm initially broke out of that base Nov. 
12.<nl/> Airlines were among the top-performing industry groups, up 2.8%. Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK[6]) rose nearly 
4%, completing a breakout from a late-stage flat base. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV[7]) is also ascending from a 
base, up nearly 3%. Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY[8]) was up 2.6%.<nl/> [ 1]: http://www.investors.com/stock-market-

The abolition of the €3 Airport Tax in April 2014 led to the announcement of new transatlantic routes from both 
Dublin and Shannon airports by Aer Lingus, and increasing frequency of services on existing routes. This fed 
expansion of Aer Lingus Regional, which also expanded its operations at Cork Airport by 25% in order to cope with 
increasing numbers of UK travellers to Ireland. Ryanair responded by announcing several new continental 
destinations, along with increased traffic on existing...<nl/><nl/>For more information on the "Airlines in Ireland"

Dec 02, 2015( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ;;<nl/> Peter 
Barreras/AP<nl/>Good morning. Here's everything you need to know in the world of advertising today.<nl/>
 1. Yahoo's board is reportedly going to consider a potential sale of its internet business when it meets later this 
week.[1] Among the potential buyers expected to take a look at Yahoo's business are private-equity shops.<nl/> 2. 
Budget airline Ryanair is taking Google to the high court over alleged "misleading and deceptive" online 
ads.[2] Ryanair is complaining about the way an unaffiliated "screenscraper" website called eDreams, which it 
claims masquerades as its brand, is promoted right at the top of Google's search engine listings.<nl/> 3. New York 
City-headquartered ad tech startup Undertone has been acquired by Israeli marketing software company Perion in 
an all-cash deal worth $180 million.[3] Perion will now have a bigger presence in the US and combined the two 
companies are estimated to generate $350 million in net revenue this year.<nl/> 4. French-based publicly-listed ad 
tech company Criteo has joined the list of firms that pay Adblock Plus to appear on its "Acceptable Ads" list.[4] Two 
types of Criteo ads are now whitelisted.<nl/> 5. Microsoft employees sang carols outside Apple's flagship store for a 
Christmas commercial.[5] The video, posted on YouTube, shows Microsoft's New York City store employees 
performing a version of "Let There Be Peace On Earth" outside the Fifth Avenue Apple Store.<nl/> 6. Even Adobe 
wants everyone to quit using Flash.[6] The company is encouraging users to make animations in HTML 5 instead 
and it has rebranded Flash Professional CC to Animate Professional CC.<nl/> 7. Kate Hudson's workout brand is 
mocking Lululemon.[7] Fabletics has posted two videos to YouTube that seem to directly mock the extremely 
popular athleisure brand.<nl/> 8. GE's odd "What's the Matter with Owen" commercials are working like a charm, it 
says.[8] The TV commercials have been turning heads among the target recruits, college grads, says Tony 
Denhart, University Relations Leader at GE Corporate and Andy Goldberg, GE's Chief Creative Officer.<nl/> 9. 
Mark Zuckerberg said he is giving away 99% of his shares in Facebook during his lifetime to help initiatives that 
"advance human potential and promote equality."[9] That equals around $45 billion today.<nl/> 10. World Cup 
sponsors Adidas, Coca-Cola, Visa, McDonald's, and AB InBev have written to FIFA's executive committee calling 
for "independent oversight" of the governing body's reform process, AP reports.[10] The competition's other lead 
sponsors, Hyundai and Gazprom, are not signatories on the letter.<nl/>NOW WATCH: This Chipotle hack lets you

Stocks wobbled in and out of gains and losses early Wednesday, as company news[1] and mixed economic reports 
powered the bulk of early trade.<nl/> The Nasdaq held steady with a 0.2% gain. 
The Dow Jones industrial average and the S...00 each logged 0.1% declines. The small-cap Russell 2000 clung to 
a fractional gain.<nl/> Volume was mixed at the start of trade, up 19% on the Nasdaq and 13% lower on the NYSE, 
vs. activity at the same time Tuesday.<nl/> Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO[2]) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM[3]) were 
the opening stories in the stock market today[4], with Qualcomm up 8% on a patent royalty deal in China and 
Yahoo jumping 4% on news that it may spin off not one, but two units into separately traded entities.<nl/> A heavy 
lineup of speeches form Federal Reserve officials, including two speeches from Chief Janet Yellen, could figure in 
the day's trade as investors attempt to divine how the central bank will proceed with a possible policy shift at its 
Dec. 15-16 meeting. The Fed's beige book report for December is due out at 2 p.m. ET.<nl/> Private employers 
added 217,000 workers in November, according to the ADP national employment report. Economists had forecast 
183,000 added jobs. Nearly all of the hirings were among service sector employers.<nl/> Oil prices swung nearly 
2% lower, but with West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude holding within their recent trading ranges, ahead of 
the Energy Information Administration's weekly stockpiles report, due out at 10:30 a.m.<nl/> Logistics leader C.H. 
Robinson (NASDAQ:CHRW[5]) dived almost 7%, the worst showing among S...00 stocks.<nl/> Airlines staged an 
early rally after Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL[6]) reported a surprise gain in monthly per passenger revenue in 
November. Delta, United Continental (NYSE:UAL[7]) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL[8]) were all up nearly 
3%. JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU[9]), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV[10]) and Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY[11]) gained 
2% apiece.<nl/> Among IBD 50 stocks, Hawaiian (NASDAQ:HA[12]) jumped 4%, Alaska Air (NASDAQ:AAL[13]) 
took a 1% gain.<nl/> Hawaiian's gain left shares just below its Nov. 6 high as the stock works on the fourth week in 
a flat consolidation. The airline triggered an eight-week hold rule on Oct. 19, rising more than 20% above a 25.69 
buy point in less than two weeks.<nl/> IBD 50 peer AMN Healthcare Services (NYSE:AHS[14]) popped almost 3% 
at the open. The medical staffing agency is up 32% from a late October low, climbing the right side of a deep, two-
month consolidation.<nl/> Retailers and apparel makers will make a showing in a busy after-hours session 
Wednesday, with quarterly reports due out from PVH (NYSE:PVH[15]), American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO[16]) 
and Aeropostale (NYSE:ARO[17]), as well as from chipmaker Avago Technologies (NASDAQ:AVGO[18]).<nl/> 
Overseas, Europe's markets were a bit more broadly mixed near midday than U.S. stocks, ahead of the European 
Central Bank's key policy vote due out there Thursday. China's markets rose, with the Shanghai Composite jumping 
2.3% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index ending up 0.4%.<nl/> [ 1]: http://news.investors.com/investing.aspx [ 2]:

misleading customers and not offering the best deal.

preferential placement but with a yellow sign to indicate that the ads are sponsored.<nl/> "Ryanair has engaged in 
several legal cases across Europe against screenscraper websites such as eDreams to prevent consumers from 
being deceived and subjected to false prices and hidden charges," the Irish company said in a statement.<nl/>

Skyscanner Reveals the Hot Destinations for 2016
Skyscanner Reveals the Hot Destinations for 2016

Nov 27, 2015( Pressat: http://www.pressat.co.uk Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Friday 27 November, 2015<nl/> 
Global travel search engine Skyscanner has released its predictions for the hot spots to watch in 2016. These 
destinations range from the new set of all-inclusive destinations like Cape Verde to the more intrepid destinations, 
such as the Azores.<nl/>
The predictions are based on the analysis of millions of Skyscanner flight searches from the last three years, 
combined with qualitative research carried out by our team of travel experts.<nl/>The top five hot spots for 2016 
(based on percentage increase in searches from the UK over the last three years*):<nl/>1. Ponta Delgada (the 
Azores) - 63%With more airlines flying to the Azores, including Ryanair's new weekly flight from Stansted to Ponta 
Delgada, this autonomous region of Portugal is opening up as a viable budget travel destination and is therefore 
experiencing a tourism boom. With excellent hiking, whale watching, surfing and diving, the Azores is likely to 
feature heavily on adventure travellers' bucket lists in 2016. <nl/>2. Havana (Cuba) - 33%After years in the cold, 
Cuba is back on the world stage as the USA restored diplomatic relations in July and continues to loosen 
restrictions on trade. If more restrictions are lifted we may see flights from the US and US hotel chains opening in 
Cuba in 2016. Many are therefore booking flights to Cuba to experience the country before it changes beyond 
recognition (and before prices rise as a result). Having been shut off for so long Cuba is trapped in a time warp, with 
crumbing colonial buildings and 1950s cars. It is like nowhere else on earth.<nl/>3. Tokyo (Japan) - 25%Tourism 
has boomed under the current prime minister's administration. The national tourist board are actively targeting 
niche UK markets by focusing on ski, honeymoon and adventure tourism offerings. Thanks to the excellent value 
Japan Rail Passes and Airbnb type accommodation, Tokyo is now 50% cheaper for UK travellers than in 2013 
according to the Post Office's Long Haul Report.<nl/>What's more, Japan will host the 2020 Olympics and the 2019 
Rugby World Cup so attention will only increase throughout 2016. Hokkaido's first Shinkansen high speed train will 
also launch in 2016, opening up more of Japan to visitors.<nl/>4. Copenhagen (Denmark) - 21%Recently voted the 
ninth most reputable city in the world, Copenhagen is a must visit for culture vultures and foodies alike. Home to the 
five-month long Tivoli Festival (May - September 2016), classical music fans can expect a star-studded line up 
hosted at the stunning Tivoli Gardens.<nl/>February is also a great time to visit the capital, with the Copenhagen 
Cooking festival showcasing ever-increasingly popular Nordic cuisine, whilst fashionistas can immerse themselves 
in Copenhagen's Fashion Week, the largest of its kind in Northern Europe. <nl/>5. Sal (Cape Verde) - 14%With a 
reputation for unspoilt beaches and cobbled streets, the island of Sal is only just emerging as a tourist destination. 
Thomson Airways is adding to its portfolio with a new route from Bristol in summer 2016. What's more, with chart 
topping acts and reality stars frequenting these West Africa isles Skyscanner predicts the destination's popularity 
Skyscanner Reveals the Hot Destinations for 2016
will continue to rise. Sal is also a great base for exploring the rest of the archipelago, from the canyons, gorges and

Stock futures bobbed in narrowly positive territory ahead of Friday's open, as the market prepared for a short post-
holiday trading session. Dow futures traded 14.6 points above fair market value and had halved their gains over the 
prior hour.<nl/>
<nl/>Nasdaq 100 futures doubled their hour-earlier gains to 18 points. S...00 futures were steady, showing a 3.6-
point gain.<nl/> The small-cap S...00 starts Friday with a 1.6% gain and just back above its 200-day line. The 
broader Russell 2000 has climbed a shade less than 2% since Monday, but is still well below its 200-day level.<nl/> 
Premarket action was subdued among most Dow and S...00 stocks. Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS[1]) dropped nearly 
2%, the Dow's biggest move and the largest loss among S...00 companies. A regulatory filing late Wednesday 
showed Disney's profitable ESPN franchise had lost 3 million subscribers from the start of 2015 through October, 
putting the channel's two-year subscriber loss at 7 million.<nl/> Citigroup (NYSE:C[2]), Xerox (NYSE:XRX[3]) and 
Target (NYSE:TGT[4]) led the S...00 before the open with gains of just over 1%.<nl/> China-based issues were 
seeing some selling pressure after a tough day in China's markets.<nl/> Online retailer JD.com (NASDAQ:JD[5]) 
dropped more than 3%, marking the widest loss among Nasdaq 100 companies. The stock ended Wednesday in a 
struggle to hold support at its 10-week moving average as it attempts to build the right side of a five-month cup 
base.<nl/> On the IBD 50 list, premarket gains held to less than 1%. China-based social networking platform YY 
(NASDAQ:YY[6]) fell more than 2% to the bottom of the list. The stock is also working to climb the right side of a 
five-month consolidation.<nl/> On IBD's Your Weekly Review list, Ireland-based Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY[7]) 
popped 2% before the open. The budget airline tripped two sell signals on Tuesday, falling below its 10-week line in 
strong trade and undercutting a flat-base buy point of 82.81 by more than 7%.<nl/> Overseas, China's markets 
careened lower, with the Shanghai Composite diving 5.5% Friday and Hong Kong's Hang Seng down 1.9%. 
Investors were apparently raising cash ahead of next week's re-entry of IPOs to the Chinese markets and reacting 
to news[8] late Thursday that regulators were investigating the country's largest brokerage firm. Shanghai ended 
the week down 5.3%. Hong Kong took a 3% loss.<nl/> In Japan, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 trimmed off 0.3% Friday to 
post a flat finish to the week.<nl/> Europe's markets were flat, with the leading benchmark indexes trading within 
0.1% of their starting points at midsession on Friday.<nl/> [ 1]: http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-walt-

Nov 20, 2015( Adrian Swinscoe - RARE Business Growth ...rketing: http://www.adrianswinscoe.com/blog/ Delivered 
by Newstex) ;;<nl/> Podcast: Play in new window[1] | Download[2]<nl/><nl/>Today's interview is with Rory 
Sutherland who is Vice-Chairman, Ogilvy ...ther UK[3] and co-founder of #ogilvychange[4]. The Ogilvy ...ther Group 
UK is made up of 10 companies that work across a range of marketing disciplines. #ogilvychange is their specialist 
behavioural science practice that uses the latest thinking in cognitive psychology, social psychology and 
behavioural economics to help their clients create behavioural change in the real world.<nl/>
<nl/>Rory is a leading thinker in the marketing and advertising space and a huge proponent of how the application 
of insights from cognitive psychology and behavioural economics can positively impact business and customers. As 
a result, Rory joins me today to talk about behavioural economics, psychology, customer experience, the big impact 
that small changes can have and what business can and should be learning and doing with these insights.<nl/> 
This interview follows on from my recent interview - How to enhance, extend and crowd source your in-field 
customer service - Interview with Manuel Grenacher of Mila[5] - and is number 159 in the series of interviews[6] 
with authors and business leaders that are doing great things, helping businesses innovate and delivering great 
service and experience to their customers.<nl/> Note: The interview was recorded at The Grand in Brighton and so 
there is some background noise. However, it doesn't spoil the recording and you can still hear our conversation just 
fine. Enjoy.<nl/> Highlights of my interview with Rory:<nl/>Rory has worked in advertising for about 27 years and 
started in direct marketing, which he believes is a very good place to start as it is like a self funding behavioural 
science experiment as you get to test different creative approaches and you see what happens. After 'discovering' 
economics he found that economists view of human behaviour was naive in the extreme. Thus, he became an early 
convert to and evangelist of behavioural science. He describes himself as a behavioural science impresario. He 
established #ogilvychange where they help private, public and charitable clients harness the power and insights of 
behavioural science. When people think about behavioural science these days they often think that it is all about 
finding 'nudges'. But, in fact, their first job is their work is to remove 'anti-nudges' i.e. little things that stop people 
from doing certain things or feeling comfortable about taking on a new action (like the concept of 'grit'[7] that I have 
talked about before). An example Rory cites is when you go to a posh hotel it is considered mandatory that even 
before you have checked in that someone offers to take your bags. However, most people hate this as they have 
just spent hours traveling on a plane and going through airports thinking 'don't forget my luggage, don't lose my 
luggage, where's my luggage etc etc'. So, when they are presented with a complete stranger offering to take their 
Behavioural science, customer experience and why we should test more things - Interview with Rory 
Sutherland of #ogilvychange
bags from them their unconscious brains very negatively to this. Most hotels think that this is adding service. But, to 
many people it is the last thing they need or want before they have even checked in or know their room number. 
Behavioural science has enormous economic value simply through creating uncertainty about conventional 
economics. The pervasiveness of assumptions and beliefs in business and economics like efficiency is the greatest 
god, price reduction is the best thing that you can do for a consumer and that value is intrinsic in the thing that you 
do and not in the perception of that thing reduces the bio-diversity in the world of business beliefs. As a result, this 
makes business worse as it tends to make everyone the same and reduces the number of people and businesses 
that strive for difference. Moreover, businesses can believe different things and both be right. Just look at Lidl and 
Waitrose. Dissident opinion judged by the market has very interesting outcomes. To some extent, Easyjet wouldn't 
be nearly as good if it wasn't for Ryanair and British Airways arguably needs low-cost airlines to justify high-cost 
flying. The idea that there is one-truth is something that we have to fight. Behavioural science, at the very least, 
creates debate around what people really want and how that changes over time i.e. consider what we want from an 
airport now and what we wanted from an airport in 1997. Truth varies from person to person and over time. 
Reminded me of a funny Billy Connolly sketch about demands from the women's movement.[8] Small things can 
very big effects. Rory cites an example of going to Wagamama, a restaurant, where as you enter the restaurant 
they explain what happens and why it happens. This is hugely important in setting expectations and the frame in 
which service is delivered. The whole experience would be completely different if this wasn't done. With a bit of 
contextual framing you can make something that is rubbish appear brilliant. The addition of a tiny little nudge at the 
right place and time in an experience can make a huge difference. The Peak End Rule is worth knowing as it is a 
phenomena where 'people judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak (i.e., its most intense 
point) and at its end, rather than based on the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.'[9] Another 
phenomena that is worth paying attention to is the Von Restorff spike[10], which is our propensity to notice and 
remember anything that stands out or is unusual (good or bad) and how that influences our perception of everything 
else we have experienced. An example of these things in practice can be seen in hotels where if you have a good 
check-in experience you will go around looking for other evidence to corroborate your perception. The converse, of 
course, is true too. The Kano effect[11] is another interesting phenomena that is worth paying attention to. It 
originates from Professor Noriaki Kano[12] who found that different product attributes will produce no delight if 
present but infuriation if absent. Moreover, other features may produce insane delight but be completely tangential 
to the service or product being provided. The idea that you can improve business by completely removing human 
agency is deranged. The reasons that we do things and the reasons we react to things are not well described by 
the explanations we give. Because we don't really understand what generates emotional stress in us then we often 
misrepresent the elements of the problem that annoys us. Thoughts are much less important than feelings when it 
comes to determining human behaviour. Feelings are probably better than rationality at synthesising multiple 
sources of information in different contexts. Mass market players like Costa Coffee, Starbucks, Travelodge etc etc 
have made it possible for the independent sector to do much better because they have helped eliminate the worst 
50% of independent coffee shops and hotels by setting the base standard so high. Check out Rory's TED talk 
'Sweat 
The 
Small 
Stuff[13]'. 
Below 
is 
one 
of 
the 
diagrams 
he 
uses 
in 
his 
talk:<nl/>http://ericlanke.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/chief-detail-officer.html;<nl/>In his talk he advocates for the 
creation of a new position called the Chief Detail Officer, who has lots of power and influence but no budget. 
However, one of the challenges in corporate environments is that many of the details or small things are dismissed 
as trivial but yet those little things could be the thing that delivers the Von Restorff spike[14] that businesses crave 
and define the customer experience.<nl/>Rory is a big fan of board level Chief Customer Officers and/or Chief 
Experience Officers and was delighted to see that British Airways have now appointed a Chief Experience Officer 
who sits on their board but also that he has come from the hotel industry and not the airline industry. TripAdvisor 
adds a lot of value to cafes and restaurants in terms of framing and positioning. For example, if a restaurant serves 
great food but the service is generally rated as being a bit flaky and you read a review to that effect then that sets 
the expectation of what to expect. Therefore, if you go and the food is great and the service is a bit flaky then the 
place has met your expectations. However, if the service is better than you expect then you will tend to be surprised 
and delighted. We like things that we have chosen more than things that are imposed on us. That's why we like 
seat 17A on an airplane more if we have chosen it than if it was randomly allocated to us. Knowing these things and 
using them can help make people happier and not destroy value through bad framing or presentation. Ludwig von 
Mises[15] and the Austrian School of Economics understood this best where they believed that economics should 
Behavioural science, customer experience and why we should test more things - Interview with Rory 
Sutherland of #ogilvychange
be a subordinate discipline to psychology or Praxeology[16], 'the deductive study of human action'. We use our 
judgement of things we do understand as proxies to help us judge things that we do not understand. Satisficing[17] 
is worth paying attention to too as it is a decision-making strategy that means that rather looking for the optimal 
solution we look through the available alternatives until some level of acceptability is reached and we choose that 
option. One of the things that rationalists, intrinsicists, intellectuals and economists get wrong is their predictions 
about how online retail is going to be a bigger proportion of retail in 20 years time than it will be. The reason being is 
that they ignore the context within which many things are bought and also how the choices that customers make 
really appear in the brain as opposed to how they do in a very simplified model. To get started learning about all of 
this stuff, Rory recommends reading a few books including Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow[18], Cass 
Sunstein and Richard Thaler's Nudge[19] as well as Ben Goldacre and Stuart Sutherland's Irrationality[20] and 
Robert Frank's The Darwin Economy[21]. Be less sure. Most things in human behaviour aren't hard and fast rules. 
So, the best thing business can do is have a wider Overton Window[22] of what is possible and, therefore, they 
should test more things. The thing that Rory wants to plug comes from one of their clients and is the Philips 
Airfryer[23], which, he says, is a tremendous product that cooks great food through the use of superheated air and 
very little to no fat. The product sells very well in Asia because in Asia 'frying' is synonymous with cooking. 
However, it doesn't sell so well in the UK because 'frying' is associated with unhealthy eating and so it isn't 
positioned well in the mind of customers. But, the ironic thing is that it is a very healthy way of cooking and when 
people buy one they love it. So, Rory says buy one and he'll be amazed if you are disappointed. Mentally the 
product hasn't been framed in the way that helps UK customers buy it.<nl/>About Rory (taken and adapted from his 
Ogilvy Change bio)<nl/> Rory Sutherland is the Vice-Chairman, Ogilvy ...ther UK[24] and co-founder of 
#ogilvychange[25].<nl/> In 2012 Sutherland was awarded a prestigious 25th anniversary IDM Honorary Fellowship 
at the Institute's flagship event, the IDM Annual Lecture. Rory received the IDM's only 2012 Honorary Fellowship 
award for his outstanding contribution to the direct and digital marketing profession.<nl/> With the discovery of 
behavioural economics, Rory found that it was a serious academic discipline that can positively impact 
business.<nl/> He shares lots of behavioural insights and other observations with his TED talks[26], through writing 
The Spectator's 'Wiki Man' column[27] and his busy Twitter account @rorysutherland[28] (Do say Hello!).<nl/> <nl/>

With just 39 days to go until Christmas, airports across the UK are warming up to transport millions of passengers 
across the globe for the festive season. Airport Parking ...tels (APH) has therefore put together a guide comparing 
the different airline policies for travelling with Christmas and New Year favourites such as Christmas crackers, gifts 
and party poppers, ensuring there are no hold-ups at the check-in desk. The research can be found in the Know 
Before You Go section of the APH website at            www.aph.com/christmascrackers.<nl/>
The research compares 14 airlines including Delta Air Lines, Monarch and Virgin Atlantic and compares their 
policies for carrying festive treats such as Christmas crackers, party poppers, sparklers and gifts as both hold and 
checked luggage. <nl/>For those not wanting to miss out on pulling a cracker abroad this Christmas, only two out of 
the 14 airlines in the study allow passengers to travel with crackers in their hand luggage including bmi regional and 
easyJet. Both of these airlines stipulated that the crackers must remain within their original packaging, with bmi 
regional restricting travellers to one box person whereas easyJet permits two boxes per traveller.<nl/>Passengers 
are more likely to be able to travel with crackers in their checked luggage, with eight of the surveyed airlines 
permitting crackers to be packed in the hold compartment. However, many of these airlines impose strict policies, 
for example Emirates state that permission must be granted by the airline at least three days before travel and 
easyJet make it compulsory that passengers inform check-in staff if they are carrying crackers. The strictest airlines 
in the survey include Delta Air Lines, KLM, Ryanair, Aer Lingus and Air France, all of whom do not permit Christmas 
crackers, sparklers and party poppers to be carried onboard.<nl/>When it comes to travelling with presents, Ryanair 
and British Airways both stipulate that presents must not be wrapped to allow security staff to access the parcels if 
necessary. Passengers flying with bmi regional must also note that Christmas trees and foliage are not 
recommended to be carried as checked luggage.<nl/>Passengers should also be reminded that strict restrictions 
apply across all airlines when it comes to carrying liquids in hand luggage, whereby liquids over 100ml are still not 
permitted. If travellers wish to carry festive favourites such as cranberry sauce or port, bottles over 100ml should be 
carried as part of checked luggage. <nl/>For further information on Airport Parking and Hotels (APH),Visit

futures fell 5 points vs. fair value, and S...00 futures lost a point. 
Futures on the Dow Jones industrial average gave up 12 points.<nl/> The stock market ended a six-week winning 
streak last week amid a pickup in distribution days, which prompted a downgrade of the market outlook[2].<nl/> 
Stock markets overseas were mixed. In Europe, France's CAC-40 slipped 0.2% after Friday's series of attacks by

Lufthansa strike takes off after court ruling
Lufthansa strike takes off after court ruling

Nov 11, 2015( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> A German court has 
struck down a Lufthansa injunction aimed at ending a walkout by the airline's cabin crew, setting the stage for a 
nasty battle that could see thousands more flights being cancelled in the days ahead. 
A labor court in Dusseldorf, Germany, ruled on Wednesday that cabin crew union UFO must be allowed to continue 
its industrial action at the German carrier at least until Friday. The court followed a similar ruling by the labor court in 
Darmstadt earlier in the day, which has jurisdiction for Frankfurt and Munich airports.<nl/> Lufthansa had sought to 
challenge the legality of the industrial action through court injunctions claiming the union's reasons for striking were 
"too vague" and unjustified under German labor law. The Dusseldorf court, however, dismissed the claim saying 
UFO's aims were "sufficiently clear" and "not exaggerated."<nl/> The UFO union welcomed the ruling on its 
website, calling for the strike to continue from 0300 GMT on Wednesday until 2300 GMT on Friday across all flights 
at Frankfurt, Munich and Dusseldorf airports.<nl/> Lufthansa grounded<nl/> The new flight cancellations come after 
four days of stoppages that have already forced the airline to cancel 2,800 flights, leaving 330,000 passengers 
stranded. On Wednesday alone, Lufthansa was forced to scrap 930 flights, grounding 100,000 passengers. For 
Thursday, the airline plans to cancel 933 flights, affecting a total of 107,000 passengers.<nl/> Lufthansa and UFO 
have been locked in a battle for nearly two years, in which management has sought to change early retirement 
provisions for their cabin crews. While UFO wants them to remain unchanged, Lufthansa argues that the system is 
too expensive in the face of cut-throat competition from low-cost operators such as Ryanair and Easyjet. <nl/> 
Entrenched positions<nl/> On Monday, the airline presented a new offer to the union, with improved bonuses and 
retirement provisions, but UFO called it unacceptable.<nl/> In a statement issued on Wednesday, the airlines chief 
executive (CEO) Carsten Spohr said Lufthansa could not endanger its future by ceding to the union's demands. He 
added that the dispute would run for "as long as necessary," even though he admitted that "each day of strike is 
one too many."<nl/> Spohr also called on UFO to allow an independent arbiter to find a solution in the dispute - an 
offer which union boss Nicoley Baublies ruled out for the duration of the strike.<nl/> Earlier this year, the German 
carrier was already hit by a dispute with its pilots over early retirement payments. The pilots were also concerned 
about management plans to expand the airline's low-cost activities and staged a series of walkouts that cost 
Lufthansa 350 million euros ($375 million). The pilots' strike was finally stopped by a German court which argued 
the union demands were not clearly linked to wage issues and working conditions.<nl/> uhe/hch (dpa, AFP,

Nov 09, 2015( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Discount 
supermarkets Aldi and Lidl have been named the world's top brands for giving customers a simple, clear and 
hassle-free shopping experience.<nl/>
<nl/> Aldi topped the annual Global Brand Simplicity Index from US-based brand consultancy Siegel ...le for the 
sixth year in a row, reports The Telegraph[1].<nl/><nl/> The index polled 12,000 people and ranked 87 brands 
worldwide in order of the clarity and simplicity of their products and the way they communicate with 
shoppers.<nl/><nl/> Aldi and its counterpart Lidl, which took third place, were praised for expanding their range of 
products their and strongly-communicated 'money-saving' messages. Google took second place in the list.<nl/> 
Siegel ...le said 63pc of consumers are willing to pay more for a simple retail experience, making it ironic that the list 
is constistently topped by the budget supermarket chains. More than half of adults in the UK now visit an Aldi or Lidl 
each year.[2]<nl/> 'Brands that offer simpler customer experiences are rewarded with passionate customer loyalty, 
more innovative employees and greater revenue. In short, embracing simplicity improves the bottom line for brands 
and organisations,' said Howard Belk of Siegel ...le.<nl/> Aldi has topped a number of brand surveys in recent 
years. Earlier this year, its brand value surpassed that of Tesco for the first time, reflecting consumers' growing 
preference for smaller, discount stores, according to WPP and Millward Brown's annual BrandZ report.<nl/> BrandZ 
calculated Aldi's brand value as $11.7m compared to Tesco's $9.4m.<nl/> Netflix, which is now focusing on original 
feature films and TV series, took fourth place in Siegel ...le's list.<nl/> Fast food chains McDonald's, Burger King 
and KFC also made the top 10, appealing to a wide range of consumers.<nl/> Banks and insurance companies 
dominated the bottom 10. Ryanair was ranked third from last, despite its recent attempts to be more 'cuddly'.<nl/> [

Lufthansa strike keeps passengers on the ground and in the dark
Lufthansa strike keeps passengers on the ground and in the dark

Nov 06, 2015( Deutsche Welle Germany: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/germany/s-1432 Delivered by Newstex) 
<nl/> The striking cabin crew union's strategic secrecy has surprised throngs of customers and led Lufthansa to 
prepare for the worst. Jeffrey Michels reports from the Frankfurt Airport. 
Lufthansa is no stranger to strikes - its pilots halted service ten times in 2014 alone. But the cabin crew strike 
starting today portends to open a new chapter in the airlines' attempt to stay competitive at the expense of its 
workers.<nl/> <nl/> UFO, the Independent Flight Attendants Union, has kept quiet and continued to negotiate 
changes to its members' benefits while the pilots repeatedly went on strike. Yet after two years of frustration, its 
19,000 workers are taking to the picket line, too, in what has the potential to be the largest and longest strike in the 
company's history.<nl/> It certainly didn't seem like it could be, though.<nl/> At the Frankfurt Airport, where 
Lufthansa runs its largest number of flights, the terminal was calm. The departure board reported no cancellations. 
No one was panicking at any of the hundreds of Lufthansa counters.<nl/> This is because UFO is employing an 
interesting tactic in its strike - keeping its plans secret for as long as possible. The strike was announced Monday, 
declared officially yesterday, and given a general outline - listing only which airports, not which flights would be 
affected - this morning, only six hours before it was to come into effect.<nl/> As Lufthansa doesn't know which 
flights will be grounded, it must prepare for all of them to be.<nl/> 'All Lufthansa passengers therefore must expect 
that their flight could be cancelled on short notice,' union chief Nicolay Baublies explained.<nl/> To fly or not to fly 
<nl/> Today's confusion begins at the Lufthansa check-in counter. I ask a worker if he knows which flights will be 
canceled. 'Yes,' he says, confidently briefed, 'flights after 14:00.' Every flight? He hesitates. 'I'm not sure.' I ask him 
what is he expecting today? Again: 'I'm not sure.'<nl/> The yellow word 'annuliert' - cancelled - began trickling onto 
the flight board a little after 11:00. Lufthansa rolled out a free snack cart shortly thereafter.<nl/> A long row of 
counters were soon repurposed for customers to change their flights. Its line - flanked by purple-vested members of 
Lufthansa's 'passenger irregularity team' - quickly outnumbered those waiting to check-in.<nl/> One passenger had 
come into Frankfurt for a stopover from a business trip in Poland when he found out about his cancellation. 'I'm a bit 
disappointed they didn't tell me before I left. In Poland they didn't say anything, they just gave me my boarding 
pass.'<nl/> 'I want to go home to Vienna," said another customer, "but I don't think I'm coming home today." He 
added: 'It's like Kazakhstan, or Italy, or Athens. So many strikes.'<nl/> By the time of the strike's official start, the 
wait to rebook was well over an hour. Many passengers would have to be put into a hotel for the night to try again 
the next day, with no guarantee that they would be any luckier then. One group tried to make the most of it, belting 
songs and playing games. <nl/> Cutting edge or chopping board? <nl/> Under pressure to keep up with a rapidly 
changing airline market, Lufthansa has been undergoing a thorough restructuring of its operations. It is challenged 
on two fronts: by the surge of bare-bones, low-cost airlines within Europe, such as RyanAir and easyJet, on one 
Lufthansa strike keeps passengers on the ground and in the dark
end, and by the advance of international carriers with lower overheads outside of Europe, such as Emirates and 
Turkish Airlines, on the other.<nl/> To compete, analysts have urged the company to cut back on its largest 
expense beyond fuel - labor. CEO Carsten Spohr, who assumed his position in 2014 amid sinking profit projections, 
has pushed forward with the suggestions.<nl/> Central to the company's strategy is the expansion of its own low-
cost subsidiary Eurowings, whose cheaper tickets are made possible by reducing spending on its employees. The 
pilots' union sought to halt the expansion of Eurowings, until its strikes were deemed illegal by a German court for 
meddling in company strategy.<nl/> Learning from this lesson, UFO has focused its demands on its members' 
benefits most threatened by the expansion - chiefly pensions - instead of the expansion itself.<nl/> Value versus 
values <nl/> Where does customers' loyalty lie? With the workers, who would like a reason to serve with a genuine 
smile? Or with the company, who would like to get their customers where they need to be as cheaply as 
possible?<nl/> On top of the economic damage it can wreak, the fate of the strike lies in this answer. UFO knows 
this and is aware of the need to win over sympathy. Its task is to convince customers that the crew members are 
striking not out of choice, but because Lufthansa has made its own choice and refuses to budge.<nl/> So the union 
has railed this week against what is sees as Lufthansa's propaganda. In press statements in the lead-up to the 
strike, the company reiterated that it was offering everything that the union was demanding. The union intensely 
denies this, calling successive offers 'purely PR gags' and 'old wine in new bottles.'<nl/> In any case, like many 
travelers before it, the message may be getting lost in the massive Frankfurt Airport. Asked what he thought about 
the striker's demands, one customer in line to rebook his flight replied, 'Oh, I didn't know there was a strike.'<nl/> 
While people wait for the confusion to clear, one thing is certain: This won't be the last of it. This very week 
Lufthansa entered into negotiations with another union, Verdi, representing the company's labor on the ground and 
in cargo planes, about 33,000 workers in total.<nl/>

Stocks extended gains in afternoon trading Tuesday, led by energy stocks as oil prices rose.<nl/>
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.5%, while the Nasdaq rose 0.4% and the S...00 added 0.2% in the 
stock market today.[1] Volume was tracking higher on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq exchanges than on 
Monday.<nl/> Chevron (NYSE:CVX[2]) was up 3% and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM[3]) climbed 2% as oil jumped 
above $47 a barrel after reports of a port shutdown in Libya.<nl/> Meanwhile, Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY[4]), an 
Ireland-based short-haul airline, jumped 4% in heavy volume, clearing an 82.81 buy point of a late-stage flat base. 
Before the open, Raymond James upgraded the stock to outperform from market perform.<nl/> Supercomputer 
maker Cray (NASDAQ:CRAY[5]) soared 7% in heavy volume as it continues to rise following a blowout Q3 earnings 
report last Thursday. The stock, which had fallen as much as 50% from its 52-week high, is now just 6% off the 
peak after soaring back above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.<nl/> Noah Holdings (NYSE:NOAH[6]), a 
Chinese provider of wealth management[7] services, jumped nearly 9% in huge volume.<nl/> Noah is due to report 
Q3 results Nov. 16. Profit for the period is seen rising 21% to 41 cents a share, which would be the biggest gain in 
four quarters.<nl/> The stock is climbing the right side of a deep base, but it's still 17% off its May peak.<nl/> On the 
downside, Taser International (NASDAQ:TASR[8]), maker of stun guns and police body cameras, dropped 14% 
after announcing that its Q3 profit plunged 79% from the same period last year. The result was much worse than 
expected. The stock sliced through its 50-day moving average.<nl/> [ 1]: http://www.investors.com/stock-market-

Nov 03, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Alaska Airlines, the 
wholly owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group ALK[1], has been making constant efforts to expand further in a bid to 
boost revenues and improve customer satisfaction. To that end, the company, of late, has been on a route addition 
spree. 
The latest move in this direction came with the Seattle-based carrier introducing two new routes connecting Los 
Angeles to San Jose and Liberia.<nl/>The carrier stated that it will offer eight flights per week on the two new 
routes. Costa Rica, a favorite tourist spot, is the first international destination for the carrier in 24 years. We remind 
investors that in 1991, the carrier had launched seasonal service to Magadan, Russia. Alaska Airlines stated in its 
press release that following the latest expansion initiative, it is now offering up to 80 peak season departures on a 
weekly basis from Southern California to Latin America.<nl/>While the flights connecting Los Angeles-San Jose will 
operate on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays, the Los Angeles-Liberia service will take to the skies on 
Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays. Alaska Airlines is utilizing the fuel-efficient, next generation 737-800 
aircraft of The Boeing Company BA[2] on these routes. The aircraft is equipped with all modern facilities to enhance 
the flying experience of travelers.<nl/>The announcement of the new routes comes close on the heels of the 
company reporting higher-than-expected earnings and revenues in the third quarter of 2015. Results were aided by 
low fuel costs. The carrier is making huge savings, thanks to low fuel costs. In such a favorable backdrop, the plan 
to introduce new routes is a prudent move to bolster passenger revenues.<nl/>Zacks Rank<nl/>Alaska Air Group 
currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked airline stocks include Virgin America VA[3] and Ryanair 
Holdings plc RYAAY[4]. Both the stocks hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).<nl/>Want the latest recommendations from

a 2% premarket gain. The Ireland-based economy[14] airline is in a flat base with an 82.81 buy point.<nl/> 
Overseas markets were mixed, with Japan the morning's standout. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 dropped 2.1%, dragging

Reuters<nl/>Via Dave Lutz at JonesTrading, here's a super quick guide to what traders are talking about before 
markets open on Monday:<nl/>
 Good Morning and welcome to Jobs Week! US Futures are starting mixed this AM, continuing a theme which sees 
S...p small but the Russell lagging. European markets are mostly green, led by a 90bp pop in the DAX with EU 
Banks leading as Commerzbank returns to paying a divvy and Greek Stress Test results not as bad as feared. 
Another Strong airline report being met with sharp selling as Ryanair drops 4%+, and Miners weigh on FTSE, with 
Glencore and BHP under pressure as China PMI comes in light - pushing London down 40bp in light Volume. The 
standout market in Europe is Turkey, which sees markets up 5%+ as Erdogan's party sweeps back to power with a 
surprise win. Over in Asia, it was a sea of red thanks to weaker China data, hitting Shanghai for 1.7% - while Nikkei 
fell 2% as investors reacted toFriday's BOJ - Financials and utilities weighed heavy (Japan closed for Culture Day 
tomorrow). Aussie fell 1.4% as grocers continue to reel from Woolworths last week - while most Emerging Markets 
closed mixed. <nl/> The US 10YY has shot back to test Friday's highs near 2.17% and the 'Policy Sensitive' 2YY is 
climbing to 75bp and December Fed Funds show a 'Coin Flip' as we await a slew of Fed Speakers this week, 
including Janet on Wednesday. The Greenback is mixed, as the Pound jumping on strong British PMI - and $ losing 
slight ground against the Euro as Nowonty says the 'ECB has to act' - but making gains against the Yen as the $/Y 
cross rebounds from the 120 level. With the weaker $, we should hava tailwind for commodities, but most metals 
are firmly red as Industrial exposed Platinum and Silver drop 1%+, and the Crude complex is off 1.5%+ on weaker 
China data. Natty Gas is continuing its downward trajectory as heavy stockpiles coupled with mild weather have 
heavy selling continuing in the complex - knocking contracts off 3%+ early. <nl/> Ahead of us today, we get Markit 
US Manufacturing PMI at 9:45, ahead of the 'official' ISM Manufacturing and Construction Spending data at 10 - At 
11:30 the Treasury has a Auction of $28B in 3month and $26B in 6mnth Bills, just before Fed's Williams Gives 
Welcome Remarks at SF Fed Conference at 12. At 2pm, we get the October 2015 Senior Loan Officer Opinion 
Survey on Bank Lending Practices. Down in Washington, the Court delivers orders at 9:30am, and at 2pm Treasury 
Secretary Lew convenes the latest meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.<nl/>NOW WATCH: Donald

Dude finds his exact doppelgänger in his airplane seat

Oct 30, 2015( The Daily Dot: http://www.dailydot.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Who among us hasn't wanted to 
meet their doppelgänger—either by chance on the street or while checking out produce in the grocery store or while 
eating Sunday morning brunch and trying to fight off a hangover?
<nl/>Or, in the case of the ginger gentlemen below, on a plane. These two dudes who look exactly the same but 
aren't related were traveling to the same place at the same time, and they didn't even have to spend a month online 
trying to find the other[1]. Check out how well they mirror the other.<nl/> Lee Beattie told BuzzFeed[2] that Neil 
Thomas Douglas, the man on the right, is a photographer who was flying from Glasgow to Galway in order to shoot 
a wedding.<nl/> 'When he got on his Ryanair flight, there was a dude already on his seat," Beattie said. 'He asked 
him to move, and when the guy looked up, he thought: 'Holy shit, he looks like me.' They had a big laugh about it—
everyone around them had a laugh, they took a selfie and that was it.'<nl/>They also happened to check into the 
same hotel, and later that night, they ended up in the same pub. So they drank a pint in solidarity, celebrating how 
their lives temporarily joined together (and how they're now joined together forever on the Internet). <nl/> And then 
the freakin' floodgates opened.<nl/><nl/>All of which serves as a reminder: Your mother might have told you as a 
child that you were special. And maybe that's true. But if you're a dude with a big red beard and short, light hair 
that's expertly styled, your mother quite possibly has lied to you.<nl/> Photo via Lee Beattie[3]/Twitter<nl/> Related

Oct 30, 2015( The Huffington Post: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ;<nl/> Most travelers 
can't wait for their airplane seatmate to stop talking[1]. But if you found yourself seated next to your exact 
doppelganger, you'd probably never want to stop bonding. <nl/><nl/>U.K. photographer Neil Thomas Douglas[2] 
took a Ryanair flight to Galway, Ireland Thursday night on his way to photograph a wedding. 
Upon boarding, he found his near-perfect twin sitting right next to him[3]: <nl/><nl/>Guy on right is the husband of

friend of Douglas' wife, posted the photo on Twitter[7], where it swiftly went viral. The two men had never met 
before the flight and they're not related, she told HuffPost in an email.<nl/><nl/>"There was a dude already on 
[Douglas'] seat. He asked him to move and when the guy looked up, he thought, 'Holy shit, he looks like me.' They 
had a big laugh about it -- everyone around them had a laugh, they took a selfie and that was it," Beattie 
said. <nl/><nl/>But then things got even stranger after the flight: The men found themselves checking into the same 
hotel, and later, drinking at the same bar. <nl/><nl/>"Neil then checked into his hotel in Galway to find his 
doppelgänger checking into the same hotel ahead of him. They laughed," Beattie said. "Later that night, Neil went 
to the pub and again, there was his twin. Total weirdness. They had a laugh and a pint."<nl/><nl/>Not long after 
Beattie's post, another doppelgänger chimed in [8]on Twitter. Then another[9], and another. Three red-bearded 
men have so far claimed to resemble those on the plane: <nl/><nl/>I count five! @the_real_pumps[10]

carrier Lufthansa has reported a surge in bottom-line earnings for the third quarter, saying the jump is also

The company lifted its full-year outlook. Lufthansa on Thursday said its net profit for the July to September period 
increased by 41.5 percent year-on-year to 794 million euros ($867 million).<nl/> The company, which owns 
subsidiary Germanwings as well as Swiss and Austrian Airlines, saw its revenue up 5.1 percent in the same

Oct 29, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Dallas-based low-
cost carrier Southwest Airlines LUV[1] has been making constant efforts to expand further in a bid to boost 
revenues and improve customer satisfaction. To that end, the company has been consistently adding new 
routes.<nl/>
The latest move in that direction came when the carrier stated that it will launch ten new non-stop routes from next 
year. The fares (one-way) for the new routes have kept notably low to attract more fliers during the spring season. 
The flight schedule has been extended from April 12 through June 3.<nl/>The table below summarizes the new 
routes to be introduced by the carrier. Apart from the non-stop service connecting St. Louis and Pittsburgh, all other 
flights will start operating from Apr 12. The flights on the St. Louis - Pittsburgh route will start operating on Mar 
10.<nl/><nl/><nl/><nl/><nl/><nl/><nl/><nl/><nl/><nl/><nl/><nl/><nl/><nl/><nl/><nl/> <nl/>Tickets 
are 
already 
available for the new flights and customers must buy their tickets by Nov 2 to avail the low fares. Moreover, the 
carrier intends to offer nonstop service between St. Louis and Seattle across the year. The service was previously 
offered on a seasonal basis.<nl/>The announcement of the new routes comes close on the heels of the company 
reporting higher-than-expected earnings and revenues in the third quarter of 2015. Results were aided by low fuel 
costs. The carrier is making huge savings, thanks to low fuel costs. In such a favorable backdrop, the plan to 
introduce new routes is a prudent move to bolster passenger revenues.<nl/>Zacks Rank<nl/>Southwest Airlines 
currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Investors interested in the airline space may also consider, Virgin America 
VA[2], Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[3] and SkyWest Inc. SKYW[4]. All the three companies sport a Zacks Rank #1

Oct 28, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> For Immediate 
Release<nl/> <nl/> Chicago, IL - October 28, 2015 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst 
Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the 
financial markets. 
Stocks recently featured in the blog include the FedEx Corporation (FDX[1]), United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS[2]), 
TNT Express N.V. (TNTEY[3]) and Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY[4]). <nl/> <nl/> Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' 
stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free[5].<nl/> <nl/> Here are highlights from Tuesday's 
Analyst Blog: <nl/> <nl/> FedEx Gears Up for Record Holiday Season Deliveries<nl/> <nl/> With the holiday season 
approaching, transportation/logistics stocks like FedEx Corporation (FDX[6]) and United Parcel Service, Inc. 
(UPS[7]) are fully in focus, as is the case at this time every year. The holiday season is normally considered a busy 
period for such companies, as shipping volumes tend to surge.<nl/> <nl/> Yesterday, FedEx - a leading player in 
the field of global express delivery services -unveiled a rosy forecast pertaining to the holiday season, predicting 
record shipping volumes during the period. The Memphis, TN-based shipping giant foresees 317 million shipments 
- a 12.4% year-over-year increase - during the Black Friday-to-Christmas Eve period.<nl/> <nl/> To meet the surge 
in demand, FedEx intends to add in excess of 55,000 employees to its workforce this holiday season. Package 
handlers and drivers, apart from other support functions, would primarily see a seasonal addition in workforce.<nl/> 
<nl/> Recent growth trends in e-commerce are primarily responsible for this optimistic forecast. Data released by 
the National Retail Federation has projected a 3.7% increase in retail sales in November and December to $630.5 
billion. With shopping going the digital way, e-commerce sales are expected to shine, with growth expected in the 
band of 6-8% to $105 billion.<nl/> <nl/> An additional day this holiday season, compared to last year, is the icing on 
the cake. Shipment volumes are expected to touch astronomical heights on Cyber Monday (Nov 30) and the first 
two Mondays in December. The company stated that it hopes to move more than double its daily average on these 
three consecutive super-busy Mondays.<nl/> <nl/> The holiday season forecast has been included in the 
company's earnings per share projection for fiscal 2016. Management expects earnings per share in the band of 
$10.40-$10.90 for the current fiscal.<nl/> <nl/> Furthermore, the company will expand its operations during the 
holiday season to manage the rush. The company's Ground unit will run seven-day sort operations and FedEx 
Express will run additional hub sorts, in accordance with customer needs.<nl/> <nl/> FedEx is, in fact, leaving no 
stone unturned to ensure that holiday season demand is met effectively and the 2013 experience, when both FedEx 
and UPS were caught napping, is not repeated, courtesy of a harsh winter and an unexpected surge in on-line

shopping. To this end, the company has stated in its press release that it is investing $1.6 billion in fiscal 2016 
primarily in capacity and automation projects at the FedEx Ground division.<nl/> <nl/> FedEx's rival UPS has 
already announced that in order to meet the expected demand surge during the holiday season, it intends to hire 
around 90,000 to 95,000 additional employees. We expect a further update on UPS' holiday season plans on its 
third quarter 2015 conference call scheduled for today.<nl/> <nl/> FedEx's bullish holiday season projection comes 
close on the heels of the removal of a major hurdle in the way of its impending acquisition of Dutch company, TNT 
Express N.V. (TNTEY[8]), for approximately $8.75 per share, or $4.8 billion. The deal is now expected to be 
completed in the first half of calendar year 2016, as scheduled originally, as the European Commission has not 
raised any objection on the deal following its thorough review of the same. In the event of the deal materializing, 
FedEx would significantly strengthen its foothold in the European market.<nl/> <nl/> Zacks Rank<nl/> <nl/> FedEx 
presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the transportation space is Ryanair Holdings 
(RYAAY[9]) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).<nl/> <nl/> Want the latest recommendations from Zacks

Oct 28, 2015( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ;<nl/> 
Norwegian<nl/>Norwegian, Europe's third-largest budget airline, is aiming to get more business travellers on board 
by making sure its routes from London to different parts in the US are always around £149-£179 ($228-$274).<nl/>
 This is a bit of coup considering long-haul flights to these destinations usually cost at least twice that amount on 
larger incumbent airlines, and aren't available from budget rivals such as Ryanair and easyJet.<nl/> Bjorn Kjos, the 
CEO of Norwegian, told Business Insider that the airline is aiming to rapidly expand in the US and South America 
by serving regular and business travellers, offering prices that legacy airlines can't match, including a London 
Gatwick Airport to Boston flight.<nl/> "We're planning to keep expanding in the US and we are launching our low-
cost route to Boston in May next year. We can't give an exact price but it will be around the Puerto Rico level," said 
Kjos, referring to Norwegian's ownership of Britain's only direct route to Puerto Rico with fares from £179 
($274).<nl/> "We're also hoping to cover Washington DC as well as a few other places in South America and Africa. 
The latter two actually are heavily underserved and have high prices."<nl/> This month, Norwegian agreed to 
purchase 19 new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners. This is a huge deal because the order more than quadruples its 
current long-haul fleet to 38 aircraft within the next five years.<nl/> Considering it does already have short-haul 
flights in Europe, its bid to expand long-haul routes means that it directly competes with incumbent airlines such as 
British Airways and Virgin — but at half the price. It already offers direct flights to popular destinations, such as New 
York, Los Angeles and Fort Lauderdale, with fares from just £149 ($228).<nl/> Compare this to even a quick search 
on various travel booking websites like Expedia and you can see that the cheapest flights come in at around £500 
($766) and they're indirect.<nl/> "We have a lot business people to date especially long haul because they like the 
low cost that you can't get on legacy carriers combined with the premium seating in-flight as well as features such 
as free Wi-fi — even on short-haul flights," said Kjos.<nl/> "We're looking at Asia in the future but we're 
concentrating on expanding in the US right now."<nl/> It seems to be working.<nl/> Norwegian's third quarter 
results showed a 15% rise in revenue[1], compared with the same period last year. Year-to-date, sales rose by 
15%, compared to the same period in 2014. Pre-tax profits came to 1.1 billion Norwegian krone (£87 million).<nl/> 
In the third quarter, the load factor rose by 6%, compared to the previous period, to 91%. The airline also carried 
7.7 million passengers this quarter while long-haul passenger growth expanded by 15%.<nl/> Norwegian has 
clearly found a gap in the market and its CEO Kjos highlighted how a low oil price environment is helping their 
expansion. Oil prices are around $44 per barrel at the moment. Last summer they were over triple digits. <nl/> 
Norwegian 's CEO just told us it's siphoning customers from its competitors with £150 tickets from London to 
the US
Companies that use oil or fuel usually hedge themselves by agreeing to buy a quantity of the commodity for a 
certain price by a certain date. This means a company could save money if prices were to rise. However, it could 
lose a company lots of money if prices started to crash.<nl/> "When oil was at $100 per barrel we thought there was 
as much risk of it falling as it did going up, so we hedged our fuel by less than 50%," said Kjos. "We're happy with 
that and we don't plan to up our hedging as we anticipate oil prices staying low for at least another two years."<nl/> 
So overall, it looks Norwegian is in a pretty nice sweet spot. It all screams a little like preparation to be bought out. 
However, Kjos was very quick to shoot us down when we mentioned whether they were looking for a suitor.<nl/> 
"Hey no! We've been on our own since 2002 and our idea and strategy is to serve this new market and to keep 
expanding," said Kjos. "Our plans are long term, like 40 or 50 years. We are in a great position and it's easy for us 
to compete against other airlines right now. We're not looking for anything else."<nl/>NOW WATCH: This is what 
will happen if the Fed raises rates[2]<nl/>See Also: This guy used a frequent-flyer loophole to take a $60,000 trip in

profits for the company.<nl/>However, the slump in fuel prices is likely to lead to a price war among the U.S. 
carriers, thereby exerting pressure on low-cost airline operators like Virgin America and Spirit Airlines. Moreover, 
the U.S. airline industry is expanding seat capacity which will lead to lower unit revenue as well as load factor. 
Thus, to fill up seats, most carriers are offering discounted air fares, thereby leading to stiff competition which in turn 
will impact Virgin America's revenues.<nl/>Earnings Whispers<nl/>Our proven model does not conclusively show 
that Virgin America is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to 
have both a positive Earnings ESP[2] and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or at least 3 for this to happen. That is not the case 
here, as you will see below:<nl/>Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are 
poised at $1.57. Hence, the ESP is 0.00%.<nl/>Zacks Rank: Nokia carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) which 
increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction 
difficult.<nl/>Please note that Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings 
announcement.<nl/>Stocks to Consider<nl/>Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model 
shows these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.<nl/>Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[3] has an earnings ESP of +8.41% and a Zacks Rank #1.<nl/>Canadian National Railway Company CNI[4]

Oct 26, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Spirit Airlines 
SAVE[1] is set to release third-quarter 2015 financial results before the opening bell on Oct 27.<nl/>In the last 
quarter, the company posted a positive 1.98% earnings surprise. 
Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.<nl/>Factors at Play<nl/>Spirit Airlines is well poised to 
gain from the expansion of flight services. Moreover, the company's Ultra-Low Bare Fares(TM) program coupled 
with the Frill Control(TM) service allows passengers to pay for only those services which they require. Hence, the 
launch of these services will allow the company to maintain low ticket prices.<nl/>Capacity at Spirit Airlines is 
projected to grow 30.3% in 2015 while the carrier slashed its operating margin outlook for 2015. Flight cancellations 
and below-par revenues were the primary reasons that resulted in the outlook cut. The carrier also believes that its 
top line will remain under pressure in the near term owing to pricing challenges caused by 
overcapacity.<nl/>Earnings Whispers<nl/>Our proven model does not conclusively show that Spirit Airlines is likely 
to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings 
ESP[2] and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not 
the case here as elaborated below.<nl/>Zacks ESP: Spirit Airlines has an earnings ESP of +1.54%. This is because 
the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.32, whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 
$1.30.<nl/>Zacks Rank: Spirit Airlines has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).<nl/>Note that, we caution against stocks 
with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company 
is seeing negative estimate revisions.<nl/>Stocks to Consider<nl/>Here are some companies you may want to 
consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this 
quarter.<nl/>Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[3] has an earnings ESP of +8.41% and a Zacks Rank #1.<nl/>Canadian 
National Railway Company CNI[4] has an earnings ESP of +1.14% and a Zacks Rank #3.<nl/>SkyWest Inc.

A rail postcard from Köln
A rail postcard from Köln

Body
Oct 20, 2015( Jon Worth: http://www.jonworth.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Dear Violeta, It's only a week or so since 
I wrote the last postcard to you[1]. That one didn't receive a response - perhaps you were too busy talking to the rail 
industry, rather than thinking of passengers' needs? Anyway, today at Köln Hbf things went spectacularly wrong as 
happens so often, so I write once more. My Berlin - Köln ICE train had a technical issue at Hamm (Westfalen), 
meaning we had to be diverted via Dortmund and Essen, and ended up at Köln Messe-Deutz rather than Köln Hbf, 
and 30 minutes delayed. 
I spoke to the DB train manager in the train to ask if he could ask the control centre to hold the ICE to Brussels just 
a few minutes so we, the dozen passengers from Berlin who needed the connection, could catch it in Köln. 'The 
train will not wait, right?' were the exact words he used on the phone to the control centre. He did not even try to 
help us, the passengers. 'It's above my level to ask a train to be held,' he later told me, grumpily. A frail, elderly lady 
who spoke no German was brushed off by the train manager, and told she would just have to take the S-Bahn from 
Deutz to Hauptbahnhof like everyone else. 'How do I do that?' was her not unreasonable reply. 'Will we have the 
right to take the later Thalys?' asked another passenger? 'How am I supposed to know,' the train manager 
answered. 'You'll have to ask at Köln station.' Gee, thanks! You see, Violeta, I can tolerate all kinds of technical 
issues, and I have also had to re-plan my way around strikes, but those I understand. But the lack of a little 
customer service, or a little flexibility for passengers really rankles. Yet when we actually got to Deutz there was our 
ICE to Brussels, just not scheduled to stop there, but only at Hauptbahnhof. So through it went, slowly, without us 
on board. A little forward thinking from the staff of the railway would have allowed it to pause briefly there, and 
saved all of us hanging around for an hour awaiting the next train. Alternatively holding it literally 3 minutes at 
Hauptbahnhof would also have solved the issue. Now, Violeta, this train trip cost me €74,20, single, and that's with 
a BahnCard25. I am paying for a supposedly premium service here, but a premium customer service damned 
certainly is not what I am getting! Ryanair offers an alternative for Berlin - Brussels trips, and I booked one last 
week for €10,19. Yes. 10 Euro. For a flight. How does that make you feel, Violeta? I suspect you don't actually 
know how much your flights cost you these days as you've a minion to do the booking for you. But let me tell you, it 
makes me feel kind of dirty. Or at least the amount of CO2 I'm going to be pumping out does. But customers are 
surely going to vote with their feet; if rail is unreliable and unfriendly, then people will go for the cheaper and faster 
option. I am sure you, like the rail firms, will pay lip service to climate goals and green transport at the COP21 
meeting in Paris. The UIC will stick on a few special trains[2] and you can smile in front of them like the hypocrites 
did prior to Copenhagen[3]. And then all will return to normal - where European railways will keep defending their 
national markets, and passengers on international routes will keep losing out. Anyway, until next time, safe travels!

Delta Air Lines Faces Legal Charges for Trophy Transport Ban
Delta Air Lines Faces Legal Charges for Trophy Transport Ban

Oct 19, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Atlanta, GA-based 
airline behemoth Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL[1] is at the center of controversy pertaining to its decision earlier in the 
year to ban transportation of big game hunting trophies.<nl/>
According to various media reports, a hunter (Corey Knowlton), who shelled out $350,000 for a permit to kill an 
endangered black rhino in Namibia, and various U.S.-based hunting clubs, have sued the carrier for its decision. In 
a lawsuit filed in a Dallas federal court, the parties alleged that Delta's ban is illegal and hurts well-meaning hunters. 
According to a Reuters report, they have argued that the ban 'hurts conservation efforts and violates its global 
obligations'. The report further states that the aggrieved parties are adamant that the 'transport of the trophies is 
permitted under a strict systems of global permits and the carrier must abide by its obligations'.<nl/>Moreover, since 
Delta is the sole American carrier operating direct flights between Johannesburg and destinations in the U.S., its 
decision to ban transportation of trophies of lions, leopards, elephants, rhinoceros and buffalos as cargo on its 
planes is a big setback to hunters' efforts to bring the trophies home.<nl/>Not keen to budge from its decision, Delta 
naturally turned down Knowlton's request to transport the trophy to the U.S. from Africa. This led the hunter and the 
other associated parties to take recourse to legal action against Delta and challenge the ban in court.<nl/>We 
remind investors that Delta enforced the ban in August this year, following the furor surrounding the killing of the 
lion, Cecil, at Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park by a Minnesota-based dentist, Walter Palmer. The dentist was on 
a vacation in Zimbabwe and, according to a report appearing in Fortune, had paid a fee of $50,000 for the trophy 
hunting. According to a Reuters report, American Airlines Group AAL[2] and United Continental Holdings UAL[3] 
had also imposed bans similar to Delta in August. <nl/>Zacks Rank<nl/>Delta carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). 
Investors interested in the airline space may also consider Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] which sports a Zacks Rank 
#1 (Strong Buy).<nl/>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can

Oct 19, 2015( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Though my recent trip to 
Denver was for a wedding, I had ulterior motives. I was hoping to schedule some time with Frontier's executive 
team since the airline has been doing some really interesting things lately. The team is attempting to do something 
we haven't seen in the US yet: run an ultra low cost carrier that has a great operation. 
The transition over the last year has been tough, but Frontier is now a very different airline, and one that's doing 
quite well for itself and for its customers.<nl/><nl/>The airline's headquarters building sits in a nondescript complex 
near the bend in Pena Road a few miles west of the airport. This area was nothing until the airport was built, but 
since then, hotels and chain restaurants have popped up to serve travelers.<nl/> Right in front of the door sits a 
Jeep that was just given away to a flight attendant for achieving record ancillary sales. Inside, I had quite the line-up 
waiting for me. First up was President Barry Biffle. Then it was COO Bill Meehan and Debbie Price, VP Customer 
Experience. Lastly I'd meet with Daniel Shurz, SVP Commercial and Josh Flyr, Sr Director, Network.<nl/> A Big 
House-Cleaning<nl/>Daniel is unique in the organization. He's the only senior executive who was there before 
Indigo Partners bought the then-struggling airline from Republic back in late 2013[1]. At the time, Frontier was 
nearly two years into its attempt to change into an Ultra Low Cost Carrier (ULCC)[2] but things weren't going as well 
as hoped. Republic had unloaded Frontier for a pittance. The airline wasn't running a good operation, its costs 
weren't as low as they needed to be, and customers were angry.<nl/> Indigo came in and cleaned house, bringing 
in Barry Biffle, the former right-hand man to Spirit CEO Ben Baldanza, in April 2014. In May, Frontier found a new 
CFO. In June, Bill Meehan, formerly an exec with Continental, joined as COO and brought Debbie Price with him. 
Changes went into overdrive.<nl/> At the time, Frontier faced an internal perception problem. Its previous plan to be 
a full service hub carrier didn't work, but its employees didn't know it. According to Bill, there were no regular 
operations updates, and communication was poor across the board. For Bill, the first priority was to bring 
consistency and structure. He admitted it 'was much worse than we thought it was.'<nl/> For example, the planning 
team had moved half of the airline to flights outside of Denver, many along the east coats, but maintenance was still 
being done in Denver alone. Outside of maintenance, much of the airline's services had been outsourced to 
'business partners,' but there wasn't enough attention being paid to working with those partners to operate correctly. 
Debbie came in and implemented training programs unique to each station. Business partners are now brought in 
at least twice a year.<nl/> But Frontier's problems went beyond its operation. I asked Barry how he was going to 
differentiate Frontier, and he told me to hold on. He came back with a picture he had hanging on the wall in the 
hallway. It's the airline's blueprint.<nl/><nl/>One area that needed some attention was the network. Last summer, 
Frontier Management Tells Me How It's a Different Kind of Ultra Low Cost Carrier
Frontier had 118 routes it flew less than daily. By the end of this year it will be down to 6. Why the change? Those 
routes are more costly and more difficult to run from an operational perspective. Cutting many of these routes 
helped to simplify things.<nl/> Network and operations now work together to make sure that upcoming schedules 
can be comfortably-operated, a process that wasn't previously collaborative. The result is that the airline is now 
running a schedule that allows its airplanes to see 13 hour utilization each day, including the impact of spares. And 
it is running a very good operation.<nl/> According to masFlight[3], Frontier has seen 86.7 percent of flights arrive 
within 14 minutes of schedule since September 1. The airline has also only canceled 0.2 percent of its flights. 
Those are stellar numbers which, admittedly, have come during good weather. This winter will be a good test to see 
how things hold up.<nl/> This may sound foreign to people who are used to seeing Allegiant and Spirit run poor 
operations. But look to Europe and you can see this is a model that works. Ryanair runs one of the most punctual 
airlines around.<nl/> Changing Its Product<nl/>With things coming together, the airline turned to its product offering. 
On the pricing side, it went to a fully a la carte model[4], but then it introduced 'The Works.' For a flat fee, you can 
effectively buy what would be a very good coach product (including full refundability and extra legroom seating). If 
you don't want that, you can just pay the base fare and pick and choose your add-ons.<nl/> On the aircraft, Frontier 
went toward a much more dense offering, but it did so thoughtfully. It invested in all new seats with an interesting 
feature. The middle is wider than other seats on the airplane[5]. <nl/> Up front, there are Stretch seats which have 
Economy Plus-style legroom. In the back, the regular seats are thinner and have less legroom, but that doesn't 
mean they're torture chambers. Barry noted that the airline invested in what amounted to 30 pounds of foam 
cushioning on each aircraft above what it had to do. That may not sound like a lot, but your butt will appreciate 
it.<nl/> There are also little things that may be surprising. Yes, food and drink are sold on the airplane, but cups of 
water are free. Why do that if it's going to cost the airline? Barry likens Frontier to Wal-Mart instead of K-Mart. He 
says 'treating people just a little bit better, a little more friendly… that will make the difference.'<nl/> The Big Stuff is 
Done<nl/>All of the major changes are done. Frontier now has unit costs excluding fuel below 6 cents, which is 
similar to Spirit. But that's going to continue to go down. The airline has 80 A320neos on order along with 19 A321s 
(the first of which was just delivered). The airline has mostly smaller A319s today, and some of those will be 
returned to the lessor soon. With the increase in seating capacity, unit costs will drop. Further, fleet age will 
decrease from 9 years to 4 years. A younger fleet means Frontier can ramp up utilization even further, keeping 
costs down more. <nl/> At this point, Frontier has a cost structure that opens up a lot of opportunities on routes that 
wouldn't have worked before, and it's only going to get better.<nl/> For now, Barry just wants people to know that 
Frontier is offering, as its tagline says, 'Low Fares Done Right.' That's why the airline has started a nationwide 
campaign, including letters published in newspapers explaining that Frontier is a very different airline than it 
was.<nl/> Now What?<nl/>What's next? There aren't any big structural changes left, but now it's a matter of refining 
the model. He's working on making Frontier a more family-friendly airline, and the animals on the tail are part of 
that. While Barry says that the animals are 'neutral' for adults, 'they're a positive for kids.' Frontier's going to start 
putting the animals on the inside of the window shades. It's also going to put out baseball-style cards for each of 
them, making sure kids can have fun with it as they fly.<nl/> One of the things that bugged me was the airline's lack 
of Pre Check. Barry says Frontier is looking 'pretty heavily' at it. Its reservation system doesn't support it yet, so 
there is a cost involved.<nl/> One thing that's unlikely to come soon is wifi. 'The economics just aren't here,' 
according to Barry. But a mobile app is almost ready to be released. This is going to make check-in much easier 
with mobile boarding passes.<nl/> Watching Frontier make this transition has been painful, but it appears that the 
difficult part is largely done. If it can actually continue to run a good operation and provide a product with good 
value, then it can meaningfully differentiate itself from other ultra low cost carriers. I had the chance to fly Frontier 
on my way home, and it was actually really good. I'll post that report tomorrow.<nl/> [ 1]:

Oct 16, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Dallas, TX-based 
low cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co. LUV[1] has finally launched its international terminal at Houston's Hobby 
airport. 
Following the launch, the carrier has started operating international flights from the new five-gate terminal. The 
move is consistent with the company's plans to expand international operations and improve customer 
convenience.<nl/>The terminal, which cost over $140 million, had been under construction since 2013, according to 
media reports. The commencement of operations at the new terminal is in line with Southwest's aim to strengthen 
its presence in Houston. Apparently, Southwest will use four of the five gates at the new terminal.<nl/>According to 
the press release, the first flight departed to Cancun, Mexico post the opening of the international terminal. 
Moreover, the carrier intends to operate non-stop flights connecting Houston to Jamaica (Montego Bay), Costa Rica 
(San Jose and Liberia) and Belize City, apart from other destinations in Mexico (Mexico City, Puerto Vallarta and 
San Jose del Cabo/Los Cabos).<nl/>Moreover, with nonstop flights connecting Houston with San Juan (Puerto 
Rico) and Oranjestad (Aruba), the total number of routes operational between Latin America/Caribbean islands and 
Houston will be ten. Tickets for the new flights are already available. We note that Southwest Airlines commenced 
international operations in July last year.<nl/>Notably, as of now, only a small part of Southwest Airlines' revenues 
comes from international operations. The carrier is looking to boost its international revenues through increased 
operations and new routes, and is consistently working toward the same. <nl/>Zacks Rank<nl/>Southwest Airlines 
carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Investors interested in the airline space may also consider Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[2], Virgin America VA[3] and SkyWest Inc. SKYW[4]. All the three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong 
Buy).<nl/>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best

Release <nl/><nl/> Chicago, IL- October 13, 2015 - Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features: 
American Woodmark Corporation (AMWD[1]), Footlocker, Inc. (FL[2]), Lannett Company, Inc. 
(LCI[3]), Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY[4]) and Carrols Corporation ( TAST[5]). <nl/><nl/> 5 Best 'Under the Radar' 
Stocks<nl/><nl/> You don't have to own Apple's stock to be considered a "good" investor.<nl/><nl/> While big cap 
names are often popular with investors simply because investors "know" these brands, sometimes it's the 
companies that no one knows about that provide the best long-term returns.<nl/><nl/> That's why it pays to put 
together a screen for companies with solid Zacks Ranks and good fundamentals. You might be surprised at what 
comes up.<nl/><nl/> Finding Under The Radar Stocks<nl/><nl/> Zacks covers 4400 stocks. That's a big 
universe.<nl/><nl/> How do you narrow down the list to only the best stocks, especially if you're looking for 
companies that aren't always in the news?<nl/><nl/> I started with a search of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks. 
This narrowed the list down to just 224 stocks.<nl/><nl/> That's more manageable.<nl/><nl/> Zacks' Rank Buy #1 
list also includes the Zacks Style Scores for Value, Growth and Momentum.<nl/><nl/> So you can search the 224 
stocks by any of the style scores to narrow the list down even further.<nl/><nl/> I normally am a value investor, but 
today I wanted to find just the best darn companies I could with the best Zacks Rank. If those were higher priced 
growth or momentum stocks, then so be it.<nl/><nl/> Branch Out<nl/><nl/> There are great companies that are 
hidden gems. Look outside the usual box of the big name, big cap players.<nl/><nl/> These 5 stocks are virtually 
unknown, yet their fundamentals are great. They are all Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and have Style Scores of A in 
at least one style.<nl/><nl/> Two have Zacks Style Scores in Growth of A, one is an A in Value and two have Zacks 
Style Scores in Momentum of A.<nl/><nl/> That's not too shabby.<nl/><nl/> Investors should look around. Break out 
of the comfort zone of the big, well-known names. 4 out of the 5 listed below have crushed the return of the S...00 
over the last 10 years, which included the Great Recession sell off.<nl/><nl/> Apple's not the only great stock 
investment of the last 10 years. You might be surprised at how many hidden gems are out there, if you only 
bothered to look.<nl/><nl/> 5 Best Under the Radar Stocks to Buy Now<nl/><nl/> 1. American Woodmark 
Corporation (AMWD[6])<nl/><nl/> American Woodmark makes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and 
new home construction markets in the United States. It sells four brands: American Woodmark, Shenandoah, 
Timberlake and Waypoint. Home Depot and Lowe's sell its brands, as well as specialty kitchen and bath designers 
and distributors.<nl/><nl/> It operates 9 manufacturing facilities and 7 service centers throughout the United

Carrols
States.<nl/><nl/> American Woodmark is a small cap company with a market cap of $1.16 billion.<nl/><nl/> On Aug 
20, it reported its fiscal first quarter 2016 results. Sales rose 9% to $231.2 million year over year as it saw growth in 
both dealer and new construction channels in the quarter.<nl/><nl/> Expected fiscal 2016 earnings growth of 
32.4%<nl/> Forward P/E = 25<nl/><nl/> Zacks Style Score for Growth = A<nl/> Zacks Rank #1 (Strong 
Buy)<nl/><nl/> Over the last 10 years shares up 128.7%<nl/> Over the last 10 years S...00 up 74.1%<nl/><nl/> 2. 
Footlocker, Inc. (FL[7])<nl/><nl/> Foot Locker operates 3500 stores in 23 countries in North America, Europe, 
Australia and New Zealand under several well known name brands including Foot Locker, Footaction, Lady Foot 
Locker, Champs Sports, SIX:02, Runners Point and Sidestep.<nl/><nl/> It also operates web sites for all of its 
brands as well as Eastbay, which is a site for serious athletes.<nl/><nl/> Despite a market cap of nearly $10 billion, 
the company remains an afterthought to most looking to invest in the athletic apparel craze. One of its strategic 
goals is to have company sales top $10 billion. At the end of fiscal 2014, sales were $7.15 billion, so it is well on its 
way.<nl/><nl/> Expected fiscal 2015 earnings growth = 18.3%<nl/> Forward P/E = 16.8<nl/><nl/> Zacks Style 
Score for Momentum = A<nl/> Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)<nl/><nl/> Over the last 10 years shares up 
265.4%<nl/> Over the last 10 years S...00 up 71.4%<nl/><nl/> 3. Lannett Company, Inc. (LCI[8])<nl/><nl/> 
Founded in 1942, Lannett makes generic prescription pharmaceutical products in tablet, capsule and oral liquid 
forms to customers throughout the United States in various therapeutic areas.<nl/><nl/> With a market cap of just 
$1.7 billion, it's rare to find a small cap drug company that hasn't been swallowed up by one of the larger 
companies.<nl/><nl/> On Sep 2, Lannett announced it was purchasing Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals for $1.23 
billion. The transaction will be funded through a fully committed term loan and cash on hand.<nl/><nl/> The 
company expects it to be a transformational acquisition as it adds a highly profitable business that will diversify its 
product lines.<nl/><nl/> Kremers has 11 product applications pending at the FDA, of which 5 include Paragraph IV 
certifications. Longer term, it has growth potential with 17 product candidates in development.<nl/><nl/> Lannett 
believes the acquisition will be accretive to fiscal 2016 earnings in the mid-to-high single digits and in the 20% to 
25% range in fiscal 2017.<nl/><nl/> Expected fiscal 2016 earnings growth = 0.6% (bigger growth expected in fiscal 
2017 of 29%)<nl/> Forward P/E = 11.6<nl/><nl/> Zacks Style Score for Value = A<nl/> Zacks Rank #1 (Strong 
Buy)<nl/><nl/> Over the last 10 years shares up 838.4%<nl/> Over the last 10 years S...00 up 74.1%<nl/><nl/> 4. 
Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY[9])<nl/><nl/> Ryanair is an Irish low cost airlines that flies throughout 
Europe.<nl/><nl/> With a market cap of $21 billion, it's hard to believe it's an under-the-radar stock but when 
American investors think of the airlines, they focus on the American brands such as Southwest.<nl/><nl/> Yet, in its 
fiscal 2016 first quarter, traffic jumped 16% year over year to 28 million passengers. Recently, the momentum has 
continued. In September, traffic grew 12% compared to a year ago with the load factor rising 4% to 94%.<nl/><nl/> 
90% of its fiscal 2016 fuel is hedged. It has also hedged 70% of 2017.<nl/><nl/> Ryanair has been giving back to 
shareholders. It pays a dividend, currently yielding 2.7% and has been buying back shares.<nl/><nl/> By the end of 
fiscal 2016, the airline expects to have a fleet of 340 B737-800s.<nl/><nl/> Expected fiscal 2016 earnings growth = 
-4.5% (but analysts expect EPS growth to rebound in F2017)<nl/> Forward P/E = 15.9<nl/><nl/> Zacks Style Score 
for Momentum = A<nl/> Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)<nl/><nl/> Over the last 10 years shares up 207.8%<nl/> Over 
the last 10 years S...00 up 74.1%<nl/><nl/> 5. Carrols Corporation (TAST[10])<nl/><nl/> You may never have heard 
of this small cap restaurant company but Carrols operates 650 Burger King restaurants in 15 states.<nl/><nl/> It 
originally started operating Carrols Burger restaurants in the 1960s but in 1975, it entered into a franchise 
agreement with Burger King for the Northeast part of the United States.<nl/><nl/> The Carrols branded stores were 
phased out and its been operating Burger Kings ever since.<nl/><nl/> On Aug 4, this Burger King operator reported 
second quarter results and saw comparable store sales jump 10.3% compared to a 2% decrease the year 
before.<nl/><nl/> It has remodeled 350 of its stores in the last year and that is boosting sales. Additionally, the 
Burger King brand is hot as its marketing campaign is working to drive traffic.<nl/><nl/> Moderating commodity 
costs also helped.<nl/><nl/> Carrols raised its full year outlook, including its comparable store sales range to 5% to 
7% from 3% to 5%. This is a brand, and a company to watch, as Burger King, under its new management team, 
seems to have some of its mojo back.<nl/><nl/> Expected 2015 earnings growth = 9.7%<nl/> Forward P/E = 
N/A<nl/><nl/> Zacks Style Score for Growth = A<nl/> Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)<nl/><nl/> Over the last 10 years

Oct 13, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Long Island City, 
NY-based low cost carrier JetBlue Airways Corporation JBLU[1] revealed traffic data for the month of September. 
Important metrics such as revenue passenger miles (RPMs - a measure of air traffic), available seat miles (ASMs: 
measure of capacity) and load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) grew on a year-over-year basis during the 
month.<nl/>
The carrier generated RPMs of 3.097 billion during the month, up 13.3% on a year-over-year basis. Moreover, 
available seat miles showed year-over-year growth of 13.1% to 3.821 billion. Load factor also showed an 
improvement as air traffic growth outpaced the rise in capacity. The metric grew by 20 basis points to 81.1% in Sep 
2015. PRASM (a measure of unit revenue: passenger revenue per available seat mile) for the month also improved 
1% from Sep 2014.<nl/>Although the measures improved on a year-over-basis, the traffic report failed to find favor 
with investors. Consequently, the stock shed value in after-market trading on Oct 12. We note that the Sep 2015 
figures for traffic, capacity and load factor were lower than the corresponding figures recorded in Aug 
2015.<nl/>JetBlue also revealed that departures in Sep 2015 were 10% higher compared with the year-ago figure. 
The company registered a completion factor of 99.6%, with 80% of its flights on schedule.<nl/>For the first nine 
months of 2015, JetBlue generated RPMs of 31.156 billion (up 9.6% from the corresponding period last year) and 
ASMs of 36.632 billion (up 9.2%). Further, the load factor grew 40 basis points year over year to 85.1%.<nl/>Zacks 
Rank<nl/>JetBlue currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Investors interested in the airline space may also 
consider Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2], Hawaiian Holdings HA[3] and SkyWest Inc. SKYW[4]. All the three stocks 
sport the same Zacks Rank as JetBlue.<nl/>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Oct 09, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> United Airlines - the 
wholly owned subsidiary of United Continental Holdings Inc. UAL[1] - reported a rise in air traffic numbers in the 
month of September. 
Measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), traffic stood at 16.86 billion, up 1.4% from 16.62 billion recorded a 
year ago.<nl/>Also, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) inched up 1.4% year over year to 20.33 
billion. Meanwhile, the load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers remained flat at 82.9%.<nl/>At the 
end of the first nine months of 2015, United Airlines recorded RPMs of 157.9 billion (up 1% year over year) and 
ASMs of 188.7 billion (up 1.6% year over year). Load factor stood at 83.7% compared with 84.1% in September last 
year.<nl/>Recently, United Airlines took a step toward enhancing its onboard flight services by striking a deal with 
Crafthouse and Buffalo Trace to offer premium liquor to passengers.<nl/>Meanwhile, in a bid to consolidate its 
position in China, the company announced plans to initiate non-stop weekly flights between San Francisco and 
Xi'an, starting next year.<nl/>The company's significant route expansion plans, introduction of ancillary products, 
fleet revamping and customer service enhancement bode well. Further, United Airlines has been reaping 
considerable benefits from its joint ventures and code share agreements.<nl/>Meanwhile, declining oil prices will 
likely result in increased capacity, thereby leading to discounted ticket prices in order to fill up seats. A stronger U.S. 
dollar is also expected to impact revenues because of United Airlines' global presence.<nl/>On the other hand, U.S. 
airline Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL[2] recently posted a 2.4% year over year increase in air traffic in the month of 
September. The premium carrier expects unit revenue for the third quarter of 2015 to decline in the band of 4.5% 
and 5.5%.<nl/>Stocks to Consider<nl/>United Continental currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other favorably 
ranked stocks in the same space are Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[3] and JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU[4]. Both the

Theses planes offer better leg space and comfortable leather seats. Moreover, to enhance the in-flight experience, 
passengers will be offered complimentary snacks and other refreshments along with free access to DIRECTV 
channels and Sirius XM Holdings Inc.'s SIRI[2] satellite radio service.<nl/>Both Boston and Fort Lauderdale have 
become important tourist spots. Thus, to consolidate its position in these busy areas, JetBlue plans to flag off more 
than 130 daily flights from Boston. Moreover, to boost its Florida network, JetBlue has decided to run 95 daily flights 
from FLL during winter. Furthermore, the company's South Florida operations serve as an important hub for the 
connecting flights which take off to Latin American cities. Thus, the increased number of connecting flights from the 
region will certainly benefit passengers traveling to Latin America and Caribbean cities.<nl/>Hence, we believe that 
improved flight connectivity coupled with low fares will enhance traveling options for passengers, in turn boosting 
revenues for JetBlue.<nl/>JetBlue currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Other favorably ranked stocks in 
the same space are Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[3] and Delta Air Lines DAL[4], both sporting the same Zacks 
Rank as JetBlue.<nl/>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can

Not always the cheapest train in France , and a sneaky 50 cent Belgian charge
Not always the cheapest train in France, and a sneaky 50 cent Belgian 
charge

Oct 07, 2015( Jon Worth: http://www.jonworth.eu/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> A couple of weeks ago Seat61 had 
the splash that booking cross-border France-Spain TGVs would cost you more on French language websites than 
anywhere else (Seat61's news page here[1] - you have to scroll down as he has no link to individual stories). After a 
bit of a furore that caused, SNCF has changed its practice and now the prices for these trains are the same 
regardless of where you book them. It was an error[2] they told Gizmodo - not sure I believe that, but anyway, that 
problem is no more.<nl/> So while that's progress, it's not all plain sailing in French rail booking. SNCF offers 
essentially three classes of TGVs - regular ones, iDTGV[3] that's like a regular TGV but you have to book online, 
and Ouigo[4], like a kind of Ryanair-TGV that has it's own garish paint scheme and interior and leaves from a 
station in the Paris suburbs.<nl/> Say then you want to book Paris - Perpignan, served by regular TGVs and 
iDTGVs. This is what you get from Captain Train (see 1007 departure):<nl/>            https://jonworth.eu/wp-
content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-07-at-18.04.08.png<nl/> And this from Loco2 - 1007 train, but only 
at the more expensive price:<nl/>
 https://jonworth.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-07-at-18.04.18.png<nl/> 
And 
this 
from 
SNCB Europe - same as Loco2, no iDTGV in sight:<nl/>            https://jonworth.eu/wp-
content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-07-at-18.13.47.png<nl/> <nl/> Or try Marne la Vallée to Montpellier, 
served by regular TGVs and Ouigo. Once more Captain Train - see the 1107 departure:<nl/>            
https://jonworth.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-07-at-18.06.47.png<nl/> And this from Loco2 
- no Ouigo (the 1107 train is not even shown):<nl/>            https://jonworth.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-
Shot-2015-10-07-at-18.06.40.png<nl/> And this from SNCB Europe - again no Ouigo:<nl/>            
https://jonworth.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-07-at-18.12.24.png<nl/> I'd love to know 
what's going on here. Is it that these external agents have not asked for access to the iDTGV and Ouigo data? That 
SNCF will not give this data to companies outside France? Or maybe SNCB considers itself a premium service, but 
I'm pretty sure that Loco2 would aim to sell the cheapest tickets it can as its primary pitch is to tourists.<nl/> Also 
another trick I've just encountered is courtesy of SNCB Europe. Seat reservations on German trains run by DB 
normally cost €4,50. Book a DB train via SNCB's website and it's €5. Thanks, SNCB!<nl/>

Oct 06, 2015( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ;;;<nl/> Ryanair, 
Europe's biggest airline, is attacking Google for its "misleading" search ads and is calling on the search giant to 
enforce advertising transparency."<nl/> In a press release[1], Ryanair points to a search for "Ryanair," which 
returns an ad from what appears to be the official airline itself. <nl/>
<nl/>In fact, Ryanair says this ad is from an unaffiliated "screenscraper" website called eDreams, which is 
"masquerading" as Ryanair and "unlawfully" selling its flights.<nl/> Here's the eDreams site the search ad redirects 
to:<nl/><nl/>Ryanair says sites such as eDreams have caused considerable problems for its customers, including 
failing or refusing to pass on information to the airline and passengers regarding details such as flight time changes, 
check-in information, special needs assistance, and contact information, which has resulted in missed flights in 
some cases.<nl/> Ryanair says it has taken legal action against several screenscraper websites across Europe. 
The Court of Hamburg ruled in January that eDreams had been using an unlawful subdomain[2] and was 
misleading customers into thinking it had an official partnership with Ryanair.<nl/> But Ryanair is demanding 
Google works harder to prevent these issues from occurring in the first place.<nl/> Tweet Embed:

company doesn't have a problem with Google advertising in general, but adds that it is "unfair" that it is sometimes 
used as a way to mislead customers.<nl/> He adds: "Ryanair will continue to pursue screenscraper websites such 
as eDreams to prevent Europe's consumers from being misled over price and booking conditions. We would again 
urge customers to book directly on the Ryanair.com website to guarantee the lowest fares and best customer 
service. In the meantime, we call on Google to enforce greater transparency of its advertising to prevent any more 
customers from being misled and overcharged."<nl/> Business Insider has contacted Google for comment, and 
we'll update this article once we hear back.<nl/> We have also contacted the UK's Advertising Standards Authority, 
to check whether Ryanair has made an official complaint.<nl/>NOW WATCH: Subliminal sex messages hidden in

Looking for a Top Momentum Stock? 3 Reasons Why Ryanair Holdings ( RYAAY ) is a Great Choice
Looking for a Top Momentum Stock? 3 Reasons Why Ryanair Holdings 
(RYAAY) is a Great Choice

Oct 06, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Many investors like 
to look for momentum in stocks, but this can be very tough to define. There is great debate regarding which metrics 
are the best to focus on in this regard, and which are not really quality indicators of future performance. 
Fortunately, with our new style score system[1] we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and 
thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term.<nl/>This method discovered several 
great candidates for momentum-oriented investors, but today let's focus in on Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[2] as 
this stock is looking especially impressive right now. And while there are numerous ways in which this company 
could be a great choice, we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for RYAAY's status as a solid 
momentum stock below:<nl/>Longer Term Price Change for Ryanair Holdings<nl/>While any stock can see a spike 
in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. That is why looking at longer term price 
metrics—such as performance over the past three months or year-- and comparing these to an industry at large can 
be very useful.<nl/>And in the case of RYAAY, the results are quite impressive. The company has beaten out the 
industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 9.5% to -1.5% while it has also outperformed when looking 
at the past year, putting up a gain of 40.3%. Clearly, RYAAY is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look 
by investors. <nl/>Quarter EPS Estimate Change for Ryanair Holdings Stock<nl/>While looking at price 
performance or full year earnings can be essential to understanding a momentum stock, you shouldn't forget about 
the current quarter EPS and the trend in estimates there. This change can signal how a stock might perform in the 
next earnings season which is obviously vital for momentum investors. Right now, RYAAY is seeing a nice trend 
over the past month when it comes to this quarter's earnings estimate projections. In the time frame, EPS estimates 
for Ryanair Holdings have gone up by 93.3% compared to an industry average move of 0.4%, suggesting that not 
only is RYAAY heading in the right direction, but it is seeing an increase relative to the industry too.<nl/>RYAAY 
Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right Direction<nl/>While the great momentum factors outlined in the 
preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors, we should also take into account broad earnings 
estimate revision trends. A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock, and we have actually been 
seeing that with RYAAY as of late too. Over the past two months, 4 earnings estimates have gone higher compared 
to none lower for the full year, while 3 earnings estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the next 
year time frame too. These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as two months ago RYAAY was 
expected to post earnings of $3.99 per share for the full year, though today it looks to have EPS of $4.81 for the full 
year now, representing a solid increase which is something that should definitely be welcomed news to would-be 
Looking for a Top Momentum Stock? 3 Reasons Why Ryanair Holdings ( RYAAY ) is a Great Choice
investors.<nl/>Bottom Line<nl/>Given these factors, investors shouldn't be surprised to note that we have RYAAY 
as a security with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Momentum Score of 'A'. So if you are looking for a fresh pick 
that has potential to move in the right direction, definitely keep RYAAY on your short list as this looks be a stock 
that is very well-positioned to soar in the near term.<nl/>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment

Oct 06, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Employee-related 
concerns continue to trouble France's leading carrier Air France-KLM SA AFLYY[1]. As per a recent Bloomberg 
report, management at the company has been recently in talks with the union representatives over the 
retrenchment of 2,900 workers. This proposal has launched a series of protests.<nl/>
Since 1993, Air France has avoided outright firing of employees and has instead followed voluntary retirement 
schemes to cut jobs. However, after failed talks with pilots last week, Air France executives announced that 300 
cockpit crew, 900 flight attendants and 1,700 ground staff could be dismissed soon. Over the last three years, the 
company has cut back 9,000 positions.<nl/>Air France is struggling to brave global competition for short as well as 
long flights from cheap European and Middle East carriers. Moreover, budget European airlines like Ryanair 
Holdings plc RYAAY[2] and Norwegian Air Shuttle continue to gain customers owing to low fares and expanded 
networks, posing serious threat to large carriers like Air France and Deutsche Lufthansa Aktiengesellschaft 
DLAKY[3].<nl/>Air France ended its second-quarter 2015 with €4.6 billion of net debts while employee salary 
related costs stood at €1.96 billion, up 2.6% year over year. Meanwhile, the loss figure widened from the year-
earlier quarter to €70 million. Thus, to counter such negatives, the company plans to slash unit costs in the range of 
1% to 3% and also reduce debts. Moreover, immediate deployment of cost-saving measures coupled with of the 
adoption of cost-reduction techniques will benefit the company.<nl/>At the end of the second quarter of 2015, Air 
France reported a 3%year-over-year increase in revenues while load factor inched up 0.2%. Moreover, unit revenue 
per Available Seat Kilometer and unit revenue per Revenue Passenger Kilometer rose on an annual basis of 2.2% 
and 1.9%, respectively.<nl/>As a part of its cost-cutting goals, Air France is planning to shut down five long-haul 
networks and dispose 14 of its larger, long distance aircraft.<nl/>In Mar 2015, pilots of Lufthansa went on a four-day 
strike following the fallout of talks with management over early retirement benefits. Furthermore, the carrier's plan to 
expand low-cost offerings has also come under attack from the pilots.<nl/>As per a Bloomberg report, U.S. airline 
giant Delta Air Lines DAL[4] intends to trim its 'office workforce' across the globe in an attempt to boost productivity. 
The retrenchment will apparently affect management and salaried employees.<nl/>Employee-related problems 
continue to haunt the overall airline industry. It has not only hurt the airline profitability but also disrupted flight 
services. 
Moreover, 
falling 
crude 
oil 
prices 
have 
encouraged 
employees 
to 
bargain 
for 
higher 
wages.<nl/>Meanwhile, the ongoing dispute with pilots has already resulted in massive flight cancellations for Air 
France. However, implementation of aggressive strategies has improved results in the second quarter of 
2015.<nl/>Air France currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).<nl/>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks

Oct 02, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Low-cost carrier 
JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU[1] is consistently engaged in efforts to expand its operations. In keeping with this 
objective, the Long Island City, NY-based carrier announced the commencement of daily flights to Mexico City, 
thereby making the capital of Mexico its 91st destination across the globe. 
As far as the Latin America and Caribbean region is concerned, Mexico City marks the 35th destination for 
JetBlue.<nl/>Effective yesterday, JetBlue has started operating flights from the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood 
International Airport (FLL) and Orlando International Airport (MCO) to the Mexico City International Airport (MEX), 
thereby enhancing connectivity between two key Florida cities and Mexico's capital. We note that Mexico City is a 
popular tourist spot, thanks to its large number of museums.<nl/>That Latin America is at the center of JetBlue's 
expansion plans is evident. In addition to Mexico City, the company announced that it will start operating daily non-
stop flights connecting FLL and the busy Mariscal Sucre International Airport in Ecuador. The new route, which will 
be operational from Feb 25, 2016, will facilitate connectivity between Fort Lauderdale in Florida and Ecuador's 
capital, Quito. Tickets for the new route, which are initially priced at $139 (one-way), are already 
available.<nl/>Quito is also a key tourist spot with various attractions like museums, parks and is home to one of the 
best-preserved historic centers across the globe. Consequently, we are positive on the carrier's decision to offer 
flights to Mexico City and Quito. We believe this should boost the company's top line further on the back of 
increased demand.<nl/>Zacks Rank<nl/>JetBlue currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Investors 
interested in the airline space may also consider Delta Air Lines DAL[2], Alaska Air Group, Inc. ALK[3] and Ryanair 
Holdings RYAAY[4]. All the three carriers also sport a Zacks Rank #1.<nl/>Want the latest recommendations from

Oct 01, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> In sync with its 
seasonal plans, low-cost carrier JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU[1] recently announced non-stop flights between 
Syracuse Hancock International Airport (SYR) and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL).<nl/>
JetBlue will be offering one round-trip service every day starting Jan 13, 2016 through May 1, 2016. An introductory 
fare of $79 for one-way travel is presently on offer for customers booking for flights during that period.<nl/>JetBlue 
will fly EMBRAER 190 aircraft which offer two-by-two seating facility. Moreover, passengers will be able to enjoy 
better leg space along with complimentary free snacks and other refreshments. Passengers will also be able to 
access free DIRECTV channels and Sirius XM Holdings Inc.'s SIRI[2] satellite radio service.<nl/>In order to boost 
its Florida gateways during winter months, JetBlue has decided to run 95 flights daily at the FLL Airport. Moreover, 
the company's South Florida region also serves as an important hub for JetBlue flights connecting Latin American 
cities.<nl/>Recent Reuters reports reveal JetBlue's plans to add a second charter flight service from New York's 
John F. Kennedy airport to Havana. This non-stop, round-trip service, starting Dec 1, 2015, will be offered on every 
Tuesday in coordination with Cuba Travel Services.<nl/>Hence, we believe that increased flight frequency coupled 
with low fares will enhance traveling options apart from boosting passenger revenues for JetBlue.<nl/>JetBlue

Sep 30, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Ryanair Holdings 
plc (RYAAY[1]) is a company in the Transport - Airline space that could be an interesting play for investors. That is 
because, not only does the stock have decent short-term momentum, but it is seeing solid activity on the earnings 
estimate revision front as well.<nl/>
<nl/> These positive earnings estimate revisions suggest that analysts are becoming more optimistic on RYAAY's 
earnings for the coming quarter and year. In fact, consensus estimates have moved sharply higher for both of these 
time frames over the past four weeks, suggesting that Ryanair Holdings could be a solid choice for 
investors.<nl/><nl/> Current Quarter Estimates for RYAAY<nl/><nl/> In the past 30 days, 2 estimates have gone 
higher for Ryanair Holdings while none have gone lower in the same time period. The trend has been pretty 
favorable too, with estimates increasing from $2.87 a share 30 days ago, to $3.21 a share today, a move of 
11.8%.<nl/><nl/> Current Year Estimates for RYAAY<nl/><nl/> Meanwhile, Ryanair Holdings' current year figures 
are also looking quite promising, with 4 estimates moving higher in the past month, compared to none lower. The 
consensus estimate trend has also seen a boost for this time frame, increasing from $4.01 per share 30 days ago to 
$4.81 per share today, an increase of about 20%.<nl/><nl/> Bottom Line<nl/><nl/> The stock has also started to 
move higher lately, adding 7.4% over the past four weeks, suggesting that investors are starting to take note of this 
impressive story. So investors may definitely want to consider this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock to profit in the 
near future.<nl/><nl/> Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can

Sep 30, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> GOL Linhas 
Aereas Inteligentes S.A. GOL[1] posted a decline in air traffic for the month of August this year. Traffic - measured 
in revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) - stood at 3.05 billion, down 2% from 3.12 billion recorded a year ago.<nl/>
Also, on a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat kilometres /ASKs) inched down 0.3% to 
4.04 billion mainly because of a 0.6% drop in domestic capacity. However, international capacity improved 2.2%. 
Likewise, international RPK for the month inched up 3.5% while the domestic figure fell 2.8%.<nl/>Meanwhile, the 
load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers fell to 75.7% from 77% recorded in Aug 2014. GOL's 
strategy to trim down domestic capacity may allow it to improve the load factor.<nl/>At the end of the first eight 
months of 2015, RPK hiked 5.3% while ASK climbed 3%. Load factor for the same period inched up 
1.7%.<nl/>Adverse conditions in the Brazilian economy coupled with foreign currency headwinds owing to the 
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real have largely resulted in the dismal performance. 
Moreover, in Aug 2015, the carrier witnessed a 7.5% drop in passenger count.<nl/>Meanwhile, we expect such 
factors to prevail in the near future as well.<nl/>Zacks Rank ...ocks to Consider<nl/>GOL Linhas currently carries a 
Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Better-stocks in the same industry are JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU[2], Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[3] and Delta Air Lines DAL[4]. All three sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).<nl/>Want the latest

to you, it's very hard to sit up here and choose a 'Bull of the Day' when it seems like it's hitting the fan from every 
direction right now. First it was energy, then China, then biotech, now healthcare. 
There seems to be nowhere to hide in this market right now, other than under the desk. Well I'm a big guy and it's 
not too spacious down there so I propose an alternate solution; search for the strength.<nl/><nl/>The airline 
industry is in the top 9% of the 265 industries we rank with our Zacks Industry Rank. Among the Zacks Rank #1 
(Strong Buy) stocks to choose from is our 'Bull of the Day' Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY[1]). Ryanair operates an ultra-
low cost, scheduled airline serving short-haul, point-to-point routes between Ireland, the United Kingdom, 
Continental Europe and Morocco. The company's principle fleet consists of Boeing 737-800 aircraft.<nl/><nl/>Click 
'FOLLOW THE AUTHOR' above for free weekly stock picks!!! Twitter @bartosiastics[2]<nl/><nl/>Over the last thirty 
days, three analysts have upped their earnings estimates for the current year and next year. The bullish attitude has 
pushed up the Zacks Consensus estimate to $4.77 from $3.85 for the current year and up from $4.34 to $5.41 for 
next year. Those upward revisions are a big reason for the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This stock also happens to 
be blessed with a Zacks Momentum Style Score of 'A' making it very attractive at these levels.<nl/><nl/><nl/>With 
the market seeming to crumble around it, shares of Ryanair has remained resilient. A great earnings report last 
October was the catalyst that started the uptrend that began in the mid-$50s and has gone through to the low $80s. 
The last few rocky trading days have sent shares retreating from the highs but the fall from grace hasn't been too 
harsh. Shares found buyers stepping back in at the $78 level. The commodity channel index has come down from 
an extremely overbought level over 200 to cross below the zero line. It may be best to wait for the CCI to dip below 
-100 then come back a bit before jumping in headfirst.<nl/><nl/>Be sure to click FOLLOW THE AUTHOR above to

Sep 29, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> For Immediate 
Release<nl/> Chicago, IL - September 29, 2015- Zacks Equity Research[1] highlights Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY[2]) 
as the Bull of the Day and Halliburton (HAL[3]) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides 
analysis on JPMorgan Chase .... (JPM[4]), Citigroup Inc. 
(C[5]) and Wells Fargo ...mpany ( WFC[6]).<nl/><nl/> Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:<nl/><nl/> Bull of the 
Day[7]: <nl/><nl/> I'm not going to lie to you, it's very hard to sit up here and choose a 'Bull of the Day' when it

happens to be blessed with a Zacks Momentum Style Score of 'A' making it very attractive at these levels.<nl/><nl/> 
Bear of the Day[10] :<nl/><nl/> When I'm looking for a stock to be my 'Bear of the Day' I look for weak stocks in a 
weak industry. So you see it's easy for me to look at a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in an industry that ranks in the 
bottom 18% of the 265 industries we rank with our Zacks Industry Rank, and find myself a bearish idea. But when 
that stock also happens to be in the energy business that's taken the biggest hit this year, I almost feel like I'm 
making it too obvious.<nl/><nl/> Falling crude prices have put pressure on companies across the energy sector. 
Today's 'Bear of the Day,' Halliburton ( HAL[11]), is one of the world's largest providers of products and services to 
the energy industry. The company serves the upstream oil and gas industry throughout the lifecycle of the reservoir. 
It's no wonder that business would be struggling as oil is becoming cheaper and cheaper as more is brought to 
market.<nl/><nl/> Click 'FOLLOW THE AUTHOR' above for free weekly stock picks!!! Twitter @bartosiastics[12] 
<nl/><nl/> You don't have to take my word for it. Recently, ten analysts have revised their earnings estimates to the 
Ryanair Holdings, Halliburton , JPMorgan Chase , Citigroup and Wells Fargo highlighted as Zacks Bull and 
Bear of the Day
downside for the current year, while eleven have done so for next year. Most of that bearish change took place 
between thirty and sixty days ago. But in the last week, another round of negative revisions have come through, 
dropping the Zacks Consensus Estimates even further. Currently, the consensus for the current year has gone from 
$1.68 to $1.60, while next year's number has fallen from $1.95 to $1.71.<nl/><nl/> Additional content:<nl/><nl/> 
Energy Lending Now a Major Burden for Banks?<nl/><nl/> The rippling effects of the plunge in oil prices over the 
past year continue to hit harder on the banking sector. Energy lending, which once aided the U.S. oil boom, now 
seems to give jitters to banks as they face continuous regulatory pressure to limit exposure in the sector.<nl/><nl/> 
Concern arises on the fact that amid the still low oil prices, credit quality of the loans made to the energy companies 
will continue to deteriorate, which may ultimately hit bank's profitability. This is because higher provisioning to cover 
the bad loans of the energy companies is likely to shrink the banks' overall earnings.<nl/> <nl/> A report released 
by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in June 2015, on Semiannual Risk Perspective, placed oil 
and gas lending on the top of its list of risks that demand awareness among bankers and examiners. It stated that, 
'The significant decline in oil prices in 2014 could put pressure on loan portfolios in the oil and gas production and 
services sector.'<nl/> <nl/> Regarding credit underwriting, the report highlighted, 'where indicated, examiners will 
also assess banks' actions to assess, monitor, and manage both direct and indirect exposures to the oil and gas 
sector, given the recent decline in oil prices and the potential for a protracted period of low or volatile prices.'<nl/> 
<nl/> Banks extend loans to energy companies on the basis of the value of their oil and natural gas reserves. Owing 
to the acute drop in oil prices, which is currently trading below the key psychological level of $50-a-barrel, after 
hitting new 6-1/2 year low of $37.75 last month, the worth of several of those reserves dropped to around half 
compared to previous year.<nl/> <nl/> Banks adjust the revolving credit lines, termed 'redetermination,' twice a year 
which is generally around April and October. Notably, the redeterminations of these reserve-based loans, which are 
expected to occur this fall are likely to hit the small and midcap exploration and production companies harder 
compared to the larger-cap companies because the smaller companies depend more on bank debt placing the 
energy reserves as collateral.<nl/> <nl/> Banks, which have extended credit to troubled energy firms in order to 
avoid large amounts of defaults, are however tightening their finding pipeline to these companies. Amid regulatory 
pressure, banks have commenced their fall reviews on the collateral quality placed by the small and mid-sized 
firms.<nl/> <nl/> The Concerns<nl/> <nl/> Banks, which continue to embrace stricter rules and regulations post 
crisis, are currently in a rift with regulators with loan reviews in the energy portfolio.<nl/> <nl/> Notably, the issues 
came into light after major U.S regulators - the OCC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the 
Federal Reserve Board, increased their scrutiny on the banks that lend to the energy sector, as a part of the Shared 
National Credit (SNC) review program that is currently underway.<nl/><nl/> Notably, earlier this month the 
regulators met with several energy bankers from companies including JPMorgan Chase .... (JPM[13]), Citigroup Inc. 
(C[14]) and Wells Fargo ...mpany ( WFC[15]). According to a recent report by the Wall Street Journal, the banks 
raised concern as regulators' spring review rated several reserve-based loans as more risky than the banks had 
contemplated.<nl/> <nl/> In their standing, the banks have explained why reserve-based loans resemble lower-risk, 
asset-based loans. They also raised question about the OCC's consideration of an energy company's total debt 
when evaluating reserve-based loans, which are usually paid earlier than other debt in case there is a 
restructuring.<nl/><nl/> Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can

JetBlue : Another Cuba -Bound Charter Flight Coming Up?

Sep 28, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Low-cost carrier 
JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU[1] recently announced a second charter flight from New York's John F. Kennedy 
airport to Havana, as per Reuters reports. 
<nl/>This non-stop, round-trip service starting Dec 1, 2015 will be offered every Tuesday in coordination with Cuba 
Travel Services, a leading provider of carrier services - a unit licensed by the U.S. government for arranging travel 
services to the island.<nl/>Notably, JetBlue is the first carrier to announce direct charter flights on the New York-
Havana route after the U.S. government announced its decision to ease travel restrictions to Cuba.<nl/>The easing 
of the restrictions, after over 50 years, will significantly increase travel demand as Cuba had been a popular tourist 
spot for Americans before the embargo was imposed in 1962. Meanwhile, carriers like Delta Air Lines DAL[2] and

Sep 25, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> One stock that 
might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY[1]). This is because this 
security in the Transport-Airline space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity, and is in great company 
from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective.<nl/><nl/> This is important because, often times, a rising tide will lift all 
boats in an industry, as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the 
board. 
This is arguably taking place in the Transport-Airline industry as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 31 out of 
more than 250 industries, suggesting it is well-positioned from this perspective, especially when compared to other 
segments out there.<nl/><nl/> Meanwhile, Ryanair Holdings is actually looking pretty good on its own too. The firm 
has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month, suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more 
bullish on the firm's prospects in both the short and long term.<nl/><nl/> In fact, over the past month, current 
quarter estimates have risen from $2.87 per share to $2.97 per share, while current year estimates have risen from 
$4.01 per share to $4.58 per share. The company currently holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which is also a 
favorable signal.<nl/><nl/> So, if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry, consider Ryanair Holdings. 
Not only is its industry currently in the top third, but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late, suggesting it could 
be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment.<nl/><nl/> Want the latest

The Innovative GatwickConnects Allows You to Connect Between Airlines

Sep 24, 2015( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Ultra low cost carriers are 
great at bringing low fares to places, but they don't really help connect people into the broader air travel network. 
None of these airlines interline with other carriers, and a good number don't even allow you to connect between 
flights on that airline. London's Gatwick airport has partnered with Dohop[1] to do something really interesting. 
It has taken its previous Gatwick Connect program and put it on steroids. The new service is called 
GatwickConnects[2] and it's like a strange hybrid travel agent/ground service provider/insurance company. It's 
awesome, and I can only hope that US airports will consider something similar. Let's walk through how this thing 
works.<nl/> In the US, Spirit and Frontier sell connecting flights, but they don't work with other airlines. In Europe, 
the big ultra low cost carriers are even more strict. They operate more like Allegiant here in the US. Ryanair and 
easyJet don't allow connections to be booked on the same ticket at all. If you want to connect, you have to buy two 
separate tickets and you'll get no help connecting your bags. If things go wrong? Tough luck.<nl/> For Gatwick 
Airport, this is a problem. Gatwick has become a major hub for leisure travel in the UK. easyJet is the largest airline 
with 41 percent of passengers[3], but British Airways is second with 15 percent. You get a big mix of short and long 
haul carriers in there, but published connections are few and far between since most airlines there don't work with 
each other or even with themselves. Despite all that, an increasing number of people had begun building their own 
connections because the fares were so good.<nl/> Gatwick saw an opportunity to help those people and boost 
traffic further by finding a way to allow those connections to happen more easily. It first launched Gatwick 
Connect[4] in May 2013. Previously if you wanted to build your own connections, you could. But you had to claim 
your own bags, take them to the ticket counter, re-check them, and then go through security. That was a real pain, 
especially if one airline was in the North Terminal and the other in the South Terminal.<nl/> The original Gatwick 
Connect had a desk in the baggage claim area that acted like a bag re-check you find with international carriers 
elsewhere. Once you claimed your bag, you walked over to the desk and they re-tagged it and took it to your next 
flight. In effect, Gatwick was creating an interline arrangement through its own devices. You could also get your 
boarding pass for your connection if you didn't have it yet. This eliminated the need to go to the ticket counter at all. 
You could just head back through security and on to your connecting gate.<nl/> But that only solved part of the 
problem. You still had to go buy your own tickets separately, building your own connections. You were also on your 
own if you had delays or cancellations. So, the airport put Gatwick Connect on steroids, removed all sense of 
proper word-spacing, and created GatwickConnects. It kept the original bag service (which is still free for people 
The Innovative GatwickConnects Allows You to Connect Between Airlines That Don't Work Together Without 
the Risk
who buy their own connections), but it created a service to make it more seamless.<nl/> To tackle the separate 
ticket issue, Gatwick worked with Dohop. Dohop already self-builds connections in its system so that was easy. 
Now when you search Dohop, GatwickConnects will come up as an online travel agent option on those flights that 
connect through Gatwick. But keep in mind this only works for sale in the UK, Norway, and Iceland right now. That's 
going to change, but you have to change your country in the upper right if you want to see it today. (The Gatwick-
branded site is at dohop.com/gatwick, but I don't think you can change your country there. So just use the regular 
Dohop site.) You'll see a result like this:<nl/><nl/>You can see that Dohop shows you an option to buy separate 
tickets, but if you pay more, you get GatwickConnects looking like another online travel agency. When you click it, 
you go off to the Gatwick Airport website where you see this:<nl/><nl/>The cost of this service is GBP 27.50 per 
person for a one way or GBP 40 per person for a roundtrip. You buy the tickets in a single transaction via 
GatwickConnects, but you're really getting three things. You get one ticket on Wow, one on easyJet, and then you 
get the GatwickConnects service. If you need to make changes or anything, you'd come back to GatwickConnects 
to handle, just as you would with another online travel agent.<nl/> That's helpful to have it done all it one place, but 
is it really worth the extra cost when you could just book it on your own? There are a couple of extra benefits here. 
First, you get priority security to make it easier to get back to your next gate. You also get a luggage tracking 
service. But most important is what the airport calls a 'Protected Connection' service. This is like travel 
insurance.<nl/> My biggest issue with building self-connections is that if something goes wrong on the first flight, the 
second airline isn't going to care. You lose the ticket and have to find your own way to the destination, paying 
whatever fare is out there to make it happen. That's why I've seen plenty of people shy away from building their own 
connections. The risks involved are too great.<nl/> GatwickConnects, however, treats the connection like a regular 
online connection at a legacy carrier. If you miss your flight, GatwickConnects will put you on the next one without 
cost. It'll also put you up in a hotel, give you meal vouchers, etc. As is always the case, there's bunch of fine print 
here, but it generally matches what you find with standard connections. For example, they won't do this if the 
reason for the misconnection is outside of the airline's control (weather, strike, air traffic control, etc). You can see 
all the restrictions here[5]. <nl/> Of course, there may not be a connecting flight for days, in theory. And flights could 
be full. So GatwickConnects can't make this a perfect solution. But it's still a good insurance-style option that would 
make me feel much more confident about booking a connection on airlines that don't work together.<nl/> So far this 
works for easyJet, Norwegian, Virgin Atlantic, Thomas Cook, Flybe, and WOW. That means once this gets 
expanded beyond the UK/Norway/Iceland point-of-sale, people in the US who have Virgin Atlantic service to 
Gatwick (Florida and Vegas) can build their own connections with these other carriers and have it all protected 
through GatwickConnects.<nl/> This is a really innovative idea. Just imagine what would happen if an airport like 
Las Vegas did this. Think of all the small communities with Allegiant service that could be better connected into 
global airline networks. It's not perfect, but it would take the reliance on airline interline agreements away. And that's 
great for consumers.<nl/> [ 1]: http://www.dohop.com/ [ 2]:            http://www.prnewswire.com/news-

 Volume was tracking sharply lower. Declining stocks led advancers by 7-to-5 on the Nasdaq and 8-to-5 on the

(OTCPK:VLKAY[1]) bounced 6% after CEO Martin Winterkorn resigned, saying "Volkswagen needs a fresh

week after presidential candidate Hillary Clinton attacked what she called "price gouging" in the industry.<nl/> In the 
travel and leisure area, a couple of leaders were higher.<nl/> Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY[5]) hit a new high, but 
pared its gain to 1%. Shares of the Ireland-based airline have been trending higher thanks to strong passenger 
traffic in Europe, which caused Ryanair to raise its full-year profit guidance.<nl/> Carnival (NYSE:CCL[6]) climbed 
nearly 3% in about double its average volume. The cruise line operator topped analyst estimates Tuesday, but 
shares slid on weak Q4 guidance. Reports said analysts made bullish comments after the profit report, which 
helped shares recover. The stock is forming a base.<nl/> Fleetmatics Group (NYSE:FLTX[7]) climbed nearly 3% in 
active trading and is near the 52.55 buy point of a cup-shaped base. The stock's relative strength line is already at a

Sep 22, 2015( Slugger O'Toole: http://www.sluggerotoole.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> After the very first 
episode of House of Cars[1] - a BBC NI documentary looking at life for the sales force at Charles Hurst Group 
Boucher Road - over on Twitter Newton Emerson quickly drew a comparison between one sales manager and the 
Fast Show's comedy salesman Swiss Toni.<nl/>And therein lies the problem: on the show the salespeople talk 
about sales and the managers demand even more sales (or else) while Twitter and Facebook users find reasons to 
mock and the customer….well, according to social media the customer could be forgiven for feeling lost in the 
noise.<nl/> While BBC NI (through Erica Starling Productions[2] have produced a documentary which has attracted 
plenty of conversation and a lot of social media chatter, most has not been complimentary about the company 
featured. 
Many social media posters have been wondering what the aggressive, Darwinian management style shown at 
times - including swearing at staff and pitting sales staff against each other - says about their place as a 
customer.<nl/> At the time of writing from approximately 140 Tweets, easily two thirds were either poking fun at or 
criticising the behaviour of some of the people featured. Tweeters stated that they wouldn't buy a car from the 
company or even wondered why the firm had agreed to take part in filming in the first place.<nl/> Over on 
Facebook, from around 45 posts on the Charles Hurst page some praise for the show could be found, especially for 
some of the young salespeople and newcomers, but still a large number of people voicing the same concerns as 
most Twitter posters about what they'd seen.<nl/> All in all, while Charles Hurst made an annual pre-tax profit of 
£8.7m at the last count[3], most social media users seemed to wonder if, image-wise, this was a lost deal.<nl/> In 
episode one we saw a very highly-motivated sales manager deliver a buzzword pep talk and explain how he 
cleared out his 'rubbish' old sales-team, then tell a young salesman that he'd be sent home if he came to work 
unshaven. He followed this with various other 'shape up or ship out' high-pressure statements some Twitter users 
compared to the style of David Brent.<nl/> A famous Richard Branson quote tells us that staff should be trained well 
enough to leave but also treated so well they prefer to stay, thereby creating low staff turnover. It is probably safe to 
assume which of the two options the paying 'punter' would prefer.<nl/> Which brings us to the elephant in the room: 
particularly in the earlier episodes, we saw very little talk of the most valuable commodity of all…the customer.<nl/> 
The closest at first came about when a salesman was given a sales 'process' to make his own and apply when 
dealing with a customer. Or else. Sales rules included an instruction to keep talking to the customer during a test 
drive and training given to attempt a close to get the business 'today'.<nl/> I wonder if a number of potential 
customers, after seeing the headings including 'GAP', 'Warranty' etc above the sales board columns and the efforts 
TV review: 20,000 cars sold per year..but was House of Cars a deal or a gamble for Hursts?
made ensure they are kept filled, will have second thoughts about the advice of a salesperson advising on these 
add-ons after they have been shown what is at stake.<nl/> To digress for a second: I've been 'processed' twice by 
big name car sellers in Northern Ireland. It was not a good experience, from the embarrassingly transparent and 
manipulative generic sales lines to the downright disingenuous, such as 'there have been people looking at that car 
all day' (points at freezing cold car with no rain underneath) and onwards to repeatedly pretending not to hear when 
I realised a car's service book had been lost.<nl/> The 'process' was cold, impersonal, did absolutely nothing to 
reflect my needs as a customer and instead left a 'never, ever again' feeling, a promise that I didn't want to see any 
of the disinterested staff ever again. I went back to small, country garages who live and die on their personal 
reputation and then aim - successfully - to gain customers for life. There are a few of these places with such a 
phenomenal reputation that they never have to close a deal as their customer loyalty does all the work. Have a look 
at a Ballymena church car park and you'll see what I mean.<nl/> As for the reasons behind taking part in the House 
of Cars filming, the likes of Ryanair benefit from the 'no such thing as bad publicity' theory. After all, stories such as 
charging to use a bathroom associate their brand with cheapness, and not entirely in a bad way. But how could that 
possibly apply to the expensive product sold in this case?<nl/> Closer to home, to compare House of Cars to, say, 
the documentary about the Europa Hotel, the difference was that we were left with an affectionate feel for the 
Europa after that show. But how is the customer to feel about the subject of House of Cars, especially following the 
earlier, more sales-based episodes?<nl/> There were some startling statements made during the series: 
salespeople who are given crisps and energy drinks to 'fill them up with shit', a salesman who said the internet had 
made it harder to use smoke and mirrors to 'make something look good', a staff member told to keep an eye on 
what colleagues are doing to beat their sales, a hope that another staff member would become more 
'ruthless'….then a pep talk about the importance of working as a team.<nl/> The actual documentary itself was very 
watchable in its own way, with the stars of the show providing plenty of material, although as - again - pointed out 
by Newton Emerson on Twitter, the repeated breathless obsession with the size of the Charles Hurst operation 
('biggest car lot in Europe') was a little bizarre.<nl/> As it happens, as the show moved through episodes two and 
three it began, with some occasional f-word laden 'staff coaching', to draw out the personalities of the likable 
younger salespeople and even settled down to a fascinating scratch below the surface by way of wandering into the 
psychology and motivation of one sales manager.<nl/> Bosses spoke fondly of their young protégés, one 
particularly aggressive sales manager could be seen enjoying more rapport and chemistry with his staff and we 
were able to follow a fledgling young salesman growing in confidence after his first sale: much to the obvious and 
genuine pride of his boss.<nl/> We also heard a little more reference to the customers themselves, some young 
salespeople were told their salary and perks (£25,000 to £40,000, plus demo car) made them a fortunate group for 
their age and we had the interesting diversion of a promotional video shoot for a new Toyota Aygo car[4].<nl/> But 
back on social media and, I'd imagine, in canteens around Northern Ireland, the talk seemed to be stuck on episode 
one, with an ironic and negative House of Cars Fan Club tweet account also now in full flow.<nl/> One Tweeter 
made the fascinating point that they'd be watching the response of mainstream media to the show with 
interest.<nl/> As the final episode was showing the rapidly expanding[5] Charles Hurst Group had been creating a 
buzz in the media about the further growth[6] of their company. Requests from myself for their input into this piece 
weren't answered.<nl/> Ultimately, the fascinating question is this: whether a business taking part in a fly-on-the-
wall documentary is gambling with their image? For the likes of Ryanair and the Europa Hotel, it seems to have 
paid off. Opinions about how the brand shown in House of Cars has faired from the exposure seem to be very 
mixed, at best.<nl/> A book I read recently about copy writing claimed that a reader is only interested in one 
thing…themselves. While House of Cars successfully showed us the lengths the company featured will go to in 
driving staff, sales and profit, some customers seem to have been left wondering if the focus of the show should 
have been on how the firm works to make happy customers, not happy sales managers.<nl/><nl/>

Sep 14, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Low-cost carrier 
JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU[1] witnessed a significant improvement in air traffic for Aug 2015. Traffic - measured in 
revenue passenger miles (RPMs) - came in at 3.97 billion, up 6.7% from 3.72 billion recorded a year ago.<nl/>
On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) increased 8.3% to 4.56 billion. 
However, the load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers decreased to 87% from 88.3% in Aug 2014. 
The greater increase in capacity compared to traffic led to a decrease in load factor. <nl/>With the Labor Day 
holiday falling late this year, PRASM (a measure of unit revenue: passenger revenue per available seat mile) for 
August naturally suffered and declined 3% year over year. We note that the Labor Day holiday period (Sep 2-8) this 
year fell entirely in September. The Long Island City, NY-based carrier expects this key metric to display a change 
in the band of -0.5% to +0.5% in the third quarter of 2015 on a year-over-year basis.<nl/>For the first eight months 
of 2015, JetBlue generated RPMs of 28.06 billion (up 9.2% year over year) and ASMs of 32.81 billion (up 8.7%). 
Further, the load factor in the period improved 40 basis points to 85.5%.<nl/>We note that the decline in load factor 
for August is not unique to JetBlue. Other American carriers like United Continental Holdings UAL[2] and Delta Air 
Lines DAL[3] also reported a fall in their respective load factors for August as traffic growth was outpaced by 
capacity increase.<nl/>Zacks Rank<nl/>JetBlue has been witnessing positive estimate revisions of late thanks to its 
expansion efforts, impressive growth prospects and the benefit of weak oil prices. The stock presently carries a 
Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).<nl/>Apart from JetBlue, investors interested in the airlines industry may also consider 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4], which too sports a Zacks Rank #1.<nl/>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks

Lufthansa flights expected to return to normal following strike injunction

<nl/> Germany's biggest airline has said that service should be back to normal after a court ordered striking pilots 
back to work. 
The court granted Lufthansa a temporary injunction against the work stoppage. A Lufthansa spokesperson said 
early on Thursday that Germany's flag carrier airline anticipated no further disruptions to its regular flight 
schedule.<nl/> "We expect normal flight service without any cancellations," the spokesperson said.<nl/> This 
comes a day after a regional labor court in Frankfurt, where Lufthansa has its headquarters, ruled in favor of 
management and ordered the pilots, represented by the Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) trade union to return to 
work.<nl/> The decision by the regional court overturned an earlier verdict by the lower Frankfurt labor court, which 
on Tuesday evening had declined Lufthansa's request for an injunction.<nl/> The presiding judge found that not 
only was the union striking over early retirement provisions that the airline wants to cut, but was also seeking to 
influence the company's corporate strategy.<nl/> For months, the union and management have been at 
loggerheads over Lufthansa's creation and expansion of Eurowings, a low-cost subsidiary. As it is incorporated in 
Austria, it is not subject to German labor agreements reached through collective bargaining.<nl/> Lufthansa argues 
that it needs to reduce costs in order to fight off competition from budget air carriers such as Easyjet and 
Ryanair.<nl/> The latest walkout was the 13th by pilots represented by VC in the space of 18 months. It was also 
the first since March, when an Airbus operated by Lufthansa's Germanwings subsidiary crashed into a 
mountainside in the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board. <nl/> Lufthansa has put the cost of the strikes to 
the airline at more than 300 million euros ($334 million) over the past two years.<nl/> pfd/se (Reuters, dpa)<nl/>

http://www.lulegacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/legacy-16.jpgShares of discount carrier Ryanair soared on 
Wednesday after it hiked its profit forecast for the year by 25 pence, following a strong summer performance 
boosted by foul weather in the northern region of Europe, strength of the pound and higher prices.<nl/>
 The increase in the profit forecast was released on Wednesday through a trading update. The airline, which is due 
to give an update to its shareholders at its general meeting of shareholders September 24, said the strength of both 
July as well as August numbers, which are continuing into September, caused them to move the update 
forward.<nl/> Ryanair announced that the increase was due to many factors that included an increase in traffic that 
was higher than expected during the first six months of 2015; an increase in its fares; and growth in traffic during 
the third quarter.<nl/> The company however cautioned that its results for the full year would be heavily dependent 
upon close-in bookings for the third quarter, which currently is 30% sold and in the fourth quarter, which currently 
there is zero visibility.<nl/> Ryanair said it recovered all of its funds, which were part of a fraudulent transfer 
electronically to a bank in China back in April.<nl/> Michael O'Leary the CEO at Ryanair said the company was 
surprised by the strength of its close-in bookings as well as fares during the summer.<nl/> The CEO added that not 
all of the improvement is from our management or model, but the airline has clearly been a benefactor from industry 
trends that have been favorable during the summer.<nl/> That includes poor weather in Northern Europe, a strong 
sterling pound that encourages more families in the UK to go on vacation in the Mediterranean, capacity remaining 
reasonably flat in the EU and lower prices from un-hedged oil.<nl/> He added that the airline industry does not 
expect the favorable conditions to persist and urges shareholders and Wall Street analysts to avoid any over 
exuberance while the airline continues to execute it ambitious growth plan during a period of sustained fare wars in 
much of Europe this coming winter.<nl/>

Sep 09, 2015( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Ryanair has seen its 
profits take off after a great escape from Britain's damp summer combined with cheaper jet fuel to boost trading, 
reports The Telegraph[1].<nl/>
<nl/> The discount airline expects full-year profits to be in the range of €1.18bn to €1.23bn, which is 25 per cent 
higher than previous guidance.<nl/><nl/> Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said: 'We have been surprised by the 
strength of close-in bookings and fares this summer during which we delivered record 95 per cent load factors in 
both July and August while fares grew by over 2 per cent, when we had expected them to be flat.'<nl/><nl/> Mr 
O'Leary said the industry as a whole had benefited from bad weather across Northern Europe, stronger sterling, 
which encouraged more UK families to holiday in the Med, and falling jet fuel prices.<nl/><nl/>The strength of the 
trading forced Ryanair to make the announcement two weeks earlier than the planned update at the shareholder 
annual general meeting on September 24.<nl/> Mr O'Leary was cautious on the outlook for the full-year to the end 
of March, adding: 'Being the airline industry we do not expect these favourable conditions will persist, and we would 
urge shareholders and analysts to avoid irrational exuberance while we continue to execute our very ambitious 
growth plans during what we expect to be very attritional and sustained fare wars across Europe this winter.'<nl/> 
The Dublin-based airline first rolled out its 'Always Getting Better' campaign in 2014, with a renewed emphasis on 
'being nice' to customers[2]. It tripled its marketing spend to €35m and cut some of its most notorious fees, such as 
charging

Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn<nl/><nl/>What's This?
<nl/><nl/>Ryanair on Wednesday revised its profit forecast, bringing it to a whopping 47%. The low cost model is 
something we all appreciate as consumers; the market does too.<nl/> The company is now valued at € 18,8 bn and 
is the fifth most valuable carrier in the world. This story is often narrated as the story of a heroic CEO[1] who picked 
up a few tricks from Southwest Airlines Co. in the US, the third most valuable company in the world. In this story a 
company went from one aircraft and 5,000 passengers to Europe's biggest discount carrier, with more passengers 
than its main rivals combined, that is, 104 million people.<nl/> A full service carrier - Air France-KLM - with nearly 
five times Ryanair's revenue stream, that is 25 € bn, is valued €2 bn. But, the market values at € 18,8 bn a 
company that can guarantee profit margins rather than revenue stream by lowering airport costs, reducing space in 
cabins, taking on unions, unbundling the services offered by full service carriers, charging separately for luggage, 
food, and drinks, etc.<nl/> Ryanair is also known for taking on trade unions across Europe.<nl/> In July, Ryanair 
initiated a public online campaign aimed at banning the right to strike of air traffic controllers, entitled 'Keep 
Europe's Skies Open[2]'. The company aimed at obtaining the one million petition signatures required to 'urge' the 
EU Commission and the European Parliament to take action. The company wants nothing less than removing the 
right to strike from ATC unions, bringing Europe in line with the US regime.<nl/> Later the same month, the 
company proceeded to what is in effect a 'lockout' closing down its base in Denmark, Copenhagen, to resettle in 
Kaunus, Lithuania. The Danish Confederation of Trade Unions (LO) responded by saying that strikes against 
Ryanair will take place not only in Copenhagen but also in Billund and Aarhus. The company warned that Ryanair 
would respond in kind, shutting down bases in Denmark.<nl/> As it is also known that Ryanair has been 
investigated and cautioned by the European Commission multiple times[3] for its practices. Most recently, it was 
found that Ryanair was in the business of knocking on the door of regional governments thirsting for tourism to elicit 
subsidies for using their region's airports, thereby creating conditions that the European Commission considers[4] 
'an undue economic advantage' or 'distortion of competition.'<nl/> Now Brussels is demanding a € 6.3 million refund 
from Ryanair over the use of Nimes airport in southern France, €2.4 million euros over the use of the Pau Pyrenees 
airport, and €420,000 for the use of the Angouleme airport in central France. To ensure that the company will cough 
back the money, the European Commission has referred France to the European Court of Justice.<nl/> A company 
which takes labour market regulation or indeed open market rules to their legal limits is now Europe's most 
profitable company. It is because of tumbling oil prices, careful pricing, but also because it competes in a manner 
that is often scrutinized for its conformity to EU and national legislation. Indeed, it's cheap, but at a price.<nl/>

<nl/> A walkout by the pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit is set to affect around 140,000 would-be passengers after 
Lufthansa failed to stop it via a court injunction. 
A deputy of Merkel's caucus calls the strike "dangerous." The pilot strike at Lufthansa has intensified as the airline 
attempted to prevent Wednesday's walkout via a court injunction.<nl/> However, labor courts in the German cities 
of Frankfurt and Cologne rejected the company's attempt to undermine the pilot union Vereinigung Cockpit's (VC) 
walkout.<nl/> Around 140,000 out of 180,000 would-be passengers are expected to be affected by the strike.<nl/> 
Nearly 1,000 of Lufthansa's scheduled 1,520 flights are expected to be cancelled. It is the 13th strike inside 18 
months at the airline.<nl/> <nl/> The dispute focuses on pensions and a planned austerity plan to allow the German 
airliner to compete with budget airlines such as Ryanair and Easy Jet by reducing tariffs.<nl/> "Despite the labor 
action, Lufthansa is able to offer 90 of the scheduled long-haul flights to its passengers and all cargo flights," the 
company said in a statement.<nl/> 'Highly dangerous'<nl/> Michael Fuchs, a deputy head of German Chancellor 
Angela Merkel's conservative caucus, told the German newspaper "Bild" on Wednesday that the pilots' actions 
were "dangerous."<nl/> "What the pilots are doing is highly dangerous," Fuchs said, adding that the union was 
jeopardizing the company's ability to face "tough international competition."<nl/> "It cannot be that hundreds of 
thousands are constantly held hostage to the interests of a small minority," Fuchs told the newspaper.<nl/> Fuchs 
noted that compulsory arbitration would be necessary in the future to prevent "recurring strikes."<nl/> Meanwhile, 
VC spokesperson Markus Wahl on Tuesday told reporters at Frankfurt airport that more strikes could be 
imminent.<nl/> "Until further notice, it is possible that every week there will be new actions," said Wahl.<nl/> 
Lufthansa has provided a special schedule for the strike, although passengers must search for their flights on the 
company's website to see whether they are affected.<nl/> ls/jr (AFP, dpa)<nl/>

Sep 09, 2015( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> European stocks 
have rallied for a second day in a row after markets in China appeared to stabilize and Japan's benchmark index 
Nikkei posted its biggest one-day gains since the 2008 financial crisis. 
The good news from Asia lifted Germany's DAX by 2.15 percent to 10,489.29 points in the first minutes of trading 
on Wednesday. The CAC 40 in Paris followed suit, shooting 2.37 percent higher to 4,707.41 points.<nl/> Outside 
the eurozone, London's FTSE 100 index gained 1.68 percent to 6,249.02 points. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 
300 jumped 2.1 percent in initial trade, lifted by a strong performance by the no-frills airline Ryanair, whose shares 
rose to an all-time high after the company raised its full-year profits outlook by 25 percent.<nl/> Earlier in the day, 
traders at the Tokyo Stock Exchange watched the benchmark index Nikkei 225 post its strongest gains in nearly 
seven years, rising 7.7 percent to 18,770.51 points.<nl/> The jump was significant because yesterday the index lost 
2.34 percent, wiping out all progress since the beginning of the year. Weak trade data from China had compounded 
investors' worries that the economic malaise of the world's second-largest economy could eventually spill over into 
other markets.<nl/> More 'Abenomics'<nl/> The Japanese index's rebound came after the country's Prime Minister 
Shinzo Abe, raised hopes that his government would do more to stimulate the economy. In remarks read aloud at a 
conference in Tokyo, Abe promised to slash corporate tax rates by 3.3 percent next year.<nl/> Investors were also 
emboldened after China's Ministry of Finance unveiled new measures aimed at reviving slumping growth, including 
more infrastructure spending and tax reforms for small businesses.<nl/> Those signs that Beijing was doing what 
was necessary to stabilize markets led to a rebound in Shanghai shares on Tuesday. US stocks also kept the 
momentum going and posted broad gains across the three major indexes.<nl/> "At long last we may be seeing a 
real rebound," Bloomberg News quoted Chihiro Ohta, the general manager at SMBC Nikko Securities, as saying of 
the upswing in Chinese shares.<nl/> cjc/uhe (AFP, Reuters, dpa, AP)<nl/>

<nl/> A labor court in the German state of Hesse has issued a temporary injunction against the pilots' union 
Vereinigung Cockpit, ordering Lufthansa pilots to halt their strike. 
The walkout is the 13th amid a pay dispute. The regional labor court in the German city of Frankfurt issued the 
injunction on Wednesday in response to an appeal by Lufthansa, which had earlier failed to stop the strike through 
the courts.<nl/> The court called the strike "unlawful," saying it was not directed at achieving a concrete goal with 
regard to wages, but rather against Lufthansa's plans to expand its budget airline subsidiaries.<nl/> Strikes that 
take aim at company policy without concrete pay or benefits objectives in view are not allowed under German 
law.<nl/> The pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit said Wednesday's ruling meant all pilots must immediately return to 
work. However, it remained unclear when flights would return to normal.<nl/> Flights canceled<nl/> The strike had 
led on Wednesday to the cancelation of some 1,000 flights and the grounding of 140,000 passengers, Lufthansa 
said.<nl/> The decision by the regional court overturned an earlier verdict by the lower Frankfurt labor court, which 
on Tuesday evening had declined Lufthansa's request for an injunction.<nl/> Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings 
has placed a similar request at a labor court in Cologne, which also declined to issue an injunction. The higher state 
labor court of North Rhine-Westphalia is reconsidering an appeal, but has yet to announce its decision.<nl/> Pilots 
from the union laid down their work on Tuesday in what is the 13th strike inside 18 months at the airline.<nl/> 
Controversial restructuring<nl/> The union and Lufthansa are embroiled in a longrunning dispute over pensions and 
a proposed austerity plan designed to allow the airline to reduce tariffs in a bid to better compete with budget 
companies such as Ryanair and Easy Jet.<nl/> The union has criticized Lufthansa's restructuring policy, which has 
seen the airline creating and expanding an Austria-based subsidiary, Eurowings, where pilots receive less pay. The 
subsidiary is taking over many routes formerly flown by Lufthansa in a bid to cut costs.<nl/> tj/ (Reuters, dpa,

Reuters<nl/>Via Dave Lutz at JonesTrading, here's a super quick guide to what traders are talking about before 
markets open on Wednesday. <nl/>
 Good Morning! US Futures are continuing their enthusiasm from yesterday, with the S...arked up over 1% early as 
European markets rocket higher in trading. The DAX is up 1.8%, and EU Stoxx up 2% in solid volume as Miners are 
en fuego, Glencore and Anglo +5%, and Airlines flying on Ryanair Guidance. Consumer Discretionary shares in 
Franktfurt are surging nearly 3% as traders look to the epicenter of the Rally - Asia. The Nikkei leapt 7.7%, its 
biggest 1day surge since 2008 on several chattered reasons for rally: S... 2.5% bounce yesterday; China's MoF 
chattering fiscal policy stimulus; weak Chinese data has EM doves hoping that the FOMC does not raise next week, 
and finally Japan's Abe saying Corporate Taxes to be slashed in 2016 coupled with BOJ talking lower inflation 
outlook and reiterating stimulus efforts causing that heavy short positioning on the TSE to cover quickly. Shanghai 
rose 2.3%, Aussie rose 2.1% led by the big Banks, while South Korea added 3% and Hong Kong nearly 4%. Except 
for Indonesia, all Emerging Markets rallied 1%+ higher.<nl/> While the press seems to be focused on weak Chinese 
data pushing off the FOMC next week, the Treasury market is positioning for liftoff in 7 sessions - The 10YY has 
gotten back upside 2.2%, and that 'Policy Sensitive' 2YY up 2bp to 4year highs as hawks take charge and heavy IG 
issuance is planned into the Liftoff date. Stops are smacking the Euro lower, while the BOJ comments are 
weakening Yen quickly - boosting the DXY to week's highs, causing a headwind for commodities. That said, most 
Industrial commodities remain bid, led by Lumber, Nickel, Zinc and Copper. Gold remains under pressure, and is 
rolling to test week's lows - while the Oil complex is giving back much of yesterday's rally, with WTI off over 1% into 
inventory data. Those 'Softs' are enjoying heavy inflows into WASDE data later this week, with all Agriculture 
commodities in the green <nl/> Ahead of us today, we get Housing Starts from Canada at 8:15, followed by the 
Bank of Canada interest rate announcement and US JOLTS Job Openings at 10. DOE's Short-term Outlook is 
released at noon, just before the US Treasury auctions off $21B in 10Y notes at 1pm. At the same time, the Apple 
event at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco kicks off. After the close, we get API inventories for the 
Crude Complex at 4:30 (DOE data tomorrow). While there are am pile of meets on Capitol Hill today - none seemed 
impactful at first blush. We get the Kiwi rate decision later tonight - Weak commodities and collapsing milk prices 
have the pressure on to ease…<nl/>NOW WATCH: How to invest like Warren Buffett[1]<nl/>See Also: 94-year-old

Sep 09, 2015( Travel.India.com: http://travel.india.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> India's national carrier may not 
exactly be having a great year but does it make it to the list of worst airlines in the world? Find out here!<nl/>
 Tuesday was clearly not Air India's day.<nl/> Two flights made emergency landings at New Delhi's Indira Gandhi 
International Airport on the day.<nl/> First was the incoming flight from Varanasi, AI 405, which reported hydraulic 
failure. And then there was the Bagdogra-bound AI 879[1] that had to turn around because a tyre burst while taking 
off.<nl/> Hydraulic failure and tyre burst! We're going to let that sink in for a second.<nl/> Fact is that Air India isn't 
the first airline of choice for several young Indians and the fact that dead insects[2] occasionally make their way into 
the meals doesn't help much.<nl/> But by no standards is Air India the worst airline in the world. In fact it isn't even 
in the worst 15. Skytrax's latest ranking gives Air India a three-star rating,<nl/>same as Jet Airways and several 
other top airlines in the world.<nl/> The rankings did however reveal some of the worst airlines that are (somehow 
miraculously) flying in 2015.<nl/> So, without much ado, here's the infamous list:<nl/>15. US Airways<nl/><nl/> The 
American airline is the most preferred mode of flying for all those who want their baggage lost.<nl/> What's worse, 
not only do they lose your bags they also provide fairly terrible flights and p-r-e-t-t-y terrible customer 
service.<nl/>14. Frontier<nl/><nl/> Cancellations, delays… Frontier offers you everything you hate about 
flying.<nl/> What is perhaps sad about Frontier is that it was once a well-reputed airline that is now ailing thanks to 
cost-cutting measures.<nl/>13. United Airlines<nl/><nl/> Yet another American airline to appear on this dubious list 
is United.<nl/> UA's customer service is so bad the US Department of Transport fined them a million dollars to drive 
home the point. Sigh!<nl/>12. Tigerair<nl/><nl/> This Singapore-based low-cost airline initially served Singapore 
and Asia but has expanded its operations to include Australia in 2007.<nl/> This year, the federal government-
appointed airline ombudsman declared Tigerair as Australia's worst-performing airline… thrice in a row.<nl/> The 
airline has nonchalant about its ultra-low costs (which are not bad at all if you are travelling with minimal baggage) 
and its terrible pay scale for its<nl/>employees. But it seems keen to shed this image with its recent rebranding 
(from Tiger Airways to Tigerair).<nl/> Will it stick? Only time will tell.<nl/>11. EasyJet<nl/><nl/> If you are flying the 
UK-based Easyjet, don't expect any assistance whatsoever. While it does have fairly low prices, its services are 
lower still.<nl/>10. Pakistan International Airline<nl/><nl/> Rounding off the top ten is our very own neighbor's 
national carrier.<nl/> So far this year, PIA's on-time record is… and you may have to sit down for this… 40 per 
cent.<nl/> And considering that they fly just as little as around 3,000 flights every month, that is a terrible, terrible 
record indeed.<nl/> Skytrax also ranked their staff's language skills and other services.<nl/>9. Ryanair<nl/><nl/> 
Dublin-based Ryanair takes ultra low-cost to another level altogether.<nl/> They cram seats so close to each other 
you will forget what legroom is; their seats don't recline; and on some occasions they have known to have done 
Is Air India the WORST airline? List of worst 15 here!
away with extra bathrooms so they could accommodate more seats.<nl/> Care to fly?<nl/>8. China Eastern 
Airline<nl/><nl/> At about 50 per cent, Shanghai-based China Eastern Airline's on-time arrival is only slightly better 
than Pakistan International Airline.<nl/> But when you consider the fact that they fly some 50,000 flights a month 
you will realize just how big a problem that is. 25,000 flights of China Eastern Airline don't land on time. Every. 
Single. Month.<nl/>7. Lion Air<nl/><nl/> Lost baggage and flight delays should perhaps be the least of your 
concerns if you're flying Jakarta-based Lion Air.<nl/> In 2012 several crew members, including pilots, were tested 
positive for meth.<nl/>6. Smartwings<nl/><nl/> Then there is the Czech Republican airline Smartwings.<nl/> Lost 
baggage? Check! Flight cancellation? Check! Hidden fees? Check!<nl/> Now suddenly Air India doesn't seem so 
bad after all, does it?<nl/> Anyway, moving on…<nl/>5. Spirit Airlines<nl/><nl/> Considering that the new airline 
has been taking cue from some of the worst practices of Ryanair, it is no surprise that Spirit Airlines appears on this 
list.<nl/> And the fact that it outranks Ryanair says something.<nl/>4. Nepal Airlines<nl/><nl/> How difficult would it 
be to run an airline that has all of s-e-v-e-n functional aircraft in their fleet?<nl/> Very, very, very difficult it would 
seem. Because Nepal Airlines is so, so bad the EU banned it from flying its airspace in 2013.<nl/> Skytrax rated 
them a shameful one on the scale of five in almost every major category. Heck even their website received an 
abysmal one star!<nl/> And oh… only 30 per cent of their flights have arrived on time so far in 2015.<nl/>3. Bulgaria 
Airline<nl/><nl/> Now, if you are desperate (or quite simply travelling on a shoestring budget) you would most 
probably ignore all the typical airline problems — cramped seats, terrible loos, poor on-time performance — as long 
as they made sure you landed safely, right?<nl/> Bulgaria Airline manages to check that last box too.<nl/> Its safety 
policies are so bad, they have been banned from flying in US airspace! And they have a shabby two-star rating 
across all services (or the lack thereof) that they offer.<nl/> But what (we imagine) is the biggest problem with 
Bulgaria Airline is that their planes seem to skid more often than an amateur skater. Which we suppose is the 
scariest. thing. ever.<nl/>2. Pegasus<nl/><nl/> The second largest airline in Turkey, infamous for its passenger 
class on international flights that has no food and no entertainment, Pegasus had topped this dubious list in 2013 
and 2014.<nl/> We're not quite sure if anything improved for it to slip to number two because the airline that tops 
the list this year scored a shocking one on five star ranking on Skytrax's ratings.<nl/>1. Air Koryo<nl/><nl/> 
Welcome to Air Koryo that has the dubious distinction of being the only carrier to get a one-star rating on 
Skytrax.<nl/> Air Koryo has such a terrible safety and maintenance record that it was banned from flying from EU 
airspace. And even in 2010, only one particular model was permitted.<nl/> Like everything in North Korea, Air 
Koryo is sponsored by the state and is, somewhat miraculously, still flying!<nl/> Now, do you still have complaints 
about Air India? We didn't think so either! <nl/>The post Is Air India the WORST airline? List of worst 15 here![3]

Stock indexes were trading in the middle of the day's price range Tuesday afternoon while holding on to most of the 
gains from a strong open. 
The Nasdaq gripped a 1.7% gain while the S...00 clutched 1.6%. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.7%. 
Volume in the stock market today[1] was running roughly 10% higher on both major exchanges vs. Friday's quiet 
pace.<nl/> Blue chips were up without exception.<nl/> Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT[2]) pegged a 3% gain, the 
biggest percentage move in the Dow. However, Wal-Mart remains far off its January high, and the up-down volume 
ratio points to more institutional selling than buying.<nl/> About the only good angle to Wal-Mart's 23% stock-price 
decline this year is that the annualized dividend yield is now 3.1%. However, that alone is not a good reason to buy 
a stock.<nl/> Although the indexes were posting advances Tuesday, top-rated stocks weren't making much of a 
splash.<nl/> For example, only a handful of stocks with good ratings were posting new highs. They included 
homebuilder LGI Homes (NASDAQ:LGIH[3]), which rose 4%; engineering and services provider to telecoms Dycom 
Industries (NYSE:DY[4]), up 4.5%; and Irish airline Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY[5]), up 1.5%.<nl/> Among IBD's 197 
industry groups, the day's biggest gains were found in beaten-up groups such as miners, oil drillers and 
chipmakers. No industry groups were down, but a few showed only trivial gains.<nl/> Follow Paul Whitfield on

Strong Global Traffic Data in July, Fall Forecast Disappoints
Strong Global Traffic Data in July, Fall Forecast Disappoints

Sep 08, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> The monthly data 
released by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) revealed an 8.2% year-over-year increase in demand 
for air travel across the globe for the month of July 2015. The rise was attributable to an increase in both 
international and domestic traffic (measured in revenue passenger kilometers) in the month. Results were boosted 
by the timing of Ramadan this year. This year, only a part of Ramadan fell during July as opposed to 2014 when the 
holy period, which traditionally results in weak air travel, coincided entirely with the month of July.<nl/>
The report also revealed a 6.5% rise in capacity (measured in available seat kilometers or ASKs). The greater 
increase in air traffic compared with capacity resulted in the load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) 
improving 140 basis points (bps) to 83.6% in July.<nl/>International Traffic<nl/>The 8.6% increase in International 
demand was driven by strong performance of carriers across all regions including Africa, which had been a weak 
link till June this year.<nl/>International traffic in the Asia-Pacific region registered a handsome 8.5% growth on a 
6.5% rise in capacity. The greater increase in traffic compared with capacity led to a 150 bps rise in load factor to 
80.3%. Carriers in the Middle East, which include the likes of Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways, reported a 19.8% 
increase in July traffic due to the favorable Ramadan timing this year. Moreover, the lesser increase in capacity 
(17.7%) resulted in the load factor improving 150 bps to 79.6% for carriers in the region.<nl/>International traffic for 
Latin American carriers, which include the likes of GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. GOL[1] and Copa Holdings 
SA CPA[2], for July, was up 8.5% on an 8% rise in capacity. Improvement in trade in the region offset the soft 
economic scenario prevalent in Brazil and Argentina, resulting in improvement in business travel. International July 
traffic for European carriers, such as Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3], climbed 6.7% on a 4% rise in capacity. The 
region witnessed the most packed planes with load factor of 87.3% topping across all regions. Economic recovery 
in the Eurozone boosted demand for carriers in the region. African carriers reported a 4.9% improvement in traffic 
on a 3.9% rise in monthly capacity.<nl/>Robust North American Performance<nl/>Bullish expectations with regard 
to the U.S. economy drove the healthy 5.3% year-over-year rise in July traffic. The rise was more than double the 
growth witnessed in June 2015. Capacity rose 3.5% and another important metric, load factor, climbed 140 basis 
points to 86.5%. In fact, carriers in the North American region are coming off a strong second quarter, aided by low 
fuel costs. Major companies like Delta Air Lines DAL[4], American Airlines Group AAL[5] and United Continental 
Holdings UAL[6] posted better-than-expected earnings in the second quarter of 2015, bolstered by weak fuel prices. 
American Airlines Group, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines Co. LUV[7] and United Continental Holdings together 
raked in a net income of $4.99 billion in the second quarter.<nl/>India, China Lead Domestic Traffic 
Surge<nl/>According to the report, domestic travel demand was also strong in July. Stellar domestic traffic growth 
Strong Global Traffic Data in July, Fall Forecast Disappoints
in India (28.1%) and China (10.9%) boosted domestic passenger traffic by 7.6%. The domestic traffic picture in the 
U.S. also fared better than the broader international space, with the metric reporting 5.9% growth.<nl/>Total 
domestic capacity for the month climbed 6.5% and load factor climbed 80 bps to 83.6% driven by the greater 
increase in traffic. Capacity contracted in Japan during the month even as traffic increased, leading to empty 
planes.<nl/>Fall Forecast Tepid<nl/>The strong traffic numbers for July did not however lead to an encouraging 
projection with respect to air travel for the fall of 2015. According to the IATA, the projection is nothing less than 
'unsettled' as far as the outlook for air travel this fall is considered. The prevalent global worries, led by the China 
turmoil, are certainly not helping matters. The forecast for fall certainly comes as a dampener given that carriers 
have had a really busy summer this year.<nl/>Air Freight Demand Weak<nl/>The IATA revealed that air freight 
volumes slipped 0.6% on a year-over-year basis in July 2015. Air cargo volume is a key indicator of business 
confidence. Weak world trade growth due to global concerns was blamed for the weakness in demand growth for 
air freight.<nl/>However, the outlook of air cargo volumes is rosier for the back end of the year due to bullish 
expectations about world trade that should support economic growth. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks

Lufthansa to cancel long-haul flights amid fresh strike
Lufthansa to cancel long-haul flights amid fresh strike

Sep 07, 2015( Deutsche Welle Germany: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/germany/s-1432 Delivered by Newstex) 
<nl/> Flight crews have begun fresh strikes at Lufthansa, prompting the German airline to cancel 84 long-haul 
flights for Tuesday. The union Cockpit is upset over a planned subsidiary to be based in Austria. 
Germany's classic airline said it would still run 90 intercontinental flights and 7 cargo flights on Tuesday using 
volunteer crews after the union declared the breakdown of talks focused on cost-cutting efforts.<nl/> The strike by 
Cockpit (VC), which represents some 5,000 pilots with Lufthansa and another subsidiary Germanwings, is the 13th 
such work stoppage in the past 18 months. Its last strike was in March, shortly before the Germanwings disaster in 
France.<nl/> Cockpit said short and medium-range flights from Germany would be subjected to strike action on 
Wednesday.<nl/> Airline board member responsible for personnel Bettina Volkens said Lufthansa could only 
apologize to passengers, including families with intended flights home at the end of school vacations in Germany's 
southern states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg.<nl/> Strife centers on new unit Eurowings <nl/> Lufthansa 
managers want to further slash costs by transferring one Germanwings jet per month to a new low-pay unit 
Eurowings. It is incorporated in Austria, where German collective labor deals do not apply. <nl/> Union spokesman 
Markus Wahl said Lufthansa's chief executive Carsten Spohr had refused to delay the relocation of jobs while both 
sides still negotiated. Lufthansa in turn said it had made "far-reaching" offers on Monday.<nl/> Wahl said 
management had rejected union savings suggestions worth about half-a-billion euros. This showed, Wahl said, that 
Lufthansa wanted to break out of existing collective agreements and weaken the union.<nl/> More strikes, with one 
day prior notice, were likely in the coming week to put pressure on the management of Europe's largest airline, he 
said.<nl/> Long-haul flights affected<nl/> The 84 long-haul flights canceled among Tuesday's usual schedule of 
1,500 Lufthansa flights affect passengers traveling from and to Frankfurt, Munich and Düsseldorf.<nl/> Lufthansa 
said it would rebook affected passengers on alternative airlines.<nl/> The 18 months of fractious negotiations have 
centered on Lufthansa's plan to cut entitlements for pilots wanting to retire early and establish a cheaper salary 
structure at Eurowings.<nl/> Union concessions offered include increasing the average retirement age to 60.<nl/> 
"With our offer, we made it clear that the pilots are not against the necessary adjustments," Wahl said. <nl/> 
Standard practice, says Spohr<nl/> Last Friday, Spohr told Reuters that over 1,000 pilots from within the Lufthansa 
group and outside had applied for jobs at Eurowings.<nl/> "To create an airline's operating certificate in another 
country is something the other low-cost carriers do and we copied that model for our low-cost operation, he 
said.<nl/> Lufthansa is facing challenges from budget airlines such as Easyjet and Ryanair and Middle East-
financed operators such as Etihad, which has a stake in another German-based operator, Air Berlin.<nl/> ipj/jr (dpa,

Sep 04, 2015( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> The short-haul airline 
expects profits of up to £700 million for its financial year, which closes at the end of this month.<nl/>
 That is 20 per cent higher than the £581 million booked last year and 6 per cent higher than the outcome that it 
was suggesting less than six weeks ago.<nl/> The Times[1] reports that a new forecast made easyJet's shares 
among the top risers in the FTSE 100 yesterday, up more than 5 per cent at £17.62.<nl/> 'The best route network 
connecting Europe's primary airports . . . meant that easyJet was best placed to maximise the strong late summer 
demand from UK passengers to get away,' said Carolyn McCall, the chief executive.<nl/> That late demand meant 
that easyJet planes have never flown so full, with load factors of 94.4 per cent in August against an average of 91.4 
per cent for the year as a whole.<nl/> The so-called yield management systems of airlines such as easyJet means 
that late bookers may have to pay three times the average fare for the flight. As the aircraft is flying anyway, most of 
that additional revenue falls directly to the bottom line.<nl/><nl/>Several factors contributed to the late 
getaway.<nl/> They include people being put off sun holidays earlier because of the Greek economic crisis and the 
Tunisian terrorist beach attacks; Britons waking up late to how much cheaper European holidays are this year 
because of the strength of sterling over the euro; and for some parts of the country it was the wettest August on 
record.<nl/> Even after expanding to bases around the Continent, easyJet still has 40 per cent of its 68 million 
passengers a year originating in Britain, where it is the biggest airline for both Gatwick and Luton airports.<nl/> The

Sep 04, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Las Vegas, NV-
based Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[1], the parent company of Allegiant Air, reported impressive traffic numbers 
for the month of Aug 2015. Traffic for the total system, which includes scheduled service and fixed fee contract, 
measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) climbed 20.1% on a year-over-year basis to 757.4 
million.<nl/>System capacity, measured in available seat miles (ASMs), climbed 25.6% in the month to 890.3 
million. 
With capacity growth outpacing the rise in traffic, load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) declined 380 basis 
points from Aug 2014 to 85.1%. Allegiant carried 22.6% more passengers in Aug 2015.<nl/>Moreover, according to 
the preliminary financial results released by the company for August, the system-wide average fuel cost per gallon 
was approximately $1.75 per gallon. The company expects system-wide capacity growth for the third quarter of 
2015 in the band of 23% to 25%. The metric is projected to grow in the band of 21% to 26% in the final quarter of 
2015.<nl/>The increase in August traffic brings further positive news for Allegiant Travel which has already been 
witnessing good times courtesy weak oil prices. The positive impact of soft oil prices on the bottom line is evident 
from the fact that the stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters with an 
average beat of 6.62%. Moreover, earnings estimates for this impressive player in the airline space are also on an 
upswing.<nl/>Zacks Rank<nl/>Allegiant Travel Company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other well-

Sep 03, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Delta Air Lines Inc. 
DAL[1] witnessed an increase in air traffic in the month of August wherein traffic - measured in revenue passenger 
miles (RPMs) - stood at 20.8 billion. 
This figure reflects a 3.9% increase from 20.03 billion recorded a year ago.<nl/>On a year-over-year basis, 
consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) inched up 4.2% to 23.8 billion. Meanwhile, the load factor or 
percentage of seats filled by passengers decreased to 87.3% in the month being discussed from 87.6% in the year-
ago month.<nl/>In the first eight months of 2015, Delta generated RPMs of 142.7 billion (up 3.4% year over year) 
and ASMs of 168.1 billion (up 4.2% year over year). Load factor stood at 84.9% compared with 85.5% in Aug 2014. 
Likewise, passengers boarded in the month improved 4.6% while that for the full year rose 4.3%.<nl/>However, 
Delta witnessed a 6.5% drop in PRASM (passenger revenue per available seat mile) in the month mainly affected 
by weaker foreign exchange rates in comparison to a strengthening U.S. dollar. Moreover, lower surcharge rates in 
international markets further affected PRASM growth.<nl/>Delta continues to perform impressively on the back of 
new route launches, ancillary product introductions, revamping of fleet structure and efficient customer service. 
Further, the company continues to deliver solid results through its joint venture and expects trans-Atlantic revenues 
and capacity to increase backed by the strength in the New York-London route.<nl/>Zacks Rank ...ocks to 
Consider<nl/>Delta Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the airline space 
include Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[2], JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU[3] and SkyWest Inc. SKYW[4]. All three

Alaska Air Group (ALK) August Traffic Up 7% Y/Y, Stock Gains

Sep 03, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Shares of Seattle, 
WA-based Alaska Air Group ALK[1] gained 5.39% to reach $78.83 on Sep 2, following the release of impressive 
traffic results for Aug 2015. Traffic - measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) - came in at 3.09 billion on a 
consolidated basis, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 7%.<nl/>Furthermore, consolidated capacity (or 
available seat miles/ASMs) improved 7.7% to 3.57 billion. 
However, another important metric load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) decreased marginally to 
86.7% as the rise in capacity was more than the improvement in traffic.<nl/>At the end of the first eight months of 
2015, Alaska Air Group generated RPMs of 22.41 billion (up 8.4% year over year) and ASMs of 26.35 billion (up 
9.8%). Load factor declined 110 basis points to 85.1%.<nl/>Apart from the rise in August traffic, Alaska Air, like 
many other carriers, has been benefiting from weak oil prices. Despite the recent rally, crude prices have been 
hovering around the $40 a barrel mark. This represents a significant decline from the approximately $105 per barrel 
witnessed in July last year.<nl/>Weak oil prices have helped the carrier report higher-than-expected earnings in 
each of the last four quarters. With oil prices expected to be soft for at least the rest of 2015, Alaska Air Group's 
bottom line should continue to benefit.<nl/>Moreover, earnings estimates for 2015 and 2016 are on an upswing, 
further reflecting good times for the carrier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2015 has climbed 10 cents to $6.29 
over the last 30 days, while the same for 2016 has increased 17 cents to $6.65 per share over the same time 
period.<nl/>Alaska Air Group's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) is further indicative of our bullish stance on the 
stock.<nl/>Other Stocks to Consider<nl/>Investors interested in the airline space may also consider stocks like 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2], China Eastern Airlines Corp. Ltd. CEA[3] and SkyWest SKYW[4]. All the three stocks

Sep 01, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Low-cost carrier 
JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU[1] recently decided to expand its seasonal non-stop flight service between New York's 
John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and Palm Springs International Airport (PSP) in Southern California. 
The service is expected to commence this winter, subject to government approval.<nl/>Under the new extension, 
JetBlue will run flights from Thursday to Monday every week beginning Jan 14, 2016, through May 1, 2016. As a 
promotional offer, ticket fares will start at as low as $99 for a one-way trip. This service will largely serve travelers 
interested in a winter escape.<nl/>The company has decided to fly Airbus A320 on both the routes. These aircraft 
will provide more leg space, free unlimited snacks as well as soft drinks. Moreover, passengers will be able to 
watch unrestricted movies and TV programs on DIRECTV channels and stream music on SIRIUS XM Holdings 
Inc.'s SIRI[2] radio stations. In addition, fliers will be able to access free in-flight Wi-Fi connectivity.<nl/>Coming to 
traffic data, JetBlue recently revealed encouraging numbers for the month of July on the back of increased travel 
demand. Traffic - measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) - stood at 3.99 billion, up 8.9% year over year. 
Likewise, PRASM (passenger revenue per available seat mile) in the month inched up 1% from the last-year 
period.<nl/>Meanwhile, we believe that JetBlue's increased flight frequencies coupled with low fares will enhance 
travel options for New York dwellers during winter months while boosting passenger revenues for the 
company.<nl/>Zacks Rank ...her Key Picks<nl/>JetBlue currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Other

Aug 28, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> On Aug 24, 2015, 
we issued an updated research report on Canadian National Railway Company CNI[1].<nl/>Recently, Canadian 
National reported second-quarter 2015 financial results wherein both the top and the bottom line surpassed the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate aided by higher freight volumes.<nl/>
In view of the strong fundamentals, we believe that the company will be able to achieve its double-digit year-over-
year earnings growth target in 2015. Meanwhile, operating ratio in the reported quarter, stood at 56.4% compared 
with 59.6% in the year-ago quarter. We are impressed by the company's efforts to return more to shareholders 
through dividend payments and share buybacks. Canadian National has a strong balance sheet with solid free cash 
flow, which encourages it to raise dividends and repurchase shares.<nl/>However, uncertainties surrounding the 
coal market have been a major concern for Canadian National, particularly owing to lower pet coke export. Offshore 
coal export is expected to remain a challenge going forward. Lower coal shipments will offset the positive impact of 
other products lines, thus affecting the company's revenues. At the end of the second quarter of 2015, revenues 
from the coal business dropped 26%.<nl/>Canadian National faces significant competition from rail carriers and 
other modes of transportation. It faces rivalry specifically from Canadian Pacific Railway, which operates the other 
major rail systems in Canada and services almost similar areas in which Canadian National serves. It also faces 
intense competition from trucking companies in eastern Canada.<nl/>Canadian National currently has a Zacks 
Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the transportation-related space are Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[2], 
JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU[3] and SkyWest Inc. SKYW[4]. All the three companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong 
Buy).<nl/>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best

Aug 27, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Southwest Airlines 
Co. LUV[1] decided to launch two new non-stop seasonal flights from Memphis to Austin, Texas. Under the new 
extension, the carrier will operate flights only on Saturdays and Sundays starting Dec 5, 2015 through Jan 3, 2016. 
This also marks the inclusion of Austin as the seventh destination in the carrier's network.<nl/>
However, at the closing of the winter holiday season, the flight service will be available only on Saturdays from Jan 
9 through Mar 5, 2016. Launch of non-stop flights during weekends will open up more options to passengers and 
will allow them to skip connecting flights, thereby helping them save travel time.<nl/>Notably, Southwest Airlines' 
weekend flights will create significant competition for Allegiant Air as the latter also plans to initiate Thursday and 
Sunday non-stop flights on the Memphis-Austin route. Allegiant Air's service is slated to begin from Oct 1 this 
year.<nl/>In keeping with its expansion efforts, Southwest Airlines recently announced plans of introducing non-stop 
flights to Orlando International as well, starting Dec 5, 2015. Even in April this year, the carrier flagged off two non-
stop daily flights connecting Memphis and Dallas Love Field.<nl/>Hence, we believe that increased flight 
frequencies coupled with low fares will not only enhance travel options for travelers during busy travel periods but 
will also boost revenues for Southwest Airlines.<nl/>Currently, Southwest Airlinescarries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). 
Other favorably-ranked stocks in the airline space include Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[2], JetBlue Airways Corp. 
JBLU[3] and SkyWest Inc. SKYW[4]. All the three companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).<nl/>Want the

Will Republic Airways File For Bankruptcy? Shares Plunge

Aug 27, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Shares of 
Indianapolis-based Republic Airways Holdings Inc. RJET[1], the parent company of Republic Airlines and Shuttle 
America, plummeted 36.72% to close the trading session on Aug 26 at $2.12. The drastic fall came on the heels of 
a local pilot union's (Teamsters' Local 357) adverse recommendation pertaining to pilots voting on the 'last, best 
and final offer' by the beleaguered company, according to a Bloomberg report. 
<nl/>We remind investors that the company made the above contract offer last week in a bid to resolve the long-
standing labor dispute that has been hurting it big time, resulting in pilot shortage. Republic Airways put forward the 
offer to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 357, for consideration. The body represents 
approximately 2,100 pilots belonging to the company. The Bloomberg report stated that according to the offer put 
forward by the company, new first officers would receive a pay hike to the tune of 74%. Senior pilots would be 
eligible for a smaller raise. Moreover, pilots would also apparently get a ratification bonus in the range of $1,000 to 
$11,000 depending on the duration of service, in addition to a bonus on the completion of one-year of 
ratification.<nl/>The Bloomberg report stated that the adverse recommendation from the local pilot union came due 
to the presence of a clause in the contract that would stand in the way of the union from encouraging its members 
taking up jobs at other regional carriers.<nl/>The adverse stance of the local pilot union is a huge blow to the 
company since it had already stated that in the event of the pilots rejecting the final offer filing for Chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection may be the only option available to it. In such a scenario, the only ray of hope is that the 
national union has powers to overrule the recommendation of the local union and ask the pilots to vote on the 
contract.<nl/>We expect investor focus to remain on updates on the labor problems at Republic Airways. No 
wonder, the company carries a bearish Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) - a true reflection of the troubled times it is currently 
going through.<nl/>Stocks to Consider<nl/>While Republic Airways is clearly a stock that should be dumped now, 
there are other airline stocks which may prove to be prudent additions to an investor's portfolio. Investors may 
consider augmenting their portfolios with Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2], JetBlue Airways Corporation JBLU[3] and 
SkyWest SKYW[4]. All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).<nl/>Want the latest recommendations

Aug 26, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Premium U.S. 
carrier Delta Air Lines DAL[1] and British carrier Virgin Atlantic Airways recently decided to boost the trans-Atlantic 
network with the launch of two new routes. The new extension will connect Salt Lake City and Heathrow, and New 
York's JFK airport to Edinburgh, Scotland routes, starting May, next year.<nl/>
Under this new agreement, Delta will be operating the only non-stop service between Salt Lake City to London 
Heathrow. Notably, Salt Lake City will be the carrier's eighth location from Heathrow.<nl/>On the other hand, the 
non-stop service between New York's JFK and Edinburgh will commence from May 26, 2016, allowing passengers 
in the U.K. up to 60 convenient onward connections from JFK.<nl/>Similarly, Delta's newly-launched flight service 
connecting Scotland's capital city equals Virgin Atlantic's three times weekly summer seasonal service from 
Glasgow to Orlando.<nl/>Flyers of Delta One cabin on both the Salt Lake City to Heathrow and New York-JFK to 
Edinburgh carrier will have access to full flat-bed seats and can enjoy a wide variety of personalized dining options. 
Furthermore, the carrier will offer on-board entertainment options which include Wi-Fi connectivity, on-demand 
movies and TV shows.<nl/>Launch of two new networks will significantly expand flight frequency and also offer 
more options to passengers traveling between the U.S. and the U.K. Moreover, busy holiday seasons heighten 
traffic between these nations which we believe will result in an increased number of flights across the trans-Atlantic 
network, simultaneously driving passenger revenue for the carriers.<nl/>Delta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 
(Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the airline space include Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[2], JetBlue Airways Corp. 
JBLU[3] and SkyWest Inc. SKYW[4]. All the three companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).<nl/>Want the

With many UK couples looking for reliable weather and lower wedding costs, the trend for getting married abroad is 
increasing with an estimated 1.5 million people in the UK travelling abroad in 2014 as a wedding guest or as part of 
the wedding party*. Airport Parking ...tels (APH) is therefore helping 'Fly Away Brides' to plan ahead with a 
comprehensive guide which compares the different airline policies for transporting wedding dresses and cakes 
abroad. The research can be found in the Know Before You Go section of the APH website at            
www.aph.com/weddingdresses.<nl/>
The research compares the guidelines for travelling with a wedding dress and/or cake across 15 major airlines 
including easyJet, Virgin Atlantic and Thomson Airways, and highlights the different policies for carrying dresses as 
hand baggage and hold luggage. The guide also highlights the airline regulations relating to how the dress needs to 
be packed and whether any additional baggage options are available to couples.<nl/>All of the 15 airlines in the 
study were found to allow wedding dresses to be transported as hand luggage although 14 of the airlines offer no 
additional baggage allowance for the bride, meaning the dress must still remain within the individual airlines' 
luggage policy. Meanwhile, couples who have booked a wedding package through Thomas Cook are entitled to 
11kgs hand luggage spread across two bags for each person travelling, instead of the usual policy of 6kgs in one 
bag.<nl/>For those brides happy to transport their wedding dress as part of their checked luggage allowance, most 
of the airlines apply normal checked baggage rules whereas couples who have booked a Thomson Wedding are 
entitled to an extra 5kgs of checked luggage free of charge. For those travellers flying with flybe and opting for a 
traditional Scottish wedding abroad, they must be aware that the kilt pin and sgian gubh (sock knife) can only be 
carried as checked luggage for obvious security reasons.<nl/>When it comes to the all-important packing of the 
wedding dress, airlines such as Air Canada, British Airways, Lufthansa and US Airways recommend that the dress 
is packed in a foldable garment bag to reduce creases and damage during the flight. Whereas, Virgin Atlantic 
require the dress to be packed in a separate suitcase marked 'fragile wedding garments' if it is to travel in the 
hold.<nl/>In terms of special assistance whilst onboard, brides travelling with British Airways and Virgin Atlantic can 
request for their dress to be hung in the wardrobe storage area if space is available. Meanwhile, Ryanair will go one 
step further and allow passengers to book an additional seat for their dress for the duration of the flight. Passengers 
must note that if they require an extra seat for their wedding dress with Ryanair, they must pay the full ticket price 
for the seat occupied.<nl/>Three of the 15 airlines compared in the survey, including Aer Lingus, easyJet and flybe, 
Fly Away Bride: Airport Parking And Hotels (APH) Compares The Cost Of Transporting Wedding Dresses 
Onboard Major Airlines
also allow passengers to bring their wedding cakes onboard. For those travelling with Aer Lingus, there is the option 
of checking the cake in or carrying it as hand luggage whereas with easyJet, wedding cakes can only be carried as 
hand luggage and stored in the overhead locker or under the seat, but not on the passenger's lap. Meanwhile, 
passengers with flybe on an international flight must contact the Department for Environment Food ...ral Affairs 
(Defra) to ensure they are allowed to export their wedding cake.<nl/>For further information on Airport Parking and

American Airlines Group to Stop Philadelphia-Tel Aviv Service

Aug 24, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> According to 
various media reports, Fort Worth, Texas-based American Airlines Group AAL[1], which was formed following the 
Dec 2013 merger between AMR (American Airlines' parent group, founded in 1934) and US Airways, will no longer 
fly to Israel from early January next year. Apparently, lack of profitability led to the decision of terminating the 
carrier's sole direct flight to Israel, which connected Philadelphia and Tel Aviv.<nl/>
The route has been operative for six years now but has unfortunately not been able to deliver profits. . In fact, 
according to the Street, the carrier has lost in excess of $20 million in 2015 due to its operations on the route. 
According to the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), the union representing flight attendants of 
American Airlines and US Airways, the route will be discontinued effective Jan 4, 2016. US Airways was 
responsible for operating flights on the route.<nl/>Flights on the route were apparently packed (operated with high 
load factor). However, the metric is not the sole criterion for judging the financial performance of a route, according 
to the APFA release. The carrier has also reportedly stated that post-termination, passengers already booked on 
the flights will either be offered full refund or provided with alternative arrangements.<nl/>However, according to an 
article appearing in the Times of Israel, the possibility of a political motive behind American Airlines' decision cannot 
be ruled out. The article conjectured whether the move to close down the route was necessitated by American 
Airlines' inclination to strengthen its ties with Arab carriers such as Royal Jordanian and Qatar Airways. American 
Airlines apparently shares flights and other services with its Arab counterparts, being a part of the OneWorld 
alliance of airlines.<nl/>Although American Airlines has decided to omit Israel from its operational itinerary from 
early next year, we note that many other carriers, including Delta Air Lines DAL[2], have operations in 
Israel.<nl/>Zacks Rank<nl/>American Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the airline 
space include Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] and SkyWest Inc. SKYW[4]. Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1

Aug 19, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> On Aug 18, 2015, 
shares of Copa Holdings SA CPA[1] dropped to a 52-week low of $59.61 and eventually closed at $59.95. 
Moreover, year to date, the company's shares have declined a massive 41%.<nl/>Notably, the price decline can be 
largely attributed to adverse foreign currency movements stemming from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar 
against the Brazilian real. 
We believe these factors have not only forced most passengers to defer their travel plans but have also hurt the 
carrier's air traffic and profit numbers.<nl/>Additionally, the 2015 projection by the International Air Transport 
Association (IATA) paints a gloomy picture for Latin American carriers. According to the forecast, these carriers will 
account for only $600 million of the $29.3 billion global net profit projected by IATA.<nl/>Moreover, Copa Airlines, 
the business arm of Copa Holdings, posted a decrease in air traffic for the month of June 2015. Traffic - measured 
in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) - came in at 1.28 billion, down 3.4% from 1.32 billion recorded in the 
comparable month a year ago.<nl/>Further, despite increased flight frequencies and route expansion, load factor of 
Copa Airlines continues to suffer. The load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers in the month fell to 
72% from 77.4% in Jun 2014.<nl/>Adding to the woes, stiff competition from the likes of LATAM Airlines, Azul 
Brazilian Airlines and GOL Linhas - which largely dominate the Brazilian aviation space - may continue to mar 
revenues for Copa Holdings.<nl/>Meanwhile, over the past 60 days, the company has witnessed downward 
estimate revisions for both the current quarter and year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has moved 
down to $1.48 from $1.90 whereas the same for the year has fallen 17.7% to $6.52.<nl/>Copa Holdings currently 
carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).<nl/>Stocks to Consider<nl/>Better-ranked stocks in the same space include China 
Eastern Airlines Corp. Ltd. CEA[2], SkyWest Inc. SKYW[3] and Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[4]. All three stocks 
sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).<nl/>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Aug 17, 2015( ACTmedia News: http://actmedia.eu Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Airports Council International 
ranked Henri Coanda International Airport of Bucharest Europe No. 4 among the airports having recorded the 
highest growth of the air traffic in the first half of 2015, in the group of the airports welcoming between 5 and 10 
million passengers a year. 
The top three airports in this group included Milan-Bergamo, Porto and Glasgow, with Budapest ranking 5th. The 
National Bucharest Airports Company (CNAB) recorded more than 4.217 million passengers and 52,116 flights 
(landings and take-offs) at Bucharest's International Henri Coanda 'Otopeni' Airport and International Bucharest-
Baneasa Aurel Vlaicu Airport in the six months as compared to last Jan.-June, thus setting the prerequisites for 
hitting the 9-million passenger mark this year, CNAB said in a release. According to it, Henri Coanda Airport 
accounted for the bulk of such traffic, with 4,215,314 passengers and 46,426 aircraft movements. The evolution of 
the number of passengers at the two Bucharest international airports significantly outdoes the general European 
trend of 4.5 percent. Aircraft landings and take-offs at Bucharest airports also grew and passed the 2 percent 
European trend. Thus, the number of aircraft movements at the two international airports in the first six months was 
up 8.7 percent from the same period last year. Operating at Henri Coanda International Airport at present are 31 
airlines, which fly passengers to 70 destinations. Two new airlines began operating at Henri Coanda Airport in 
2014, Ryanair and Air Baltic respectively. CNAB began functioning in Feb. 2010 and it provides the operating 
coordination and management of the two Bucharest airports. CNAB was set up by the merger of the companies that 
managed the two Bucharest airports — Henri Coanda and Bucharest-Baneasa respectively.<nl/>

Renault Zoe Review
Renault Zoe Review
Gas 2.0

Aug 17, 2015( Gas 2.0: http://gas2.org/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Originally published on EV Obsession[1].<nl/> 
I finally got to test drive a Renault Zoe[2]. Two years after trying out the Nissan Leaf[3], BMW i3[4], Volkswagen e-
Up![5], Smart Electric Drive[6], and Renault Twizy[7], I got my hands on the popular electric car that barely escaped 
my grasp a few times at EVS27[8] in Barcelona. For the most part, it was better than I expected it would be. 
However, there were some downsides to the vehicle that I wasn't prepared for as well.<nl/>            
http://cleantechnica.com/files/2015/08/Renault-Zoe-1.jpg            http://cleantechnica.com/files/2015/08/Renault-Zoe-
4.jpg<nl/>Renault Zoe Acceleration<nl/>
First of all, let's talk about the big dog — acceleration. Instant torque and the wonderful acceleration that comes 
with it is the first[9] or second[10] biggest consumer advantage of electric cars for most electric car drivers. Like I 
said, it has been a couple of years since I drove all of those electric cars listed above. The biggest thing that caught 
my attention[11] at the time was the wonderful, quick acceleration those vehicles had, and also how smooth and 
quiet that acceleration was. But I was starting to wonder recently if my perception had been warped, or if I was 
flowering it up too much in my memory.<nl/> I recently (in the past two months or so) rented a Mercedes A180, a 
Mercedes C180, and a BMW 320i. They were much nicer than the other gasmobiles I rented in the past year or so, 
so I was starting to wonder if they perhaps compared more favorably to affordable electrics like the Leaf and Zoe. I 
also drove the Tesla P85D[12] a few months ago, which completely messed me up and warped my perception of 
reality and 'what a car is.' Then, about one month ago, I test drove a Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV[13]. Expecting to 
love the acceleration like I had when I first drove the electric cars listed above, I was a little let down, as it wasn't as 
thrilling as before. So I was thinking, 'Is my memory warped? Were those electric cars as nice as I think I 
remember?'<nl/> Indeed, I did remember correctly. Electric drive rocks. I love it, and I can't imagine anyone not 
loving it. Test driving the Renault Zoe, I could quickly tell that it totally kicked the butts of the Mercedes A180, 
Mercedes C180, and BMW 320i… and every other gasmobile I've ever driven. Of course, it didn't compare to the 
Tesla P85D (at a price ~$100,000 lower, how could it?), but it was much better than those three gasmobiles, the 
Toyota Auris Hybrid[14] I recently drove, and also the two plug-in hybrids I've driven — the Outlander PHEV and 
the Audi A3 e-tron (which I test drove about an hour after the Zoe — review coming soon, along with more on the 
difference between 100% electrics and PHEVs).<nl/> Bottom line: The Zoe's acceleration was great. I didn't keep 
my eye on the speedometer, but the high-quality acceleration did taper off at some point, which I think was around 
30 mph. Again, it's no P85D, but it's often just that first 30 mph or so where quick acceleration comes in handy. We 
don't typically drive on 0-60 mph race tracks.<nl/>Interior<nl/>One thing that impressed me was the great visibility, 
particularly in the front. I'm not sure how you're supposed to phrase this and talk about the specifics of such 
Renault Zoe Review
matters, but the bottom line is that there was a lot of glass and I could see around the car really well, which I (and 
many others) hugely appreciate. It makes driving much less stressful… and much safer.<nl/> Both in the front and 
the back, you feel like you are sitting up quite higher, somewhat like in a crossover/CUV. The Renault sales guy 
pointed out that the battery sits underneath the seats, and thus bumps the humans inside up a bit.<nl/> Overall, that 
left for quite a lot of space, yet another thing I was impressed with. There was a lot of space the in front, what 
looked like a ton of space in the trunk, and more space in the back seat than I would have expected. At about 6'1″, I 
was able to sit in the back seat comfortably, with extra room (not at all like on my Ryanair flight to the UK). It doesn't 
look that way in the pictures, but I'll share them anyway:<nl/> http://cleantechnica.com/files/2015/08/Renault-Zoe-

http://cleantechnica.com/files/2015/08/Renault-Zoe-3.jpg<nl/><nl/> <nl/>One place where Renault clearly cut some 
costs was in the interior materials. They are not what you'd find in a $50,000 car, but this certainly isn't a $50,000 
car. The starting price is £13,445 (~$21,000). But I'll get to pricing matters in a minute.<nl/> The steering wheel was 
not my favorite — it wasn't like the thick ones I had in the Mercedes A180, Mercedes C180, BMW 320i, or Tesla 
Model S — but it was quite okay. Certainly good enough, I'd say.<nl/> The Zoe also had a backup camera, much 
like the one in the Nissan Leaf or BMW i3. I don't care for many of the extras they throw in many higher-end cars 
these days, but I like me a good backup camera, so it was nice to see that in this super affordable car.<nl/> One 
more thing I found to be a really nice surprise was the comfort of the seat. I don't know if my body was built weird, if 
my body design simply doesn't match many driving seats, or what, but my lower back often gets very tired after 
driving for a bit. My back was quite tired from activities I was doing in the morning that put a lot of strain on it, and I 
was very pleasantly surprised out how comfy the seat was. For my body, it was clearly better than the Mercedes 
A180 I had rented as well as the slightly better Audi A3 e-tron's seat. That's a really important factor for me, so it 
just made me love the Zoe that much more.<nl/>            http://cleantechnica.com/files/2015/08/Renault-Zoe-
5.jpg<nl/>Price<nl/>The sales guy I talked with noted that about 99% of customers got a lease (or what they call a 
PCP) rather the purchasing the car. Renault knocked £5,000 off the starting price with that option (but not with 
the purchase option). After the £5,000 UK EV grant, that brought the ~£20,000 model I was looking at down to 
~£10,000 — based on mileage figures I pulled out of the air.<nl/> The thing is, you lease the battery as well, and 
the price of that depends on how many miles you intend to drive. (Go over your mileage, on average across the 
term of your lease, and you end up paying much more per mile — just like what happens if you use your phone 
beyond the minutes in your monthly phone plan.) Of course, the monthly payments are also lower if you put more 
money down up front, but either way, the total I came to was a bit less than £10,000 (+ ~£70-90 a month for the 
battery) after the UK and Renault incentives. The car sells pretty well in the UK[15]. I doesn't match the Leaf, 
however.<nl/>Customer Service<nl/>Aside from the car, I was curious how well the salesman would sell the car. He 
said almost right off the bat that he wasn't super knowledgeable about the car, and that I probably knew more since 
I was an electric car fan (I told him that off the bat too). However, I found that he knew quite a lot, and certainly 
more than me about the three Zoe trims they sell. He seemed to know the answer of every question I had.<nl/> He 
was proactive when showing me the car too, had a positive attitude about it, and didn't try to steer me elsewhere. 
He didn't come across as an EV fanatic, unfortunately, but he maintained a positive attitude about the car and its 
competitiveness throughout. I found out from him that the Zoe actually sells quite well there. This small salon moves 
about 8-9 of them out each month. It would have been cool if he was really into the technology, but as things go, he 
was more positive and knowledgable than I expected, so that's a + for Renault.<nl/>Aesthetics<nl/>Visual taste is, 
of course, a highly subjective matter — despite many people talking about how 'beautiful' or 'ugly' cars are as if it's 
a matter of fact. Personally, I love how the Zoe looks. The sales guy and I talked a bit, via my prompting, about 
what made buyers choose a Zoe over a Leaf, and it turned out the look was a big reason. I actually like the look of 
the Leaf quite a bit, but I do prefer the Zoe.<nl/>Zoe vs Leaf?<nl/>Other benefits over the Leaf, by the way, 
were reportedly a bit more range in real-world driving, and that the Zoe came with a single charging cable that 
provided various charging options whereas you'd have to get an extra charging cable for the Leaf to have the same 
capability.<nl/> I'd have to check out a Leaf again, and see pricing in the UK, to make a decision between these two 
vehicle. At the moment, though, I'm actually leaning toward the Zoe.<nl/><nl/><nl/><nl/> Tags: Renault[16], Renault

published on EV Obsession[3].<nl/> I finally got to test drive a Renault Zoe[4]. Two years after trying out the Nissan 
Leaf[5], BMW i3[6], Volkswagen e-Up![7], Smart Electric Drive[8], and Renault Twizy[9], I got my hands on the 
popular electric car that barely escaped my grasp a few times at EVS27[10] in Barcelona. For the most part, it was 
better than I expected it would be. However, there were some downsides to the vehicle that I wasn't prepared for as 
well.<nl/>            http://c1cleantechnicacom.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2015/08/Renault-Zoe-1.jpg

Zoe 
Acceleration<nl/>
First of all, let's talk about the big dog — acceleration. Instant torque and the wonderful acceleration that comes 
with it is the first[11] or second[12] biggest consumer advantage of electric cars for most electric car drivers. Like I 
said, it has been a couple of years since I drove all of those electric cars listed above. The biggest thing that caught 
my attention[13] at the time was the wonderful, quick acceleration those vehicles had, and also how smooth and 
quiet that acceleration was. But I was starting to wonder recently if my perception had been warped, or if I was 
flowering it up too much in my memory.<nl/> I recently (in the past two months or so) rented a Mercedes A180, a 
Mercedes C180, and a BMW 320i. They were much nicer than the other gasmobiles I rented in the past year or so, 
so I was starting to wonder if they perhaps compared more favorably to affordable electrics like the Leaf and Zoe. I 
also drove the Tesla P85D[14] a few months ago, which completely messed me up and warped my perception of 
reality and 'what a car is.' Then, about one month ago, I test drove a Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV[15]. Expecting to 
love the acceleration like I had when I first drove the electric cars listed above, I was a little let down, as it wasn't as 
thrilling as before. So I was thinking, 'Is my memory warped? Were those electric cars as nice as I think I 
remember?'<nl/> Indeed, I did remember correctly. Electric drive rocks. I love it, and I can't imagine anyone not 
loving it. Test driving the Renault Zoe, I could quickly tell that it totally kicked the butts of the Mercedes A180, 
Mercedes C180, and BMW 320i… and every other gasmobile I've ever driven. Of course, it didn't compare to the 
Tesla P85D (at a price ~$100,000 lower, how could it?), but it was much better than those three gasmobiles, the 
Toyota Auris Hybrid[16] I recently drove, and also the two plug-in hybrids I've driven — the Outlander PHEV and 
the Audi A3 e-tron (which I test drove about an hour after the Zoe — review coming soon, along with more on the 
difference between 100% electrics and PHEVs).<nl/> Bottom line: The Zoe's acceleration was great. I didn't keep 
my eye on the speedometer, but the high-quality acceleration did taper off at some point, which I think was around 
30 mph. Again, it's no P85D, but it's often just that first 30 mph or so where quick acceleration comes in handy. We 
Renault Zoe Test Drive Review (Exclusive)
don't typically drive on 0-60 mph race tracks.<nl/>Interior<nl/>One thing that impressed me was the great visibility, 
particularly in the front. I'm not sure how you're supposed to phrase this and talk about the specifics of such 
matters, but the bottom line is that there was a lot of glass and I could see around the car really well, which I (and 
many others) hugely appreciate. It makes driving much less stressful… and much safer.<nl/> Both in the front and 
the back, you feel like you are sitting up quite higher, somewhat like in a crossover/CUV. The Renault sales guy 
pointed out that the battery sits underneath the seats, and thus bumps the humans inside up a bit.<nl/> Overall, that 
left for quite a lot of space, yet another thing I was impressed with. There was a lot of space the in front, what 
looked like a ton of space in the trunk, and more space in the back seat than I would have expected. At about 6'1″, I 
was able to sit in the back seat comfortably, with extra room (not at all like on my Ryanair flight to the UK). It doesn't 
look that way in the pictures, but I'll share them anyway:<nl/> http://c1cleantechnicacom.wpengine.netdna-

http://c1cleantechnicacom.wpengine.netdna-
cdn.com/files/2015/08/Renault-Zoe-3.jpg<nl/><nl/> <nl/>One place where Renault clearly cut some costs was in the 
interior materials. They are not what you'd find in a $50,000 car, but this certainly isn't a $50,000 car. The starting 
price is £13,445 (~$21,000). But I'll get to pricing matters in a minute.<nl/> The steering wheel was not my favorite 
— it wasn't like the thick ones I had in the Mercedes A180, Mercedes C180, BMW 320i, or Tesla Model S — but it 
was quite okay. Certainly good enough, I'd say.<nl/> The Zoe also had a backup camera, much like the one in the 
Nissan Leaf or BMW i3. I don't care for many of the extras they throw in many higher-end cars these days, but I like 
me a good backup camera, so it was nice to see that in this super affordable car.<nl/> One more thing I found to be 
a really nice surprise was the comfort of the seat. I don't know if my body was built weird, if my body design simply 
doesn't match many driving seats, or what, but my lower back often gets very tired after driving for a bit. My back 
was quite tired from activities I was doing in the morning that put a lot of strain on it, and I was very pleasantly 
surprised out how comfy the seat was. For my body, it was clearly better than the Mercedes A180 I had rented as 
well as the slightly better Audi A3 e-tron's seat. That's a really important factor for me, so it just made me love the 
Zoe that much more.<nl/>            http://c1cleantechnicacom.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2015/08/Renault-Zoe-
5.jpg<nl/>Price<nl/>The sales guy I talked with noted that about 99% of customers got a lease (or what they call a 
PCP) rather the purchasing the car. Renault knocked £5,000 off the starting price with that option (but not with 
the purchase option). After the £5,000 UK EV grant, that brought the ~£20,000 model I was looking at down to 
~£10,000 — based on mileage figures I pulled out of the air.<nl/> The thing is, you lease the battery as well, and 
the price of that depends on how many miles you intend to drive. (Go over your mileage, on average across the 
term of your lease, and you end up paying much more per mile — just like what happens if you use your phone 
beyond the minutes in your monthly phone plan.) Of course, the monthly payments are also lower if you put more 
money down up front, but either way, the total I came to was a bit less than £10,000 (+ ~£70-90 a month for the 
battery) after the UK and Renault incentives. The car sells pretty well in the UK[17]. I doesn't match the Leaf, 
however.<nl/>Customer Service<nl/>Aside from the car, I was curious how well the salesman would sell the car. He 
said almost right off the bat that he wasn't super knowledgeable about the car, and that I probably knew more since 
I was an electric car fan (I told him that off the bat too). However, I found that he knew quite a lot, and certainly 
more than me about the three Zoe trims they sell. He seemed to know the answer of every question I had.<nl/> He 
was proactive when showing me the car too, had a positive attitude about it, and didn't try to steer me elsewhere. 
He didn't come across as an EV fanatic, unfortunately, but he maintained a positive attitude about the car and its 
competitiveness throughout. I found out from him that the Zoe actually sells quite well there. This small salon moves 
about 8-9 of them out each month. It would have been cool if he was really into the technology, but as things go, he 
was more positive and knowledgable than I expected, so that's a + for Renault.<nl/>Aesthetics<nl/>Visual taste is, 
of course, a highly subjective matter — despite many people talking about how 'beautiful' or 'ugly' cars are as if it's 
a matter of fact. Personally, I love how the Zoe looks. The sales guy and I talked a bit, via my prompting, about 
what made buyers choose a Zoe over a Leaf, and it turned out the look was a big reason. I actually like the look of 
the Leaf quite a bit, but I do prefer the Zoe.<nl/>Zoe vs Leaf?<nl/>Other benefits over the Leaf, by the way, 
were reportedly a bit more range in real-world driving, and that the Zoe came with a single charging cable that 
provided various charging options whereas you'd have to get an extra charging cable for the Leaf to have the same 
capability.<nl/> I'd have to check out a Leaf again, and see pricing in the UK, to make a decision between these two 
vehicle. At the moment, though, I'm actually leaning toward the Zoe. Keep up to date with all the hottest cleantech

Aug 12, 2015( Shanghaiist: http://www.gothamist.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> A total of 30 passengers were 
injured when a Hainan Airlines flight began violently shaking as it was descending in Beijing yesterday afternoon. 
<nl/><nl/>Passengers onboard flight HU7148, which took off from Chengdu, Sichuan province, said people were 
thrown from their seats and described the experience as "terrifying".<nl/><nl/>Fortunately, the plane landed 
safely[1] at the Beijing Capital International at 2:17 p.m. Of the 30 people injured, 23 were sent to the hospital while 
seven of them suffered only minor wounds that didn't require medical attention. <nl/><nl/>One of the passengers, 
surnamed Lin, said many of the passengers were not wearing seat belts at the time. <nl/><nl/>"We heard two 
alarms at around 2:00 p.m. which were immediately followed by weightlessness. I didn't buckle up, so I was directly 
thrown to the ceiling and landed on the row behind us," Lin said.<nl/><nl/>'During the flight, I experienced the 
strongest shaking I have ever had on an airplane,' another passenger[2] wrote online.<nl/><nl/>'Seeing people 
behind me having their heads knocked [against the ceiling of the plane] and being covered in blood, hearing the air 
stewardess speak through a microphone in sobs, I was truly scared.'<nl/><nl/><nl/>One person onboard the flight 
posted an image of an overhead panel that was left dangling in the air after being damaged in the turbulence. 
<nl/><nl/>A representative with Hainan Airlines said[3] cabin crew had no pre warning about the rough air, likely 
contributing to the shock of the experience.<nl/><nl/><nl/>"Around 25 minutes before arrival in Beijing, the aircraft 
suddenly encountered clear air turbulence at the aircraft was descending to 42-hundred meters. Medium air 
turbulence lasted for one to two seconds, and then strong turbulence followed for two seconds. There was no sign 
of any turbulence in advance," the airliner said.<nl/><nl/>And that, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary[4], is why they put 
seat belts on planes.<nl/> [ 1]: http://china.org.cn/china/2015-08/12/content_36283869.htm [ 2]:

Aug 12, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Las Vegas-based 
Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[1], the parent company of Allegiant Air, announced the addition of multiple new 
routes, in a bid to expand further. In what can be deemed a customer-friendly move, the carrier has kept one-way 
fares as low as $49 for all the new routes and destinations.<nl/>
The expansion will allow travelers to fly to their favorite vacation spots at affordable costs. The carrier stated in its 
press release that fliers must purchase tickets by Aug 14, 2015 to avail the low-priced introductory offer for travel 
within Feb 16, 2016.<nl/>As part of the expansion drive, the carrier has decided to operate nonstop flights on as 
many as 17 new routes, including two new cities, San Antonio and Kansas City. The move naturally found favor 
with investors. Consequently, the stock was up 2.25% to $226.99 on Aug 11.<nl/>As per plans, the carrier will start 
operating nonstop flights connecting Oklahoma City and Las Vegas from Nov 5, 2015. Nonstop flights (twice a 
week) on three routes to Tampa Bay will also see the light of day from November. These new flights will connect 
the St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport in Florida to Appleton, WI (Nov 6); Scranton, PA (Nov 6) and Kansas 
City, MO (Nov 12). Furthermore, the carrier stated that it will fly nonstop, twice a week, connecting the Fort 
Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport and San Antonio from Nov 5.<nl/>The expansion drive comes close on 
the heels of the carrier's impressive second-quarter 2015 results. The company reported earnings per share of 
$3.18 which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.13. Quarterly revenues increased 10.9% year over 
year to $322 million, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.<nl/>Zacks Rank<nl/>Allegiant Travel Company 
currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other well-ranked stocks in the transportation sector include Ryanair 
Holdings RYAAY[2], China Eastern Airlines Corp. Ltd. CEA[3] and SkyWest Inc. SKYW[4]. All the three stocks carry

Aug 10, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Global markets looked 
for a strong open on Monday. Why? Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer made a provocative statement to open the 
trading week. 
He commented-- global disinflation "is a factor that bothers us. It is not inevitable, it is not baked in the economies 
abroad, but it is there right now." In light of that, will the Fed hold off on raising rates a bit longer?  Last Friday, 
Zacks consensus poll was evenly split between Sept and Dec rate hikes. This week's key global indicators update 
us on the long-term Eurozone outlook. Is Europe still trapped in weak growth, or has European QE caused a boost? 
On Monday, the Eurozone Sentix indicator came out at 18.5, in line with its prior reading. On Tuesday, Germany's 
ZEQ survey will show financial professionals' optimism. It is likely to be around its long-term average. This is 
consistent with only moderate growth. On Wednesday, Eurozone industrial production could show output rose to a 
+1.7% y/y rate in June. Again, unchanged. On Friday, overall Eurozone Q2 output is likely to be unchanged too. 
The preliminary GDP growth data is projected to show +0.4% in quarterly growth. Q4-14 and Q1-15 recorded the 
same +0.4% GDP growth rate.  In other words, consensus doesn't think Europe's economy has budged. If any 
European macro data surprise this week, that would lift global stocks. Are you a bull and looking for a growth stock 
in Europe? Take a look at Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) Ryanair Holdings (ticker RYAAY[1]). This Irish budget airline 
is in the sweet spot. Air transport benefits from lower oil prices, and the greater spending power of Europe's air 
vacationers. The bullish theme of a strong discretionary spender and weakening oil prices is not limited to the U.S. 
and Europe! In Asia, there are two more strong airline stocks to look into. Two current Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) 
stocks I like are China Eastern Airlines (ticker CEA[2]) and Cathay Pacific Air (ticker CPCAY[3]).  Follow me on 
Twitter @johnblank100 to get my weekly comments on the Global Economy and Global Stocks. Here is the Global 
Week Ahead-- On Monday,in Japan, consumer confidence came in at 40.3, below the prior 41.7 reading. The more

 The Irish no-frills airline claims to be the first ever to carry more than 10 million passengers in a month. <nl/> Kenny

million in July) than Aer Lingus carried in a whole year (9.77 million in 2014)."<nl/> The company reported in 
April reported its full-year results [1]in May, which revealed a 12% jump in revenue to €5.65 billion (£3.95 billion) 
and a 66% rise in profit after tax to €867 million (£605 million), helped along by a plan to improve its customer

Lisbon Joins Europe's Capitals of Cool

Portugal's capital may be packed with history, but it is also full of options for the travel trendsetter. With its vibrant 
nightlife, hip art spaces, quirky shopping and contemporary dining scene, Lisbon is a rising star among Europe's 
coolest cities.<nl/>Below are 10 travel ideas that affect the new face of Lisbon:<nl/>1. Savour gourmet canapés by 
the Portuguese Heston Blumenthal: A star chef in his home country, Michelin-starred José Avillez is Portugal's 
answer to Heston Blumenthal and Ferran Adrià. Mini Bar (           www.minibar.pt) is his latest opening, a casual bar 
with a retro décor, serving experimental yet affordable canapés and gourmet small plates for less than €5 per 
dish.<nl/>2. Hang out at Lisbon's coolest market: The Mercado de Campo de Ourique (           
www.mercadodecampodeourique.pt) has been the heart of the neighbourhood for more than 80 years - but after its 
recent renovation, you will find the traditional vegetable stalls next to gourmet food stands, fresh juice counters and 
bars serving all types of Portuguese wine.<nl/>
3. Party at the 'Pink Street': Until its recent makeover, riverside Cais do Sodré was one of the city's seediest 
neighbourhoods - but today Rua Nova do Carvalho is Lisbon's liveliest street for nightlife, packed with live music 
venues, burlesque clubs and tapas bars. Closed to the traffic, the street is painted with a cheerful bright pink colour, 
giving it its nickname 'Pink Street'.<nl/>4. Buy the perfect souvenir, quirky and 100% Portuguese:Located at the 
much-loved Terreiro do Paço, the Lisbon Shop (https://pt-br.facebook.com/LisbonShop) is the ideal place to buy 
that special gift and take with you a little part of Lisbon - from colourful tiles to urban design, quirky books to 
handmade jewellery, contemporary crafts to recycled materials.<nl/>5. See the likes of Picasso, Dalí, Bacon and 
Warhol for free:There is no entrance fee to visit Museu Colecção Berardo (           http://en.museuberardo.pt/). Its 
wide collection focuses on the major European and American art movements of the 20th and early 21st century, 
covering from surrealism, pop art and hyper-realism to minimalist and conceptual arts.<nl/>6. Take in the latest 
street art exhibition: Lisbon is one of the few capitals in the world to have a government division that encourages, 
promotes and funds street art. There is an 'official' exhibition wall by Galeria de Arte Urbana (           
www.facebook.com/galeriadearteurbana) in Bairro Alto, but you can see street art even on waste collection trucks 
and bottle banks!<nl/>7. Be wowed by one of the best fashion and design collections in Europe: The stark exhibition 
rooms of MUDE (           www.mude.pt), formerly a bank, make its exhibits really pop. Featuring iconic works from 
the design and fashion's world greatest from 1937 to present, this is where Phillipe Starck and Charles Eames 
come together with Jean Paul Gaultier and Vivienne Westwood.<nl/>8. Dine alfresco at Lisbon's latest hotspot: U 
Chiado Trendy Bar ...staurant (           http://uchiado.pt) offers all things to all people and at all hours, both indoors 
and outdoors, from snacks to sushi, weekend brunches to exotic cocktails. Industrial chic is the theme here - and if 
Lisbon Joins Europe's Capitals of Cool
you prefer a late dinner alfresco, the cosy terrace comes with warm blankets available.<nl/>9. Pay a late night visit 
to the impressive Museu do Oriente:The riverfront Museu do Oriente (           www.museudooriente.pt) is so 
superbly converted that few would guess that until a few years ago it was a salt cod warehouse! Open until late 
every Friday, it brings to the forefront the history of Portugal in the Far East during the Age of Discovery.<nl/>10. 
Head to bohemian Bairro Alto for all things vintage and alternative: Once one of the city's least desirable areas, 
today the backstreets of Bairro Alto are crammed with alternative shops, hip hairdressers and fashionable bars. 
Vintage rules in this sassy bohemian enclave, where you can pick up outrageous hand-me-down attires and heaps 
of odd accessories.<nl/>Direct flights to Lisbon operate from London, Manchester, Liverpool, Edinburgh and Bristol 
with TAP Portugal, British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair.<nl/>For more information visiting Lisbon please go to

nightlife of any major European city alongside its dramatic location sprawled along seven hills overlooking the river 
Tagus and the country's west coast. Famed for its year-round sunshine and beauty, Lisbon's grand architecture 
dazzles and its old-world charm mingles with chic streets, galleries, lively nightlife and a centre which gives way to

International of Washington Inc.'s EXPD[1] second-quarter 2015 earnings of 61 cents per share beat the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate by 8 cents. Earnings improved 33% on a year-over-year basis.<nl/>//           
www.findthebest.com/w/fAz5DXtDVMF[2] Expeditors International of Washington Inc. 
- Earnings Surprise | FindTheBest[3] Total revenue of $1.69 billion fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 
$1.74 billion. Revenues climbed 6% from the year-ago figure. Strong air freight and ocean freight revenues 
facilitated the year-over-year top-line improvement in the second quarter.<nl/>Gross profit (net revenue) increased 
14% year over year in the second quarter to $552.1 million. Gross margin (yield) improved to 32.6% in the reported 
quarter. Expeditors exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $985.7 million as compared with 
$927.1 million at the end of 2014.<nl/>Segmental Revenues<nl/>Airfreight Services revenues improved 4% year 
over year to $693.8 million in the second quarter. Ocean Freight and Ocean Services revenues increased 7.5% 
year over year to $576.8 million. Customs Brokerage and Other Services revenues rose 6.5% to approximately 
$421 million.<nl/>Our Take<nl/>We are pleased by Expeditors' earnings outperformance in second-quarter 2015, 
which marks the fourth successive earnings beat at the company. We believe continued strength in the airfreight 
business, led by growing trade between the U.S. and China, places the company favorably in the freight forwarding 
and customer brokerage business. Furthermore, the company's growing supply chain and cost-control measures 
should support revenue and margin expansion, going forward.<nl/>Zacks Rank<nl/>Currently, Expeditors has a 
Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the transportation sector include China Eastern Airlines CEA[4], 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5] and Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[6]. All the three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1

Aug 04, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Following the furor 
surrounding the killing of the lion Cecil at Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park, Georgia-based Delta Air Lines 
DAL[1], which has operations in Africa, issued a statement banning shipments of trophy kills on its 
aircraft.<nl/>Cecil, who was part of a 13-year Oxford University study, was hunted down last month by a Minnesota-
based dentist, Walter Palmer, along with a group of hunters including local guide Theo Bronkhorst, using bows and 
arrows. 
The dentist was on a vacation in Zimbabwe and, according to a report appearing in Fortune, paid a fee of $50,000 
for the trophy hunting.<nl/>The killing of the much-loved 13-year old African lion has sparked an outrage across the 
globe. The incident is being investigated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, according to a report appearing in 
Bloomberg.<nl/>Following the killing, animal rights groups are demanding a ban on trophy hunting. Moreover, the 
African nation has requested for the extradition of the dentist, whose gross act has invited criticism from all 
quarters. Moreover, according to the Bloomberg report, wildlife authorities in Zimbabwe have pulled the strings on 
hunting of lions, leopards and elephants in select areas near the Hwange National Park - Zimbabwe's biggest 
animal sanctuary. Rumors surfaced that another lion, Jericho (possibly Cecil's brother), has also been killed by 
poachers. However, the rumors have thankfully been put to rest with the reports proven to be false.<nl/>In this 
backdrop, Delta has taken strict measures to ban transportation of trophies of lions, leopards, elephants, rhinoceros 
and buffalos as cargo on its planes. Even though the carrier has not mentioned the Cecil incident as a reason 
behind its decision, the move will surely find favor with animal protection groups. A message posted on the airline's 
website stated, 'Prior to this ban, Delta's strict acceptance policy called for absolute compliance with all government 
regulations regarding protected species. Delta will also review acceptance policies of other hunting trophies with 
appropriate government agencies and other organizations supporting legal shipments."<nl/>Delta is the latest 
airline to announce a ban on shipment of hunting trophies. Many foreign carriers have earlier announced similar 
bans. We expect investors to stay tuned on further updates from the airline space pertaining to this sensitive 
issue.<nl/>Zacks Rank<nl/>Delta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the airline space 
include China Eastern Airlines CEA[2], Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] and Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[4]. All the 
three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).<nl/>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment

monthly Queen Mary Journal of Intellectual Property summary of events [5]coming up in that lovely month. Talking 
of events, the next JIPLP-GRUR London seminar, on IP Enforcement in the wake of the IP Enforcement Directive,, 
is coming up on 8 September: more than 60 people have now registered, but there's still room for more. Details of 
this seminar, which is free and has this Kat in the chair, can be accessed here[6].http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-

for

medical use, coming to a Bosphorus near you. The mysteries of the patentability of a substance that already has 
one known medical use, one a further medical use is found for it, have been recently addressed in numerous 
Katposts on the litigation in England and Wales between Warner-Lambert and Actavis, most recently here [7]and 
here[8]. This Kat thanks his friends at the Turkish IP practice of Deri  for the information that Turkish practice, 
following that of the European Patent Convention, indicates that patents are available there for second medical use. 
Thanks go to Okan Can for sending him this link[9] to the piece he wrote together with his colleagues.

the

post[10] on the 1709 Blog about a US copyright infringement action involving fabric designs (clothing designs per se 
are unprotected by copyright law on the basis that they are "useful articles"). There's also a CopyKat post [11]from 
Ben Challis with a round-up that includes the latest on the sad saga of copyright in that eternal dirge "Happy 
Birthday to You". The jiplp weblog features a note [12]by Indranath Gupta and Vishwas H. Devaiah on the Court of 
Justice of the European Union ruling in Ryanair v PR Aviation, on whether the"you can't contract out" provisions of 
the Database Directive apply to data that isn't protected as well as to data which is. PatLit carries a helpful account 
Friday fantasies

jurisdiction that is determined not to be marginal in innovation terms, whatever it feels about the new European

Originally published at ValueWalk[1].<nl/><nl/>Causeway International Value Fund performance review for 
the month ended June 30, 2015.<nl/>Causeway International Value Fund: Commentary<nl/>Concerns of US 
monetary tightening, weakening global growth, and the Greek debt crisis pressured global equity markets in the 
month of June. All but one developed market, Ireland, delivered negative returns in the period. Other top performing 
markets in the developed world included Belgium, Israel, Singapore, and Japan. The biggest laggards in our 
investable universe included New Zealand, Australia, South Korea, Switzerland, and Norway. The best performing 
sectors in the MSCI EAFE Index ('Index') were telecommunication services, financials, health care, consumer 
Staples, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLS[2]), and consumer discretionary. The worst performing sectors in the Index were 
utilities, materials, energy, information technology, and industrials. Every major currency except the Canadian dollar 
appreciated versus the US dollar during the period, thus improving overall returns on overseas assets for US dollar-
based investors.<nl/>            http://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Causeway-International-Value-
Fund-1.jpg<nl/>Causeway International Value Fund: Performance review<nl/>
The Fund modestly underperformed the Index during the month. Fund holdings in the automobiles ...mponents, 
food beverage ...bacco, consumer durables ...parel, utilities, and insurance industry groups detracted from relative 
performance versus the Index in June. Fund holdings in the consumer services, materials, and commercial 
...ofessional services industry groups, as well as an overweight position in the telecommunication services industry 
group and an underweight position in the real estate industry group, offset some of this relative underperformance. 
The largest single detractor from performance was automaker, Hyundai Motor Co (KRX:005380[3]) Co., Ltd. (South 
Korea). Other notable detractors included baked goods food producer, Aryzta AG (Switzerland), energy 
management firm, Schneider Electric SE (France), paints ...atings producer, Akzo Nobel NV (Netherlands), and 
pharmaceutical ...nsumer healthcare company, GlaxoSmithKline Plc (United Kingdom). The largest individual 
positive contributor to return was telecommunication services provider, KDDI Corp. (Japan). Additional top 
contributors during the period included cruise ship operator, Carnival (United Kingdom), financial services provider, 
Credit Suisse Group AG (ADR) (NYSE:CS[4]) (Switzerland), low-budget airline, Ryanair Holdings plc 
(ADR) (NASDAQ:RYAAY[5]) (LON:RYA[6]) Holdings Plc (Ireland), and low-voltage electronics manufacturer, 
Legrand

(France).<nl/>

Jul 12, 2015( Phil's Stock World: http://www.philstockworld.com Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Courtesy of 
ZeroHedge[1]. View original post here[2].<nl/> Submitted by Tyler Durden.<nl/> In the first sellside reaction to the 
latest Greek tragicomedy, moments ago Citi's Richard Cochinos, in a note titled '72 hours for Greece' said what our 
readers have already known for about 6 hours: namely that 'Greece will have 72 hours to implement the changes' 
and goes straight to the bottom line: 'If they are unable to get the package through parliament, then this ends the 
dialogue and the government collapses.<nl/>
 He adds that 'the issue that Greece faces is it might not be possible - cracks in Syriza appeared already over the 
proposal sent to Brussels, what is coming back is even more stringent than the rejected referendum. There is a 
decent chance the Greek government will reshuffle next week, possibly fold on reforms. Domestically they can't 
afford 3-4 weeks for new elections. The Economic Minister has suggested capital controls will remain in place for 
the next two-months (though they may be lightened). During the tourist season this is proving to be a death touch to 
the economy. RyanAir announced last week it is discounting flights to Greece by 30% due to low volumes.'<nl/> We 
had a more directed view: in light of his 'mental waterboarding', Tsipras who has already lost all his credibility with 
both his people and the Troika, should do the only possible thing he can at this point: preserve some integrity with 
his voters, and resign… <nl/> Following the 'mental waterboarding' Tsipras should resign right now 
https://t.co/bhGJaPFiTj[3]<nl/> — zerohedge (@zerohedge) July 12, 2015[4]<nl/><nl/> <nl/> … knowing full well 
that it is very likely that Syriza would be re-elected in the next elections, but meanwhile throwing the ball in Europe's 
court for the final time, forcing the Eurozone to make the Grexit decision instead of, as Merkel has done passive-
aggressively, letting Greece to pick its own poison. Also, in doing so, the blame for the collapse of the Eurozone 
would fall on Germany, something Merkel's ego would hardly be able to withstand. ;<nl/> And as if reading the 
collective's mind, Tsipras did already begin the governmental reshuffling, only instead of quitting he has started the 
purge of the hard-core leftwingers still defending the anti-bailout platform, who are certain to make life a living hell 
for the premier once he returns to Athens from Brussels and has to explain his actions to both his party and to the 
population.<nl/> As Reuters reports, the first targets of Tsipras purge of 'party rebels opposed to an austerity 
package that will have to go through parliament within days' include the most prominent rebels, Energy Minister 
Panagiotis Lafazanis, leader of the so-called 'Left Platform' within Syriza and Deputy Labour Minister Dimitris 
Stratoulis, a former unionist and a fierce opponent of pension cuts. <nl/> Under a Syriza party agreement, deputies 
are supposed to resign their seats if they publicly disagree with government policy although there is nothing to stop 
them refusing to stand down and holding on to their seats as independents.<nl/> Terence Quick, a member of the 
The Purge Begins: Tsipras To Expel Hard Core Left Wingers, Including Energy And Deputy Labor Ministers
rightwing Independent Greeks, the junior coalition partner in the government, said that any deputies who voted 
against the government should resign.<nl/> 'I don't think abstaining or being absent shows you are responsible or 
honorable in these particular circumstances. You either go in and say a forceful no and you leave or you say 'Yes' 
and you continue to fight,' he said<nl/><nl/>The next scalp Tsipras would love to have is that of the 
'uncompromising speaker of parliament, Zoe Constantopoulou, who also defied Tsipras and abstained from the 
vote' although she would require a no confidence vote to be replaced 'but the other rebels would be expected to 
resign their seats, the same people say.'<nl/> And if not resign they will simply be among the first group of party 
leaders sacked, with many more to come as Tsipras effectively morphs into his predecessor Samaras. <nl/> 
According to Reuters, the 40-year-old prime minister 'can not afford to wait' because 'a mini-rebellion of lawmakers 
on Friday laid bare tensions in the ruling Syriza party. The revolt saw 17 deputies from the government benches 
withhold support in a vote to authorise bailout negotiations, leaving Tsipras reliant on opposition parties to pass the 
measure.' <nl/> Dealing with the consequences of that revolt will provide a clear signal of how determined Tsipras 
will be in pushing through the reforms European partners are demanding. <nl/> Whether cooperation with 
opposition parties leads to a full-scale national unity government, with seats in the cabinet is still unclear but the 
change has left the future of the radical leftwing government in doubt. The government has 162 seats in the 300 
seat parliament.<nl/><nl/>Then again after Friday's vote, and following this weekend's crushing blow by the Troika, 
it is almost certain that many Syriza loyalists will exit the party, either voluntarily or otherwise, leaving the ruling 
coalition with a minority vote, which in turn will likely result in a few round of government elections within 2-3 
months. <nl/> However, the purge will be only the first of many hurdles now facing the morally and financially 
bankrupt government:<nl/> Clearing out the leftwingers still defending the anti-bailout platform on which Syriza won 
power in January would underline how seriously the situation has worsened for Greece in the past six months.<nl/> 
With the financial system on the brink of collapse and shuttered banks running short of cash, the six-year Greek 
crisis has escalated dangerously, forcing Tsipras to change course only a week after voters resoundingly rejected a 
milder package of bailout terms in a referendum. <nl/> There are also questions about how stable any such 
government would prove, given the deep ideological differences between Syriza and the centre-right New 
Democracy or Socialist Pasok parties.<nl/><nl/>But the biggest hurdle is not what Tsipras will do to the 
government, but rather what, if anything, the Greek people will do to Tsipras. If they have had enough, they may 
just shift from the 'radical left' to the 'radical right' as the only remaining political party that hasn't promised the sun, 
moon and stars, or been terminally discredited. <nl/> Unless, of course, the population, so disenchanted by the 
endless game of political thrones, becomes the first social manifestation of 'learned helplessness[5]' and simply 
refuses to care, instead opting to go gentle into that good night and with it taking what was once the world's oldest 
democracy.<nl/> [ 1]:            http://www.zerohedge.com/ [ 2]:            http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-07-

http://www.wkrb13.com/images/wrkb-19.jpgBudget flights already can be considered cramped, noisy and stuffy, but 
things could become a great deal worse. 
A patent was recently filed by Zodiac Seats France an airline industry supplier. The patent proposes to squeeze 
even more passengers into planes by turning passengers around so they will be facing one another.<nl/> It would 
have the middle seat in each section of three be reversed meaning that passenger would be facing two other 
people during the flight.<nl/> The diagrams supplied in the patent filing show in detail that arms would intertwine, 
making for a trip that is even more intimate that currently.<nl/> Zodiac has given it the name Economy Class Cabin 
Hexagon, because of the rough shape it creates when looked at from above.<nl/> Zodiac says that along with 
increasing the density of cabin passengers, the passengers themselves would also benefit from additional shoulder 
space.<nl/> This is not any guarantee that the new formation in seating will actually come to fruition, but it is 
another example of how it could become even worse to travel aboard budget airlines.<nl/> This is not the first time 
there has been an attempt by the airline industry to squeeze more people into the economy class cabin.<nl/> 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary as showed interest previously in what are called standing seats as a method of 
lowering prices on plane tickets.<nl/> The way the new hexagon is set up there could be problems when a flight 
experiences turbulence and when someone wants to get out of their seat for whatever reason.<nl/> When the news 
of this first broke, both online and social media news showed that many people were not enthused with what might 
take place.<nl/> Tweets were very critical of the idea saying that it would make flying the discount airlines that much 
more difficult. Others questioned if the saving of having more passengers on board for the airlines was worth 
upsetting and possibly losing overall passenger count due to discontent.<nl/>lade<nl/>

Jul 10, 2015( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ;<nl/> British Airways 
owner International Airlines Group (IAG) is buying Irish national carrier Aer Lingus, after Ryanair rolled over and 
accepted the deal[1].<nl/> IAG has targetted Irish national carrier Aer Lingus for months. 
Its latest €1.36 billion (£961 million) bid was OK'd by the Irish government in late May[2], leaving Aer Lingus' biggest 
shareholder Ryanair the only obstacle.<nl/> Budget airline Ryanair owns 29.8% of Aer Lingus and many thought it 
would try to block the bid. Ryanair has made three unsuccessful attempts to buy Aer Lingus[3]. It is currently under 
orders from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority to sell its stake[4], something Ryanair heavily 
contested[5].<nl/> But Ryanair said today that it has "voted unanimously" to accept the bid from IAG, which owns 
British Airways and Spanish airline Iberia.<nl/> Ryanair's colourful CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement 
today[6]: "We believe the IAG offer for Aer Lingus is a reasonable one in the current market and we plan to accept 
it, in the best interests of Ryanair shareholders. The price means that Ryanair will make a small profit on its 
investment in Aer Lingus over the past 9 years."<nl/> But he couldn't resist a parting dig, adding: "We wish IAG well 
with their takeover of Aer Lingus. When Ryanair first bid for Aer Lingus in late 2006, Ryanair (36m passengers) 
carried 4 times Aer Lingus traffic (9m). Today Ryanair (over 100m) carries more than 10 times Aer Lingus traffic 
(10m), and we will continue to deliver the vast majority of Ireland's traffic and tourism growth in the coming months 
and 
years."<nl/>NOW

Jul 08, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> In line with its 
ambitious five-year expansion plans, Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[1] has decided to introduce 
round-trip flights to Israel for as low as $32.<nl/>Ryanair connects 170 cities in Europe, inclusive of the less popular 
destinations, at reasonable fares. 
Interestingly, Israel is the 31st market to be entered by Ryanair. The inclusion of Israel will certainly enhance 
Ryanair's network in the Middle East.<nl/>Ryanair will flag-off bi-weekly flights starting Nov 2015 from Budapest, 
Kaunas and Krakow to Israel's Ovda airport, near the Red Sea resort town of Eilat. Gradually, the carrier plans to 
expand its service to other Middle East cities. Ryanair also expects to fly nearly 40,000 passengers every year on 
this route.<nl/>Going forward, Ryanair plans to initiate flights from Israel's popular Tel Aviv Ben Gurion airport which 
is being served by carriers like EasyJet, Wizz Air and Norwegian. In 2013, Israel entered into an 'Open Skies' deal 
with the European Union, thereby allowing more direct flight service to other European nations.<nl/>Meanwhile, a 
few days back, Ryanair announced plans of extending its operations from Edinbergh to Copenhagen with three 
weekly services starting Nov 6, 2015.<nl/>Also, to forge ahead with its expansion plans, Ryanair will connect 
around 14 cities like London, Berlin and Dublin in Europe and a dozen locations in the U.S., including cities like 
New York, Boston and Chicago. Moreover, the carrier intends to fly around 100 million passengers this 
year.<nl/>To support such large-scale expansion, Ryanair has decided to expand its fleet size by adding Boeing 
787 Dreamliners. The company has also placed an order for 183 Boeing 737 aircraft and 200 Boeing MAX 200 
planes.<nl/>Recently, the Ryanair reported impressive air traffic numbers for the month of June. Traffic - measured 
in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) - stood at 9.5 million, up 14% from 8.3 million recorded in the comparable 
month a year ago. The load factor for the month was 93% against 88% in Jun 2014. The company also expects 
fiscal 2016 traffic to exceed 100 million with load factor likely to reach 90%.<nl/>Braving all economic odds, Ryanair 
has been performing well over the last 30 years, surpassing the performance of most European carriers. Further, 
we expect Ryanair to gain significantly from the Israel route addition.<nl/>Stocks to Consider<nl/>Ryanair currently 
carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the same space include Deutsche Lufthansa 
Aktiengesellschaft DLAKY[2], SkyWest Inc. SKYW[3] and China Eastern Airlines Corp. Ltd. CEA[4]. All the three 
companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).<nl/>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

initiating a public online campaign aimed at banning the right to strike by air traffic controllers. This will be known as 
the 'Keep Europe's Skies Open[1]' campaign, with the objective of obtaining one million petition signatures to urge 
the EU Commission and the European Parliament to take action.<nl/> The low cost Irish airliner is arguing that this 
campaign is designed to defend consumers from Air Traffic Control (ATC) union strikes.<nl/>           
http://www.neurope.eu/article/ryanair-against-union-action-rights/#socialbuzz-bottom-infinite-view-399570<nl/> The 
kick off of the campaign coincides with a strike that begins on Thursday (2-4, July) by the French ATC union. 
The company argues that since 2009, the French ATC union has gone on strike for 39 days.<nl/> The company 
wants nothing less than removing the right to strike from ATC unions, bringing Europe in line with the US regime. 
Ryanair chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs told the Financial Times that the situation was 'unacceptable,' adding 
that controllers used 'strikes as a first weapon rather than a last resort.'<nl/> Spain's ATC union will strike twice in 
July (11-12 and 25-26), in what is regarded as high season in Europe.<nl/> Alternatively, Ryanair suggests that air

for a crackdown on France's air traffic controllers and it wants the public to help it out.<nl/>
 The budget Irish airline has launched an online petition[1] calling for the European Commission to crackdown on 
the number of strikes French air traffic controllers (ATCs) declare.<nl/> Since 2009, French ATC unions have 
staged 39 days of strike action, according to Ryanair, which caused "cancellations for millions of people across 
Europe."<nl/> The most recent strike on April 12 and 13 caused 3,600 flight cancellations. There are more strikes 
planned this week on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.<nl/> Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs says in a statement[2]: "It's 
unacceptable that Europe's consumers repeatedly have their holiday and travel plans disrupted or cancelled by the 
selfish actions of ATC unions every summer, who use strikes as a first weapon rather than a last resort. <nl/> 
"French ATC unions will again stage three further days of strikes this week, which will impact hundreds of 
thousands of European consumers. It is particularly reprehensible that these strikes are taking place at the height of 
the peak summer season, deliberately targeting holiday makers and families."<nl/> Ryanair wants Europe to ban air 
traffic controllers from striking, in the same way police and military are forbidden, or to let other European air traffic 
controllers to step in and cover for the French during periods of industrial action.<nl/> Ryanair plans to deliver its 
petition, dubbed "Keep Europe's skies open," to Brussels once it hits 1 million signatures. It's not clear how many 
signatures it currently has. You can sign the petition here[3].<nl/>NOW WATCH: How to skip long lines at the

Jun 30, 2015( Voice of America: http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex) ; Monday was the day the music 
died for thousands of song downloaders and music streamers in Greece.
 The imposition of capital controls on Sunday evening means Greeks are no longer able to purchase goods or 
services from many big international online suppliers including Google, Apple and Facebook. Transfers of funds out 
of Greece were banned to prevent a collapse of the banking system after Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras rejected the 
terms of a bailout offer from international lenders. The controls mean payments via debit or credit cards to accounts 
outside Greece are prohibited. This is a problem for the big online retailers, music download sellers and airlines, 
who sell to clients across Europe from centralized transacting subsidiaries, often in Luxembourg or Ireland, and 
often for tax reasons. Since Monday, many Greeks have found they can no longer make payments online to such 
companies. "I tried to pay Facebook three euros for a small advertisement but my card was rejected right away," 
said Greek e-commerce consultant Panayotis Gezerlis. He added that he had also failed to purchase music from 
Google and to make a payment from his bank card via eBay's payment unit, Paypal. Google told Greek clients in a 
Facebook posting that it was working to find a solution. Google's European customers contract with an Irish 
subsidiary when buying advertisements. The system allows the group to pay almost no tax on profits from these 
sales, but also means almost every sale is a cross-border transaction. A spokesman for the Irish airline Ryanair 
said it also was having trouble processing payments from Greek customers, and was working on a solution. Even 
the Taxi hailing service Taxibeat, which was founded in Greece but operates internationally, tweeted on Monday it 
was hoping to be able to offer a viable payment system soon. Gezerlis said while many of the products and 
services affected were not necessities, others, such as file storage and advertising, could cause problems for 
businesses unable to pay. "There are many businesses which rely on Google servers and on Dropbox to share 
files," he said. Many big online providers including Amazon, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Adobe and Expedia did not 
reply to requests for comment.

(25%), Etihad Airways (5%), Ryanair (30%) and other minority shareholders. The company has become the center 
of a regulatory battle for a high stakes take over. The prize is not only traffic from or to Ireland, the U.K, and beyond, 
but mainly the Dublin airport as an alternative transatlantic hub given the congestion of UK's airports, especially 
London's Heathrow.<nl/>           http://www.neurope.eu/article/a-londoners-fight-for-the-skies-of-dublin/#socialbuzz-
bottom-infinite-view-396827<nl/> On Thursday, British Airways (BA) offered concessions in an attempt to win 
EU regulatory approval for the acquisition of 25% of the Irish air carrier Aer Lingus. 
BA is based at London's Heathrow, one of the busiest and more congested airports in the world, a fact that 
significantly limits its capacity for market expansion, especially in lucrative transatlantic services. Dublin is the 
obvious solution to London's problems. The European Commission deadline for bids for the Irish carrier is now 
extended to July 15th.<nl/> Regulatory clearance typically involves unbundling connecting flights and offering 
airport slots. In this case, BA must also secure the agreement of its major rival and 30% shareholder of Aer Lingus, 
namely Ryanair. Ryanair is being forced by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to reduce its stake 
in Aer Lingus to 5%. However, Ryanair has not disclosed whether or not it is willing to sell its share to BA. BA is 
also offering the Irish government €1.4bn for its 25% share of Aer Lingus, but the government still wants further 
assurances.<nl/> The main rival for Aer Lingus is Virgin Atlantic, but it looks like this is not a battle that will be 
fought on the basis of cash alone. Virgin Atlantic had partnered with Aer Lingus to cater to the U.K's domestic 
market and they are worried that this partnership may be undermined after the takeover. In addition, Virgin's share 
of the transatlantic market is likely to be further squeezed. Whilst Virgin does not have the cash to outbid BA, 
regulatory complaints could undermine its rival's bid, especially given the overall negative attitude of the Irish 
government.<nl/><nl/> Share on Facebook<nl/> Share on Twitter<nl/> Share on Google+<nl/> Share on

disrespecting the Danish labour laws as it hires Denmark-based pilots and cabin crew on Irish labour 
contracts.<nl/> Bloomberg reported today that since the entering of Ryanair in Denmark this spring, the company 
has come under nonstop attack from unions, government officials due to its controversial employment 
standards.<nl/>           http://www.neurope.eu/article/bloomberg-ryanair-clashes-with-denmark-over-
labour/#socialbuzz-bottom-infinite-view-395775<nl/> On June 15, Ryanair was summoned by a labour court in 
Copenhagen to explain why it hires Denmark-based pilots and cabin crew on Irish labor contracts. 
Ryanair claimed that the arrangement, which it uses in other countries, is legal and that its Danish employees 'enjoy 
high pay [and] job security.' Still, the critics are accusing Ryanair of using this employment policy to avoid rules on 
wages, social benefits, and worker protections required by Danish laws.<nl/> On January 2015, Thilde Waast, from 
Denmark's FPU trade union, told Denmark's Avisen newspaper about the labour conditions in Ryanair: 'Ryanair 
pilots and flight attendants are working under conditions that are unacceptable to us, so we expect to come into 
conflict with the company…We have no interest in causing trouble for Ryanair, but we have to get an agreement 
with them to work under Danish conditions.' If the labour unions win the case, Ryanair will have to to sign a Danish 
collective agreement within five days.<nl/> Danish investors have also started to withdraw their stake in Ryanair. 
PensionDanmark, a pension fund managing $26 billion of savings from members of 10 Danish labour unions, a 
year ago sold all its Ryanair shares, worth about $7.5 million. According to the Local, other pension funds including 
the country's largest investor ATP also considering selling their shares due to Ryanair's controversial labour 
practices. On May, the mayor of Copenhagen, Frank Jensen, has also banned all 45,000 city official from flying with 
Ryanair - even if it's the cheapest option.<nl/> According to Bloomberg, Ryanair complained to the European Union 
about the restrictions on Danish municipal workers claiming that 'these municipalities are breaking EU law by 
banning their staff from choosing Ryanair's lowest-fare flights.' Moreover, the company said that even if the Danish 
investors sell their shares there are many other willing investors who want to buy the shares.<nl/><nl/> Share on

Jun 23, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Employee-related 
concerns continue to haunt Germany's Deutsche Lufthansa Aktiengesellschaft DLAKY[1]. The largest German 
carrier is now confronted with the possibility of its flight attendants going on strike, unless the company is able to 
come up with an acceptable plan by Jun 30 pertaining to the pay and retirement conditions of its cabin 
crew.<nl/>The ultimatum to the company was served by the Independent Flight Attendants Organization (UFO) 
which represents 19,000 flight attendants of the frequently strike-plagued carrier. 
We remind investors that in Jan 2015, UFO agreed with the company to seek arbitration to resolve disputes related 
to the pay and retirement benefits of the flight attendants. However, efforts by mediators to find an amicable 
solution fell apart. Subsequently, the union rejected the proposal to resume talks with the company.<nl/>UFO has 
now stated that failure on the part of the company to come up with an acceptable solution by Jun 30, 2015 would 
result in the flight attendants going on strike the following day. Moreover, it warned of further strikes that could last 
till Sep 16, thus crippling operations through the busy summer season. This would potentially rob the carrier of 
significant revenues.<nl/>We note that Lufthansa has faced a series of strikes in the recent past, over its supposed 
efforts to reduce costs in a bid to compete effectively with carriers like Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2] and 
Emirates.<nl/>In Mar 2015, pilots of the company went on a four-day strike following the fallout of talks with 
management over early retirement benefits. Furthermore, the carrier's plan to expand low-cost offerings has also 
come under attack from the pilots. The strike was the 14th such move by the carrier's pilots since Apr 2014. 
However, pilots have as of now agreed not to go on strike further till Jul 31, 2015 as the dispute is currently in the 
hands of mediators.<nl/>The ongoing dispute with the pilots has already resulted in massive flight cancellations and 
loss of profit for the carrier. The latest row with its flight attendants represents a fresh challenge for the 
company.<nl/>Zacks Rank<nl/>Lufthansa currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Equally well-ranked

Jun 19, 2015( Adrian Swinscoe - RARE Business Growth ...rketing: http://www.adrianswinscoe.com/blog/ Delivered 
by Newstex) ;<nl/> Nunwood[1], a customer experience research and consultancy firm, recently published their 
U.S. Customer Experience Excellence Report 2015 and I was lucky enough to get the chance to talk to David 
Conway, their Chief Strategy Officer, about the report and their findings[2].<nl/> In our interview[3], he suggested 
that:<nl/>
In broad terms the U.S. is probably two to three years ahead of the U.K. in customer experience terms; and The top 
U.S. brands are about 5% ahead of their U.K. counterparts across a number of dimensions and Nunwood estimates 
that it will take U.K. brands two to three years to catch up.<nl/>One of the main reasons, he cited for this 
discrepancy is that they have found that:<nl/><nl/>'the customer experience agenda is largely driven by the CEO 
and the executive team in the U.S. and that is a key difference between the U.S. and the U.K., where the customer 
experience agenda is being driven, in large part, by the operational team.'<nl/><nl/>I would suggest that these 
differences are not limited to U.K. firms but are shared, in many respects, across European firms.<nl/> However, 
one European firm that seems to bucking that trend is Ryanair[4].<nl/> Now, I wrote a bit of a skeptical article about 
them and their CEO, Michael O'Leary, last month where I asked: Does Michael O'Leary Really Care About 
Ryanair's Customers, Or Is He Just Being Pragmatic?[5], largely because of Mr. O'Leary's historical reputation for 
saying a number of not very flattering things about customers.<nl/> On the back of that article, Mr. O'Leary sent me 
a personal letter and also agreed to be interviewed by me about Ryanair's new programme of customer service 
initiatives.<nl/> In his letter (published with permission) and to answer my question whether or not he cared about 
his customers, Mr. O'Leary wrote:<nl/><nl/>'I am the only airline Chief Executive that really cares about my 
customers which is why I have spent 28 years driving down the cost of flying in Europe[6], this year Ryanair will 
carry over 100m passengers and save those passengers more than €10n compared to the average airfares being 
charged by our competitors in Europe'.<nl/><nl/>However, it was our interview (you can read the highlights and 
listen to the full interview here[7]) that provided the most interesting insights:<nl/>Humility is the biggest lesson he 
has learned in the last 12 months, even if as he says 'It's very difficult for someone who is Irish to be humble. We 
generally believe that we walk on water'. Listening to customers has been a 'spectacularly successful learning 
experience for Ryanair over the last 12 months' and they are seeing the changes that they have implemented 
reflected in their business results too. Do as much as you can to be nice to your customers but stay true to your 
business model. Ryanair know that service and improving their customers' experience is good but only as long as it 
doesn't threaten their cost leadership position. Investing[8] in being nicer to customers should fuel and add to your 
The humility of Ryanair 's CEO is driving the improvement of their customer experience
strategy but shouldn't dominate or replace it.<nl/>What's clear is that it is Mr. O'Leary's humility and ability to admit 
that he has made mistakes that are the main driving forces behind Ryanair's customer service improvements.<nl/> 
There are lessons here for other CEOs facing similar challenges.<nl/> Like the recent report released by Heidrick 
...ruggles: The CEO Report[9] states:<nl/><nl/>'Sometimes you have to have the courage to say, 'I know this is the 
right direction,' the humility to say when you've got it wrong and deal with it, but the courage to take action when 
you believe it's the right thing to do—despite the downside potential for yourself.'<nl/><nl/><nl/> This post was

The trend for domestic tourism has been negative, consistently declining from 2009 to 2013. This has been due to 
Belgian residents following a cautious approach in terms of spending on travel as the economy has not performed 
well. 
GDP at constant prices, when measured in national currency, grew at CAGR of 1.11% from 2009 to 2014. This 
implies that Belgian residents do not have much disposable income available to them, which limits their spending 
power. However, growth of 1.7% was recorded in 2014 and domestic trips are projected to reach 2.9 million by 
2019<nl/>All categories witness a decline in 2009, with business tourism experiencing maximum decline due to the 
global recession, meaning there were far fewer inbound trips for business purposes. Countries in Western Europe, 
such as the Netherlands, France, and Germany were adversely affected by the Euro crisis, which meant there was 
almost negligible growth in inbound tourism during 2012 and 2013 as these are major source countries for tourism 
in Belgium (collectively account for about 60% of the trips. Inbound spending is likely to reach EUR14.2 billion 
(US$201.1 billion) by 2019<nl/>Travel agents play an important role when booking trips such as airline and hotel 
reservations; however, their role is gradually changing. Now, most people browse hotel and airline websites and 
book their flights, hotels, and holiday packages directly. As of January 1, 2014, travel agents no longer require a 
license, which reduces barriers to entry. <nl/>Over the forecast period (2015-2019), their role will transition from 
agents involved in the selling of holidays to consultants advising tourists about a destination<nl/>Brussels Airlines, 
the flag carrier of Belgium, has been gradually losing market share due to the entry of LCCs. Irish LCC Ryanair 
plans to increase its passengers through Belgian airports by 20% in 2015, by adding five new routes to Belgium in 
its 2015 summer timetable<nl/><nl/>For more information on the "Travel and Tourism in Belgium to 2019" market

Jun 16, 2015( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> They've made it 
despite the odds. But only after years of tireless work in a male-dominated world. DW's Manuela Kasper-Claridge 
reports from the fourth "Fortune Most Powerful Women" summit in London. 
Carolyn McCall is no stranger to the spotlight, but even she looks like she can't quite believe they've all come to 
London's posh Rosewood Hotel because of her - their role model. But in the world of businesswomen, the 53-year-
old Brit is a super star - the quintessential leader.<nl/> McCall is the chief executive of Easyjet and has managed to 
do what many deemed impossible when she took the job back in 2010. Alongside Ryanair, Easyjet is now Europe's 
most successful low-cost carrier. Under McCall, the company's revenue has doubled and the airline now flies to 70 
European destinations.<nl/> Cheap and on time<nl/> So, what's behind her success?<nl/> "Low fares and good 
services go hand in hand," McCall said. But that wasn't what Easyjet was known for, when she over the reins. The 
company's reputation had hit rock bottom, and customers were running away in droves, turning instead to the 
competition. To win back customers, one of the first things she did was to make sure that all flights left and arrived 
on time.<nl/> But McCall knew this was just a drop in the bucket and that there would be even greater challenges 
ahead. Sure, she was known as a successful executive, having previously headed the Guardian Media Group, but 
she was far from an aviation expert. Meanwhile, Easyjet was racking up losses, and executives were at 
loggerheads with each other.<nl/> Still, she said, "I can do it." Five years later, the Easyjet chief is widely regarded 
as one of the UK's most successful businesswomen.<nl/> Female power<nl/> The women in the audience are 
glued to her lips. Many of them can tell similar stories of tough management decisions and the pressure exerted by 
shareholders and colleagues.<nl/> The "Most Powerful Women" conference in London brings together successful 
female executives who are invited by the US magazine "Fortune." Among them are bankers, entrepreneurs, 
lawyers and consultants, mainly from Europe, but also from the US, India, China and the Middle East. And all of 
them are surrounded by men cultivating their own male-dominated networks.<nl/> 50 billion and 9 kids<nl/> Helena 
Morrissey is a living example of female power. The slender woman is in charge of Newton Investment, a 50-billion-
pound (69-billion-euro, $78-billion) fund. She's a staunch opponent of a female quota system and has made a 
splash with her "30% Club," launched in 2010. Its goal is to increase the number of women represented on the UK's 
top 100 corporate boards to 30 percent by 2015, but through voluntary, rather than mandatory, means.<nl/> "At the 
moment we stand at 23.6% representation, this is up from 12.6 percent," Morrisey said proudly.<nl/> One of the big 
challenges is to get companies to broaden their horizon when looking for candidates to fill open board positions. 
Many simply aren't aware that for each male candidate, there's often an equally qualified female. By recommending 
suitable talent, the initiative makes sure that women increasingly pop up on directors' radars.<nl/> Today, the 30% 
Club has expanded to include branches in South Africa, the US, Ireland and Hong Kong. And it's not just women 
'I can do it!': Summit celebrates powerful women
who support the initiative. The organization also counts several male top managers among its members.<nl/> 
Emerging from her father's shadow<nl/> Ana Botin, head of Spanish banking dynasty Santander Group, is also in 
London to share her experiences. Today, the 54-year-old scion is one of the world's most powerful banking 
executives. But this wasn't always the case.<nl/> For years, she lived in the shadow of her notorious father, Emilio 
Botin. When he died in 2014, the board of directors unanimously appointed her chair of the Group. After graduating 
Harvard Business School and an eight-year stint at JP Morgen, she returned to Spain to work for Santander, 
Europe's second-biggest institution. In 2010, she took over at the helm of Santander UK.<nl/> When Botin took over 
from her father, she didn't miss a beat. She soon made headlines for her decisive leadership, replacing several key 
figures at the top and ringing in a new era for the company that left no room to rest on the company's laurels.<nl/> 
But it wasn't a tough decisions, she told the audience in London. After all, it wasn't her first time working for the 
family business.<nl/> "It's always easier to change from inside," said Botin. "The biggest challenge is to find the 
right talent."<nl/> Image is (almost) everything<nl/> One thing her father taught her early on was that being a leader 
is about more than being the best, it's also about projecting the right image.<nl/> "I just concentrated on doing the 
best I could. But I learned that wasn't enough," reflected Botin.<nl/> The women in the audience nodded their heads 
knowingly.<nl/>

Accessibility to Lithuania from the UK is on the rise as Wizz Air is set to introduce a flight between Glasgow and the 
Lithuanian capital, Vilnius. 
It will be the first time Vilnius has been served as a destination from Glasgow Airport and Wizz Air will operate a 
year round, twice weekly service starting on 16 September 2015.<nl/>Wizz Air is the largest low-cost airline in 
Central and Eastern Europe and Paul White, business development manager at Glasgow Airport said "the new 
Vilnius service will no doubt prove extremely popular with both Lithuanian and Scottish passengers." Daniel de 
Carvalho, Corporate Communications Manager at Wizz Air echoed these sentiments as he announced that fares 
will be starting from only £18.49.<nl/>UK access to Lithuania is already well established with flights leaving from 
London, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Birmingham, Doncaster and Bristol. Wizzair offer flights to Vilnius while Ryan Air was 
the first carrier to set direct flights from Scotland in 2010 with a service running twice a week from Edinburgh Airport 
to Kaunas and from Liverpool and London Stansted to Vilnius. Kaunas International Airport is the second busiest 
civil airport in Lithuania after Vilnius Airport and as the second largest city in Lithuania, located just an hour's drive 
from Vilnius, less than a three hour flight to either of these cities will take visitors to a treasure trove of natural 
beauty; Vilnius' baroque old town, Ninth Fort, Trakai Castle and the Curonian Spit are just a few gems waiting to be 
discovered and part of what put Lithuania 3rd in Lonely Planet's Top Countries for 2015 and Europe's best kept 
secret.<nl/>For more information on Lithuania see www.Lithuania.travel<nl/>-ENDS- <nl/>For more information

After a 6% decline in 2012 due to the bankruptcy of the national carrier Malév, transportation recovered in 2013 
showing 3% value sales growth. After bankruptcy of Malév, air transportation was characterised by share takeover 
by low cost carriers, especially Wizzair and Ryanair. In 2013, this competition along with other low cost carriers 
turned into consolidation amongst the bigger players.<nl/>Value sales of transportation in Hungary declined by 6% 
in 2012, after significant growth of 7% in 2011. The decline in value sales of transportation was prompted by a value 
decline in air and growth of 4% in other transportation in 2012. Air was seriously affected by the bankruptcy of the 
main national air carrier, Malév Hungarian Airlines Rt, in February 2012. There was a decline of 5% in the number

Ryanair launched flights from Athens E Venizelos Airport to Rome, Milan, London, Brussels and Paphos as well as 
Crete, Rhodes and Thessaloniki in spring 2014. This is set to boost tourism and lead to fierce competition by forcing 
other airlines to drop their prices in order to compete. Pressure will be strong, particularly on the prices of domestic 
flights, which until recently were only marginally cheaper than international ones, making air travel largely

Student Changes His Name Because It's Cheaper Than Changing Flight Booking
Student Changes His Name Because It's Cheaper Than Changing Flight

Jun 05, 2015( The Huffington Post: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> We all know that 
booking a flight is a constant tactical battle with airlines[1].<nl/>But no passenger has won (or lost?)
 the booking war as heroically as 19-year-old Adam Armstrong. The student from Manchester, England, changed 
his name to Adam West because it was cheaper than changing his Ryanair flight booking[2].<nl/>The airline wanted 
to charge him $337 to change a mistake on his ticket. He told The Sun[3] that his stepfather accidentally booked 
him as "Adam West," because that's what he called himself on his Facebook page.<nl/>"Her stepdad got my name 
from Facebook but I had put it as Adam West as a joke, because he was the actor who played Batman on TV," 
West said.<nl/>Ryanair is known for its cheap flights but ample fees for any changes or services[4]. It charges $69 
to check in at the airport, for example. The airline wanted to charge West twice for his change because he and his 
girlfriend were both on the booking.<nl/>Instead of giving in, the teen went rogue. He changed his name (for free) 
and will fly to Ibiza as Adam West next week, the Daily Mail reports[5]. The Guardian reports that he did have to pay 
about $157[6] to change his passport, however.<nl/><nl/>Ryanair released a statement[7] to explain that the rule 
was in place to deter scammers:<nl/> Customers are asked to ensure that the details they enter at the time of 
booking are correct before completing their booking and we offer a 24 hour 'grace period' to correct minor booking 
errors. A name change fee is charged in order to discourage and prevent unauthorized online travel agents from 
'screenscraping' Ryanair's cheapest fares and reselling them on to unwitting consumers at hugely inflated costs.

Jun 05, 2015( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ;<nl/> Ryanair is a no-
frills European budget airline that charges high fees for any extras.<nl/>
 And when we mean anything extra, £15 ($23) for printing off your boarding pass if you didn't print it off at home or 
even £30 ($46) upwards for checking in a bag. <nl/> So when Adam Armstrong, 19, found out that it would cost 
£220 ($337) in "admin fees" to get his name corrected on a Ryanair ticket, he opted to change his name by deed 
poll instead because it was cheaper, as originally reported in The Sun newspaper.<nl/> Ryanair says it charges 
steep fees to correct names in order to prevent ticket reselling fraud.<nl/> Armstrong is booked to go on holiday to 
Ibiza next week with his girlfriend, India Lomas, 17. However, her father booked his ticket under the name "Adam 
West" after looking at his Facebook profile. Armstrong had used the name "Adam West" in homage to the original 
Batman actor.<nl/> However, Armstrong found out that he would be charged double the usual £110 admin fee[1] for 
changing a name on a ticket because his girlfriend was listed on the same booking, according to The Sun.<nl/> He 
changed his name for free via deed poll, then paid £103 ($158) for a new passport — less than the amount he 
would have paid if the fee had not been doubled.<nl/> On Today FM's "Anton Savage Show" this morning in 
Ireland[2], Armstrong (now West) said "yeah, I'm not giving Ryanair a penny."<nl/> Ryanair told Business Insider: 
<nl/> Customers are asked to ensure that the details they enter at the time of booking are correct before completing 
their booking and we offer a 24 hour 'grace period' to correct minor booking errors.<nl/> A name change fee is 
charged in order to discourage and prevent unauthorised online travel agents from "screenscraping" Ryanair's 
cheapest fares and reselling them on to unwitting consumers at hugely inflated costs. <nl/> Under our 'Always 
Getting Better' improvement programme, we have reduced our baggage, sports equipment, airport check-in and 
missed departure fees, as we continue to improve the Ryanair travel experience for the 100 million customers we'll 
carry this year.<nl/>NOW WATCH: A Japanese lifestyle guru explains how to organize your home once — and then

Jun 05, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> The monthly data 
released by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) revealed a 5.9% year-over-year increase in demand 
for air travel across the globe for the month of April 2015. The rise was attributable to an increase in both 
international and domestic traffic (measured in revenue passenger kilometers) in the month. The report also 
revealed a 6.1% rise in capacity (measured in available seat kilometers). The greater increase in capacity 
compared with air traffic resulted in the load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) declining 10 basis 
points (bps) to 79.4% in April.<nl/>International Traffic<nl/>
The 5.2% increase in International demand was driven by strong performance of carriers from the Asia-Pacific, 
Latin America and Middle East.<nl/>International traffic in the Asia-Pacific region registered a handsome 9% growth 
on a 6% rise in capacity. The greater increase in traffic compared with capacity led to a 220 bps rise in load factor 
to 78.3%. Carriers in the Middle East which include the likes of Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways reported an 
8.2% increase in April traffic on the strength of the economy to withstand the weak oil revenues. However, the 
greater increase in capacity (13.3%) resulted in the load factor declining 360 bps to 77.2% for carriers in the 
region.<nl/>International traffic for Latin American carriers which include the likes of GOL Linhas Aereas 
Inteligentes S.A. GOL[1] and Copa Holdings SA CPA[2] for the month was up 6.3% on a 7.3% rise in capacity. 
International April traffic for European carriers which include the likes of Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] climbed 3.7% 
on a 4.7% rise in capacity. Economic stimulus boosted demand for carriers in the region. African carriers 
disappointed in the month with both traffic and capacity declining due to weakness in the economy.<nl/>Strong 
Dollar Hurts North American Carriers<nl/>The IATA monthly report however did not reveal healthy traffic data for 
the carriers in North America. International traffic for carriers like United Continental Holdings Inc. UAL[4], Delta Air 
Lines DAL[5], Southwest Airlines Co. LUV[6], JetBlue Airways Corporation JBLU[7] and Alaska Air Group Inc. 
ALK[8] inched up 0.7% with the strength of the U.S. dollar hampering international leisure travel into the U.S. 
Capacity improved 4.1% and load factor fell 260 basis points to 78.1% due to greater increase in 
capacity.<nl/>Mixed Picture for Summer Travel<nl/>The IATA said that although weak fuel prices have emerged as 
a boon for aviation companies given the inverse relation between fuel costs and the value of airline stocks, the 
outlook for carriers is a mixed one as far as the impending busy summer season in the northern hemisphere is 
concerned. According to the forecast, the strength of the U.S. dollar is likely to a dampener.<nl/>India, China Boost 
Domestic Traffic<nl/>According to the report, domestic travel demand ran the show in April. Stellar domestic traffic 
growth in India (20.7%) and China (15.5%) boosted domestic passenger traffic by 7.2%. However, domestic 
demand (up only 1.7%) in Russia was weak during the month with the economy in recession. The domestic traffic 
Global Air Travel Demand Up in April, North America Sluggish - Analyst Blog
picture in the U.S. was better than the broader international space, with the metric reporting a 4.3% 
growth.<nl/>Total domestic capacity for the month climbed 6.4% and load factor climbed 60 bps to 80.8% driven by 
the greater increase in traffic. Russia revealed the greatest imbalance between traffic and capacity with the latter 
rising 13.2% and leading to empty planes.<nl/>Air Freight Demand Weak<nl/>IATA said that the 3.3% increase in 
global cargo volumes was much less than 4.3% growth witnessed in the first three months of the year. Air cargo 
volume is a key indicator of business confidence. Weak world trade growth was blamed for the weakness in 
demand growth for air freight.<nl/>Slowdown in the Asia Pacific region was the main culprit. Carriers in the Middle 
East registered a healthy 14.1% growth in air freight demand. The increase was attributable to the expansion of 
network and capacity that has encouraged air freight to go through hubs in the Middle East.<nl/>Want the latest

Jun 01, 2015( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Ohayou gozaimasu, 
everyone! I'm back from a week in Japan and it was fantastic. Stay tuned for trip reports in business class on an 
ANA 787 and Suites class on a Singapore A380. Both were excellent, as you'd probably expect. 
But those aren't ready yet. For now, let's get back to the business of airlines.<nl/> There were a lot of things that 
caught my eye last week, but I can't write about them all. Today, I thought I'd talk about the culmination of a long 
process. IAG, parent company of British Airways, Iberia, and Vueling, has finally convinced the Irish government to 
allow it to add Aer Lingus to its trophy case[1]. The deal really is a good one for both sides.<nl/><nl/>IAG has been 
trying to purchase Aer Lingus for quite some time now, but opposition from the government (which owns a quarter 
of the airline) was holding it back. It took some guarantees to maintain the brand and service levels into the UK in 
order to get the Irish government to come around. Yes, Ryanair still owns nearly 30 percent of the airline as well, 
but it has to sell all but 5 percent of that[2] (though this is still under appeal). Regardless of what Ryanair decides to 
do[3], it likely won't kill the deal.<nl/> That doesn't mean that this is officially done though. The EU still has to sign 
off on it from an anti-trust perspective. But we're at a point now where I'd be surprised if this didn't happen. And it's 
a good thing, for the most part.<nl/> There were three big concerns that were specific to this deal that caused some 
hesitation. Some of these were really unfounded.<nl/> Losing Its Airline<nl/>One of the concerns was that Ireland 
would lose its national airline and would just become a set of routes in another airline based elsewhere. While that 
might make more sense if it were possible, that's not how IAG's model works. IAG prefers airlines to keep 
independent brands with separate management teams, as evidenced by the way it handles British Airways, Iberia, 
and Vueling.<nl/>That doesn't mean Aer Lingus will just do whatever it wants as a completely independent arm, 
however. We know that that deal is going to bring Aer Lingus into the joint venture with American over the Atlantic. 
Aer Lingus will also join oneworld and start using Avios as its frequent flier point currency. And you know there will 
be plenty of 'synergies' along the way that will be discovered.<nl/> To placate the government, IAG formally agreed 
to keep the Aer Lingus brand as an airline based in Ireland. This wasn't a stretch anyway.<nl/><nl/> Slash and 
Burn<nl/>Another concern is that Aer Lingus would see major cuts in the same way that Iberia did. But there's a big 
difference here. Under its previous regime, Christoph Mueller already did the slashing that Aer Lingus needed to 
become viable, and it has been making money. Iberia was a bloated company that was in desperate need of 
change to even have a chance of profitability when IAG showed up. Aer Lingus is fairly well-positioned, so the 
concern about slashing and burning should be minimal.<nl/><nl/>Heathrow<nl/>The last concern is probably the 
most valid. Aer Lingus holds a lot of slots at Heathrow and uses them to fly to various cities in Ireland. Some think 
IAG wants those slots for British Airways to use on other routes. That's fair, but it should also happen to some 
The Irish Government Wisely Agrees to Let IAG Buy Aer Lingus
extent. After all, if BA and Aer Lingus both fly Heathrow to Dublin, then why not fly fewer flights with bigger airplanes 
and then use the remaining slots for something else? I suppose the bigger concern from the government is that 
smaller cities will simply lose flights to Heathrow entirely. That's a very fair concern.<nl/>To compensate for that, 
IAG says it will commit to maintaining existing schedules between Heathrow and Dublin, Shannon, and Cork for 7 
years. All other Aer Lingus Heathrow slots will be used for flights to Ireland for 5 years, though it doesn't say on 
which routes. And that commitment was enough to get the Irish government to make a move.<nl/><nl/> Beyond 
that, of course, there are the usual merger concerns. Will this be good for travelers? Will it be anti-competitive? The 
EU needs to consider that now.<nl/> For passengers, there is a lot of good here. Joining the IAG empire will mean 
people in Ireland will have seamless access into a much bigger network. And the airline's re-entrance into oneworld 
(it was a member for several years) is also going bring more benefits. Plus, IAG expects to grow Dublin as a 
Transatlantic jumping-off point.<nl/> There are some areas of concern. First is Heathrow since there isn't 
competition from there to Ireland if this goes through. But Ryanair has such an enormous presence from Ireland to 
other London airports and Europe in general that this should be a fairly minor concern.<nl/> Transatlantic 
competition may be another area to think about. After all, there are very few airlines outside of the big three 
alliances that fly over the Atlantic these days. Aer Lingus has been a lower fare carrier, especially in relation to one 
way pricing. It would seem likely that this would change, but then again, maybe not. IAG may find that the Aer 
Lingus strategy is a good strategy to use for that carrier. As we saw with Vueling, IAG isn't necessarily looking to 
have a single strategy over every carrier it owns. It just wants the right strategy for that carrier.<nl/> Assuming this 
does go through, we'll find out how this plays out soon enough. But I tend to believe this is a smart move.<nl/> [ 1]:

nl/>Podcast: Play in new window[2] | Download[3]<nl/>
<nl/>Today's interview is with Scott Pulsipher, President ...O of Needle[4], a US software firm that is pioneering 
advocate-assisted commerce. Scott joins me today to talk about what Needle are up to, trust, customer experience 
and advocate-assisted commerce.<nl/> This interview follows on from my recent interview: A degree of humility 
always succeeds in business - Interview with Michael O'Leary of Ryanair[5] - and is number 145 in the series of 
interviews[6] with authors and business leaders that are doing great things, helping businesses innovate and 
delivering great service and experience to their customers.<nl/> Highlights of my interview with Scott:<nl/>Needle is 
pioneering advocate-assisted commerce. In online commerce we are often faced with a lack of trust and access to 
trusted advice when making purchases. What if businesses could allow their own customers and advocates to help 
new customers? Doing so would dramatically improve the customer's experience and increase the likelihood that 
customers would find and buy what they are looking for. Scott quotes some Forrester research that says that only 
20% of us trust the associates of the company that we are doing business with. Needle works with firms that are 
selling what they call 'considered purchases', where they are generally at a higher price point, often entail extensive 
usage after purchase and where there are lots of different options. Scott tells the story of Carhartt[7], who provide 
technical workwear. Needle helped them find and engage their advocates such that when a Carhartt shopper is 
displaying certain behaviours on the Carhartt site, the shopper will get an invite (pop-up) that will ask them if they 
would like to 'chat' with a Carhartt expert/customer that may be able to help them with any purchasing questions 
they have. If the customer clicks yes then this tends to lead to a dramatic increase in the customer being able to 
locate the right product, higher customer satisfaction and NPS as well as higher and more frequent purchases. This 
can lead to a 6-10 fold increase in conversion over a self-service customer and a 10-25% increase in the average 
order value. All of the advocates are clearly identified through their bio and picture as fans of the company, experts 
and purchasers of the company's products. Advocates are rewarded primarily through 3 things: products, brand 
experiences and cash. Advocates' primary motivation is that they want to help. They love to receive products and 
exclusive brand experiences but the cash element also has to be enough that they are willing to show up and do 
'work'. Advocates also receive a schedule of when they are to be 'live' and helping customers just like any other

role. There are advocates for everything out there so this is not an exclusively large brand opportunity. For 
ecommerce businesses this would mean that they would need in excess of 500,000 visits per month to their site to 
ensure that the right amount of community can be developed. This could help firms scale their sales efforts and 
drive incremental revenue without increasing headcount. To identify if this could be for your firm then first identify 
the higher price point product category that has great engagement but low conversion rates and start there. The 
majority of online businesses are pre-occupied with traffic and how to increase it. However, Scott advocates that a 
$1 spent on trust, engagement and community will generate a return 10-fold higher return than a $1 spent on 
driving higher traffic. Not everyone understands advocacy and not everyone trusts what their advocates might do. 
But, when Needle works with their clients they experience big uplifts in satisfaction and NPS as well as significant 
increases in conversion, average order value, loyalty and incremental revenue.<nl/>About Scott (taken from his 
Needle bio[8])<nl/> Scott Pulsipher is the President ...O of Needle[9].<nl/> Scott was previously the general 
manager of Amazon Webstore, a division of Amazon Services, where he directed overall strategy and global go-to-
market efforts. Under his leadership, Amazon Webstore was launched in the US and Europe, and rapidly scaled to 
support the ecommerce business of tens of thousands of companies. Prior to Amazon, Scott was the senior vice 
president of Products and Marketing for Sterling Commerce, which was acquired by IBM in 2010. Scott received his 
MBA from Harvard University. When not working, Scott tries to keep up with his family of six children, while 
sneaking in the occasional round of golf or day of skiing.<nl/> You can find Scott on LinkedIn here[10] and on

May 28, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> In sync with its 
capacity expansion plans, premium U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines DAL[1] plans to initiate flights from the Seattle-
Tacoma International Airport to Boston, Orlando, Pasco, Wash and Victoria and British Columbia. Further, the 
carrier will extend its existing Bozeman, MT, service from the Seattle hub.<nl/>
Notably, Victoria will be the latest addition to Delta's network, subject to approval from the Canadian government. 
Delta will operate daily flights from Seattle to Orlando and Boston starting Dec 19, 2015 and Apr 4, 2016, 
respectively. Likewise, the company will run three daily flights from Seattle to Pasco and Victoria effective Nov 1, 
2015 and Apr 4, 2016, respectively.<nl/>Delta will be operating Boeing 737-800 and 757-200 aircraft for servicing 
Boston and Orlando clients while 65-seat CRJ-700 jets will be used for Bozeman, Pasco and Victoria.<nl/>Of late, 
the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport has been gaining significant importance for Delta's operations. The 
company has already invested $15 million to improve the facilities at the airport and plans to flag off nearly 128 
fights from there to 36 locations.<nl/>Earlier, Delta had filed for regulatory approval to connect Orlando, FL and Sao 
Paulo, Brazil. The company also intends to introduce non-stop flights on the route effective Dec 19, 2015, following 
the authorization.<nl/>We believe that network expansion will not only drive air traffic for Delta but will also help the 
carrier gain greater market traction in Seattle in comparison to Alaska Air Group, Inc. ALK[2].<nl/>Delta currently 
carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the airline space include Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[3]

EU carriers battle Gulf airlines' expansion
EU carriers battle Gulf airlines' expansion

Length: 862 words

May 28, 2015( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Gulf-based airlines 
Etihad, Qatar, and Emirates have been rapidly expanding their networks in Europe, from German feeder cities like 
Berlin and Cologne. But Europe's flag carriers and their US allies are fighting back. 
Airlines based in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have launched a full-pronged attack on the European aviation 
market by expanding long-haul service in Germany and creating hubs in cities like Italy's business capital Milan. But 
a coalition of EU-based airlines, backed by their US airline partners, alleges the Gulf airlines are benefitting from 
government subsidies that give them an unfair advantage.<nl/> "The gulf carriers are subsidized by their national 
treasuries," said Jill Zuckman, spokesperson for Open and Fair Skies, a lobbying group backed by US and 
European airlines. "They can do whatever they want, like fly the biggest planes from small German cities, because 
they are subsidized," Zuckman added.<nl/> Tough market place<nl/> European aviation authorities, however, have 
begun to strike back. Earlier this week, Dutch authorities froze Gulf carriers' flights at existing levels to prevent them 
from increasing to twice daily flights at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport.<nl/> It's a move that Zuckman says is long 
overdue - and one she hopes the US will follow. "In the US, we are hoping to get a resolution before the country's 
aviation system is damaged in the same way the European system has been damaged."<nl/> European carriers 
like Air France-KLM and Lufthansa are increasingly finding themselves in a squeeze: while low-cost carriers like 
Ryanair and EasyJet have won over budget travellers, the Gulf carriers - with their on-board showers and private 
suites - are picking off the top-end flyers. <nl/> Combine that with numerous labor strikes and the higher cost of 
doing business in Europe, and the EU airlines find themselves in a bind.<nl/> Fifth freedom factor <nl/> EU and US 
airlines also question the Gulf airlines' use of fifth freedom rights - these rules permit airlines to fly between cities 
outside of their home countries. A Delta flight between Singapore and Tokyo or a Lufthansa flight between Kuala 
Lumpur and Bangkok would be considered an example.<nl/> The flights are supposed to feed traffic to flights that 
route back to airlines' home markets, but many airlines sell seats on these fifth freedom flights without requiring 
flyers to continue onward to the airline's home market.<nl/> Emirates' Milan to New York fifth freedom flight is seen 
as a major bone of contention. US and EU airlines say that because Emirates is state owned and subsidized, it can 
test out new routes like the Milan-JFK route with new airplanes like the Airbus A380, and sell tickets on those flights 
at below-market rates. <nl/> Emirates counters that the route - underserved after Alitalia cut service a year earlier - 
connects Italy's business hub and wealthiest region to New York, and thus makes perfect sense.<nl/> In Germany, 
Abu Dhabi-based Etihad is seen as posing a major threat to German flag carrier Lufthansa. Etihad offers direct 
flights to Abu Dhabi from Cologne, Hamburg, Dusseldorf, and Berlin. It has also made significant investments in 
European airlines like Aer Lingus, Air Serbia, airberlin, and Alitalia.<nl/> A study by Richard Klophaus of the 
Competence Center Aviation Management at Worms University of Applied Sciences Etihad's, notes that these 
EU carriers battle Gulf airlines' expansion
investments could allow Etihad to create a steady stream of European traffic that could sustain several fifth freedom 
trans-Atlantic services - further cutting into routes presently served by EU and US carriers. <nl/> However, 
Klophaus says that's unlikely to happen right now due to "regulatory constraints and commercial reasons."<nl/> 
Intense competition<nl/> The Gulf carriers have also decimated flights between India and the United States through 
Europe. In 2008, Gulf airlines accounted for 2.8 percent of booked seats from Dallas Fort Worth to Mumbai, and 
US/European airlines took 81.1 percent of booked seats.<nl/> But by 2014, that had flipped completely - with Gulf 
carriers scooping up about 69.6 percent of booking share on this route, and the share of European/US airlines 
slipping to 28.7 percent.<nl/> Experts like Zuckman say that's because the Gulf airlines are able to offer rock-
bottom prices on brand new airplanes. Her trade group says that Etihad, Emirates, and Qatar airways are 
subsidized to the tune of $42 billion through loans and free landing fees. That has meant intense competition - not 
only for US and EU airlines, but even among the Gulf airlines themselves, who are engaged in a sort of race to the 
bottom to offer the cheapest fares possible, Zuckman stresses.<nl/> It's still unclear whether the US will follow the 
Dutch in freezing the number of flights the Gulf carriers are allowed to operate from American airports. Zuckman, for 
her part, says the Gulf airlines seem to be taking the threat seriously.<nl/> "They are sort of racing around the clock 
to add new flights to the US before a freeze might be imposed," she noted.<nl/>

<nl/> The time for bargain hunters and frequent fliers in Germany has never been better. 
There are more cheap flight connections and offers than ever before. Early 2015 looks set to be a record year for 
cheap flights in Germany. Low cost carriers covered some 518 connections to and from Germany, which meant 
they exceeded their prior record of 507 connections, set during the winter 2011 flight schedule, according to the 
DLR German air and space travel agency's latest "Low Cost Monitor" (LCM) report. It logged 4,800 take-offs per 
week by low cost carriers in January 2015 - a new record in itself. There was also a marked increase in flight 
connections within Germany, as well as flights between Germany and Great Britain. <nl/> According to DLR 
statistics, Germanwings - with some 1,800 lift-offs per week and a market share of 38 percent - has managed to 
push ailing competitor AirBerlin off the top spot. This development also had to do with Germanwings taking over a 
lot of domestic flight connections outside of the travel hubs of Munich and Frankfurt from its parent group Lufthansa. 
AirBerlin meanwhile reduced its cheap airfare offer down to 1,700 flights a week. <nl/> Until recently there was no 
real competition in Germany among the low cost carriers - some 87 percent of connections, according to the DLR, 
are serviced only by cheap flight operators. But that is about to change, partly because major European low cost 
carrier Ryanair will be increasing competition. For years, the Irish company focused on flights to and from remote 
airports in the provinces, but now they are increasing their activity in big airport hubs like Berlin, Brussels, Cologne-
Bonn and Rome. "On those connections where there is competition, we expect the prices to continue to sink", said

May 27, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Recently, Irish low-
cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[1] reported robust financial and operating numbers with net profit for the 
year ended Mar 2015 rising 66% year over year to €867 million. Moreover, load factor increased by 500 basis 
points to stand at 88% while air traffic jumped 11% to 90.6 million.<nl/>
Such a strong performance by Ryanair was mainly supported by low fuel prices, attractive fares, continuous route 
expansion, allocated seating and the introduction of an extra carry-on luggage facility. Moreover, to enhance 
passenger satisfaction, the carrier launched an AGB program addressing customer related issues, which as a result 
has seen massive customer gains.<nl/>In order to target business class passengers, Ryanair has introduced 
business-friendly ticket facilities which have further driven demand for the carrier, thereby improving profits. 
However, profits in the reported period were offset by the company's decision to enter into a long-term fuel hedge 
contract of $92 per barrel.<nl/>Robust passenger count growth coupled with a busy summer holiday season have 
encouraged the carrier to peg its fiscal 2016 profit expectations in the €940 to €970 million range. The company 
also expects more than 100 million passengers in the fiscal.<nl/>Ryanair is also eyeing the transatlantic route with 
extremely low fares for a one-way trip. If successful in implementing its plans, the company will likely pose 
significant competitive threat to U.S. low-cost carriers like Southwest Airlines Co. LUV[2] and Spirit Airlines. <nl/>To 
support such large-scale expansion, the carrier has placed orders for Boeing 737-800 and Boeing 737-Max 200 
aircraft for delivery between 2014 and 2023. The new fleet size will not only help meet escalated travel demand but 
will also boost operating margins, going forward.<nl/>On the other hand, premium European carriers like Deutsche 
Lufthansa Aktiengesellschaft DLAKY[3] and Air France-KLM SA AFLYY[4] reported 106 million and 87.4 million 
passengers, respectively, in 2014. However, both the carriers reported loss of €732 million and €185 million, 
respectively, for the same period. Sluggish economic growth coupled with continuous strikes by pilots has hurt 
profits and passenger gain for both the carriers.<nl/>Ryanair - which currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) 
- has been maintaining its strong performance over the last 30 years, surpassing most European carriers. Hence, 
we believe that Ryanair is poised to gain significantly from higher travel demand, enhanced customer friendly 
policies, attractive fares, increasing capacity and transatlantic route addition across the U.S. and European 
region.<nl/>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best

Ireland to sell Aer Lingus stake to IAG

May 27, 2015( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> International 
Consolidated Airlines Group has cleared a major hurdle in its bid to acquire Aer Lingus after the Irish government 
agreed to sell its 25-percent stake. 
The deal now requires support from rival Ryanair. The government in Dublin has paved the way for a formal bid for 
Aer Lingus by International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) after agreeing to sell its 25-percent stake to the 
owner of airlines British Airways and Iberia.<nl/> After a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, transport minister Paschal 
Donohoe said "extremely important changes" in IAG's previous offer had led to the government's decision.<nl/> 
Under the deal, IAG offers Aer Lingus shareholders 2.55 euros a share - 2.50 euros plus a 0.05 euros dividend - 
valuing the airline at 1.36 billion euros ($1.7 billion).<nl/> "Acquiring Aer Lingus would add a fourth competitive, 
cost-effective airline to IAG, enabling us to develop our network using Dublin," IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh 
said in a statement.<nl/> The sale of the government's stake now enables IAG to make a formal bid to the Aer 
Lingus' other major shareholder, low-cost carrier Ryanair, which holds a 30-percent stake. Ryanair spokesman 
Robin Kiely told the news agency AFP its board "will consider any offer on its merits, if and when an offer is 
made".<nl/> Major assurances<nl/> The sale has been a hot topic for Dublin, with severe opposition within the 
junior government coalition party, Labour, and from unions who warned about implications for jobs and aviation 
connectivity.<nl/> But late Tuesday night a group of eight Labour lawmakers, who had questioned the deal, backed 
the proposals, saying they were "satisfied" their concerns had been met.<nl/> Dublin said IAG had made 
commitments on the future of the airline, promising to maintain the brand, sustain its existing routes, create new 
jobs and ensure the airline's lucrative landing slots at London's Heathrow airport would not be sold for seven 
years.<nl/> But labor unions reiterated their fears about job losses and deteriorating working conditions after 
restructuring, saying they would oppose the sale if their concerns were not addressed.<nl/> Ireland's largest public 
sector trade union IMPACT said the takeover would be "bad for jobs, for Aer Lingus workers and for Ireland's 
connectivity and economic development".<nl/> "The interests of IAG shareholders will always trump the interests of 
the Irish economy and the Irish travelling public," the union said in a statement.<nl/> The leader of the opposition 
Sinn Fein party, Gerry Adams, said earlier on Tuesday that IAG's concessions would be "merely a stay of 
execution" on the airline's valuable Heathrow slots.<nl/> Ireland's ruling coalition will put the decision to a vote in 
parliament on Wednesday, while the European Commission will have to assess the takeover on competition 
grounds later on.<nl/> uhe/pad (Reuters, AFP, dpa)<nl/>

May 27, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Spirit Airlines 
SAVE[1] plans to flag off non-stop flights between Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and Oakland 
International Airport (OAK), starting Nov 12, 2015. Under this latest plan, the company will operate one morning and 
one evening non-stop flight on a daily basis.<nl/>With the launch of this service, travelers from Los Angeles will 
able to save time by skipping the four-hour road journey to San Francisco. 
Moreover, passengers will benefit from Spirit Airlines' affordable ticket rates, thereby increasing air traffic and load 
factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) for the carrier. Furthermore, the new offering will open up more 
travel options during a busy holiday season.<nl/>Interestingly, Spirit Airlines charges 40% lower ticket rates as 
compared to other carriers. Even after considering value-added services, the ticket prices have been kept at a 
significant 35% discounted rate. This largely attracts budget-conscious passengers who can avail flight services to 
their favorite destinations at such reasonable costs.<nl/>Moreover, the company's Ultra-Low Bare Fares (TM) 
program and the Frill Control (TM) service allow passengers to pay for only those services that they require.<nl/>In 
the first quarter of 2015, Spirit Airlines came up with strong financial numbers. Operating revenues surged a 
significant 12.6% year over year while adjusted net income grew 85%. Lower fuel costs and 22.1% growth in 
Revenue Passenger Miles (RPM) or air traffic have supported the upside. The company also exited the reported 
quarter with 70 flights, up 25% year over year.<nl/>Hence, we believe that launch of such new services coupled 
with increased number of carriers under its belt will continue to drive profits for the company going 
forward.<nl/>Spirit Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).<nl/>Stocks to Consider<nl/>Better-ranked 
stocks in the same industry include Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[2], SkyWest Inc. SKYW[3] and JetBlue Airways

May 27, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> There were quite a 
few updates last week from companies in the airline industry. However, all that was overshadowed by the airline 
sell-off that reflected dwindling investor confidence. The airline industry, which has had an incredibly good run over 
the past couple of years, tumbled significantly last Wednesday.<nl/>
The trigger was Southwest Airlines' LUV[1] announcement at the Wolfe research global transportation conference 
that it plans to increase its capacity in the band of 7% to 8% in 2015 as opposed to the earlier projection of a 7% 
increase.<nl/>Southwest's projection caused panic among investors who feared that the capacity expansion would 
lead to an oversupplied market even as fuel costs continue to be weak. The capacity additions could further result 
in a possible price war between legacy and low-cost airlines.<nl/>Meanwhile, American Airlines Group's AAL[2] 
CEO Doug Parker stated that the carrier intends to compete aggressively against the capacity expansion and will 
not lose customers on pricing grounds. However, some market watchers have called the selloff, which caused a 
loss of approximately $10 billion in market value last Wednesday, a mere overreaction.<nl/>Apart from this, airline 
behemoth Delta Air Lines DAL[3] was in the headlines owing to its plans for expansion in Brazil. Not falling behind, 
Southwest Airlines, in keeping with its expansion initiatives, announced a new non-stop service from the Ronald 
Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) to Orlando, FL, effective Nov 1, 2015.<nl/>According to data released 
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, average airfares in the U.S. for the month of April decreased 1.3% over Mar 
2015. The April figure was also down 7.5% on a year-over-year basis.<nl/>European low-cost carrier Ryanair 
Holdings plc RYAAY[4] performed very well in fiscal 2015 (ended Mar 31, 2015). The annual net profit of this 
Ireland-based budget airline jumped 66% on a year-over-over basis on the back of increased revenues and low 
costs. Moreover, the carrier, which is seeing good times thanks to its customer friendly 'Always Getting Better 
(AGB)' scheme, presented a rosy outlook for fiscal 2016. <nl/>Overall, it was a bearish week for the sector. Major 
airline stocks plummeted in the wake of the airline sell-off. The upward movement of oil prices added to the woes. 
In view of this bearish sentiment, the NYSE ARCA Airline index declined 3.4% over the past week.<nl/> (Read the 
last Airline Stock Roundup for May 20, 2015[5]) <nl/>Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories <nl/>1. 
Share prices of major airline stocks including Southwest Airlines, United Continental Holdings UAL[6] and American 
Airlines plummeted following the news that Southwest Airlines intends to increase its capacity in the range of 7% to 
8% in 2015 as opposed to the earlier projection of a 7% increase.<nl/>Investors were clearly concerned that airline 
capacity growth at a rate higher than the U.S. GDP would lead to an oversupplied market. With major airline stocks

Blog
plummeting, the recently launched airline ETF - U.S. Global Jets ETF - also lost value (read more: Air Stocks and 
ETF Plunge[7]).<nl/>2. Delta Air Lines, which is constantly looking to expand its operations, filed for regulatory 
approval to connect Orlando, FL and Sao Paulo, Brazil. Delta intends to introduce non-stop flights on the route 
effective Dec 19, 2015 following the approval. Delta's agreement with Brazilian carrier GOL Linhas Aereas 
Inteligentes GOL[8] should pay off well in this regard (read more: Delta to Expand in Brazilian Skies, Connect 
Orlando-Sao Paulo[9] ).<nl/>3. In a bid to expand its operations and improve customer convenience, Southwest 
Airlines announced that it intends to boost its service in Florida. In line with this objective, the carrier intends to 
introduce a non-stop flight on a daily basis on the DCA- Orlando route from Nov 2015 (read more: Southwest 
Airlines to Boost Service in Florida[10])<nl/> 4. Data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggest that 
average airfares in the U.S. for Apr 2015 declined 7.5% on a year-over-year basis. Soft oil prices over the period 
and increased competition were primarily responsible for the decline. The figure was down 1.3% from Mar 2015 on 
a seasonally adjusted basis, once again reflecting the brunt of soft oil prices (read more: Airline Fares Decline in 
April, Soft Oil Prices Hold Key[11]).<nl/>5. Ryanair Holdings reported robust financial and operating numbers with 
net profit for fiscal 2015 up 66% year over year at €867 million. Moreover, load factor increased 500 basis points to 
88% while air traffic for the year jumped 11% to 90.6 million. The strong performance of Ryanair was mainly buoyed 
by lower fuel prices, attractive fares, continuous route expansion, allocated seating and extra carry-on luggage 
facilities.<nl/>Moreover, the carrier has launched the AGB program which has drawn massive number of new 
customers to Ryanair. In order to target business class passengers, Ryanair has launched business friendly air 
ticket facilities which have further driven demand for the carrier, thus ramping up profits. However, profit for the 
reported period was offset by the company's decision to enter into a long-term fuel hedge contract of $92 per 
barrel.<nl/>Robust passenger growth coupled with the onset of one of the busiest summer holiday seasons ever 
has encouraged the carrier to expect profits for fiscal 2016 in the range of €940 million to €970 million. The 
company also plans to carry more than 100 million passengers for the first time in fiscal 2016.<nl/>Performance

>As the chart above suggests, all airline stocks traded in the red over the past week, due to the major selloff in the 
space. Shares of American Airlines Group depreciated the most, losing 15.67% over the past week. Furthermore, 
most of the stocks shed value over the last six months. JetBlue Airways JBLU[12] was a notable exception having 
gained appreciably (33.70%) over the six-month period.<nl/>What's Next in the Airline Biz?<nl/>With the recent 
airline sell-off on capacity and pricing worries deemed more of an overreaction, we expect the dust to settle soon. 
With nothing major lined up at the moment, stay tuned for usual news updates in the space. Focus, in particular, will 
remain on the price movement of airline stocks, given the volatile nature of oil prices lately.<nl/>Want the latest

May 26, 2015( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ;<nl/> Budget airline 
tickets aren't exactly expensive right now thanks to low oil prices, but Ryanair thinks the cost of flying could fall even 
further.<nl/> Irish no-frills airline Ryanair reported its full-year results this morning[1], which revealed a 12% jump in 
revenue to €5.65 billion (£4 billion, $6.16 billion) and a 66% rise in profit after tax to €867 million (£613 million, $946 
million).<nl/>
 But it warned investors not to expect a similar rise next year, due to competition from rivals on ticket prices.<nl/> 
Here's Ryanair (emphasis ours): <nl/> While our traffic growth this year will be strong, (up 10%), it would be foolish 
not to expect some irrational pricing response from competitors who cannot compete with our lowest costs and 
fares. Ryanair will remain vigorously 'load factor active/price passive'. Therefore, even with the benefit of lower oil, 
aircraft and financing costs we may suffer periods of fare/yield weakness especially during the H2 winter 
season.<nl/> What that basically means is that Ryanair plans to focus on filling its planes — measured by load 
factor — to reap benefits from efficiency, rather than cutting ticket prices to attract more customers. <nl/> But if 
rivals do just that, it could hurt Ryanair's yield — a measure of revenue per customer, per mile flown — as it's 
forced to either trim prices or sees customer numbers fall. <nl/> If all this were to happen, it would be good news for 
consumers, as airlines would be offering cheaper seats in a bid to win business.<nl/> Ryanair, which celebrates its 
30th birthday in July, has itself upped competition with its main European rival, easyJet, by focusing on customer 
service, something it was once notorious for being bad at. Ryanair has made changes including allowing customers 
to select seats at check-in and take an extra piece of hand luggage on board for free.<nl/> The company praised its 
"Always Getting Better" transformation plan for helping boost customer numbers by 11% to 90.6 million in the year. 
This is what boosted revenue and profits, along with cheap oil. <nl/> A drop in oil prices cut costs by 5% last year, 
but this is a smaller benefit than at other airlines. Ryanair buys 90% of its fuel well in advance through "hedging" 
agreements to guard against a jump in price. What this means is it agrees a price to buy the fuel many months 
before the actual deal is done. This protects the company from any sharp and unexpected price jumps.<nl/> This 
practice will also pin back growth next year as oil is hedged at $92 (£59) a barrel, well above its current price of 
around $65 (£42) a barrel.<nl/>Aer Lingus battle<nl/>Ryanair also used its results to attack the UK's Competition 
and Markets Authority (CMA). The watchdog has ordered Ryanair to sell its 29.8% stake in rival Irish airline Aer 
Lingus. The CMA argues the stake is anti-competitive and also puts off potential bidders for Aer Lingus.<nl/> British 
Airways owner IAG has since been bidding for Aer Lingus[2], but an appeal by Ryanair to have its sell order revoke 
in light of the buyer interest was rejected. Ryanair said today: "We believe the CMA will be totally discredited if they 
Ryanair is predicting an 'irrational' airline price war that could be great for customers
do not reverse this manifestly erroneous ruling."<nl/> The company added: "In the meantime our approach to the 
IAG offer remains unchanged. The Board of Ryanair will consider any offer (should we receive one) from IAG on its 
merits, if or when it is received." IAG and Aer Lingus are negotiating.<nl/>NOW WATCH: Forget the Apple Watch

to the end of March rose 66 per cent to €867m (£614m; $948m), slightly ahead of analysts' expectations, reports 
The BBC[1].<nl/>
 The airline's 'Always Getting Better' customer experience programme had attracted 'millions of new customers to 
Ryanair', chief executive Michael O'Leary said.<nl/> Falling oil prices also reduced operating costs.<nl/> 'Our AGB 
programme is transforming our customer experience, our service, and the way we listen and respond to our 
customers,' 
Mr 
O'Leary 
said.<nl/> 
'We

cent to more than €5.6bn.<nl/> To cope with rising demand, Ryanair said it had ordered 183 Boeing 737-800 planes 
for delivery from 2014-18, and 200 Boeing 737 Max 200s from 2019-2023.<nl/> The new aircraft will be cheaper to 
finance and operate, with engines 18% more efficient than their predecessors, the company said.<nl/> Much of the 
growth in passenger numbers is being driven by its new Business Plus and Family Extra services, it added.<nl/> [

May 26, 2015( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Irish no-frills carrier 
Ryanair has reported a strong increase in profit for the fiscal year to March. 
The airline said improved results were attributable to better customer service leading to higher passenger numbers. 
Ryanair reported Tuesday its profit after tax soared to 867 million euros ($948 million) in the fiscal year to March, 
marking a 66-percent increase in bottom-line earnings year on year.<nl/> Europe's largest airline by passenger 
numbers saw the volume of its clients rise by 11 percent to 90 million, hitting a much higher level than the 4 percent 
penciled in at the start of the fiscal year.<nl/> Executives said a big chunk of the full-year growth was attributable to 
its Always Getting Better program aimed at turning round Ryanair's reputation for poor customer service.<nl/> 
Tailor-made offers<nl/> "Always Getting Better is the key, it has been very well received," finance chief Neil 
Sorahan said in an interview.<nl/> The program has introduced lower fees, flexible tickets for business travelers 
and a move away from small regional airports.<nl/> The airline once again declined to provide any details on 
whether it planned to accept an offer by British Airways owner IAG for its 30-percent stake in Aer Lingus. "The 
board of Ryanair will consider any offer from IAG on its merits, if or when it is received," the company said in a 
statement.<nl/> hg/pad (dpa, Reuters)<nl/>

p3[1]<nl/>Podcast: Play in new window[2] | Download[3]<nl/><nl/>Today's interview is with Michael O'Leary, Chief 
Executive of Ryanair[4], a European low-cost airline, headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. 
Ryanair is also the largest European airline by scheduled passengers carried and also the busiest international 
airline by passenger numbers.[5] Michael joins me today after he responded to a recent article I wrote (Does 
Michael O'Leary Really Care About Ryanair's Customers, Or Is He Just Being Pragmatic?[6]) but also to talk about 
humility, Herb Kelleher[7], bourbon and starting to listening to and being nicer to customers.<nl/> This interview 
follows on from my recent interview: Customer feedback is the most effective way of improving the financial 
performance of a business - Interview with Guy Letts of CustomerSure[8] - and is number 144 in the series of 
interviews[9] with authors and business leaders that are doing great things, helping businesses innovate and 
delivering great service and experience to their customers.<nl/> Highlights of my interview with 
Michael:<nl/>Ryanair is the world's largest international airline, Europe's largest low cost carrier and Europe's 
version of the US' Southwest Airlines[10]. Southwest was developed by an Irish visionary called Herb Kelleher[11]. 
In response to a recent post on my Forbes.com column: Does Michael O'Leary Really Care About Ryanair's 
Customers, Or Is He Just Being Pragmatic?[12] - Michael sent me a letter. In the letter, Michael wrote saying 'I am 
the only airline Chief Executive that really cares about my customers which is why I have spent 28 years driving 
down the cost of flying in Europe, this year Ryanair will carry over 100m passengers and save those passengers 
more than €10n compared to the average airfares being charged by our competitors in Europe'. Airlines have a 
terrible image for customer service. Many airlines say that they care about customers and service but, in fact, all 
they are doing is increasing the cost of air travel, through things like fuel charges and prices. Ryanair has been 
actively fighting against that and driving down prices across the board. But, whilst Ryanair has been focusing on 
driving down the price over the last 20+ years as a way of getting big and competitive, we now realise that we need 
to do more than offer customers the lowest price in every market. Despite low prices working very well, some 
customers didn't like what we were doing i.e. free seating or charging for an additional cabin bag so we have 
changed that and are embarking on a series of other changes to change/remove the things that our customers don't 
like. So, we have decided to listen to our customers and make changes where it doesn't impact on our cost base. A 
couple of particularly high growth changes we have made are catering for business travelers and families traveling 
A degree of humility always succeeds in business - Interview with Michael O'Leary of Ryanair
with children. It's been very easy for our competitors to slag us off for being 'cheap and nasty'. However, there has 
been an element of our service over the last few years that has been 'cheap and nasty' and 'that's my mistake'. A 
degree of humility always succeeds in business. It's written somewhere that Michael studied SouthWest Airlines[13] 
and their low-cost and service approach a number of years ago. Michael did go drinking with Herb Kelleher but, 
unfortunately, doesn't remember much after 8pm…..Herb was too much of a bourbon drinker for Michael! Herb, 
apparently, continued on drinking til 2am. Ryanair were the first airline in Europe to replicate the Southwest Airlines 
business model. But, Southwest is no longer the lowest cost airline in the US. Ryanair, on the other hand, is staying 
true to the original Southwest model of being the lowest cost carrier, offering the lowest prices in every market. In 
fact, Ryanair is now starting to emulate the original Southwest maxim 'Low fares and fun'. The new changes have 
been a spectacularly successful learning experience for Ryanair over the last 12 months and they are seeing it 
reflected in their business results too. 'If I had known that being nicer to my customers was going to be so good for 
business, I'd have done it years ago'. 99.9% of passengers when they start looking for flights start with the question: 
'What's the lowest fare?' But, they don't want low prices and unresponsive customer service. So, Ryanair's promise 
now is to offer it's customers the lowest fares in every market but they will also attend to their needs. They are now 
in Year 2 of their 'Always Be Getting Better' programme and this year they have introduced: a new US website - 
with $ pricing ...okings, a new Customer Charter, reduced airport and sports Fees, the introduction of a new native 
mobile app as well as a new GDS deal with SABRE. Check out Ryanair's new Customer Charter[14]. Still to come 
this year is a new Fare Comparison (against all competitors - a world first) ...old a Fare' Feature (coming in Sept), 
an improved Personalised Website (coming in Oct) and new A/C Interiors, Uniforms ...nus (coming in Nov). A set of 
low-cost transatlantic routes is on the cards but is probably 4-5 years away or until the availability and valuation of 
new long haul aircraft improves. Michael's shameless plug is for what he has learned in the last 12 months and that 
is humility. He says about that that it's very difficult for someone who is Irish to be humble. We generally believe 
that we walk on water. We have to continuously learn from the mistakes that we, and I, make. The key mistake that 
I have made in recent years is not listening to our customers and that is not a mistake I am going to repeat 
again.<nl/>About Michael (this bio (below) was taken from Michael's bio on Ryanair's corporate investor page[15] - 
I'm not kidding - although it now seems to have been updated but I like this one better)<nl/> Born, at Christmas, in a 
stable in 1961, he was a boy genius, who excelled both academically and in sports. Having represented Ireland at 
bog snorkelling and flower arranging, he graduated from Trinity College in Dublin as soon as they could get rid of 
him. He became another boring KPMG accountant until divine inspiration sentenced him to lifelong servitude in the 
airline business, as he is manifestly unsuitable for employment in any properly functioning industry.<nl/> Despite his 
best efforts, Ryanair is Europe's favourite airline carrying over 89m customers this year at Europe's lowest fares 
(saving them over €10 billion annually), with great customer service including the most on-time flights of any major 
airline. Ryanair operates more than 1,600 low fare routes from 71 bases across 30 countries, connecting 183 
destinations with a fleet of 300 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Ryanair has recently placed orders for up to 380 new 
Boeing 737 aircraft, which should allow it to double in size to carry over 150m customers annually by 2024. Ryanair 
currently employs a team of 9,500 leading aviation professionals each of whom are dedicated to extending 
Ryanair's industry leading 30-year safety record.<nl/> Bearing a remarkable resemblance to George Clooney's 
younger brother, it is widely reported that most women find him (sadly) resistible!!<nl/> Check out Ryanair's

May 22, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Low-cost carrier 
Southwest Airlines Co. LUV[1] has announced a new non-stop service from the Ronald Reagan Washington 
National Airport (DCA) to Orlando, FL, effective Nov 1, 2015. The move reflects the company's efforts to expand 
and improve customer convenience. 
Following the commencement of the service, Orlando will become the third city in Florida to be connected with DCA 
under the airline's coverage.<nl/>The introductory one-way fare for the new daily non-stop service has been kept 
reasonably low at $59. DCA represents a busy hub of Southwest Airlines and along with the new service to 
Orlando, the carrier will offer non-stop flights to 17 destinations from the airport.<nl/>In keeping with its efforts to 
bolster its service to Florida, Southwest Airlines also announced that it will operate two flights a day connecting Ft. 
Lauderdale and Austin, TX from Nov 1, 2015. The increase in the number of flights on the existing route is primarily 
aimed at enhanced customer convenience.<nl/>Apart from the expansion initiatives, this Dallas-based carrier was 
also in news this week when it announced its intention to expand capacity by 7% to 8% in 2015. Only a month ago, 
the company had increased its capacity growth outlook to 7%.<nl/>News about the rise in capacity growth outlook 
sparked a sell-off in the airline space with many carriers including Southwest Airlines nose diving on concerns that 
growth might outpace travel demand. This could result in lower fares and thinner profit margins. This is because 
cheap fuel is encouraging carriers to increase the number of seats at current fares, hurting the competitive 
discipline that has helped carriers earn huge profits in the past. The capacity additions could result in a possible 
price war between legacy and low-cost airlines.<nl/>Investors are clearly concerned that airline capacity growth at a 
rate higher than the U.S. GDP would lead to an oversupplied market. This anticipation was primarily reflected in the 
recent sell-off.<nl/>Zacks Rank<nl/>Southwest Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the 
airline space include Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[2], SkyWest Inc. SKYW[3] and JetBlue Airways JBLU[4]. Ryanair 
and SkyWest sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while JetBlue carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).<nl/>Want the latest

United Continental Holdings (UAL) Crumbles: Stocks Slumps by 10.3% - Tale

May 21, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> United Continental 
Holdings, Inc. (UAL[1]) saw a big move in the last trading session, as the company's shares fell by over 10% on the 
day. 
The move came on pretty good volume too with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This 
continues the recent trend for UAL, as the stock is now down over 14% in the past one-month time frame.<nl/><nl/> 
This slump shouldn't be too much of a surprise to investors, as the company, which provides engineering and 
manufacturing products and services, has seen 7 negative revisions in the past few weeks and its current year 
earnings consensus has also moved lower over the last 30 days. This suggests there may be more trouble down 
the road. So make sure to keep an eye on this stock going forward to see if this recent slump will continue, as the 
earnings picture definitely suggests that this might be the case.<nl/><nl/> UAL currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 
(Hold) while its Earnings ESP[2] is negative.<nl/><nl/> Investors interested in the Transportation industry may 
consider a better-ranked stock like Ryanair Holdings plc ( RYAAY[3]), carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong 
Buy).<nl/><nl/> Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7

May 19, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> In sync with its 
Latin American expansion, low-cost carrier JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU[1] has decided to start daily flight service 
from two important cities in Florida - Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL) and Orlando 
International Airport (MCO) - to Mexico City's Benito Juarez International Airport.<nl/>
JetBlue will run flights beginning Oct 1, 2015 from these two cities at promotional fares starting at $99 for a one-way 
trip to Mexico City.<nl/>The company has decided to serve Airbus A320 in both routes. Flyers will enjoy more leg 
space, free unlimited snacks and soft drinks. Moreover, passengers travelling to Latin America and the Caribbean 
will be offered free first-run Hollywood movies while on board.<nl/>The inclusion of Mexico City marks the carrier's 
second destination in this country and 35th in the Latin American and Caribbean region.<nl/>We note that Mexico 
City is fast growing as a hot tourist spot, attracting tourists with its large number of museums. Moreover, Centro 
Histórico (in Mexico City), the largest plaza in Latin America, serves as a popular tourist spot. On the other hand, 
travelers from Mexico City can now fly to Florida among other cities, to visit Ft. Lauderdale's sandy beaches and 
Orlando's amusement park. Naturally, connecting Mexico City with important cities in the U.S. will facilitate easy 
and convenient transportation to these locations.<nl/>A few days back, JetBlue announced its plans to launch 
flights connecting Quito, the capital of Ecuador, with Fort Lauderdale. This service is expected to commence in the 
first quarter of 2016, subject to government approval.<nl/>We believe that increased flight frequency across Latin 
America along with cheaper fares will not only improve options for both U.S. and Latin American travelers but also 
boost passenger revenues for the JetBlue carrier, going forward.<nl/>JetBlue currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 
(Buy). Other favorably placed stocks in this sector include SkyWest Inc. SKYW[2], Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[3] 
and American Railcar Industries, Inc. ARII[4]. All three have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).<nl/>Want the latest

May 18, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> In line with its 
network expansion plans, low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co. LUV[1] will extend its services from Houston's 
Hobby Airport to eight international locations by 2015-end.<nl/>
Southwest Airlines also plans to operate a daily flight service between Denver and Puerto Vallarta starting Nov 1, 
2015 subject to regulatory approval by the Mexican government. Moreover, flight service between Orange County 
and Santa Ana will begin from Nov 7, 2015.<nl/>Likewise, Southwest Airlines will also offer flight service every 
Saturday between Baltimore/Washington and Liberia, Costa Rica. The service will commence from Nov 7, 2015, 
subject to foreign governmental approval.<nl/>After operating for several decades within the U.S. market, 
Southwest Airlines initiated its international service in Jul 2014 with flights to Aruba, Bahamas and Jamaica in the 
Caribbean. Moreover, the successful integration of AirTran will further boost the carrier's international 
presence.<nl/>Recently, Southwest Airlines announced impressive traffic data for Apr 2015. Air traffic, measured in 
revenue passenger miles (RPMs), was up 8.6% year over year to 9.9 billion. Capacity (available seat miles or 
ASMs) of this Dallas, TX-based low-cost carrier increased 6.7% to 11.9 billion.<nl/>Hence, we believe that 
increased flight frequencies coupled with low fares will not only enhance travel options for travellers but also boost 
passenger revenues for Southwest Airlines.<nl/>Stocks to Consider<nl/>Southwest Airlines currently carries a 
Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some well-ranked stocks in the same space are JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU[2], SkyWest 
Inc. SKYW[3] and Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[4]. SkyWest and Ryanair sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy),

May 15, 2015( Mark My Words: http://www.markborkowski.co.uk Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Pondering the 1980s 
Stewart Lee observed that culture itself seemed to hate Thatcher. Musicians hated Thatcher. Comedians hated 
Thatcher. Writers hated Thatcher. There were even aliens from the future in 2000AD comic strips who hated 
Thatcher. 
And yet she still managed to get elected. Three times.<nl/> On May 8th the left were again confronted by the gap 
between the professed beliefs of the cultural mood and ballot box choices. For the future-junkies of the PR world 
there are a number of lessons to be gleaned from the political class's failure to read the crowd. While Cameron's 
critics may not be the vituperative Maggie bashers of yesteryear Lionel Shriver[1] writes of the persistence of scorn 
towards the blue voter. Picking up on a certain strand of Guardianista contempt for those who vote according to 
their tax band, Shriver is perhaps writing with a North London type in mind. But it's a point that intersects more 
broadly with the shock felt by the left. Although social media was not singularly owned by Labour -UKIP and other 
right wing groups thrive in the Us Vs Them combat of twitter and online forums- it did function as an echo chamber 
that reinforced confidence and blocked out those to the right of centre who were unmoved by Miliband.<nl/> The 
case of the Tories in Shoreditch clothing is not a failure of nerves on the part of the wet centre but the result of 
politics as a whole becoming dominated by PR trickery and brand image. Both Labour and the Conservatives drove 
campaigns that shielded their leaders from themselves. On May 7th our choices were as much aesthetic as 
political: staid stewardship Vs a geeky sexy newness. In this context it was possible to feel affinity towards an 
image while not favouring the policies. Miliband had celebrities and online fandom, Cameron had Tom Conti (which 
partly fitted Miliband's accusation that the Tories want to take Britain back to the 1980s). Labour stood for 
progressive causes, tackling inequality and saving the NHS whereas Crosby-whipped CCHQ was sticking to single 
line: economy, economy, economy.<nl/> The pollsters and pundits were caught out but marketers should recognise 
this split between affinity and actual consumption. You can see it most strongly in the way people talk about which 
airlines they use. In one survey[2] 70% of customers who said they have an affinity with British Airways actually fly 
most regularly with budget airlines. From the perspective of a Ryan Air there is little incentive in improving brand 
affinity with customers who will fly with them anyway due to the cheaper rates. Cameron might be more genteel but 
he has some of Michael O'Leary's blunt realism; no matter what stick he got from the cultural establishment it is 
policies not style that most voters will be contemplating when their pencils hover over ballot paper.<nl/> [ 1]:

carrier that offers free calls, data and texts then charges for other services, is coming to the UK. 
It will be its first international expansion outside the United States.<nl/> The company's British endeavor - which 
launches this summer - is starting with a SIM-only service. The free option will give users 200 minutes, 200 texts 
and 200MB of data. That puts it on par with other basic paid plans.<nl/> Where that deal gets interesting is that 
FreedomPop adds in unlimited free calls and texts to other people on the network and free international calling to 
over 60 countries.<nl/> It's also launching the Jetsetter - a free international roaming data SIM which will offer 
100MB of free high-speed data per month. Initially you'll only be able to use it in the UK, Spain and France, but 
coverage will eventually expand to over 20 countries.<nl/> FreedomPop users in the US can already take 
advantage of free International plans[2] covering 50 countries. It's attempted to upsell customers to unlimited voice, 
text and data plans, and other additions like a security service.<nl/> If you want early access to FreedomPop UK, 
the company is signing up beta users here[3]. You can also sign up for a beta invite to grab a Jetsetter SIM[4].<nl/>

Delivered by Newstex) ;<nl/> One of Europe's leading low-cost airlines, Ryanair, has in recent years received more 
than it's fair share of press coverage and attention. Much of this has come as a result of a number of controversial 
statements from their famously outspoken CEO Michael O'Leary. 
In the past, he has been known to call customers 'stupid' and has mused publicly about whether they should 
'charge customers to go to the toilet' amongst other things[1] as relentlessly pursued a cost leadership 
strategy.<nl/> However, back in 2013 they issued a series of profit warnings after they found themselves being 
consistently outmanoeuvred by one of their main low-cost and European rivals, EasyJet. Following these profit 
warnings, Ryanair and Mr. O'Leary started to change their tune. They started to talk differently about customers and 
publicly resolved to not to do things that 'unnecessarily p*** people off'[2].<nl/> This strategy is starting to really pay 
off as Ryanair has recently announced that:<nl/>They carried 6.7 million passengers in March, up from 5.2 million in 
the same month last year, representing a 28% jump. Their load factor (the airline industry's measure of how full 
planes are) has also jumped over the same period from 80% to 90%. Meanwhile, Ryanair's share price has grown 
by more than 43% over the last year, as profits and passenger numbers have continued growing.<nl/>Ryanair is 
being lauded in many parts for it's new 'be nice to customers' strategy and the positive business results it is 
delivering. Some are going so far as to call this change in strategy: transformational or a 'road to Damascus'[3] 
moment.<nl/> Call me a skeptic but I'm not sure I would go as far as that.<nl/> If you look at some of the major 
changes that they have introduced such as:<nl/>The introduction of a simpler and easier to use website, including a 
price comparison feature; Introduction of fully allocated seat booking; Allowing passengers to take a second small 
item of cabin baggage on board with them; and The introduction of Business Class seats.<nl/>These aren't 
transformational changes. These are pragmatic changes.<nl/> Ryanair isn't turning itself into a 'paean' of customer 
service or customer experience.<nl/> Not yet, anyway.<nl/> Mr O'Leary and Ryanair seem to be taking a very 
pragmatic approach, where they have realised the pursuit of a cost leadership strategy and making the lives of your 
customers a bit easier are not mutually exclusive. In fact, you could argue that all they have done is eliminate some 
of the 'grit'[4] or the little things that have been destroying their customer's experience[5].<nl/> But, despite a series 
of great results, Ryanair may still have some work to do to convince it's customers that it's new 'be nice to 
customers' strategy is for real and is here to stay.<nl/> In a recent Which? customer service survey of 'The 100 best 
and worst companies for customer service'[6] in the UK, Ryanair ranked number 97 out of 100. Although, this is an 
improvement on it's 2013 ranking where it ranked 100, they still rank much lower than firms such as Aldi, Lidl, 
Does Michael O'Leary really care about Ryanair 's customers, or is he just being pragmatic?
Primark, Poundland, Poundstretcher, Flybe, EasyJet and Shoe Zone all of which are pursuing their own cost-
leadership strategy.<nl/> So, all of that leaves me with a question: Does Michael O'Leary really care about 
Ryanair's customers or is he just being pragmatic?<nl/> Only time will tell.<nl/> <nl/> <nl/> <nl/> This post was

Stiff competition prevails among budget carriers

May 12, 2015( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Europe's main 
budget airlines, Ryanair, Air Berlin and easyJet continue to be locked into cut-throat competition. They have 
reported mixed results for the first quarter, but low fuel costs gave a boost across the board. 
For the six months ended March 31, easyJet on Tuesday reported a pretax profit of 7 million pounds (9.7 million 
euros, $10.9 million), which came as a surprise because airlines usually make a loss during the winter season as 
fewer passengers fly.<nl/> However, the good news was eclipsed by the British airline's announcement it was 
facing "tougher business conditions" in its third fiscal quarter, ending June, due to strike-related disruptions that 
would likely result in a dip in underlying revenue.<nl/> The airline's shares dipped more than 8 percent at one point 
on Tuesday.<nl/> EasyJet said its third quarter profit would take a hit from air traffic control strikes in France in 
April, which led to the cancellation of over 600 flights. As a result, revenue per seat in the three-month period would 
be down by 4 percent.<nl/> Industry analysts now expect easyJet's annual profit to be 25 million pounds ($39 
million) lower. Numis analyst Wyn Ellis, for example, told the news agency Reuters that he was cutting his forecast 
for easyJet's full-year pretax profit to 660 million pounds ($1.03 billion) from 691 million pounds.<nl/> Nevertheless, 
easyJet continued to forecast growth in revenue and profit for the full year, as forward bookings were in line with 
last year and as the cost of its fuel bill is likely o shrink by up to 120 million pounds due to lower oil prices.<nl/> "As 
expected the lower oil price has been beneficial for customers, and easyJet will be able to offer its customers even 
better value fares this summer whilst continuing to grow revenue and profit," the airline said in an earnings 
statement.<nl/> The company said it was confident its fares would be competitive against rival operators, as it had 
reduced them to reflect the lower oil price. <nl/> Air Berlin still in the red<nl/> Europe's number three budget airline, 
Germany's Air Berlin, is also planning to reduce fares but is still struggling to rein in costs.<nl/> A major 
restructuring program, launched by the airline's new chief executive Stefan Pichler aims to turn a profit for Air Berlin 
for the first time in more than a decade.<nl/> Air Berlin, which was already forced to sell a 29-percent stake to Abu 
Dhabi's Etihad Airways, has been cutting routes and has changed its revenue management systems, including a 
new fare structure.<nl/> "Because of increased market pressures and special expenditures, current foreseeable 
business development in the second quarter has so far not fulfilled expectations," the airline said when it reported 
first-quarter results on Monday.<nl/> The airline's loss before interest and tax (EBIT) narrowed to 159.9 million 
euros ($178.6 million) in the quarter through March from a loss of 182.8 million a year earlier. But higher interest 
costs and changes in the market value of hedging instruments actually caused its net loss to widen slightly to 210 
million euros from 209.8 million.<nl/> "We understand that we need to continue the systematic re-engineering of our 
company in order to achieve the goals we have set and generate the necessary market momentum," Pichler said in 
a statement.<nl/> The CEO sees Air Berlin just "at the beginning of a long road to recovery."<nl/> Ryanair hikes 
Stiff competition prevails among budget carriers
profit forecast<nl/> Meanwhile, Dublin-based airline, Ryanair, still dominates the European low-budget flights 
market.<nl/> The budget airline pioneer is set to unveil full-year results on May 26, but it has already lifted its 
forecast several times on the back of a rise in passenger numbers and lower fuel prices.<nl/> In January, Ryanair 
said that it was raising its 2014/2015 profit guidance to a range of 840 million euros to 850 million euros from a 
previous estimate of a maximum of 830 million euros.<nl/> In March, the airline even reported a 28-percent rise in 
the number of passengers for the month compared with March 2014.<nl/> However, Ryanair tempered enthusiasm 
by warning that profit growth next year would be "modest" because it was tied into expensive oil hedges for next 
year at $92 a barrel which would limit its gains from the actual lower prices.<nl/> uhe/ng (Reuters, AFP, dpa)<nl/>

Two Hours of Fighting About the Middle East Carriers, and I Still Can't Get

May 04, 2015( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> At last week's CAPA 
conference, the highlight was supposed to be the panel debate between US and Middle East carriers over whether 
Middle East carriers subsidies created an unfair competitive situation. The two hour panel didn't disappoint and was 
very well-moderated. Despite the performance (which you can watch in its entirety here[1]), I still can't get motivated 
to really care that much about this issue. 
There are a lot of technically valid points on both sides, and in the end there isn't going to be a simple answer, even 
though that's exactly how the US carriers are positioning this. Though I'm not in the government, I'd imagine my 
lack of enthusiasm is a sign that others may have trouble rallying as well. And the general public that does get 
energized will almost certainly fall in favor of cheaper fares and more service on Middle East carriers. If that's the 
case, it doesn't bode well for the US carriers.<nl/><nl/>The panel was originally supposed to include Emirates CEO 
Tim Clark as well as IAG chief Willie Walsh, but both backed out. That left us with Will Ris (Government Affairs for 
American), Ben Hirst (Legal for Delta), and Lee Moak (former ALPA, now 'Americans for Fair Skies') on one side. 
On the other side we had Jim Callaghan (Legal for Etihad), Rush O'Keefe (Legal for FedEx), Roger Dow (head of 
US Travel Association), and David Scowsill (head of World Travel ...urism Council).<nl/> A Simple Issue Between 
Governments… That's Anything But<nl/>The opener came from Delta, talking about how this is a very simple case. 
It's all about eliminating market distortions. According to Ben, while it may be 'legitimate economic policy' for the 
UAE and Qatar to support their airlines, 'it results in a distortion of the marketplace and is inconsistent with open 
skies policy in the US.' What does this all mean? The airlines just want the US government to enter into 
consultations with the UAE and Qatar to resolve the dispute. They kept calling it a simple trade dispute and nothing 
more. <nl/> Jim Callaghan from Etihad was next, and he did not pull punches. Jim is a former Ryanair guy, and you 
can see it in him right away. He has that chip on his shoulder from being the little guy fighting the legacies in Europe 
for so many years. And he said this fight is no different than that. It's all about the big airlines, which control more 
than half the capacity in the world, trying to stop the little guys. Jim talked about how Etihad loves America. It buys a 
lot of American-made airplanes. It brings people to the US to spend money. And it puts 25,000 people a month on 
other US carriers when they get here. Poor little Etihad (which is backed with endless funds from its 
government…).<nl/> American tried to smooth things out a bit and walk a very thin tightrope. Will said this isn't 
about Etihad. It's about governments. US 'trade policy is very clear on this; when we have an industry that receives 
massive amounts of money and has unfettered access to the US, we do something about it.' Will went on to say 
that American isn't against subsidies or state ownership. The airline is against opening the doors to the US entirely 
Two Hours of Fighting About the Middle East Carriers, and I Still Can't Get Excited
to airlines that do have the advantage of massive subsidy. <nl/> This was clearly an effort to push back on the 
allegations that airlines all over the world get subsidies and the US carriers don't fight them. The biggest offenders 
(think India or Argentina, for example) don't have open skies agreements. Will noted that since the World Trade 
Organization rules don't apply to air travel, the carriers want to simply apply those principles.<nl/> When You 
Absolutely, Positively Disagree With the Other US Carriers<nl/>Then came the curveball. Looking at the list of 
players here, something might jump out as strange. Why would FedEx be on the other side? It's a US-based 
company, but it doesn't want to stop the big, bad Middle East carriers? No. Rush started off by saying they are used 
to competing against the largest subsidized companies in the world - postal services. So FedEx always wants more 
open skies agreements to give it as much of a fair playing field as it can get. Dubai is important, because FedEx 
has a hub there, and it relies on the open skies agreement between the two countries to fly beyond Dubai to a host 
of other places. It does not want to see that go away.<nl/> Further, Rush explained that if the US carriers want 
WTO principles to apply, then they can't pick and choose. Let's use all the WTO rules, and that includes the 
principle of national treatment. That means the US would have to open up its airspace to cabotage (allowing foreign 
airlines to fly domestically). Anyone here think the US carriers want that? Nope.<nl/> The US carriers adamantly 
stated that they are only talking about passenger service and will ensure that cargo isn't part of the issue. But is 
there any chance that the UAE says 'ok, your cargo carriers can continue to take advantage of open skies while our 
passenger airlines can not'? No friggin' way. This is quite a tangled web and nothing will be spared if it 
escalates.<nl/> Where's the Beef Harm?<nl/>Things just degenerated from there. The US carriers continued to say 
it was an issue for governments to decide. They just want to present the evidence and have the US uphold its trade 
policy. Lee Moak took it even further saying if we can't enforce an international agreement like this, then how we 
can be expected to enforce any of them. Yes, he even brought up the possible Iran nuclear deal as an example. 
Seriously.<nl/> Meanwhile, Etihad said that this is all silly because there hasn't been any harm. And the agreement 
requires harm to take action. The US carriers disagreed, saying that the fundamental basis of the deal was being 
undermined so harm isn't required. Oh, but they say there's been harm. They point to things like JFK to Milan, 
where Emirates flies.<nl/> All the while, the USTA and WTTC kept banging the drum about the importance of job 
creation. Roger Dow said that if the US carriers don't plan to grow, then the US needs to rely on airlines like the gulf 
carriers to increase capacity and meet demand.<nl/> As usual, the product discussion came up. Don't people like to 
fly on the Middle East carriers more? Ben from Delta very quickly noted that in the quarterly IATA surveys, Delta 
comes in similar to or just below Middle East carriers in some areas. But in areas like operational performance, 
Delta is much better. Fine. And Will from American said that while passengers might like super cheap fares and 
good products, that's not how our trade policy works, because it's not commercially sustainable and it's distorting 
the market.<nl/> The Tangled Web<nl/>The inevitable 'hey American, you know you codeshare with Etihad, right?' 
question came up. The tightrope got even thinner. Will said this isn't an issue about any one airline. It's about 
governments. If the service exists, American doesn't want to deny its passengers in say, Albuquerque, the ability to 
get to Abu Dhabi via codeshare. So… that means it doesn't want the service to exist but it'll take advantage of it as 
long as it does.<nl/> Delta said it was best to deal with this subsidy issue before it started working with gulf carriers, 
but of course that completely ignores the fact that Delta is in an immunized joint venture with Alitalia, an airline 
partially owned by Etihad. This went on and on for two hours with both sides defending their positions, digging in 
their heels. <nl/> Escalation in Congress, Deflation in the Public<nl/>Now we have Congress getting involved. More 
than 250 members of Congress signed a letter asking the administration to seek consultations with the UAE and 
Qatar[2].<nl/> Despite all the fireworks, I still can't get excited about this. Do the US carriers have a point about 
subsidies? They sure do. But is it worth taking action? Is the harm potential really there? As I've said before, I can 
see the fifth freedom question being the most important to address at some point, but so far that is an issue on one 
route only. It's hard to get people excited about something that small no matter how insanely large the subsidies 
are, especially when there's a lot of consumer benefit to be had as well. If the government acts, the public generally 
won't like it.<nl/> But with the feds quickly moving to take public comment and now Congress getting into the act, 
we might actually see something happen here. The question is… will it hurt consumers too much for the 
government to consider moving forward? Possibly more importantly, will it hurt our strategic defense operations in 
the area? There are a ton of potential pitfalls in this, and it's not clear that we have enough to gain to make it a 
worthwhile fight… yet. <nl/> [You can watch the entire 2 hour panel discussion here.[3]]<nl/> [Original dog chasing

Apr 30, 2015( IT Pro: http://www.itpro.co.uk Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Chinese hackers are reportedly 
responsible for stealing $5m (£3.25m) from one of Ryanair's bank accounts last week.<nl/>
 The airline makes fuel transactions for its fleet of 400 Boeing 737-800 aircraft in US dollars and believes the money 
may have been stolen from that particular bank account when it was transferring funds for those purposes.<nl/> 
The stolen money was deposited via electronic bank transfer to a Chinese bank, reports from Ireland have 
revealed, but it hasn't been announced who the bank account belongs to or whether the money is still in the 
country.<nl/> Ryanair said in a statement: 'Ryanair confirms that it has investigated a fraudulent electronic transfer 
via a Chinese bank last week. The airline has been working with its banks and the relevant authorities and 
understands that the funds - less than $5m - have now been frozen. The airline expects these funds to be repaid 
shortly, and has taken steps to ensure that this type of transfer cannot recur.'<nl/> The company said it would not 
be able to comment further on the matter, because it is pursuing legal proceedings with the help of the Criminal 
Assets Bureau in Dublin and other recovery organisations in Asia.<nl/> As yet, the funds have not been recovered, 
neither has anyone claimed responsibility for the attacks, or given a reason as to why Ryanair may have been 
targeted.<nl/> China was one of the countries US authorities flagged as a risk to its security[1] back in February.

Ryanair, has had $5 million siphoned from one of its bank accounts. 
It is alleged that Ryanair were hacked by cybercriminals and had the cash illegally transferred to a bank account in 
China.<nl/> Cyber thieves managed to initiate a single fraudulent transaction using a Chinese bank when stealing 
the money from the airline, according to reports. The hacked account held dollars which the Irish company uses for 
fuel purchases.<nl/> In a statement Ryanair said the following:<nl/> 'The airline has been working with its banks 
and the relevant authorities and understands that the funds - less than $5 million - have now been frozen.'<nl/> 'The 
airline expects these funds to be repaid shortly, and has taken steps to ensure that this type of transfer cannot

Ryanair Boeing 737<nl/> Although the sum stolen was relatively small in corporate terms and appears to have been 
tracked and frozen quite quickly, the incident - yet again - highlights the threat posed by cybercrime to today's 
banking and financial systems.<nl/> Legislation to deter cyber theft is only as effective as the means to enforce it. It 
is a relatively new phenomenon that a theft could be committed without the thief having to set foot in the jurisdiction 
from where the asset is stolen.<nl/> If the perpetrators are above the law or reside in a different jurisdiction 
legislation is not an effective deterrent.<nl/> In February, we covered how Moscow based cybersecurity firm 
Kaspersky Lab had uncovered the operations of an international group of cybercriminals who stole up to $1 billion 
from 'over 100 banking and financial institutions in 30 different countries across the world'.<nl/> To date, there 
appears to have been no progress in identifying the hackers demonstrating the comfort and impunity with which 
very savvy cyberthieves can operate.<nl/> Guy Haselmann from Scotiabank has described cyber attacks as the 
'New Cold War.' In his piece 'The Invisible Enemy' he refers to President Obama's recent State of the Union 
address where he described 'foreign cyber threats as a 'national emergency'.'<nl/> Obama said that the 'if the US 
government does not improve cyber defenses, we leave our nation and our economy vulnerable'.<nl/> Haselmann 
goes on to suggest that warfare ideology has moved from the insane doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction 
Europe's Largest Airline Falls Prey to $5 Million Cyber Theft
(MAD) through nuclear weaponry to 'Multilateral Unconstrained Disruption' - MUD.<nl/> 'This unrestricted warfare', 
he says, 'is meant to disrupt societal functioning; to 'poison' information to elevate distrust of all computer 
information.'<nl/> That governments are involved in this type of warfare is beyond dispute. We previously covered 
how a broad spectrum of countries had perpetrated cyberattacks against their rivals.<nl/> The outcomes of such 
attacks, while not on a par with a nuclear holocaust, should not be taken lightly. It is believed that the deployment of 
the Stuxnet virus by the U.S. and Israel against an Iranian nuclear facility almost caused a major environmental 
catastrophe.<nl/> Trojan malware, apparently of Russian origin, was found in on Nasdaq's central servers which 
was capable, according to the NSA, of 'wiping out the entire exchange'. The knock-on effects of such an action 
would likely have led to stock market crashes, recession and possibly depressions and social upheaval across the 
world.<nl/> The new cold war may indeed be one of cyber warfare. If so we can expect an escalation of such 
attacks should relations between Washington and NATO and Russia, Iran and other Middle Eastern nations 
deteriorate further.<nl/> The fact that cyber theft can occur demonstrates the abstract nature of modern currency. 
By manipulating digits on a computer screen and through hacking, wealth can be transferred from one part of the 
world to another and from one bank account to another.<nl/> The means to acquire goods and services is now 
almost entirely determined by an intangible and virtual medium of exchange. This renders cash little better than 
cryptocurrency, although in theory cryptocurrency should not and cannot be printed and electronically created with 
reckless abandon as is happening to the dollar, euro, pound and other paper and electronic currencies today.<nl/> 
The risks posed by cybercrime, cyber warfare and cyberterrorism to this type of monetary system should not be 
underestimated.<nl/> If the system were to become severely compromised or even collapse - through cyberattacks 
or any of the myriad risks to the system that exist today - it is highly likely that in the ensuing panic gold and silver 
buying, prices would surge to levels never seen before.<nl/> That would see gold and silver rise well above the 
inflation adjusted record highs or real record highs above $2,500 per ounce and $150 per ounce.<nl/> Owning 
physical gold in segregated, allocated accounts is essential financial insurance to protect wealth today.<nl/>

and taken to the Persian Gulf port of Bandar Abbas, on the Strait of Hormuz. 34 sailors on board the vessel are 
American, although U.S. officials later said that the ship, bearing the flag of the Marshall Islands, has no American 
sailors on board.<nl/> Iran's FARS news agency said the vessel had been detained 'for trespassing in Iran's 
territorial waters.' The Pentagon said the action was 'provocative.'<nl/> Some 17 million barrels per day - about 30 
percent of all seaborne-traded oil - passed through the Straits of Hormuz in 2013, according to the US Energy

Apr 27, 2015( Mobile Phone Advisor: http://mobilephoneadvise.com Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Mobile network 
EE has provoked anger by presenting a top priority customer support line that allows users clients to jump to the 
front of the queue for a flat rate of 50 pence. <nl/>
 When calling with to EE's customer service line, an automated message now lures callers to move straight with to 
a rep, instead of wait in line. <nl/> In June this year Ofcom called and shamed EE as the UK's most-complained 
mobile network, with 0.12 calls per 1,000 clients. Now the company is asking users whether they wish to spend for 
the benefit. <nl/> The Concern Response effort, which is available to EE's pay regular monthly users, has actually 
angered long-time clients who think all calls must be dealt with equally. <nl/>'A joke'<nl/> @ PhilUK53 tweeted: 
'Idea it was a joke that @ EE were enabling consumers to jump line up for 50p. Do they not think wonderful 
customer service should be a given?';<nl/> @ Gadget_Ry composed: 'EE is just the RyanAir of mobile networks. 
They have presented a 50p 'line jump' charge for their client service calls.';<nl/> The network defended the step 
asserting it had made a heavy investment in customer service, which included bringing call center tasks back to the 
UK. <nl/> 'We have currently committed to returning over 1,000 functions to the UK from overseas call centres, and 
have already opened 2 brand-new UK centres. To add to this and other investments in service we've introduced 
some small charges for specific customer support,' a representative said. <nl/> Would you spend for the extremely 
un-British advantage of jumping to the front of the line? Share your thought and feelings below. <nl/><nl/>Some

Apr 23, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> For Immediate 
Release<nl/> <nl/> Chicago, IL - April 23, 2015 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst 
Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the 
financial markets. 
Stocks recently featured in the blog include the American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL[1]), Alaska Air Group, Inc.

Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst Blog: <nl/> <nl/> Airline Stock Roundup<nl/> <nl/> With first quarter 
2015 earnings yet to take center stage in the airline space, news flow was spare over the past week. Nevertheless, 
American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL[7]) grabbed headlines with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) 
approving its planned operations on the Los Angeles-Mexico City route, replacing Alaska Air Group, Inc. 
(ALK[8]).<nl/> <nl/> Moreover, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, average airfares in the 
U.S. for the month of March decreased 5% over Mar 2014. The March figure was down 1.7% from Feb 2015 on a 
seasonally adjusted basis.<nl/> <nl/> Low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE[9]) was also in the news for its launch of 
non-stop flights to ten new destinations and expanded service to 18 summer routes. Meanwhile, European low-cost 
carrier Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY[10]) announced its intention to launch three new routes from October this 
year.<nl/> <nl/> On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline index gained 2.4% over the past week.<nl/> <nl/> (Read 
the last 'Airline Stock Roundup' here: Delta Q1 Earnings Top, Virgin America Named Top Airline in US[11].)<nl/> 
<nl/> Recap of Most Important Stories of the Last 5 Trading Days<nl/> <nl/> 1. American Airlines Group received 
encouraging news when the DOT approved the request filed by American Airlines and Alaska Air, thus allowing the 
former to take over a route between Los Angeles and Mexico City from the latter. American Airlines intends to start 
operating on the route from June 4, 2015, replacing Alaska Airlines. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL[12]) had also been 
looking to operate flights on the route, operations on which were restricted by the U.S.-Mexico treaty (read more: 
American Airlines to Connect LA-Mexico Instead of Alaska Air[13]).<nl/> <nl/> 2. Data released by the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics suggest that average airfares in the U.S. for March declined 5% on a year-over-year basis. Weak 
oil prices over the period and increased competition contributed to the decline. The March figure was down 1.7% 
from Feb 2015 on a seasonally adjusted basis reflecting weak oil prices.<nl/> <nl/> 3. In a bid to expand further and 
improve customer convenience, Spirit Airlines introduced non-stop flights to ten new destinations and expanded

service to 18 summer routes such as Cleveland, Boston, Denver, Los Angeles, Houston and Chicago.<nl/> <nl/>

US Carriers Continue to Hammer on Middle East Subsidies While Europe Fractures
US Carriers Continue to Hammer on Middle East Subsidies While Europe 
Fractures

Apr 23, 2015( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> I'm sure you've all just 
been dying to get an update on the US-Middle East airline fight, right? There's little to discuss of substance, but if 
you're looking for fireworks, nothing beats what's happening across the Pond. 
The European carriers are really starting to take sides, and you won't be surprised to see which airlines support 
which position.<nl/><nl/>In the US, the fight slowly continues to move forward. Since my last post on this subject, 
the US carriers did get the Departments of State, Transportation, and Commerce to take a deeper look[1] into the 
issue. A public comment period is now open, so feel free to have your say[2] as the government decides whether or 
not to take action.<nl/> Meanwhile, Middle East carriers have been challenging US carriers to show proof of these 
alleged subsidies. The US carriers have now responded. If you feel like wasting an entire weekend, you can sift 
through the more than 1,000 pages of subsidy-proving documents[3] that have now been posted. It's just backing 
documents to support the claims that have already been made and nothing new.<nl/> The numbers may be there, 
but this is still going to be a long, uphill battle for the US carriers. So, let's come back to that down the road. In the 
meantime, take a look at Europe where airlines are starting to take sides. It's getting ugly. The Association for 
European Airlines (AEA)[4] is a trade group representing European carriers not unlike Airlines For America (A4A)[5] 
here in the US.<nl/> The AEA represents legacy carriers big and small within Europe[6]. You won't find easyJet or 
Ryanair as members, but you'll find everything from Air Berlin to British Airways. Or, uh, I should say you used to be 
able to find that.<nl/> Air Berlin just quit the group[7], and nobody should be surprised. Other members of the group, 
notably Air France/KLM and Lufthansa Group, have been hostile toward the gulf carriers and want policymakers to 
tighten the screws, just as the big three in the US are asking. The AEA has generally followed that line of thinking. 
Money-losing Air Berlin, however, almost certainly wouldn't exist if not for the continuous financial injections from 
Etihad, so there's no doubt it supports its big brother. I imagine we'll see the same from Alitalia, which is now 
another Etihad-supported zombie airline. But Air Berlin isn't the first to make this move.<nl/> Last month, British 
Airways and Iberia (jointly owned by IAG) quit the AEA[8]. Among the big 3 in Europe, IAG sees things very 
differently. Willie Walsh, CEO of IAG, has long been a supporter of letting the market decide what lives and what 
dies. And if the European airlines can't compete, then that's their problem. He has impressive results to show for it, 
even turning Iberia into an airline that isn't drowning in a sea of red ink. Recently, Qatar Airways even took a 10 
percent stake in IAG.<nl/> The AEA is falling apart and that's because the airlines in Europe simply don't agree on a 
way forward. In the US, you have that as well but it's quieter. The big three are unified in their feelings that gulf 
carriers need to be restricted, and Southwest is likely ambivalent. The airlines that are most likely to go against the 
US Carriers Continue to Hammer on Middle East Subsidies While Europe Fractures
grain are smaller: JetBlue, Virgin America, and Alaska. In general, those airlines that a) benefit from gulf carrier 
traffic without being hurt by it, or b) are partially owned by a gulf carrier, are going to support open skies for all. 
That's going to create big divides in the airline community, and we already see the battle lines forming.<nl/> [ 1]:

Apr 22, 2015( SourceWire: http://www.sourcewire.com Delivered by Newstex) ;<nl/> Ten simple holiday mistakes 
that will leave you with truly nothing to declare<nl/><nl/>Date: Embargoed 00.01am Wednesday 22nd 
April<nl/><nl/>●Throw away £106*** by getting holiday currency at the airport <nl/>
●Lose £160 by spelling your name wrong on your airline ticket <nl/>●Overweight luggage can add £225 to your 
holiday costs<nl/><nl/>From bulging baggage to the last-minute currency cash dash, Brits can throw away around 
£773* unnecessarily for every trip they take abroad, foreign exchange experts FAIRFX has found.<nl/> <nl/>In fact, 
with the average Brit spending £587.50** while on every trip overseas, travellers are throwing their spending money 
away before even reaching the departure gates. <nl/><nl/>Commenting on the 10 silly ways to make your holiday 
more expensive FAIRFX currency expert Darren Kilner said: 'Most of these mistakes are things we've probably all 
done without thinking, so it's no wonder companies are tempted to rip off travellers when they get the chance. 
Some of these traps are so easy to fall into such as thinking you can just get your travel money at the airport for the 
same price as elsewhere whereas in actual fact it could cost you £106 more.*** Most of us have also probably 
overstuffed our bags and paid the price at the airport. As a currency provider we are all too aware of the pitfalls and 
want to help people enjoy their breaks without getting stung.' <nl/><nl/>Ten silly ways to make a holiday more 
expensive:<nl/><nl/>1: Bag humbug<nl/>Have you ever been in an airport where people aren't desperately re-
packing, or trying to cram big bags into those little cages that show what carry-on luggage you can have? Ignoring 
your baggage allowance is an ever-popular way to ramp up the costs of your trip pointlessly, while everyone else 
gets to see what's in your case and marvel at your holiday smalls.<nl/><nl/>Cases in point:<nl/>British Airways: For 
an extra 23kg bag pay from £36-£40 online and £40-£65 at the airport<nl/>Emirates: For an extra 5kg pay £113 or 
for 
an 
extra 
10kg 
pay 
a 
whopping 
£225<nl/>For 
full 
list 
see: 
http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/2200/Comparing_airline_charges.pdf[1]<nl/><nl/>2: Name shame<nl/>Sloppy form-filling 
when booking your trip could cost you, so make sure you get your names right if you don't want to be hit with an 
unnecessary bill. Most airlines, even the low-costs, are helpful if you've mixed up your 'Stephens' and 'Stevens' but 
it can get tricky if you're booking for a friend who doesn't use their real first name - everyone calls him 'Bill' but his 
passport reveals his parents' preference 'William'. If you're booking flights for a stag or hen party, make sure those 
William's come out of the woodwork before it gets expensive.<nl/><nl/>No more Bills<nl/>Cost of changing name 
on ticket:<nl/>Ryanair: £110 online or £160 at airport or call centre<nl/>easyJet: £35/£40<nl/>For full list see:            
http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/2200/Comparing_airline_charges.pdf[2]<nl/><nl/>3: Rushing Roulette<nl/>The night 
before you travel, pack in a last-minute rush then celebrate with a late glass of wine, before sleeping in for your 
flight. Then it's time to play Rushing Roulette and find out just how you're going to lose a wad of cash. Thanks to 
Wasteful wanderers: How to throw away your holiday spending money before taking off
that extra hour in bed, will you A) try to convince a cabbie to put his foot down? B) take your own car to the airport 
and park in the first available space without checking the vast difference in drive-up versus pre-booked parking fees 
online first? Or - best of all - C) miss the flight altogether? A combination of B and C is the height of travel 
wastefulness and a surefire way of achieving wasteful wanderer status. <nl/><nl/>How much do you pay to 
play?<nl/>Example of airport flight change fees: <nl/>Wizzair: £49 missed departure fee (Passenger must be no 
more than 30 minutes late for the scheduled departure time to qualify)<nl/>BMI regional: BMI's website explains 
that a new ticket must be bought. <nl/>Carpark costs:<nl/>If booking online via Heathrow's own site you can throw 
away £70 by driving up to the airport carpark without pre-booking (total cost £149) or be organised and park in that 
same spot for just £79. (Long Stay Terminal 5 from 1-8 June pre-booking.) If you want to throw even more money 
away, opt for short stay at Sofitel (T5) for £312. <nl/><nl/>4: The cash dash <nl/>Ignoring the need for holiday cash 
until you're at the airport is one of the most popular ways to pointlessly raise the cost of your holiday. Exchange 
rates can be over 10 per cent worse than elsewhere, and that will put a significant £106*** hole in your spending 
money on every £1,000 you change. Almost as bad is using your plastic abroad without checking the fees - many 
cards will have a poor exchange rate, a foreign exchange fee and who knows what other nasties. Check online for 
the best currency deals, or cut the risk and opt for a prepaid currency card which allows you to lock in great 
exchange rates before you travel. <nl/><nl/>How much cash could you splash?<nl/>If you've forgotten to order your 
prepaid currency card in advance, the best case scenario is you realise 24 hours before you go away that you need 
your holiday cash and order online from FAIRFX to get top rates. Go to the high street to not only battle the dreaded 
queues, but pay up to £38.34 extra for the privilege.<nl/>Here's what you'll lose by going to the top high street 
offenders: <nl/><nl/>Natwest: £38.34<nl/>Marks ...encers: £34.22<nl/>Post Office: £31.69<nl/>Last and definitely 
least, leave it to the very last minute and go to Travelex at Heathrow airport and and lose £106*** of your valuable 
holiday money. Some regional airports are even worse offenders where you can pay up to £118 more.<nl/><nl/>5: 
Rush to the crush<nl/>A surefire way to ramp up those holiday costs is to ensure your trip coincides with a major 
event. You might not be invited on to the red carpet at Cannes, but if your 'budget' trip to the south of France 
happens to fall at the same time as the film festival, you'll be competing for airline seats with people whose luggage 
costs more than your car. Hoping for a hotel bargain? Not likely, the whole area is full. Major sporting events and 
the like will also drive up prices, so check before you book.<nl/><nl/>The price of popularity?<nl/>If you want to visit 
Monaco's Formula 1 Grand Prix this year then staying in Nice and travelling into Monaco on the bus or train - for a 
bus fare of around €30 a day - could make the trip less jaw-droppingly pricey. While we'd probably all love to stay in 
Monaco, the price difference of almost £8,000 may convince some of us otherwise: <nl/>Example of hotel room 
price differences***:<nl/>Hotel Novotel Monte Carlo, Monaco 21-24 May 2015 Executive double room £8,533 
<nl/>Novotel Nice Arenas Aeroport, Nice 21-24 May 2015 Executive room £550<nl/>If you want to visit Monaco but 
Formula 1 isn't your thing, then going a month later, staying in the very same room, in the very same hotel will also 
save you almost £8,000:<nl/>Hotel Novotel Monte Carlo, Monaco 18-21 June 2015 Executive double room 
£627<nl/><nl/>6: The best bar none<nl/>The hotel mini bar. Need we say more?<nl/><nl/>Mini cash 
disasters<nl/>In 2014, TripAdvisor revealed the average cost of a club sandwich in a 4 star hotel in Helsinki is: 
$38.16 with peanuts in a 4 star hotel in Oslo costing an average of $15.75<nl/><nl/>7: Wheels of steal<nl/>Ah, car 
hire. Yes, you could get a juicy discount and a great deal by booking online and you could save a small fortune on

trilogue is agreed: the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, otherwise known as OHIM or, to the in-crowd, 
OAMI, is to be re-branded (on which, see last night's Katpost here[2]). The chosen replacement for this 
sesquipedalian [3]monstrosity (47 characters, inclusive of spaces) is to be the nearly-as-sesquipedalian European 
Union Intellectual Property Office (43 characters, inclusive of spaces). For those who love brevity, IP Australia takes 
some beating, but IP EU was never likely to be.<nl/>           http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-
QRlCgiscQsc/VTbMCJ2QnqI/AAAAAAAA5fs/hPf6miAjmrA/s1600/globe.jpgIt's probably too late to persuade 
Europe's finest to change their minds, but this Kat is convinced that his talented readers, many of whom are deeply 
involved in branding and marketing issues, could have come up with something less boringly descriptive and 
certainly less long-winded than "European Union Intellectual Property Office". He therefore invites them to submit 
their improvements. 
This Kat also thinks that it would be fun to design a new logo to represent the deeper meaning of the European 
Union Intellectual Property Office, this being an IP office which (i) is by the seaside, (ii) just can't stop making 
money, (iii) operates in five official languages and (iv) unlike most other IP offices, has nothing to do with the oldest 
and 
most 
expensive

the rebranded office to the IPKat at theipkat@gmail.com[4], ideally as .jpg or .png documents so that he can edit 
them if need be, or at least in a format that doesn't send his computer into spasms or stun it into total inertia. The 
best entries will be posted on this weblog (so can we have an irrevocable non-exclusive licence for that purpose, 
please?) and a small, as yet unspecified prize will be offered for the best entry. Closing date for entries is close of 
play, Sunday 3 May. It might be a pint of Badger at The Old Nick or, if it turns out to be cheaper, a flight to Alicante

Apr 22, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> With first quarter 
2015 earnings yet to take center stage in the airline space, news flow was spare over the past week. Nevertheless, 
American Airlines Group Inc. AAL[1] grabbed headlines with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) 
approving its planned operations on the Los Angeles-Mexico City route, replacing Alaska Air Group, Inc. 
ALK[2].<nl/>Moreover, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, average airfares in the U.S. for 
the month of March decreased 5% over Mar 2014. The March figure was down 1.7% from Feb 2015 on a 
seasonally adjusted basis.<nl/>Low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines SAVE[3] was also in the news for its launch of non-
stop flights to ten new destinations and expanded service to 18 summer routes. Meanwhile, European low-cost 
carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] announced its intention to launch three new routes from October this 
year.<nl/>On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline index gained 2.4% over the past week.<nl/> (Read the last 
'Airline Stock Roundup' here: Delta Q1 Earnings Top, Virgin America Named Top Airline in US[5].)<nl/>Recap of 
Most Important Stories of the Last 5 Trading Days<nl/>1. American Airlines Group received encouraging news 
when the DOT approved the request filed by American Airlines and Alaska Air, thus allowing the former to take over 
a route between Los Angeles and Mexico City from the latter. American Airlines intends to start operating on the 
route from June 4, 2015, replacing Alaska Airlines. Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL[6] had also been looking to operate 
flights on the route, operations on which were restricted by the U.S.-Mexico treaty (read more: American Airlines to 
Connect LA-Mexico Instead of Alaska Air[7]).<nl/>2. Data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggest that 
average airfares in the U.S. for March declined 5% on a year-over-year basis. Weak oil prices over the period and 
increased competition contributed to the decline. The March figure was down 1.7% from Feb 2015 on a seasonally 
adjusted basis reflecting weak oil prices.<nl/>3. In a bid to expand further and improve customer convenience, Spirit 
Airlines introduced non-stop flights to ten new destinations and expanded service to 18 summer routes such as 
Cleveland, Boston, Denver, Los Angeles, Houston and Chicago.<nl/>However, according to the 2015 American 
Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) by customer service, Spirit Airlines secured the lowest score for airlines. 
JetBlue Airways JBLU[8] topped the list according to the survey, which also considered hotels and online travel 
agencies apart from airline companies.<nl/>4. Ryanair Holdings declared, as a part of its winter schedule, that it will 
start three new routes from its base at Copenhagen. The carrier stated that it will operate flights between 
Copenhagen and Alicante, Budapest and Malaga from Oct 2015. Following the new additions, Ryanair will operate 
on twelve routes from Copenhagen starting from the coming winter.<nl/>Performance <nl/>The following table 
shows the price movement of the major airline players over the last 5 trading days and during the last 6 months.

above suggests, quite a few airline stocks gained over the past week. American Airlines Group emerged as the 
biggest gainer with its shares rising 6.56% on the back of the approval gained from the DOT. JetBlue Airways 
witnessed the highest upside (71.54%) over the last six months. <nl/>What's Next in the Airline Biz?<nl/>It will be 
all about earnings in the airline space over the next five trading days. Big names in the space like Southwest 
Airlines Co., American Airlines and United Continental Holdings UAL,[9] the parent company of United Airlines), are 
scheduled to unveil their first quarter 2015 earnings numbers over the said period. We expect investors to keep a 
close eye on the quarterly performance of these key players, along with the business guidance provided by them for

Apr 15, 2015( IT Pro: http://www.itpro.co.uk Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Google's latest algorithm update - focused 
especially on mobile browsing - is being rolled out today, with many organisations waiting with baited breath to see 
whether they will be adversely or positively affected by the changes. <nl/>
 Most successful businesses now rely on search engine optimisation (SEO) strategies to get their websites seen, 
but those strategies themselves always in turn rely on Google's complex algorithms.<nl/> When those change, it 
can mean bad news for many previously thriving sites, and another update for Google's mobile-friendly algorithm is 
indeed on its way. Today, an update, dubbed 'Mobilegeddon', will change 'mobile searches in all languages 
worldwide and will have a significant impact on our search results,' according to Google.<nl/> Maria Mitsostergiou, 
head of search at mobile marketing firm Somo, said: 'Google's upcoming 'mobile friendly' algorithm update - the so-
called Mobilegeddon - is another indication of how important Mobile Search is and will be this year. We regularly 
see Organic Search becoming an increasingly important factor for Paid Search success.'<nl/> Websites that 
anticipated being affected include MI5, Nintendo, Windows Phone, RyanAir and more, with the way Google 
recognises how compatible with mobile devices their sites are changing. Even companies with apps or reactive 
sites may see a drop in rankings - though the full impact may not be seen until anywhere between 72 hours and 
several weeks, experts says. <nl/> 'The incorporation of 'mobile friendliness' as a ranking signal for websites will 
separate companies proactively opting-into mobile versus those that cannot see the benefit and power of their 
mobile presence on SERPs,' Mitsostergiou continued.<nl/> 'This in turn will only benefit the synergy of Organic and 
Paid Search efforts by providing the right results in the right place and at the right time.'<nl/> This article was

Apr 20, 2015( MacRumors.com: http://www.macrumors.com Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Apple Watch will make 
the flying experience more convenient for both casual and frequent flyers, with a number of airlines updating their 
apps for the Apple Watch in recent weeks, or announcing support coming soon, including American Airlines, Delta, 
United Airlines, JetBlue, British Airways, EasyJet, Ryanair, Qantas Airways, Air Canada, WestJet, Emirates and 
Japan Airlines. Notable airlines that have not announced or planned Apple Watch support include Southwest 
Airlines and Virgin Airlines in the United States, and Cologne-based Lufthansa, the largest airline in Europe. As 
more airlines begin updating their apps for the Apple Watch, however, it is likely that others will follow in an effort to 
keep up with their competitors around the world. 
The roundup below provides a closer look at Apple Watch apps for several airlines across the United States, 
Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, France, Ireland, United Arab Emirates and Japan. A handful of other general 
flight-related apps are also listed that provide general flight statuses, notifications, real-time departure and delay 
information and more for an easier traveling experience. United States American Airlines American Airlines for 
Apple Watch provides comprehensive flight information on your wrist, including gate change announcements, an in-
flight map with estimated travel time remaining until arrival, and baggage claim and connection details. You can 
also receive a notification when it's time to leave for the airport and check in to your fight directly from your Apple 
Watch. American Airlines is free on the App Store[1]. Delta Delta Air Lines will also be joining the mix of airline apps 
for Apple Watch in a future update to its current Fly Delta app for iPhone and iPad. Delta for Apple Watch will 
deliver notifications about flights to users ahead of their boarding times, and it will give them access to the boarding 
pass stored on their iPhones directly on the wrist. Delta for Apple Watch will offer flight numbers, gate numbers, 
flight times, and other info. If a flight gets changed, for example, users will get a notification on their Apple Watch. 
There will also be a notification when a flight is approaching a destination city, with information about luggage 
pickup. Fly Delta is free on the App Store[2]. United Airlines United Airlines has not released screenshots or in-
depth details about its Apple Watch plans, but it has confirmed that support for the wrist-worn device is in the works. 
United's app will offer at-a-glance information on upcoming flights, including gate numbers and status, and let users 
view their flight reservations. It will also pull a traveler's boarding pass from the Passbook app, and it's able to alert 
users if flight times or gate numbers change. United Airlines is free on the App Store[3]. JetBlue JetBlue has 
updated its app with Apple Watch support, enabling users to purchase onboard premium offerings from their wrists. 
The new Apple Watch app provides flyers with a Glance flight status, travel countdown and smart mobile boarding 
pass from the Apple Watch. JetBlue is free on the App Store[4] for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. Canada Air 
Canada Air Canada, the largest airline in Canada, recently updated their app with Apple Watch support for viewing

the status of your flights departing within 24 hours, seeing your countdown to boarding time from your Glances, 
getting notifications for checking in and boarding your flight, using Handoff from your Apple Watch to complete your 
check-in and viewing boarding passes from Passbook. Air Canada is free on the App Store[5]. WestJet WestJet, 
the second-largest Canadian airline behind Air Canada, recently updated its app for the Apple Watch to allow users 
to keep track of saved flight statuses and details in Glances, or view a countdown of time remaining until your next 
WestJet flight. WestJet boarding passes saved to Passbook will also be available on Apple Watch. WestJet is free 
on the App Store[6]. United Kingdom British Airways Keep up to date with the latest flight information using British 
Airways for Apple Watch. At a glance, the app allows you to view the status of your next flight, access both 
scheduled and estimated departure times, and view the latest weather at your destination. The app also provides 
up-to-date information about the flight's gate status and provides notifications on your wrist when your gate status 
changes at Heathrow Terminals 3 and 5. British Airways is free on the App Store[7]. EasyJet EasyJet, a low-cost 
airline in the United Kingdom, has also updated their app with Apple Watch support recently, providing personalized 
flight information and real-time views of travel information checked most frequently by passengers. Apple Watch 
users can also tweet and post to Facebook at various stages of their trip directly from the watch face. EasyJet is 
free on the App Store[8]. Australia Qantas Airways Qantas for Apple Watch is designed to eliminate the stress that 
can be associated with the flying experience. The app will provide a range of up-to-the-minute travel information 
and notifications on your Apple Watch including: departure time and gate information, in-air departure and arrival 
time-zone information, transit time information, lounge access eligibility, frequent Flyer login access, baggage 
carousel information (at selected destinations), boarding pass access (via Passbook) and delay or cancellation 
notifications. Qantas Airways is free on the App Store[9]. France Air France Air France for Apple Watch will deliver 
much of the same functionality as the airline's iPhone app, access upcoming reservations, including the ability to 
check if your flight is on time or confirm that you are checked in. You can also view all of your essential trip 
information via Glances, including your gate or departure terminal, your seat and the time remaining before 
boarding, and obtain your boarding pass through Passbook. Air France is free on the App Store[10]. Ireland Ryanair 
Ryanair has pledged support for the Apple Watch when the wrist-worn device becomes available in Ireland. United 
Arab Emirates Emirates While the Apple Watch is not available in United Arab Emirates until later in 2015, the 
airline Emirates recently updated their app with Apple Watch support for a hands-free travel experience. Emirates 
will be the first airline in the Middle East and African region to offer an Apple Watch app, with similar functionality as 
others: review your list of upcoming trips, access real-time flight information, receive notifications and access your 
boarding pass through Passbook. Emirates is free on the App Store[11]. Japan Japan Airlines Japan Airlines has 
developed an Apple Watch app that it will be available when the device launches on April 24. The app will offer 
similar functionality as the other airlines listed above. JAL is free on the App Store[12]. General Apps FlightTrack

Lithuania saw strong growth in inbound tourism in 2014 as visitors travelled to experience a culture rich in history 
and art, the rolling hills of the national parks and UNESCO sites such as the Curonian Spit and Vilnius Old Town. 
Inbound tourism grew by 7.7% in 2014 and having being ranked 3rd in the Lonely Planet's Top 10 destinations to 
visit in 2015, the tourism sector looks set for another healthy year, boosted by excellent flight routes from the UK 
and Lithuania's recent status as the newest member of the Eurozone.<nl/>In line with other Baltic states, inbound 
tourism to Lithuania has risen as the number of local tourists exceeded 1 million and the number of visitor stays 
from foreign tourists rose to 1.3 million. Visitor numbers are increasing heavily from further afield, as news of 
Lithuania's quirky and vibrant charm is attracting high number of visitors from Japan and the USA.<nl/>Visitors from 
the UK are spared the long-haul flight and can experience what Lithuania has to offer with a short flight across the 
North and Baltic Sea. Direct flight access from the UK is superb with flights leaving from London, Edinburgh, Leeds, 
Manchester, Aberdeen, Liverpool, Birmingham, Doncaster and Bristol. Wizzair offer flights to Vilnius while Ryan Air 
operate flights to Vilnius and Kaunas. Less than a three hour flight with either of these carriers will take visitors to a 
treasure trove of natural beauty; Vilnius' baroque old town, Trakai Castle and the Curonian Spit are just a few gems 
waiting to be discovered and part of what makes Lithuania Europe's best kept secret.<nl/>Lithuania's recent move 
to join the Eurozone also holds promise of increasing inbound tourism for 2015 as from 01 January 2015 it became 
easier to implement electronic payments and transactions in the country. The move is the final stage in Lithuania's 
bid to become a fully-fledged European nation, coinciding with the 25th anniversary of Lithuania's independence, a 
campaign which has certainly come full circle with its motto 'Back to Europe'.<nl/>For more information on Lithuania

Apr 15, 2015( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ;<nl/> A number of the 
world's biggest brands are about to be punished by Google's latest update to its search results algorithm — unless 
they quickly make their sites more mobile-friendly.<nl/> The consequences for failing to get with Google's program 
are real: In the last update, eBay lost 80% of its prime rankings[1]. Back in July 2014, Baird Equity analyst Colin 
Sebastian said in a note to investors that changes at Google may have cost eBay around 5 percentage points of 
growth off its gross merchandise volume.<nl/>
 Google announced in February it is making changes to its mobile search algorithm to give "mobile-friendly" sites — 
those with large text, easy-to-click links, or those with responsive design (which means webpages uses the same 
URL whether they are on desktop or mobile, but "respond" according to the screen size of the device) — higher 
rankings in search results. <nl/> Research from mobile marketing company Somo, found brands set to be punished 
under the new update, which becomes effective on April 21, include:<nl/> The official website of the British 
Monarchy David Beckham's official site MI5 The official website for the European Union The Scottish National Party 
Nintendo Windows Phone Versace Next American Apparel RyanAir Channel 4 Kellogg's UK Dyson P...ruises 
RyanAir Clairol UK Cotton Traders Danone Legal and General The Daily Mail<nl/> Websites affected are not just 
limited to this list.<nl/> Somo checked the brands highlighted by the Internet Advertising Bureau UK's recently 
published "Top 250 Mobile Audit"[2] report as still struggling to get to grips with mobile, as well as other high profile 
names like the official David Beckham site and the official website of the British Monarchy. Somo used Google's 
own "Mobile-Friendly Test"[3] to carry out the research (you can check your own site on it too.)<nl/> Here's what 
happens when you test MailOnline.com, for example:<nl/><nl/>MailOnline does have an app, which the site points 
users towards, but nevertheless, it is not deemed mobile-friendly by Google.<nl/> Maria Mitsotergiou, Somo's head 
of search, said: "Google's upcoming 'mobile friendly' algorithm update — the so-called 'Mobilegeddon' — is another 
indication of how important mobile search is and will be this year. We regularly see organic search becoming an 
increasingly important factor for paid search success. The incorporation of 'mobile friendliness' as a ranking signal 
for websites will separate companies proactively opting-into mobile versus those that cannot see the benefit and 
power of their mobile presence on search engine results pages (SERPs.) This in turn will only benefit the synergy of 
organic and paid search efforts by providing the right results in the right place and at the right time.'<nl/> The impact 
of Google's mobile-friendly algorithm is predicted to be huge. Search Engine Land reported Google's Zineb Ait 
Bahajji, who works in the Webmaster Trends team, said it will have more of an impact[4] on Google's search results 
than the previous Google Panda update[5] and the Google Penguin update.[6]<nl/> While Google wouldn't give a 
A bunch of big companies are about to get punished by Google 's latest search algorithm update
percentage for sites and search affected, the company says about 50% of searches are carried out on mobile 
devices.[7]<nl/> And that number is only likely to grow as mobile penetration increases across the globe.<nl/>NOW

Apr 10, 2015( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Disgruntled 
French air traffic controllers and 300,000 French workers[1] effectively ruined the holidays for thousands of Britons 
during the half term week.<nl/> The air traffic workers went on a two-day strike, starting on April 8, after a dispute 
over the retirement age for air traffic controllers being raised from 57 years to 59 years.<nl/>
 The strikes have already caused major chaos across Europe, with many Britons remaining stranded overseas, 
after three of the worst affected airlines had to cancel flights:<nl/> Budget airline easyJet cancelled 579 flights in 
total over the last two days. Low-cost airline Ryanair cancelled just over 500 flights over the last two days. Air 
France said 75% of its flights from Orly airport in Paris are cancelled. However, it said it is operating 50% of 
medium-haul flights to and from Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport. Around 40% of flights to and from cities in the rest 
of France are also operational. It said long-haul Air France flights were affected on Thursday.<nl/> AFP reported 
that by including all airlines into the cancelled flight tally, around 2,000 flights have been cancelled in total[2].<nl/> 
"We can assure our passengers that we are doing everything possible to limit the inconvenience of this strike on 
them," said Roger Rousseau, head of the SNCTA union that represents the striking workers[3], in a 
statement.<nl/><nl/>Many Britons are stranded across Europe due to the industrial action.<nl/> easyJet is operating 
five "rescue" flights[4] today to fetch three parties of schoolchildren from France and bring them back to the 
UK.<nl/> Meanwhile, British families are finding that they are stuck abroad because there are simply no flights back 
to the UK.<nl/> "We have a four-month-old baby and his formula milk has ran out and he is not drinking much of the 
other variety, so I am concerned," said Johanna Booth, from Liverpool, to the BBC[5]. "The support we have 
received from Ryanair has been minimal."<nl/> She is apparently stuck in Barcelona after two Ryanair flights were 
cancelled.<nl/> Ryanair said in a statement[6] to the BBC (emphasis ours):<nl/> We again call on the EU and 
French authorities to act now and prevent thousands of travellers being held to ransom by these French [air traffic 
control] workers.<nl/> Meanwhile, an easyjet spokesperson said in a statement, presented in a video on 
YouTube[7]: <nl/> The unnecessary strike has caused considerable and disproportionate disruption for passengers 
and airlines across Europe.<nl/> But the travelling pain is set to continue as f[8]urther strikes are planned for April 
16 to April 18 and then again between April 29 to May 2[9]. This time, the strikes will coincide with spring school 
holidays in France in May.<nl/> CGT Protests<nl/> Meanwhile, nationwide strikes across France, called by key 
unions like the Communist-backed CGT, kept key tourist destinations closed.<nl/> According to the CGT union, 
300,000 people turned out in marches to protest against the government's austerity measures, including state 
funding cuts and new rules that allow businesses to fire workers more easily.<nl/> Major tourist hot spots, like the

Apr 10, 2015( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> It has been a 
rough few months for Liam Griffin, the CEO of Addison Lee, London's big private-hire taxi firm which is battling 
against the Uber invasion.<nl/> For years, the London taxi market was simple: the famous black Hackney cabs 
were allowed to do street-hail, curbside pickups. 
And Addison Lee — and an endless number of microscopic local competitors — did the private hires. AL's fleet of 
4,800 cars dominated the phone-call booking trade. The company even introduced Britain's first ever ride-booking 
app, which still accounts for 60% of AL's business.<nl/> Then Uber launched in London two years ago, and Addison 
Lee's world got a lot more complicated:<nl/> AL and the black cabs failed in their bid to persuade Transport for 
London to regulate Uber[1] cars as if they were taxis. Carlyle, the private equity group that owns AL, reportedly put 
on hold an £800 million ($1.2 billion) plan to sell the company[2]. The company laid off 90 people in a restructuring 
this year[3]. It currently has about 650 employees.<nl/> But it's not all bad news, CEO Liam Griffin tells Business 
Insider.<nl/> In a lengthy talk recently, he told us that AL is still growing revenues by 7% a year (the company 
currently takes revenues of about £232 million from £320 million in transactions across its cars). Profits are up[4]. 
And AL has a plausible plan to lock in the higher-priced, corporate section of the market that isn't yet penetrated by 
Uber. AL will install free wifi service in all its cars over the next few weeks, the kind of perk that business riders 
prefer. Uber cannot promise that.<nl/> Griffin also has an audacious plan to enter the New York City market — 
which is even more competitive, and even more disrupted by Uber, than London's. <nl/> But first, the context. How 
bad has Uber hit AL?<nl/> "It would be wrong to say Uber is having no impact because it is," Griffin says. "Uber has 
definitely been disruptive."<nl/> Uber appears to be peeling off the under-35s, he says, and the casual part-time 
drivers who want to serve them. That's not a lethal problem for AL, because the company wants to lock in its older, 
more expensive, corporate account business with professional drivers who work five days a week. That's where 
free wifi comes in. Some execs just need it on the ride, and they cannot get that from Uber. Plus, corporate 
customers prefer the level of courtesy, cleanliness and deference that AL drivers are supposed to offer.<nl/> "It's 
about quality of service, we're not competing with the back-street booking services, the yellow flashing light brigade, 
as we call them." (That's a reference to the lights small taxi companies often have in their office windows to attract 
late-night customers.) "You can charge a premium. How much of a premium is open to debate." It's like British 
Airways and Ryanair, he says. "They've both got airplanes with seats on but somehow BA always manages to 
charge more."<nl/> If AL is still growing, why were their layoffs? "We have always refined the employee base. 
We've added a lot of tech over the years," he says.<nl/> This meant fewer staff were needed to answer phones in 
Addison Lee's CEO told us how Uber is hurting his business and what he's doing about it
the control room, which had traditionally been a manual process. Much of that booking is now automated and AL 
has reduced booking time by 25% as a result, he says. And the company is launching a new version of its app in 
the next few weeks.<nl/> That's where the seemingly bonkers plan to launch in New York City comes in.<nl/> AL is 
not actually going to compete with a fleet of cars in Manhattan, it turns out. Instead, AL will license its ride booking 
dashboard to American private hire companies, which want to cut costs and speed up bookings the way AL did. 
Suddenly, the New York plan makes a lot more sense: AL will take a cut of the revenue. <nl/> Before Griffin ended 
our conversation, I asked him about our favourite rumour: AL is allegedly the chosen cab company of certain 
members of the Royal Family when they're travelling incognito around London. Turns out that is probably not 
happening, Griffin says. The company does have the Royal Warrant, which is the seal that allows merchants to say 
they supply the Royal family with goods or services. But "it's more the staff at Buckingham Palace" rather than 
actual royals, he says. <nl/>NOW WATCH: We did the math: Is Uber really cheaper than a taxi? [5]<nl/> [ 1]:

 Easyjet has cancelled nearly 600 flights following the second day of strike action by French air traffic 
controllers.<nl/> The budget airline failed to operate 331 flights after cancelling 248 on Wednesday, but it has 
announced plans to operate five 'rescue' flights on Friday to help passengers who are stranded in European cities 
after Easter breaks.<nl/> The additional flights will run from Luton to Paris, Paris to Barcelona, Barcelona to Luton, 
Gatwick to Madrid, and Marrakech to Gatwick.<nl/> The budget airline cancelled 584 flights - 248 on Wednesday 
and 336 yesterday - after the strike affected large parts of airspace over France.<nl/> Today's extra flights will run 
to and from Gatwick, Luton, Madrid, Paris, Barcelona and Marrakech alongside the 1,436 normally run by easyJet 
on the busy Friday in the Easter break.<nl/> EasyJet disruptions manager Gill Lucas said last night: "The slot 
delays through French airspace haven't really improved.<nl/> "In some cases we've been set for on time departures 
and then we've suddenly had three or four-hour slot delays thrown at us.'<nl/> According the The Independent, 
British Airways has cancelled 26 flights so far, mostly from Heathrow to destinations in France, and Air France is 
encouraging customers to rebook for after the strike has finished, having 118 flights, including 10 to the UK. Ryan 
Air has also cancelled around 558 flights.<nl/> The 48-hour strike,against government cuts, which is being led by 
the SNTCA union, disrupted 2,000 flights both in and out of France yesterday, and even more on Wednesday.<nl/>

Strikes by air traffic controllers in France are expected to ground up to 40 percent of the country's air traffic. 
Flights to other countries including Germany have also been affected. French workers belonging to the SNCTA air 
traffic controllers union have begun strikes on Wednesday that will have widespread implications for air travel in 
France and Europe. Authorities in France said air traffic could be reduced by as much as 40 percent on 
Wednesday, with the strike expected to continue into Thursday.<nl/> The union has called for talks regarding 
working practices and the workers' retirement age.<nl/> Air France said it hoped to operate almost all of its long-
haul flights and would maintain 60 percent of its medium-haul schedule. On short-haul flights operated by its 
subsidiary HOP!, the airline recommended that travelers put off their travel until April 10, with two-thirds of short-
haul flights from Paris's Orly airport set to be canceled and 40 percent set to be cancelled at other airports.<nl/> 
Irish airline Ryanair said in a statement that it had been forced to cancel over 250 flights on Wednesday.<nl/> "We 
sincerely apologize to all customers affected by this unwarranted strike action and we call on the EU and French 
authorities to take measures to prevent any further disruption," the statement read. "It's grossly unfair that 
thousands of European travelers will once again have their travel plans disrupted by the selfish actions of a tiny 
number of French [air traffic control] workers."<nl/> Lufthansa and its low-cost subsidiary German Wings both 
issued statements saying flights to and from France could be affected by the strikes and advised travelers to check 
on their individual flights to see if they were affected. The statements warned that the strikes could have further

Stocks were modestly higher in Tuesday's early going, adding to gains from Monday's upside reversal[1].<nl/>
 The Nasdaq and the S...00 were up 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. The Dow Jones industrial average was also up 
0.2%. Volume was running mixed in the stock market today[2]. Nasdaq trade was tracking higher, but NYSE trade 
was running lower.<nl/> Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY[3]) gapped above its 50-day line and rallied 4% after being 
upgraded to overweight from neutral at JPMorgan Chase. The stock is in a flat base with a 71.89 buy point. 
Ryanair, a discount Irish airline, was recently featured in The New America[4].<nl/> Inphi (NYSE:IPHI[5]) rose 
nearly 4% after Summit Research[6] started coverage with a buy rating and a 24 price target. Santa Clara, Calif.-
based Inphi provides high-speed analog and mixed-signal semiconductor solutions to the communications, data 
center and computing markets. The company has delivered triple-digit earnings growth in recent quarters. The 
stock is in a consolidation with a 21.43 buy point.<nl/> Noah Holdings (NYSE:NOAH[7]), which rose in the past four 
sessions, added 2% to a near four-month high. The lift puts it 12% past a 22.33 buy point from a double-bottom 
base. Noah, a Chinese provider of wealth management[8] services, was featured in a Screen of the Day[9] .<nl/> 
On the downside, Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO[10]) opened higher but reversed to a 1% loss. It's now 3% below a 
78.15 buy point from a cup base that it recently reclaimed after nearly triggering a sell signal on March 26.<nl/> [ 1]:

http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gbOlQfilFig/VSFptYce1kI/AAAAAAAAJ3Y/kO-
X2u1h9G0/s1600/LuthansaShareholding.gifThe adjective "German" evokes mostly positive images in the minds of 
modern consumers: efficient, high-tech, and even lovable. While the first two are well-established parts of German 
renown for engineering, the third is somewhat newer as recent BBC[1] and GfK[2] polls have shown Germany 
cementing its grip as the world's best-loved country. 
In large part Germany's popularity is attributable to excelling in nearly all fields of human endeavor: From selling 
name-brand manufactures ranging from apparel to automobiles; punching above its weight in sports by winning the 
World Cup in 2014 for the fourth time for instance; and generally acting as a good global citizen, Germany excels. 
(Although the Greeks may take exception.)<nl/>Then we come to Lufthansa. The airline industry should fascinate 
IPE scholars for two reasons: First, the industry is truly a globalized one impacted by fuel costs, jetliner acquisitions, 
and international competition. In recent years, I have discussed the emergence of low-cost airlines[3] and Middle 
Eastern carriers[4] alongside mixed fortunes for flag carriers--most notably the crisis-hit Malaysia Airlines[5]. Today, 
unfortunately, the mantle falls to Lufthansa. The deliberate crash of one of its low-cost affiliate's jets by a suicidal 
co-pilot has brought it to worldwide attention. However, like Malaysia Airlines, trouble was already brewing[6] 
beforehand: But Lufthansa has been criticised for its apparent ignorance of co-pilot Andreas Lubitz's previous 
history of severe depression — a problem that worsened on Tuesday when the airline conceded that Lubitz had told 
its pilot training school[7] about his condition in an email. Lufthansa can ill-afford that kind of bad press as safety is 
the cornerstone of its brand. 'They are potentially vulnerable in the short term to the as yet unproven allegation that 
something went wrong in pilot selection and care," says Mr Grossbongardt.<nl/> Even before last week's horror, 
that reputation for reliability had taken a knock. As a result of 15 days of strikes, Lufthansa had to cancel 8,600 
flights last year at a cost of €222m, about half of which the airline attributed to lost future bookings. In the week 
before the Alps crash, pilots had gone on strike for an additional four days in a row. Management wrote to 
customers to apologise. Lufthansa does not yet know whether the strikes will have a long-term affect, nor has the 
airline published any data on bookings in the wake of the crash. But the company — which spans the no-frills 
Germanwings and Eurowings carriers plus cargo, maintenance and catering units — last year fell to a €732m net 
loss[8] under German accounting rules. Net debt doubled to €3.4bn and it was forced to scrap its dividend for the 
second time in three years.The crash has negatively affected the airline's image and profitability, but there's more. 
Like Malaysia Airlines, Lufthansa needs to deal with "legacy" costs in the form of fat pensions. Competition is also 
intense from budget carriers Germanwings was partly meant to compete with. In effect, Lufthansa is squeezed from 
Lufthansa and the German Reputation for Efficiency
above and below. From below you obviously have the low-cost, no-frills carriers offering competition on European 
routes. From above, you also have Middle Eastern carriers on international routes with the advantage of being 
situated in the region between Asia and Europe offering intense competition not only on fares but also on the quality 
of service (including frills like limousine services[9]): This loss partly reflected higher pension liabilities but 
Lufthansa's chief problem remains tough competition[10]. Having underestimated the challenge from budget 
carriers Ryanair and easyJet, it finds itself being undercut on long-haul routes to Asia by the Gulf 
carriers.<nl/>Lufthansa hoped a cost-cutting plan that included shedding 3,500 administrative jobs (3 per cent of 
group headcount) would help transform its fortunes. But while the programme led to a €2.5bn gross improvement in 
Lufthansa's results between 2012 and 2014, those savings were eaten up by cost inflation and lower fares.<nl/> 
With revenues stagnating, the airline has frozen the size of its fleet, even as the world aviation market continues to 
grow. 'Our most important priority, apart from safety, is our future viability,' Mr Spohr told shareholders last month, 
before the crash. Even for this proud German carrier, profits don't come easy. What can I say? It's a tough industry 
where nobody cares what your home country is.<nl/> [ 1]: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-22624104 [ 2]:

Airlines introduce 'rule of two' after Germanwings crash

lwpkommunikacio[1]<nl/> Two airlines have announced plans to introduce a 'rule of two' - meaning there much be 
two officials in the cockpit at all times, after a co-pilot reportedly crashed a Germanwings plane into the French Alps 
this week, killing all 150 passengers and crew on board.<nl/>
 Two budget European carriers, easyJet and Norwegian Air Shuttle, said yesterday that they would bring the new 
rule into almost immediate effect. Virgin Atlantic has also formalised the new rule following the tragic incident which 
occured earlier this week.<nl/> In a statement, Easyjet said: 'easyJet can confirm that, with effect from Friday 27 
March, it will change its procedure which will mean that two crew members will be in the cockpit at all times.<nl/> 
'This decision has been taken in consultation with the Civil Aviation Authority. The safety and security and of its 
passengers and crew is the airline's highest priority.'<nl/> A spokesman for Virgin Atlantic said: 'We always ensure 
we have the highest safety standards and, while it is our common practise to have two members of our crew in the 
flight deck at all times, in light of recent events we are now in the process of formalising this to be policy."<nl/> 
Norwegian's flight operations director, Thomas Hesthammer, said: 'We have been discussing this for a long time 
but this development has accelerated things. When one person leaves the cockpit, two people will now have to be 
there.'<nl/> Air Canada and the Canadian charter airline Air Transat also said they would require two people to be 
in the cockpit at all times.<nl/> The CAA said it had requested all UK carriers formally review procedures, a 
spokesman said: 'Following the details that have emerged regarding the tragic Germanwings incident, we are 
coordinating closely with colleagues at the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and have contacted all UK 
operators to require them to review all relevant procedures,' <nl/> US carriers already follow the 'rule of two', as do 
Jet2, Monarch, FlyBe and RyanAir.<nl/> [ 1]: https://www.flickr.com/photos/lwpkommunikacio/16041784560/

Reassessing Europe's air safety regulations
Reassessing Europe's air safety regulations
Deutsche Welle Europe

Mar 27, 2015( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> In 
the wake of the Germanwings crash, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is recommending a 'two-person 
rule' for cockpits. Who actually makes the rules regarding flight safety in Europe?
 The European Union has common regulations on pilot training, licensing and medical certification. The same is true 
for equipping planes with secure cockpit doors. Following the crash of Germanwings flight 4U 9525, both the 
European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is based in Cologne, and the European Commission confirmed 
these EU-wide standards at a press conference in Brussels.<nl/> According to EU officials who declined to be 
named, the common European regulations specify the minimum safety standards to which airlines must adhere. 
Airlines may also choose to impose stricter safety guidelines on themselves. National flight safety officials are 
responsible for ensuring that the minimum standards are met. In Germany, this is the Federal Aviation Office in 
Düsseldorf.<nl/> Europe has only had common aviation safety rules since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks 
on the United States. Previously, every member state was responsible for issuing its own regulations.<nl/> 
Checking psychological health<nl/> European Commission and EASA representatives also confirmed that pilots 
undergo medical examinations at least once a year. The exams include a psychological assessment to check for 
mental illness such as depression, they said.<nl/> "Pilots suffering from depression are considered unfit to fly, and 
they are not given their flight certification," one EU official said during a background discussion. Pilots also have a 
responsibility to tell their employer if they have a condition that would make them unfit to fly.<nl/> But Thorsten 
Onno Bender, a German doctor who regularly examines pilots, said the reality is different. He told DW that 
psychological illness is difficult to diagnose during a routine medical exam. He also said that there are no 
compulsory psychological tests.<nl/> The EASA representative in Brussels declined to comment on the 
circumstances around the Germanwings crash or the details that have emerged about co-pilot Andreas Lubitz's 
illness. A French prosecutor has accused Lubitz of deliberately crashing the plane, which was carrying 149 other 
people.<nl/> Measures aimed at threats from outside<nl/> After September 11, EASA required all airlines that take 
off or land in Europe to install secure cockpit doors. "But the point was to stop people outside the cockpit from 
getting in," an EASA representative said.<nl/> It appears that no one considered the possibility that the threat could 
come from one of the pilots. Europe also requires cockpits to be equipped with cameras to monitor the area in front 
of the cockpit door. One pilot is allowed to leave the cockpit for a short time, because the other pilot can see who is 
at the door. For that reason, EASA previously didn't consider it necessary to always have two people in the 
cockpit.<nl/> In the US, where cockpit cameras are not required, a second person is only needed to look through 
the door's peephole and open it to authorized personnel. "The two-person rule in the US and at some European 
airlines was never designed to monitor the remaining pilot in the cockpit," the EU official in Brussels said.<nl/> The 
Reassessing Europe's air safety regulations
Green Party's Michael Cramer, chairman of the European Parliament's transport committee, told German public 
radio he wants to see the introduction of a common EU-wide regulation requiring two people to always be present in 
the cockpit.<nl/> "The question is whether the co-pilot would have behaved the same way if he'd had a flight 
attendant next to him. When there was a knock on the door, could he then have prevented the door from being 
opened?" Cramer asked.<nl/> German airlines have announced that, for the time being, they will introduce the two-
person rule and remain in consultation with the Federal Aviation Office. British Airways, Scandinavia's SAS, and 
Latvia's Air Baltic have already said they would implement the rule. Czech airline CSA and Europe's biggest low-
cost airline, Ryanair, had already adopted a similar policy prior to Tuesday's crash.<nl/> Increased ground 
control<nl/> Given the circumstances surrounding the Germanwings crash, the European Commission and EASA 
intend to check whether new regulations for compulsory presence in the cockpit are necessary.<nl/> "That could 
take some time, because we still don't have all the facts," one EASA spokeswoman said. The organization could 
issue regulations at short notice in emergency situations, but according to EU authorities, there is no emergency at 
present.<nl/> Officials will also discuss whether changes need to be made to the locking mechanism on cockpit 
doors. The safety doors have had an overall positive effect, an EU spokeswoman said. "They have drastically 
reduced the number of hijacked planes worldwide," she said.<nl/> In the long term, the European Commission and 
EASA will also consider whether civilian aircraft should be subject to more control from air traffic controllers on the 
ground in order to prevent pilot error or criminal behavior, as was the case on the Germanwings plane.<nl/> But 
tests with "remote-controlled" jets are relatively new. With advances in technology, it could also one day be possible 
to fly planes with just one pilot on board, as long as a member of the cabin crew has some emergency training. 
Options like these are strictly for future consideration, though, said the EASA and EU representatives in 
Brussels.<nl/>

Mar 25, 2015( SourceWire: http://www.sourcewire.com Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> 2014 saw an almost constant 
increase in the number of foreigners visiting Spain, and the first two months of 2015 seem to boast promising 
figures for Spanish tourism. 
January and February saw a marked increase of 9.2 per cent more Britons travelling to Spain on low-cost 
airlines.<nl/><nl/>In recent years the rise of the low cost airline has become something many Europeans have 
come to love, as with cheaper holidays come increased tourism and stronger economic growth. The latest figures 
released by Spain's Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism show that this trend has not slowed down, with 3.3 
million passengers coming and going from Spain on low-cost flights in the first two months of 2015. This figure 
boasts an impressive increase of 14.4 percent on the figures from the same period in 2014. By the end of February 
2015 almost 45% of all international passengers entering and leaving Spain came and went on low-cost airlines - 3 
per cent more than the same period last year. The UK represents about one third of this low-cost travel, with Italy, 
Germany France and the Netherlands trailing behind in their wake.<nl/><nl/>Despite this increase in the low-cost 
area of air travel, traditional airlines have fared well over the same period, with their 4.1 million international 
passengers standing at an increased 1.7 per cent from last year. Ryanair, EasyJet and Vueling accounted for 67% 
of low-cost flights in and out of Spain in February alone, carrying 30% of the international travellers over the 28 
days. Ryanair still looks to be the most popular low-cost company of the big three, at a market share of 16% of 
travellers alone.<nl/><nl/>European EHIC Services Ltd., a UK provider of European Health Insurance Cards, takes 
a keen interest in news such as this. A spokesperson for the company provided the following statement: 'It's good to 
see that tourism is still on the rise in Spain. Between the fall in holiday and property prices and the current 
exchange rate working in favour of Britons travelling to Europe, interest in Spain is set to really take off this 
summer.'<nl/><nl/>'Before anyone jets off to enjoy the summer sun, it's important to remember that there are 
precautions to take before you travel. While it can be easy to forget about health care when you're travelling to a 
neighbour as close as Spain, in order to have access to health care at local rates in Spain, you will need to have a 
valid EHIC on your person.'<nl/><nl/>Europe EHIC Services Limited[1] helps people travelling to Europe with 
attaining a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), freely available from the NHS. European EHIC Services 
Limited assists in completing your application for an EHIC, ensuring that there are no errors or missing elements 
within the application. The card can only be used within the European Economic Area and Switzerland. - Buzz

Mar 25, 2015( Bdaily Business News: http://bdaily.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Nearly 2000 small 
businesses, charities and social enterprises across Manchester and Salford have gained grant funding for a 
superfast or ultrafast broadband connection.<nl/>
 The funding - just under £3000 per firm - from a scheme administered by Manchester City Council and funded by 
central government, supports connections for smaller organisations.<nl/> The Superconnected Cities scheme, 
which was due to end this month, has been extended for a further twelve months - giving more organisations the 
chance to upgrade their existing connection. <nl/> The scheme, which previously covered Manchester and Salford, 
has now been extended to reach the whole of Greater Manchester.<nl/> After receiving a voucher, companies only 
have to pay VAT, anything over £3,000 and the monthly subscription fee for their new broadband connection.<nl/> 
A voucher can be claimed by an individual organisation, or several organisations can apply as a group, through a 
landlord or agent.<nl/> The 1,000th voucher was granted to Couchbase, a tech company who recently moved into 
new premises in Manchester.<nl/> Couchbase is a Silicon Valley-based firm serving a worldwide client base 
including British Gas, Tesco and Ryanair, which has based its European technical support and product 
development base in the Northern Quarter. <nl/> David Haikney, who leads the Manchester team, said: ''For any 
expanding business wanting to project a professional image, high speed broadband is absolutely essential, so this 
voucher scheme really is a no-brainer.'<nl/> Couchbase provide a new breed of database software, NoSQL, 
designed to supercede older types of database which were not set up for the modern era - in which companies can 
receive millions of visits to their websites and often need to store billions of documents. <nl/> 'The Northern Quarter 
is an amazing, welcoming area and very attractive to tech companies. It has the potential to become globally 
important as a high-tech base, but for that to happen, the right infrastructure has to be in place', says David, who 
leads a team of ten and is actively looking to recruit new staff. <nl/> 'A big part of our role in the Manchester office is 
customer support. That means regular video-conferencing with customers and our colleagues over in California. 
Having the best possible internet connection is therefore crucial for our professional image. <nl/> 'Claiming the 
grant funding was tremendously straightforward for us - and it meant we had the internet connection we needed 
from day one."<nl/>

Germanwings plane crash hits stocks
Germanwings plane crash hits stocks

Mar 24, 2015( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> The crash of a 
Germanwings passenger plane over France has severely impacted stocks of parent company Lufthansa and also 
dragged down other aviation companies. 
The A320 in question was 24 years old. The Airfleets.net website reported Tuesday that the Airbus A320 
Germanwings plane that crashed over southern France was more than 24 years old and made its maiden flight on 
November 29, 1990.<nl/> The A320 is widely considered the most successful model of the European aircraft maker 
and has been used largely by budget, no-frills airlines such as Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings.<nl/> Since the 
start of deliveries, the plane has had no problems finding buyers as its operating costs have been far below the 737 
model of US rival Boeing. The A320 family also includes the A318, A319 and A321 variations, boasting many 
identical components and thus enabling airlines to save costs.<nl/> Markets react<nl/> Lufthansa CEO Carsten 
Spohr said Tuesday's plane crash marked a dark day in the company's history.<nl/> Lufthansa shares dropped by 
around 6 percent in value shortly after the news of the accident broke, after having climbed to a more-than-six-week 
high earlier in the day.<nl/> Other aviation stocks were also impacted negatively, including shares of Ryanair and 
Easyjet. Airbus itself saw its stock go down by 2 percent shortly after the plane crash.<nl/> hg/pad (AFP,

Mar 24, 2015( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ;<nl/> A Germanwings 
Airbus 320 carrying 144 passengers crashed in southern France[1] on Tuesday morning as it was flying 
from Barcelona, Spain, to Düsseldorf, Germany. <nl/> Germanwings is a low-cost airline that is entirely owned by 
Lufthansa, Germany's flag carrier. <nl/>
 Based in Cologne, it was founded in 2002 as a subsidiary of another Lufthansa-owned airline, Eurowings. <nl/> 
Germanwings was set up as a direct competitor to Ryanair and easyJet, Europe's top budget airlines. The whole 
fleet features only economy class accommodations.<nl/> Germanwings has an excellent safety record, a[2]ccording 
to AirlineRatings.com[3], which gave the budget carrier six out of seven stars on its website. According to 
aeroinside.com[4], there have been several reports of a cracked windshield in the past, though Tuesday morning's 
crash is the first major incident for the Lufthansa subsidiary.<nl/> In 2012, Lufthansa announced it was combining 
all its short-haul flights under Germanwings[5] except those from its Munich and Frankfurt hubs. The move was 
intended to save costs on domestic and short international flights while allowing Lufthansa to focus on 
intercontinental trips to North America and Asia. <nl/> The reorganization brought the Germanwings fleet up to 83 
active planes, most of them Airbus A319 and A320[6] jets. Germanwings flies to 117 destinations in 31 
countries.<nl/> Germanwings is known in Europe for its "blind-flight" promotions: customers can buy discounted 
tickets to unknown destinations[7], choosing their flights only from the departure airport and the type of trip they are 
looking for. Travelers can choose from clusters like "shopping," "party," or "gay-friendly," and then the system will 
allocate tickets to the destinations accordingly. <nl/> Earlier this year, Lufthansa announced it was transferring all its 
Germanwings operations to its former parent company Eurowings[8] in another move intended to slash costs and 
restructure operations. <nl/> Last month, hundreds of flights from Munich, Frankfurt, and Berlin had to be cancelled 
because of a 36-hour walkout[9] over anticipated pension plans for 5,400 Lufthansa pilots and operators, including 
several Germanwings employees. <nl/>NOW WATCH: This incredible 'Jurassic Park' short used $100,000 worth of

Senior Tory: David Cameron has made us a 'party for the rich'

Mar 24, 2015( Politics.co.uk: http://www.politics.co.uk Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> David Cameron has failed to 
shake off the Conservative's image as "a party of the one per cent" and now faces being ousted from Downing 
Street, a senior Tory said last night.<nl/> Former Conservative minister and London mayoral candidate Steve Norris 
said his party was suffering in the polls because of perceptions they are a party of the rich.<nl/>
 "Over the past five years one of the images David Cameron has never quite been able to shake off is the image of 
being the party of the one per cent," he told a meeting at the Centre for London think tank.<nl/> He compared 
Cameron's failure to connect with ordinary voters, to the success of his rival, Boris Johnson.<nl/><nl/> "It's very 
interesting how Boris is never thought of as being particularly posh despite being by any definition rather posher 
than David Cameron," he said.<nl/> Norris mocked Cameron's repeated attempts to shed his posh image.<nl/> 
"There he was taking poor old Samantha on a three star hotel holiday on Ryanair to Majorca. If I'd been Samantha 
I'd have divorced him. I mean sod it sunshine. I don't mind if you've got a few quid. Go out and spend it. Be who you 
are. Don't try and be something you're not."<nl/> "Unfortunately what it's meant is we are seen as being the party of 
the one per cent and a lot of the things he has done have managed to portray him in that way."<nl/> He said the 
party needed to change from the top down.<nl/> "It's not about legislative change it's about a change in attitude and 
approach and that can only come from the top of the party," he added.<nl/> Norris also attacked his party's failure 
to secure the votes of ethnic minorities and new migrants.<nl/> "In theory the Conservative party ought to be the 
party for new migrants. They are almost exclusively people who come here to work and to build and to bring 
families and to improve themselves and those are all the virtues that a party of people who aspire to improve 
themselves ought to be attracted to and we're not."<nl/> He warned that the Tories often appear to "resent" 
migrants.<nl/> "The general sense is that we sort of slightly resent newcomers because we like things just as they 
were. It's a more literal interpretation of what 'conservative' means. It certainly isn't why I ever joined the party but 
it's there."<nl/> Norris's comments followed those from fellow panelist Ben Page from pollsters Ipsos Mori, who 
suggested that voters are increasingly voting along ethnic lines in London.<nl/> Norris agreed with Page and said 
the party is now likely to lose in May.<nl/> "I suspect that on balance it is more likely to be a minority Labour 
administration," he said, before adding that a Conservative win was still possible.<nl/> Norris tipped leading 
backbencher Zac Goldsmith as a rising star in the party and the Tory's best chance of winning the London 
mayoralty next year.<nl/> "Zac Goldsmith would be enormously impressive [as mayor]. I love Zac in a bromance 
kind of way you understand. He's a terrific MP. He's massively respected in his seat."<nl/> Norris praised Goldsmith 
for not just spending his enormous personal wealth on drugs and trips abroad.<nl/> "He could be sitting on a beach 
stuffing coke up his nose. He doesn't. He works very hard for his constituents. He's got more money than you could 
Senior Tory: David Cameron has made us a 'party for the rich'
shake a stick at. He's worth hundreds of millions and yet despite that he just works hard."<nl/> Responding to the 
comments on Twitter today, Goldsmith joked that he only did coke "on weekends and Bank 
Holidays".<nl/><nl/>@PippaCrerar[1] @StevenJNorris[2] only on weekends and Bank Holidays<nl/>— Zac 
Goldsmith (@ZacGoldsmith) March 24, 2015[3]<nl/>Goldsmith has told friends that he is unlikely to stand for the 
London mayoralty in 2016, preferring to wait until 2020. However, he is coming under increasing pressure to 
reconsider. Norris said he thought Goldsmith could be persuaded.;<nl/> "I know what he's going to do. He wants to 
get the [general] election out of the way and no candidate who has got any parliamentary ambition is going to say 
anything until after the election. But he doesn't need to say it. I will say it for him. He will be a great candidate.<nl/> 
"He would take votes from Labour. He would take votes from the Lib Dems. He would take votes from the Greens. 
And London loves a maverick."<nl/> Labour today leapt on Norris' comments about Cameron.<nl/> "This criticism 
from a senior Conservative is damaging and embarrassing for David Cameron. Even his own party think the prime 
minister stands only for a privileged few," Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Ashworth MP said.<nl/> 
"With David Cameron sparking a leadership contest, candidates resigning and the Chairman embroiled in scandal it 
is clear the Tory campaign is in chaos and turning in on itself."<nl/> [ 1]: https://twitter.com/PippaCrerar [ 2]:

Mar 20, 2015( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Just four days after 
announcing plans for US flights, Irish budget airline Ryanair has apparently dropped the idea of running 
transatlantic routes of its own, 'clarifying' its business plan for the the next five years. 
Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair said in a statement released late on Thursday that its board had "not considered or 
approved any transatlantic project," and didn't intend to do so.<nl/> The surprise announcement came after the no-
frills airline unveiled big plans on Monday for offering low-cost flights on transatlantic routes in the next five years. 
Flight fares would start from as little as 10 pounds ($14, 13.9 euros), the Dublin-based carrier said in a statement, 
with the company board approving the plans. <nl/> However, Ryanair's U-turn on US flights doesn't rule out the 
possibility of the airline establishing a separate company at some time in the future to provide transatlantic 
services.<nl/> News agency Reuters on Thursday quoted a source familiar with the matter as saying that the 
company was still considering the launch of a sister company to offer flights across the Atlantic.<nl/> Ryanair Chief 
Executive Michael O'Leary has long eyed operating long-haul services in addition to its low-cost short-haul 
business in Europe. But he's repeatedly stressed that they would have to be run separately in order to be 
profitable.<nl/> uhe/ng (Reuters, AFP, dpa)<nl/>

Mar 20, 2015( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ;<nl/> Europeans 
rejoiced when they first heard the news that it could be possible to get a return flight to the US for as little as 
£10[1].<nl/> However, despite the Guardian and others reporting that the Irish budget airline's[2] board already 
approved plans to begin flights between up to 14 destinations in Europe and the US[3], Ryanair were quick to 
debunk any idea of the sort.<nl/>
 The budget airline said in a statement: "In the light of recent press coverage, the Board of Ryanair Holdings Plc 
wishes to clarify that it has not considered or approved any transatlantic project and does not intend to do 
so.[4]"<nl/> On March 16, the Guardian went into detail about how Ryanair's five-year strategy[5] included operating 
some transatlantic flights.<nl/> Cities served would include New York, Boston, and Chicago stateside and London 
Stansted, Berlin, and Ryanair's native Dublin across the pond. The long-haul flights were tipped to begin service in 
four or five years' time.<nl/> Alas, at the moment, it looks like wishful thinking. It probably would not have been as 
cheap as everyone thought anyway.<nl/> The Telegraph estimated that a return fare would cost £185.20 ($273.24) 
as Ryanair charges customers extra for a range of services including baggage, food, drink and even paper tickets if 
you forget to print them off.<nl/> Obviously, given the nature of Ryanair, which adds lots of extra costs to tickets, the 
£10 price tag ($14.75) will be much more once everything paid for. Food and drink, baggage fees, and other extras 
bump up the price. <nl/> Meanwhile, the cheapest flights to the US at the moment are around £300 on the London 
Gatwick service with Norwegian Air Shuttle — without baggage.<nl/>NOW WATCH: Watch 2 armed gangs fight on

hand it to Michael O'Leary, CEO of El-Cheapo, Irish airline, Ryanair. 
This is the guy that generates more PR than Richard 'Call me Sir, or I will have you hung, drawn ...artered,' 
Branson. Paddy O'Leary has just announced that at some time in the future, he will offer flights between the US and 
Europe for fifteen fucking dollars! Never forget, this is the guy who at one time wanted to introduce pay-toilets and 
standing room only on his flights. Also, the flights for most Ryanair routes don't actually go to the advertised cities, 
but to abandoned WW1 airfields, that'll invariably cost a couple of hundred dollar cab ride to get to the actual city. 
According to AdWeek[1], he can't make money on the $15 flight, but by the time you've paid all the additional fees 
for 'ramp use' to get on the plane, 'oxygen use' for breathing, and a 'tissue tariff' for something to wipe your arse 
on… The guy is making serious money. I'd rather stick to 'Yorkshire Airlines.'[2] Ay up and away!<nl/> On Ryanair...

<nl/> Lufthansa passengers are set to face a third consecutive day of travel chaos after German pilots union 
Vereinigung Cockpit extended the ongoing strike until Friday. 
The walk-out is the thirteenth in a year. Vereinigung Cockpit called on Lufthansa pilots on Wednesday evening to 
extend the ongoing strike to Friday, with short and medium-haul flights facing disruptions.<nl/> The first day of the 
current walk out saw the cancellation of some 750 domestic flights. Around 80,000 passengers planning to travel on 
short- and medium-haul flights were affected.<nl/> The announcement came just hours before the Lufthansa pilots 
began their second day of strikes, which extended across long-haul and cargo flights.<nl/> Flights with Lufthansa's 
subsidiary carriers, Germanwings and Eurowings, remained unaffected.<nl/> Retirement dispute<nl/> The ongoing 
dispute between Germany's flagship air carrier and Cockpit lies at the heart of the airline's plans to compete with 
low-cost airlines sich as Ryanair and easyJet.<nl/> In order to cut costs and expand budget operations, Lufthansa is 
proposing to raise the age at which its pilots can take early retirement. The airline's pilots are currently currently 
able to retire at age 55 and receive up to 60 percent of their pay until the normal pension kicks in at the age of 
65.<nl/> Months of renewed strikes have followed unsuccessful negotiations, which cost Lufthansa around 232 
million euros ($245 million) last year alone.<nl/> ksb/bk (Reuters, AFP, dpa)<nl/>

564225.jpg<nl/> 'Watch-list of suspected European Islamic State sympathisers stands at 10,000 people,' By Aaron 
Brown, Express.co.uk[1]<nl/>
 THE SHEER quantity of names handed over by the EU makes the task of policing the Turkish border with Syria an 
almost IMPOSSIBLE task, an expert has warned.<nl/> Jytte Klausen, who is the founder of the Western Jihadism 
Project, said the watchlist given to officials is a 'capacity busting proposition'.<nl/> 'The Turks complained that they 
can't do it, and you know what, they can't,' the Harvard and Brandeis University professor explained.<nl/> 'It's a 
capacity busting proposition, to watch out for 10,000 westerners.<nl/> 'They are not going to be able to check most 
names on that list of 10,000.<nl/> 'Only if there is a case where there is an urgent bulletin out, because it has been 
discovered that they had left - and the urgent bulletin would be on the top of the desk - that's when you can catch 
people as happened here.'<nl/> Her comments come hours after three British teenage boys were detained by 
officials in the country as they planned to travel to Syria.<nl/> The three teens were detained after British police 
were made aware on Friday two boys had gone missing and were believed to be travelling to Syria.<nl/> Inquiries 
revealed they had travelled with a third person, the 19-year-old man.<nl/> It has been reported that the trio travelled 
to Spain and then took a flight to Turkey.<nl/><nl/>PA<nl/> Left to Right: The suspected Jihadi Brides - Kadiza 
Sultana, Shamima Begum and Amira Abase <nl/> Hayat Boumedienne, the widow of one of the terrorists who 
carried out an attack in Paris in January, also touched down in Syria via Turkey and Spain.<nl/>Prof Klausen 
described the indirect routes that are increasingly taken by would-be jihadists.<nl/> Due to gaps in intelligence 
sharing, travelling through another country makes it easier to arrive undetected.<nl/> She said: 'There is not 
comprehensive data sharing among the European Union countries with respect to people who are merely 
suspected of doing something. Getting on a plane is subject to far less scrutiny than getting off a plane.<nl/> 
'Therefore you have airports like Gatwick, and other European airports, that have a lot of discount airlines flying 
out.<nl/> 'They have been put under strict orders to look out for certain risk profiles. But they look out for their own 
folk, so at Gatwick, you are not going to look for people from Spain, and vice versa.'<nl/><nl/>Booking seperate 
tickets and splitting up the journey to war torn Syria can make it more difficult for authorities to hunt down the would-
be Jihadis, she warned.<nl/>She added: 'It's become common practice to buy separate itineraries, so if you book on 
Ryanair to go to Spain, and you were booked on another itinerary to go from Spain to Istanbul, those two itineraries 
do not come up as connected travel documents when you leave Gatwick.'<nl/> She added that Turkey was not the 
Watch-list of European Islamic State sympathisers stands at 10,000 people
only route to reach Syria. 'We do know of a number of people who have not flown directly from Spain to Turkey, but 
who have taken the far more cumbersome route through north Africa.'<nl/> Once through immigration in Turkey, 'It 
really is as easy as getting on a bus', she said.<nl/> 'I think there is a lot of very innocent traffic there too (going to 
the border).<nl/> 'I have been on those buses in Turkey, everyone goes on the buses, there are a lot of tourists. 
How are you going to tell from a bunch of young girls who are tourists from people who want to go to Syria?'<nl/> 
She added: 'These days most of them dress like tourists, or if they have a beard they shave it. The girls dress like 
normal teenagers.'<nl/> [ 1]: http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/564225/ISIS-Islamic-State-European-Union-

One of these days.<nl/> Hello earthlings! Goodness. We've had back to back issues within less than a week this 
last week due to yours truly traipsing around the countryside.<nl/> Last week I was at the ISTAT Americas 
conference in Scottsdale. Subscribers got to hear about the Bombardier/Embraer presentation that proved 
Bombardier doesn't have a clue as to how to address the perception issues of its CSeries. Then we talked a great 
deal about AVITAS SVP Adam Pilarski's update on the price of oil and why he thinks it's not going higher anytime 
soon.<nl/> For more than a few years, Adam has steadfastly said that oil was going to drop to $40 a barrel — and 
his reasons seem pretty valid today.<nl/> Then we talked about just what Air Lease Corp.'s Steve Hazy wants in 
Boeing's new airplane. Hint: Twin aisle. 200-225 seats.<nl/> But we talked about a lot more — but that was last 
week.<nl/> In this week's follow-up issue we give you our take on the Aviation Summit that was held in Washington 
on Tuesday. This year it became a place where both sides of the Open Skies fight presented their respective cases. 
Lots of noise around all of this — but all of that really means nothing. We remain convinced that the report the U.S. 
carriers has put together is more than enough for the State Department to open up consultations on the Open Skies 
agreements.<nl/> We also talk this week about American Airlines' inclusion in the S...00; Ryanair's plans to start up 
a trans-Atlantic operation; Spirit's descent into adolescent frat house humor again; Spirit's arrival in the monthly 
DOT Air Travel Consumer Report, and we also have another Cranky Analysis column by Brett Snyder. This week 
Brett, who moonlights as a contributing editor for us, looks at the Atlanta market. Have fares gone down since 
Southwest Airlines has eliminated AirTran? Not hardly.<nl/> All of this, and much, much more — in this week's 
edition of PlaneBusiness Banter. [1]<nl/> [ 1]: http://www.planebusiness.com/banter/

Mar 19, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ;<nl/> For Immediate 
Release<nl/> <nl/> Chicago, IL - March 19, 2015 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst 
Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the 
financial markets. 
Stocks recently featured in the blog include the American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL[1]-Free Report[2]), Ryanair 
Holdings (RYAAY[3]-Free Report[4]), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU[5]-Free Report[6]), Delta Airlines (DAL[7]-
Free Report[8]) and United Continental Holdings (UAL[9]-Free Report[10]).<nl/> <nl/> Today, Zacks is promoting its 
''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free[11].<nl/> <nl/> Here are highlights from 
Wednesday's Analyst Blog:<nl/> <nl/> Airline Stock Roundup<nl/> <nl/> It was a week which saw a new member 
from the airline space making its way into the coveted S...00 index - American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL[12]-Free 
Report[13]). The carrier is set to join the much sought-after list from Mar 20 (after market close), replacing Allergan, 
which has been acquired by Actavis.<nl/> <nl/> European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY[14]-Free 
Report[15]) also grabbed headlines during the week with its board approving plans to connect destinations between 
the U.S. and Europe at amazingly low fares. However, the transatlantic service is unlikely to commence before 
another four/five years.<nl/> <nl/> Low-cost carrier JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU[16]-Free Report[17]) was 
also in the news for a bilateral codeshare agreement inked with privately held Silver Airways. JetBlue also 
announced healthy traffic data for the month of February. Important metrics such as revenue passenger miles 
(RPMs - a measure of air traffic), available seat miles (measure of capacity) and load factor (% of seats filled by 
passengers) grew on a year-over-year basis during the month.<nl/> <nl/> On the price front, most airline stocks 
gained over the past 5 trading days, benefiting from plummeting oil prices. As a result, the NYSE ARCA Airline 
index climbed 5% over the said period.<nl/> <nl/> (Read the last 'Airline Stock Roundup' here: Delta-Led 
Consortium Complains, Republic Airways Included in S...00[18])<nl/> <nl/> Recap of the Most Important Stories 
Over the Past Week<nl/> <nl/> 1. JetBlue Airways inked a codeshare agreement with Florida-based Silver Airways 
with the aim to improve customer convenience. The current deal extends the Dec 2013 ticketing partnership signed 
by the two companies (read more: JetBlue, Silver Airways Ink Codeshare Pact; Strengthen Ties[19]).<nl/> <nl/> 
Furthermore, JetBlue Airways' Feb 2015 air traffic was up 10% year over year to 2.9 billion. Capacity improved 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: American Airlines Group , Ryanair Holdings , JetBlue Airways , Delta 
Airlines and United Continental Holdings - Press Release....
7.4% to 3.47 billion and load factor increased to 83.5% from 81.6% in Feb 2014 (read more: JetBlue's February 
Traffic Rises on Favorable Factors[20]).<nl/> <nl/> 2. American Airlines Group, formed following the Dec 2013 
merger of AMR (American Airlines' parent group) and US Airways, is set to join the S...00 after market close on Mar 
20. The carrier has been added to the S...00 GICS 'Industrials' sector or Airlines Sub-Industry index (read more: 
American Airlines Group to Enter Coveted S...00[21]).<nl/> <nl/> 3. According to media reports, the board of 
Ryanair has approved the carrier's plans to connect destinations across the U.S. and Europe. Approval has been 
gained to operate to and from around 14 European cities and almost an equivalent number of American cities. 
Ticket prices have been kept unbelievably low with one-way tickets between US and Europe costing approximately 
$15 (promotional offer) according to a report at investors.com.<nl/> <nl/> The services, however, are not 
commencing immediately. It will take another four to five years as Ryanair needs to bolster its fleet before entering 
the lucrative transatlantic market. In the event of Ryanair entering the U.S. market, competition would intensify for 
domestic carriers that already face the threat of market share reduction from Gulf carriers.<nl/> <nl/> 4. According 
to a report appearing in the Reuters, the dispute between US carriers and their Gulf counterparts took a fresh turn 
with the U.S. government asking Delta Airlines (DAL[22]-Free Report[23]), United Continental Holdings (UAL[24]-
Free Report[25]) and American Airlines Group to furnish more information to support their claim of massive 
subsidies enjoyed by certain Gulf carriers.<nl/> <nl/> The U.S. carriers, in a complaint to the Obama administration, 
had alleged that massive government subsidies have allowed Gulf carriers like Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and 
Emirates to expand their fleet and international operations substantially, in turn, eating into their market share. 
According to the report, the Obama administration has put forward approximately 20 questions to representatives of 
the U.S. carriers based on their allegations.<nl/> <nl/> Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.

RyanAir To Introduce $15 Transatlantic Flights - Before Taxes

Mar 18, 2015( Taxgirl.com: http://www.taxgirl.com Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> I'm planning a trip to Europe[1] this 
year and preparing to take the kids along. There are three of them and as they've grown too big to successfully hide 
in my luggage (even though I pack rather light), that means that I get to buy them tickets, too. They love this. 
My bank account does not.<nl/> So you can imagine that I was pretty excited to hear that Europe's biggest budget 
carrier, Ryanair, is planning to offer some seriously cheap transatlantic flights by 2020. I realize that's still five years 
away but my kiddos will still be in tow by then (frankly, I can't imagine the youngest ever letting me leave without 
him - especially when he gets wind that I'm headed near an English Premier League site).<nl/> RyanAir's plan is to 
offer flights at deeply discounted prices from Europe to the U.S. I realize that's the wrong way (since I'm on this side 
of the pond) but I'm guessing those flights will also head back the other way. I can make this work - especially since 
tickets would start at £10 ($15 US). No, that's not a typo. They really are hoping to price tickets beginning at £10 
($15 US)[2], or roughly the cost that I pay to get to and from the City of Philadelphia by train. Suburban Philadelphia 
to Philadelphia, New York to London. What's the difference? Apparently, not much. Except for the whole flying over 
the ocean part.<nl/> But before you start planning your trip to Hogwarts, there's a catch: those little 'extras' for 
which RyanAir, like other budget airlines, charges you additional. Things like baggage and seat reservations. They 
also charge for air. Really. For £50 ($73 US) per hour, you can reserve therapeutic oxygen[3].<nl/> The real 
charges, however, are taxes[4]. You'll pay an estimated $200 in taxes for that £10 ($15 US) ticket from the U.K. to 
the U.S. That works out to about 1300%. And unlike the fare, you can't use a service like Kayak to negotiate your 
tax bill down.<nl/> BARCELONA, SPAIN - FEBRUARY 10: Planes operated by Vueling and RyanAir are seen at 
Aena operated Barcelona - El Prat International Airport on February 10, 2015 in Barcelona, Spain. Shares in state-
controlled Spanish airports operator, Aena, began trading today on the Madrid stock market. The Spanish 
government will retain a 51% controlling share in the firm, as it seeks to raise 3.9 billion Euros through the sale of 
the remaining 49%. Aena operates major hubs in Barcelona and Madrid, as well as a further 15 airports in Europe 
and America, including London Luton. (Photo by David Ramos/Getty Images)<nl/> In fact, taxes and fees on travel-
related services[5] continually astonish eager travelers each year. The cost of the most basic trip can easily 
escalate quickly. In the U.S., federal taxes and fees make up more than 20% of the cost of a typical $300 ticket. 
Even worse: the cost of fees and taxes has increased each year since 1971 even though the average cost of the 
base fare has decreased (you can download a historic list of air travel-related excise taxes here[6] as a pdf).<nl/> 
Inside our own borders (plus Canada and Mexico), your ticket could include a ticket tax of 7.5%; a flat Travel[7] 
Facilities Tax of $8.70 on flight segments to or from Alaska or Hawaii; a flat U.S. Federal Segment Fee of $4.00 
within the continental United States; a Passenger Facility Charge of up to $4.50 per facility; and the September 11th 
RyanAir To Introduce $15 Transatlantic Flights - Before Taxes
Security[8] Fee of up to $5.60 one-way[9], or $11.20 roundtrip (however, there's no cap so the fee applies to each 
of multiple stops).<nl/><nl/>And if you're wondering what all of this has to do with flights leaving from outside of our 
borders, that's because U.S. taxes may apply to those, too. You can expect to pay the U.S. International[10] 
Transportation Tax of $17.50 for all flights arriving in or departing from the United States, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. 
Virgin Islands; a $5.00 U.S. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Fee; and a $7.00 U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Fee for international arrivals. Those are just U.S. based fees: that doesn't include foreign taxes and 
fees imposed by other countries.<nl/> If those fees feel a little bit higher than this same time last year, you're not 
crazy. Fees were bumped last year. Specifically, on July 21, 2014, Congress boosted the September 11th Security 
Fee from $2.50 per leg with a $5.00 cap to $5.60 per leg with no cap. Folks weren't happy about that so the law 
changed again[11] in December 2014, imposing a cap on round trip travel. And before you exhale a breath because 
those fees are keeping us safe, it's worth noting that the fee hike is not earmarked for increased security: it was part 
of a deficit reduction strategy.<nl/> Other fees and taxes may also apply to hotels, booze and food - you certainly 
won't get out of a trip abroad tax free.<nl/> But look at it this way: if you're saving a few hundred dollars on airfare, 
you'll have more money for Guinness, Quidditch sets and invisibility cloaks (my kids swear we can buy those).<nl/>

Mar 18, 2015( SourceWire: http://www.sourcewire.com Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Leading providers of the EHIC, 
Europe EHIC Services Limited, has reported on Ryanair's recent investment in more Boeing planes after passenger 
traffic jumps.<nl/>
<nl/>Ryanair have recently gone shopping for more jets and have bought three Boeing 737-800 aircraft of an 
estimated worth of $280 million at list price. The Irish firm has continued to enjoy strong traffic figures, which have 
led to the recent purchases. The latest Boeings will bring the total to 183 new 737-800's in Ryanair's hangars, with 
the latest three to be delivered early next year. <nl/><nl/>Chief executive, Michael O'Leary, wants to grow annual 
passenger numbers from 90 million passengers to 160 million passengers by 2024. The entrepreneur pointed out 
that the growth would create around 10,000 new positions for pilots, cabin crew and engineers, as tourism 
throughout Europe continues to grow. New routes across the EU will create new opportunities and jobs 
internationally across a range of sectors. <nl/><nl/>Creating more winter routes, rather than reducing capacity 
during the colder months, meant Ryanair saw its traffic grow by 29% to 5.8million fliers in February. The load factor, 
which measures how many plane seats were full, increased by 11% to 89%. <nl/><nl/>The airline has now outlined 
its latest customer service improvements for the coming years. They are set to begin trimming airport check-in fees 
and missed flight charges, and make it easier to opt-out of its own-brand travel insurance.<nl/><nl/>As experts in 
European travel, Europe EHIC Services Limited takes a keen interest in relevant industry news. A spokesperson 
from the company has made the following statement. 'With more flight routes and seats available on budget airlines 
than ever before, more and more tourists will be taking trips to destinations throughout Europe. <nl/><nl/>This is a 
fantastic opportunity for countries, tourists and airlines alike. However, as passenger traffic increases it's imperative 
that tourists are travelling with correct travel insurance. <nl/><nl/>'Travelling Brits should always be carrying a valid 
and in-date European Health Insurance Card. As we travel to Europe more frequently, we will need our EHIC's 
more than ever before. <nl/><nl/>The card gives travellers access to discounted or free state healthcare in most 
European destinations. With Ryanair making it easier to opt-out of own brand travel insurance, it's imperative that 
tourists are always carrying the right kind of insurance protection with them at all times.'<nl/><nl/>Europe EHIC 
Services Limited[1] helps people travelling to Europe with attaining a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), 
freely available from the NHS. European EHIC Services Limited assists in completing your application for an EHIC, 
ensuring that there are no errors or missing elements within the application. The card can only be used within the 
European Economic Area and Switzerland. - Buzz Carter 18-03-2015<nl/> [ 1]: http://europeanhealthcard.org.uk

Mar 18, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> In line with its 
ambitious five-year expansion plans, Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[1] has decided to initiate 
transatlantic flights with fares starting at as low as £10 for a one-way trip.<nl/>Initially, Ryanair will connect around 
14 cities like London, Berlin and Dublin in Europe and a dozen locations in the U.S. including cities like New York, 
Boston and Chicago.<nl/>
To support such large-scale expansion, the carrier has decided to expand its fleet size with Boeing 787 Dreamliners 
to its existing fleet. The company has also placed an order for 183 Boeing 737 aircraft and 200 Boeing MAX 200 
planes.<nl/>This a major development for the carrier as this initiative has opened up the busiest airline market for 
the company. If successful in implementing its plans, Ryanair will likely pose significant competitive threat to U.S. 
low-cost carriers like Southwest Airlines Co. LUV[2] and Spirit Airlines SAVE[3]. Moreover, leading U.S. carriers like 
Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL[4], American Airlines and United Airlines will also face the burnt with competition 
intensifying in the transatlantic route.<nl/>In Europe, Ryanair offers flights to 170 cities, inclusive of the less popular 
ones, at extremely low fares. The company expects fiscal 2014 traffic to exceed 90 million with load factor likely to 
reach 87%. In Feb 2015, the company reported financial numbers for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 wherein 
revenues jumped 17% year over year. Moreover, the carrier witnessed 14% growth in passengers against the last-
year quarter figure.<nl/>Braving all economic odds, Ryanair continues to perform strongly for the last 30 years, 
surpassing the performance of most European carriers. Hence, we believe that Ryanair is poised to gain 
significantly with the transatlantic route addition across the U.S. and European region.<nl/>Ryanair currently carries

Mar 18, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> It was a week 
which saw a new member from the airline space making its way into the coveted S...00 index - American Airlines 
Group Inc. AAL[1]. The carrier is set to join the much sought-after list from Mar 20 (after market close), replacing 
Allergan, which has been acquired by Actavis.<nl/>European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2] also 
grabbed headlines during the week with its board approving plans to connect destinations between the U.S. and 
Europe at amazingly low fares. 
However, the transatlantic service is unlikely to commence before another four/five years.<nl/>Low-cost carrier 
JetBlue Airways Corporation JBLU[3] was also in the news for a bilateral codeshare agreement inked with privately 
held Silver Airways. JetBlue also announced healthy traffic data for the month of February. Important metrics such 
as revenue passenger miles (RPMs - a measure of air traffic), available seat miles (measure of capacity) and load 
factor (% of seats filled by passengers) grew on a year-over-year basis during the month.<nl/>On the price front, 
most airline stocks gained over the past 5 trading days, benefiting from plummeting oil prices. As a result, the NYSE 
ARCA Airline index climbed 5% over the said period.<nl/>(Read the last 'Airline Stock Roundup' here: Delta-Led 
Consortium Complains, Republic Airways Included in S...00[4])<nl/>Recap of the Most Important Stories Over the 
Past Week<nl/>1. JetBlue Airways inked a codeshare agreement with Florida-based Silver Airways with the aim to 
improve customer convenience. The current deal extends the Dec 2013 ticketing partnership signed by the two 
companies (read more: JetBlue, Silver Airways Ink Codeshare Pact; Strengthen Ties[5]).<nl/>Furthermore, JetBlue 
Airways' Feb 2015 air traffic was up 10% year over year to 2.9 billion. Capacity improved 7.4% to 3.47 billion and 
load factor increased to 83.5% from 81.6% in Feb 2014 (read more: JetBlue's February Traffic Rises on Favorable 
Factors[6]).<nl/>2. American Airlines Group, formed following the Dec 2013 merger of AMR (American Airlines' 
parent group) and US Airways, is set to join the S...00 after market close on Mar 20. The carrier has been added to 
the S...00 GICS 'Industrials' sector or Airlines Sub-Industry index (read more: American Airlines Group to Enter 
Coveted S...00[7]).<nl/>3. According to media reports, the board of Ryanair has approved the carrier's plans to 
connect destinations across the U.S. and Europe. Approval has been gained to operate to and from around 14 
European cities and almost an equivalent number of American cities. Ticket prices have been kept unbelievably low 
with one-way tickets between US and Europe costing approximately $15 (promotional offer) according to a report at 
investors.com.<nl/>The services, however, are not commencing immediately. It will take another four to five years 
as Ryanair needs to bolster its fleet before entering the lucrative transatlantic market. In the event of Ryanair 
entering the U.S. market, competition would intensify for domestic carriers that already face the threat of market 
share reduction from Gulf carriers.<nl/>4. According to a report appearing in the Reuters, the dispute between US 
Airline Stock Roundup: American Airlines to Join SP 500 - Analyst Blog
carriers and their Gulf counterparts took a fresh turn with the U.S. government asking Delta Airlines DAL[8], United 
Continental Holdings UAL[9] and American Airlines Group to furnish more information to support their claim of 
massive subsidies enjoyed by certain Gulf carriers.<nl/>The U.S. carriers, in a complaint to the Obama 
administration, had alleged that massive government subsidies have allowed Gulf carriers like Qatar Airways, 
Etihad Airways and Emirates to expand their fleet and international operations substantially, in turn, eating into their 
market share. According to the report, the Obama administration has put forward approximately 20 questions to 
representatives of the U.S. carriers based on their allegations.<nl/>5. Troubles do not seem to end at Germany's 
Deutsche Lufthansa Aktiengesellschaft DLAKY[10] with the carrier's pilots calling yet another strike on the non-
resolution of disputes regarding early retirement benefits. Furthermore, the German carrier's plan to expand low-
cost offerings has also come under attack from the pilots. The pilots had gone on strike several times over the same 
issue in 2014, resulting in flight cancellations and loss of profit for the airline.<nl/>Performance<nl/>The following

Mar 17, 2015( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> I can't remember the first 
time we heard Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary talk about wanting to fly Transatlantic but it's been something he's 
talked about for years. And now, the board has officially voted to make it happen[1]… in the next 5 years. The 
Atlantic is littered with graves of failed low cost efforts, but if anyone is going to figure out how to make this work, 
Ryanair is a good candidate.<nl/>
<nl/>The problem with low-cost, long-haul flying is that the longer the flight, the fewer chances there are to cut 
costs. On longer flights, fuel eats up a greater percentage of total cost than on shorter flights. And there is no low 
cost fuel (not that you'd want to use, anyway). Sure, there are airplanes that are more fuel efficient, but the tradeoff 
is a very high capital expense to acquire those aircraft. Just ask Norwegian. It spent a bunch of money on buying 
those expensive 787s to fly to the US, and it's still trying to figure out how to make money with them.<nl/> There's 
also a problem of demand. On longer haul flights, the low fare, leisure demand is much more cyclical than on 
shorter domestic flights. With Ryanair, people in the UK think nothing of hopping off to Spain for a weekend in the 
middle of winter. But a longer trip to the US? That's usually saved for longer breaks often centered around school 
holidays. During the rest of the year, business demand is stronger but that's more often in the premium cabin, 
something that most low cost carriers don't try to tackle.<nl/> But Michael O'Leary is a smart man and he knows all 
of this to be the case. That's why he hasn't started flying Transatlantic yet. He hasn't been able to make it work on 
paper, so he has to wait for conditions to be right.<nl/> The announcement of board approval mentions that the 
airline is in talks with the aircraft manufacturers. The problem for Ryanair is finding an airplane that's fuel efficient 
enough without having to break the bank to buy the thing. That eliminates the gas-guzzling A340 on the used 
market. Ryanair is a much bigger fan of buying new and direct anyway. Could the A330neo be a good option? It 
sure could be. Or maybe the 787 or A350 is a good option. But Ryanair has to wait for demand to die down and the 
manufacturers to become hungrier. I'm sure the airline has a number in mind and it will wait until it can hit it, 
however long it may take.<nl/> The airplane you choose is one thing, but how you outfit it is equally important (if not 
more so). In the past, low cost carriers have tried to pack them in. Look at Cebu Pacific which puts 430+ seats on 
an A330. Some have tried a premium cabin but they're not very good. Norwegian has a premium economy-style 
premium cabin on its 787s[2], but that's not going to attract anyone with money to spend. It's also a small 
percentage of the airplane. That's really for the coach traveler who wants a bargain on something a bit better. It's 
still the leisure traveler that's the target market.<nl/> Air Asia X started moving in the right direction. It has angled 
flat beds on its A330s[3]. This isn't world class but with a price difference versus traditional competitors, it's worth 
If Anyone Will Make Low Cost Transatlantic Flying Work, It's Probably Ryanair
considering. But there are only 12 of these on the entire airplane. It's insignificant.<nl/> Ryanair knows there's great 
money to be made up front. Back in 2008, O'Leary gave his famous quote about the ideal premium cabin product… 
beds and blowjobs[4]. And he wants a bigger percentage of premium cabin seats on each airplane to help generate 
enough revenue, even with fares being so low compared to competitors in each cabin.<nl/> With a product like that 
at a lower price, Ryanair can attract more business travelers, which helps offset the big demand shifts. And since 
Ryanair has a huge presence in Europe with an increasingly business-oriented clientele, it can make inroads into a 
Transatlantic market better than some random upstart like La Compagnie[5].<nl/> In terms of routes, Ryanair wants 
to serve 12 to 14 cities on both sides of the Pond and then connect those dots. I would assume that the airline 
would try to leverage its existing passenger base and fly from its strong positions in Europe to larger cities in the 
US. That's been confirmed with Ryanair showing interest in places like London/Stansted and Berlin. But I've also 
seen mention of Berlin and Cologne. Those are much newer cities for the airline, but they are cities that Ryanair 
believes will provide growth within Europe. When flights start several years down the line, you can imagine these 
will be well-developed.<nl/> It will be interesting to see which cities get served in the US. Will Ryanair go toward 
bigger airports in popular places? There is a higher cost, but again, on longer flights that's a smaller percentage of 
the pie than on short haul. And people in Cologne want to go to New York, not Newburgh (or whatever airport it 
might want to consider). That doesn't mean it can't serve smaller airports, but with bigger airplanes on longer 
routes, it will need as much help as it can get to fill those seats.<nl/> Does this mean Ryanair will be successful? I 
wouldn't say that. But if anyone is going to crack this nut, there's a good chance it'll be Ryanair.<nl/> [Original

Mar 17, 2015( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Ireland's Ryanair 
has confirmed its resolve to get transatlantic flights off the ground within the next five years, including from Berlin. 
But for that it'll have to expand its fleet with suitable long-haul planes. The executive board of Irish no-frills airline 
Ryanair gave the green light for plans to start operating low-cost transatlantic routes in the next five years.<nl/> 
"The Guardian" and the "Financial Times" said Tuesday the carrier was aiming to include Dublin, London, Cologne 
and Berlin as its European bases for flights across the pond to New York, Boston and Washington.<nl/> "European 
consumers want lower-cost travel to the US and the same goes for Americans coming to Europe," Ryanair CEO 
Michael O'Leary said in a statement. "We see it as a logical development in the European market."<nl/> Fleet 
reshuffle<nl/> Ryanair said proposed transatlantic fares would start from as little as 10 pounds ($14, 13.2 euros) 
one-way, with regular prices close to 100 pounds per ticket.<nl/> But the airline will first have to talk to 
manufacturers about sourcing suitable long-haul aircraft.<nl/> "It's unclear how quickly Ryanair might be able to 
hold of enough aircraft, but it's hard to see the service operating before 2019-2020," "The Irish Times" 
commented.<nl/> Ryanair is Europe's largest carrier by passenger numbers and has forecast profits between 840-
850 million euros for its current fiscal year running until the end of the month.<nl/> hg/ng (AFP, Reuters)<nl/>

Irish airliner famous for its ridiculously cheap ticket prices[2] and lack of luggage space[3], announced Monday that 
the company's board has approved transatlantic flights. <nl/>The airline "would like to offer low cost flights between 
12-14 European cities and 12-14 US cities. The business plan is there but it's dependent on attaining viable long

confirmed that the flights to and from Europe would start at $10. <nl/>Michael O'Leary[4], CEO of Ryanair, has said 
for years[5] that the airline would offer cheap transatlantic flights as soon as theyacquired long-haul aircrafts[6].

Mar 16, 2015( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ;<nl/> Ireland's budget 
airline Ryanair is set to launch transatlantic flights — and they could cost as little as £10, the Guardian reports[1]. 
The company's board has approved plans to begin flights between up to 14 destinations in Europe and the US. 
It's part of a five-year strategy to continue growth.<nl/> Cities served would include New York, Boston, and Chicago 
stateside, the Guardian says, and London Stansted, Berlin, and Ryanair's native Dublin across the pond. The long 
haul addition to the company's flight offerings could come into operation in four or five years' time.<nl/> The airline 
has announced it is in talks with manufacturers over buying suitable aircraft for the venture — currently, it only 
carries out short to mid-length journeys, so would need much bigger planes to make the trip over the Atlantic. 
According the Guardian[2], Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has been trying to set up the service for some time. 
Indeed, the crossing is one of the more profitable routes in the world, though dominated largely by airlines such as 
British Airways and American Airlines right now.<nl/> Obviously, given the nature of Ryanair, which adds lots of 
extra costs to tickets, the £10 price tag will be much more once everything paid for. Food and drink, baggage fees, 
and other extras bump up the price. However, all things considered, The Telegraph estimates that a return fare 
would still cost just £185.20.[3] <nl/> That price is remarkably cheaper than other low-cost competitors flying over 
the Atlantic. Norwegian Air Shuttle runs flights from London Gatwick starting at about £300 — without 
baggage. <nl/>NOW WATCH: Amazing Animation Shows All Flights Over The World's Busiest Airport In 24

Germany's tourism market is well developed and mature, but the coming years still offer sufficient opportunities to 
make it an attractive proposition to established hotel groups. 
The coming introduction of the Holiday Inn Express and Premier Inn brands to the country show the belief of major 
worldwide hotel chains in the potential of the German budget hotel market size, which we anticipate will be an area 
of growth in the coming years due to falling airline prices encouraging price sensitive travellers to Germany. Due to 
improving economic conditions of neighbouring countries, government initiatives to encourage Asian Pacific 
travellers, and decreasing airline prices, we forecast a consistent rise in both inbound and outbound tourism from 
Germany, as well as a 27% rise in tourism receipts from 2015-2018, a final figure of USD 71.06bn. Threats to the 
industry include declining consumer confidence of both domestic and international households due to a potential 
economic downturn in Europe, and a deteriorating relationship between the EU and Russia over the Ukraine crisis 
leading to a decline in trade and tourism between Germany and Russia, Germany's 10th largest source 
market.<nl/>The movement of large brands such as Holiday Inn Express and Premier Inn into the German market 
shows the potential of the moderately priced market currently. This is the area we anticipate the most growth, due 
to an increasing amount of price-sensitive tourists being able to visit Germany due to increased consumer spending 
for households in neighbouring countries (such as the UK, Netherlands and Austria), and the decreasing prices of 
budget airlines due to increased competition between the airline companies.<nl/>Expanding airports in Berlin and 
Frankfurt will increase capacity, and budget airlines such as Ryanair, Wizz Air, and Easy Jet have pushed 
established players such as Lufthansa into increasing their low budget offerings, culminating in decreasing prices 
for the consumer and an increase in tourists. As Europe is the largest source market for inbound tourism to 
Germany, the potential for an economic downturn in the coming months is also a risk for the German tourism 
industry, such is the importance of the region to total receipts. Additionally, we see hotel developments and 
openings in Frankfurt of indicative of the driving force behind Germany's recent and future growth in tourism- as the 
largest financial centre in continental Europe, the city attracts large amount of business travellers as well as cultural 
tourists, and the city is prospering thanks to Germany's recent economic performance. <nl/><nl/>For more

Mar 13, 2015( IPKat Weblog: http://ipkitten.blogspot.com Delivered by Newstex) <nl/>

Forthcoming 
events. As usual, the IPKat urges readers to take a look at his Forthcoming Events [1]page and see if there are any 
upcoming IP events that take their fancy. Many are free or offer discounts to readers of this weblog. Among the 
events added this week are IBC's annual IT Law Summer School, which takes place in August in the agreeable 
surroundings of Downing College, Cambridge. The same company's annual IP Summer School will be held there 
too, and details will be posted as soon as they are available: this Kat will be running a coexistence agreement 
negotiation exercise at that event, which should be fun.<nl/>            http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-
WNpnmCN3Duo/VQLPVnW7OVI/AAAAAAAA4kM/uAz-kPUPSVo/s1600/ryan.jpgRyanair Chase. 
Listening to the radio yesterday, this Kat learned that there is an annual horse race, run on the third day of the 
Cheltenham Festival, which goes by the name of the Ryanair Chase[2]. Apparently there are 17 fences to be 
jumped and there is a generous prize of £200,000 [3]for the winner [though Merpel is quite puzzled as to what a 
horse might want with so large a sum of money, or indeed with any cash at all]. Having personally experienced the 
Ryanair brand at first hand, this Kat finds it difficult to whip up excitement for a race, or indeed anything else, that 
goes under that name. He has visions of air passengers being made to jump 17 fences on their way to a distant 
airline departure gate, and of jockeys being asked to pay a premium for a decent saddle. Since he has not flown 
Ryanair for a few years now, he wonders whether things have changed, and whether the brand now conjures up 
more positive images for its users than it did for him then. After all, the mere fact that Ryanair is paying out money 
rather than sucking it in can be taken as a positive sign. What do readers think?<nl/> http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-
NkVPmYqSqOs/VQKq7VJVhLI/AAAAAAAA4jE/UyUwU_hcTdU/s1600/jiplpgreen.gifLooking for a job? As the jiplp 
weblog reported earlier this week, IPKat blogmeister Jeremy, who is the founder editor of the Journal of Intellectual 
Property Law ...actice (JIPLP[4]) and has been toiling away at it since 2005, will be retiring from that role at the end 
of this year and the publisher, Oxford University Press (OUP), is already looking for someone to replace him. The 
job is a demanding one, but it's also fun: you get to correspond with leading IP personalities from around the world, 
you have a chance to read -- and edit -- loads of articles and current intelligence notes before anyone else gets to 
see them and you also have the thrill of working with OUP, one of the world's oldest brands and a stickler for quality 
control. Oh, and you also have the pleasure of working with several members of the IPKat blog squad (Eleonora, 
Darren, Birgit and Neil are all editorially involved). JIPLP comes out monthly; it is supported by a formal website, a 
weblog, a LinkedIn Discussion Group and a Twitter account. Supported by a hugely impressive editorial and 
production team, as one might expect from OUP, JIPLP comes out in print, online and in mobile-enabled format, 
Friday fantasies
and it is an increasingly influential voice in professional, commercial and academic circles. If you feel that you can 
take JIPLP to the next level and relish a truly satisfying challenge, you can get further details here[5]. But you'd 
better be quick: OUP wants to hear from you before the end of this month.<nl/>            http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-
cCexNUQEBak/VQL90Wx-6EI/AAAAAAAA4k8/wEuEIpvECik/s1600/aripi.pngAround the weblogs. The MARQUES 
Class 99 design blog reports, thanks to a guest post [6]from Evelina Marchesoni, on another Italian ruling on design 
rights in vehicle wheels, the difficult relationship between complex products and component parts and the role 
played by assessment of the aesthetic dimension of the effect of an allegedly infringing product: unlike the earlier 
Italian case involving wheel trims (Case C-500/14 Ford, here[7]), this one is not going to the Court of Justice for a 
preliminary ruling -- the court said so! Ben Challis has delivered another CopyKat copyright round-up, here[8], just 
in time for the weekend (thanks, Ben!) Meanwhile, PatLit has a short note [9]on what seems to be a bit of a non-
event: the report that summarises responses to the UK government's call for comments and consultation on what 
changes, if any, need to be made to the UK's Patents Act 1977 to make UK law compatible with the operation of 
Europe's new (but not yet operative) Unified Patent Court. Finally the patent term extension-oriented SPC Blog 
notes a ruling on Otsuka's failed attempt[10] to get a paediatric extension for aripiprazole on the ground that the 
Japanese pharma company had not met all the conditions for extension of the term before its supplementary 
protection 
certificate 
had 
already 
expired.<nl/> 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BbQJK--
Z7pA/VQK2x1KMBiI/AAAAAAAA4jo/v3EkT1BpHKg/s1600/ipho.pngNaughty OHIM! This Kat has noticed in the past 
that, while his good friends at the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) are getting very good at 
examining Community trade mark (CTM) applications, weeding out the not-so-registrable ones and generally 
running the CTM system smoothly, they do have their blind spots. One relates to the promotional material[11] which 
OHIM asked MARQUES out to prospective participants in its popular webinars on IP-related issues. The technical 
requirements for prospective participants are that they have "a computer or IPAD or IPHONE". This Kat is not 
impressed: does the fact that the words iPad and iPhone are in capital letters detract from the fact they are being 
used as generic terms for tablet computers and internet-enabled mobile phones respectively -- and who should 
know better than OHIM, which has granted CTMs to Apple for each of them (see eg Nos EU008817281 and 
004748133).<nl/>

GqOR9e48cgw/VQLxZFilChI/AAAAAAAA4ks/k5Coy6dcpgE/s1600/IMG_2804.jpgCongratulations! This Kat enjoyed 
the hospitality of Managing Intellectual Property magazine at this week's banquet at the Intercontinental Hotel, Park 
Lane, to mark the tenth anniversary of the Managing IP Global Awards. To his delight, one of this year's two awards 
for outstanding achievement went to former Court of Justice of the European Union and Irish Supreme Court judge 
Fidelma Macken[12], with whom he used to teach law at Trinity College, Dublin back in the 1970s. To his greater 
delight, this year's award for IP in Ireland went to DFMG Solicitors, for whom Patricia McGovern[13] was there to 
collect the trophy. Both Fidelma and Jeremy lectured Patricia at Trinity and were delighted to see that one of their 
star students had done so well. Incidentally, it was a good night for Ireland all round, since the other recipient of the 
outstanding achievement award went to Simmons ...mmons' Kevin Mooney[14] (though maybe it should have gone 
to Mrs Mooney after Kevin's kind words about her).<nl/> [ 1]:            http://ipkitten.blogspot.co.uk/p/for-your-

European cockpit colleagues cite cheapness concerns. Travel misery continues for Europe passengers amongst 
reports of possible negotiations.<nl/> There might be movement towards settling the current dispute.Sky interior, 
Norwegian plane Photo: Norwegian<nl/> 'The race to the bottom between airlines to set unsustainable terms and 
conditions should be fought at every opportunity,' the Ryanair Pilot Group (RPG) says in a statement.<nl/> 'The 
actions of NPU pilots operating for NAS to protect normal employment contracts and working conditions deserve 
the maximum support of every worker in Europe,' they add, citing a European Commission-funded report[5] into 
dumping and safety.<nl/> Norwegian Pilots Union aircrew working for Norwegian Air Shuttle through wholly-owned 
Scandinavia subsidiary Norwegian Air Norway (NAN) have been on strike since Saturday.<nl/> Wednesday saw 
industrial action widened. All domestic Norway flights were cancelled, some Sweden and Denmark domestic flights 
affected, and most inter-Scandinavian capitals flights cancelled. The strike hit some 35,000 passengers.<nl/> 'I'm 
not sure Norwegian realise what implications this [walkout] will have in the rest of the world,' Parat union leader 
Hans-Erik Skjæggerud told The Foreigner[6].<nl/> And while there has been some contact between them and 
Norwegian last night, the situation is much the same today, Thursday.<nl/> No domestic Norway routes are being 
flown, some Sweden and Denmark flights are affected, and most services between the Scandinavian capitals are 
cancelled.<nl/> Norwegian has been hiring in aircraft and pilots from other countries in efforts to provide some 
semblance of service, which unions view as strike-busting.<nl/> Talking of 'last resort industrial action', pilots at low-
cost carrier Ryanair say other airlines or NAS pilots in other countries should resist Norwegian's attempts to garner 
support to "the maximum extent legally possible".<nl/> 'The threat and risks associated with the employment 
models being adopted by NAS and other low-cost carriers are not acceptable in any modern industry, and we 
commend our colleagues in NPU for their efforts to secure normal employment contracts and working conditions,' 
they conclude.<nl/> According to NTB, Norwegian is now attempting to get the National Mediator (Riksmekleren)

http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RGQF8XEzWGo/VO71ZykrOuI/AAAAAAAAGUo/x01RFymcFAw/s1600/CJEU-
logo2.jpgCopyright has increasingly become linked to de-materialisation of both works and their exploitation 
channels, so it is kind of re-assuring to find cases that are still about the analogue world. <nl/> This morning the 
Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) issued in fact its decision [not yet available on the Curia website] in 
Case C-41/14 Christie's France[1], a reference for a preliminary ruling from France seeking clarification as regards 
that peculiar creature of EU copyright known as artist's resale right, or droit de suite [Merpel explains that this 
phrase does not mean right to a (hotel) suite, but rather the "right to follow" the sale of one's own 
artwork] within Directive 2001/84/EC[2] (the Resale Right Directive)<nl/>
 As this very blog reported[3] a few months ago, despite its appearance as a case concerned with a specialist (and 
possibly pretty niche) area of copyright, Christie's France is yet another CJEU decision dealing with the relationship 
between IP rights and contract law [to this end readers will promptly recall the very recent judgment in Ryanair[4], 
here[5]].<nl/> Background<nl/> Article 1 of the Resale Right Directive sets an obligation for Member States to 
provide for the benefit of the author of an original work of art an inalienable, unwaivable resale right. This consists of 
the right to receive a royalty based on the sale price obtained for any resale of the work, subsequent to the first 
transfer 
of 
the 
work 
by 
the 
author. <nl/>

rx43edmhUiQ/VO71okHUKPI/AAAAAAAAGUw/a0BijHnr7bY/s1600/paris-the-ritz-imperial-suite-marie-antoinette-
recreated-room.jpgArticle 1(4) further states that:<nl/> "The royalty shall be payable by the seller. Member States 
may provide that one of the natural or legal persons referred to in paragraph 2 [sellers, buyers or intermediaries art 
market professionals, such as salesrooms, art galleries and, in general, any dealers in works of art] other 
than [that's the important bit] the seller shall alone be liable or shall share liability with the seller for payment of the 
royalty."<nl/> Christie's France decided to change its terms and conditions so that the buyer, and not the seller, 
became liable to pay the royalty. The issue thus became: can a contract derogate from the seller's obligation to pay 
the royalty as is enshrined in the Directive? <nl/> The Syndicat National des Antiquaires (SNA) did not think so: it 
actually took the view that, in placing the onus of the resale royalty on the buyer, Christie's France's general 
conditions amounted to unfair competition. <nl/> Thus litigation ensued, and the Court of Cassation decided to stay 
the proceedings and seek guidance from the CJEU.<nl/> The following is the question that the French court 
referred to the CJEU:<nl/> "Must the rule laid down by Article 1(4) of Directive 2001/84/EC ... on the resale right for 
the benefit of the author of an original work of art, which makes the seller responsible for payment of the royalty, be 
BREAKING NEWS: CJEU says that Member States are free to determine who must pay droit de suite royalty
interpreted as meaning that the seller is required definitively to bear the cost thereof without any derogation by 
agreement's being possible?"<nl/> The CJEU decision As stated in the relevant press release[6], this morning the 
CJEU held that "[t]he cost of the royalty that has to be paid to the author on any resale of a work of art by an art 
market professional may be borne, definitively, by the seller or the buyer".<nl/>            http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-
USQK-WNOINY/VO72KsP16MI/AAAAAAAAGU4/M7vyi_o9pDo/s1600/flat%2C550x550%2C075%2Cf.jpg 
According to the Court, <nl/> "[T]he Member States alone may determine the person liable for the royalty. Although 
Directive 2001/84 provides that the person by whom the royalty is payable is, in principle, the seller, it none the less 
allows for a derogation from that rule and thus leaves the Member States at liberty to specify another person from 
among the professional persons referred to in the Directive who, alone or with the seller, will assume liability for the 
payment of the royalty. The person who has been designated in that way by national law as the person by whom 
the royalty is payable may agree with any other person, including the buyer, that that other person will definitively 
bear, in whole or in part, the cost of the royalty, provided that acontractual arrangement of that kind does not affect 
the obligations and liability which the person by whom the royalty is payable has towards the author ... [S]uch a 
derogation is in keeping with the Directive's objective of bringing to an end distortions of competition in the art 
market, since the harmonisation concerned is limited to those domestic provisions which have the most direct 
impact on the functioning of the internal market. For the purpose of achieving that objective, thus circumscribed, it is 
necessary to make provision as to the person liable for payment of the royalty and as to the rules for establishing 
the amount of the royalty. However, such provision is not necessary with regard to the question as to 
who, definitively, will bear the cost of the royalty.<nl/>The Court does not exclude the possibility that such a 
derogation may to some extent have a distorting effect on the functioning of the internal market. However, such an 
effect is only indirect since it arises as a result of contractual arrangements that are independent of the payment of 
the royalty to the author, for which the person by whom the royalty is payable remains liable."<nl/><nl/>A more 
detailed analysis will follow as soon as the judgment becomes available, so: stay tuned!<nl/> [ 1]:

Feb 16, 2015( The 1709 Blog: http://the1709blog.blogspot.com Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Here's a guest post 
from Valentina Torelli on a legal decision from Italy that has attracted a good deal of attention beyond that lovely 
country's 
borders. 
This 
is 
what 
she 
says:<nl/> 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-
xN3fO2YoZag/VOHhdpGYsnI/AAAAAAAA31A/YrQixEM-uvk/s1600/holly.jpgA week ago, the IPKat reported[1]a 
fascinating judgment of the Court of Milan concerning the infringement of Audrey Hepburn's publicity right by the 
Italian company Caleffi[2]. As explained, the Court of Milan admitted Audrey Hepburn's heirs' claim that Caleffi pay 
compensatory damages and restore moral prejudice for having deployed Audrey Hepburn's image in Breakfast at 
Tiffany's on postcards and brochures, without authorisation, within the contest called 'il diamante dei sogni' (the 
diamond of dreams). This advertising material featured on Caleffi's website and as part of an advertising insert of a 
well-known Italian magazine. In particular, Audrey Hepburn's heirs argued that her right of publicity was infringed 
under Article 96 of the Italian Copyright Law and Article 10 of the Italian Civil Code. 
The first provision establishes that a person's portrait cannot be displayed, reproduced or put in the market without 
the person's consent - or the heir's consent - unless the requirements of Article 97 are met: among others, the 
celebrity status of the person justifies the lack of consent when the image's reproduction refers to facts, events, 
ceremonies of public interest and when the reproduction of the image took place in public circumstances. In any 
event, the portrayal's display and commercialisation are forbidden when they hinder the reputation, the honour and 
the dignity of the person concerned. Likewise, Article 10 of the Italian Civil Code grants physical persons the right to 
ask for the cessation of the unlawful display or publication of their portrayal and for compensation in the form of 
damages, when such uses occurred outside the cases provided by the law or when the person's dignity and 
reputation are impaired. The Court of Milan first held that Article 96 and 97 of the Copyright Law could not resolve 
the dispute in that the alleged breach did not encompass Audrey Hepburn's real image. The Court then applied 
Article 10 of the Italian Civil Code, as the present case entailed the rearrangement of the famous window-shopping 
scene in Breakfast at Tiffany's where Holly (alias Audrey Hepburn) was looking at Tiffany's showcase. The 
photographer of the advertisement depicted, partially from behind, a model in a black dress, with lookalike Holly 
hairstyle, with black gloves and sparkling jewellery while posing in front of a shop showcase. All these 
circumstances were enough for the Court to find that there had been an undue association between the 
photography's narrative subject matter and Audrey Hepburn's image, although that image only evoked her 'Holly' 
character. In allowing the claim, the Court of Milan applied old settled case law dating back to 1984, 1992 and 1997, 
which had extended the physical person's right to portrayal to elements not directly connected to that person such 
as clothing, decoration, make-up. The Court however considered that the Hepburn/Holly persona was a public 
Seeing stars! Some reflections on Audrey Hepburn v Caleffi
person in the audience's perception, this being an evocative reference which required a request for consent to use 
the person's image.From a legal and photographic point of view, I am not completely sure that the Court of Milan 
got it right in this case in that, when I first read the judgment, I immediately wondered whether the judges had 
confused Audrey Hepburn's and Holly's images, despite how much the public may hold the actress performance in 
Breakfast at Tiffany's in high esteem. As regards the legal perspective, the Holly character originated from Truman 
Capote's creativity and it was later envisaged and adapted in an audiovisual work under Blake Edward's direction. 
Within the cinematographic conception of Holly a considerable degree of recognition should be accorded to Mr 
Hubert de Givenchy, the fashion designer who shaped Audrey Hepburn's image in and out of movie sets. Overall, 
Holly's features derive from the commitment of all these great professionals in the realisation of the Breakfast at 
Tiffany's masterpiece, produced by Jurow-Shepherd. That said, it would have been different if Audrey Hepburn's 
image had been used in Caleffi's advertisement, as happened[3]in Ryanair's campaign in which one of Charles 
Prince of Wales' photographs had been used without authorisation to sponsor the suitability of its air fares. In its 
decision of 3 March 2004 the Advertising Standard Authority[4] censured the advertisement in that it infringed the 
Prince's right to privacy because the Royal Family's permission to use the photograph had not been requested 
according 
to 
Article 
13 
of 
the 
Code 
of 
Advertising 
Practice. 
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-
t0wZYB1jBMc/VOHhtzQvTeI/AAAAAAAA31I/HOIjWiKAv7E/s1600/dalla.jpgThe Audrey Hepburn case was also 
different from that involving the legendary Italian songwriter Lucio Dalla[5], to which the Court of Milan referred. In 
Dallathe advertiser had used elements which delineated Dalla (left) by reference to symbols that typified him, 
namely a knitted hat skullcap and a pair of metal-framed spectacles. However, those features belonged to Dalla as 
a physical person who had also a public recognition and fame. In the Audrey Hepburn dispute, should there be any 
infringement of a right to the portrayal of Holly? Who is the holder of Holly character's image? Is there any right of 
portrayal available for fictional characters? Eventually, these questions could be answered by reference to the 
Italian Copyright Law, in particular to Article 46ff concerning copyright and related rights in cinematographic 
works. In relation to photography, there are a couple of consideration to highlight. First, it could be argued that the 
photographer's work in Caleffi's advertisement was an original photography and a piece of art on its own, since its 
suggestive subject matter did not conclusively deprive the image of copyright protection, the author's own creation 
could be found in the form of a minimum of reinterpretation of the window-shopping scene. I have found the case-
law on which the Court of Milan relied to assess the misuse of Audrey Hepburn's image quite outdated. All in all, I 
think that the way the people's image should be treated and protected should reflect the conditions of society today 
and that images should be treated in accordance with the role that society assigns to them. Since the judgments 
referred to in the present case were given, more than 20 years have passed and our society has evolved into one 
that recognises the wisdom of communication inspired and managed by images. We are driven to make our 
choices and to think about everything in terms of images and photographs, without stopping to think about what a 
photograph actually represents. Photography, advertising photography included, is more than a true and simple 
reproduction of someone or something: they are now often the means by which a story is told and sometimes they 
are also works of art on their own, like Elliott Erwitt[6]'s photography for example. Hubert de Givenchy here[7]Lucio

Europe's Airlines Race for Wi-Fi in Battle for Flyers, Profits
Europe's Airlines Race for Wi-Fi in Battle for Flyers, Profits

Feb 16, 2015( Voice of America: http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex) ; Europe's airlines are racing to 
add Wi-Fi to their planes, eager to attract Internet-hungry customers in a cut-throat short-haul market and 
potentially add millions of dollars of revenue through entertainment, services and advertising. U.S. airline 
passengers already have a chance of accessing Wi-Fi on 66 percent of miles flown, against a worldwide average of 
24 percent, according to data from Routehappy, which rates flights worldwide on amenities such as seats and 
entertainment.
 In Europe, adoption of a ground-to-air service such as that in the United States, is harder due to the number of 
countries in the region, while satellite-based services have been too costly for short flights. But with more satellites 
being sent up, bringing costs down, and airlines more aware of the money-making possibilities, price is no longer 
such a stumbling block, industry watchers say. Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, Ryanair and Vueling are some of the 
major European carriers looking at on-board Wi-Fi on short-haul flights, following low-cost carrier Norwegian, which 
offers it for free on 74 of its 76 Boeing 737s. As well as potentially charging passengers to stream TV shows and 
music on their mobile devices during flights of a couple of hours or less, airlines can use onboard connectivity to 
offer restaurant bookings, shopping or hotel offers in conjunction with advertisers and partners. 'Nowhere else in the 
world do you get that captive audience where you know everything about the people that got on the plane and what 
kind of advertisements you should offer them,' said Robin Cole, Vice-President Global Business Development at 
Global Eagle Entertainment, which provides satellite-based Wi-Fi for airlines Norwegian and Southwest. Global 
Eagle is due to trial a fee-paying system on two Air France A320s this summer in conjunction with mobile firm 
Orange, and believes the retail and sponsorship opportunities of onboard Wi-Fi could boost industry revenues by 
hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Becoming basic need The revenue opportunities are attracting attention 
across the European industry, with low-cost carriers particularly quick to move, said AT Kearney consultant Rene 
Steinhaus. 'There's a huge logic to having Wi-Fi on board, even in Europe,' he said. Ryanair will use advertising or 
other revenue streams to ensure Wi-Fi access doesn't add to its costs, CEO Michael O'Leary said, adding it had 
begun talks with mobile phone companies over charges, and with technical companies over fitting the lightest 
possible aerials for the lowest cost. In the United States, moves by low-cost carriers such as JetBlue to offer basic 
onboard Wi-Fi services for free were putting pressure on mainline carriers, Routehappy data research manager 
Jason Rabinowitz said. Britain's Inmarsat, which partners with Honeywell to offer Internet onboard using its 
satellites and the U.S. company's hardware, currently has over a 9 percent share of the commercial cabin 
connectivity market. 'It's growing faster than anything else in the space that I can think of. Almost every airline in the

Global ATC equipment market paves way for high-value passenger aircrafts to receive VIP landing treatment
Global ATC equipment market paves way for high-value passenger aircrafts

<nl/> The global air traffic control (ATC) equipment market is expected to change the way that air traffic controllers 
treat different aircrafts, based on the value of passengers inside. 
Recent technological advancements allow air traffic controllers to more clearly predict the exact location of multiple 
aircrafts at one time, through use of so-called '4D trajectory'. 4D trajectory technology relies on new developments 
in the global ATC equipment market, such as advanced infrared cameras and sensor solutions.<nl/>As airports 
across the world see rapid rises in the number of passengers they carry each year, in combination with increased 
aircraft movement, the global ATC equipment market is forecast to total around US$5.5bn by 2020, with expected 
growth rates reaching a CAGR of 5% from 2014 to 2020. Thanks to advancements in the global ATC equipment 
market there will be a great deal more commercial applications that can be developed by air traffic controllers in the 
UK.<nl/>If the 4D trajectory technology is successfully introduced then this will have great implications on all of the 
UK's airports and airlines. For example, airlines that regularly have more premium seating in their aircrafts can be 
expected to benefit from this new system. However, lower value airlines, such as easyJet and Ryanair, may see 
their traffic priority level reduced as premium airlines pay for quicker landing.<nl/>"Why not have a virtual tower in a 
regional centre where the controller can see and control everything with remote technology, sensors and infrared 
cameras?" said Richard Deakin, chief executive of the National Air Traffic Service (Nats). "It might tell the controller 
how many passengers need to make a connecting flight. The controller can then make more informed decisions, 
perhaps giving it extra priority to make sure the passengers definitely make their connections.And the commercial 
applications become obvious - tiered or premium services giving priority to frequent flyers, loyal customers and 
high-value customers."<nl/>Although the global ATC equipment market is projected to see a relatively strong 
growth rate in the future, even market leaders like US-based Lockheed Martin Corp, Raytheon Company and 
Northrop Grumman, are expected to face challenges as ATC equipment prices rise, with maintenance fees 
remaining high. However, market players can be optimistic at the fact that global air traffic is forecast to almost 
double by 2030 and because more new airports are being constructed, with existing airports being modernised at a 
high rate.<nl/>For more information on the global air traffic control (ATC) equipment market, see the latest market

Cockpit union announces pilots' strike on Germanwings
Cockpit union announces pilots' strike on Germanwings

Feb 10, 2015( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Members of the 
Cockpit trade union will not fly or work for Lufthansa's low-cost subsidiary Germanwings on Thursday or Friday. 
It's the latest strike in a labor dispute with Lufthansa lasting months. Cockpit announced on Tuesday evening that 
its members working for Germanwings would down tools on Thursday and Friday, the latest pilots' strike in a 
months-long dispute between flagship carrier Lufthansa and the trade union.<nl/> All Germanwings flights departing 
from German airports during the 48-hour period would be affected, Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) said, adding that its 
most recent attempts to mediate had failed earlier this week.<nl/> "With this, Lufthansa again documents its lack of 
willingness to strike a deal, causing further strikes," VC spokesman Jörg Handwerg said. Tuesday's statement on 
the Cockpit website also claimed that Lufthansa's latest proposals planned for "a clear deterioration, or even 
abolition, of transitional support for young pilots," calling this "unacceptable for VC."<nl/> One key area of 
disagreement in the labor dispute is the terms of retirement for Lufthansa pilots, with the carrier seeking to increase 
the age at which pilots qualify to take early retirement. The union has also balked at future plans to provide no early 
retirement option for newly-hired pilots.<nl/> Lufthansa's main airline faced a string of similar strikes in 2014, 
peaking with two walkouts in the space of a week last December. Back in October, the airline claimed that the 2014 
strikes to date had cost it roughly 160 million euros ($181 million). A trade union for pilots and flight engineers, 
Cockpit has roughly 9,300 members.<nl/> The influence of Cockpit, and train drivers' union GDL, in a series of 
pulic-transport-related strikes in Germany last year has prompted the government in Berlin to seek new legislation 
limiting the powers of smaller, niche trade unions. A draft bill, seeking to make deals struck with larger unions 
applicable to all employees, is due for parliamentary debate this year.<nl/> Germanwings, and regional budget 
airline Eurowings, have become key arrows in the Lufthansa quiver as the airline seeks to manage competition from 
European low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and EasyJet, and from Gulf operators like Emirates, Etihad and Qatar 
on lucrative long-haul routes.<nl/> In a separate strike on Monday run by trade union Verdi, security staff at airports 
in Hamburg, Stuttgart and Hanover downed tools as part of a pay dispute. Hamburg's airport was temporarily forced 
to shut its terminal building to combat overcrowding.<nl/> msh/bw (AFP, Reuters, dpa)<nl/>

Valentine's Day quickly approaching, is there anything better than to think of our love (or, rather: hate?) for EU 
copyright?
<nl/> Notoriously this has become an area in which things happen more quickly than when falling in love at first 
sight.<nl/> Since the beginning of this year (so not long time ago!), the Court of Justice of the European Union 
(CJEU) has already issued a number of topical decisions, which have touched upon:<nl/>The relationship between 
copyright, databases, and contractual freedom (Ryanair[1]);<nl/>The circumstances which give rise to the 
exhaustion of the right of the copyright owner to control further distribution of his/her work under the InfoSoc 
Directive, including such topical questions as: does this directive envisage digital exhaustion? (Art 
...lposters[2]);<nl/>Whether there is such thing as a general EU right of adaptation (does it matter?) (Art 
...lposters[3]);<nl/>Jurisdiction in alleged online copyright infringement cases (Hejduk[4]).<nl/>On 5 March the 
CJEU will also deliver its much-awaited ruling in Copydan[5]. This is a case which hopefully will shed some further 
light on the private copying exception in Directive 2001/29[6] (the InfoSoc Directive), including levies and ... their 
lack thereof. The latter will be relevant to understanding better the new UK exception for personal copies for private 
use (currently subject to judicial review[7]), notably its lack of levies. Is the UK move compatible with EU law?<nl/> 
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XftQMJs6N3s/VNiQTw1uU2I/AAAAAAAAGSc/Lb6i1c0KADE/s1600/1920x1200-red.jpgIn 
parallel to judicial activity, the new Commission has already announced[8] a major overhaul of EU copyright 
architecture, and the European Parliament has asked Pirate Party MEP Julia Reda to review[9] the implementation 
of the InfoSoc Directive and advise on how it could be reformed.<nl/> It is thus clear that there is currently a lot 
going on in the area of everybody's favourite IP right, at both the EU judicial and policy levels. This 3-hour 'EU 
Copyright, I Love You' event on Wednesday 11 March from 2 to 5 pm shall review such developments.<nl/> Places 
are limited (with some tickets available for full time students), so to provide everybody with the opportunity to

Feb 03, 2015( The Daily Dot: http://www.dailydot.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ;<nl/> Working ground crew at the 
airport[1] is a thankless job, to say the least. So it's easy to see why the ground crew at the Dublin airport might 
want to blow off a little steam. <nl/>
Last Friday evening, a Ryanair[2] flight crew decided to relieve some stress by creating a magnificent work of art. 
So they crafted a gigantic, curved snow dong, pointing right at the passengers waiting to board their flight. <nl/> The 
sight of the snow sculpture caught passenger Brendan Keary[3] so off guard that he snapped a photo and posted it 
to Twitter. The frosty phallus quickly gained traction online, and soon the photo caught the attention of Ryanair 
representatives. Rather than attempt to apologize for the crude drawing, the company decided to get creative with 
its response. A spokesman for Ryanair told the [4]Telegraph[5]: 'While our ground crew excel at industry leading 
25-minute turnarounds, art isn't their forte, as they've clearly forgotten to draw wings on their snow 
airplane.'<nl/>Well

Feb 04, 2015( Shanghaiist: http://www.gothamist.com/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Shanghai-based low-budget 
carrier Spring Airlines is once again trying to approve plans to offer cut-price tickets to passengers willing to stand 
up on flights. <nl/>
<nl/>The airline mulled over the idea back in 2008[1] as a way to accommodate more passengers over the Spring 
Festival holiday rush. Having passengers standing upright would increase capacity by around 40 percent, the airline 
said. The scheme never really took off (da-dum), however, as aviation authorities raised concerns over safety 
issues. <nl/><nl/>On Tuesday, a spokesman for Spring told China National Radio that it was still hoping to offer the 
service[2]. 'We need many other conditions to make it work, like working together with airplane manufacturers, 
getting the approval from the authorities and having the consumers accept the idea," he said.<nl/><nl/> 
<nl/><nl/>Passengers would still be strapped in during takeoff and landing, Spring Airlines president Wang 
Zhenghua previously told news reporters. "The safety belt is the most important thing," he said. "It will still be 
fastened around the waist."<nl/><nl/>Dublin-based low-cost airline Ryanair also showed interest in upright seats, 
and its CEO Michael O'Leary seems to think there is no need for the seatbelts at all.<nl/><nl/>"[A plane is] just a b--
--- bus with wings', he said[3]. 'If there ever was a crash on an aircraft, God forbid, a seatbelt won't save you. You 
don't need a seatbelt on the London Underground. You don't need a seatbelt on trains which are traveling at 
120mph and if they crash you're all dead..." <nl/><nl/>Remember those words of comfort should ever find yourself 
strapped into one of these babies.<nl/><nl/> <nl/><nl/>(This is the design of a Skyrider "saddle" seat, released by

Feb 04, 2015( PandoDaily: http://pandodaily.com Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> What do Facebook, AirBnB, Spotify, 
Groupon, Evernote, Soundcloud, Booking.com, Yelp, RyanAir, KLM, and Abercrombie ...tch have in common? No, 
it's not a trick questions. Other than each being worth (in come cases many tens of) billions of dollars, they are all 
among the 3,500 global merchants to process online payments using Adyen[1], an Amsterdam-based payments 
platform that facilitated $25 billion in transactions in 2014. And as of yesterday, they are all now just the flip of a 
switch away from accepting bitcoin payments, thanks to a partnership between Adyen and Atlanta-based BitPay[2]. 
The deal is major news for the bitcoin ecosystem, which is fighting to establish global ubiquity and trust with regard 
to its digital, cryptology-based payment protocol. 
If any of the above giants were to choose to accept bitcoin, joining existing adoptees like Dell, Microsoft, 
Expedia.com, Overstock.com, TigerDirect, WordPress, and Virgin Galactic, it would surely drive both legitimacy and 
adoption. Bitpay has been adopted by more than 53,000 merchants, while Coinbase, its main competitor on the 
merchant payments front, has been adopted by 38,000. Collectively, more than 100,000 merchants are believed to 
accept bitcoin around the globe. The first Adyen client to begin accepting bitcoin is UK-based Jagex[3], creators of 
RuneScape[4], a popular mobile and online game, according to a blog post[5] by Bitpay. The company writes: 
Through the integration each merchant's bitcoin sales will be seamlessly included in their reporting and settlement 
from Adyen. These are the types of integrations needed to advance bitcoin. Merchants choosing Adyen and BitPay 
will receive all the advantages of working with a stable, scalable payments platform. Adyen is a great company, and 
a strong partner, to help expand bitcoin adoption worldwide. Jagex has a history of being an early adopter of new 
payments technologies and business models, including being among the pioneers of the now ubiquitous free-to-
play gaming model supported by in-app purchases. Jagex Payment Services Director David Parrott said in a 
statement: An advantage of bitcoin is that it is still new and shiny enough to generate interest in the payment 
experience simply through the fact that it exists. There are people with investment in the system, looking for new 
and cool places to spend their cash. As a business that operates on a freemium model - where the payment 
process needs to be compelling enough to convert cost free customers into paying ones - not having a barrier to 
entry for bitcoin users makes sense. Adyen, which supports 180 currencies and over 250 payment methods, was 
founded in 2006 and completed a $250 million Series B round led by General Atlantic in December, valuing the 
company at a reported $1.5 billion. BitPay has raised $32.5 million to date from investors that include TTV 
Capital, Felicis Ventures, Founders Fund, Horizons Ventures, Jerry Yang, Richard Branson, Barry Silbert, and 
Roger Ver. Adyen joins many of the world's largest payment processors in enabling bitcoin payments for their 
Euro-payment giant Adyen integrates BitPay , offers Facebook and Spotify one-click bitcoin acceptance
customers, including Stripe, Braintree, PayPal, and Square, typically through partnerships with either (or both) 
BitPay or Coinbase. The benefit for merchants of these partnerships is that they mean no additional technical 
integrations are required to begin accepting bitcoin. Typically all that's required is the flip of a switch in their 
payments platform administrative panel and the creation of a respective bitcoin wallet account. This is much simpler 
that requiring merchants to integrate BitPay or Coinbase APIs into their existing technology stack, regardless of 
how easy such integrations may be. While this partnership between BitPay and Adyen is no doubt good news for 
bitcoin in the grand scheme of things, it's unlikely to boost prices considerably and instead could put further 
downward pressure in the near- to mid-term. The unfortunate reality is that most merchants accepting bitcoin today 
elect to immediately convert these incoming virtual payments into fiat currency, thus increasing the sell-side activity 
in the marketplace. Longer term, however, as bitcoin adoption grows among merchants, their suppliers and 
vendors, and even their employees, it's more likely that companies will consider retaining some or all of their 
incoming bitcoin payments and using them in the normal course of business. Similarly, as more merchants accept 
bitcoin, consumers will have more reason to acquire and hold the virtual currency. It will likely take time and 
increased confidence in the long term viability of bitcoin as a payment tool, not to mention relative stability in its 
value. After a year in which bitcoin prices plummeted more than 50 percent[6] in 2014 on a bevy of negative news 
and regulatory uncertainty, the headlines in 2015 have been largely positive; prices, however, have continued to 
decline[7]. In the first month of the year alone the industry saw its largest ever venture round[8], the launch of its 
first regulated exchange[9] (with plans for more[10]), and PayPal subsidiary Braintree enabling online and in-app 
bitcoin payments[11] for its network of thousands of merchants, including, Uber, AirBnB, and HotelTonight. On the 
flip side, a high profile exchange hack[12] and the trial of accused Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht[13] have 
weighed on sentiment. Bitcoin's price is hardly the only measure of its viability. Adoption by merchants and 
consumers is another strong indicator, as are regulatory approval, venture investment, and new company formation 
within the sector. As many industry experts like Mark Andreessen* have argued, price volatility is no surprise and in 
fact was a necessary and deliberate element of the bitcoin system design, meant to drive speculative adoption and 
early growth. Moreover, Andreessen argued in a state of bitcoin[14] tweetstorm to begin the year that many of the 
most interesting applications for bitcoin and its underlying blockchain are price and volatility independent: 23/The 
price of BTC has very little to do with the level of creativity of thinking that's going into new Bitcoin apps, or their 
usefulness. — Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) January 5, 2015[15] One thing of note in this Facebook-related news 
is that the social networking giant recently poached two senior executives from PayPal, including its former CEO 
David Marcus and VP of Growth Stan Chudnovsky. The two are currently working on Facebook's Messenger 
product, which has recently seen competitors like WeChat[16], Snapchat[17], and Line[18] add payment 
functionality. It's hardly a stretch to think that Marcus and Chudnovsky could be cooking up a similar offering from 
PayPal, and now bitcoin is one step closer to being supported under such a scenario. When Braintree finally turned 
on bitcoin functionality for its merchants, the big question everyone wanted answered was, when would sharing 
economy giants Uber and AirBnB begin accepting the virtual currency? Today, it only seems fair to turn the 
spotlight to Facebook, Spotify, and their ilk. How about it, Zuck and Ek? (*Disclosure: Marc Andreessen is an

Feb 02, 2015( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Europe's largest 
budget carrier, Ireland's Ryanair, has revised upward its full-year profit outlook for the third time within a few 
months. 
The airline is thriving on reduced costs and higher passenger numbers. Irish no-frills carrier Ryanair said Monday it 
expected its profit for the year ending March to come in at between 840 million euros ($949 million) and 850 million 
euros.<nl/> It was the third time within a few months that the airline had upped its full-year earnings outlook, citing 
reduced operating costs and rising passenger numbers.<nl/> Ryanair hastened to add, though, that expectations 
for 2016 were rater limited, considering continuously shrinking ticket prices.<nl/> The low-budget carrier booked 49 
million euros in net profit for the third quarter, bouncing back from a 35-million-euros loss in the same period a year 
earlier. Revenue rose by 17 percent to total 1.13 billion euros.<nl/> Feeding passengers<nl/> In the not-too-distant 
future, Ryanair hopes to profit further from its current expansion into larger airports with a view to winning market 
share from legacy carriers such as British Airways, Air France-KLM and Lufthansa.<nl/> The Irish airline had said 
those carriers would use low-cost airlines more to feed people onto their long-haul routes.<nl/> "If you go forward in 
Europe in the next five or 10 years, I think low-cost carriers, mostly ourselves and easyJet, will do a lot more 
feeding of major airlines," Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement. He said the days were numbered for 
how much longer national flag carriers could operate intra-European flights because it was too expensive for them 
to compete on those point-to-point routes.<nl/> hg/pad (dpa, Reuters)<nl/>

Feb 02, 2015( CompaniesandMarkets.com News: http://www.companiesandmarkets.com/ Delivered by Newstex) 
<nl/> Despite the falling oil price helping airlines to cut costs, the UK aviation market faces turbulent times as major 
players battle over limited airport capacity and growing numbers of passengers. <nl/>
Ryanair today released a report that it has raised its guidance for full-year net profits from between EU810 million 
and EU830 million to a range of EU840 million to EU850 million. The airline expects a 25% increase in the first 
three months of 2015, despite the falling oil prices offering more benefits to its competitors after Ryanair hedged its 
oil prices at $92 a barrel. <nl/>Ryanair has a 29% stake in Aer Lingus, the Irish airline which is the subject of a 
EU1.4 billion takeover bid by British Airways' owner IAG. IAG's interest in Aer LIngus is primarily in its 23 pairs of 
take-off and landing slots at Heathrow Airport, valued at around £30 million each. Despite plans to run Aer Lingus 
as a separate business with its own brand, management and operations, the Irish government, which holds a 
25.1% stake in the airline, fear that a takeover would jeopardise the Irish business and tourism industries by 
reducing flights to Ireland from London as IAG choose to use those landing slots instead for their big money-making 
long-haul flights. The Irish government sees few benefits in the prospect of a takeover; not only would the risk of 
reduced flights between London and Dublin damage Irish business potential, but the acquisition would see the loss 
of 1,200 Irish jobs. Further, the only potential benefit of the acquisition of better prices for new aircraft, has already 
been acquired through a combined orders agreement with Ethiad Airways. <nl/>The Aer Lingus takeover would 
face competition concerns from European regulators since Aer Lingus is the 4th largest operator at Heathrow 
Airport after British Airways, Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic. The merger of BA and Iberia in 2011 created the 
International Airlines Group (IAG) which currently has 430 aircraft and more than 60,000 employees. 
<nl/>Alongside this fierce UK aviation competition, large airline companies from the east are trying to increase their 
westerly presence and service. Qatar Airways recently bought a 10% stake in BA worth £1.15 billion and providing 
Qatar with closer links to the IAG group which has two major European hubs, including London, and a strong 
transatlantic network. Qatar has a strong presence in Southeast Asia, India and the Middle East, owning more than 
130 aircraft with a further 340 on order. Its main competitors in the Asian market are Emirates, based in Dubai and 
Etihad, based in Abu Dhabi but it is now looking to expand in the west. Here it still faces stiff competition in terms of 
size from the UK giants: Doha-based Qatar had 22 million passengers in the 2013-2014 financial year, whilst IAG 
carried over 77 million passengers in 2014. <nl/>A rise in the number of passengers, commercial flights and cargo 
is driving the UK aviation market, maintaining strong growth. Falling oil prices are helping airlines to cut costs but 
airport capacity is majorly constricting the growth of the aviation market. Limited capacity alongside increased 
numbers of passengers leads to flight delays and disruptions and increased competitions between airlines for 
offering the most and the best flights. <nl/>Read the latest report: UK Aviation Market[1]<nl/> <nl/>Follow us on

Jan 29, 2015( Laurence Kaye on Digital Media Law: http://laurencekaye.typepad.com/laurence_kayes_blog/ 
Delivered by Newstex)  Dear reader Apologies for the rather cryptic title of this post which concerns this month's 
decision[1] of the European Court of Justice in Ryanair Ltd vs PR Aviation BV. This goes back to 2010 and 
Ryanair's complaint to a Dutch Court about PR Aviation 'scrapping' the Ryanair database. PR Aviation operate a 
price comparison and booking site for flights, for which purpose it scraped data from the Ryanair website. The case 
illustrates that in an age of 'machine to machine' communications, contracts and licences may trump intellectual 
property rights. Ryanair argued before the Dutch Court that (1) PR Aviation's webscraping infringed its copyright 
and/or database right (also known as the) derived from the Directive for the Legal Protection of Databases[2] and 
(2) that PR Aviation also breached the terms of Ryanair's website which state that "the use of automated systems 
or software to extract data from this website or            www.bookryanair.com[3] for commercial purposes ('screen 
scraping') is prohibited unless the third party has directly concluded a written licence agreement with Ryanair...."
 In fact, Ryanair lost on (1) before the Dutch Courts which decided that the scrapped data did not benefit from 
copyright protection under the Database Directive, nor did it meet the 'substantial investment' test under that 
Directive to qualify for the database right protection. The single issue decided by the CJEU was whether the 
freedom to use such a database can be controlled by contract or whether freedom to contract is overriden by the 
Direcctive. The Database Directive gives the 'lawful user' of a database the right to use substantial parts of a 
database without requiring the consent of the owner for specified purposes, and thus without infringing either the 
copyright or database right. For example, the 'lawful user' can extract or re-utilise the database's contents without 
requiring consent i.e do the things.... " which is necessary for the purposes of access to the contents of the 
databases and normal use of the database"."  The Directive goes on to state that any contractual provision which 
overrides these 'carve outs' to copyright and database right are null and void. The point decided by the CJEU was 
this: as the Ryanair dataset scraped by PR Aviation's search engine was not protected by copyright or database 
right - because it did not meet the thresshold for legal protection - the provisions in the Database Directive which 
rendered null and void contractual limitations on the 'lawful user's' right to use the database did not apply. So the 
result is that freedom to contract wins on issue (2) - The restriction in Ryanair's website terms against web scraping 
were not overriden nor rendered null and void by the Database Directive. This decision may be significant as we 
move increasingly to the use of 'machine readable' permissions (aka licence terms) which attach the use of content 
and effectively 'travel with' that content, thereby communicating the ways in which that content may be lawfully 
Rights in databases: IP rights 0: Contracts 1
used. That's actually good news because in a world of digital distribution, it's in everyone's interests to use 
technology to make it easy to find, clear and use content.  In my view, this doesn't mean that rights owners will or 
can use contracts to 'lock up' content - bear in mind this decision relates only to data in a database and not to to 
copyright content sitting in databases, Rights owners don't want to 'lock up' content. Rather, they make it available 
across a multitude of platforms but on terms that where it is protected by copyright, there is an infrastructure in 
place which delivers that content to consumers and assures rights holders, from creators onwards, that they get 
remunerated where they of a fair return on their creative and economic investment. There's a good analysis of the

given the nod to the takeover offer from IAG - its third proposal in six weeks. 
The Irish airline now needs to calm government concerns to win shareholder approval. Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus 
announced on Tuesday that it backs a 1.36-billion-euro ($1.52 billion) takeover bid by International Airlines Group 
(IAG), parent of British Airways and Spain's Iberia.<nl/> The news comes one day after IAG had submitted a third 
takeover offer worth 2.55 euros per share, with 2.50 euros in cash and a dividend of 0.05 euros per share.<nl/> The 
Dublin-based airline said its 11-member board was "willing to recommend" IAG's improved proposal, subject to 
being satisfied with how the group proposes to address the interests of relevant parties including its top 
shareholders - rival budget airline Ryanair and the Irish government, which is facing growing political pressure not 
to sell its share.<nl/> "IAG recognizes the importance of direct air services and air route connectivity for investment 
and tourism in Ireland and intends to engage with the Irish Government in order to secure its support for the 
transaction," IAG said in a statement.<nl/> The group also stressed it intends to operate Aer Lingus as a separate 
brand, with its own management and operations.<nl/> After three failed hostile takeover bids, Ryanair holds a 29.8 
percent share of the airline, while the Irish government retained a 25.1 percent share when it privatized Aer Lingus 
in 2006.<nl/> A successful takeover would give IAG more access to take-off and landing slots at London Heathrow

Lingus has announced that it will consider a new improved takeover bid from IAG. 
The British Airways parent is now ready to pay 2.55 euros ($2.85) per share for the airline. Unlike IAG's last two 
offers, made in the last month, the Aer Lingus board did not reject the new bid immediately.<nl/> Monday's 
published offer represents a significantly higher bid than the 2.50 euros per share that airline officials circulated to 
British and Irish media over the weekend. It includes payment of an extra five-cent dividend per share.<nl/> But the 
Aer Lingus board warned that accepting the offer would be conditional on what it called "irrevocable commitments"

formed in 2009 by a merger between British Airways and Spanish carrier Iberia, and is headed by Willie Walsh, Aer 
Lingus chief executive from 2001 to 2005. It has long been considered a logical suitor for Aer Lingus following the 
failure of three hostile takeover bids by Dublin competitor Ryanair.<nl/> Ryanair also faces a regulatory order to cut 
its stake to 5 percent after its two bids left it owning 29.8 percent of the company.<nl/> Aer Lingus is most prized for

Jan 23, 2015( Branding Strategy Insider: http://www.brandingstrategyinsider.com Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> The 
temptation is to see story as a luxury item: something that brands implement to lift their margin. There's nothing 
wrong with that of course - it's powerful and it works. 
At The Blake Project[1] we don't think that story is just a top-end nice-to-have. Our view is that most brands, no 
matter where they are priced in the marketplace, need a storyline.<nl/> To understand why, first let's think about the 
alternative. Without a storyline, a product is just that. It has everything it needs (hopefully) to do what it's being 
bought for but that also means it's just another detergent, car oil, computer, whatever …That makes it highly 
vulnerable to house brands and to cheaper versions of what amounts to 'the same thing'. It also means markets get 
packed very quickly with variants of the same idea that rapidly diminish the value equation - think of Groupon and 
its 425 competitors.<nl/> This problem of course only becomes more acute as you move down the value chain - 
meaning that at the very points in the market that are most crowded and where competition is highest, the chances 
of finding differentiation are diminished, and much of the marketing amounts to little more than a rowdy discounting 
squabble based on 'unbeatable pricing'. Case in point, of course, those positioned in middle and lower markets 
should be upping their back story to compensate for this lack of differentiation.<nl/> The real power of story[2] is 
that it provides context, in two senses. First of all, it helps consumers differentiate an offering by attaching more 
than just functionality to a product. It can also help them understand why a product is priced the way it is - up or 
down. The discount airline Ryanair are masters of this. Their price is a clear call to the market - don't expect much, 
because you're not paying much. And everything they do revolves on that premise. They do have a storyline, albeit 
an unusual one, based it seems on minimalism.<nl/> Secondly, and perhaps just as importantly, a storyline gives 
the brand owner a consistent and differentiated narrative upon which to base and evolve brand marketing. Again, 
Ryanair play on this with their discussions of stand-up passengers and paying for toilets. Their whole approach to 
their business and their marketing revolves around 'how much less can we do?' Provocative it may be, but it's also 
consistent, distinctive and, in a highly effective way, it proves their price point. Even their at-times resentful 
customer service has that air of the cranky scrooge who insists on you meeting their demands on every aspect of 
your flight in order to qualify for their unreasonably low price.<nl/> Is it really that much cheaper to fly Ryanair than 
anyone else? Does it really matter? The airline brings that story to everything it does and talks about. Personally, I 
wouldn't touch them with a long pole (I fly too much not to value some level of experience), but for some people 
they are utterly irresistible.<nl/> Finally, stories introduce humanity. They make you think through and act upon a 
narrative that is fundamentally rooted in human truths. Stories generate empathy. We see ourselves in the tale. Or 
we see a side of ourselves. Or we see the 'me' that we would like to be. Without that narrative, what are brands 
Every Brand Price Point Needs A Story
going to talk about and how are you going to focus your behaviors? Exactly. Everything is going to be dominated by 
features and discounts basically. These are much more restricted lines of engagement. And without a storyline 
hook to hang them on, they're boring: witness the beauty pageant on any rush-hour ad break for evidence.<nl/> 3 
key points to think about:<nl/> Story is the new experience. Everything in marketing goes through phases. For 
some time, you couldn't move without running into experience advocates. Experience is still important, but as that 
too commoditizes, we're now seeing experiences that are informed by stories. This is no surprise really. As 
marketing becomes more social, brands will need to become even better and more sophisticated story-tellers. It's a 
pre-requisite for getting people to talk about you and think about you in positive ways.<nl/> Story helps growth. As 
companies move into new sectors and industries converge via technology, brands will need to spread their story 
consistently across diversified product lines in order to keep growing. The story will act in some ways as the 
constant point of connection for products that potentially range hugely in pricing and distribution.<nl/> Stories and 
price need to be directly aligned. Storylines themselves of course are many and varied. Some emphasize history 
and luxury. Others tie a product to a place or a hero, an idea, a challenge or an outrage. The key to success is to 
adjust the story you tell to the price you charge and vice versa. No point in telling a luxury story and charging a low 
end price. The whole thing will just look and feel out of whack. Beer brands have this down to an art - just look at 
the way lower priced drinks come with grittier and more parochial stories. Masterful.<nl/> Sponsored By: The Brand

Jan 23, 2015( evo: http://www.evo.co.uk Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> The very first issue of evo that I worked on 
was number 074 (December 2004) and in its pages was arguably one of the best photos the magazine has ever 
published: the two Zondas[1] chasing each other towards snowy peaks in bright sunshine was the stuff dreams are 
made of. The cars were amazing, but the location was equally jaw-dropping. 
So when, some 45 issues later, I found myself in Pescara needing to get back to Maranello in a Ferrari 430 
Scuderia[2], I knew which way I wanted to go…<nl/> You'll find Pescara on the east coast of Italy, about level with 
Rome, and from here you need to head inland towards Penne and then from there towards the village of Farindola 
just beyond San Quirico. After that you are looking for the SP8 -- follow the signs towards L'Aquila (where the 
earthquake happened in April 2009).<nl/> From here you will be on a rather broken and lumpy road travelling 
through dense deciduous woodland. Keep going. Eventually a succession of six hairpins will begin and then a little 
further on the trees will begin to recede and views will start to appear to your left. Eventually, just as you reach a big 
90-degree left-hand bend, the plateau will open out in front of you with the road (still not in great condition) 
stretching out in a straight line across it.<nl/> It's a vast and barren landscape, but with the mountains of the Gran 
Sasso acting like a fortress around the edge, it has a dramatic roof-of-the-world feel to it. At a T-junction you could 
go either left or right and be presented with fabulous scenery and roads, but it's to the right (still towards L'Aquila) 
where the shot with the Zondas was taken. As I found in the Ferrari, some roads near here might have barriers 
across depending on what time of year you are visiting and how much snow is left, but the descent, whichever way 
you head from here, will be one to remember.<nl/><nl/> How to get there<nl/> If you want to drive your own car out 
to Italy then be warned that it is a very long way - it's 1000 miles from Calais to Pescara alone. However, the 
advantage of doing this is that you can make a real trip of it, taking in some Alpine passes and stopping off at 
Modena along the way. There are also some excellent tunnels on the coastal motorway heading from Rimini down 
to Pescara. The dreaded Ryanair does fly directly to Pescara from Stansted five times a week, but there are 
obviously many more flight options if you decide to go to Rome and hire a car from there.<nl/> Where to stay<nl/> 
There are numerous options in either Pescara or l'Aquila, but if you want to stay closer to the roads of the Gran 
Sasso then you could try the Hotel Rigopiano. It is remote and we can't verify its four-star rating from experience, 
but it is ideally situated on the road up from Farindola. <nl/> What to watch out for<nl/> If you've got the time then 
you might like to try to retrace the old road circuit at Pescara. It was the longest ever Grand Prix circuit, with one lap 
stretching out a massive 16 miles. The last race held there was in 1961 and was won, to the great joy of the home 
crowd, by Bandini in a Ferrari. See evo 119 and the excellent book The Last Road Race by Richard Williams for 
more information.<nl/><nl/> Michelin recommends<nl/> For such a dramatic backdrop, you need an equally 
Great drives: Gran Sasso D'Italia
extreme car. The Koenigsegg Agera R[3] is one of the wildest cars you can currently buy, and would feel right at 
home on the wide-open flowing sections of the Gran Sasso d'Italia. The Agera R has a claimed top speed of 
273mph, but thanks to the latest Michelin Pilot Super Sport tyres it's also highly controllable, and should make light 
work of the beautiful landscape. <nl/> Koenigsegg worked closely with Michelin to ensure the Super Sport is 
perfectly matched to the Agera R's demanding needs. Thanks to Michelin's hugely successful motorsports 
activities, including 15 consecutive wins at the Le Mans 24 Hours, the Super Sport tyres really have benefitted a 
huge amount. Not only do they provide excellent grip and balance in dry or wet conditions, the Super Sports are 
also very durable thanks to the use of dual tyre compounds - extending the useable life of these high-performance 
tyres.<nl/> [ 1]: http://www.evo.co.uk/pagani/zonda [ 2]:            http://www.evo.co.uk/ferrari/f430/9874/ferrari-430-

Jan 19, 2015( IPKat Weblog: http://ipkitten.blogspot.com Delivered by Newstex)  Here, courtesy of our gallant and 
ever-dependable Katfriend Alberto Bellan,[1] is the 29th consecutive "Never Too Late" post, in which the contents of 
last week's substantive Katposts are carefully summarised so that our readers who were too busy or absent last 
week can skim through them and see which ones they missed. Click the title and you can read it in full. Anyway, 
here they are: * A film about Martin Luther King without King's actual words: is it really a copyright problem?
[2] Selma is a film about Martin Luther King that does not feature any actual extracts from his historic speeches. Is 
that copyright's fault, wonders Eleonora? * Copyright judgments in 2015: what's in the pipeline from the CJEU (and 
will we be able to understand them?)[3]2015 will be another busy copyright year for the Court of Justice of the 
European Union, and this post by Tom lists all the decisions we are waiting for, and why. * Big, green and 
understated: the new Modern Law of Patents[4]Jeremy presents the third edition of The Modern Law of Patents, 
which Katfriends Ashley Roughton, Phillip Johnson, and Trevor Cook have manufactured with love and just 
published with LexisNexis. * China's IP journey: from 'bad guys' to 'good guys' to patent superpower[5]Suleman 
takes a look at the development of the Chinese patent system and how China has made the transition from being a 
'pirate' nation to a 'protector' of patent rights, acquiring a functional modern patent system in three decades. What 
can we learn any lessons from China's story? * BREAKING NEWS: someone wants to register 'Je suis Charlie' as a 
trade mark[6] and it is not Charlie Hebdo, explains Eleonora. * Lions, unicorns and the prospect of a 
licence[7]Prospective licensees of the UK IPO logo are required to complete and submit a form and comply with 
some conditions of use provided by the UK Trade Mark Act. The regime entails some interesting peculiarities 
though, explains Jeremy. * An Enterprising Victory, with Arnold J in the driving seat[8]To what extent can context 
change the likelihood of confusion? Does a survey ever help? How do you consider the position where a proportion 
of the customer base comes from overseas? These questions, among other things, find a response in High Court 
for England and Wales, Chancery Division's ruling of Mr Justice Arnold in Enterprise Holdings Inc v Europcar Group 
UK and Another [2015] EWHC 17 (Ch), which Katfriend Aaron Wood[9] (Swindell ...arson Ltd) kindly reports. * 
Copyright in Spain: a month without Google News[10]Spanish IP enthusiast Mmchel Olmedo Cuevas[11] explains 
how humanity has fared in Spain, a month after the withdrawal there of the Google News service. * BREAKING: 
CJEU says that owner of an online database not protected by copyright or sui generis right may restrict its use by 
contract[12]The CJEU has just issued its 46-paragraph decision[13] in Case C-30/14 Ryanair, a reference for a 
preliminary ruling from The Netherlands seeking clarification as regards the Database Directive[14]. As Eleonora 
explains, the CJEU considered whether it is ok to contractually limit the use of online databases which are not 
protected on the basis of the Directive. * Can Unified Patent Court and national laws of infringement diverge? An 
Never too late: if you missed the IPKat last week ...
IPKat dialogue[15]As he explained in an earlier post [here[16]], Darren is truly convinced that the UPC Agreement 
[17]will lead UPC Members to conform their national law of patent infringement to that specified in the UPCA 
(Articles 25 to 30). But not all think alike, as this Kat dialogue between Darren and Donal Kelly[18], senior associate 
at FR Kelly, well-illustrates. * Monaco "devoid of distinctive character", rules EU court[19]The General Court 
delivered its judgement in Case T-197/13[20] Monaco v OHIM. The result must have disappointed the brand-
sensitive denizens of the Principality [whose devotion to the exclusive use of the Monaco-based geographical 
location "Monte Carlo" has been ridiculed in this weblog here[21] and here[22]], observes Jeremy. * Major Italian 
newspaper infringes artists' copyright on account that it would have taken too long to clear the rights[23]As 
Eleonora reports, the Italian most important newspaper Corriere della Sera released a collection of cartoons by 
professional and amateur artists to raise funds in favour of Charlie Hebdo. In the name of freedom of press, the 
Corriere also introduced into the Italian system a brand-new Exception For-Charity, which applies whenever one 
promises to destine revenues of the infringement to a good cause and is in a hurry to ride on the crest of a recent 
tragedy. * GoPro and the Apple patent: buy on the rumour, sell on the fact?[24]As a general rule, the granting of a 
one-off patent is usually not a market-moving event. But companies like Apple are an exception, as last week's 
grant of a patent in the digital camera system area made shares in GoPro slipped more than 13%. It is often said on 
Wall Street that 'one buys on the rumour and sells on the fact', but the sale of the GoPro shares was as much about 
rumour and speculation as fact, observes Neil. * Biotech patent case law: why is it different, idiosyncratic and 
always changing?[25]This is the third post in series of six on biotech inventions [the earlier posts can be found 
here[26] and here[27]] kindly provided by Suleman. Among other things, this piece provide a thoughtful in-sight view 
over biotech-inventions' subject matter and criteria that lead those inventions to meet the inventive step 
requirement. * JE SUIS CHARLIE: Alicante acts on speculative trade mark applications[28]The Office for 
Harmonisation in the Internal Market issued a recent statement saying that whoever tries to apply for a 'Je suis 
Charlie' trade mark [on which see earlier Katposts here [29]and here[30]; Class 46 here [31]and the MARQUES 
LinkedIn Discussion Group here[32]] might experience some problems. You'd better not mess with the Alicante 
guys, bro. ****************************** PREVIOUSLY, ON NEVER TOO LATE Never too late 28[33] [week ending

 Case C‑30/14[1], Ryanair Ltd v PR Aviation BV is a real quickie. The request for a preliminary ruling from the Court 
of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) was only made a year ago, on 17 January 2014, -- and, spared the 
excitement of Advocate General Bot's Opinion, we already have the CJEU's response. 
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GVg_ZLwRLjY/VLfVO3WfejI/AAAAAAAA3Bc/W7yIGBKOJG4/s1600/ryan.jpgThe 
facts 
are straightforward. PR ran a website on which consumers could search through the flight data of low-cost air 
companies, compare prices and, on payment of commission, book a flight. It took the data it needed, in order to 
satisfy consumers' requests, from a dataset linked to the Ryanair website which was also accessible to consumers. 
So far as Ryanair was concerned, anyone accessing its own website had to accept its general terms and conditions 
by ticking a box to that effect. These contained the following clauses: '2. Exclusive distribution. This website and the 
Ryanair call centre are the exclusive distributors of Ryanair services. Ryanair.com is the only website authorised to 
sell Ryanair flights. Ryanair does not authorise other websites to sell its flights, whether on their own or as part of a 
package. …
3. Permitted use. You are not permitted to use this website other than for the following, private, non-commercial 
purposes: (i) viewing this website; (ii) making bookings; (iii) reviewing/changing bookings; (iv) checking 
arrival/departure information; (v) performing online check-in; (vi) transferring to other websites through links 
provided on this website; and (vii) making use of other facilities that may be provided on the website. The use of 
automated systems or software to extract data from this website or            www.bookryanair.com[2] for commercial 
purposes, ('screen scraping') is prohibited unless the third party has directly concluded a written licence agreement 
with Ryanair in which permits it access to Ryanair's price, flight and timetable information for the sole purpose of 
price comparison.' Relying on Directive 96/9 (the Database Directive[3]) and the local Dutch database and copyright 
statutes, Ryanair claimed that PR had infringed its rights relating to its data set and that it had acted contrary to the 
terms and condition of use of its website which the latter had accepted; Ryanair asked for an injunction and 
damages. 
The Rechtbank Utrecht dismissed Ryanair's claim in so far as it was based on an infringement of Directive 96/9 and 
the local Database Law, but allowed it under the copyright law. PR appealed and Ryanair cross-appealed to the 
Gerechtshof te Amsterdam, which both set aside the judgment of the Rechtbank Utrecht and dismissed Ryanair's 
cross appeal. Ryanair then appealed to the Hoge Raad, which decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the 
following question to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling: 'Does the operation of [Directive 96/9] also extend to online 
Ryanair scrapes home in database dust-up
databases which are not protected by copyright on the basis of Chapter II of [that directive], and also not by a sui 
generis right on the basis of Chapter III, in the sense that the freedom to use such databases through the (whether 
or not analogous) application of Article[s] 6(1) and 8 in conjunction with Article 15 [of Directive 96/9], may not be 
limited contractually?'This morning the CJEU ruled as follows: Directive 96/9 ... must be interpreted as meaning that 
it is not applicable to a database which is not protected either by copyright or by the sui generis right under that 
directive, so that Articles 6(1), 8 and 15 of that directive do not preclude the author of such a database from laying 
down contractual limitations on its use by third parties, without prejudice to the applicable national law.Does this 
ruling make sense? It does seem strange that the owner of a non-original database which has no copyright 
protection has a greater degree of contractual freedom than the owner of a database that enjoys protection under 
the Directive. However, one might say that the limitations on the rights of the owner of a protected database are a 
quid pro quo for its being protected in the first place -- not that this would be a logical justification for the outcome.
There's a thoughtful note by fellow blogger Eleonora on the IPKat weblog here[4], which has already attracted some 
comments.

LdVdLDhCouY/VLd97F6437I/AAAAAAAAGJE/jVVklrbv5P0/s1600/CJEU-logo.jpgAs Tom explained[1] a few days 
ago, 2015 will be a busy copyright year at everybody's favourite court, ie the Court of Justice of the European Union 
(CJEU), with both a number of cases awaiting decision and new ones likely to be referred by national courts.
 Well, today's the day of the first copyright judgment of the year. The CJEU has just issued its 46-paragraph 
decision[2] in Case C-30/14 Ryanair, a reference for a preliminary ruling from The Netherlands seeking clarification 
as regards the ever-sexy Database Directive[3] [Directive 96/9]. There are two peculiarities of this reference worth 
highlighting, one shocking and the other, well, not-so-shocking. Starting with the latter, this is yet another case that 
the CJEU decided without the need for the Opinion of an Advocate General (AG) first [on the seemingly fading role 
of AGs in the EU copyright landscape see http://ipkitten.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/luxembourg-we-have-problem-
where-have.htmlhere]. As regards the shocking feature of this reference, this is that this time the CJEU had to 
answer just one (1!) question, ie: Does the operation of the [Database Directive] also extend to online databases 
which are not protected by copyright on the basis of Chapter II of the Directive, and also not by a sui generis right 
on the basis of Chapter III, in the sense that the freedom to use such databases through the (whether or not 
analogous) application of Articles 6(1) and 8 in conjunction with Article 15 [of the Database Directive], may not be 
limited contractually? Incidentally Merpel notes that neither the lack of an AG Opinion nor the fact that the CJEU 
only had to address one question prevented the Court from taking almost one year to deliver its ruling. But what 
was 
this 
case 
all 
about?

xXGG3USf0oA/VLeGN5rlFSI/AAAAAAAAGJU/kD9Lhexh7eM/s1600/ryanair-Low-Fare-Airlines-006.jpg Background 
Dutch company PR Aviation operates a website[4] that allows [or rather: allowed?] customers in The Netherlands to 
compare the prices of low-cost airlines - including Ryanair - and, upon payment of a commission, book a flight. The 
problem is that the Terms of Use[5] of the Ryanair website provide that this "is the only website authorised to sell 
Ryanair flights, whether on their own or as part of a package. Price comparison websites may apply to enter into a 
written Licence Agreement with Ryanair, which permits such websites to access Ryanair's price, flight and timetable 
information for the sole purpose of price comparison." It is not hard to imagine that Ryanair was not happy with the 
PR Aviation website, and indeed brought proceedings in The Netherlands for infringement of both Ryanair's 
contractual terms and rights - whether copyright or sui generis right - in its public database.In 2010 the Local Court, 
Utrecht, partly dismissed Ryanair's claims, notably those relating to the Database Directive and its Dutch 
BREAKING: CJEU says that owner of an online database not protected by copyright or sui generis right may 
restrict its use by contract
transposition. In 2012 Court of Appeal, Amsterdam, completely ruled against Ryanair, holding that PR Aviation's 
conduct was a legitimate use of the Ryanair website. Ryanair appealed the decision before the Netherlands 
Supreme Court, which decided to stay the proceedings and refer the question mentioned above to the CJEU. What 
the CJEU held The CJEU ruled that the Database Directive only applies to databases protected by copyright or the 
sui generis right [it is left to the referring court to determine whether this is actually the case of Ryanair], and that the 
holder of a publicly accessible database is free to determine by contract and in compliance with the applicable 
national law the conditions of use of its database.The same would not be true for a database protected by copyright 
or the sui generis right, because of a number of provisions, ie Articles 6(1), 8 and 15, in the Database Directive that 
- at certain conditions - prohibit contractual limitations in the use of a database.In particular the CJEU held that: "it is 
clear from the purpose and structure of Directive 96/9 that Articles 6(1), 8 and 15 thereof, which establish 
mandatory rights for lawful users of databases, are not applicable to a database which is not protected either by 
copyright or by the sui generis right under that directive, so that it does not prevent the adoption of contractual 
clauses concerning the conditions of use of such a database." [para 39]            http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-y-
8EQGpGozE/VLeN0VGazEI/AAAAAAAAGJk/nkgJnMX8x1A/s1600/IMG_2014.PNG So? This ruling does not look 
particularly shocking from a legal standpoint, yet it may have significant implications for the business model of those 
websites that, not only offer users the possibility to compare the prices of relevant goods or services, but also allow 
them to purchase such goods and services directly, without the need of going to the website of the actual provider 
of goods and services. But why could one possibly want to prevent customers from purchasing goods and services 
via third-party-operated websites? One reason may be to ensure the consistent quality of the services and goods 
provided, including with regard to post-sale assistance. For instance, in the string of recent cases against 
screenscraper websites, Ryanair has claimed[6] that many of these third-party sites cause problems for Ryanair 
customers, as they fail to pass on vital information on issues such as flight changes, web check-in, and special 
needs assistance and contact details. Another, possibly more mundane, reason may have something to do with the 
revenues generated by the ads displayed on the actual provider's website, Ryanair itself probably being an 
example.On a final note, it is perhaps worth observing how we are used to live in a world in which most people 
would be thrilled to be able to claim copyright or, at least, sui generis protection over their databases. Yet the 
decision in Ryanair shows that in some instances it is not that bad that this may not be the case, as at least one 
remains 
free 
to 
tailor 
the 
relevant 
contractual 
terms 
as 
they 
please.

Cyprus Airways to be liquidated, Aegean , Blue Air fill the gap

 Cyprus Airways, the troubled state-owned airline of the small EU country, has announced plans to apply for 
voluntary liquidation as other airlines reportedly rushed to fill the vacuum left in the Mediterranean Island.
 On January 9, the European Commission ordered Cyprus Airways to pay back over €65 million in illegal state aid, 
triggering its immediate grounding and ending 68 years of operations.
 Rival companies Aegean Airlines and Blue Air announced substantial expansion in operations to and from the 
island on January 13.
 Aegean Airlines is reportedly looking to almost triple its operation on Cyprus - from 500,000 passengers annually to 
1.5 million - adding 13 destinations to its flight plan and increasing the number of planes stationed on the island 
from one to four. Aegean also announced new destinations for Cyprus, including Heathrow.
 Meanwhile, Romanian low cost carrier Blue Air also announced an expansion to its operations. The company will 
set up an operations centre in Cyprus on January 19, flying to Athens seven times a week and three times a week 
to Thessaloniki.
 Meanwhile, the board of directors of Cyprus Airways said it has decided to initiate the procedure for voluntary 
liquidation and to that effect all necessary measures will be taken.
 On January 12, dismissed Cyprus Airways staff reportedly scuffled with police during protests against the closure 
of the national carrier. Around 300 staff demonstrated outside the Cyprus Finance Ministry in Nicosia to voice their 
disagreement with the government over the closure of the airline.
 Passengers with Cyprus Airways tickets up to and including February 9 will have their alternative travel funded by 
the Cypriot government, Cyprus Airways said. According to local media, the Cypriot state recently acquired the 
Cyprus Airways brand, which will be used to launch a successor of the same name. Previously Aegean Airlines 
and Ryanair had emerged as potential bidders for the hapless carrier.

 Shares of American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL[1]) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV[2]) declined 4.69% and 1.32% 
respectively on Jan 12, following the disclosure of their individual traffic data for Dec 2014.
 
 On comparison, the numbers revealed by American Airlines were more disappointing. Revenue passenger miles 
(RPMs) came in at 18.1 billion for the month, down 0.4% year over year. Weakness in traffic in the Latin American 
and Atlantic divisions hurt results. Capacity increased 3.7% to 22.5 billion. Load factor (% of seats filled) came in at 
80.4%, down 3.4% from the year-ago figure.
 
 The carrier projects consolidated passenger revenue per available seat mile or PRASM (a measure of unit 
revenue) for the final quarter of 2014 to be approximately flat to down 2%. The weak forecast coupled with the 
below par traffic numbers for December clearly failed to please investors. For 2014, RPMs improved 1.1% to 217.9 
billion. Load factor for the year declined 0.9% from 2013 to 82%.
 
 Shares of Southwest Airlines too fell albeit marginally after the company declared that its PRASM for December 
declined in the range of 4% to 5% on a year-over-year basis. The metric is however estimated to increase in the 
range of 1% to 2% in the final quarter of 2014.
 
 Load factor for the month of December declined 10 basis points to 82.7%. RPMs came in at 9.2 billion, up 2.8% 
year over year. Capacity of this low-cost carrier also increased 2.9% to 11.2 billion.

Ryanair 's planning in-flight entertainment and Wi-Fi…possibly for free
Ryanair's planning in-flight entertainment and Wi-Fi…possibly for free

 Ryanair[1] has announced that it plans to trial in-flight entertainment and Wi-Fi on some of its flights this year, 
reports Reuters.[2]
 The announcement is the latest in a series of moves to make the airline more appealing to business travelers. Last 
year, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary pledged to cease 'unnecessarily pissing people off.[3]'
 The airline became notorious for finding ways to levy extra charges on customers, so much so that O'Leary once 
joked about making passengers pay to use the onboard lavatories.
 Since last year's change in strategy, Ryanair has cut penalty charges, redesigned its famously frustrating website, 
invested heavily in marketing and introduced business class.
 Ryanair's Chief Technology Officer, John Hurley, said today that the airline may introduce inflight entertainment 
and Wi-Fi for free, subsidised by ads for companies in the destination city.
 Hurley indicated that Wi-Fi will be trialled later this year on routes favoured by business travelers. Pricing hasn't 
been decided yet but while light usage for tasks like email may be free, heavier usage will likely be charged.

 2015 will be another busy copyright year for the CJEU, starting with Case C-30/14[1] Ryanair (copyright/database 
rights) this Thursday [watch this space], followed a week later on 22 January by C-419/13[2] Art Allposters 
(exhaustion of rights) [on which see here[3], here[4] and here[5]] and C-441/13[6] Hejduk (online jurisdictional 
issues) [see            http://ipkitten.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/breaking-ag-cruz-cruz-villalon-suggests.htmlhere]. Later 
this year, we expect to see rulings in C-279/13[7] C More Entertainment (hyperlinks) [see            
http://the1709blog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/c-more-does-anyone-know-more.htmlhere] and 3 cases on the scope of 
the private copying exception: C-463/12[8] Copydan [here[9]], C-572/13[10] Hewlett-Packard [here[11]] and C-
470/14[12] Egeda [here[13]]. With this in mind, and as we enter a new year (and reluctantly emerge from the cranial 
fuzziness induced by the festive period), this Kat thought that now would be a timely opportunity to recap on the 
relevance of CJEU judgments and share some thoughts on the challenges (and frustrations) encountered in 
practice when seeking to interpret and advise on these rulings. 
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PGQDpokuEyI/VLAEzU-
37aI/AAAAAAAABEE/LyKs3VauKyw/s1600/Cranial%2Bfuzziness2.jpg
 Preliminary rulings from the CJEU: what are they again? National courts from any EU Member State can seek 
guidance from the CJEU on the correct interpretation of European law to enable it to properly apply that law to the 
facts of the case before it [i.e. The CJEU is not supposed to does not apply the law to the facts of the referred case, 
which is an exercise reserved for the referring court.] In the copyright context, references are usually in relation to 
the Information Society Directive (2001/29/EC[14]), which sets out, amongst other things, the scope of the exclusive 
rights and exceptions to those rights. In interpreting a European directive, the CJEU must consider its wording, the 
context in which it occurs and its underlying objectives. The CJEU must also interpret the directive in a manner 
consistent with international law, particularly where its provisions are intended to give specific effect to an 
international agreement (e.g. the WIPO Copyright Treaty, TRIPS). What impact does a CJEU ruling have on EU 
Member States? 
 The CJEU's rulings are very important with potentially wide-reaching ramifications across the EU. This is because 
the CJEU's rulings establish how a European directive is to be interpreted. EU national courts must, in turn, seek to 
interpret their national law so far as is possible in conformity with, and to achieve the result intended by, that 
directive (known as the 'Marleasing principle'). CJEU rulings are binding on the referring court and other Member 
Copyright judgments in 2015: what's in the pipeline from the CJEU (and will we be able to understand them?)
State courts. The operative part of the ruling is found at the end, where the CJEU provides its 'answers' to the 
referred questions. The 'answers' [often phrased in a less-than-clear manner] are to be interpreted by national 
courts in light of the CJEU's underlying reasoning that is found in the preceding paragraphs. However, in practice, 
the level of detail about the CJEU's underlying reasoning can be lacking, which can lead to difficulties when 
advising on the ruling's implications (as to which see further below). [This Kat's personal view is that the absence of 
detailed reasoning may be a by-product of the unanimous nature of a CJEU's ruling which must endorsed by all 
judges convened to hear the case (there is no provision for a dissenting judgment). It is feasible that any 
contentious paragraphs (i.e. the underlying reasoning) are vulnerable to being removed unless all the convened 
judges can be brought on-board. If this is a correct assumption, one can imagine the behind-the-scenes challenges 
in getting three judges (let alone thirteen judges in a Grand Chamber case) to agree on the underlying reasoning.] 
Can CJEU rulings be appealed? 
 CJEU rulings are final - although a ruling can be disturbed by a subsequent judgment of the CJEU. [This Kat 
wonders however whether there have been any cases where CJEU rulings raise substantive human rights issues 
and how this might relate (if at all) to the appeal process to the European Court of Human Rights. Do readers have 
any thoughts on this?] What role does the Advocate-General play?
 An Advocate-General is usually assigned to each reference and his/her role is to assist the CJEU by providing an 
impartial and independent legal opinion on the referred case. Roughly speaking, the CJEU tends to follow the 
Opinion in around 80% of cases. However, crucially, the Opinion is not binding on the CJEU or the national courts, 
unless the CJEU's ruling expressly adopts particular paragraphs of the Opinion. How does the preliminary 
reference procedure work? 
 In brief: The national court refers questions to the CJEU - either at its own initiative or at the parties' request - via 
an 'Order for Reference' which is accompanied by the court's summary of the relevant factual background, the 
relevant points of law, and the questions put to the CJEU.The parties to the proceedings, any Member State, and 
the EU Commission can file written submissions [known as 'written observations'] to the CJEU within a set time 
period (usually around 2 months from the date of the Order for Reference). Written observations are filed 
simultaneously and there is usually no opportunity to provide any written evidence in reply. [So you have to set out 
your case, predict what opposing arguments might be raised, and counter these where possible in your written 
observations.]An oral hearing may be convened at the parties' request where the CJEU considers it is necessary 
for further submissions. Parties are usually only given 20 minutes to make oral submissions, and the CJEU may 
direct that submissions are focused on specific points [i.e. the written observations are really the only opportunity 
you have to set out your substantive case]. The hearing is heard in public [if you fancy a trip to Luxembourg], but it 
is not possible to obtain a transcript of the hearing (as far as this Kat is aware).The Advocate-General may provide 
an Opinion (although an Opinion is not always requested).The CJEU hands down its ruling [roughly speaking, 
between 18-24 months after the Order for Reference, and usually around 3-4 months after the Opinion if there is 
one]Parties tear their hair out trying to understand what on earth the CJEU meant.

x_xpGC4BkpI/VLADGIn7cxI/AAAAAAAABD4/8XEf3amlzOY/s1600/Confused%2Bcat.jpg What are the challenges 
in interpreting CJEU rulings? This Kat's personal experience is that interpreting CJEU rulings can be a frustrating, 
costly, and challenging exercise where, for instance, the ruling raises more questions than answers. One example 
of this is the recent Svensson ruling on hyperlinks, where there remains uncertainty as to its application in the 
context of infringing content [see            http://ipkitten.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/post-svensson-stress-disorder-1-
does-it.htmlhere] 
and 
what 
constitutes 
a 
"freely 
available" 
work 
[see 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
http://ipkitten.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/post-svensson-stress-disorder-2-what.htmlhere]. A further issue is when the 
CJEU [unilaterally] decides to 'paraphrase' the questions carefully formulated by the referring court and delivers its 
'answer' on the basis of its own re-formulated question. This can lead to substantive argument between the parties 
on what the CJEU meant, and how its ruling should be applied to the facts of a case. This issue is compounded 
where the ruling also lacks sufficient underlying reasoning, leaving the national courts trying to make reasoned 
assumptions on what the CJEU intended. One example of this was in SAS Institute where during the hearing the 
Court of Appeal[15] commented how it had to indulge in 'an exercise in Kremlinology[16]' to try and infer what the 
CJEU intended in its third ruling in the absence of sufficient underlying reasoning. What improvements could be 
made to the preliminary reference procedure? 
Copyright judgments in 2015: what's in the pipeline from the CJEU (and will we be able to understand them?)
 A particular bugbear for this (primarily English-speaking) Kat is when Opinions of the Advocate-General are 
translated into the vast majority of EU languages except for English (as was the case in Art Allposters, Hejduk, 
Ulmer, and Copydan). Even where the Advocate-General's Opinion is not ultimately followed by the CJEU, 
generally speaking, the Opinion usually provides a greater degree of analysis and detail than the CJEU's ruling 
(including the arguments submitted by the parties and often the factual background underlying the reference). It can 
therefore provide a helpful insight into the underlying factual background which is relevant to anyone needing to 
understand how a CJEU ruling might be applied in different circumstances. As helpful as Google Translate may be, 
it is sub-optimal (to say the least) to have to try and advise on an Opinion that is not written in your native language. 
Another observation is the extent to which Member States generally engage in the preliminary reference process by 
filing written observations, which are taken into account by the CJEU when making its ruling. If we pick out this 
Kat's 
11 
major 
CJEU 
cases 
from 
the 
last 
year 
(Svensson, PRCA, UPC 
Telekabel, Deckmyn, ACI 
Adam, Ulmer, Nintendo, Blomqvist, OSA, HI Hotel, BestWater), the Member States collectively filed 31 written 
observations with the following breakdown: Italy, Poland: 5UK: 4Austria, Germany: 3France, Netherlands: 
2Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Lithuania, Spain: 1 (The European Commission diligently 
filed written observations in every case.) In light of the significance of CJEU rulings across all Member States, 
should more Member State governments be engaging with the process? And if so, is the current framework 
adequate to encourage participation (in particular, the tight timeframes for interested parties to feed back to their 
national governments the issues raised by the referred case)? In addition, should written observations be made 
publically available so we can understand what position has been adopted by each Member State? What do 
readers think?

 One stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY[1]). This is 
because this security in the Transportation-Airline space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity, and is in 
great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective.
 
 This is important because, often times, a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry, as there can be broad trends 
taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board. This is arguably taking place in the 
Transportation-Airline space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 6 out of more than 250 industries, 
suggesting it is well-positioned from this perspective, especially when compared to other segments out there.
 
 Meanwhile, Ryanair Holdings is actually looking pretty good on its own too. The firm has seen solid earnings 
estimate revision activity over the past month, suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm's 
prospects in both the short and long term.
 
 In fact, over the past month, current quarter estimates have narrowed from a loss of 18 cents per share to a loss of 
6 cents per share, while current year estimates have risen from $3.54 per share to $3.58 per share. This has helped 
RYAAY to earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), further underscoring the company's solid position.
 
 So, if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry, consider Ryanair Holdings. Not only is its industry 
currently in the top third, but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late, suggesting it could be a very interesting 
choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment.

United Continental Hits 52-Week High on Expansion Plans - Analyst Blog

Jan 02, 2015 (Zacks Investment Research:http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 Shares of United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL[1]) hit a new 52-week high of $67.77 on Dec 31, 2014. However, 
the company ended the day's trading a trifle lower at $66.89, reflecting a solid 77% return over the past 12 months.
 
 Moreover, so far this year, the stock has moved up around 77%, driven by robust financial numbers. United 
Continental has delivered positive earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 6.4%, 
including a positive surprise of 1.9% in the third quarter of 2014.
 
 Growth Drivers
 
 Shares have been on an upswing ever since United Continental announced its plans to initiate non-stop flights 
between Chicago and Rome starting summer 2015. The carrier thus continues to expand its Trans Atlantic and 
Pacific routes by initiating new flights in the regions, to capitalize on the growing travel demand in the European 
sub-continent. 
 
 In addition, United Continental plans to boost its summer 2015 itinerary with flights between Washington Dulles 
and Paris and between New York and Venice. It has initiated flights between San Francisco and Tokyo's Haneda 
Airport. It has also connected Los Angeles and Melbourne with non-stop six daily flights per week, starting Oct 
2014.
 
 Also, United Continental is well poised to gain from the decline in crude oil prices as oil costs account for nearly 
30% of its operating expenditure. Moreover, replacing older planes in its fleet with new fuel-efficient ones will likely 
boost operating margin for the company.
 Robust Third-Quarter Earnings
 
 On Oct 23, 2014, United Continental posted its third-quarter 2014 numbers. Adjusted earnings of $2.75 per share 
were ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.70. The results improved substantially from earnings of $2.37 
per share in the comparable prior-year period.

 Estimate Revisions Reflect Strength
 
 Despite the strong price appreciation, the stock has room for plenty of upside, given the positive estimate revisions 
witnessed over the past 30 days. In the last 30 days, for 2014, the company has witnessed five upward revisions 
with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings moving up from $4.97 to $5.06. The Zacks Consensus Estimate 
for fourth-quarter 2014 is pegged at $1.18, representing robust year-over-year growth of 50.80%.
 
 Other Stocks to Consider
 
 United Continental currently holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Apart from United Continental, investors 
interested in the airline sector may also consider stocks like Southwest Airlines (LUV[2]), Delta Air Lines (DAL[3]) 
and Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY[4]). All the three stocks sport the same Zacks Rank as United Continental.

 Transportation in Slovakia was affected by several trends during 2013. Air continued to decline in 2013 in terms of 
the number of passengers and revenues. Passengers flow decreased due to decline in amount of passengers 
carried by low cost carriers. This was thanks to strong competition from smaller airports in Hungary, the Czech 
Republic and Poland, which are located within driving distance from the Slovak borders. Another important factor is 
the lower attractiveness of Slovak destinations for...
The overall performance of the transportation category remains strongly influenced by air transportation, thus the 
12% value decline in air transportation in 2012 strongly contributed to the 3% decline in transportation as a whole. 
The dominant (58%) value share of other transportation, however, meant that the overall decline of transportation 
was not stronger. It is nevertheless argued that the poor transportation infrastructure in Slovakia, especially the 
quality of roads and the slow upgrade of the railways, is providing a barrier to the wider development and further 
growth of tourism in the country. For example, due to the long journey time, many visitors are not inclined to visit 
areas of natural beauty in northern Slovakia. Although a motorway is being built to connect Bratislava and Košice, 
whilst also travelling through several major tourism destinations, the project is facing major delays in the 
mountainous areas and it has been suggested that the motorway will not be finished before 2021. Likewise, over a 
period of 10 years, only one quarter of the renovation work of the major railway between Bratislava and Košice has 
been completed.
Ryanair Holdings Plc led air transportation in 2012, posting a 44% retail value share (with sales of €55 million). 
Ryanair operated 56 flights each week from Bratislava Airport, making it a dominant operator in terms of regular 
flights. Ryanair is slowly reducing its presence in Slovakia, but towards the end of the review period its share 
remained relatively stable. Although it has announced plans for the expansion of its services, this is dependent on 
the commercial conditions of Bratislava Airport.
The effects of the economic downturn are expected to ease during the forecast period, during which time the 
transportation category is set to return to positive growth. The category will benefit from consumers' growing 
willingness to spend more on their holidays; total air passenger numbers are expected to rise at a CAGR of 1%.

 United Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL[1]), and online travel 
company Orbitz (OWW[2]) have filed a lawsuit against Aktarer Zaman, the 22-year old founder of the travel site, 
Skiplagged.com.
 The site helps travelers to find cheap flights by utilizing the "hidden city" ticketing strategy. United and Orbitz have 
claimed $75,000 as lost revenues from Zaman. The companies believe that Zaman's site, which searches for 
routes prohibited by carriers, has hurt their business by creating unfair competition. United Airlines has also stated 
that the utilization of the strategy poses security threats and is unjust as far as high-paying passengers are 
concerned.
 Using the strategy, passengers can get off a plane at their desired destination during a layover at that place, and 
thus avoid the remaining portion of the otherwise longer flight. Fliers, with the help of Zaman's site, can save money 
by purchasing tickets for longer flights with layovers that are often cheaper compared to direct flights of shorter 
distance.
 For example, if a traveler wants to fly to Chicago from New York, he would save money by availing a New York-Los 
Angeles flight with a layover in Chicago. He would thus get off at Chicago and skip the last leg of the trip.
 However, passengers can benefit from the system only if they are traveling without checked bags as checked 
luggage for flights with layovers are handed over only at the final destination. Moreover, the system is only 
applicable for one-way tickets. This is because in the event of passengers failing to show up for one leg of a flight, 
airlines companies cancel the return leg.
 Zaman intends to fight the case and is raising funds for the purpose. He states that the website is by no means 
illegal and he has derived no profit from the site. According to the Bangladesh-born entrepreneur, he has only 
exposed an inefficiency in airline prices that has been in existence for long. We expect investors to keep a close 
watch on the fate of Zaman's site in the coming days.

 United Continental currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Apart from United Continental, investors

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY[1]) is the king of low cost airlines in Europe. These are the best of times for airlines as 
fuel costs plummet. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to grow earnings by the double digits in both 
fiscal 2015 and 2016.
 Ryanair is a low cost airlines that operates 1,600 daily flights from 72 bases. It connects 189 destinations in 30 
countries using a fleet of over 300 Boeing 737-800 aircraft. 
Expansion is continuing at a quick pace. In September 2014, it announced that it had ordered another 280 Boeing 
737 aircraft and has the option of another 100 more at a list price of $22 billion, basically doubling its fleet. It sees 
traffic growing from 90 million to 150 million passengers in 2024.
On Dec 23, Ryanair launched a new United States specific web site in order to make it easier for American 
travelers to book European travel directly. The fares are in US dollars.
Ryanair has long been known for its cost-cutting ways. Several years ago, there was talk of the airline trying to fly 
with standing passengers as a way to cram even more passengers onto each flight to maximize profits.
However, the airline has softened its nickel-and-dime stance in 2014 and has seen an increase in traffic as a result. 
It loosened cabin bag restrictions and relaxed booking requirements, which previously were some of the tightest in 
the airline industry. This has lessened many of the prior grievances against the airlines that it was too rigid.
Full Year Guidance Raised
On Dec 4, Ryanair announced that is November traffic rose 22% to 6.35 million passengers. Its November load 
factor also rose by 7 percentage points to 88% from 81% a year ago despite increasing seat capacity by 13% and 
opening up a bunch of new city pair routes expected to appeal to business traffic.
Bull of the Day: Ryanair (RYAAY) - Bull of the Day
It had opened up those new city pairs in highly competitive routes against more established business airlines so it 
expected lower load factors. Instead, the load factors were over 80% in each of those routes, with a load factor of 
90% on the Lisbon to London flights. 
With the better-than-expected results of November, it raised its full year traffic guidance to 90 million from 89 million 
passengers.
It also raised its full year profit after-tax forecast to a range of $810 million to $830 million from its previous guidance 
of $750 million to $770 million.
Ryanair cautioned, however, that it had no visibility on the crucial fourth quarter, which runs from January until 
March.
Analysts Raising Full Year Estimates
The analysts are just as bullish as Ryanair about the future. 1 estimate has even been revised higher for both fiscal 
2015 and fiscal 2016 in just the last week.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2015 has jumped to $3.61 from $3.32 in the last 90 days. That is earnings 
growth of 43% over fiscal 2014. 
It's more of the same for fiscal 2016 as the Zacks Consensus Estimate has risen to $4.15 from $3.64 in the last 3 
months. That is further earnings growth of 15%.
Shares At New All Time Highs
Shares spiked to new record highs after the company raised full year guidance and fuel prices continued to fall as 
crude sold off. 
While shares are no longer cheap, they're not outrageously priced for the earnings growth either. Ryanair has a 
forward P/E of 18.9, which is just above the average of the SP 500 at 18x. 
For investors looking for a way to play the European, and global, economic recovery, over the next 10 years, 
Ryanair is a stock they should keep on their short lists.

 During 2013, the interest of Polish people in travelling abroad increased. This was due to greater economic stability 
in Poland, which has had a positive effect in terms of increasing spending on travel and tourism. The preferences of 
many Poles, however, are clearly changing, which has manifested itself in the search for new destinations and at 
the same time in shorter holidays. Many Poles now go on holiday for shorter periods of time more often during the 
year.
Poland, which organised the European Football Championship (EURO 2012) jointly with Ukraine, experienced great 
development in 2012 as a result. The major public investments were concentrated on road networks, sports 
stadiums and airports in the four cities which were hosting the football matches: Warsaw, Poznan, Gdansk and 
Wroclaw. The scale of investment significantly improved road networks and airport infrastructure in the regions 
hosting the football matches. However, the biggest success was seen in its good organisation and a satisfied group 
of fans. This is undoubtedly great promotional tool that should attract an increasing number of tourists over the 
forecast period as Poland becomes more widely seen as a great travel destination country.
During the review period an increasing number of people coming from wealthier Western European countries such 
as Germany and Great Britain visited Poland for medical treatments. High quality of services, professional 
employees and competitive prices make Poland an attractive destination country for medical purposes. Promising 
prospects of medical tourism in Poland were seen also by the government, which introduced a promotion 
programme for 2012-2015 touting the high quality and competitive prices of medical treatments in Poland.
Development of middle class and increasing numbers of independent, educated youth with financial means has 
boosted growth of trips to distantly located countries. Poles are becoming more open minded and ready for 
adventurous trips to undiscovered countries. The so-called "cultural tourism" is developing amongst Poles. Poles 
are increasingly interested in Asian and Middle East countries. An increasing number of Poles is fascinated with 
culture, traditions and cuisine of these countries. This shift towards new experience is expected to strengthen over 
the forecast period.
According to the National Debt Register in Poland, one out of eight travel agencies was indebted at the end of 
2012. In order to protect customers, amendments in legislation are expected to be implemented. The Ministry of 
Sport and Tourism in Poland offered to accept new requirements of higher guarantee fees for tour operators, 
verified with an increase in the number of clients, and an additional guarantee fund to which entrepreneurs would 
contribute. New amendments are expected to be enacted over the forecast period ensuring better protection of 
Polish travellers.
Poland Travel and Tourism Market: New market data available
Low-cost carriers just surpassed schedule air with the fastest value growth in 2012. Such strong performance was 
possible thanks to developing offers for price-sensitive customers and introduction of new routes. Traveling with 
transfers is not only common amongst travellers to distantly located countries on other continents but also for those 
traveling within Europe. Moreover, increasing popularity of short trips usually on weekends contributes to increase 
of low-cost carriers. Opening of the new airport in Modlin in 2012, which is tailored basically to low-cost carriers 
such as Wizz Air and Ryanair, shows high demand and a promising future outlook for this type of airline.

 Increased activity in Poland's regional airports was a significant factor influencing air transportation in Poland in 
2013. The largest airports in terms of numbers in Poland of passengers are Warsaw Chopin, Gdansk Lech Walesa 
and Kraków Balice. At the same time, only these three airports remain profitable in Poland and all other airports in 
the country are only viable due to money received from the local and regional governments.
EURO 2012, which took place in summer, was one of the most important factors having a positive impact on 
development of transportation in Poland in 2012. This applies to both air transportation, which experienced the 
fastest growth of 12% in number of passengers carried, and land transportation, where the bus/coach category saw 
the most significant current value increase of 6%. Significant increase in air transportation was also strongly 
supported by intensifying domestic tourism and introduction of new routes by major operators.
The traditional leader of the Polish air market is Polskie Linie Lotnicze LOT. Although the company still owns 21% 
of current value market sales, its share decreased by three percentage points compared with 2011. The second 
and third places are occupied by two the largest low-cost carriers operated on the Polish sky: Wizz Air and Ryanair, 
each with registered PLN1.3 billion value sales in 2012. Although these companies improved their results, they 
were not able to dominate the market as it had been forecasted some years ago. A strong market position has also 
been maintained by Deutsche Lufthansa, having a 9% value share. Two previously leading companies such as Air 
Poland and Eurocypria Airlines stopped operation in 2012.
The key forecast trend is that air transportation will be seeing continuous growth, with constant value sales 
expected to register a 7% CAGR over the forecast period. This performance will be possible owing to projected 
lasting growth both in outgoing and incoming tourism. Similarly, in terms of number of passengers the CAGR will 
amount to 6% over the entire forecast period.

 The Dow Jones industrial average and the SP 500 held their ground in record territory in afternoon trading Friday, 
while the Nasdaq poked above the 4800 level, just a smidgen from a nearly 15-year intraday high set Nov. 28.
 The Nasdaq rose 0.7%; the SP 500 gained 0.4% and the Dow climbed 0.3%. Volume was running lighter in the 
stock market today[1] compared with the same time Wednesday.
 Selected airlines had a strong day. Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY[2]) rose 1% on volume and was near a high. It 
broke out of a base in early November.
 Virgin America (NASDAQ:VA[3]) broke out of an IPO base Wednesday and followed through Friday, up nearly 7%.
 Leading biotech stocks that were pummeled earlier this week rallied Friday. They had found support at their 50-day 
moving averages. They include Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG[4]) and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD[5]), both up 
3%. Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALXN[6]) rose 2%, but was still under its 50-day line.
 Cal-Maine Foods (NASDAQ:CALM[7]) fell 5%, still feeling the effects of Tuesday's Q2 report in which revenue 
came in below Wall Street's forecast.
 GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO[8]) rose 2%, its fourth straight advance. The 180-day lock-up period in which insiders are 
prohibited from selling shares expired Monday.

 Stocks built on early gains going into the last hour of trading Friday. With little in the way of corporate 
announcements or economic data, and with many traders taking the day off, volume was dull.
 The Nasdaq rose 0.8%, the SP 500 gained 0.5%, and the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.3% in the stock 
market today[1].
 Among industry groups, gold and precious metals and automakers were among the top performers. Gold rose 2%.
 Oil drillers were among the worst performers as West Texas Intermediate oil dropped another 2%.
 Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA[2]) rose 2%. CEO Elon Musk said in a Christmas Day tweet that the new Roadster 
production vehicle would have a battery with a range of 400 miles — twice the car's range today[3].
 Select airlines had a strong day. Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY[4]) rose 1% in solid volume and was near a high. It 
broke out of a base in early November.
 Virgin America (NASDAQ:VA[5]) broke out of an IPO[6] base Wednesday and followed through Friday, up nearly 
7%.
 Leading biotech stocks, pummeled earlier in the week, rallied Friday. Several are finding support at their 50-day

Dec 26, 2014 (Zacks Investment Research:http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 On Dec 24, Zacks Investment Research upgraded United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL[1]), the parent company 
of United Airlines, to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
 
 Why the Upgrade?
 
 Ever since the Chicago, IL-based company announced robust third-quarter 2014 earnings on Oct 23, shares have 
jumped more than 31% driven by positive estimate revisions. Incidentally, United Continental has delivered positive 
earnings surprises in all of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 6.4%.
 
 In the third quarter, United Continental posted adjusted earnings of $2.75 per share, ahead of the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of $2.70. We are also impressed by the cost containment efforts of the company. United 
Continental, like many of its peers, is benefiting from low fuel costs. Fuel costs account for a major chunk of an 
airline's operating costs. Moreover, an improving economy is also benefiting carriers.
 
 We are also impressed by United Continental's efforts to expand through the launch of new routes. Only recently, 
the company announced its plans to start non-stop flights between Chicago and Rome effective May 16, 2015, 
subject to government approval. Initially, United Airlines will run five flights every week between Jun 4 and Aug 17 
and then escalate operations to six flights in the Aug 18-Sep 23 period.
 
 We expect the carrier to continue its impressive performance in 2015 as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 
2015 has moved up by $2.34 to $8.72 per share over the last 60 days, representing a 72.53% growth over the 
estimated EPS figure for 2014.
 
 Other Stocks to Consider
 
 Apart from United Continental, investors interested in the airline sector may consider stocks like Southwest Airlines 
(LUV[2]), Delta Air Lines (DAL[3]) and Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY[4]). All the three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 
(Strong Buy).

Dec 22, 2014 (Zacks Investment Research:http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 American Airlines, the wholly owned subsidiary of American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL[1]) has finally reached an 
agreement with the Association of Professional Flight Attendants - the union representing 24,000 of its flight 
attendants.
 
 The settlement follows years of negotiations between the two parties. The agreement removes a major overhang 
on the shares and marks a step ahead toward the completion of the integration process between American Airlines 
and U.S. Airways. Naturally, the news of the first labor contract after the merger impacted the company's shares 
positively.
 
 The contract covers the flight attendants of American Airlines and U.S. Airways. We remind investors that the 
merger, which was completed in late 2013, led to the formation of American Airlines Group. The merger had taken 
place after a bankruptcy filing by American Airlines. Interestingly, the merged entity has witnessed huge profits 
thereafter.
 
 Last month, the five-year contract (tentative agreement) was voted down by the flight attendants primarily because 
it did not cover a profit sharing plan. As per the tentative agreement, flight attendant costs were to be raised by 
$193 million annually. Following the rejection, arbitration meetings decided the fate of the contract.
 We remind investors that in 2012, the two parties had agreed that $112 million would be the maximum value 
necessary to ensure that the joint contract was on par with industry standards, apart from being worth at least as 
much as the individual contracts for American Airlines and U.S. Airways.
 
 The agreement with the flight attendants was finally imposed by the panel of arbitrators who met earlier this month. 
The joint contract called for $112 million in annual wage improvements for flight attendants. The wage increase 
comes into effect from Jan 1, 2015.
 
American Airlines Finalizes Labor Deal, Shares Edge Up - Analyst Blog
 According to media reports, CEO, Doug Parker, has expressed his willingness to restore the lost amount (through 
higher pay raises) to the flight attendants. The loss is due to the voting down of the higher-valued contract last 
month.
 
 However, Parker is not in favor of the profit sharing scheme and believes that wages should be raised instead. 
According to him, the profit sharing scheme is outdated and given to make up for wage cuts. We note that other 
leading carriers such as Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL[2]) and Southwest Airlines (LUV[3]) have shared profits with their

 Apart from the deal, American Airlines was also in the news recently when it inked a codeshare agreement with the 
Mexican low cost carrier Interjet. The codeshare deal is a smart move by American Airlines aimed at improving its 
network in Mexico.

 United Airlines - the wholly owned subsidiary of United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL[1]) -intends to launch 
additional flights to Shanghai and Chengdu in China. The expansion can be seen as a move intended to meet air-
travel demand which shoots up during the summer travel season.
 Subsequent to the newly launched service, the company will operate two flights a day on the Shanghai-San 
Francisco route from May 6 to Oct 24, 2015. Currently, United Airlines operates once a day on the route.
 Moreover, following government approval, the carrier will operate daily flights between San Francisco and 
Chengdu from Jun 4 to Sep 1, 2015. Currently, the carrier operates three flights a week on this route. The thrice-a-
week service will again resume from Sep 2.
 The expansion will further strengthen the existing foothold of the company in theTrans-Pacific region. We note that 
United Airlines has been operating flights to China since 1986.
 The second daily Shanghai-bound flight, scheduled to depart from San Francisco International Airport at 2.40 p.m., 
will arrive at 7.00 p.m the following day. The return flight will be of a slightly shorter duration. The Boeing 
Company's (BA[2]) 269 seater 777-200 aircraft is being used for the new service. The service, which marks the only 
nonstop connection between Houston and Santiago, is also aimed at improving the customer's flying experience. 
Each flier will get access to special in-seat entertainment on request.
 The Chengdu-bound daily flights will depart from San Francisco at 1.20 p.m and arrive at the Chinese destination 
at 6.40 p.m. the following day. The return flight will again be slightly shorter. We are optimistic about the carrier's 
decision to increase its scale of operations in recognition of increased demand, in a bid to ramp up revenues.
 Zacks Rank
 United Continental retains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some stocks that warrant a look in the airline space are 
Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV[3]) and Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY[4]). Both sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

3 French Guys Created A Titanium Airplane Seat That Could Save Airlines Millions Of Dollars
3 French Guys Created A Titanium Airplane Seat That Could Save Airlines

 Saving fuel is a key concern for airlines, and one of the main reasons United and other carriers have switched over 
to lighter seats[1] on some aircraft.
 Those seats, made by Germany's Recaro, have the extra advantage of being thinner than conventional options, so 
rows can be closer together and more paying passengers can be packed onboard.
 That's a trend in the airline industry, as carriers try to make coach as profitable as possible.
 Now, three young French guys have upped the ante with a seat that's nearly three times lighter than Recaro's.
 Benjamin Saada, Jean-Charles Samuelian, and Vincent Tejedor created Expliseat in 2011 and have now started 
selling it. Made from titanium and composites, it weighs just 4 kg (8.8 lbs).
 The Recaro seats used by United weigh 11 kg.
 The difference is enough to cut fuel consumption to the tune of up to $400,000 per plane per year, the company 
says. If that's right, putting these seats on all 300 of Ryanair's 737-800 jets could save the budget airline about $120 
million a year.
 The seat, which consists of just 30 parts and is "pre-reclined" by 18 degrees, is designed for use in the Boeing 737 
and Airbus A320 family of aircraft. Those are the most popular planes for short- and medium-haul flights and 
represent a huge market potential.
 Eariler this year, the European Aviation Safety Agency approved the seat for commercial use. At the same time, 
the startup signed its first customer. It will provide 220 seats for an A321 flown by charter airline Air Méditerranée, 
according to French newspaper LesEchos[2].

United Kingdom Scheduled Passenger Air Transport Market: Revenue

 The Scheduled Passenger Air Transport industry includes all companies that transport passengers over domestic 
or international routes on regular timetables. The performance of the industry is affected by factors like consumer 
and business confidence, household income and airfare price levels. When sentiment is up and income is rising, 
demand for all travel tends to increase, leading to more passengers on planes. Consumers' price sensitivity to air 
travel means that low airfares boost demand. Over the five years through 2013-14, the industry has been buffeted 
by rising input costs and increased price competition, which has squeezed operator's margins. Analysts expect 
industry revenue to grow at a compound annual rate of 0.7% over the five years through 2013-14 to reach £19.8...
The industry has a high level of capital intensity. Operators are expected to spend approximately £2.37 on labour 
for every £1 invested in new capital. Airlines invest heavily on aircraft and other machinery and equipment, 
especially in times of fleet replacement. However, the average aircraft has a life of approximately 20 years, which 
minimises the rate of capital turnover. Industry labour requirements are reasonably high, with wages estimated to 
represent 16.1% of revenue. Staff are needed for duties such as piloting, flight attendance, ground handling, 
customer services, administration and management. There have been major technological improvements in 
administration, including online ticketing and check-in...

 Over the past 5 trading days, major airline stocks continued their northward movement aided by weak oil prices. 
However, the gains were muted by the massive sell-off witnessed by the industry yesterday.
 The sell-off was triggered by Spirit Airlines, Inc.'s (SAVE[1]) statement that it was witnessing pricing pressures due 
to the industry's tendency to utilize the falling oil prices to lower air fares for attracting passengers. The statement 
was issued by the company while releasing its November traffic data.
 The company said that it is facing competition primarily from Southwest Airlines (LUV[2]) following the expiration of 
the Wright Amendment in Oct 2014. The Wright Amendment, established in 1979, originally governed traffic at 
Dallas Love Field (Southwest's home base) and restricted non-stop flights from Love Field to destinations only in 
Texas and the neighboring states.
 However, we are not too perturbed by the sell-off and view it as a singular event. Additionally, the company 
expects operating margin in the range of 18%-19%. This is still a healthy range, only 0.5% lower than its old 
guidance of 18.5%-19.5%.
 Apart from Spirit Airlines, most other carriers also invited attention during the period with their November traffic 
releases. Overall, the airline sector is going through good times with stocks having rebounded strongly from the 
lean period aided by healthy earnings reports, weak oil prices and the holiday season.
 While companies like Southwest Airlines, Alaska Air Group (ALK[3]) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU[4]) came up with 
healthy rise in traffic, data released by carriers like United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL[5]) and American Airlines 
Group (AAL[6]) was subdued. American Airlines' decision to spend over $2 billion to upgrade planes and hubs to 
improve the flying experience of its passengers and keep up with competitors also grabbed headlines.

 Moreover, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY[7]) was also in the news during the period 
again due to traffic related data. The carrier came out with solid traffic numbers for November and consequently 
hiked its profit forecast for fiscal 2015 (ending Mar 31, 2015).
 (Read last to last week's developments here: Airline Stock Roundup for Dec 3, 2014[8])
 Recap of Most Important Stories of the Last 5 Trading Days
 1. European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings reported solid traffic data for the month of November on the back of 
its customer friendly 'Always Getting Better' scheme. Following the impressive performance in the in the first month 
of its expanded winter schedule, the carrier raised its full year profit (after-tax) projection to the range of €810 million 
and €830 million from the €750 million-€770 million range guided last month (read more: Ryanair Soars on 
November Traffic, Raises Profit Forecast[9]).
 2. American Airlines Group reported disappointing traffic numbers for the month of November hurt by weak 
international travel. Moreover, the carrier announced that it will invest over $2 billion to renovate airport lounges, 
modernize ticket counters apart from deploying satellite-based internet access on its international flights. The 
company is also looking to make certain other changes to improve the in-flight experience, primarily to attract the 
high-paying frequent flyers and keep up with competitors (read more: American Airlines Announces $2B Upgrade 
Plan[10]).
 3. United Continental Holdings reported a marginal dip in its Nov 2014 traffic due to a fall in domestic travel. 
Consolidated airline traffic - measured in revenue passenger miles or RPMs - declined 0.3% year over year to 
19.28 billion (read more: United Continental November Traffic Down, Domestic Soft[11]). 
 United Continental was also in the news when it launched a route in a bid to expand further and improve customer 
convenience. Subsequent to the newly launched service, the company is now operating daily flights from the 
intercontinental airport at Houston to the Chilean capital of Santiago. The news impacted the stock positively (read 
more: United Airlines Adds Routes to Latin America, Shares Up[12]).
 4. Southwest Airlines witnessed an increase in air traffic in the month of November. Traffic came in at 10.90 billion, 
up 4.2% year-over-year. Southwest Airlines witnessed considerable growth in PRASM (passenger revenue per 
available seat mile) in the month mainly driven by significant increase in air travels during the Thanksgiving season 
(read more: Southwest Airlines' November Traffic Up on Thanksgiving[13]).
 5. Alaska Air Group reported impressive traffic data for Nov 2014 buoyed by strong demand. The company's 
consolidated airline traffic moved up 9.4% year over year to 2,475 million. Consolidated capacity increased 8.7% 
from Nov 2013 to 3,009 million. Load factor for the company improved 60 basis points from Nov 2013 to 82.3% 
(read more: Alaska Air Group November Traffic Rises on Higher Demand[14]).
 6. JetBlue Airways' traffic for November climbed 10.1% on a year over year basis, on a 6% capacity increase. Load 
factor for the company improved 310 basis points to 81.4 % in November 2014. PRASM climbed 6% year over 
year. The company expects PRASM in the final quarter of the year to decrease in the range of 0% and 1% on a 
year-over-year basis.
 In a bid to expand further, JetBlue announced that it intends to launch a new flight (twice daily) between Boston 
Logan International airport and Cleveland Hopkins International airport on April 30 of next year. The company has 
initially priced the air tickets at $19.51 each for Cleveland bound flights from Apr 30 to Jun 18. The company said 
that tickets must be purchased before Dec 10 to avail of the low fare.

 As of late, it has definitely been a great time to be an investor in Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY[1]). The stock has 
moved higher by 8.3% in the past month, while it is also above its 20 Day SMA too. This combination of strong price 
performance and favorable technical, could suggest that the stock may be on the right path.
 
 We certainly think that this might be the case, particularly if you consider RYAAY's recent earnings estimate 
revision activity. From this look, the company's future is quite favorable; as RYAAY has earned itself a Zacks Rank 
#1 (Strong Buy), meaning that its recent run may continue for a bit longer, and that this isn't the top for the in-focus 
company.

 In the past week, Boeing[1] (NYSE:BA) received an order for 100 737 MAX 200s from Ryan Air. Separately, GE 
Aviation formed a joint venture with Turbocoating SPA of Italy to produce thermal coatings for Ceramix Matrix 
Composite (CMC) components used in jet engines.
 Boeing
 On Monday, December 1, Boeing received an order for 100 737 MAX 200s from Ryan Air. At a list price of $107 
million per airplane, this order translates to business worth $10.7 billion for Boeing. The 737 MAX 200 is the high 
density version of the company's 737 MAX 8, which seats about 175 passengers in a single class cabin 
configuration. The 737 MAX 200, on the other hand, can seat up to 200 passengers and has been named after its 
seating capacity. Boeing launched this version of the MAX 8 in September this year, in response to the demand 
from low-cost carriers (LCCs). LCCs like Southwest[2] (NYSE:LUV) and Ryan Air like to maximize the number of 
on-board seats, and Boeing's 737 MAX 200 will allow these carriers to do so, growing revenue potential per 
airplane and improving fuel efficiency per seat.
 Importantly, this large order from Ryan Air allows Boeing's 737 MAX to close the gap with Airbus' A320 neo, which 
has obtained firm orders for 3,124 airplanes since its launch in 2010. In comparison, the Boeing 737 MAX has 
obtained orders for slightly over 2,550 airplanes, including this latest one from Ryan Air. We figure orders for the 
737 MAX lag behind those for the A320 neo as the latter was launched by Airbus a full year before Boeing launched 
the 737 MAX. Gains from that launch lead are still accruing to Airbus, positioning its A320 neo in lead in terms of 
total orders. However, 737 MAX's steadily growing order book will play a key role in allowing Boeing to retain its 
share in the single-aisle airplane segment of the global commercial airplane market.
 - We currently have a stock price estimate of $136 for Boeing, marginally above its current market price.
 - Boeing's stock has fallen by about 1% over the past week.
 - We currently estimate Boeing to post earnings of $8.21 per share in 2014, compared with its mean consensus 
earnings estimate of $8.36 per share.

 General Electric
 Separately, GE[5] (NYSE:GE) has formed a 50/50 joint venture (JV) with Turbocoating SPA of Italy. This JV 
will provide thermal barrier coatings for CMC components used in jet engines. The coatings from this JV will be 
supplied for LEAP engines, manufactured by CFM International, which is a 50/50 joint venture between GE Aviation 
Aviation Week In Review: Boeing and GE
and Snecma of France. LEAP is the first commercial jet engine that uses heat-resistant CMCs in the turbine 
section. These light-weight CMCs weigh significantly less than metal alloys that have been traditionally used in the 
turbine section of jet engines. As a result, the LEAP engine weighs considerably less, providing higher fuel 
efficiency. These engines are the key driver behind the higher fuel efficiency promised by next generation single-
aisle airplanes of both Boeing and Airbus - Boeing 737MAX and Airbus A320neo.
 The contrasting routes taken by GE Aviation and Snecma on the one hand, and Pratt Whitney on the other hand, 
to make their jet engines more fuel efficient are quite interesting. While GE Avation and Snecma have resorted to 
making their engines from new material that weighs less and can burn fuel at higher temperatures. Pratt Whitney 
has introduced a gear in its engine (Geared Turbo Fan engine) that improves fuel efficiency. However, GE 
Aviaiton/Snecma's LEAP has been picked by both Boeing and Airbus for their next generation single-aisle 
airplanes, while Pratt Whitney's GTF has been picked by only Airbus for its A320 neo (the A320 neo allows airlines 
to choose between CFM's LEAP engine and Pratt Whitney's GTF engine).
 The Airbus A320 neo is set to enter service late next year and Boeing 737 MAX is expected to enter service in 
2017. So, as CFM International ramps up production of the LEAP engine in coming years, this newly formed 
coating JV will enable GE to exercise greater control over its supply chain. We figure this increased control over 
supply chain is important as GE Aviation will derive a growing portion of its sales from the LEAP engine.
 - We currently have a stock price estimate of $28 for GE, around 5% ahead of its current market price.
 - GE's stock has fallen by about 3% in the past week.
 - We currently estimate GE to post earnings of $1.69 per share in 2014, compared with its mean consensus 
earnings estimate of $1.67 per share.

Ryanair Soars on November Traffic, Raises Profit Forecast - Analyst Blog

Dec 05, 2014 (Zacks Investment Research:http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 Shares of European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY[1]) climbed over 7% on Nasdaq to end the Dec 
4 trading session at $68.08. The northward movement seems to be an outcome of the company's decision to hike 
its profit forecast for fiscal 2015 (ending Mar 31, 2015) for the second time in the space of one month. In fact, this is 
the third time in the year that the company has raised its profit forecast for fiscal 2015.
 
 Did the November Performance Lead to the Guidance Hike?
 
 Driven by its customer friendly 'Always Getting Better' scheme, the Ireland-based airline reported solid traffic data 
for the month of November. The carrier's traffic climbed 22% to 6.35 million passengers in the month. Load factor 
(percentage of seats filled by passengers) climbed to 88% from 81% a year ago. Seat capacity increased 13% year 
over year in Nov 2014.
 
 Following the strong numbers, the company now expects its traffic for fiscal 2015 to be marginally more than 90 
million customers (previous guidance: 89 million). Moreover, the impressive performance in the first month of its 
expanded winter schedule prompted the company to raise its full year profit (after-tax) projection to the range of 
€810 million and €830 million from the €750 million-€770 million range guided last month.
 The company, however, stated that the fulfillment of its raised profit forecast is dependent on the bookings and 
yields in the final quarter of fiscal 2015 (Jan-Mar). The carrier also stated that it currently has very little visibility 
regarding the factors. We note that the company had made a profit of €523 million in fiscal 2014.
 
 Ryan Air - More Customer-Friendly Now
 
 The better-than-expected performance of Ryanair in November this year completes a perfect reversal of fortunes 
for the Irish airline company. In 2013, the company had undergone troubled times due to lower passenger numbers. 
To come out of the woods, the company undertook multiple customer friendly measures like allowing more carry-on 
baggage, introducing allocated seating and reducing penalties.
Ryanair Soars on November Traffic, Raises Profit Forecast - Analyst Blog
 Moreover, in May 2014, Michael O' Leary, the chief executive officer of the company, launched its new website 
which has simplified the procedure to book flight tickets. Moreover, regular Ryanair travelers can store information 
pertaining to their travel documents and payment card on the site.
 
 The carrier, which is already operating on a number of new routes to expand its business, is looking to expand 
further and fly on business-popular routes. In a bid to expand further, Ryanair placed an order to The Boeing 
Company (BA[2]) to purchase 100 737 MAX 200 aircraft from the latter. Ryanair has options to purchase another 
100 aircraft (read more: Boeing Rises on $22 Billion 737 MAX 200 Order from Ryanair[3]).
 
 Zacks Rank
 
 Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the airline space include SkyWest Inc. (SKYW[4]) 
and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV[5]). Both these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

 One stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY[1]). This is 
because this security in the transport space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity, and is in great 
company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective.
 
This is important because, often times, a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry, as there can be broad trends 
taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board. This is arguably taking place in the 
transport space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 19 out of more than 250 industries, suggesting it is 
well-positioned from this perspective, especially when compared to other segments out there.
 
Meanwhile, Ryanair Holdings is actually looking pretty good on its own too. The firm has seen solid earnings 
estimate revision activity over the past month, suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm's 
prospects in both the short and long term.
 
In fact, over the past month, current quarter estimates have narrowed from a loss of 25 cents a share to a loss of 18 
cents a share, while current year estimates have risen from $3.28 a share to $3.43 a share. The company currently 
carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which is also a favorable signal.
 
So, if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry, consider Ryanair Holdings. Not only is its industry 
currently in the top third, but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late, suggesting it could be a very interesting 
choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment.

Lufthansa pilots' strike hits long haul flights and cargo
Lufthansa pilots' strike hits long haul flights and cargo

Dec 04, 2014 (Deutsche Welle Germany:http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)
 Lufthansa pilots have gone on strike for the tenth time this year, leading to cancellations for passengers booked on 
long-distance flights. The action was not expected to affect domestic or European flights. German pilots' union 
Vereinigung Cockpit staged another strike beginning at 3 a.m. local time (0200 UTC) on Thursday and lasting until 
midnight the same day.
 A spokesman for German carrier Lufthansa said the strike would affect flights from Düsseldorf, Frankfurt and 
Munich. Only long haul and cargo flights were expected to be affected.
 The dust has barely settled after a walkout on Monday and Tuesday that forced Lufthansa to cancel half its flights. 
That round of action affected about 150,000 passengers.
 Pilots have been staging strikes over recent months, with the union and the airline so far unable to reach a deal on 
early retirement. The carrier is seeking to raise the standard retirement age of pilots, who can now leave the job at 
55 on 60 percent of their full pay before retiring at 65.
 "Vereinigung Cockpit expects a clear commitment by management to draft fairer conditions for young pilots," the 
union said on its website in a statement announcing the latest strike.
 Lufthansa on Wednesday offered mediation with the pilots with the aim of possibly resolving the dispute in time for 
the Christmas holiday season.
 Meanwhile, against the backdrop of deteriorating staff relations, the airline's board on Wednesday approved plans 
to expand its budget operations on long haul flights.
 The carrier is struggling to remain competitive against budget carriers such as Ryanair and Easyjet on the 
domestic and European market. Further afield, on the more lucrative long-haul flights, it faces tough competition 
from Middle Eastern carriers such as Emirates, Etihad and Qatar.

 Stocks took a turn for the worse near Thursday's midday, as the Nasdaq erased gains.
 The SP 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.5% each. Both wiped out all of Wednesday's gains and 
then some. The Nasdaq fell 0.3% after giving up a 0.2% gain. Volume was tracking lower on both major exchanges 
in the stock market today[1].
 The European Central Bank's decision to hold back on stimulus until next year[2] was weighing on the U.S. stock 
market.
 Leaders down in volume were few, but Biogen Idec (NASDAQ:BIIB[3]) lost 2% after reversing from an eight-month 
high. The biotech had surged in the past two sessions on encouraging data from an experimental Alzheimer's drug. 
Biogen Idec cleared a 347.85 buy point from a cup base within a bigger pattern earlier in the session.
 BitAuto (NYSE:BITA[4]) turned tail and fell nearly 2% in fast trade. The reversal also put the stock back below its 
50-day moving average regained Wednesday. On Monday, BitAuto erased a 14% gain past an 85.76 cup-with-
handle buy point and it fell 9% below the 85.76 trigger. Both were sell signals.
 On the upside, Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY[5]) was off its session highs, but still up 7% after raising its outlook. The 
company now sees after-tax profit coming in at 810 million to 830 million euros from a prior range of 750 million to 
770 million. The stock is now 16% past a 58.75 buy point from a cup within a larger pattern. Shares of the Irish 
airline were up as much as 10% at Thursday's high.
 Other airlines such as United Continental (NYSE:UAL[6]) and Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK[7]) were up 6% and 2%, 
respectively, as crude oil fell more than 1%.

 Today we'll learn more about whether Mr Draghi becomes Super Mario in the near future as the widely anticipated 
ECB meeting is now only a few hours away. We will do another summary preview of market expectations shortly, 
but in a nutshell, nobody really expects Draghi to announce anything today although the jawboning is expected to 
reach unseen levels. The reason is that Germany is still staunchly against outright public QE, and Draghi probably 
wants to avoid an outright legal confrontation. As DB notes, assuming no new policy moves, the success of today's 
meeting will probably depend on the degree to which Draghi indicates the need for more action soon and the 
degree to which that feeling is unanimous within the council. Over the past weekend Weidmann's comment about 
falling oil prices representing a form of stimulus highlights that this consensus is still proving difficult to build. It might 
need a couple more months of low growth and inflation, revised staff forecasts and a stubbornly slow balance sheet 
accumulation to cement action. 
 As if hypnotized by Draghi's perpetual inability to actually do anything (as opposed to say), a massive barrier of 
selling has emerged at the 120 level in the USDJPY. It will surely be taken out later today in a major stop hunt, 
which will in turn push US futures, whether bought by central banks or not, to new record highs, while the Japanese 
currency ploughs on to SocGen's point of no return, first at 123 then at 145, and then at #Div/0. Another question 
has emreged on European bonds: if and when Draghi does finally implement sovereign QE, will that be the signal to 
sell everything? Judging by the reaction in the US fixed income market, bonds have sold the news in each of the 
previous 3 QE episodes. Why should Europe be any different?
 European equities have lacked direction and remain marginally higher ahead of today's ECB BoE rate decision 
with both central banks expected not to take any action. On a sector basis, consumer discretionary is the best 
performer, however energy stocks have been lagging as the FTSE 100 marginally underperforms given its large 
gearing toward resource based firms. In stock specific news, Ryanair opened the session significantly higher 
trading as high as 8.5% after raising their FY profit forecast with easyJet higher by 2.4% in sympathy with the move.
 In Fixed income, Bunds have traded sideways and remained relatively unchanged as this morning's session which 
has been directionless aided by the lack of pertinent macro news ahead of the ECB press conference. Elsewhere, 
the Spanish Tresoro sold a total of EUR 3.5bln as the Spanish 10y printed a record low yield at 1.840%; the French 
Tresor selling combined 4bln in 2023, 2025 and 2027 bonds as expected. Ahead of the ECB conference, analysts

at Credit Suisse say risks are skewed toward ECB under-delivering on investors' expectations for sovereign QE 
given recent moves in EUR rates market. 
 In China, equity markets are extending their gains to 3 year highs with the strong performance overnight being 
largely driven by large caps and brokers. The CSI 300, Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Composite are up 
+2.9%, +2.3% and +1.6% overnight to be up +31%, +34% and +39% YTD. Money market rates were lower in China 
overnight whilst expectations of a RRR cut seems to be building up. In terms of year to date performance in Asian 
equities, China has closed the gap sharply and is not that far off from the Modi-driven rally in India and would say 
those two markets are broadly on par now. Whilst on this our Asian economists now expect China to decelerate 
from 7.3% in 2014 to 6.9%yoy in 2015H1, dragged by weak property investment. Contingent on supportive policy 
actions, they see risks to the outlook as balanced. Lagged effects of monetary policy easing, together with more 
expansionary fiscal policy, will pull up GDP growth to 7.2% in 2015H2. In India, data show an economy still treading 
sideways, but sharply rising consumer and business sentiment bodes well for the cycle. An investment recovery 
and re-acceleration in consumption seem likely in the coming year.
 In summary, today's key drivers and changes: ECB, Bank of England meetings today. Ruble erased gains; Putin 
gives annual speech. U.K. house price growth slowed last month. The Dutch and French markets are the best-
performing larger bourses, Swedish the worst. The euro is little changed against the dollar. German 10yr bond 
yields rise; Spanish yields increase. Commodities gain, with natural gas, wheat underperforming and nickel 
outperforming. U.S. jobless claims due later.

 In the FX market, EUR/USD initially fell below the 1.2300 handle before staging a recovery to trade back above 
Aug. 2012 lows, a move primarily attributed to the pullback from multiyear highs observed in the USD-index. 
Elsewhere, USD/JPY remains in close proximity to the 120.00 level to the upside, which is a large size option expiry

(2.1bln) for today's 10am NY cut (1500GMT). Moreover, the RUB has weakened this morning following a public 
address from Russian President Putin who appeared to blame the West for the situation in Ukraine. Overnight, the 
AUD/USD traded slightly weaker, ignoring stronger retail sales as more banks look for more cuts from the RBA.
 COMMODITIES
 The metals complex shows divergence among spot gold and silver following Russian President Putin's somewhat 
aggressive statements blaming the West for the ongoing problems in Ukraine. Furthermore, Platinum trades higher 
by around 1% helped by the slight strength of the RUB as Russia is the second largest producer of the metal. In 
precious metal related news, earlier reports emerged that China are said to consider loosening restrictions on gold 
imports, according to Bloomberg. The energy complex has been relatively quiet with the USD broadly flat with 
direction on the session to be dictated by the open of the NYMEX pit.
 DB's Jim Reid concludes the overnight recap
 Today we'll learn more about whether Mr Draghi becomes Super Mario in the near future as the widely anticipated 
ECB meeting is now only a few hours away. DB's Mark Wall is not expecting anything concrete to be delivered with 
no new commitments to asset purchasing or tweaks to the tLTRO terms. He thinks that the council remains in wait 
and see mode until the impact of the current ABS/covered purchase programmes and take up from the Dec 11th 
tLTRO2 are known. Mark's team continue to believe that a broad based asset purchase scheme (including 
Government bonds) will be announced by the end of Q1 but unlikely before. Assuming no new policy moves, the 
success of today's meeting will probably depend on the degree to which Draghi indicates the need for more action 
soon and the degree to which that feeling is unanimous within the council. Over the past weekend Weidmann's 
comment about falling oil prices representing a form of stimulus highlights that this consensus is still proving difficult 
to build. It might need a couple more months of low growth and inflation, revised staff forecasts and a stubbornly 
slow balance sheet accumulation to cement action. 
 In terms of trading, given that I'm confident broad based QE is coming I don't think setting up for disappointment 
today is a particularly fruitful policy. It might work for a short while but given the illiquidty, especially in assets like 
credit, one would have to be confident of a big move wider in the short-term or a view that the ECB will never quite 
be able to pull the trigger. We think we'll get a few small hints today and the trigger in Q1. As such we continue to 
be bullish European credit.
 Away from Europe and the ECB, the recent Fed speak on balance has been viewed to be more hawkish than what 
the market was prepared for. Indeed earlier this week we heard from both Dudley and Fischer who seemed keen to 
emphasise that that normalisation of short term rates is just a matter of time. Yesterday Philly Fed's Plosser noted 
that US recovery is well advanced and that means 'we should no longer be conducting monetary policy as if we 
were still in the midst of a financial crisis or in the depths of a recession'. He added that 'Keeping the funds rate 
target near zero when inflation is close to our goal and the economy is near full employment is both unprecedented 
and risky'.
 Speaking on financial market stability and in her first public address since joining the Fed, Governor Lael Brainard 
also said that Fed should be prudent and circumspect in using monetary policy to combat financial stability risks 
because of its broad effects on the economy. Treasuries bear flattened modestly overnight in reaction to these 
comments with the 2yr closing 2bp higher at 0.55% with the 10yr falling 1bp to 2.28%. The June 2016 Fed Funds 
implied rate is 8.5bp higher this week.
 In terms of other markets equities were higher on both sides of the Atlantic. The SP 500 (+0.38%) and Dow 
(+0.18%) made new highs whilst the Stoxx600 was more than half a percent higher on the day. Brent was lower 
once more to close just below US$70/bbl whilst WTI was slightly higher on an unexpected decline in US crude 
inventory. Energy stocks added another 1% to be up for a third day in a row. Its hard to say if we are forming a 
bottom here but it does seem that the correlation between crude oil and energy stocks have somewhat faded in 
recent days.
 Switching to Asia, Japan's upcoming election and the ongoing rally in Chinese equities are the two notable market 
themes for now. On Japan local polls are pointing towards a landslide victory for PM Shinzo Abe's ruling LDP in the 
Dec 14th parliamentary elections. Local polls by four news outlets all showed that LDP was set to win around 300 
seats in the 475-seat lower house. A convincing victory should strengthen the government's mandate for 
Abenomics and increases the prospect of PM Abe staying in office through 2018. Indeed in a scenario where LDP 
wins 295 or more seats our Japanese macro strategist thinks equities could rise sharply and JPY will weaken more 
with temporary upward pressure on JGB yields due to further currency depreciation.
Algo Eyes On Draghi Ahead Of ECB Announcement
 In China, equity markets are extending their gains to 3 year highs with the strong performance overnight being 
largely driven by large caps and brokers. The CSI 300, Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Composite are up 
+2.9%, +2.3% and +1.6% overnight to be up +31%, +34% and +39% YTD. Money market rates were lower in China 
overnight whilst expectations of a RRR cut seems to be building up. In terms of year to date performance in Asian 
equities, China has closed the gap sharply and is not that far off from the Modi-driven rally in India and would say

sideways, but sharply rising consumer and business sentiment bodes well for the cycle. An investment recovery 
and re-acceleration in consumption seem likely in the coming year.
 Away from Asia, the Russian Ruble bounced off its record lows yesterday on reports of central bank intervention. 
Russia's central bank yesterday said that it spent US$700m of its FX reserves to support the currency on Monday 
which also marks its first intervention since fully free floating the Ruble on Nov 10. The currency hit another fresh 
low against the Dollar of 54.87 yesterday morning before recovering to close at around 53.2. The Ruble is still the 
worst performer in the EM world this year though after having lost around 38% of its value against the US Dollar. Its 
a similar story in the EM credit space with Russia 5Y CDS being the standout laggard amongst peers. Russia CDS 
is around 120bp wider this year which compares with the c.35-40bps YTD spread tightening in Indonesia, Hungary, 
Thailand and Turkey.
 Moving onto today, we have more Fed speak to look forward to with Fisher (on the Texas economy and monetary 
policy), Mester (opening remarks at a Financial Stability conference) and Brainard (keynote address on Financial 
stability) lined up for today. Weekly jobless claims will be the only notable release ahead of tomorrow's NFP. All 
eyes will be on ECB today as previewed above although we also have the BoE's policy meeting although 
consensus is not looking for any major changes there.

Lufthansa to offer budget long-haul flights next year

 Germany's Lufthansa has pushed ahead with plans to beef up its low-cost credentials. An announcement that the 
airline would begin offering budget long-haul flights came amid a bitter labor dispute with its pilots. Lufthansa's 
board on Wednesday gave the go-ahead to expand its portfolio of budget flights as the German airline tries to 
remain competitive amid unrelenting rivalry with other low-cost operators.
 The green light to offer more inexpensive long-haul flights at the end of next year came amid an ongoing dispute 
between the flagship carrier and its pilots over early retirement schemes that has been marked by acrimony and 
nine strikes to date.
 And there is already a tenth strike lined up for tomorrow, the second time the pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit will 
walk off the job this week.
 Industrial action stemming from the current labor dispute has already knocked 160 million euros ($198 million) off 
Lufthansa's operating profit for this year.
 The company is eager to keep ticket prices down in a changing industry where budget airlines like Ryanair and 
EasyJet plan an ever-greater role. But its pilots say it is slashing costs in the wrong places - such as on their 
pension schemes.
 On Wednesday, the company's board went ahead with plans to expand its little-known regional airline Eurowings, 
and said Lufthansa will also offer the first long-distance flights to Florida, southern Africa and destinations in the 
Indian Ocean by late 2015 under a new low-cost brand.
 The company aims to use the Eurowings brand as a platform hosting the Eurowings, Germanwings - which offers 
cheap domestic and European flights - and the Turkish Airlines joint venture Sun-Express.

Boeing Receives Ryanair's Confirmation for 737 MAX 200 Jets - Analyst Blog

Dec 02, 2014 (Zacks Investment Research:http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 The world's leading commercial aircraft maker, The Boeing Company (BA[1]) has received a confirmation from 
Ryanair, (RYAAY[2]) the European low-cost carrier to supply 100 units of 737 MAX 200 for $11 billion at list prices.
 
 The order was first announced in Sep, 2014. (Read more: Boeing Rises on $22 Billion 737 MAX 200 Order from 
Ryanair[3]). It includes options for another 100 737 MAX 200 jets. With this order, Ryanair will become the launch 
customer for Boeing's 737 MAX 200.
 
 737 MAX 200: The Latest 737 Entrant
 
 The 737 MAX 200 is an upgraded version of the 737 MAX 8. This new variant has the capacity to house 200 
passengers, 11 more than the existing 737 jets. Higher capacity will enable Ryanair to increase passenger traffic to 
150 million by 2024.
 
 Moreover, the jets are powered by Commercial Fan Motor International LEAP-1B engines and Advanced 
Technology winglets to enhance performance.
 
 Additionally, the pivoting overhead stowage bins are designed to increase cabin space. These bins give 
passengers more room to keep a carry-on roll-aboard near their own seat besides increasing leg space.
 
 This aircraft is also 20% more fuel efficient than its peers in the single-aisle aircraft market.
 
 Is Boeing eyeing the Low-Cost Carrier Market with the new 737- MAX 200?
 
 We believe the latest fuel-efficient 737 MAX plane will boost revenues for Ryanair, by reducing its operating costs 
by 5% compared with 737 MAX 8. In addition, the extra leg room will enhance passenger satisfaction and thereby, 
drive customer loyalty.
 
Boeing Receives Ryanair 's Confirmation for 737 MAX 200 Jets - Analyst Blog
 The low-cost carrier market is witnessing tremendous growth. Rising traffic pattern attributable to higher business 
activities is expected to accelerate the demand for these airplanes significantly. Moreover, it is expected that low-
cost carriers will make up for 35% of single-aisle airline capacity by 2033.
 
 Needless to say, Boeing wants to grab its share in the growing low-cost carrier market. This has encouraged the 
company to roll out the premier 737 MAX 200 jets.
 
 Recently, Boeing announced that it will boost the 737 output to 52 airplanes per month in 2018, up from the 
existing 42 and from the planned level of 48 in 2017. Boeing already has orders for more than 2,550 737 MAXs.
 
 Zacks Rank
 
 Boeing carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-placed stocks in the same sector include General Dynamics 
Corp. (GD[4]) and Engility Holdings, Inc. (EGL[5]). Both these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Dec 01, 2014 (The Business Insider:http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 Good morning! It's Cyber Monday![1] Here is everything you need to know before your first meeting of the day.
1. Police and pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong have clashed again. Police used pepper spray on the crowd. 
Thousands of activists forced the temporary closure of Hong Kong's government building. 40 arrested, Reuters 
reports[2].
 2. Black Friday shopping appears to have declined 11% in the US. The Washington Post says:[3] "The National 
Retail Federation reported that 55.1 percent of consumers shopped between Thursday and Sunday, according to a 
survey it conducted over the weekend. That is down from 58.7 percent the previous year. The NRF said total 
spending was $50.9 billion, an 11 percent decline from an estimated $57.4 billion in 2013." One theory: Shoppers 
no longer believe that deals will only be available on the Friday and are instead spreading their buying across the 
weeks leading up to Christmas.
 3. UK manufacturers are moderating their growth expectations. A survey of manufacturers by EEF and BDO says 
companies predict growth of 3.5 per cent this year for the sector but that will slow to 2 per cent in 2015, the 
Financial Times says[4].
 4. Chinese manufacturing looks weak. Business Insider's Linette Lopez reported[5]: "Chinese manufacturing 
disappointed again in November. The country's manufacturing PMI missed expectations coming in at 50.3, analysts 
expected 50.5." It's the second straight month where PMI has been near 50. Any measure under 50 indicates the 
sector is contracting.
 5. The Swiss have rejected the gold standard. In a national referendum on Sunday that was closely watched by 
gold bugs — people who believe that currency should be tied to the actual value of gold — Switzerland rejected a 
proposal to link the Swiss franc to gold reserves held by the country's central bank[6].
 6. An American couple cleared of killing their daughter has nonetheless been barred from leaving Qatar. It's an 
unusual case: Prosecutors in the Muslim country accused the pair of starving to death their adopted daughter. The 
8-year-old girl alternately starved and binged on food, a behaviour the couple was trying to correct. The Huangs are 
Asian and their adopted daughter was black — a situation prosecutors appeared not to understand. The couple 
spent a year in a Qatari jail[7] before they were cleared by a court. Their passports were taken at the airport even 
though they were being escorted by the US ambassador[8].
The 10 Most Important Things In The World This Morning
 7. Samsung is planning another new metal phone. The next iteration of its A series will have a screen bigger than 5 
inches, Business Insider noted[9].
 8. Samsung's mobile division chief kept his job! The company had been expected to axe Shin Jong-kyun because 
the company's phone sales have declined. But they left him in place in the annual reshuffle[10].
 9. Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, has been told to tone it down. O'Leary is known for his media-
friendly statements about charging passengers to use the toilet and turning up to press conferences in bizarre 
costumes. Now the company wants him to become a bit more "presidential" in his behaviour.[11]
 10. United Nations diplomats will gather in Lima to again attempt to persuade governments to restrict their 
emission of greenhouse gases. The problem is that we may have already passed the point of no return, and that 
the planet faces a future of "drought, food and water shortages, melting ice sheets, shrinking glaciers, rising sea 
levels and widespread flooding," according to The New York Times[12].
 And finally ...
 The organisers of an art project during which actor Shia Labeouf claims he was raped have spoken out against the 
woman who allegedly assaulted him. 'Nowhere did we state that people could do whatever they wanted to Shia 
during #IAMSORRY", one of them tweeted[13]. The Guardian reports: "#IAMSORRY involved LaBeouf sitting 
silently behind a desk in a room in LA's Cohen gallery with a paper bag bearing the legend 'I am not famous 
anymore' over his head. For five days, members of the public queued to be able to sit alone with him in the room 
with a prop of their choice." One woman whipped him and took his clothes off, The Guardian says.

 Crewe-based The Travel Visa Company has won a major contract to be the preferred supplier of business and 
tourist visas for Cardiff Airport. 
 This new significant partnership with Cardiff Airport will ensure both tourists and business travellers can access the 
correct documentation when visiting countries with specific visa requirements. 
 Markedly, this latest move follows hot on the heels of The Travel Visa Company being appointed earlier in the year 
as the preferred supplier of visas for passengers departing from Birmingham Airport. 
 Cardiff Airport welcomes over a million passengers a year, serving scheduled airlines and charter tour operators. 
The Airport offers direct flights to over 50 destinations worldwide, and more than 900 destinations are available 
worldwide with connections via airports such as Amsterdam Schiphol and Dublin. 
 Following its purchase by the Welsh Government in 2013, Cardiff Airport has undergone a number of changes and 
improvements to enhance the customer experience, including transforming parts the terminal building, improving 
the car park infrastructure and welcoming new airlines - Cityjet and Ryanair. 
 With over 14 years' experience and longstanding relationships with Embassies, High Commissions and Consulates 
in London, Birmingham and Manchester, The Travel Visa Company will offer a bespoke service for travellers 
departing from Cardiff Airport, including personally collecting visas directly from embassies and delivering them to 
business and leisure customers.
 The Travel Visa Company will feature on the Cardiff Airport's recently launched new website alongside need-to-
know visa information and details on how to apply for country specific visas directly with the specialist. 
 Philip Ashwell, Head of Sales at The Travel Visa Company, says: 'We are thrilled to be now supporting Cardiff 
Airport and their passengers. It's a major contract win for the group, and builds upon our growing sector expertise in 
this area. 'The application process for visas can be time consuming, complicated and frustrating. We undertake the 
hard work for travellers and we assist in eliminating the stresses that the lengthy application process entails. 
 'Visa requirements are ever changing, and differ vastly from territory to territory. Our relationship with Cardiff 
Airport means we can ensure the public have all the correct documentation in a timely fashion prior to visiting their 
destination.' 
 As the favoured supplier to the UK's leading travel brands, specialising in both tourist and business visas, The 
Travel Visa Company, founded by Karen Taylor and Ray Ward in 2005, currently employs 15 staff at its head office 
in Crewe and corporate visa division in Manchester city centre.

EasyJet logs sound full-year profits

Nov 18, 2014 (Deutsche Welle Business:http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)
 No-frills British airline EasyJet has reported growing profits on the back of rising passenger numbers. The carrier 
picked up some business from rival Air France-KLM whose pilots had staged a record-long strike. Cheap fares 
helped EasyJet win market share in the European short-haul travel sector, the British budget air line said Tuesday 
in its earnings report for the full business year to the end of September.
 Europe's number-two low-cost airline saw its annual net profit rise by 13 percent to 450 million pounds ($704 
million, 565 million euros), with pre-tax operating earnings even climbing by 22 percent.
 Passenger numbers jumped by 7 percent to 64.8 million as EasyJet picked up business dropped by Air France, 
which had to cancel a large number of fights during a record two-week strike by its pilots.
 Rewarding its shareholders
 "Our performance demonstrates our continued focus on cost and progress against every strategic revenue 
priority," CEO Carolyn McCall said in a statement.
 EasyJet announced an increase in its ordinary dividend per share by 35.5 percent to 45.5 pence.
 The company's main rival in the segment, Ireland's Ryanair, has recently been seen moving into space traditionally 
occupied by EasyJet, improving its customer service and expanding into primary airports used by business 
travelers.

 Analysts recognise the following companies as the key players in the Aviation Market in Europe (airlines and 
airports) are: Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Ryanair Holdings Plc, London Heathrow Airport and Paris Charles de Gaulle 
Airport. Other Prominent Vendors in the market are: Aeroflot, CSA Czech Airlines, LOT - Polish Airlines, Norwegian 
Air Shuttle, Pegasus Airlines, Rossiya - Russian Airlines, S7 Airlines, Transaero Airlines and UTair Aviation
One key trend emerging in this market is the rise of low cost carriers in Europe. This is expected to increase air 
traffic in the region. LCCs provide a relatively economical alternative to air travel for millions of people. They make 
travel more affordable for a larger traveler base and are likely to service many destinations
One of the major drivers in this market is the growth in airline alliances, which offer the advantage of global reach, 
recognition, and seamless service to an international traveler. With the rise in the number of people who travel by 
air, there has been an overall increase in international passenger traffic, resulting in a rise in the number of 
commercial airports and airlines. 
Further, one of the major challenges in the market is the rise in ATF prices. The increase in ATF prices reduces the 
profit margins of commercial airlines, thereby preventing them from upgrading their current aircraft fleets.
Analysts forecast the Aviation market in Europe to grow at a CAGR of 4.21 percent over the period 2013-2018.
Aviation includes airports and airlines; the Aviation market in Europe considers both the Airports and Airlines 
markets in Europe. This market provides details about some of the legacy airlines in the world such as Lufthansa 
and Ryanair and some of the world's busiest airports such as London Heathrow Airport and Paris Charles De 
Gaulle Airport. These airports generate a large amount of revenue from both aeronautical and non-aeronautical 
sources. The Aviation market in Europe facilitates the growth of tourism and trade in this geography.

Ryanair Named Second Worst Brand in the World for Customer Service
From Daily Mail[5]
 By Andrea Magrath (@AndreaMagrath[6])
 Not so long ago, Comcast made headlines with their not-so-likable customer service performance, but do not be 
shocked when you find out that they do not top the list of the worst brand in the customer service space. Not even 
second.
 Ryanair is a European airline famous for their low-cost fares, but the downside to their ridiculous discount is their 
ridiculously bad customer service. Want more bad news? Ryanair only nabbed second place. AXA insurance just 
tops it all off.

Heath Department Employee Suspended for Talking like a ROBOT on Customer Service Hotline
From Daily Mail[10]
 By Alexandra Klausner
 More times than not, we are greeted by a completely automated customer service representative whenever we call 
a certain company. Often, these voices are recorded and stacked within machines and are made to answer 
questions with generic queues. One man tried to disguise himself like one of these automated robots, and it 
backfired.
 The man reportedly did it for five times last 2013 and was recently ordered suspension for 20 working days.

            https://jonathanturley.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/screen-shot-2014-11-07-at-6-50-30-am.pngThrough the 
years, I have written stories criticizing the airline industry for its nosedive in customer services and 
accommodations. (here[1] and here[2] and here[3] and here[4] and here[5] and here[6] and here[7] and here[8] and 
here[9] and here[10] and here[11]). It now turns out that airlines are moving to make flights even more 
uncomfortably with 'bench seating' that will allow them to stuff more passengers into a cabin. While this is better 
than the 'standing only' sections of RyanAir, it is yet another example of how passengers are now being treated as 
little more than bleating sheep by airline executives who have already reduced space so that you cannot open a 
computer or risk knee capping.
The new seats are described in the article below as ''park bench' airline seats that have much thinner padding that 
previous models (they're as hard as sitting on a park bench in other words—although I've likened them to a church 
pew in the past posts). And because they're thinner, the airlines figure they can move rows of them closer together, 
which means more seats per plane.' The seats are also shorter so that you are sitting on a ledge that ends on the 
middle of an average person's thighs. On long flights, it will add to the already growing discomfort on these flying 
cattle cars of coach. With more passengers, there will also be less room overhead and longer lines at bathrooms. 
 The suggestions for travelers, including dividing flights into multiple flights to avoid the pain of sitting in these 
benches for long periods. Thus we now have to spend hours more in flight to deal with punishing conditions on 
airplanes. However, my favorite is 'bring your own seat cushion' which you can bring on with neck pillows like ones 
sold by Tempur-Pedic that is 16 x 16 x 2 inches.
 Of course, there is also the suggestion (clearly preferred by the airlines) to upgrade. First class is now what coach 
used to be and coach is now what baggage holds used to be on American airlines.

How to Fly Budget Airlines and Stay Sane
How to Fly Budget Airlines and Stay Sane
Vagabond Journey

Nov 06, 2014 (Vagabond Journey:http://www.vagabondjourney.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
            http://www.vagabondjourney.com/how-to-fly-budget-airlines-and-stay-sane/ A lack of preparation on the 
passenger's part does not constitute an emergency on the airline's. You should have used the toilet before 
boarding, you should have brought warm enough clothes so you wouldn't need a blanket, you should have carried 
on your own bottle of water and snacks if you thought you were going to get hungry or thirsty. Now you must pay for 
your error of judgement, would that be cash or credit?
 This is said in jest, but there is more truth to it than I'd like to admit. 
 While RyanAir really did once threatened to stock their planes with pay toilets, this is a rather extreme thing for 
even budget airlines to do — but it does show the mentality behind the business model nonetheless. This is a 
mentality that must be passed on to you, dear passenger, if you are to remain sane while taking these cheap flights. 
 There is a certain outlook that is needed to fly on budget airlines. You need to realize that you are going to be 
tricked, scammed, and charged ridiculous fees throughout the entire process. You have to realize that this is just 
normal part of the deal — it's nothing personal. As far as I'm concerned, I love budget airlines. It's not just the 
cheaper prices but the challenge of trying to get that cheapest price possible by decoding the trickery and deception 
and trying to come out as unscathed as possible. Budget air travel is a game: the airline tries to snatch as much 
money from you as they can and you try to keep as much as possible. While the odds, like most games, are always 
in the favor of the house, this doesn't mean that you can't win too. Rest assured, no matter what moves the budget 
airline tries to pull, you are probably going to pay significantly less in the end than if you went with a full-service 
carrier. 
 In theory, budget airlines provide the consumer with a choice. They allow you to chose the services you want 
without being charged for the ones you don't. So you chose if you need a checked-in bag, you chose if you want to 
eat, you chose if you want to have your boarding pass printed at the airport or if you just want to do it yourself in 
advance, etc . . . This is opposed to full-service airlines who don't give you a choice and just charges you for 
everything upfront, whether you want to use it or not. 
 If this is actually how it is on budget airlines there would be no reason to complain: you pay for the optional 
services you want and fend for yourself for the rest. But the truth factor of this marketing angle only goes so far. 
There are two things about budget airlines that everybody hates: 
Item A: Budget airlines profiteer on optional services
To be clear, it doesn't cost an airline anywhere near $5 for someone to borrow a blanket during a flight, it doesn't 
cost $15 for that tray of microwaved pseudo-food, there is no way that a cup of orange juice should be selling for 
How to Fly Budget Airlines and Stay Sane
$5, and charging $3 for some boiled tap water should be a sacrilege. Of course, this isn't the fair market price for 
these things, it's just a tactic for the airline to make back some of the money they lose by offering a dirt cheap base 
fare. 
 Though these exorbitant prices can also be thought of as penalties. The budget airlines charge these prices not 
just because they want to profit from the things sold but because they don't want to offer these goods and services 
to begin with. Each pound on an airplane costs money to fly. To be able to reduce the weight of blankets, meals, 
bottles of water, etc . . . the airlines essentially charge enormous prices. This in turn reduces demand and the need 
to carry as much of any given product on board. So don't think of yourself as being charged for using goods and 
services on a budget airline as being penalized for needing the stuff to begin with. 
Item B: Charging for things that there isn't a choice to buy or not
To put it bluntly, you can't chose whether or not you would like a seat on an airplane. Flying standing passengers is 
surely against the statutes of every aviation related governmental body on the planet. You need a seat, it's not 
optional, so charging passengers for a seat cannot be an extra fee, it must be included in the base price. That's my 
thinking anyway, but it doesn't transfer to some budget airlines who charge an 'extra' fee for the right to sit down on 
a plane. The same goes for checking in, transferring flights, buying tickets (yes, they charge to you to give them 
money), taking breathes from the on-board air supply, etc . . .
 Charging people separate fees for things that are mandatory is simply trickery. It's just a way of artificially providing 
the appearance of a lower base fare while making back the difference later on in the purchasing process. Really, 
these stupid fees are just a part of the base fare distributed differently. Though there is no need getting riled up 
about it, a mandatory charge is a mandatory charge no matter what they call it. 
Scoot Airlines charges US$3.20 for tap water
A cup of this boiled tap water will cost you US$3.20.
 Water isn't a choice that human beings can opt out of. We need it to survive. We get real screwed up if we don't 
drink enough of it — especially when on an airplane for hours that has pressurization system that dehydrate you. 
So I became a little irate when I heard a stewardess for Scoot Airlines inform a passenger that he would need to 
pay $4 Singapore dollars ($3.20) for a cup of warm water — a cup of warm tap water. My adverse reaction was a 
merely a matter of principle — I had ignored Scoot's ban on bringing my own food and drink on the plane, so I had 
enough water to last out the flight. Though the zealot in me wanted to protest the injustice: you cannot deny a 
human a glass of water — this is illegal in some places. So I got out of my seat and went to the rear of the plane to 
have a proverbial pow wow with the stewardesses. 
 I knew that Scoot's 'pay for water' policy had nothing to do with the stewardesses, but they were the enforcers 
nonetheless, so I wanted to hear what they had to say about it. Almost as soon as I arrived in the rear of the plane a 
rather voluptuous stewardess approached me willingly. She seemed almost eager to answer my questions. 
 'So the water that you are serving people, the hot water in the kettle, that's just tap water, right?'
 'Yes.'
 'Do you think it's right to charge people four dollars [SGD] for tap water?'
 'Well,' she answered still wearing a giant smile on her face, 'if you don't want to pay there's a water dispenser 
outside the toilet.'
 'And I can just go up there and get water for free?'
 'Yes, but you have to do it discreetly, because if my CSD knows about it maybe she will get a little . . .' She then 
turn her hands into claws and made a clawing motion around her head. 
 'So you weren't supposed to tell me that?'
 'No, I'm not supposed to tell you,' she responded with a mischievous grin. 
 It was my impression that her CSD was far away, in another part of the plane. 
 I asked her how she deals with people who don't understand the concept of budget airlines and get angry that they 
have to pay extra for everything.
 'Some people are very demanding,' she replied. 'They want the lower fare but they want us to be like a full service 
airline, like Singapore Airlines. But we can't do both. We are more of a local carrier, so what you see is what you 
get. It's totally different. So sometimes there are misunderstandings about it.'
 'So how do you deal with people who get angry at you about this?'
 'Usually I will just walk away. I will explain it to them, but if they don't want to listen I can't force them. I will just walk 
away and that's it.'
 'Do you ever have anyone get really angry and start yelling?'
How to Fly Budget Airlines and Stay Sane
 'YES we do, yes we do!' she said with eyes open wide. 
 I took it that such 'misunderstandings' happen frequently. 
 'I understand that some passengers are unhappy because they can't get what they want,' the stewardess said, 'but 
it's not right to insult the crew. There is only so much that we can give, unlike a full-service airline where everything 
is for free. It's already in your ticket price, that's why it's more expensive.' 
Conclusion
To stay sane riding budget airlines requires an understanding of how they operate, it requires a shifting of 
parameters and a willingness to understand the overarching concept that somehow justify the trickery and the 
ridiculousness. Like the stewardess said, what you see is what you get, budget airlines are totally different from full 
service carriers. So once you get over the dichotomy between fare and fee, they are often one and the same, are 
prepared to put in the time to figure out the convoluted booking systems, and then fend for yourself when onboard, 
budget airlines become much easier to enjoy. 
 I recently flew on Scoot Airlines round trip between Hong Kong and Singapore for a little over a hundred bucks. For 
US$57.50 each way I had no business complaining about the fact that I was charged a mysterious 'airport transfer 
fee' when I didn't even transfer airports, that I had to sneak on my own bottle of water, that there was no in flight 
entertainment system, or that I couldn't afford food or a drink. I flew four hours from one country to another for 
under sixty dollars each way — a fact that I need to appreciate. All that really matters when dealing with budget 
airlines is the bottom line, and no matter what disservices you face, it is all made up for by the price you pay. 
 Getting from point A to point B as cheaply as possible is what it's all about.

move came on solid volume too with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This continues the 
uptrend for the company since Oct 13, as the stock is now up over 26%.
Over the last 30 days, the company witnessed one negative and one positive estimate revision and the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate also moved lower, signaling trouble down the road. So make sure to keep an eye on this stock 
going forward to see if yesterday's move higher lasts.
Ryanair Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while its Earnings ESP[2] is 0.00%.

Nov 03, 2014 (Deutsche Welle Business:http://www.dw-world.de/ Delivered by Newstex)
 Irish low-fare airline Ryanair has raised its annual profit forecast due to a surge in winter bookings and strong 
earnings so far this year. It also wants to lower fares to steal more market share from struggling rivals. Ryanair 
announced Monday that it was expecting almost 20 percent higher profits than originally forecast for its fiscal year 
ending March, with net profit estimated to come in at between 750 million euros ($937 million) and 770 million 
euros.
 The improved guidance came after Europe's largest budget airline reported a rise in profit after tax to 795 million 
euros in the six months to September, the first half of Ryanair's financial year. The figure was up 32 percent over 
the same period last year. Sales advanced nine percent to 3.5 billion euros.
 "We've had a bumper half year and we've had to boost our guidance as we got visibility on the second half of the 
year," said Chief Executive Michael O'Leary.
 O'Leary attributed the rise partly to a series of customer service improvements, including ticket change flexibility, 
greater baggage allowance, priority boarding and premium seats. This had led to 4 percent higher traffic, he said, 
and 2 million more tickets sold than planned for the upcoming winter period.
 "We are keeping prices low while improving the service, it's as simple as that," O'Leary said, adding that Ryanair 
was planning to boost its market share by cutting fares by up to 5 percent until December and a further 10 percent 
in the first three months of 2015.
 By contrast, Ryanair's higher-cost rivals Lufthansa and Air France-KLM have both lowered their profit forecasts for 
this year blaming tough competition and the costs of recent industrial action.

 Stocks finished mixed Monday, deflating after a mild rally. Volume was lighter than Friday's hectic pace on both 
exchanges.
 The Nasdaq ended with a 0.2% gain; the Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.1% and the SP 500 was 
fractionally lower. The Dow was depressed by oil giants Chevron (NYSE:CVX[1]), down nearly 3%, and Exxon 
Mobil (NYSE:XOM[2]), off more than 1% in the stock market today           http://www.investors.com/stock-market-
today/. West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell more than 2% to just over $78 a barrel.
 A major beneficiary of falling oil prices are airlines, one of the best-performing industries Monday. The 
Transportation-Airline group rose 1.4%. Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY[3]) reported earnings that were 10% higher than 
a year ago. The stock gapped up and finished up 6%. Hawaiian Airlines (NASDAQ:HA[4]) rose 4% to an all-time 
high. Spirit Airlines (NASDAQ:SAVE[5]) and United Continental (NYSE:UAL[6]) rose at least 2% each, also making 
new highs.
 IBD 50 stocks were evenly split, with 25 up and 25 down. The best performer was Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA[7]), 
which makes chips for digital cameras, including those used in the Hero series from GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO[8]). 
Ambarella rose 7%. GoPro, which reported earnings Thursday, was up more than 9%.
 The worst performer was Chinese automobile website Autohome (NYSE:ATHM[9]), which reports earnings before 
the open Wednesday. It fell 4% in light trade. Analysts are predicting EPS of 26 cents a share, a 189% increase 
from a year earlier. Autohome has carved out a cup base.
 Contract research organization Quintiles Transnational (NYSE:Q[10]) gained 2% and broke out of a flat base 
Monday in volume more than double the average. It was the second straight gain for the stock after reporting 
earnings Thursday.
 LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD[11]) rose nearly 2% and broke out of a large cup-with-handle base. It has also been rising 
since reporting earnings last Thursday.

 Our biggest stories of the past week are ...
 Ryanair Bank or Private Bank? Your choice![1]
 I've talked for some time about component based banking[2] but what about component based pricing? Bank 
pricing is the most opaque part of the industry, and the part that irritates customers the most. Customers get 
charged high fees for unauthorised overdrafts as this funds free bank services for those who don't go overdrawn. 
Banks focus upon packaged accounts and cross-sell because the core deposit account is their loss leader. It is this 
area of banking that should undergo the most fundamental change over the next years and it is already happening.
 Africa shows the way to the future[3]
 I spent some time reviewing the latest news on M-PESA yesterday. M-PESA is now seven years old, and has 
transformed the African landscape. Since its launch in 2007, over 18 million of the 43 million people who live in 
Kenya have opened an M-PESA account and access to the mobile network operator is 40 times easier than 
accessing a bank (there are 40 M-PESA agents for every bank branch).
 Banking is going through a sea change ... can the tanker turn around?[4]
 I noted the disconnect between the bank community and the technology community some time ago in my Red Pill 
moment[5], and as the year passes it becomes more and more obvious to me that we are going through a sea 
change in finance. Almost every day, I encounter a new start-up who wants to change some part of the banking 
system.
 What is Money?[6]
 Blimey!!! When you start debating nuances of things with the Bitcoin community, it doesn't 'arf get into a pedants 
dream. In this case, we clarified some of the dialogue about the blockchain and bitcoin yesterday. The net:net of 
that discussion is that you have to a have a native currency to use the blockchain. It doesn't have to be bitcoin, but 
as that's the one with five years of development, why would you use another one? This then moved into a 
discussion of money, and what is money.
 Banks using the bitcoin blockchain is like putting a bird in a cage[7]
 The Bitcoin community have been educating me lately in how their currency cannot be regulated. This stems 
from my assertion[8] that money was created to control people and therefore you cannot have money without 
government. The Bitcoin guys tell me that once you've converted your currency into bitcoins, then you can trade 
that currency anywhere globally without government control. Once it's on the blockchain, the money becomes

anonymous. So has government, the system and control failed? Can you have an internet system trading 
commercially without control?
 The major general news stories of the past week include ... 
 - The Telegraph The latest wrong-headed proposal will be announced by the Bank of England on Friday - The 
Independent A property company controlled by one of Saudi Arabia's richest men, Sheikh Mohamed bin Issa al 
Jaber, is suing Barclays for $10bn (£6bn). - The Telegraph National Australia Bank looking at options for UK banks, 
including floating them on the stock market Tesco ATM promises 'free erections'[9] - BBC There's been a rather 
unfortunate translation error on an ATM outside an Aberystwyth store. - The Independent Guy Fawkes, 2010. It 
may not mean much to most people - 5 November comes round every year, after all. But at the top of Standard 
Chartered, among the bank's hierarchy, and for its investors, the date is etched in the memory. Apple CEO fires 
back as retailers block Pay[10] - Reuters LAGUNA BEACH Calif. (Reuters) - Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook fired back at 
CVS and Rite Aid on Monday after the drugstore chains blocked the iPhone maker's mobile payments service, 
saying there were plenty of other retailers around the world to sign up. - The Telegraph Banks need to hire the right 
people to help them with a change in customer needs and technology, but regulators are standing in the way

Wow Air Offers Low Cost Transatlantic Flights To Europe
Wow Air Offers Low Cost Transatlantic Flights To Europe

Nov 02, 2014 (I4U News:http://www.i4u.com Delivered by Newstex)
 Flights to Europe just became more affordable for American passengers in 2015. Wow Air, a discount air carrier 
out of of Iceland, is promising afford fares from Baltimore Washington International Airport and Boston to Reykjavik 
(Iceland), Copenhagen (Denmark), and London (England). Washington Post's Roberto A. Ferdman reports some of 
the fares will cost as little as $99 USD for a round-trip ticket. Phenomenally priced, the airline promised the slashed 
cost would only run in a limited capacity. 
Skuli Mogensen, Wow Air's chief executive, pointed out that "those are definitely opening, introductory fares." While 
the company looks to offer the cheapest ticket prices for every round trip, prices will heavily depend on season, fuel 
prices, and flight vacancies. "On an occasional basis we hope to be able to introduce similar fares, but those very 
aggressive. We wouldn't be talking if I had introduced prices more commonly seen in the market, would we?" A 
quick search between Boston and Reykjavik showed a $503.81 round trip ticket between May 24 and June 4, 2015. 
Even Priceline's discounted Icelandair tickets begins at $673.60. According to bestfares.com's CEO Tom Parsons, 
"Paying even $200 for a one-way flight to, say, London, is unheard of." He said, "It just doesn't exist." Parsons 
believes the round trip prices between Boston and Reykjavik are typically around $600 for a March 2015 trip. 
Anyone who has recently looked at travel prices between American and European hubs will agree. A one-way ticket 
between Atlanta and Frankfurt, Germany, can cost around $2300. However, the limitation on locations will make the 
deals very difficult for many people not located in the metropolitan areas.

 So how can Wow Air offer such amazing prices?The devil is in the details, of course. Ferdman notes that a trip "will 
come with little more than a seat, mini-tray table, and 11 pound carry-on." In fact, the price of luggage may cause 
some pause. "A carry-on will cost an extra $29 when booked online, or an additional $48 when done so at the 
airport." And if you plan on checking luggage, put more cash aside since each piece is $48 (online) or $67 (counter 
check-in). If a traveler is looking for extra leg room, a pre-assigned seat, food, or any other sort of creature comfort, 
then expect to raise the price. However, Wow Air's director of communications, Svanhvít Fridriksdóttir, said the 
space between seats will be between 30 and 36 inches on an Airbus A320. That's more room than competition 
Spirit Airlines offers at only 28 inches, which is even lower than the industry standard of 31 inches. The airline 
hopes efficient operations, online marketing and sales, and reliable but limited airplanes will keep prices down. 
Mogensen believes "we have extremely good aircraft utilization." And the airline plans to frequently test the theory 
Wow Air Offers Low Cost Transatlantic Flights To Europe
out. "Within one 24-hour cycle, a single airplane will fly from Iceland to Boston, back to Iceland, and continue to 
London, and then back to Iceland, each time full of passengers." While the company is positive on the future, 
industry critics do not see the sustainability long term. The 5.5 hour flight between Boston and Reykjavik may put 
customers off, as well as the potentially disastrous result if off-schedule. With limited aircrafts, a late flight will have 
a deeper ripple effect than a larger service that can reroute passengers on other incoming flights.

 However, Bob Mann, an aviation industry analyst at R.W. Mann and Co. Consulting, feels one advantage is the 
fact the airlines is based in Iceland, giving a midway point to refuel between the last leg of flight. "As you go shorter 
and shorter distances, you can ferry less fuel, and save money." Mogensen agreed with Mann about the easy of 
hub location. "The long haul low cost model hasn't really been implemented because it's hard to achieve the 
utilization needed. That is, unless you have a hub in the middle. And Iceland is perfectly suited.' Mann carefully 
points out that popular Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair has considered transatlantic flights for years, but never quite 
made the final leap. "If anybody was going to do it, and anybody had the greatest potential to succeed, it would be 
them. And yet they've decided it's not in the cards. That's a cautionary tale, I'd said." Wow Air is still optimistic and 
looking at the long picture. The company hopes to expand to at least four more American destination and to be 
flying a total of ten airplanes by 2016. Given the booked dates already, Wow Air seems to be onto something. "If 
you think you can make it Europe with an 11 pound bag, Wow Air offers a fantastic deal," Parsons definitely see the 
potential in the discount carrier, which will be useful for students, tourists, and business people alike. "Even with 
their extras, you would still end up flying for a lot cheaper than with other carriers.

When I go to an oversaes ATM, I see the fees being charged ofr currency excahgne and ATM usage, and know 
exactly what percentage the bank is taking for the pleasure of getting money out of their machine.
 Similary, in a business account, I get a break down of all charges for processing cheques and electronic transfers.
 When I make an international payment, I can see the fees charged for the international transfer, exchange rates 
and more.
 Unforutnalty, I don't get that break down when I make a payment through PayPal (who in my view sneak a lot of 
cost itno the process) or in my deposit account.
 That will change.
 As we move to compnonet based banking, component based procing will become a new battleground.
 50 cents per $100 for my depsoti account?
 0.5% fee for trasnfers?
 Overdrawn? Costs are $1 a day plus $1 for every transfer in and out of the account.
 All of this will become obvious and clear.
 In fact, as I stumbled across this the other day, it will become like Ryanair or SouthWest Airlines in banking. This is 
an idea sparked by John Egan's ebook on the future of banking[2]:
 RYANAIR - THE LOW COST BANK 
 A bank that doesn't charge for banking. 
 Core to Ryanair's business model is their reluctance to charge any sort of signiﬁcant margin on their core function, 
i.e. flying people places. Instead, Ryanair actually separates their core business from their core revenues. 
Customers don't pay for ﬂights, they pay for comfort and customisation. 
 The Ryanair bank works the same way. You the customer don't get charged a margin on ﬁnancial products. You 
get them at cost, ensuring that Ryanair are consistently the lowest cost provider in the market. If you want a loan, a 
Ryanair Bank or Private Bank? Your choice!
credit card, a savings account or an overdraft, you ﬁll out all the forms yourself online and any mistakes suffer a 
monetary penalty. You also pay a fee to be provided with an ATM or laser card, another fee for access to ATM's in 
different countries than where you opened the account, another fee for transferring money to other accounts etc. 
There are no branches and if you want to talk to customer support you have to call a premium rate phone line. 
 The online component of Ryanair's bank is besieged by advertisements and optional extras. Trying to pay bills 
online will have you greeted by banners asking if you want to buy insurance? Or a pension? Or investments? Or an 
umbrella? Of course, being a customer of Ryanair's low cost bank entitles you to privileged access to ﬂight sales, 
instant priority boarding, a bottle of water when you take your seat and maybe even discounts on in-ﬂight 
merchandise. 
 Ryanair is belligerently honest about what it offers passengers. It does exactly what it says on the tin. Flights may 
be cheap but Ryanair have the youngest ﬂeet of planes in Europe. It may drop you in a ﬁeld 100 miles from where 
you want to go, but they told you that before you booked and they got you there safely. 
 Ryanair's bank is the same; you will not be treated to a high standard of luxury or customer service. You will not 
get frequent correspondence in the post, they will not help you in renegotiating payments but if all you want is 
somewhere to put your money safely, then this is your bank. 
 Sounds like a bloody nightmare to me, so I would naturally abscond to the private bank.
 PRIVATE BANK - THE PERFECT PLACE FOR YOUR PRIVATES
 A bank that charges you the earth to give you heaven.
 Private Bank is the bank for those who know that wealth is when you don't have to worry about fees. As you walk 
into Private Bank, and of course you do visit our branches because it is your Private Club, you find our masseuse 
and cocktail waiters at hand.
 Meeting with your bank manager is more like meeting with your mentor. Your manager is your friend and sage, and 
you can talk about anything with them from your money to your relationships. Some of our clients use our services 
as psychotherapy, others as hypnotherapy and others for sexual therapy. We don't care, as we can service all of 
your deepest desires and needs.
 All of this for a membership fee of $12,000 per year, along with our rack rate of fees for each service:
 $50 for hypnotherapy $100 for psychotherapy $1,000 for sexual therapy
 Some come and join the Private Bank today … the perfect place for your privates.
 If you think this is way off the mark, here's the concept presentation outlines for just such a private bank I 
encountered a few years ago.

 Beverly Hills, CA, October 30, 2014 --(PR.com[1])-- A few decades ago when Americans thought of Texas they 
probably thought of a few things such as: Go Big, JR Ewing and Oil and Gas. Today it seems like things haven't 
changed much.
Recently in the headlines, Wilbur Ross reported by Forbes magazine to be one of American's billionaires worth 2.9 
billion has taken another significant position in the banking, oil and gas industry. One of his more well known 
investments has been with the Bank of Ireland where he made a profit of 500 million euros on a 290 million euro 
investment in less than 3 years as reported in Reuters. According to Nasdaq, Wilbur Ross holds over a 60% stake 
in another Texan oil company EXCO. His most recent undertaking has been to take significant part of the Bank of 
Cyprus and it's billion-euro share sale which he has now raised over 400 million Euros. Bank of Cyprus is the 
largest bank in Cyprus as reported in the Cyprus Mail newspaper.
Why would this Billionaire investor take such an enormous fiscal banking interest in an island in the Mediterranean 
especially after the major banking crisis, crash and bailout as shown on the World News in March 2013?
It's simple…. Gas and Oil.
Enter center stage Noble Energy an American Texas based drilling company who announced in 2011 a discovery 
of natural gas yielding up to an average of between 5-8 trillion tcf off the shores of Cyprus as reported in StratRisks 
in July 2013. Noble Energy is also talking shop with the Cypriot government over a potential deal for an on shore 
liquefied natural gas (LNG). Cyprus will be set to be the major hub of the hydrocarbon market and natural gas 
distribution for all the EU nations, Middle East and Israel. In fact, Haliburton and Schlumburger two of the world's 
largest oilfield service companies have chosen Cyprus as their base of operations for the eastern Mediterranean 
according to the May, 2014 Cyprus Mail article. Haliburton is estimating 50-60 new wells to be drilled in the next few 
years states gas expert Charles Ellinas former executive chairman of Cyprus Natural Hydrocarbons Company.
So why does Mr. Ross make a significant financial stake in the biggest bank in Cyprus? Well, to the layperson it's 
pretty obvious why. Yet in the first of his two-part interview with a local Cypriot newspaper the daily Phileleftheros, 
Mr. Ross said that tourism business which has been underrated, financial services and natural resources 
(hydrocarbon) can drive the economy forward. This is especially due to the planned privatization of the ports as a 
Real Estate Investors Following the Gas and Oil
condition of the island's bailout agreement. Not to mention the Super Casino recently fast tracked to be licensed in 
2015 by the Cypriot Government that would include malls, restaurants, theme park, entertainment and residential 
buildings that would rival Las Vegas. Ross was told by Ryanair that they could bring up to 2.5 million tourists a year 
as quoted by the Cyprus Mail.
Back in America, according to Neil Irwin of the New York Times says that "the American housing market seems to 
be stalling the economy and except for a few booming markets, housing is nowhere close to pulling its economic 
weight for the national economy.' Micheal Fiscina owner and CEO of Realty Group International Inc located in 
Beverly Hills, California rgico.com[2] says 'Many of the buying opportunities from the US crash in 2008 have been 
taken. Not as many deals to be had in 2014 due to less short sales, foreclosures and higher market rate sales. We 
see many homeowners are taking advantage of the possible temporary housing bubble and getting out when the 
market is high or peaked. Also we are finding that these sellers and investors are not necessarily re-investing. The 
common reason is because they are waiting for the market to downgrade again before they re-purchase. Sell high 
and buy low seems to be the predominant theme. But in many Southern Californian neighborhoods the demand is 
more than the supply.' Mr. Fiscina who is a licensed Real Estate Broker in multiple states also explains 'This is why 
Real Estate investors are looking abroad for more buying opportunities with a better return on their investments.'
'Realty Group International has been doing business oversees since its inception. And in the early 2000's we added 
satellite offices in London, Paris, Rome, Barcelona, Rio De Janeiro and now Cyprus. Recently RGI was able to 
acquire a one on one alliance with the largest most well known and respected Real Estate Company in Cyprus with 
over 3000 properties for sale which his group has currently contracted directly with them. We are the first American 
realty company to show a substantial presence in Cyprus,' stated Michael Fiscina, rgicyprus.com[3]. To date the 
Real Estate market has consisted of primarily the Russian, European, Chinese, Israeli, and Arab countries Real 
Estate market investors as noted in the Business Insider article on The Sweet Mega Marina for the International 
Oligarchs.
'Since Americans are now intrinsically involved in the natural gas and oil drilling and production we feel it's 
important to have an American influence to provide our US citizens and companies a high level of consumer 
confidence to be able to comfortably purchase. For this reason RGI has brought on board American resident and 
native Cypriot, Hratch (James) Chaderjian as a consultant who was formally employed with the UN for over 10 
years for a more personalized approach to the unfamiliar investor. Yes, He is even considered our tour guide when 
needed,' said Rachelle Schreiber RGI's Executive Regional Manager. Rachelle who also has a license in Real 
Estate with the BRE for over 25 years also states that "RGI is currently working with several Fortune 500 
Companies that are showing great financial interest in the Cyprus real estate and business marketplace.'
'With the recent visit by US Vice-President Biden we figured it was necessary that the US investor be educated 
towards the fiscal developments and investment opportunities and in turn put Cyprus on the map for not only 
American but potential international investors,' stated Mr. Chaderjian. 'In addition with the discovery of natural gas 
and American alliance now forged for this endeavor it is only a matter of time until the economic market and real 
estate industry skyrockets. Along with the hydrocarbon industry the tourism sector is being greatly highlighted due 
to its state of the art developments such as the marinas, golf courses, commercial buildings, multi-family and single 
family residences. The super casino will be a big deal in this region because there is nowhere else like this except 
for Monte Carlo and will dwarf it in comparison and be something the EU and the Middle East cannot experience 
anywhere else except for in Las Vegas, Nevada,' according to Mr. Chaderjian.
It is important to highlight the new opportunity for Residency and Citizenship through real estate investment now 
found on the Cyprus Immigration website. Many clients are not aware that with the purchase of property totaling EU 
300,000 will allow one to obtain a permanent residency
rgicyprus.com/investment-and-eu-residency/[4], this would allow anyone to freely travel to the EU. And for a EU 3 
Million investment in real estate or bank deposits, this would entitle one to acquire a Cypriot EU passport and direct 
citizenship.
Real Estate Investors Following the Gas and Oil
The potential for Cypriot growth is undeniable and unstoppable. And as for savvy Americans like Wilbur Ross and 
Haliburton, many investors tend to go where the oil and gas is found. So like the JR Ewing's character in Dallas, 
educated investors are pushing, grabbing, running not walking to this part of the Mediterranean while the 
opportunities are still hot and are not scooped up by fierce competitors. And yes, America does know who its 
competitors are. So watch out world because here come the Americans… once again.

Case of the Day: In re Application of Ryanair
Case of the Day: In re Application of Ryanair

 The case of the day is In re Request for Subpoena by Ryanair Ltd. (N.D. Cal. 2014)[1]. Ryanair had sued Joachim 
Kleinert in Dublin, alleging that he was liable for publishing a false report about its safety and maintenance record. 
Kleinert failed to appear, and the Irish court entered a default judgment. Ryanair then applied for leave under § 
1782 to serve subpoenas on Google and Twitter; Kleinert apparently had a Gmail account and a Twitter account, so 
Ryanair believed the two companies might have information about his whereabouts for purposes of enforcing the 
Irish judgment.
The application was mostly routine, and the judge granted it as a matter of course. But the judge (Magistrate Judge 
Paul Grewal, who has featured in many cases of the day and who no doubt has one of the best judicial perches in 
the land for handling § 1782 cases) passed over what to me was potentially the most interesting point in the case. 
The statute requires that the evidence sought be for use in a foreign proceeding. The judge held that 'enforcement 
of a judgment issued by the Dublin Circuit Court' is 'undisputedly' a foreign proceeding. This is potentially 
problematic. There was some suggestion in the record[2] that Ryanair thought Kleinert lived in Germany, not in 
Ireland, and there is no discussion about whether it would be necessary to bring a proceeding in Germany to 
enforce the Irish judgment there. And in any case, since Ryanair didn't really know where Kleinert was, maybe he 
was not in Germany at all—maybe he was in the United States, in which case proceedings to enforce the judgment 
would not be foreign proceedings at all. 
 Suppose the case were purely domestic: a Massachusetts judgment with a judgment debtor residing in the District 
of Massachusetts. In that case, there would be no necessity for a 'proceeding' to enforce the judgment, it seems to 
me; you just put the writ of execution in the hands of the marshal. (Of course, the judgment creditor could bring 
proceedings to enforce the judgment). Or suppose a Massachusetts judgment with a judgment debtor residing in 
another state. Because federal judgments can be registered in any district without bringing an action on the 
judgment, it seems to me, again, that there would be no necessity for a 'proceeding' to enforce the judgment. You 
may object that I'm talking about US procedures when it seems likely that Kleinert is in Europe. But the EU, in light 
of the recast of the Brussels I regulation, is moving towards abolition of the exequatur[3].
 So in short, I wonder whether, in cases where the applicant seeks information about a judgment debtor's 
whereabouts for purposes of enforcing a foreign judgment, the issues are as simple as they may seem.

 Guey in Nueva Andalucia or Suite on Marbella's famous Golden Mile waterfront both offer fine cuisine and a place 
to dance the night away. Other top venues are The Playwright, El Jardin, and Sunset Marbella.
 Southern Spain has warm sunny days and nights all year round making it an attractive choice for beach and 
nightlife. Expect to spend more money in the summer but budget airlines like Norwegian and Ryanair fly to Malaga

Marbella is a perfect choice.

 Berlin's constant energy and amazing choice of clubs and bars makes it number one on our list. With a casual

anywhere.
 The German capital has everything; from abandoned warehouses to smaller unique venues, there's a long list of 
favourite dance destinations for anyone.
 All the rage right now are Club der Visonaere, Berghain, Watergate, Picknick, Trust and Tresor.

 The three most popular parts of the city for clubbing are Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg and Friedrichshain. Like Barcelona, 
Berlin doesn't get going until at least 1am.
 Being the capital of Germany there is no shortage of both regular and budget airlines that reach Berlin on a daily

 Trains and buses arrive here from all over Europe on any day of the week. Hotels are available for every budget so 
check on-line for the best deals.
 These are our 5 best club destinations in Europe, but these are by no means the only clubs in Europe. Europe has 
many other great clubs catering for different tastes, budgets and styles.
 It's a case of you booking a flight, put on your dancing shoes and getting out there to see what's the best clubs in 
Europe for you!

 France retained its position as the world's leading tourism destination in 2013, in terms of tourist volume. The 
country received 86.1 million international visitors that year, an increase of 3.7% over 2012. In terms of expenditure, 
however, the sector declined in 2013 due to the uncertainties in Europe's economic environment, as it is the region 
from where the country attracts its largest number of tourists.
Key Highlights
• Tourism plays a key role in the French economy, and the country is a famous tourist destination globally. The 
sector contributed EUR192.3 billion (US$254.9 billion) to the economy in 2013, representing 9.3% of GDP. In the 
same year, tourism output totaled EUR472.7 billion (EUR626.6 billion), and increased at a compound annual 
growth rate (CAGR) of 1.16% during the review period (2009-2013). • In terms of the number of trips and terms of 
expenditure, in which the country was the third largest, the French domestic tourism market is the largest within 
Europe. The total number of domestic trips increased marginally, going from 202.8 million in 2009 to 203.2 million in 
2013, at a review-period CAGR of 0.04%, and managed to exceed the pre-crisis level in 2013. • International 
arrivals to the country grew from 76.8 million in 2009 to 86.1 million in 2013, at a review-period CAGR of 2.91%, 
while inbound tourist expenditure increased at a marginal CAGR of 0.26%, going from EUR90.7 billion (US$126.0 
billion) in 2009 to EUR91.7 billion (US$121.5 billion) in 2013. • The French tourism board Atout France introduced a 
new campaign in 2013 called 'More to Enjoy'. This covered the UK, one of the most important source markets for its 
inbound tourism. The campaign brought together 37 tourist boards, 8 tour operators, 2 carriers and TV5 monde (a 
French TV Channel) in order to promote experiences in France. • Air France, the leading French carrier, has 
struggled to compete with European counterparts such as Ryanair and easyJet. In the wake of intense completion 
from LCCs, the company revealed plans to shift more flights to its discount carrier Transavia in 2014. • Paris is at 
the centre of the French hotel market, and benefits from a continuous increase in the average daily rate (ADR) and 
high occupancy. The occupancy rate in the capital increased from 78.4% in 2012 to 81.0% in 2013, the second-
highest in Europe after London. • The French government revealed a series of initiatives during the National 
Conference on Tourism 2014, in which intends to set a flat price for taxis moving between Charles de Gaulle 
(Roissy) Airport and Paris from January 1, 2015. Furthermore, a taxi and bus lane on the A1 motorway will also be 
opened in January 2015. These measures are expected to drive car rental market towards growth over the forecast 
period. • Increasing internet penetration resulted in the strong growth of online travel bookings during the review 
period. According to the World Bank statistics, the French internet penetration rate increased from 71.6% in 2009 to 
81.9% in 2013. Consequently, the adoption of online bookings channel is growing, and is being increasingly used 
for sale of various travel intermediaries products.

Oct 07, 2014 (The Financial Services Club Blog:http://www.thefinanser.com Delivered by Newstex)
 I had a realisation over the past two weeks of conferences. Having attended Finovate, SIBOS, Innotribe, a 
Financial Services Club meeting on cryptocurrencies and several dinners with bankers, we are at an impasse.
 It's the meeting of two tribes, and the tribes do not mix well.
 One tribe is full of suits, fine wines, Michelin-star restaurants and business class jets. The other is all jeans, beer, 
pizza and Ryanair. It's not necessarily quite as extreme as this, but it's not far off.
 I guess the first time this occurred to me was in dialogue about Silicon Valley versus Wall Street[1].
 It struck me again when I attended Finovate[2] last month. It was specifically highlighted there when Yodlee[3] 
presented their API developments, with a guy dressed in half-suit and half-jeans/t-shirt. It was a parody, but one 
that worked with the developer half of the presenter shouting: 'hey man, you need an API', and the banker half 
responding: 'what the hell are you talking about?'
 I encounter exactly such reactions on regular occasions - in one recent Board meeting, the Marketing Director 
looked aghast and said 'I didn't realise this was going to be a technical meeting' - even though I try to translate what 
these things mean as I go along.
 It's weird in fact that, twenty years ago, I predicted that banks would have technologists on the Board. Today, 
banks are technology companies[4].
 Finance and technology has created this hybrid market called fintech, and this market is populated by both breeds 
of human. That was clearly illustrated, and has been for several years, by the innotribe at SIBOS. 
 Innotribe sits in its own place in the bank show. By that, I mean 'in its own place'. It's often tucked away where only 
the need-to-know will find it. When they do find it, they enter a room of half-bankers and half-technologists and 
innovators. 
 
 It's a room that mixes uneasily, as demonstrated last week when I asked: 'who here understands 
cryptocurrencies[5]', and none of the suits raised their hands.
 Talking of cryptocurrencies, it was illustrated once more last night when the Financial Services Club held a meeting 
dedicated to cryptocurrencies at the London Escalator[6], a space owned by Barclays.

Suits or jeans, canapés or pizzas? The fintech shuffle moves on ...
 Several of our suits in the audience felt uneasy that they had to come to East London: 'isn't this part of London a bit 
dangerous', they asked. It may well be for a middle-aged man in a suit. The fintech guys were fine however. 
Generally millennials in jeans, they happily relaxed in the Escalator space.
 Perhaps it was best illustrated however, by our refreshments. The Financial Services Club normally meets in old 
Livery halls that date back to the 15th Century, with suited waiters offering us wine and canapés. At the Escalator, 
there were no waiters and the food was pizza, burgers and beers.
            http://thefinanser.co.uk/.a/6a01053620481c970b01b8d078b198970c-popup
 If I'm honest, I'm happy in both communities. We are all human, after all (or are we dancers?).

Lufthansa pilots ground long-haul flights

 Passengers seeking to fly with Lufthansa may face major disruptions as the German airline's pilots have resumed 
industrial action. Their fifth walkout this year is primarily affecting Frankfurt Airport. German flagship carrier 
Lufthansa said Tuesday that despite the renewed strike over its pilots' early retirement scheme it would provide 32 
out of 57 long-haul flights from Frankfurt.
 The strike started at 0600 GMT and is scheduled to continue until 2100 GMT, but its knock-on effects meant that 
flights via Frankfurt, Europe's third largest airport, could be disrupted until early on Wednesday.
 The strike followed inconclusive talks over the terms of a retirement scheme between the VC pilots' union and the 
management of Lufthansa last week, which were broken off on Thursday.
 "Since management is still failing to come up with an offer for a compromise we see ourselves forced to resort to 
this measure," VC said in a statement. 
 The 5,400 pilots employed at Lufthansa, its budget subsidiary Germanwings, and Lufthansa Cargo demand that 
the airline should keep an existing retirement benefit scheme that allows pilots to retire at the age of 55.
 Perks for pilots
 The pilots are fighting a plan by Lufthansa management to raise the minimum retirement age, and to involve pilots 
in the financing of their pensions.
 Lufthansa pilots have already staged industrial action four times this year, idling a total of 4,300 flights that left 
480,000 passengers stranded.
 After the new talks collapsed on Thursday, Lufthansa insisted that it had "signaled its willingness to compromise" 
and offered to talk about the contentious points.
 Like other European carriers, Lufthansa is battling to reduce costs in the face of stiff competition from budget 
airlines such as EasyJet and Ryanair.

Air France Cancels More Flights As Strike Stretches On

 Air France has hit more turbulence.
The longest strike in the French national carrier's history grounded 55 percent of flights scheduled for Sunday as 
negotiations collapsed[1] after the government and the airline on Saturday rejected a request from the pilots' union 
for a mediator. 
'Air France regrets this situation and is making every effort to minimize the inconvenience this strike action may 
cause to its customers,' the company said in a statement[2] Saturday.
More than half of Air France's pilots were expected to be on strike on Sunday. The strike is costing parent company 
Air France-KLM about $25 million a day.
Pilots began picketing 13 days ago against the carrier's plan to beef up its budget airline Transavia in hopes of 
wooing cost-conscious travelers away from rivals Ryanair and easyJet. Both competitors are expanding in Paris. 
Under a 2007 bargaining agreement, the pilots can control how many planes Transavia can operate from France. 
They refuse to lift the cap unless the airline begins paying all salaried cockpit crews the same pay and benefits 
given to Air France pilots.
Salaries for Air France pilots start at about $100,000 -- and can more than triple throughout a pilot's career, 
according to the Wall Street Journal[3]. The airline also pays for its pilots to eat at gourmet eateries in Paris airports.
The company said it has sent out 3.2 million texts and messages to alert customers about flight cancellations.
Still, travelers posted about the inconvenience on Twitter: 
So we were supposed to fly air France tomorrow but air France is on strike and our flight got canceled wow —

Well now here's some of the usual marketing double talk that just goes to show we really haven't progressed very 
far past the days when we all lived in caves. VietJet Air, which hired a bunch of bikini-clad models from modeling 
agency Venus for a photoshoot, is now denying the photos are official.
A spokesperson said the "uncensored" photos were "leaked from a test shooting under a contract between VietJet 
Air and Venus and are not the official promotional photos of VietJet Air."
Which begs the question, why did VietAir hire the models for the photoshoot in the first place? Just for fun? Right. 
No. They've done it before[1]. It's there thing. And now that everyone's upset, they're just denying the whole thing. 
And come one, in this day and age when everyone has a phone and Instagram, there ain't no secrets anymore. 
Many of the models posted pictures from the shoot which occurred last week and now the airline is trying to clean 
up the mess. Good luck with that. 
The airline went on to stick its foot further in its mouth saying,"We are sorry for the incident and are enacting 
necessary measures to prevent these ugly and unofficial photos from spreading."
Here are some photos from the shoot:

kxY7YsfQ0JQ/VB7jbmCumHI/AAAAAAAAJH8/WPrvKhutDIM/s1600/Lufthansa1stClass1950s.jpgMy grandparents 
belonged to a generation when there was still novelty and romance associated with commercial flight. They would 
dress in their finest as they jetted off to American or European capitals for work or leisure. "Put on your finest suit, 
dear; we're flying to Vienna tonight." I am sure this memory was not something I made up[1]: until the early 
Seventies, it really was like this[2]. Since air travel was oh so very costly. you might as well live it up while airborne. 
For better or worse, deregulation and the accompanying democratization of flight has made air travel mundane. So 
much so that the shirtless, lardy American bloke you would rather avoid[3] in public ends up next to you on the 
plane...snoring rather loudly...drooling on your shoulder. Yuck. 
For many a flag carrier, glamour and now passenger civility are not the only things which have been jettisoned. 
Profitability is another thing as national carriers have found it hard to deal with legacy costs, unprofitable routes, and 
competition from low-cost carriers. Ask Malaysia Airlines[4]. All things considered, things are even worse[5] for 
European carriers that now find the most unprofitable routes to be those at home: The biggest airlines across 
Europe are finding it tricky to make money in their own backyards. Air France-KLM said on Thursday it will transfer 
a major portion of its European flights to Transavia, a low-cost airline acquired by KLM 11 years ago, as part of a 
major restructuring aimed at reversing losses on short flights. The same strategy has been adopted in Germany 
with Lufthansa's steady shift[6] since 2012 of its European flying from Frankfurt and Munich to its lower-cost 
Germanwings unit. The shunning of European routes by the global flag carriers reflects the cutthroat nature of fare 
competition in the continent, where airlines such as EasyJet, Ryanair, and Wizz Air dominate the short-flight 
market. Those carriers' labor costs are substantially lower than at Lufthansa, Air France, and British Airways, which 
also have routes that don't touch their hubs. Flying routes off their hubs offers very little revenue upside, says Seth 
Kaplan, managing partner of industry journal Airline Weekly, and this is one reason U.S. airlines have virtually 
eliminated flights that don't involve one of their hubs. 'Non-hub, short-haul flying is all a cost game, and that's a 
game the true low-cost carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet will always win,' Kaplan says.It appears unionized workers 
are still hanging on to a bygone age when cutthroat competition did not exist: These flight-shifting and cost-cutting 
tactics have infuriated airline employees in Europe, with three pilot strikes against Lufthansa in the past two weeks. 
Air France, meanwhile, is now bracing for a weeklong pilot strike tentatively set to start on Sept. 15; the airline has 
urged customers to reschedule their trips[7]. Air France-KLM pilots contend that Transavia cockpit crews should be 
paid the same as their peers across the company. All I can say to these unionist-dreamers is this: Wake up, those 
Lose Money Quick Scheme: EU Airlines in, Er, Europe
days are gone and they will never come back. Ours is such an unglamorous age in so many ways. I am of two 
minds about this. Sure you can go to all sorts of places for much lower fares nowadays, but getting there is now 
such a chore that sometimes you'd rather wish you'd have stayed home.
Way back when, you actually looked forward to traveling to the destination.

 The response by airlines to customers' demands for lower and lower fares has been to do exactly that, lower seat 
costs, but at the same time to strip more and more of what is included in the fare out of the price.
 This process - referred to by Time[1] as 'the unbundled skies' - points to a business model that I see becoming 
more prevalent, and not just in the heavens, as price-sensitive brands lower entry points in order to get customers 
to commit, and then use 'upgrades' to restore margin and, according to the article, add another 50% or so to the 
real price. Pay less, get less. Want more? Pay more. Ryanair have even suggested, somewhat controversially, that 
'more' could include access to the toilet. In fact, according to one consultant quoted, there are up to 35 add-ons 
available when you fly, ranging from baggage and food fees to flight-delay insurance and keeping the middle seat 
empty. You literally get what you pay for.
 This seems like an expedient answer to customers' demands for cheaper goods. Lure them in - then trick them into 
paying more. It's not exactly customer-friendly but at least, some would argue, it's a way to compete.
 True, but changing the competitive model this way is not without its consequences. One is that as the product itself 
becomes less valuable and valued, service now comes not just at, but with, a price. That in turn shifts the emphasis 
from what customers get to what do they not get, and what shortfalls they are prepared to do without.
 For the moment what's happening in the aviation sector amounts potentially to a complete economic rebalance of 
the product at that end of the market. As the article points out, 'In the unbundled world, airfare is merely the price of 
admission to get on a jet. If you crave comfort, convenience, less stress, decent food — what was once called good 
service — expect to pay up.'
 In time, the service[2] itself, not the seat, will become the real competition point, as customers look to 'build their 
own flights' made up of base product and services that they are prepared to 'add to cart'. Staff meantime will find 
themselves being judged on their ability to up-and cross-sell services in order to make targets.
 We shouldn't be surprised. As sectors continue to fill with competitors, radicalization of branded business models is 
inevitable, with all-included at one end of the market and not-included at the other, and increasingly little between 
them.
Transaction Mode: Danger For Brands
 While the model has far wider applicability than the airline industry, the dilemma for brands in such a scenario is 
that when you uncouple what people get from how you want people to feel, you reduce every part of the experience 
to a transaction, and every element of loyalty to the same level.
 Everything becomes 'do I or don't I?'
 As to where this might go, well that seems fairly predictable too. As the fight for seats gives way to loss leader seat 
strategy, and a squabble over a la carte services and the quality and profitability of those services, medium-term 
we'll probably see airlines respond by using a mix of lower fares, bundled services and loyalty incentives to adjust 
and respond to value perceptions.

Minister Donohoe, at the autumn campaign launch.
 Tourism Ireland and Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport Paschal Donohoe have launched an €11m 
promotional campaign to boost late-season travel to Ireland from around the world.
 The September to December period usually yields as much as 30% of Ireland's annual overseas tourism business 
and Tourism Ireland is looking to capitalise on the potential this period brings.
 The campaign will highlight the many festivals and events taking place right around the island this autumn - from 
the Dublin Festival Season (which includes Tiger Dublin Fringefest, the Dublin Theatre Festival, Open House Dublin 
and the Bram Stoker Festival), to Culture Night, the Belfast Festival at Queens, Wexford Festival Opera, Savour 
Kilkenny Food Festival, Cork Jazz Festival and the Galway International Oyster and Seafood Festival.
Tourism Ireland will also continue to highlight Limerick City of Culture, including the many literary-themed events 
and activities taking place this autumn - taking every opportunity to leverage the tourism benefits of this year-long 
celebration of culture for the city.
 The campaign - which is being rolled out in Great Britain, the United States, mainland Europe, Australia and 
emerging markets - will incorporate a major focus on city breaks as well as on attracting visitors to more rural areas 
over the coming months.
 Highlights of the activity include co-operative promotions with Aer Lingus, Ryanair and Stena Line, transatlantic 
and long-haul airlines like United Airlines, Air Canada rouge and Emirates; TV, radio, print and online advertising; 
as well as extensive digital, PR and social media activity.
 Tourism Ireland CEO Niall Gibbons said: 'We have seen strong growth of almost +10% in overseas visitors to 
Ireland for the first seven months of 2014. We are determined to keep that momentum going and ensure that 
tourism growth continues. Our autumn campaign aims to take advantage of late booking trends in our target 
markets, as there is still plenty of business to play for. Many people are opting for shorter holiday breaks and 
autumn is a good opportunity with many world-class festivals and events happening around the island.'

 Boeing announced today the launch of the Boeing 737 MAX 200 with a big customer order. Ryanair ordered 100 
planes.Low-cost carrier Ryanair will be the first airline to operate the 737 MAX 200, a variant based on the Boeing 
737 MAX 8 that can accommodate up to 200 seats, increasing revenue potential and providing customers up to 
20% better fuel efficiency per seat than today's most efficient single-aisle airplanes.In addition to the order, valued 
at $11 billion at current list prices, Ryanair has options to purchase another 100 Boeing 737 MAX 200s."Ryanair is 
proud and honored to become the lead operator of Boeing's 'gamechanger' 737 MAX 200, which will expand our 
fleet to 520 aircraft by 2024 and create another 3,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers in Europe, while 
allowing us to grow traffic from 82 million last year to over 150 million annually by 2024," said Ryanair CEO Michael 
O'Leary."These new "gamechanger" aircraft will allow Ryanair to lower our costs and airfares, while improving our 
customer experience with more leg room and the Boeing Sky Interior, as we roll out new offers, particularly for our 
Business Plus and Family Extra customers. 
As many of Europe's flag carriers cut capacity on short haul routes, Ryanair looks forward to using these new 
Boeing 737 MAX 200s to grow at many more of Europe's primary airports," said O'Leary.Boeing developed the 737 
MAX 200 in response to the needs of the fast growing low-cost sector, which is forecasted to account for 35% of 
single-aisle airline capacity by 2033. While the heart of the single-aisle market will remain at 160 seats, the 737 
MAX 200 will provide carriers like Ryanair with up to 11 more seats of potential revenue and up to 5% lower 
operating costs than the 737 MAX 8, driving economic growth and increasing access to air travel.Based on the 
Boeing 737 MAX 8 airframe, the Boeing 737 MAX 200 can accommodate up to 200 seats by incorporating a mid-
exit door increasing the exit limit. The airframe is 2.2 meters longer than the A320neo, giving customers more 
flexibility and space in the cabin, and offering a better solution at both the heart of the single-aisle market (160 
seats) and at maximum passenger configurations.Standard across the 737 MAX family, Ryanair's 737 MAX 200s 
will be configured with the passenger inspired Boeing Sky Interior, featuring modern sculpted sidewalls and window 
reveals, LED lighting that enhances the sense of spaciousness and larger pivoting overhead stowage bins.

Sep 09, 2014 (Zacks Investment Research:http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 Leading commercial aircraft maker The Boeing Company (BA[1]) received a large order for its latest model, the 
737 MAX 200, from European low-cost carrier Ryanair (RYAAY[2]). Ryanair, the launch customer, has committed to 
purchase 100 737 MAX 200 aircraft valued at $11 billion at list prices. The airline has options to purchase another 
100 aircraft. The news boosted the share price of Boeing by 2.64% yesterday with shares closing at $127.98.
 Benefits of a Non-Diverse Fleet
 Ryanair's fleet already has more than 300 Boeing aircraft and the new orders will expand the operating fleet to 520 
aircraft by 2024. Ryanair's decision to keep its fleet fuel efficient will keep operating costs under check helping the 
airline to pass on the benefits to its passengers.
 Historically, we have seen that airline operators worldwide try to keep their fleet as non-diverse as possible. It not 
only helps to cut down on operating expenses but also ensures better after-sales services from the manufacturers.
 Boeing's 737 Family
 Boeing's 737 model is one of the best-selling planes in the single-aisle market, primarily due to its fuel efficiency 
and passenger comfort. To maintain its dominance in the commercial aerospace market, Boeing continues to invest 
in research and development to upgrade and churn out newer models of existing airplanes. The 737 MAX 200 is an 
upgraded variant of the 737 MAX 8.
 737 MAX 200 is expected to be 20% more fuel efficient than the current single-aisle airplanes in its category and 
will accommodate more passengers, increasing revenue passenger miles. Operating costs of 737 MAX 200 will be 
5% lower than the 737 MAX 8.
 Global Picture 
Boeing Rises on $22 Billion 737 MAX 200 Order from Ryanair - Analyst Blog
 Boeing's continued rivalry with another giant commercial aircraft maker - Airbus - led to the making of this aircraft. 
This new model, which is 2.2 meters longer than the A320neo and configured on the lines of Boeing Sky Interior, 
ensures improved passenger comfort.
 Boeing projects global demand for commercial airplanes to increase to 36,770 airplanes valued at $5.2 trillion by 
2033. Nearly 70% of the new airplanes are expected to be of the single-aisle variant. Boeing hopes to take 
dominance over this space with its evolving 737 MAX models.
 Zacks Rank 
 Boeing carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Besides having a stronghold in the commercial airplane manufacturing 
market, Boeing has a prominent defense presence. Investors interested in the aerospace and defense industry may 
consider better-ranked stocks like General Dynamics Corp. (GD[3]) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC[4]), 
both holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Ryanair boosts Boeing sales buying 100 planes

 Irish airline Ryanair has announced it will purchase 100 Boeing aircraft under efforts to double passenger numbers 
over the next decade. The budget carrier has also secured an option for an additional 100 planes. Ryanair's order, 
announced on Monday, covers the 737 MAX 200 plane, touted by Boeing as a fuel-efficient vehicle for the 
important single-aisle civilian market.
 According to the US aircraft maker's price list, the order would be worth a maximum of $11 billion (8.5 billion euros) 
for 100 planes. However, an order of this size usually carries a discount in the double-digit percentage region.
 Ryanair said the purchase would enable it to meet its growth targets, which call for an increase in passenger 
numbers from an estimated 82 million in 2014 to about 150 million in 2024.
 Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told a news conference in Dublin, Ireland, that the order would "change 
the game for low-fare air travel in Europe."
 O'Leary also said Ryanair was planning to use the jets to enter new markets in Europe and challenge incumbent 
carriers such as Germany's Lufthansa and French carrier Air France.
 "I hope it will hasten a new era of price wars in Europe over the next 10 years," he added.
 Ryanair is the launch customer for the 737 MAX 200, the latest version of the venerable 737, which will 
accommodate up to 200 passengers.
 The Dublin-based budget carrier says it will likely fit the planes with 197 seats - eight more than in its current 737 
fleet, and considerably more than the 160 seats typical for other single-aisle planes.
 Airlines have already ordered more than 2,200 737 MAX jets. Boeing expects to deliver the plane in 2017, 50 years 
after the first 737 model flew. Its main competitor is the Airbus A320 neo, which is expected to enter service at the 
end of 2015.
 In 2013, Ryanair already bought 175 Boeing planes of the current 737-800 type for $15.6 billion. O'Leary said the 
airline would stick to the order in spite of Boeing's upgrade.
 Ryanair only uses Boeing 737 aircraft, of which it has 303 in operation, with plans to enlarge this fleet to 500 by 
2019.

http://www.nycaviation.com/newspage/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/heartone_print005.jpgSouthwest 
Airlines introduced the elements of its new branding[1] on Monday morning, in an unveiling attended by employees 
and the media. The event followed a weekend that was filled with speculation and leaked photos all over social 
media. The branding elements are based upon an updated color scheme centered on a new 'Bold Blue' color. In 
addition to a new livery for Southwest's aircraft, a new take on the airline's heart-shaped logo was unveiled. The 
airline plans to introduce this new branding to the airports across its network in the coming months. New uniforms 
for the airline's employees are also planned.
 Over the years, Southwest Airlines has not been known for making drastic changes to its image. This is most 
evident in the airline's choice of airplane over the years. Southwest has historically operated a fleet that was almost 
exclusively made up of Boeing 737s. Southwest launched with a fleet of 737-200s in the early 1970s, a type which it 
flew until 2005. The 1980s saw the introduction of the 737-300 and -500 to the fleet, some of which are still flying 
today. Southwest was the launch customer for the 737-700, and today it forms the backbone of the fleet with over 
400 in service. The 737-800 was added to the fleet in 2012, bringing increased capacity to routes that are busy or 
face slot constraints. The future sees Southwest as the launch customer for both the 737 MAX 7 and Max 8, with 
200 firm aircraft orders and another 191 options.

Southwest's livery has similarly seen a series of evolutionary updates over the years. The airline launched and rose 
to its position as a domestic powerhouse wearing the classic 'Desert Gold' livery. The livery consisted of gold, red, 
and orange stripes on the tail, with the gold and red stripes transitioning onto the top and bottom of the fuselage 
respectively. Thin white lines between each stripe added definition. The word 'Southwest' in all capital letters was 
written in white over the gold tail stripe. Desert Gold was so integral to the brand's identity over 30 years that the 
iconic livery remains painted on three aircraft in the fleet to this day as a retrojet livery.

Southwest Airlines Unveils Updated Livery and Logo
In 2001, Southwest unveiled its Canyon Blue 'Spirit livery' for the airline's 30th anniversary. Spirit replaced the 
classic gold color that was dominant in the Desert Gold scheme with a vibrant blue. the line between the blue top of 
the fuselage and the red bottom became a smoothly curving line. The thin white stripes between the colors were 
replaced with yellow and made slightly wider. The 'Southwest' titles on the tail remained as before, though now they 
were yellow instead of white. The winglets, on aircraft so equipped, mimicked the tail design. The Spirit livery was a 
bold departure from Desert Gold in terms of the dominant color, however in most other respects, the livery 
remained very similar to the original. It was more an evolution in livery than a revolution.
            http://www.nycaviation.com/newspage/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/heartone_print012.jpgWith today's 
rebranding announcement comes a brand new livery for the company's aircraft, the Heart livery. While the Heart 
livery is boldly different in some ways, it remains an evolution of the original design. The core tail design of three 
dominant tail stripes remains, now in Sunrise Yellow, Warm Red and Bold Blue. The thinner, separating stripes 
have become wider still and the color become a shiny Summit Silver. While the initial two aircraft in the new livery 
are equipped with new split scimitar winglets, the use of a design similar to the tail is retained on the upper portion 
of these.
 There are a few significant changes that have been made to the livery in this redesign. No longer does the center 
tail stripe form the bottom color for the fuselage. Instead, each tail stripe now wraps around the underside of the 
rear fuselage but does not continue forward. The dominant fuselage color, both top and bottom, is what the airline 
has named 'Bold Blue'. Another, more noticeable change, is in the placement and style of the titles. They have 
moved from the tail to the forward fuselage, and have taken on the popular large 'billboard' styling used by many 
airlines including American, JetBlue, Frontier, and Ryanair. These titles continue to use the highlight color, just as 
they always have, making them silver in the new design.
            http://www.nycaviation.com/newspage/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/heartone_print007.jpg Less noticeable, 
and yet an important part of the new design, is the inclusion of the airline's new Heart logo. The new logo uses a 
design similar to the tail with diagonal stripes of yellow, red, and blue, each separated by thin silver stripes. The 
new logo is found in five locations on each aircraft's exterior: as the 'dot' in Southwest.com on each engine, next to 
the forward doors on each side of the fuselage, and most prominently on the belly of each aircraft forward of the 
engines.
            http://www.nycaviation.com/newspage/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/New-Lone-Star-One.jpgIn keeping with 
Southwest's practice of naming special aircraft in its fleet, the first two aircraft in the fleet to bear the new livery 
(both are brand new 737-800s) have been named HeartOne and HeartTwo. Southwest is an airline that has 
become well known for its many eye-catching special schemes, and those will continue. Aircraft bearing special 
schemes will have a modified tail design that does not extend onto the fuselage, while maintaining the overall 
appearance of the new design. The titles will also be placed horizontally across the base of the tail, instead of on 
the forward fuselage. Southwest has also announced that Warrior One, the airline's first 737-800, will retain the 
classic Spirit livery as a retrojet.
            http://www.nycaviation.com/newspage/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/heartone_print008.jpgSo how long will it 
take Southwest to put all of this branding in place? The facilities at the airline's Dallas Love Field base were 
converted to the new colors overnight. An additional two airports will receive it by the end of 2014. The remaining 
airports in the network should be fully rebranded by the end of 2016. Aircraft will take significantly longer to receive 
the new paint. The airline's goals to keep the costs of rebranding as low as possible means that Southwest expects 
that it will take seven years to fully repaint the fleet. Meanwhile, the redesign of employee uniforms is just 
beginning. Those will be rolled out later on in the conversion process.
 As with any time an airline receives a new livery, plane spotters should enjoy the opportunities a new livery brings. 
Be it searching for their first shot of the new paint, trying to capture each special livery with its new tail, or trying to 
catch a few final shots of the Spirit livery, the hunt has begun.

 Cantor Fitzgerald Canada analyst Justin Kew says yesterday's contract renewal news gives him confidence that 
Guestlogix can reach similar deals with United, Alaska and Ryanair, which are all due in the second half of 2014. 
The renewal and expansion of an existing contract with an an unnamed Asia-Pacific based carrier is a positive sign 
that Guestlogix (TSX:GXI) can reach other, similar deals, says Cantor Fitzgerald Canada analyst Justin Kew.
Yesterday, Guestlogix announced that a deal had been reached with said carrier to continue the use of Guestlogix's 
onboard retailing technology. CEO Brett Proud commented on the deal.
 'We are pleased to have earned the continued trust and confidence of this Asia-Pacific carrier and remain 
committed to providing seamless retailing on board its fleet,' he said. 'With this renewal and technology upgrade, we 
will implement our PCI-compliant hand-held POS devices to enable chip and PIN payments on board, further 
protecting both the airline and its passengers. At the same time, our business intelligence platform will be deployed 
to gain further insights into the airline's retail performance, enhancing its ability to make informed business 
decisions.' 
 Kew thinks the unnamed carrier is likely Qantas, pointing to the fact that a deal with that airline was announced 
four years ago, on September 13th, 2010. He says the deal, paired with the recent successful re-upping of 
Southwest Airlines, gives him confidence that other pending renewals will take place, including those with United, 
Alaska and Ryanair, which are all due in the second half of 2014. The analyst says he also expects good news on 
the traction of the company's in-flight entertainment efforts in the same time period. 
 In a research update to clients yesterday, Kew maintained his 'Buy' rating and $2.00 one-year target on Guestlogix, 
implying a return of 65% at the time of publication.

 The new chairman of Fáilte Ireland has said the tourism bosy intends to spend up to €20m to improve Dublin's 
image, in a bid to attract more tourists.
 Former Ryanair deputy chief executive Michael Cawley also said the city needs a striking brand logo, similar to the 
'I Heart NY' logo used by New York.
Mr. Cawley believes Dublin's literary and sporting heritage should be pushed to the fore if Dublin is to compete on a 
European level.
 'We need to clean up its image. Temple Bar, long an asset, has become less than an asset, shall we say. I don't 
want to be overly negative about it, but we need to do better,' he said in an interview with the Sunday Business 
Post.
 A Fáilte Ireland task force is to be established in the coming months to create a new logo and brand message for 
Dublin, with €20m being allocated to the group over the next three years.

 While no major event impacted the Airline industry over the past 5 trading days, airline stocks tend to deliver mixed 
performances with most of them reflecting a bearish momentum. However, news that caught the eye in the past 
one week were JetBlue Airways Corporation's (JBLU[1]) service expansion; United Continental Holdings Inc.'s 
(UAL[2]) new service offering and American Airlines Group Inc.'s (AAL[3]) fallout with Orbitz Worldwide Inc. 
(OWW[4]).
 A Recap of Last Week's Most Important Stories
 1. Passengers availing JetBlue Airways' services will now have access to more flying options with the carrier's 
latest decision to fly south to Jacksonville - a city with the highest population in the state of Florida. The New York-
based carrier plans to add two daily non-stop flights to Jacksonville International airport (JAX) from Reagan 
National Airport (DCA) on and from Dec 18, 2014. The launch will coincide with the carrier's two new daily flights 
from DCA to Fort Myers (RSW) and West Palm Beach (PBI) in Florida (read more: JetBlue Expands Washington 
DC Service with Florida Flights[5]).
 2. United Continental Holdings Inc. has launched intriguing food and beverage options for its domestic premium 
customers. The latest offering will include four new salad choices, replacing the previous chicken and shrimp salad 
options (read more: United Airlines to Better Dining Options for Domestic Fliers[6]).
 3. Premier passenger carrier American Airlines severed its ties with online travel company Orbitz Worldwide Inc. 
This resulted from the two companies failing to reach an agreement on their long-term dispute over fees..American 
Airlines notified that no settlement could be made over the fees that Orbitz charged customers buying American 
Airlines tickets buying from the latter's websites. As a result the nation's largest carrier has already withdrawn its 
fares from Orbitz and two of its affiliate websites - Cheaptickets.com and ebookers.com. Beginning Sep 1, the 
carrier will also drop U.S. Airways listings from Orbitz.

 4. Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK[7]) announced its Fall Award Sale of the year. Mileage Plan members of the 
company can now boost their frequent flier miles starting Aug 26 through Oct 31. Members can travel for as low as 
5,000 miles one-way, which represents 60% discount on a standard award-level ticket.
 5. Further, European low cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY[8]) is expected to submit a non-binding offer for 
Cyprus Airways on Friday as part of its strategy to extend its footprint in East Europe to tap opportunities in tourist 
destinations popular among Russian and Israeli visitors.
 Performance 
 The following table shows the price movements of the major airline players over the past 5 trading days and during 
the last 6 months:
 Over the trailing 5 sessions, most airline stocks reflected a negative trend with the exception of Southwest Airlines 
Co. and Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE[9]) which trended on a positive note with 1.1% and nearly 1% gain, respectively. 
Biggest losers over the past five-day trading sessions include American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL[10]) and Copa 
Holdings with 3.7% and 2.6% decline, respectively.
 However, over the past 6 months, most of the stocks have fared reasonably well except forCopa Holdings, which 
dropped 7.3%. The biggest gainers in the 6-month span were Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airwayssporting 
growth of 43.2% and 37.6%, respectively.
 What's Next in the Airline Biz?
 In the current week, we foresee no significant changes in the airline industry and global economic factors also 
remain gloomy. As a result, we expect no significant momentum in trading for the remainder of this week.

7 Retaliatory Fees Travelers Should Be Charging the Airlines

            http://lenpenzo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/travel-airplane.jpgOne of the greatest technological 
achievements[1] of the modern era is, unquestionably, the turbine engine. The invention ushered in the jet age, 
which bestowed upon mankind the luxury of safe and rapid transcontinental and intercontinental travel at 
reasonable prices.
 Unfortunately, those reasonable prices are being chipped away by a growing number of annoying fees[2] that 
many airlines impose on their passengers including:
 transporting your luggage securing a couple of extra inches of leg room choosing an aisle or window seat changing 
your reservation printing boarding passes getting a better position in the boarding queue redeeming frequent flier 
miles snacks
 Yes, many of these fees are for services that were once considered complimentary — and the reason is obvious. 
For example, according to CNBC[3], baggage fees are so lucrative that they now account for 25% of the airlines' 
ancillary revenue.
 At one point, the airlines' quest to nickel-and-dime its customers got so out of hand that Irish discount carrier 
Ryanair actually considered charging passengers approximately $1.50 to use their planes' toilets[4]. Thankfully, 
saner heads prevailed and the idea was eventually dumped[5] — er, if you'll pardon the expression.
 Turning the Tables
 Wouldn't it be great if two could play this game?
 What if us frustrated air travelers[6] could assemble our own list of absurd fees that we could charge the airlines?
 Well, if I were king for a day, here are a few of my own fees that I'd slap on the airlines. And, by all means, feel free 
to pile on and add your own charges to the list.
 Small Seat Fee. It's not your imagination. As the Wall Street Journal points out, even though the typical waistline is 
getting larger, airlines are transitioning to smaller seats[7] so their planes can hold more passengers. Sadly, I don't 
think there is an airline in business today that could avoid this fee.
 Excessive Boarding Groups Fee. Remember when the airlines boarded their First Class passengers, followed by 
everyone else via row numbers? It was simple, quick and efficient. Nowadays, airlines have so many special status 
labels with their own place in the boarding pecking order that it's comical. American Airlines offers approximately a 
dozen preferred categories[8] that permit 'elite' customers to board ahead of the unwashed masses (a.k.a. Groups 
1 through 4) including: First Class, Business Class, AAdvantage Platinum, AAdvantage Gold, AAdvantage Silver, 
7 Retaliatory Fees Travelers Should Be Charging the Airlines
oneworld Ruby, oneworld Emerald/Sapphire, Dividend Miles Platinum, Dividend Miles Gold, Dividend Miles Silver, 
AAirpass, and Priority. The trouble is, when everyone is elite, nobody is.
 Kicked Seat Fee. I know. Flying with young kids is a huge challenge for almost any parent. But that doesn't mean 
anybody should have to put up with having their seat being continually kicked from behind by an unruly 
whippersnapper — especially on a long flight. If the airline insists on sitting me in one of those cursed seats, I want 
to be compensated for the ensuing frustration.
 Lost Baggage Fee. I don't care if they eventually deliver the bags to my front door: If the airlines insist on charging 
a fee to carry my luggage, then I'll charge them a fee whenever they lose it.
 Non-reclining Seat Fee. Yes, another seat fee — if you don't like it, make your own list. There's a good reason why 
the seats in front of any exit row do not recline. That being said, if I have to be stuck in one of those seats — or a 
similar seat in the last row — then I'm going to charge a fee. Sorry.
 Missing Gate Assignment Fee. One of the more frustrating aspects of flying is arriving at your destination after a 
long flight, only to find yourself immediately stuck on the tarmac because there are no available gates at the 
terminal — which brings us to my most expensive fee of all:
 Hurry Up and Wait Fee. Of course, the airlines will tell you that, when it comes to air travel, delays due to missing 
gate assignments, interminable TSA queues, equipment problems, schedule logjams[9], and 'acts of God,' come 
with the territory. Then again, so does passenger luggage. Hey … What's good for the goose is good for the 
gander.

 Is there a clearer manifestation of the "I'm gonna get mine and screw everyone else" mentality than this story? 4-
year-old Fae Platten lost consciousness on a plane when a man four rows behind her insisted on eating nuts, 
despite being warned three times not to open the package.[1]
 http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/PAY-Fae-Platten-and-her-Dad-Dean-on-the-flight-out-
to-Tenerife.jpg After boarding the Ryanair flight to London Stansted[2], concerned cabin crew made the three 
separate announcements, warning of three passengers onboard with nut allergies. But a man sat four rows away 
from Fae's family ignored the warnings and opened the snack, causing the youngster's face to immediately swell 
up.
Although her worried mum, Katy, 30, rushed her daughter to the front of the plane, the air conditioning meant there 
was no way she could get away from the nut particles circulating in the air. An emergency call was put out for 
medical staff on board and an ambulance worker leapt into action administering the youngster's epi pen - the first 
time she has needed it. Maybe the passenger was just totally oblivious--although it's hard to believe someone could 
"forget" after being warned three times. Or maybe he's a self-centered jerk who doesn't care. Either way, I'm sure 
banning him from the airline would teach him an important lesson.

Politicians must take on transport 'taboos' to curb emissions

 Technology alone will not cut transport pollution enough, say researchers - the rich must travel less
 Airlines like Virgin are proud of their green credentials, but are also expanding rapidly (Pic: Virgin Airlines)
By Megan Darby[1]
 Sustainable transport policies will fail unless 'taboos' around air and car travel are broken, researchers have 
warned.
 Green technology alone cannot cut transport emissions enough to meet emissions targets, say the experts from 
Lund University and the University of Surrey.
 Policymakers need to take on the high-flying elite who are responsible for most transport emissions, according to 
the study.
 'The richest and politically powerful contribute the most to global carbon emissions,' study co-author Scott Cohen 
told RTCC.
 'Ironically they are offered rewards for this behaviour with air miles, as well as earning prestige among peers who 
view international travel as a status symbol.
 'Our research explores how these transport taboos are driving policies that are contradictory to carbon emission 
targets.'
 Report: Rise in air travel likely to overpower carbon cuts[2]
 Transport accounts for nearly a third of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU and demand is rising.
 Between 1990 and 2007, transport emissions grew by 36%, while emissions from all other sectors fell by 15%.
 Globally, the International Energy Agency expects the number of passenger cars to double by 2035 and air travel 
to triple by 2050.
 Even with improvements in the energy efficiency of vehicles and use of biofuels, that is set to substantially increase 
transport's share of emissions.
 In the EU, the European Commission aims to cut transport emissions 20% by 2030, from 2008 levels. However, it 
says 'curbing mobility is not an option'.
 This is at odds with other studies showing use of energy-intensive forms of transport must be curbed to achieve 
absolute emissions cuts, the report notes.
Politicians must take on transport 'taboos' to curb emissions
 This means air travel, which is the least taxed and most subsidised form of transport. Low-cost airline Ryanair is 
estimated to have received subsidies worth €800 million in a single year.
 Kevin Anderson: 'The fox is having to protect the chickens'
 Play Video[3][embedded content]
 Cohen blamed the influence of the transport lobby.
 'Politicians continue to ignore evidence of what works in favour of optimistic headlines about technological 
innovation, driven by industry and lobbyists,' said Cohen.
 'There is a lot of exaggeration surrounding 'wonder' technologies that promise to reduce carbon levels while 
allowing privileged sections of society to continue to travel without limits. These optimistic claims are largely 
undebated in political circles, as this would force politicians to face some harsh truths.'
 Indeed, politicians tend to belong to the elite group of frequent flyers who are not willing to travel less.
 And when the EU has attempted to act, it has been slowed down by international opposition.
 Attempts to put a price on carbon emissions from long-haul flights have been put on hold[4] after countries 
including the US, China and India kicked up a fuss.

Poles outnumber other immigrants in Norway

 Published on Wednesday, 13th August[1], 2014[2] at 00:22 under the columns[3] category, by M. Michael Brady[4]. 
Last Updated on 13th August 2014 at 00:48.
The Pakistani-Norwegian community grew to be the largest immigrant minority in Norway from the late 1960s when 
the first Pakistani immigrated to Norway. No more. Polish immigrants now are more numerous.
 The Pakistani-Norwegian community still is the largest group of immigrants from outside Europe, but the Swedish 
and Polish immigrant communities are now larger. First, second and now third-generation immigrants from more 
than 200 countries and regions now make up 13.1% of the population of the country as a whole, and 28.4% of the 
population of Oslo.
 Numbers of Poles now in Norway reflects the internationalization of the European labour market, most significantly 
since Poland became a member of the European Union (EU) in 2004. Norway is not a member of the EU, but is a 
member of the EEA and has access to the internal market of the EU provided it implements relevant EU legislation, 
which to date concerns more than 7,000 matters, including labour.
 The Polish immigrant community in Norway grew rapidly after 2004 to become the country's largest in 2008. 
According to a recent survey conducted by website mojanorwegia.pl[5], the Internet portal for Poles in Norway, 
there now are an estimated 200,000 Poles in the Scandinavian country.
 The average immigrant of the survey is a young man, 25 to 35 years old, working in construction or industry. He 
has settled or plans to settle in Norway, but doesn't rule out returning to Poland. He is well integrated and has a 
working familiarity with, or is moderately fluent in Norwegian - though a tenth of Polish workers admit to not being 
able to communicate in the language.
 An international business study conducted by the INSEAD business school published in the European Journal of 
Management in 2008 shows that the Poles are an extremely entrepreneurial people. Polish immigrants have taken 
that trait to Norway. An estimated 30% of all Poles working in the building trades have their own Norwegian-
registered sole proprietorships or small incorporated companies.
 Aside from conversations in Polish being more frequently heard on construction sites and in public places, there's 
subtle evidence of the increasing number of Poles in Norway. Most Poles are Catholic, so the Catholic Church in 
Norway[6] is expanding its facilities and now offers migrant chaplaincies in Polish and other minority languages. 
That trend is most evident in Oslo, as some 90% of the 85,000 registered Catholics in Norway live in the Oslo 
bishopric.
Poles outnumber other immigrants in Norway
 Some Polish labour immigrants shuttle weekly between their homes in Poland and their jobs in Norway. 
Accordingly, two low-cost airlines offer direct flights between Norway and Poland, Wizz Air (Hungary) to/from six 
Polish cities and Ryanair (Ireland) to/from 11 cities.
 The Polish presence is more apparent than ever in today's Norway, but builds on more than two hundred years of 
cultural interaction (see Further reading). In the early 19th Century, Norwegian poet, playwright and linguist Henrik 
Wergeland[7] (1808-1845) supported Polish independence and translated Polish poetry into Norwegian. In 1934, a 
Polish scientific expedition to the Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic mapped terrain.
 In so doing, the expedition members named mountain peaks after famed Polish scientists, including mathematician 
Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) and French nationalised physicist Marie Sklodowska-Curie (1867-1934). The 
name Polakkbreen ('Pole Glacier'), a 4 by 15 kilometre ice sheet on Spitzbergen Island, is a lasting reminder of it 
being first mapped by Polish cartographers.

 New Transportation market report from Euromonitor International: "Transportation in Greece"
Boston, MA -- (SBWIRE[1]) -- 08/01/2014 -- Ryanair launched flights from Athens E Venizelos Airport to Rome, 
Milan, London, Brussels and Paphos as well as Crete, Rhodes and Thessaloniki in spring 2014. This is set to boost 
tourism and lead to fierce competition by forcing other airlines to drop their prices in order to compete. 
Pressure will be strong, particularly on the prices of domestic flights, which until recently were only marginally 
cheaper than international ones, making air travel largely unaffordable for the Greek population.
Industry Prospects
The chauffeur-driven cars category is expected to continue to enjoy strong growth over the forecast period, 
registering a value CAGR of 48% at constant 2013 prices to be the best performing transportation type. However, 
the category's share of overall transportation sales will remain marginal.

 If love makes your heart soar, this young lad's heartfelt campaign will have you flying.
Jamie Kelly, a 24-year-old Irishman, met Katie, a charming young woman from Canada, last week when the two sat 
next to each other on a Ryanair flight from Barcelona to Dublin[1]. The pair hit it off immediately, reports Breaking 
News Ireland, and talked throughout the entire flight. 
In the hubbub of disembarking from the plane and going through customs, however, the smitten passengers lost 
each other before they could exchange contact information. Kelly waited and looked for Katie after passing through 
customs, but he couldn't find the mystery woman.
Undeterred, he set off on an epic search, scouring the Internet in search of the woman he knew only as "Katie." 
"I originally looked for her Facebook and couldn't find her," Kelly recalled to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation 
last week. "And I went to the airline and they couldn't do anything for me. So then I went on the [Irish radio] D'Arcy 
Show today and they couldn't find her.'
So he enlisted Twitter to help in the search, uniting the effort under the hashtags #loveatfirstflight[2] and 
#findkatie[3]:
Is your name Katie? Are you from Nova Scotia? Are you travelling around Ireland? Did you recently meet a young 
lad called Jamie? #findkatie[4] — Niamh Hassell (@niamhhassell) August 1, 2014[5]

her. #loveatfirstflight[8] — gerard blaine (@gblaineofficial) August 1, 2014[9]
 Eventually, after Kelly appeared on several Canadian news outlets, Katie's sister connected the dots and helped 
set up a meeting between the two Wednesday.

surprised and flattered" by Kelly's efforts. 
Twitter Reunites Lovebirds Who Met On Flight To Dublin
"When I was on the plane I talked to him incessantly," she said. "We had lots in common plus he was very easy on 
the eyes."
Katie added she had also searched for the "handsome Irishman" after she'd cleared customs but was afraid of 
looking desperate. "I thought I might have scared him off actually from all the talking[16]," she told Ireland's Today 
FM. "I suppose, in hindsight, looking a bit longer wouldn't seem as desperate in comparison."
The two have plans to meet soon. Love, as they say, is in the air.

Airline Stock Roundup: Virgin America , Southwest in Focus - Analyst Blog
Airline Stock Roundup: Virgin America, Southwest in Focus - Analyst Blog

Aug 06, 2014 (Zacks Investment Research:http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 Despite the earnings season on in full swing, airline stocks remained lackluster over the past one week. Improved 
quarterly results posted by most of the carriers made no significant impact on the industry overall, leading to most of 
the stocks trading in the red through the week. 
 Some of the major highlights from the past week include earnings announcements by U.S. and European carriers. 
In addition, initiation of Virgin America's IPO launch and hefty fines imposed on Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV[1]) for 
non-compliance of maintenance regulations also made headlines last week.
 A Recap of Last Week's Most Important Stories
 1. Airline giant Air France-KLM SA (AFLYY[2]) reported first-half 2014 adjusted loss of €1.16 per share ($1.59), 
narrower than the loss of €2.32 ($3.05) incurred in the first half of 2013. Total operating revenue in the first half of 
2014 came in at €12.01 billion ($16.50 billion), which declined 1.78% from the comparable period last year. Foreign 
exchange affected results to the tune of €287 million ($394.7 million) (read more: Air France-KLM (AFLYY) 1H14 
Loss Narrows, Revenues Drop Y/Y[3]).
 2. Another carrier, Spirit Airlines Co. (SAVE[4]) reported second-quarter 2014 earnings of 91 cents per share, 
beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Earnings, however, surged 44.4% from 63 cents reported in the 
prior-year quarter (read more: Spirit Airlines Beats Q2 Earnings, Revenues on Higher Demand[5]).
 3. Europe's leading low fare airline Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY[6]) reported first-quarter fiscal 2015 adjusted 
earnings of €196.8 million ($270.0 million), up by a whopping 152% owing to rise in average fares and strong load 
factor, partially offset by higher operating expenses (read more: Ryanair Q1 Earnings and Revenues Rise, Profit 
Guidance Up[7]).
 4. Low-cost U.S. airline Virgin America has finally filed a registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) to launch its Initial Public offering (IPO). The California-based carrier has well timed its IPO 
given a recovering U.S. aviation market (read more: Virgin America Files for IPO amid High US Airline Earnings[8]).
Airline Stock Roundup: Virgin America , Southwest in Focus - Analyst Blog
 5. Southwest Airlines may end up paying one of the heftiest fines ever charged by the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA). The regulator has alleged the carrier for non-compliance of maintenance regulations in some 
of its 737 jetliners. The Dallas-based carrier has a months' time to respond to the proposed charges (read more: 
Faulty Jet Repairs to Cost Southwest Airlines $12 Million[9]).
 Performance 
 The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past 5 trading days and during 
the last 6 months:
 Over the trailing 5 sessions, all the airline stocks listed above exhibited bearish trends. The biggest losers were 
United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL[10]), Hawaiian Holdings Inc. (HA[11]) and American Airlines Group Inc. 
(AAL[12]), which dropped 6.5%, 6.2% and 5.8%, respectively.
 However, over the past 6 months, most of the stocks have fared reasonably well. The biggest gainers in the 6-
month span were GOL Linhas A and Spirit Airlines sporting growth of 49.5% and 44.2%, respectively.
 What's Next in the Airline Biz?
 In the current week, we foresee no significant recovery in the global as well as the U.S. market that can possibly 
uplift the price potential of the airline stocks. As a result, we continue to expect sluggish trading for the remainder of 
this week as well.

Ryanair Plans To Offer Transatlantic Flights For Less Than £10
Ryanair Plans To Offer Transatlantic Flights For Less Than £10
The Huffington Post

Feb 28, 2014 (The Huffington Post:http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ Delivered by Newstex) Even for Ryanair, this is 
too crazy to be true. 
 Ryanair[1], the love-to-hate Irish airline, hopes to offer transatlantic flights at crazy low prices one day. 
 According to the Telegraph[2], Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told the Irish Hotels Federation conference 
Tuesday that his airline would offer tickets to New York and Boston for €10 (that's £8.26 or $13.81). Flights back to 
Europe would cost €7.30 (£6.03 or $10.08).
 These insanely cheap flights won't happen, however, until Ryanair acquires the long-haul aircrafts necessary to 
make the flights. And that could take up to five years. 
 O'Leary also admitted that extra fees would apply, charging passengers for everything from luggage to meals. 
Business and first-class seats would also be an additional cost.
 "We can make money on 99 cent fares in Europe,' O'Leary added. 'Not every seat will be €10 of course, there will 
also need to be a very high number of business or premium seats.'
 In October, Norwegian[3], another budget airline, announced they will be offering transatlantic flights at low -- but 
not £10 low -- prices. Norwegian's transatlantic flights start around $240 one way, which is still pretty cheap for a 
flight across the ocean. 
 Ryanair's plan seems pretty far fetched... But if they do get those planes one day, would you fly Ryanair long-haul?

Wilfred Mitchell: We need to expand Belfast City Airport
Wilfred Mitchell: We need to expand Belfast City Airport

 Soapbox[1] on 1 August 2014 0[2] 1,042 views
 A RECENT snap poll conducted by the Federation of Small Businesses for Northern Ireland (FSB NI) has 
confirmed that the majority of local small businesses would like to see an increase in destination routes, as well as 
airline providers, from George Best Belfast City Airport, conveying evident support for expansion at the airport.
 Due to its relatively isolated position on the periphery of Europe, air connectivity is vital in connecting Northern 
Ireland to the rest the UK, Europe and beyond. A huge 96% majority of local small businesses agreed that air 
connectivity drives economic growth by increasing trade destinations as well as bringing increasing visitor numbers 
to the Province. Therefore, FSB NI has been calling for air links from and to Northern Ireland to be regularly 
reviewed and improved.
 This sentiment has increased over the last number of years in particular, following the loss of five UK routes by 
Ryanair in 2010 after a well-publicised vocal outburst of frustration by CEO Michael O'Leary at the failure of 
expansion plans at the airport coming to fruition.
 With increased trade visits being made both by FSB members and local politicians, including the First and Deputy 
First Minister and the Enterprise Minister, Northern Ireland is showcasing first class services and goods on a global 
stage. However, because of the lack of direct routes, these Northern Ireland trade missions are often forced to 
travel via Dublin airport, using the gateway to another economy instead of having being able to fly directly from our 
own.
 Moreover, the increase in visitors that improved air connections bring is of particularly value to short-break tourism, 
additionally boosting other sectors such as hospitality and retail. Hard work has established Northern Ireland as a 
key travel destination, not only as the 'Home of Thrones' but coupled with numerous 'big ticket' international 
attractions such as the Giro D'Italia, Titanic Belfast and the Giants Causeway. However, until expansion occurs, 
many international visitors first have to travel to another country prior to embarking on the trip to Northern Ireland. 
 Alongside the issue of route expansion, there are a number of other operational restrictions placed upon the 
airport. The flight operating hours are restricted to between 6.30am and 9.30pm and there is a bias of flights over 
Belfast Lough but, bizarrely, the airport is also limited to selling only 2,000,000 seats on flights per year. The 
restriction on the seats for sale is an issue that resonates strongly with FSB members, with 86% of respondents 
calling for the removal of this limit.
Wilfred Mitchell: We need to expand Belfast City Airport
 In addition to increasing business opportunity and boosting visitor numbers through greater flight provision, George 
Best Belfast City Airport has highlighted that if expansion of its activities were authorised, it would also produce a 
further 270 local jobs and increase the number of European flights and destinations on offer. Ultimately, in doing so, 
it would increase both direct and indirect economic benefit to the Province.
 A report illustrating the results of the survey undertaken by the FSB's Northern Ireland Policy Unit on George Best 
Belfast City Airport and air connectivity in Northern Ireland is available for download from our website.[3]

            http://www.planebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/home-typewriter-copy-1.jpgThis week's issue of 
PlaneBusiness Banter[1] is now posted. This week we take an in-depth look at the recent earnings reported by 
Southwest Airlines, JetBlue, and Alaska Air Group. We also have summarized takes at Ryanair, IAG, and 
Lufthansa. Finally, we have earnings summaries posted for Spirit and WestJet this week.
 A bit of comment on the foreign flyers in the group - IAG, parent of British Airways, Vueling and Iberia, clearly took 
the top spot this quarter for the major European carriers. Meanwhile, Lufthansa, which had already pre-warned on 
earnings in June, reported numbers that were far worse. This, after Air France-KLM didn't wow anyone with their 
2Q14 earning last month either.
 Another winner across the pond? Ryanair, which easily beat expectations for the quarter.
 On this side of the pond we talk about Southwest Airlines and its aspirations, we muse about how we believe 
Alaska Airlines holds the bulk of the leverage in the Battle for Seattle with Delta Air Lines, and we talk about JetBlue 
and its transitional year.
 We also take a short look at the recent earnings results reported by Spirit and WestJet. 
 Which reminds me. Were you aware that WestJet plans to acquire wide-bodied 767s — which it intends to use to 
fly to Hawaii? Didn't think so.
 Switching gears, last week we attended the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) conference out in Los 
Angeles. Just me and 6,000 of our closest friends.
 We'll give you the scoop on what the three major U.S airline CEOs — Richard Anderson, Doug Parker, and Jeff 
Smisek, had to say at the conference, along with a lot more.
 As for airline stocks last week, it was a bad week — just as it was for the markets in general. Goat of the Week 
honors went to shares of SkyWest. 
 All that — and more — this week in PlaneBusiness Banter. [2]

 Tourism Ireland has warmly welcomes the announcement by Ryanair of a new flight from Manchester to Shannon 
Airport this winter, which will help boost tourism to the west of Ireland from the all-important British market.
Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said: 'This announcement is more good news for tourism to the west of 
Ireland this year. We already work very closely with Ryanair and we look forward to co-operating with them to 
maximise the promotion of this new flight to Shannon.'
 Britain is the largest single market for tourism to the island of Ireland; last year, we welcomed approximately 3.8m 
British visitors, who contributed some €1.2bn in revenue to the economy.

 This is only slightly worse that the Ryan Air proposal for standing-only sections.
Oliver Wainwright, Airbus's folding saddle seat could be the cattle-class future for cheap flights[1]
 If you thought low-cost air travel couldn't get any more bleak, then Airbus has a treat in store for you. The 
aeroplane manufacturer has now filed a patent[2] for the what looks like a human battery-farm, but is in fact the 
future of budget flights: racks upon racks of folding saddle-seats for even more passengers to be jammed onto 
aeroplanes, packed in knee-to-rump.
 While some airlines have already removed their folding tray tables and squeezed leg-room down to brutal knee-
capping levels, Airbus have gone one step further, doing away with the idea of proper seating altogether. In their 
ultra-economy vision, seating aisles will instead take the form of long horizontal poles, from which bicycle-like 
saddles and small back and arm rests will pivot out, on to which humans will be placed, skewered together like 
table-football players.
 'The design of the seats has to be optimised so that they present the smallest possible bulk,' says Airbus, 
explaining that the saddle-style seat has been developed 'in order to reduce the distance needed to accommodate 
the legs of passengers between two rows of seating devices.'
 The result, according to the patent diagram, is what looks like a line of people doing a sit-down conga, perching on 
each other's knees. There barely a whisker of airspace between their limbs, let alone anywhere to place their over-
priced soggy sandwiches. And you can forget about having a nap, unless your neighbour has a particularly forgiving 
shoulder.
Here's the RyanAir 'vertical seating':

 Um, can you say back pain? 
Airbus has filed a patent[1] for a new "seating device" -- yes, device -- that would reduce bulk on aircraft. 
And while we all scoffed at Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary when he revealed plans for "vertical seats[2]" in 2010, the 
prospect of standing-room-only cabins is becoming a little more real. 
A study[3] released last week investigated the potential effects standing cabins would have on low-cost airlines. The 
study revealed that airlines could fit 21% more passengers and offer discounts of up to 44% if they added standing 
sections. 
So what would these standing seats look like? A peek at Airbus' patent design reveals a bicycle-esque seat, no 
backrest and no sign of tray tables or in-flight entertainment. Grand. 
"Reduced comfort remains tolerable for the passengers in as much as the flight lasts only one or a few hours," the 
Airbus patent states[4]. 'It is now no longer possible to further reduce the seating width, particularly in economy 
class... It is (also) difficult to continue to further reduce (the) distance between the seats because of the increase in 
the average size of the passengers.'
Alternatively, the SkyRider seat, which was revealed in 2010[5], appears to be a slightly more comfortable version 
of Airbus' design, with a full backrest and a saddle seat. The "perching seat design" could be used on short flights 
ranging from one to three hours, Wired[6] reported at the time.
Slimmer, lighter airplane seat models are already being swapped[7] into airplanes, making flights noticeably more 
crowded. 
But the big question remains: Would you book a "standing seat" if it meant a discount?

 London, United Kingdom, July 16, 2014 --(PR.com[1])-- The car park investment offers a fantastic entry opportunity 
for investors interested in growing their assets via an industry which is experiencing positive month-by-month 
growth trends.
Over 793,000 people travelled through Glasgow Airport in June 2014 ensuring it was able to record yet another 
month of growth.
Glasgow International Airport is currently undergoing no less than 15 projects over 12 months at a cost of £17 
million. Glasgow will have new and improved toilet facilities, revamp of departure areas and even a newly 
refurbished check-in area.
Further flight schedules are being added by the airline carrier Ryanair with potentially an additional 1 million new 
passengers flying from Glasgow International Airport each year.
John McGlynn, Airlink Group Founder said 'This was an extremely signi#64257;cant announcement today, Ryanair 
is the airline that genuinely grows the market. They are predicting 850,000 new passengers for Glasgow Airport and 
that's based on the winter schedule. Ryanair usually has a signi#64257;cantly busier summer schedule and this 
could mean well in excess of one million new passengers for Glasgow in 2015. Our Parksafe and Direct Parking 
sites have been full since the spring and we are well positioned with our strategic land bank to grow in line with the 
growth of Glasgow Airport. The airport team should be extremely proud of this deal as it is fantastic for everyone 
who lives and works in the West of Scotland.'
Francois Bourienne, commercial director at Glasgow Airport, said: 'June represented the start of the busy summer 
season and we were pleased to continue our trend of passenger of growth. Airlines responded to demand by 
adding extra capacity on popular routes and we also welcomed the launch of new services such as easyJet's direct 
#64258;ights to Split, Croatia. 'Our focus is now #64257;rmly on helping to deliver a successful Commonwealth 
Games. There are only 12 days to go until the opening ceremony and there is a real sense of excitement and 
anticipation building at the airport.'
Exciting New Car Park Investment Launched at Glasgow International Airport
Airport car parking is at a premium and has been a long-standing, high yielding corporate investment worldwide. 
FJP Investment is offering individual parking spaces from just £20,000 each.
'Our team is supporting the Park First investment, having seen the car parks already operational, this makes for a

BEAT AIRPORT LUGGAGE CHAOS BY SENDING YOUR HOLIDAY BAGS AHEAD

 LUGGAGE Mule, a luggage forwarding specialist, is urging travellers to beat the airport chaos and send their 
holiday baggage ahead of them to avoid delayed or missing bags as the UK's key airports struggle to cope with 
demand.
 Travellers' confidence in airlines and airports delivering their bags safely has plummeted as families prepare to 
getaway for their main summer holiday. In the past few weeks Heathrow saw a high-profile baggage system 
meltdown cause chaos for thousands and last weekend passengers at Gatwick experienced delays of 90 minutes 
whilst reclaiming bags. Jordan Makin, managing director of Rochdale-based Luggage Mule, said: 'The team has 
been inundated with calls and emails since Heathrow baggage systems went into meltdown. People are not 
prepared to risk their cases getting caught up in the mayhem and are looking for a different way of getting their 
cases to their destination efficiently.'
 Through Luggage Mule, bags of up to 30kg can be sent ahead via global courier UPS meaning travellers do not 
need to carry or check in their bags as they're sent straight to their holiday accommodation. Sending a 30kg case 
costs £29.99 each way with Luggage Mule - giving the customer an extra 10kg weight when compared to airline 
charges. Current price for easyJet hold luggage is £30 each way for a 20kg bag at check-in - this rises to £45 each 
way if a bag is deemed too large to take on as hand luggage at the boarding gate. A 20kg checked bag with 
Ryanair starts from £30 each way in low season, rising to £45 in peak season.
 Makin said: 'Sending your luggage ahead takes a little more planning than travelling with it, but our delivery 
success rate is 98.9%, higher than any airline. For families with a lot of luggage, this service is a godsend as it 
means they can travel with hand baggage only and get through airports at both ends quickly - plus they can pack 
more into suitcases as we take up to 30kg per bag rather an 20kg.
 'What the current baggage nightmare at Heathrow highlights is that travellers, especially families, are not prepared 
to risk their well-earned holiday being ruined by lost or delayed luggage.'

 It turns out that public profanity among top executives is sensitive to economic conditions, according to a 
Bloomberg News review of thousands of CEO calls with investors and analysts from 2004 to last month. It spiked in 
the aftermath of the recession in 2009 and has been decreasing as the recovery gathers steam over the last couple 
of years…A kind of periodic table of salty words — the F-bomb, the blasphemous GD, the scatalogical S and 
derogatory term AH — shows that they were used 254 times by top executives in calls during that decade. They 
appeared 17, 34, 197 and 6 times, respectively. To be sure, a majority of CEOs don't curse in public. In fact, three 
account for quite a bit of the graphic language. They are kind of a Cursing Hall of F. Hagedorn, along with Ryanair 
Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary and Emerson Electric Co. CEO David Farr are the only top 
executives to use the F-bomb more than once. Hagedorn used that word three times along with the other expletives 
for a total of 20 swear words. O'Leary followed with five F-bombs among 17 instances, and Farr with two Fs among 
10 total that were transcribed. [Bloomberg[1]]

 Manchester Airport is set for its busiest summer since 2007, as June 2014 saw over 2.2 million passengers 
travelling through the UK's 3rd largest airport.
 The figure represents a 5.8% increase year on year compared to June 2013, and demonstrates the airport's 
increasing popularity amongst passengers from the North of England.
 International passenger traffic was up 12% as families jetted off on early summer holidays - and takes the moving 
annual total up to 21.2 million.
 Ken O'Toole, chief commercial officer for MAG, owner of Manchester Airport, said: 'We continue to show consistent 
growth in passenger numbers and we are expecting one of our busiest summers for many years.
 "We expect that numbers will increase even further as the summer progresses, with increased numbers of 
business travellers and a busy summer holiday season ahead as schools finish.
 'There is still a great amount of untapped potential here at Manchester and we believe we still have lots more 
opportunities for growth, which is only good news for passengers and businesses in the North of England and 
beyond.
 "We continue to look to add more options for both business and leisure passengers, with increased frequency and 
new routes - and with more new exciting routes to come, we are on-track to reach our all-time peak of 22 million 
passengers, achieved in 2007.'
 During June, Ryanair celebrated flying its 11 millionth customer from Manchester; 20 years after the Irish company 
first began operating from Manchester a single route to Dublin. Ryanair have grown significantly over the last two 
decades and now offer low fare seats on flights to 36 different destinations across Europe.
 Air Canada Rouge, Air Canada's leisure carrier subsidiary, also commenced a brand new non-stop service from 
Manchester Airport to its hub, Toronto Pearson International Airport, in June, which operates five times per week.
 During the month, Jet2.com also announced twice weekly flights to Antalya and Malta and weekly flights to 
Kefalonia, beginning in May 2015.

 Germany's largest airline, Lufthansa, has said it will try to bolster profitability by investing more and extending its 
low-budget services. The announcement came a month after a 2014/2015 profit warning. In office for just two 
months, Lufthansa's new chief executive, Carsten Spohr, made it clear on Wednesday that his company was willing 
to take up the gauntlet from low-budget operators such as Ryanair and Emirates.
 As part of a new strategy to raise profitability, Lufthansa would not only focus on its no-frills subsidiary 
Germanwings, but would also call into being another low-budget airline for European routes under the Eurowings 
brand, Spohr said.
 He said the new subsidiary could start operating as early as next spring and would have up to 23 medium-range 
Airbus A320 jets.
 Leaner and cheaper
 But Spohr also mentioned plans to provide cheaper long-haul flights, most likely in cooperation with a foreign 
business partner.
 "Turkish Airlines is a potential partner for us, and our talks on the project have already reached an advanced state," 
the CEO said in a statement.
 Spohr added that a final decision was due in the fall of this year. Spohr has been under pressure to speed up the 
in-house restructuring process ever since he took office.
 A month ago he was forced to issue a profit warning for 2014 and 2015 as mounting international competition had 
made it harder for the German flagship carrier to secure bottom-line profit.

Norwegian 's Ridiculously Cheap London-To- U.S. Flights Take Off

 The time has come: budget airline Norwegian has launched its much-hyped, low-cost transatlantic flights. Here's 
everything you need to know. 
Norwegian announced its new cost-efficient flights last October[1]. The flights out of Gatwick Airport were promoted 
as affordable alternatives to the pricey seats on most UK to U.S. routes, and were set to take off in July. Right on 
schedule, the first ones took off from Gatwick Airport on July 3[2]. 
According to a Norwegian press release[3], almost all of the 291 seats on the airline's 787 Dreamliner have been 
booked on every inaugural flight between Gatwick and the three U.S. destinations -- New York, Fort Lauderdale and 
Los Angeles
Flights between London and Los Angeles will operate twice a week, with prices starting at £199 (about $340) one-
way. Flights between London and Fort Lauderdale will also operate twice a week and start at £179 (about $306) 
one-way. The thrice-weekly London-New York flights begin at £149 (about $255) one-way. 
According to Skyscanner[4], the cheapest flight from London to New York last month cost $718. Enough said. 
Sound too good to be true? According to The Guardian[5], the airline is offering far fewer super-budget seats than 
you might think. Last week, only four of those mythical £149 tickets could be found between July 2014 and March 
2015 (the furthest ahead that flights can be booked). The airline also charges £35 (about $60) each way for an 
"amenity package" including food and a checked bag. 
The Guardian also admits that pretty much every other flight out there is significantly more expensive, so 
Norwegian's cheaper base fares do pay off. 
And if the idea of flying budget across the Atlantic gives you back pain, don't fret. The Telegraph's Soo Kim 
experienced the flight firsthand and reports[6] that the flight was comfortable, with a user-friendly in-flight 
entertainment system and generally good service. 
Ryanair announced in February that it too has future plans[7] to launch transatlantic flights at just £10 ($17) one 
way -- but that won't occur until the airline acquires the necessary long-haul aircraft. Perhaps ultra low-cost flights 
will also be in the cards for the future of flying[8]. 
Norwegian was named the best value airline[9] in a May Skyscanner survey, coming out ahead of easyJet, British 
Airways and Ryanair. 
Congrats, Norwegian. Things are looking good for you!

 Deputy CEO Howard Millar at Ryanair Holdings Plc said he was leaving the biggest discount air carrier in Europe 
after over 22 years on the job because Michael O'Leary, the current CEO does not seems to be going any time 
soon.
 Millar, who is the CFO at Ryanair as well, will leave in December. Taking his place, as the CFO will by Neil 
Sorahan his deputy, said the carrier, which is based in Dublin.
Millar said he was the same age as the current CEO and does not think O'Leary will leave anytime soon. The 
deputy CEO said he did not want to regret letting an opportunity get away because he did not look for something 
else to do.
 Millar joined Ryanair in 1992 as the financial controller and in 1993 became the financial director. He took his 
current role in 2003 and helped the company with its IPO in 1997.
 O'Leary who was the deputy CEO at the time Millar joined Ryanair, moved into the top spot in 1994.
 Millar says he will target a senior role in another company and wants to one day become CEO though he does not 
have anything lined up as of yet.
 The deputy CEO said everyone wants to test themselves as its part of the natural progression.
 O'Leary said in a statement from Ryanair that his colleague was a pioneer in helping develop the sector of low-fare 
air travel and in particular in the area of commodity risk, aircraft financing, information technology and fuel 
management.
 When the current CEO has been questioned about his future at Ryanair he once said he would step down and 
suggested that his role would be less after the brand makeover that aimed to appeal to more families and business 
travelers.

 O'Leary has also said that he would like to see his work through to an end game in the transformation of short-haul 
travel in Europe. He predicts that will leave only Ryanair and a couple of other airlines standing.
 He also mentioned he would like to lead the introduction of low priced flight in the U.S.
 David Bonderman the Ryanair Chairman said in the company statement that Millar would become a member of the 
board as a non-executive member in 2015.

            http://fft.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/limerick.jpg German media will be touring Limerick.
 This weekend sees Limerick City and environs playing host to an influential group of German media, who are flying 
into Shannon Airport with Ryanair on their new access routes from Berlin and Memmingen.
These top German journalists, who write for leading newspapers and magazines, have an overall reach of 1.35 
million and the coverage that will be generated will add to the exposure for Limerick and the Wild Atlantic Way as a 
tourism destination.
 The visit has been organised by Fáilte Ireland in conjunction with Tourism Ireland, and includes a jam packed 
itinerary covering Limerick City's cultural programme including visits to the newly renovated King John's Castle and 
the Flying Boat Museum as well as trips to the surrounding villages of Adare and Foynes. The group will also spend 
a day in Clare travelling along some of the Wild Atlantic Way route stopping off at the Cliffs of Moher and Burren 
National Park.

 If you will be flying Ryanair[1] with a baby or toddler, or are considering whether or not to book with the budget 
European airline for your family's flight, here some important points that may really surprise you(!), especially if 
you'll be flying Ryanair with a child under 2 years.
 1. Ryanair only allows children under 2 years to occupy a seat for all portions of the flight when they are at least 1 
year old and are using the CARES flight safety harness[2] (details and full review or CARES here[3]). Otherwise, 
they must ride on an adult's lap during takeoff and landing.
 2. It is possible to purchase what they call an 'infant comfort seat,' eg. an extra seat for your child less than 2 years 
old to occupy during the cruise portion of the flight, but you can only make this reservation by phoning Ryanair's call 
center (find the number to call from your country here[4]).
 3. Ryanair charges a flat fare of 30€/30£ each way for a lap child.
 4. Ryanair does not allow car seats (child safety seats) to be used in its aircraft.
 5. Ryanair charges a fee to check your child's car seat, bassinet, or travel cot, which is 10€/10£ per item when paid 
online or 20€/20£ when paid at the airport.
 6. Ryanair will, thank goodness, let you gate-check your child's stroller (pushchair) free of charge.

Digital currency Bitcoin is increasingly accepted by some online travel agencies

 Alternative payment methods such as E-Wallets, online banking and mobile payment are on the rise, and the 
digital currency Bitcoin is also accepted by some online travel agencies.
One general trend in online travel is the increasing use of mobile devices to make reservations, especially by 
business travelers and consumers who book last minute trips. With the increasing use of smartphones and tablet 
computers for travel planning, payment methods have to adapt to the emerging trend in consumer practice. A third 
of airlines already plan to facilitate the use of mobile payments for booking purposes in the next two years. PayPal 
is already accepted by an increasing number of travel booking websites. 
Online payment fraud is a major concern of online travel agencies and booking websites. Though only around 1% 
of online travel payments is fraudulent, considering the size of the market, this is a significant number. Industry 
compliance with established safety regulations and keeping consumers informed about secure payment can 
contribute to decreasing the occurrence and cost of payment fraud. 
Another trend on the online travel payments is towards immediate payment at the time of booking of hotels. Though 
both prepayment and reservation held by card for later payment at the desk are present on such travel booking 
websites as Booking.com and Expedia.com, on other such as on Hotels.com pre-payment has become the 
dominant option.
Regional variations in online payment for flights and lodging
Though online travel is a global market, peculiarities of local payment environments influence travel payment 
practice. For example, budget airline Ryanair accepts direct debits on its website in Germany, where they are 
popular, and does not take surcharges on them. Online travel booking website Hotelurbano.com, for which the 
primary market is Brazil, accepts the local banking payment method Boleto Bancario, while Japan-based All Nippon 
Airways accepts cash payment at convenience stores, which is an accepted payment practice in Japan. US airline 
companies United Airlines and Delta Air Lines offer the delayed payment method Bill Me Later, a PayPal brand, for 
customers with a billing addresses in the USA.

 Budget airline operator Ryanair says its number of passengers grew by 300,000 in May, thanks partly to its 
introduction of a free piece of hand luggage on flights.
 The firm also announced a 3 point rise in its 'load factors' - the amount of passengers it can accommodate across 
its services.
 Ryanair's chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs said: "Ryanair traffic grew by 300,000 to 8.2m customers in May, 
thanks to the continuing success of our lower fares and our improving customer experience, including our great new 
website, allocated seating, a free 2ndsmall carry-on bag and PED (portable electric device) use on all flights.
 "Ryanair continues to deliver so much more than just the lowest fares for our 82.3 million customers.
 "We are especially pleased with the 3% point improvement in May load factor, which is slightly ahead of our 2% 
point growth target."

            http://www.planebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/home-typewriter-copy-1.jpgGood evening everyone! 
How was your Memorial Day weekend? Mine was spectacular! I hope you had a great start to summer as well.
 This week we have somewhat of a hodge podge in PlaneBusiness Banter[1].
 First, we have a great analysis this week by Brett Snyder, aka Cranky Flier[2]. This week Brett, who moonlights as 
a contributing editor for PlaneBusiness, looks at American Airlines and how it has been performing out of its home 
turf — DFW — over the last several years. In a nutshell — not well. But he dives into the data and tells us just how 
poorly. In addition, he stumbled upon a little nugget of information about Spirit and one particular American route 
that we think subscribers will find particularly interesting.
 Bottomline? There's a lot of opportunity here if American can get its act together. (And given the track record of the 
new management team at American, we're betting this is going to be the case.)
 We also talk a bit more this week about the situation in Dulles, and give you an extensive review of how the 
combined market looks out of DCA and IAD for both American/US Airways and United Airlines. Oh, there are lots of 
interesting things to look at here.
 Meanwhile, out in the Northwest, Delta Air Lines and Alaska Air Lines opened up yet another round of artillery fire 
last week with a series of announcements (within hours of each other) concerning new service out of Seattle.
 I'm not so sure how this story is going to end. But in the meantime, it's certainly interesting to watch.
 Delta and Travelport announced their new deal last week — the one that will see Delta taking control of its PSS 
development and management from Travelport. But Travelport will continue to host the system. I'll tell you why I 
think this is a good deal for both sides.
 Ryanair announced its fiscal year and fourth quarter earnings last week. While results were down, on a year-over-
year basis, analysts are apparently convinced that the airline will be successful in its easyJetrification process. 
Ahem.
 All this, and much, much, more, including a great week for airline stocks, in this week's issue of PlaneBusiness 
Banter. [3]

 The age of the toxic brand has dawned. This has ushered in an array of 'Marmite' brands and love them or hate 
them it doesn't matter - they're winning either way!
 The toxic companies are flourishing and no matter how many people despise them they keep on growing, fuelled 
by the horror stories we hear in the news.
 Take RYANAIR: People really do hate Ryanair: this February, for example, a mutiny was reported on one of their 
flights.
Despite being grounded for several hours, passengers were refused food and drinks by staff.
In the end, the customer service was so bad the passengers took matters in hand and called the police. 
lt;http://news.sky.com/story/1215664/ryanair-sorry-after-mutiny-on-delayed-flight
 Ryanair's image problem is neatly summarised by Google auto-complete:
 Although its not just mutinies and Google Michael O'Leary has to worry about. Last year the airline was voted the 
number one worst brand by Which? magazine.
According to their survey, which was taken by 3,300 people, this was down to the 'aggressive and hostile' way 
customers were treated, and the 'rude and unpleasant' staff.
 I doubt the hidden charges and extra costs wouldn't have helped either. According to the Mirror, lt;           
http://www.mirror.co.uk/money/city-news/ryanair-voted-worst-brand-britain-2283987gt; 'One traveller claimed to be 
happy to pay £50 extra on a rival airline 'to be treated like a human being!'
 In response to the survey, Ryanair fought back in its typically brash way:
 
 In a statement attached to the tweet they wrote, 'Which? hasn't got a clue about air travel but consumers actually 
do, because they're too busy booking Ryanair's low fare, on-time flights to waste time filling in Which magazine's 
tiny surveys.'
A terrible response of course, but they were right! You can be the most hated brand in Britain, but if you can give 
people offers they can't refuse, and be on-time, it doesn't matter.
Ryanair has been growing at an astounding rate in the last several years. Just look at their profits since 2009.
So you hate us? Who cares?
Despite reports this week that they've just experienced their first dip in five years, the company has predicted a 40 
per cent increase in passengers by 2019:            http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/19/ryanair-profits-
down-first-drop-5-years[1]
They are also outrunning their rivals EasyJet when it comes to the public's interest. Using Google Trends, you can 
see how much people have searched for each airline since 2004:
 From 2009 Ryanair have dominated the search engine battle and if you look further their lowest dips of interest are 
roughly the same as Easyjet's highest peaks.
Which all goes to show: being love is great, but being hated isn't as bad as you might think.
 What you need to avoid is people not caring at all. 'The opposite of life is not death,' said Elie Wiesel, 'it's 
indifference.'
As long as RyanAir stays cheap and on time, their toxicity is irrelevant.
 Public hatred for a brand isn't bad - it's publicity. Which means that no matter how entrenched in their image it 
becomes, Ryanair will continue to fly.
 Just don't expect them to hand out any free snacks as they do so.

 Europe's biggest low-budget carrier Ryanair has said fierce competition on the continent's hotly contested markets 
has resulted in lower full-year earnings. But the Irish airline is optimistic about 2014. Ryanair said Monday its fiscal 
year ending in March brought a bottom-line profit that was far lower than it had originally hoped for.
 Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in Dublin the no-frills carrier logged a full-year net profit of 523 million euros 
($716.7 billion), marking an 8-percent drop from the level reached a year earlier.
 He said cheaper tickets to attract more passengers had been behind the profit slump, alongside higher fuel costs. 
Ryanair's turnover increased to some 5 billion euros.
 The airline said it expected to hike earnings again in the current fiscal year, hoping for between 580 and 620 million 
euros in net earnings.
 From Europe to the US for a song?
 Ryanair also announced it would aim to become more attractive to business travelers. O'Leary said they'd make up 
35 percent of overall clients in the future, up from only 23 percent right now.
 O'Leary told the Sunday edition of Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper that his airline 
was planning to sell flights from Europe to the US for as little as 10 euros per ticket (not including fees).
 But the CEO made it clear that would only be possible in about five years' time when the purchase of long-range 
aircraft would become more affordable again.
 He reiterated the carrier's commitment to Germany's Frankfurt-Hahn airport, its most important base in the country. 
With its extra-long runway, the airport would lend itself perfectly to the use of bigger passenger planes as required 
for transatlantic flights, Ryanair stated.
 The airport at Hahn is located in the rural Hunsruck region, west of Frankfurt, in the state of Rhineland Palatinate.

 Saving fuel is a key concern for airlines, and one of the main reasons United and other carriers have switched over 
to lighter seats[1] on some aircraft.
 Those seats, made by Germany's Recaro, have the extra advantage of being thinner than conventional options, so 
rows can be closer together and more paying passengers can be packed onboard.
 Now, three young French guys have upped the ante with a seat that's nearly three times lighter than Recaro's.
 Benjamin Saada, Jean-Charles Samuelian, and Vincent Tejedor created Expliseat in 2011 and have now started 
selling it. Made from titanium and composites, it weighs just 4 kg (8.8 lbs). The Recaro seats used by United weigh 
11 kg.
 The difference is enough to cut fuel consumption to the tune of up to $400,000 per plane per year, the company 
says. If that's right, putting these seats on all 300 of Ryanair's 737-800 jets could save the budget airline about $120 
million a year.
 The seat, which consists of just 30 parts and is "pre-reclined" by 18 degrees, is designed for use in the Boeing 737 
and Airbus A320 family of aircraft. Those are the most popular planes for short- and medium-haul flights and 
represent a huge market potential.
 In March, the European Aviation Safety Agency approved the seat for commercial use. That same month, the 
startup signed its first customer. It will provide 220 seats for an A321 flown by charter airline Air Méditerranée, 
according to French newspaper LesEchos[2].

Apr 11, 2014 (Slugger O'Toole:http://www.sluggerotoole.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 There's a ton of good comment on Nuzhound re Michael D's state visit to the United Kingdom [makes a change 
from the single transferable column much in evidence at home this week - Ed]. It's hard to know what to leave out of 
John Spain's column for IrishCentral[1], so here goes:
 The plain people of Ireland, however, are far less impressed by all the hype about the visit. Judged by the reaction 
on newspaper websites and Twitter, they regard the whole thing as slightly comical and completely irrelevant to 
where we are at these days.
 'God save the Queen - she doesn't deserve this,' said one message writer, no doubt thinking of the tortuous waffle 
Michael D. will be inflicting on his host. 
 'A self-serving, self-regarding exercise in hubris and pomposity,' said another.
 'What a waste of taxpayers' money - couldn't he have gone Ryanair?' asked another. 
 'Will be avoiding the TV like the black death for the next 10 days - this s*** is truly nauseating in this day and age,' 
said another. 
 Avoiding the TV seemed like good advice. In case us ordinary folk might not grasp the importance of what was 
happening, RTE began the build-up before Higgins had even left on Monday afternoon. This included coverage of 
his departure from the Aras (his official residence) where he was seen off by a guard of honor and military band, 
followed by coverage of his departure speech at the airport, heavy with the significance and symbolism of what he 
was embarking on. 
 There was also a special interview for the six o'clock news on RTE. And all that before he had even left the 
country!
There's a very human reason for this. It's a state visit. That is, it's par for the general course, full of pomp, ceremony 
and circumstance. The precise circumstance being a President who not only frequently visits family in London, but 
used to live there.
 A far cry from the emotion of the Queens visit to the Republic three years ago which was charged with emotion of 
an old lady finally being warmly received - firstly by the Irish President in the former symbol of colonial power now 
transformed to a pinnacle of national sovereignty - and secondly by the vast majority of the Irish people.
 Including, as it happens, the very first Sinn Fein Mayor to meet a British sovereign, Michael Browne[2]. It did not 
endear him to his party until the day he died a few months later. 
 Spain continues:
Michael D and the Queen are just "what you need on occasions like this"
 The fact is that around a million Irish born people live in Britain and some of them have been there for decades. 
They have worked there, married there, raised children there and made lives there that were impossible 'at home' in 
Ireland. 
 So they don't need a lot of speeches and symbolic gestures to tell them about the special relationship that exists 
between the two islands. They've been living it for years. 
 They are also aware of the difficulties there have been. They've got through the uneasy times during The Troubles 
when the IRA was bombing British cities. 
 They know that even then the British kept the doors open and gave us free access when it would have been very 
easy for them to introduce restrictions. So in a very practical way they understand that there is a 'special 
relationship' between us. 
 The same applies, of course, to the people here at home, because with a million Irish in Britain there is not a family 
in Ireland that does not have connections there. To repeat, some of these connections go back decades. And we 
really don't need a state visit to Britain by the President to validate or give expression to these connections.
 That said, a formal state visit to Britain by an Irish president is a welcome development and it's long overdue. But it 
should be seen simply as a celebration of the positive ties between us rather than weighing it down with emotive 
blather about symbolism and great historical significance.
 He also notes the only thing the northern press seemed to notice the whole way through the four days:
 The most talked about aspect of the state visit was probably the decision by Martin McGuinness to accept the 
invitation from the Queen to Tuesday night's state dinner at Windsor Castle. That can't have been easy for him. But 
it was probably a lot harder for the Queen, since her favorite uncle Lord Mountbatten was blown up in Sligo by the 
IRA, which made it deeply personal.
 Of course, like McGuinness, a lot of Republicans had friends and relatives shot by the British Army. So it can't be 
easy for them either. 
 Many people here would question whether there is an equivalence of generosity involved, as Sinn Fein imply. But 
McGuinness has been remarkably consistent in his determination to put the past behind him and to move forward to 
build a new peaceful future for the North hand-in-hand with old enemies. Accepting the Queen's invitation to dinner 
is part of that. 
 Of course the Sinn Fein position on this also reflects the fact that they badly miscalculated when they snubbed the 
Queen's visit to Ireland three years ago. That visit was hugely popular here and Sinn Fein, which is trying to 
broaden their appeal to mainstream voters, doesn't want to be seen to be stuck in the past and mean in their 
approach.
 So they're not making that mistake this time. No doubt that was also a factor in McGuinness's conversion on the 
road to Windsor.
 And as a footnote:
 One final aspect of all this that is interesting is the difference it reveals between the Irish in Britain and the Irish in 
America. 
 For so many of the Irish in America, even those who went just a few decades back, they come to regard 
themselves as Americans relatively quickly. Irish Americans, of course, but Americans first. 
 The Irish in Britain never really become British, no matter how long they are there. This contrasts with Indian 
immigrants to the U.K., for example, who would be quite angry if anyone claimed they were not British.
 But the interesting thing is that although the Irish in Britain don't want to be British, that is completely accepted by 
the British.

 From a young age we are taught to be fast.
 As kids, we are rewarded for being the athlete with the greatest speed. At university, we are examined under time 
pressure. And in business life, CEOs incentivise and promote those senior executives who can get new ideas to 
market more quickly than competitors.
 But what if speed is the wrong measure for success?
 What if, instead of being fast, what matters is endurance - the ability to sustain competitive advantage longer and 
more dominantly than others?
 The art of endurance can be studied in some of the world's oldest companies, says HBR[1]. Take GKN, a British 
multinational on the FTSE 100 that makes auto parts and aero-space materials. The company has been around for 
over 250 years. It started life as an ironworks company, pursued vertical integration by entering coal, eventually 
moved into pressed steel wheels before diversifying into front wheel drive technology and beyond.
 Or take Harris Corporation, an American telecommunications company founded in 1895. At a time when some of 
the world's biggest newspaper companies are getting digitally disrupted, Harris exited the sector long ago but 
moved into adjacent industries. Having started out manufacturing printing presses it now focuses to high tech 
electronics and communications solutions, delivering over $5billion in annual revenue and 14,000 employees.
 The art of endurance is increasingly rare. Over the last 50 years, the average lifespan of SP 500 companies has 
shrunk from around 60 years to closer to 18 years. For each company that has lasted more than a century, there 
are countless more that have failed. Recall the glory days of Polaroid, Kodak, and the F. W. Woolworth Company - 
companies that were once the best in their field but failed to untangle themselves from deeply embedded routines, 
and fatally flawed resource allocation processes.
 If we rethink corporate success as survival in the face of rapid, globally competitive change, then here's the 
question: what does it take to sustain competitive advantage? What qualities of culture and individual leadership 
allow some companies to endure where others crumble under the pressure? To answer this question, I turned to 
the history books and extracted 4 lessons from those who have succeeded and failed.
Beware the dogma of founders. Edwin Land founded Polaroid in 1937. He was as famous for his visionary 
commitment to instant photography as he was for his autocratic style and dogmatic beliefs. Land deeply believed in 
Polaroid as a technology-led company committed to expensive, long-term technology projects. That makes him 
The Art of Corporate Endurance
sound like Google. But he was also zealously committed to the physical instant print and matching the quality of 
Polaroid prints with the 35mm product. His singular belief was both his greatest strength and weakness.
 Cultivate wasted time. There is an enormous gulf between ironworks and aerospace. Companies that survive build 
structures and systems that allow them to waste resources. The secret is to find safe structures to waste time and 
money. It seems paradoxical at first, but companies need slack resources to be efficient with capital allocation over 
the long term.
 In the early 2000s, IBM (founded in 1911) had an Emerging Business Opportunities process which identified and 
invested in a portfolio of growth opportunities. Many of these cannibalised existing revenues but were pursued 
regardless. IBM built special structures to ensure these businesses could succeed independently of the parent 
company, and without the residual effects of being associated with IBM's culture.
 Talk to your customers. Good product managers are in continuous conversation with their customers. But many 
senior executives lose touch with the humble customer as they get closer to the C-Suite.
 In a recent meeting I had with senior executives at a multinational retail bank, none of the top management team 
could remember the last time they had sat down with a randomly selected retail customer. It's crucial that decision 
makers who own budget are in touch with what customers think about the front-line product and user experience. If 
they aren't, they act in blind faith: a dangerous place to be.
 Don't just build competencies, build dynamic capabilities. A firm can buy competencies, but capabilities are harder 
to develop and are the key to sustaining competitive advantage. Take Southwest Airlines as an example. It has 
clear competencies in being able to turnaround aircraft quickly, and manage a low cost operating model. These 
competencies are hard to imitate, but they can ultimately be replicated with time and money. Other budget airlines 
like RyanAir and Easyjet offer similar competencies in Europe.
 Capabilities, by contrast, relate to structures and routines of decision-making at the most senior level of the 
organization. The rigor, culture and logic around these decisions are incredibly important, hard to develop, and 
almost impossible to change when they become dysfunctional. Enduring companies have dynamic capabilities. 
That means they have a culture of decision-making that is data-driven, customer-oriented, and adaptive to change.
 When we slow down and think about what it means to be successful, endurance may be a more prized possession 
than raw speed alone. Consider what it takes to be big in 100 years, not just 100 days.

13 Mistakes Study Abroad Students Make
13 Mistakes Study Abroad Students Make
The Huffington Post

Apr 02, 2014 (The Huffington Post:http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ Delivered by Newstex)
 Studying abroad is the first opportunity most young adults have to travel the world on their own. With all the 
excitement, it's easy to make some mistakes. 
 These 13 errors are totally common and very avoidable. Take our advice, and you'll have the best semester (or 
year) abroad. We promise. 
 1. Booking all your weekend trips in advance. 
One of the best parts of studying abroad is getting to explore nearby cities and countries. It's tempting to book your 
adventures in advance, but it's better to wait until you get there. Budget airlines and hostels are easy to book last 
minute and it's fun to fly by the seat of your pants. 
2. Not making a budget.
You need a weekly budget for meals, bars, transportation and random pastry shop excursions. You need a travel 
budget for all those weekend trips. You also need a souvenirs and gifts-for-everyone-else budget. Get budgeting. 
3. Not learning the language. 
Don't assume anyone speaks English. Learn some basics before you go and take a language course while you're 
there. You'll come back with a cool skill and you'll get a lot more respect from locals if you put some effort into 
communicating with them. 
4. Not living with a host family or local students. 
Living with a host family adds another dimension to studying abroad. You get a real glimpse of how locals live. If 
you can't live with a host family, living in a dorm with local students is the second-best thing. Hanging out with 
students from your home school or country is fun, and you should definitely have some, but you'll have a more 
immersive experience by bonding with locals.
 5. Zoning out during orientation. 
You've journeyed long and far to arrive at your destination and you're so excited to be there. So attending or paying 
attention to your program's orientation is probably the last thing you care about. But orientation can be chock full of 
nuggets of wisdom and information that you'll want to remember.
13 Mistakes Study Abroad Students Make
6. Buying an expensive international phone.
It makes sense to buy a local, pay-as-you-go phone for your time abroad. And you may think you need a 
smartphone, with a data plan and a camera and all that jazz. But honestly, you don't. It's a temporary phone and 
you could get pickpocketed, lose it, drop it... you're much better off getting a cheap phone to call and send texts and 
use your home cellphone on WiFi for everything else. 
7. Thinking local rules don't apply.
Just because something is done differently where you're from, doesn't mean you can throw local rules and socials 
norms by the wayside. "But I'm not from here" is not an excuse. You can and will get arrested abroad for breaking 
laws and you'll get lots of funny looks from locals if you blatantly challenge their cultural norms. Be yourself, but be 
cautious of the world around you. 
8. Traveling too much. 
It's great to check as many places off your bucket list as possible, but if you're traveling every single weekend and 
never have time to explore your host city, you're going to miss out on a lot of great stuff. Also, tearing through every 
city you visit in hopes of "seeing it all" is a great way to see nothing. Slow down, pick the things you really want to 
see and you'll have a much more memorable experience. 
9. Overdoing the partying. 
First off, if you're hungover all the time, it's hard to appreciate life abroad by day. Secondly, other cultures have 
different standards for what's an appropriate amount to drink and how to behave when under the influence. 
Stumbling around drunk in the streets will probably not give you a great reputation. Keep it classy. 
10. Not reading the fine print on your budget airline ticket. 
Pro tip: small budget airlines (*cough* Ryanair *cough*) are very different from larger airlines you're probably used 
to flying. You could incur hefty fees for everything from overweight baggage to not printing your ticket in advance. 
Do your research. 
11. Documenting every moment of your semester abroad. 
Taking pictures and updating social media is totally normal. But when you're consumed with making a million 
Facebook album, Instagramming every time you encounter WiFi and find yourself taking Snapchats and selfies 
every five minutes, you're gonna have a bad time. 
12. Flying into obscure airports because it's cheaper. 
It may seem like a good idea to fly into that random airport an hour outside Paris... but unless the ticket is way 
cheaper, it's not worth the small savings. You'll spend more time, effort and money getting to and from the airport 
and will be cutting into your precious weekend. 
13. Having FOMO over things happening at home.
Fear of missing out (aka FOMO) will inevitably occur when you think about all the fun things your friends back home 
are doing. Stop obsessively scrolling through Facebook and Skyping multiple times a day, and start living in the 
moment. Chances are you're having a lot more fun abroad than your friends are having at home.

 Travel price comparison website            www.dealchecker.co.uk is pleased to announce the launch of their very 
first mobile app. Known as 'Weigh-to-go,' this app enables travellers to check their baggage meets the weight limits 
set by an airline via a smart phone or mobile device, before they check-in. Perfect for avoiding excess baggage 
charges, this app is free to download from the dealchecker website, for more details or to download it now see            
www.dealchecker.co.uk or go to your app store. Mark Attwell, Managing Director at dealchecker comments 
'dealchecker is committed to helping travellers save money, in any way we can. We hope that with this innovative 
piece of technology passengers can now use their mobile phone as a sensitive set of luggage scales, helping 
dealchecker's save hundreds of pounds in excess luggage charges.'
 Baggage limits vary enormously between airlines. Ryanair has a hand baggage limit of 10kg and a standard check-
in bag can weigh up to 15kg. British Airways meanwhile allow weights of up to 23kg for both cabin bags and 
checked-in luggage. Excess baggage charges soon add up; easy JZet charges £11 per kg at the airport, whilst 
Flybe charges £10 per kg. This app is an essential tool in any cost-savvy traveller's mobile device. No more 
balancing suitcases on the bathroom scales, or waiting nervously to find out if you need to start re-distributing the 
weight in your bags, at the check-in desk for all to see. The app interface is easy to use. The user simply enters the 
airline name, places the phone or mobile device on the floor or a hard flat surface. Next place the bag on the phone 
or mobile device. After a few moments the easy-to-use interface will register the weights and advise whether the 
bag is over the specified weight limit or not. The app was developed in-house by dealchecker's skilled technical

 Fast Market Research recommends "Travel and Tourism in Morocco to 2017" from Timetric, now available
Boston, MA -- (SBWIRE[1]) -- 03/25/2014 -- The Moroccan travel and tourism sector registered slow growth during 
the review period (2008-2012), due to the European sovereign debt crisis and the Arab Spring uprisings in 2010. 
Government initiatives on domestic and international tourism promotions, the development of tourism infrastructure 
and increased government investments will develop the tourism sector over the forecast period (2013-2017).
Report Highlights
In June 2013, the Ministry of Tourism launched the new edition of the Kounouz Biladi program to promote domestic 
tourism. Kounouz Biladi targets middle-class families who do not allocate budgets for trips. The ministry announced 
appealing prices and travel agencies provided attractive packages similar to those offered to international tourists 
during the 2012 edition of the program. The ministry also announced that Kounouz Biladi will be extended to other 
seasons to enable domestic tourists to benefit from discounts throughout the year.

In July 2013, the tourism board increased its focus on countries such as China, Russia, Eastern Europe, North 
America and the Middle East to promote Morocco as an attractive tourist destination. The Moroccan National 
Tourist Office has already set up offices in Beijing and launched a promotion plan aiming to attract Chinese tourists. 
The office has also requested airlines in both Morocco and China to fly direct flights between the two countries.
In June 2013, Royal Air Maroc announced that it will purchase 20 to 30 new aircraft by 2020, including five long-
haul aircraft. British Airways had increased the number of flights from seven to 10 between November 2012 to 
March 2013 between Marrakech and London. In April 2013, Ryanair has also renewed its long-term interest in the 
country by adding two bases in Marrakesh and Fez, increasing its Moroccan operations to 60 routes and eight 
airports, transporting 2.5 million passengers a year to the country.
Premium and high-end luxury hotel brands, such as Mandarin Oriental, Oberoi, The Address Hotels, Rocco Forte 
Collection and Kempinski, have started investing in new properties in the country; 54 hotel projects are planned with 
Travel and Tourism in Morocco to 2017 - New Report Available
a total of 15,000 new guest rooms. Among these, 18 five-star hotels will be built in Marrakech. Kempinski is also 
planning two new properties in the country. The Royal Palace hotel, with 260 rooms, opened in Agadir in March 
2013, and in October 2013, the 270-room Al Houara hotel opened in Tanger.
The cost of renting a basic car with no restrictions on travel distance starts from MAD3,408.2 (US$395.0) per week 
or MAD491.8 (US$57.0) per day. This is very expensive for a North African country. Most car rental companies also 
demand a refundable cash deposit of MAD2,934.7 (US$340.0) or MAD4,875.0 (US$565.0) if not paid by a credit 
card. The best cities to hire cars in are Casablanca, Marrakesh and Tangier, where cars are available at 
competitive prices.
