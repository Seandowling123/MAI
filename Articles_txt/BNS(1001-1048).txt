The Irish budget airline said it was also starting new routes from its Frankfurt Hahn base to Fez and Marrakesh in 
Morocco, Granada and Murcia in Spain, Trieste and Verona in Italy, and Krakow and Wroclaw in Poland.
It expects that the new routes will bring an additional million passengers per year.
The new route will take the number of routes Ryanair operates from Kaunas to five. It now offers flights to London 
and Stockholm and is starting a new route to Dublin on Apr. 29.
The airline has carried over 60,000 passengers to and from Lithuania since the launch of its first route from Kaunas

Irish budget carrier Ryanair, which opened routes from Kaunas Airport last year, may offer flights from Kaunas to 
the Frankfurt-Hahn Airport in Germany.
That option was being considered, said Gediminas Miskinis, the secretary of state at the Ministry of Economy.
"This is our wish and their possibilities. Ryanair is the undoubted leader at that airport, it has made investments 
there. Moreover, these could be combined flights, including the carriage of passengers by bas from the Kaunas 
Airport to Birstonas, Druskininkai or other towns, or from Hahn Airport to Brussels," Miskinis added.
He discussed the outlook for a direct route between Kaunas and Hahn Airports during his visit to Germany last 
week.
At present Ryanair offers flights from Kaunas to London and Stockholmd. Late in April, it will open a regular route to 
Dublin. The company carried over 56,000 passengers in six months of business in Kaunas.

Irish no-frill carrier Ryanair has carried 56,000 passengers on its Kaunas-London route in six months of operations 
in Lithuania, the Lietuvos Rytas daily reports.
"We are satisfied with the performance of this route," said Lotta Lindquist-Brosjo, Ryanair's Nordic and Baltic Sales 
and Marketing Manager.
The company expected to carry 100,000 passengers within a year. The number of travellers should increase in 
summer, thus the actual number of passengers will far exceed the projections.
The load factor at Boeing 737-800 planes operating on the route stood at 83 percent, same as the average load 
factor for the company.
Ryanair would carry over 200,000 passengers on its route to Kaunas in the following business year, Lindquist-

With Ireland's Ryanair and Hungary's Wizz Air planning new routes from Lithuania's second-biggest city, Kaunas 
Airport expects a fourfold increase in passenger numbers to 300,000 this year and looks to attract more, smaller air 
carriers in the future.
Kaunas Airport director Kestutis Cucenas said that the airport was in talks with small Swedish and Norwegian 
budget airlines but did not name them.
With the arrival of Ryanair and Wizz Air, passenger traffic at Kaunas Airport reached around 80,000 last year, a 
fourfold rise from 2004.
"We anticipate growth in passenger numbers this year because the Irish and Hungarian low-cost airlines are adding 
new destinations to their flight schedules," Cucenas said.
Kaunas Airport plans to build a 4,000-square-meter terminal, estimated to cost 10-12 million litas (EUR 2.9-3.5 
mln), to comply with the Schengen requirements and remain open to travelers from non-Schengen countries after 
the country joins the free movement area.

 Hungary's budget airline Wizz Air is launching flights from Kaunas, Lithuania's second-biggest city, on Friday,

 Wizz Air is the second low-cost air carrier to operate flights from Kaunas Airport.

 Depending on demand, Wizz Air will also consider starting direct flights from Kaunas to Britain, Germany and 
Ireland.
 Kazmer said the average ticket price on the routes offered by Wizz Air was 50 euros.

 The interest in flights offered by Irish no-frill carrier Ryanair from Kaunas, the second largest Lithuania's city, has 
exceeded the most optimistic forecasts made at the company's entry into Lithuania's market.
 "The load factor at Ryanair flights averages at 90 percent.
The representatives of the Irish company have told us that the flights to from Kaunas and back would justify 
themselves with the occupancy rate at approximately 75 percent, which is largely what we had expected," said 
Kestutis Cucenas, CEO of Kaunas Airport.
 The structure of passengers, however, was different from Latvia, which Ryanair entered before Lithuania, he noted.
 "While assessing the experience of Riga we projected that the flights to Kaunas would be of interest to the Brits 
who comprise the major share of Ryanair passengers to Riga. However, the Lithuanians seem to be interested in 
the flights the most" Cucenas said.
 Ryanair opened flights from and to Kaunas late in September with a single route to London. In future the company 
may also add routes to Frankfurt, Dublin and Glasgow.
 Meanwhile, Hungary's no-friller Wizz Air will launch flights from Kaunas to Warsaw, and, from the latter city, to 
Paris, Liverpool, Dortmund, Malme-Copenhagen, London and Stockholm from Dec. 1.
 Moreover, Wizz Air is mulling a possibility to offer direct flights to Germany and Ireland from Kaunas.
 Last year the Kaunas Airport posted the losses of approximately 1 million litas (EUR 0.29 mln).
 The airport, which has the design capacities of 500,000 passengers per year, expects to service some 300,000 
passengers in 2006.

 Ireland's budget airline Ryanair, which opened a route to Lithuania in September, has canceled three flights 
between Kaunas and London, the daily Kauno Diena reported.
 It is believed that Ryanair's flights, scheduled for last Saturday, this Friday and Sunday, were cancelled because of 
aircraft delivery delays caused by a strike at Boeing last month.
The director of Kaunas Airport, Kestutis Cucenas, said he did not know the reason for the cancellation of flights, but 
it was definitely not a lack of passengers.
 "Passenger numbers exceed expectation.  About 90 percent of seats are filled on this route, which is a very high 
rate," he said.
 Ryanair warned in September that it would cancel approximately 200 flights in October due to delays in the delivery 
of seven aircraft.

 Irish budget carrier Ryanair, which is due to launch flights from the Lithuanian airport in Kaunas on Sept. 22, has 
secured 7,000 bookings for the first month of its flights to London.
 "We are very pleased with the development of the route.
The Lithuanians seems very eager to visit London and the British seems curiously interested about Kaunas and 
Lithuania. For the first month of flying we have already had more than 7 000 bookings on the route", Karl 
Hogstadius, Ryanair deputy manager for Nordic and Baltic regions, has said in a press release.
 The carrier was pleased with great interest in low-fare flights in Lithuania, he added. The route will have one daily 
departure from Kaunas and will be operated with brand new Boeing 737-800 aircrafts.
 In future Ryanair may offer flights from Kaunas to Frankfurt, Dublin and Glasgo, with final decisions over this routes 
still pending.
 On Dec. 1 Hungary's no-frill carrier Wizz Air will offer flights from Kaunas to Warsaw, as well as routes to Paris, 
Liverpool, Dortmund, Malme-Copenhagen, London and Stockholm, all via Warsaw.
 Previously the Kaunas airport mostly focused on cargo carriers.
 The airport, which operates a 3.25 kilometer long runway and may service any type of aircraft, posted a loss of 
about 1 million litas (EUR 0.29 mln) for 2004.

 Wizz Air, the largest budget carrier in Central and Eastern Europe, has announced its intentions to kick off flights 
from Kaunas to Warsaw from Dec. 1.
 No-friller will also offer flights to Paris, Liverpool, Dortmund, Malme-Copenhagen, London and Stockholm via 
Warsaw.
Wizz Air is the second budget carrier to launch cheap flights from Kaunas as Irish Ryanair will kick off flights from 
the second largest Lithuania's city to London on Sept. 22.
 "The company will offer Lithuania's and Poland's people convenient travel at reasonable prices. This step proves 
our determination to expand the geography of our flights in the eastern direction," said Jozsef Varadi, Wizz Air 
CEO.
 Kestutis Cucenas, acting CEO of Kaunas Airport, has said that the decision of Wizz Air to offer flights from Kaunas 
was a yet another step towards the transformation of the airport into a no-frill hub in Lithuania.
 Wizz Air, which launched its business in May 2004, has already serviced 1.5 million passengers and has taken the 
lead on the fast-growing low-cost air travel market in Poland and Hungary, the company has said.
The carrier will offer six weekly flights from Kaunas to Warsaw. One-way tickets, excluding taxes and feex, will cost 
from 9.99 euros and 19.99 euros. Reservations are available at the company's Website at www.wizzair.com. 
 Wizz Air operates a fleet of new Airbus A320s. This summer the company operates 32 routes between 17 
European air hubs.

 The city of Kaunas has signed a contract with Airport Marketing Services, the administrator of Ryanair's Internet 
site, on advertising of the Irish budget airline's first service between Kaunas and London, scheduled to start in the 
autumn.
 The municipality of Kaunas said that it will share the advertising costs, amounting to 105,000 euros per year, with 
other institutions that took part in the negotiations with Ryanair -- the Lithuanian Transport Ministry, the municipality 
of Vilnius and the State Tourism Department.
Ryanair's Internet site attracts an average of 200 million visitors monthly, according to the press release.
 The Irish low cost airline plans to begin daily flights from Kaunas Airport to London's Stansted Airport on Sept. 22.
 It may also offer flights from Kaunas to Frankfurt, Dublin and Glasgow in the future, but decisions on these routes 
have not been taken yet.
 Kaunas Airport, which has a 3.25-kilometer-long runway that can accommodate any type of passenger aircraft, 
now mainly serves cargo flights and operates at a loss. Expanding this airport would be cheaper than building a 
new one.
 Vilnius Airport, which accounted for 90.6 percent of all passenger traffic at Lithuanian airports and 70 percent of all 
flights last year, has limited possibilities for expansion.

 Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair will kick off business in Lithuania in September with the opening of a route to London.
 The costs of Ryanair flights to the local authority of Kaunas, the second-largest Lithuania's city, will exceed 
350,000 litas (EUR 101,449) per year.
Flights from Kaunas to London would depart on a daily basis starting from Sept. 22, Karl Hogstadius, deputy of 
Ryanair executive for the Nordic and Baltic region, said at Tuesday's news conference.
 Passengers would be flown to London Standsted airport located at a distance of some 50 kilometers from the 
British capital, he added. The tickets would cost some 30-40 euros (LTL 103.6-138), airport fees inclusive.
 Tickets to Ryanair flights will only be available over the Internet.
 Ryanair expected to carry some 100,000 passengers on its new route per year, Hogstadius noted.
 In future Ryanair may also offer flights from Kaunas to Frankfurt, Dublin and Glasgow, however, the decisions 
concerning those routes had not been made as yet, he added.
 Arvydas Garbaravicius, the Kaunas mayor, said at the news conference that the local authority of Kaunas would 
pay the Irish company 105,000 euros (LTL 362,500) per year for the advertising of the route Kaunas-London on the

 Ryanair, the Irish budget airline, promised on Friday to give a final answer on whether it intends to start flights to 
Kaunas Airport in Lithuania within a month, officials said.
 If Ryanair's answer is positive, a service to Kaunas could be introduced in October.
"Ryanair promised to give us a definite answer as to whether they see possibilities for starting flights from Kaunas 
Airport in around a month's time, after the company's board has discussed this issue," Valdemaras Salauskas, the 
Transport Ministry secretary, told reporters after Friday's meeting with Ryanair's representatives.
 The official said Ryanair is satisfied with all the technical conditions at the airport. He added, however, that the 
problem of "marketing money" remains to be solved.
 "Information that there is a service to Lithuania and booking information would be made available on Ryanair's 
website. The company sees it as a marketing tool and wants the country to cover these costs," Salauskas said.
 He did not say what amount of money the parties are negotiating for.
 Reportedly, last year Ryanair asked Lithuania to pay up to a million litas (EUR 0.29 mln) per year for Internet 
tourism advertising.
 There are currently no low-fare airlines operating in the country.
 Earlier this year, the Transport Ministry invited eight European low-fare airlines to introduce flights to Kaunas. Air 
Berlin, German Wings and Belgium's Hapag Lloyds Express also responded to the ministry's letter, but only to 
inform it that they had no immediate plans to expand to Lithuania.

 Lithuania intends to invite Ryanair to start low-cost flights in and out of Kaunas Airport this fall, the Transport 
Ministry said.
 A delegation from the Irish budget airline, headed by Benny Berger, director of the new flights development 
department, is to arrive in Lithuania on Friday.
The Transport Ministry said in a statement that all institutions participating in the talks with Ryanair -- Kaunas 
Airport, the municipalities of Vilnius and Kaunas, the Kaunas county administration and the State Tourism 
Department -- agreed on a joint negotiating position on Wednesday.
 The Lithuanian side is waiting for concrete proposals as to the start of flights from Ryanair and expects that the 
airline will introduce at least one daily service by the end of this year, according to the statement.
 Valdemaras Sulauskas, the Transport Ministry secretary, said that the municipalities of Vilnius and Kaunas intend 
to help attract the low-fare carrier to Lithuania by developing the necessary infrastructure and organizing regular 
public transport services to the airport, which is located in Karmelava, not far from Kaunas.
 There are currently no low-fare airlines operating in the country.
 Last fall Ryanair expressed interest in starting flights in and out of the country in 2005. The airline planned to carry 
200,000 passengers a year.
 Earlier this year, the Transport Ministry invited eight budget airlines to introduce flights to Kaunas, but Ryanair was 
the only to respond to this invitation.
 Kaunas Airport posted a loss of almost 1 million litas (EUR 0.29 mln) last year, compared with a net profit of around 
300,000 litas in 2003, according to information available to BNS.

 Ireland's Ryanair is the only among eight discount budget airliners to have responded to the Lithuanian Transport 
Ministry's invitation to begin services to the country so far.
 Vidmantas Kairys, director of the Civil Aviation Department at the Transport Ministry, told BNS that Ryanair had 
offered to continue talks over the terms and conditions for a possible service to Lithuania.
Transport Minister Zigmantas Balcytis also sent letters to Britain's EasyJet and BMI-baby; Germany's Air Berlin, 
Virgin Express and GermanWings; Belgium's Hapag Lloyd Express, and Dutch FLYbe.
 The minister said in his letters that the best place to begin operations in Lithuania would be the airport in Kaunas, 
the country's second-largest city, which has a 3.25-kilometer-long runway and can accommodate any type of 
passenger aircraft.
 Currently, no low-fare air carriers operate in Lithuania.
 Ryanair had earlier expressed its interest in operating flights in and out of Lithuania but its talks with local officials 
failed after it asked that Lithuania pay it up to a million litas (EUR 0.29 mln) per year for advertising the country's 
tourism institutions on its Internet site.
 Passenger traffic at Lithuanian airports surged by 39.3 percent to 1.097 million and aircraft movements increased 
by 21.3 percent to 33,760 last year.
 The international airport in the capital of Vilnius accounted for 90.6 percent of total passenger numbers and 70 
percent of all flights.

 Zigmantas Balcytis, Lithuania's minister of transportation, has invited eight leading European budget carriers to try 
out Lithuania's air travel market.
 Minister sent respective invitations to Ireland's Ryanair, British easyJet and BMI baby, Germany's Air Berlin, Virgin 
Express and German Wings, Belgium-registered Hapag Lloyd Express and Dutch FLY be.
In particular, the ministry urged no-frill carriers to assess the advantages of Kaunas Airport, which operated a 3.25-
kilometer long runway and was adapted for aircraft of any type.
 So far, budget carriers tended to omit Lithuania in their expansion schedules. Ryanair appeared the budget carrier 
only to be interested in the market, however, the company demanded that domestic authorities provided it with 
numerous advantages, which some high-ranking public officers dismissed as hidden subsidies.
 Meanwhile, Balcytis highlighted the impressive growth of Lithuania's economy in his invitation letters, and added 
that a continuing rise in population income and membership in the European Union (EU) boosted the potential of 
the market considerably.
 "Passenger flow handled by air carriers surged by almost 40 percent last year. We hope that the growth of that 
market in Lithuania will far exceed European average in the next several years to come. That is why I urge you to 
consider the inclusion of Lithuania into the future list of prospective new routes," minister said in the invitation letter.
 Lithuania's airports serviced 1.097 million passengers in 2004, a rise of 39.3 percent from the year-earlier figure of 
788,100. The number of flights handled by airports soared by 21.3 percent, year-on-year, to 33,760.

 Despite the wishes of Irish budget carrier Ryanair to get up to 1 million litas (EUR 0.29 mln) per year for flights to 
Lithuania, the national authorities still hope to lure this or another no-frill carrier to the country.
 The Ministry of Transportation would shortly invite all major foreign budget carriers to consider business in 
Lithuania, Valdemaras Salauskas, ministry's secretary, said after Tuesday consultations at the ministry.
"We will point out that Lithuania may offer favorable business environment, a rather strong passenger flow and 
growing economy," Salauskas noted.
 He admitted that Ryanair had been the sole no-frill carrier showing any interest in operations on Lithuania's market. 
The study by ASI Consulting Baltic had revealed that Kaunas Airport might be the most advantageous for low-cost 
flights.
 "We are interested in low-cost flights to Germany, UK and Scandinavia", Salauskas said.
 In late 2004 Ryanair submitted to Lithuania's authorities a marketing proposal stating that the company wished to 
get up to 1 million litas per year for flights to and from Lithuania alongside low airport rates and other favorable 
conditions. Some public officers dismissed such demands as subsidising of flights via huge payments for links to 
Lithuania on Ryanair's website.
 Salauskas admitted that the authorities would have to earmark funds for proper arrangement of infrastructure 
required for no-frill carriers.
 Last year Lithuania's airports serviced 1.097 million passengers, a rise of 39.3 percent from the year-earlier figure. 
The number of flights surged by 21.3 percent, year-on-year, to 33,760.

 Apart low airport rates and other favorable conditions, Irish budget carrier Ryanair is eager to get up to 1 million 
litas (EUR 0.29 mln) per year from Lithuania for flights to and from the country.
 The Irish company put forward a proposal to effectively subsidise its flights via huge payments for links to Lithuania 
on Ryanair's website.
"I would say that it is pure subsidising, which is contrary to competition and distorts the market. This is not tolerated 
by the European Commission (EC), either, said Rima Jakyte, head of Information, Analysis and Control unit of 
Lithuania's State Tourism Department.
 In mid-December Ryanair proposed to the State Tourism Department to pay 200,000 euros per month, or 8.287 
million litas per year for a link to the department on Ryanair's website.
 The department rejected the price, which equalled its annual budget.
 Meanwhile, Ryanair offered to maintain a link to the department's website on its secondary web page for 17,600 
euros per month, or 211,200 euros per year.
 Proposals to the State Tourism Department were handed over by Benny Berger, Ryanair new route development 
director.
 "Correspondence was broken before Christmas as they understood that we would not pay that price," Jakyte told 
BNS.
 Lithuania has so far failed to attract any no-frill carrier. Ryanair has opted for Riga airport as its Baltic hub.

 Irish budget carrier Ryanair, well-settled at Riga airport, is no longer eyeing Lithuania's no-frill market, dominated 
by airBaltic, the Verslo Zinios business daily has reported on Thursday.
 Managers of Kaunas airport, who held talks with Ryanair, failed to lure the carrier even with 50 percent discount 
tariffs.
Talks with Ryanair had been complicated, said Rimantas Skridaila, Kauno Aerouostas CEO.
 "In the beginning Ryanair laid down additional conditions and voiced discontent with proposals. We made certain 
concessions and offered the terms of cooperation equal to Riga or even better, however, we discovered that they 
only wanted to maintain pressure on the market. In effect, Lithuania's market is too small for them," Skridaila noted.
 Valdemaras Salauskas, secretary of the ministry of transportation, told the daily that Ryanair apparently did not 
wish to compete with airBaltic over a small passenger flow.
 "The majority of Lithuanians travel with Ryanair from Riga airport as the distance of some 100 kilometers is not 
significant. Most probably the results of market survey showed them that there is no point to expand in the 
neighborhood," he added.

 The airport in Lithuania's second-biggest city of Kaunas is set to become a hub for low-cost airlines, a Transport 
Ministry official said on Friday.
 "The ministry's position is that the Kaunas airport should negotiate with all low fares airlines and apply the same 
pricing policy to all of them," Valdemaras Salauskas, the Transport Ministry secretary, told BNS.
"As far as we know, (the airport) has received proposals only from the Irish discount airline Ryanair so far," he said.
 Salauskas was speaking after Friday's meeting with the airport's managers, who presented their positions in future 
negotiations with low-cost airlines to the ministry's officials.
 It was stated during the meeting that there were no obstacles for budget airlines to operate flights from the Kaunas 
airport.
 Salauskas also said that the airports in the capital of Vilnius and the seaside resort of Palanga were likely to revise 
down their fees too, but not enough to satisfy low-cost carriers.
 Ryanair said in early October that it was looking to introduce flights to Lithuania in 2005.
 The airline's representatives said during their visit to Lithuania that Ryanair intended to begin services from the 
Kaunas airport in September 2005 and planned to carry up to 200,000 passengers per year.
 Ryanair would fly passengers from Kaunas to five European destinations: London, Stockholm, Tampere, Rome, 
Milan, Frankfurt and Hamburg.

 Ryanair, the Irish budget airline, wants to start flights from Lithuania's second-biggest city of Kaunas to seven 
European destinations within a year.
 Berner Berger, a senior executive at Ryanair, discussed the possibility of launching services from Kaunas' 
Karmelava International Airport with Mayor Arturas Zuokas of Vilnius and Deputy Mayor Erikas Tamasauskas of 
Kaunas during their meeting in Lithuania's capital on Friday.
"We are only discussing it at the moment, but we would really start flights if the airports lowered their charges," 
Berger said after the meeting.
 Now less than a million people travel to Lithuania by air annually, but Berger said the arrival of low-fares airlines in 
the market could help boost the traffic up to 5 million people.
 Zuokas said that Vilnius welcomed Ryanair's plans to start flights from the strategically well-positioned Karmelava 
airport and would not compete with Kaunas in attracting the budget airline.
 "We are going to call on the Cabinet and the Transport Ministry to reduce airport charges in the near future," he 
said.
 Tamasauskas, the deputy mayor of Kaunas, said that a road from the Kaunas-Vilnius highway to Karmelava to 
would have to be built if Ryanair began flights from the airport. He added that the airport's passenger terminal would 
need upgrading as well.
 Ryanair would fly passengers from Kaunas to London, Stockholm, Tampere, Rome, Milan, Frankfurt and Hamburg.
 It has been reported earlier that the Irish air carrier would pay around 1,700 litas (EUR 493) to the Kaunas airport 
per flight, which is at least five times less than the airport charges for its services now.

have chosen the neighboring countries for route expansion into the Baltics, the business daily Verslo Zinios 
reported on Friday.
 But the tourism industry remains hopeful that someday the low cost operators will be able to overcome the 
opposition from Lithuanian authorities, which are protecting the interests of the national air carrier Lietuvos 
Avialinijos (Lithuanian Airlines), and begin services from the Vilnius airport.
 Britain's low cost airline easyJet announced this week that it is due to start services from Estonia and Latvia. It is to 
open a new route from Tallinn to London in late October and begin flying from Tallinn and Riga to Berlin in 
November.
Its bigger rival, Ireland's Ryanair, announced in July that it is to start flying from Riga to three destinations -- 
London, Frankfurt and Tampere -- on Oct. 31.
 Both easyJet and Ryanair are interested in starting services from Vilnius as well, but their say that the airport taxes 
are too high for them. The airports in Riga and Tallinn had to reduce their airport and passenger charges to attract 
Europe's leading low fares airlines.
 "We are interested in the Vilnius airport, but it is too expensive and does nothing to lower costs. The airport risks 
being left behind (by its competitors)," the paper quoted Toby Nicol, corporate communications manager at easyJet, 
as saying.
LITHUANIA STANDS TO LOSE TOURISTS AS LOW COST AIRLINES CHOOSE NEIGHBORS -- REPORT
 "If the low cost airlines abandon their intentions (to run flights from Vilnius) altogether, we stand to lose five to 
seven percent of tourists, and even more in the future," said Kestutis Ambrozaitis, president of the Lithuanian 
Tourism Association.
 He said Lithuania would loose 50,000 to 100,000 tourists per year, which would lead to the industry losing at least 
33 million to 75 million litas in revenues annually.

 The Irish budget airline Ryanair, which last year came to Estonia to test the ground, did not show clear interest in 
launching operation in this Baltic state, a senior Economy and Communications Ministry official says.
 "The ministry waited for Ryanair to make a concrete offer to launch flights from the Parnu airport," head of the 
economic development department Ahti Kuningas told BNS on Wednesday. "Talks could have been opened after 
the firm made its interest clear."
Ryanair should also have indicated which obligations it was ready to assume, Kuningas said. "Principles of fair 
competition do not admit of the state going to a concrete company with an offer," he said. "There are many such 
companies and as a rule their demands are such that they are hard to comply with."
 As Kuningas sees it, Ryanair is seeking an infrastructure in which it need not itself invest and low airport fees. "We 
proposed a meeting, but they did not wish to get together. Probably what Estonia has to offer at the present is of no 
interest to them."
 The no-frills airline announced on Tuesday plans to launch at the end of October flights from the Latvian capital 
Riga to London, Frankfurt and Tampere.
 "The Tallinn airport asks from carriers a fee of 15 euros per each outgoing passenger, plus aircraft landing and 
parking charges," Kuningas said. "At the same time the budget airline Volare operating on the Tallinn-Milan route, 
for example, pays just as high airport fees as Estonian Air."
 So far it has not been considered possible to lower airport fees in Tallinn, because the airport has made big 
investments and the company has a heavy loan burden. The airport's loan payments including interest are about 50 
million kroons (EUR 3.19 mln) a year. All told, the firm has loan commitments totaling around 300 million kroons.

 The Tallinn airport is holding talks with the budget airline Easyjet over launching flights, marketing director Eduard 
Tuur says.
 "If we were to meet them halfway, we'd have to lower airport fees for all carriers," Tuur told the daily Postimees.
"One option to do it would be to lower fees outside rush hours."
 The Riga airport, from which another well-known no-frills airline, the Irish Ryanair, will begin operating flights soon, 
is also in negotiations with Easyjet.
 Ahti Kuningas, head of the Economy Ministry's economic development department, said an important factor for 
airports to operate profitably and earn a profit is the size of population of the corresponding region, in which Riga 
unfortunately has a clear advantage over Tallinn.
 "On the other hand, the price policy is not the only criterion in attracting airlines to a region, frequently the quality of 
service and for example investments in airport security matter more, but they in turn play a role in the pricing 
policy," Kuningas said. "Estonia has so far made efforts to ensure that the airport is safe for clients, clean and 
meeting all requirements, hence the price policy of our airport."
 Ryanair announced on Tuesday it would at the end of October launch flights from Riga to London, Frankfurt and 
Tampere. The firm has also opened a Latvian-language Web site.

 Estonia's national carrier Estonian Air perceives no direct competition in the Irish budget airline Ryanair's 
expansion to the Latvian capital Riga; Ryanair is launching flights to three countries from Riga in the fall.
 "We always welcome further development of commercial aviation across the world," Estonian Air President Erki 
Urva told BNS on Tuesday.
"Estonian Air is not flying to Riga and we have at present no commercial interest in the Latvian market, thus, 
developments in Riga do not directly affect us."
 Urva added that right now AirBaltic too is already offering cheap flights from Riga to London and many other 
European destinations. "Estonian Air likewise offers flights from Tallinn to 13 and soon to 15 European cities," he 
stated.
 Ryanair announced on Tuesday plans to launch at the end of October flights from Riga to London, Frankfurt and 
Tampere. The firm has also opened a Latvian-language Web site. Fares are extremely low, which may make 
starting flights from Riga very attractive to Estonians.

 The Latvian Deputy Prime Minister Ainars Slesers is set on pushing the issue of accommodating Europe's budget 
airlines at the Riga international airport by raising the question for a government meeting by February next year.
 Slesers announced earlier in December that he is preparing to suggest a new strategy of operations for the Latvian 
capital's airport, allowing Europe's budget airlines to hub at Riga, thus boosting revenues for the airport and tourism 
in Latvia.
 The deputy PM has now announced that February next year is the final moment for making a clear decision, as 
Latvia must know what it wants by EU accession in May.
"By May we must know what we want, because the budget airlines are looking to move to Riga, Parnu, Kaunas, 
and it is therefore important to set out whether we want this," said Slesers.
 He said that the new concept for the Riga airport could, for example, foresee reductions to airlines for every 
100,000 passengers. Slesers believes that the Riga airport should be promoted as a small aviation center, with the 
Latvian capital becoming a hub for many destinations further on.
 Ryanair has already offers to fly in five directions in the first year after Latvia joins the Open Skies agreement upon 
joining the EU, said Slesers. The destinations include London, Stockholm, Brussels, Frankfurt and Milan, while a 
year later the airlines may fly also to Rome, Berlin, Oslo and Paris.
 The Latvian Deputy PM said that reductions on airport taxes should also be applied to all airlines already working 
at the airport, "thus the Latvian national carrier) airBaltic could also become a budget airline," of course, providing 
that it increases its planes, number of flights and cuts prices.
LATVIAN VICE-PM SET TO PUSH ISSUE OF BUDGET AIRLINES AT RIGA AIRPORT BY FEB
 The view posted by Slesers is firmly opposed by the management of the Riga airport. Deputy chairman of the Riga 
airport board, Andis Damlics, said that "budget airlines, like Easyjet, work only with small airports, which means that 
they can not offer transit opportunities, thus causing great difficulties."
 Damlics also said that the proposal could cause losses to traditional airlines operating at the airport, like British 
Airways and airBaltic, which will automatically have a bad toll on the airport and the big airlines may even leave the 
airport altogether.
 Slesers previously claimed that Ryanair is already prepared to use the airport, ensuring up to 600,000 passengers 
a year, which is just as much as the ten airlines operating at the Riga airport currently handle annually.

 The number of passengers using services of the Riga airport in the Latvian capital Riga will grow next year, 
including at least a 15-20 percent growth for passengers flying between Riga and London, said Toms Andersons, 
the Latvian representative of British Airways operating the route.
 He said passenger growth next year will be due to expected reduction of prices as low-cost airlines will enter the 
Latvian market and also improvement of general economic situation in the Baltic state.
Competition between air carriers in Latvia and in the world will increase next year, said Andersons. The Latvian 
market will have to divided anew, once low-cost operators make their entry but British Airways is certain it won't 
lose its market position because its offers will be competitive.
 Andersons believes that the leading European low-cost airline Ryanair won't be flying to Riga because it would go 
against their concept of never flying to main airports in any country. At the same time, Britain's EasyJet, also a low-
cost operator, could enter the Latvian market.
 Internet bookings of airplane tickets in Latvia will continue to grow in Latvia. If early this year 2.9 percent of tickets 
were booked through the web, in October the rate had risen to 7.5 percent already, said the British Airways 
representative in Latvia.
 In eleven months of this year British Airways carried 56,056 passengers between Riga and London, up 5.9 percent 
year-on-year.
 Throughout 2002 the British airline carried 57,126 passengers on the Riga-London route, a growth by 8.3 percent 
from 2001.

 The Latvian Deputy Prime Minister Ainars Slesers is preparing to suggest a new strategy of operations for the 
Latvian capital airport Riga, allowing also for Europe's budget airlines to hub at the country's modernized main 
airport.
 The Kommersant Baltic Daily reported that Slesers claimed that Ryanair is already prepared to use the airport, 
ensuring up to 600,000 passengers a year, which is just as much as the ten airlines operating at the airport 
currently handle.
 Slesers said that Ryanair wants to fly to London and Stockholm twice a day from Riga, daily to Brussels Frankfurt, 
Belgrade and later also to Rome and Oslo.
The unpopular Latvian deputy PM, has announced that Ryanair would be offering flights for an average price of 
around 44 euros. "Of course, some flights will be more expensive, others cheaper. But compare: if you want to buy 
a ticket to Copenhagen now in haste, you'd pay around 470 lats (EUR 700)!" he said.
 Slesers said that he plans to attract the budget airlines to Riga airport by offering reductions on airport fees. "My 
suggestion is such that airports should offer reductions depending on the number of passengers. If 100,000 
passengers are handled, the reduction is such, if 200,000 passengers are handled a year, the reduction is such and 
so on," said the deputy PM, adding that specific figures will be discussed with the Transport Minister next week.
 He said that he is sure the policies at Riga airport will be changed, thus boosting the annual turnover of passengers 
at Riga airport from 600,000 to 2 or 3 million, thus boosting also tourism and construction.

 The daily added that the Riga airport deputy chairman Andis Damlics does not agree, claiming that budget airlines 
stop at small airports and can not offer transit services to passengers. "For example, budget airlines do not land at 
Heathrow."
 Damlics also said that any such plans could automatically cause serious losses for large companies operating at 
the Riga airport, like airBaltic or British Airways, which may even lead to such airlines leaving the market altogether.

 Czech Airlines (CSA) expects two or three German low-cost airlines to show interest in flights to the Latvian capital 
Riga in next five years but doesn't believe in any greater number of new air carriers entering the market.
 "Germany is closer to Latvia than the United Kingdom, for example.
It takes about three hours to fly from Riga to London, and the cost price is not very cheap," CSA vice-president for 
marketing and sales Mihal Pozar told the Latvian business daily Bizness & Baltija.
 Pozar is quite skeptical about alleged interest by Europe's biggest low-cost airlines EasyJet and Ryanair in flights 
to Riga.
 "I do not know how attractive the Baltics look to Ryanair", he said, explaining that the Irish air company usually 
considered two aspects before entering a new market -- income per capita and number of holiday-makers.
 For these reasons, Ryanair will be more interested in Germany or Austria than Eastern Europe, said CSA 
representative. On the other hand, the West European market was already saturated and competition was very 
tough, he added.
 As of May 1 next year when Latvia joins the EU it will fall under the EU's open sky policies, allowing EU airlines to 
freely fly to any EU country they wish without additional state regulation.
 EasyJet and Ryanair representatives came to Riga to inquire about prices of services offered by the Riga airport 
but later told the press this visit should not be interpreted as increased interest in the Latvian capital in their part.
 In ten months of 2003 CSA carried 51,276 passengers between Riga and Prague, up 2 percent from the same 
period in 2002.

 Low fare airlines have been penetrating the air space of European countries actively, however, the Lithuanians still 
have no chances to go to London, Paris or any other remote European city for some 200 litas (EUR 58).
 Irish budget airline Ryanair, meanwhile, inquired about possible flights from Vilnius and the Karmelava airport in 
Kaunas last year.
Representative of the air carrier noted that flights to Lithuania would be entered onto the route map of the company 
as soon as Vilnius acceded the European Union and joined the Open Skies Agreement in Europe, the Lietuvos 
Rytas daily has reported.
 The airport of Karmelava, which sees its future bound with servicing of planes and passengers of budget airlines, 
launched talks with the Irish, however, the latest round of talks did not produce any promising results.
 In 2004 the Irish company will open a new route to one or another Baltic state, however, analysts doubt that the 
budget carrier would single out Lithuania.
 Low far air carriers strove to get the maximum possible fee discounts from airports, said Vidmantas Kairys, head of 
civil aviation department at the ministry of transportation.
 Ryanair would pay to the Kaunas airport mere EUR 500 per flight, however, the cost of services of the airport 
reaches at least EUR 2,500.

 Europe's leading cheap airline Ryanair rejected at the start of this week the Economy and Communications 
Ministry's proposal to discuss launching of flights to Estonia, the daily Eesti Paevaleht reports.
 Ryanair representative Paul Fitzsimmons declined to explain to the paper why the Estonian officials' proposal was 
turned down, repeating that the firm is in negotiations with around 50 airports across Europe and does not comment 
on their course individually.
Deputy chancellor of the ministry Signe Ratso said Ryanair has no interest in Estonia in the short term as the 
country cannot offer a suitable airport in the requisite time. In her words, the airline wants an airport it could start 
flying to in a couple of months.
 The meeting with representatives of the carrier was organized by an agent of the Enterprise Estonia foundation in 
London.
 Martin Jasko, PR adviser at the Economy Ministry, said Ryanair has been exploring also the possibility of 
launching flights to Latvia and Lithuania. The firm has been in direct contact with the Tallinn and Parnu airports, but 
not officially with the ministry. It is in view of information received from the said airports and the London 
representation of Enterprise Estonia that the ministry is convinced of Ryanair's interest in the Baltic region.
 "It's hard to find fast solutions for Ryanair concerning the Parnu and Tallinn airports," Jasko said. "Parnu needs 
investments before the start of regular flights, and in Tallinn high airport charges are the hurdle."

 Low cost air company Ryanair, registered in Ireland, is considering possibilities to launch flights to Latvia, indicates 
unofficial information obtained by Diena, the leading Latvian daily.
 Diena wrote Friday that central Latvian city Jelgava was cited as one of the possible destinations of the flights but 
the infrastructure available there today is not appropriate today.
 Ryanair and Latvian party officials neither confirmed, nor denied this information to Diena, saying they did not want 
to make their plans known to rivals.
Asked if Ryanair has launched talks on flights to any of Latvia's airports spokesman for the company said Ryanair's 
plans include launching flights to 14 countries in Europe with the company in process or about to launch talks with 
each of them, confirming the European Union candidate states are among these countries.
 Diena noted that the low cost air companies usually don't choose large airports as their destination but rather pick 
smaller airports which are located near large cities and hence are cheaper.
 Representatives of newly founded Lidosta Jelgava airport company in the central city Jelgava, some 40 kilometers 
away from Riga, declined to reveal further plans of the company citing they did not want to trigger reaction from 
rivals.
 Transport Ministry aviation department director Arnis Muiznieks said Latvia's small airports are not ready to admit 
the low cost airlines because all the small airports -- "Ventspils, Liepaja and even more so Jelgava need large 
investment".
IRELAND 'S LOW COST AIR CO RYANAIR COULD LAUNCH FLIGHTS TO LATVIA : PRESS
 He did not rule out though Ryanair "possibly, will make flights from London" because the passenger flow is 
sufficient only on that route.
 After accession of Latvia to the European Union, planned for May 1, 2004, the classical air companies operating in 
Latvia will not be protected by bilateral agreements between states any more with the so called open sky policy 
taking effect, allowing all Europe's air companies to ensure air traffic in any of the EU member states.
 Diena said the low-cost air companies today are developing fast despite general crisis in the air industry, saving on 
the cost of services and reducing costs for administration of ticket sales, selling tickets via the internet.
 According to press reports in Latvia's neighboring countries, Ryanair has also launched talks with Estonia and 
Lithuania with Parnu and Kaunas respectively cited as destinations there for flights expected to launch in summer 
2004. Hamburg, Frankfurt, London and Stockholm were cited as destinations in Western Europe.

 VENTSPILS NAFTA SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT, DISADVANTAGEOUS FOR THE STATE, TERMINATED. 
The shareholder agreement of Ventspils nafta oil terminal shareholders, closed six years ago and seen as 
disadvantageous and, Economics Minister Juris Lujans believes, even discriminatory towards the state, has been 
terminated.
 The agreement was terminated after a proposal by Latvijas Naftas Tranzits, the largest private shareholder of VN, 
and will involve no payment of any charges on the part of the state. The agreement on the termination of the 
shareholders agreement was Thursday signed on behalf of the state by the Latvian Privatization Agency, 
Economics Ministry reported.
As a result, the state regains a status of a full shareholder with all the rights provided under the law and will be able 
to freely decide upon both selling its stake of 38 percent in VN and vote in VN shareholders meetings without 
coordinating positions with LNT. (Diena, NRA, DB, B&B)

 The city councils of Riga and Ventspils are set to request President Vaira Vike-Freiberga not to promulgate the

 Specialists in law meanwhile say the lawmaker has again pursued absurd practice adopting substantial 
amendments to the law just to solve one specific case. (NRA, DB, B&B)

 Latvia's air carriers will not lose competitiveness after the country's expected EU accession, stated the Latvian 
Transport Ministry's Aviation Department Director Arnis Muiznieks.
 "Latvia's air carriers are seriously working to be ready for competition after Latvia's EU accession, therefore I 
believe they are strong enough to survive the battle," said Muiznieks.
He said that after May next year, when the Baltic state is set to join the EU, Latvia will not be flooded with budget 
airlines, but service quality will improve and competition will become fierce. "There's no reason to claim that a whole 
many new routes will be opened, as the flow of passengers to distant countries from Latvia is almost constant," said 
the aviation specialist.
 The only direct route Muiznieks expects to be launched by budget airlines would be the Riga-London route, while 
quite a few airlines may also start transit flights through Riga airport. He also mentioned that Ryanair and Easyjet 
would be the potential airlines that may start new flights to and from Riga after Latvia's EU accession next May.

 The Irish cheap flights company Ryanair need not launch flights from Estonia any time soon, as the firm has no 
contracts with local airports.
 Parnu and Tallinn have been mentioned as Ryanair's potential base airfields in Estonia, but relations have not 
developed farther from the first fleeting contacts, the daily Aripaev reported.
AS Parnu Lennujaam (Parnu Airport) director Erki Teemagi said that in their case the ned to invest into the airport's 
infrastucture prevents the launching of regular passenger flights.
 "It is impossible to launch regular international passenger flights from Parnu at the moment, as this would require 
significant investments," Teemagi said. "Ideally, we would need hundreds of millions of kroons, the minimum need 
being about 10 million kroons (EUR 640,000)," he added.
 Tallinn Airport marketing director Eduard Tuur said they too had had some contacts with Ryanair, but no 
agreements had been reached so far.
 Tuur said Ryanair wanted to receive a discount to launch flights from Tallinn. "They laid down the terms on which 
they would launch flights, but we cannot accept them such as they are," he said.
 A lower airport tax would give Ryanair an advantage over other carriers, Tuur said. "We cannot drop the airport tax 
as low as Ryanair would like," Tuur said.
 Neither has Ryanair taken contact with the local Aviation Administration concerning the launching of flights.
