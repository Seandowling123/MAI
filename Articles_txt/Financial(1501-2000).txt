Back in black Ryanair to the fore as sector stages revival
Back in black Ryanair to the fore as sector stages revival

Ryanair has announced that it returned to profit in the year to March 31, narrowly beating market expectations, and 
says it expects further improvements in the coming year.
Pre-tax profits for the Dublin-based airline were (EURO)1.44bn on revenues of (EURO)10.8bn, against a 
(EURO)430mn loss and (EURO)4.8bn of revenues in the year to March 2022. Profit after tax but before exceptional 
items - the company's preferred measure - was (EURO)1.43bn, compared with a (EURO)355mn loss a year before.
Analysts had expected a figure of between (EURO)1.32bn and (EURO)1.42bn.
The figures are the latest evidence of a rebound in the European airline industry and of Ryanair's strong post- Covid 
recovery.
It carried 169mn passengers in the financial year, against 97mn a year before. The figure for the year to March 
2023 was 13 per cent above the figure for the year to March 2020, before Covid disruption set in.
Ryanair's load factor - the proportion of seats filled on its flights - recovered to 93 per cent, against 82 per cent for 
the year to March 2022.
Chief financial officer Neil Sorahan said the business had a "rebound" in traffic after a "difficult" April-to-June quarter 
last year.
"We saw traffic across the remaining quarters increase quite significantly," he said.
Back in black Ryanair to the fore as sector stages revival
Costs - at (EURO)31 per passenger excluding fuel - were back at pre- Covid levels, but fares were higher thanks to 
strong demand and tight capacity across the sector.
Ryanair projected further growth in passenger numbers and profits in the year to March 2024, saying it expected to 
carry 185mn passengers in the year. Robert Wright

Greek stocks rallied in the wake of Kyriakos Mitsotakis's strong showing in national elections.
The prime minister unexpectedly increased his centre-right party's share of the votes, although its final tally is likely 
to fall short of a parliamentary majority.
Greek banks led the rally, outperforming the wider market, with Alpha, Piraeus, Eurobank and the National Bank of 
Greece all rising sharply.
Pundits expected Mitsotakis to call for new elections in about a month rather than seek a coalition.
Ryanair climbed after returning to profitability in the year to March 31.
The budget airline posted profit after tax but before exceptionals of (EURO)1.43bn, topping analyst estimates of 
(EURO)1.4bn.
The beat was primarily driven by better than expected pricing with full-year fares up 10 per cent against pre-Covid 
levels.
A downgrade weighed on Germany's Hornbach, the do-it-yourself store chain, which had its rating cut from "buy" to 
"hold" by Berenberg.
The revision followed guidance by Hornbach last week in which it suggested that operating earnings could fall in its 
2023-24 financial year.

 Is it any surprise that the airline which sells in-flight scratch-offs hit the jackpot?
 Ireland's Ryanair announced on Monday it bagged a full-year net profit of €1.4 billion ($1.5 billion). The airline's 
CEO Michael O'Leary told  the Financial Times he wants the company to chase aggressive growth, and its earnings 
suggest a key tactic will involve a dash of gambler's luck.
 Cue "Danny Boy" 
 Ryanair has a reputation for two things in Europe: a distinctly sassy social media presence, and alarmingly cheap 
airfares. Some Ryanair tickets go for as little as €9.99, although tragically those ticket prices may now become a 
relic, CFO Neil Sorahan told Bloomberg . "The days of the 9.99s are possibly behind us for some time," Sorahan 
said.
 But exorbitant €20 tickets aren't the only wind beneath Ryanair's wings. O'Leary was keen to highlight the airline's 
use of a practice called "fuel hedging," which helped offset rising fuel prices in the company's earnings report:
 Fuel hedging is when a company places contracts for fuel in advance at a fixed rate. It's essentially a bet that the 
cost of fuel is going to rise. If the price of fuel drops then the airline is out of luck.
 Ryanair says it's 80% hedged, which aviation analyst Sindy Foster tells The Daily Upside is a pretty hefty bet, as 
most airlines hedge between 30-64%. "It indicates they expect fuel prices to remain unstable and unpredictable, so 
by hedging a high percentage they minimize the risk. If they have called it wrong, it will be the opposite," Foster 
said.
Ryanair Wins Big On Results, Bets Big On Hedging
 Although fuel hedging is a gamble, it also creates a sense of certainty. "If you have fixed a large percentage of your 
costs it gives you the ability to focus on generating maximum revenue at the right price to cover your costs and 
generate profit," Foster said, adding: "You aren't always chasing your tail as you would be with fluctuating fuel 
prices." The returns can also be pretty staggering. Southwest Airlines and Air France-KLM said in August 2022 that 
they'd each saved around $1 billion  from hedging.
 Dogfight: O'Leary told the FT he wants Ryanair to run the competition out of town. "As long as we don't do 
something stupid -- which is a daily challenge in this industry -- we will continue to wipe the floor with every other 
airline in Europe," he said. Given Ryanair's infamously spartan flights, it might have fliers wiping the floors of its 
planes soon, too.

Ryanair posts record £1.26bn profits - but warns of turbulence with strikes

RYANAIR posted record profits of $1.57bn (£1.26bn) in its full year results, as it cashed in on rising fares and 
strong traffic recovery, but warned it may experience future turbulence.
The low-cost carrier flew a record 168.6m passengers, up 74 per cent, in the year ending March and said it expects 
passenger demand to remain high over summer.
It forecast passenger numbers rising to 185m by the end of 2023 and further profit rises, but warned this could be 
affected by high fuel prices, as well as air traffic controller strikes in France.
The results come as resurgent travel demand continues to bolster airlines' post-pandemic recovery.
Chief Michael O'Leary said: "This summer we will operate our largest schedule… capitalising on traffic restoration 
and multi-year growth deals." Ryanair shares rose 1.98 per cent following the announcement.
The airline said it was "cautiously optimistic that FY24 revenue will grow to cover our (EURO)1bn higher fuel bill 
and deliver a modest year-on-year profit increase" - as long as it avoids "adverse events" like the war in Ukraine 
and Boeing delivery delays.

May 23, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Mar 31, 2023) loss of 73 cents per share 
(excluding a penny from non-recurring items), narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 99 cents. 
In the year-ago reported quarter, RYAAY had reported a loss of 98 cents per share. 
Revenues of $1,981.5 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,908.7 million. Revenues improved year 
over year, driven by upbeat passenger volumes. 
On the back of the buoyant traffic scenario, RYAAY's profit after tax was €1.42 Billion in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 
against the net loss of €355 million incurred a year ago. In the same period, operating costs climbed 75% to €9.20 
billion, driven by a 113% increase in fuel expenses to €3.90 billion. 
Average fares in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 were up 10% from the corresponding pre-COVID level. Net debt at 
RYAAY declined to €0.56 billion at the fiscal fourth-quarter end from €1.45 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2022. 
Ryanair raised its traffic view for fiscal 2024 to 185 million (prior view: 165 million). 
Currently, Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here[1]. Performances of Other Transportation Companies J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.'s JBHT[2] 
first-quarter 2023 earnings of $1.89 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.04 and declined 17.5% 
year over year. 
JBHT's total operating revenues of $3,229.58 million also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,434.4 million 
and fell 7.4% year over year. The downfall was due to declines in the volume of 25% in Integrated Capacity 
Solutions (ICS), 5% in Intermodal (JBI) and 17% in Final Mile Services (FMS), and a 17% decline in revenue per 
load in Truckload (JBT). Revenue declines in ICS, JBI, FMS and JBT were partially offset by Dedicated Contract 
Services revenue growth of 13%. 
JBHT's total operating revenues, excluding fuel surcharges, decreased 10.2% year over year. 
Delta Air Lines' DAL[3] first-quarter 2023 earnings (excluding 82 cents from non-recurring items) of 25 cents per 
share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents. Volatile fuel prices and unfavorable weather conditions 
led to this downtick. DAL reported a loss of $1.23 per share a year ago, dull in comparison to the current scenario, 
as air-travel demand was not so buoyant then. 
Ryanair (RYAAY) Q4 Loss Narrower Than Expected, Revenues Rise Y/Y
DAL reported revenues of $12,759 million, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,767.4 million. 
Driven by higher air-travel demand, total revenues increased 36.49% on a year-over-year basis. 
Alaska Air Group, Inc. ALK[4] reportedfirst-quarter 2023loss of 62 cents per share, wider thanthe Zacks Consensus 
Estimate of a loss of 48 cents. In the year-ago quarter, ALK incurred a loss of $1.33 per share. 
ALK's operating revenues of $ 2,196 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,202.5 million. The top line 
jumped 31% year over year, with passenger revenues accounting for 90.3% of the top line and increasing 31% 
owing to continued recovery in air-travel demand.

Ryanair passengers have been warned to "book early to avoid rising close-in prices" but the threat shouldn't be of 
too much concern to holidaymakers.
The budget airline reported a strong full year, as expected, with traffic recovering post-pandemic, fares improving 
and "advantageous fuel hedges."
Although 85% of its fuel was hedged at US$89bbl, it was still the driving force behind a 75% increase in total 
operating costs to (EURO)9.2bn.
Fuel rose by 113% to (EURO)3.9bn, and the airline expects to add another (EURO)1bn in fuel costs in the current 
financial year.
"The outlook for full-year 2024 has fuel costs increasing by more than (EURO)1bn, higher than the (EURO)600mln 
we assume, and a rise in ex-fuel unit costs compared to our flat trajectory," said Peel Hunt.
While it emphasised it expected a strong summer, rising fuel costs, as well as possible delivery delays from Boeing, 
could dampen the mood, at least for customers. 
To offset rising costs, it warned it would be raising prices, and urged customers to book as early as possible.
Price rises shouldn't be of too much concern to holidaymakers looking to get away over the next year, however, and 
"demand remains robust" even with fares tracking higher, said Liberum.
Ryanair may be hiking prices, but customers shouldn't be concerned
John Strickland, director of JLS Consulting, said Ryanair's low fare base of under £40 means even a double-digit 
increase in price would leave them competitive against the likes of EasyJet and Wizzair.
Importantly, it will be "affordable for their target audience," Strickland added.

Ryanair predicted its passenger numbers will almost double in ten years as it swung strongly into profit in the 
financial year just ended.
Revenues at the Irish carrier jumped 124% to (EURO)10.8bn as fares rose compared to a 75% hike in costs, a gap 
that helped after-tax profits to recover to (EURO)1.43bn from Covid-dominated losses of (EURO)355mln the year 
before.
Passengers carried in the year to end March 2023 rose by 74% to 168.6mln, with the load factor on its planes also 
bouncing back to 93% from 82%.
For the current year (2023-24), Ryanair said it expects to carry 185mln passengers, a 10% increase and sees a 
steady rise in that number from then on helped by its order for 300 new Boeing Max-10s, which has now been 
signed, it added.
Ryanair expects the number of passengers carried each year to reach 225mln by 2026 and 300mln by 2034.
The airline also swung to net cash of (EURO)0.56bn (from net debt of (EURO)1.43bn), which with ongoing cash 
flow will enable it to pay back a (EURO)750mln maturing bond in August and fund (EURO)2.6bn of capex this year, 
said chief executive Michael O' Leary, who added this is the peak of its new fleet investment.
O'Leary noted the airline's fuel bill will rise by (EURO)1bn in the current twelve months, while staff costs, higher 
crew ratios and airport charges will also have an impact.
Ryanair expects passengers to double in ten years, profits soar
Even so, he added he is "cautiously optimistic" revenue will grow sufficiently to cover the higher costs and profits 
will rise modestly.
Dublin-listed Ryanair shares rose by 2% to (EURO)15.95.

easyJet (London Luton) has announced it is expanding its UK network by opening a new three-A320-200 base at 
Birmingham, GB in March 2024, marking its first UK base opening since the Covid-19 pandemic.
The move follows easyJet's return to growth in the UK this summer, where it will operate its largest UK flying 
programme to date with around 8% more capacity than pre-pandemic, flying one million more seats and operating 
57 new routes, including 23 from the UK, the airline said in a statement.
The budget carrier said the new base - its ninth in the UK - would strengthen its position in the UK market and 
enable it to launch more new routes to some of Europe's most popular leisure destinations next year. More details 
were not disclosed. easyJet already serves key domestic and international routes from Birmingham, including 
Amsterdam Schiphol (Netherlands), Geneva (Switzerland), Milan Malpensa and Naples Capodichino (Italy), Lisbon 
and Faro (Portugal), and Palma de Mallorca (Spain). easyJet's eight other bases in the UK include London Gatwick, 
London Luton, Bristol International, Manchester International, Liverpool, Glasgow International, Edinburgh, and 
Belfast International.
According to ch-aviation capacities data, easyJet already holds the fourth-largest market share at Birmingham, with 
a 7% share of weekly airline seats. Jet2 (United Kingdom) is the largest carrier at Birmingham, with a 22.4% market 
share, followed by Ryanair with 19.4% and TUI Airways with 19.3%.
Fleet update
Meanwhile, easyJet will take delivery of eleven leased A320-200s between now and the first quarter of FY 2024, 
the airline disclosed in its half-year results ending March 31, 2023, published on May 18.
This would make up for any shortfalls in new aircraft deliveries from Airbus. easyJet has an order book of 163 firm 
orders - 130 for A320neo and thirty-three A321neo. This includes an aircraft purchase approved in summer 2022, 
securing 56 aircraft deliveries with the conversion of eighteen A320neo into A321neo for delivery between FY2026 
and FY2029.
In addition to the accelerated delivery of two aircraft from FY2025 to FY2023, easyJet said it agreed to take a 
further two FY2025 aircraft deliveries in FY2024.
EasyJet to open Birmingham base in 2Q 2024
easyJet's total fleet on March 31, 2023, comprised 328 aircraft (versus 320 jets on September 30, 2022, excluding 
three A319-100s held on a zero rent basis).
The increase was driven by:
delivery of five new A320neo aircraft, including accelerating two FY 2025 scheduled orders into FY 2023;
acquisition of three mid-life A320-200 leased aircraft;
re-entry into the fleet of one former easyJet A319-100 and the return to service of three A319-100s held on a zero-
rental agreement in 2022.
Four older leased aircraft exited the fleet at the end of their lease term (two A319-100s and two A320-200s) as 
easyJet continues to retire older, less efficient aircraft.
According to the ch-aviation fleets ownership module, the easyJet UK fleet at present comprises 173 aircraft, 
including fifty-seven A319-100s; seventy-two A320-200s (with four on order); thirty-four A320-200Ns (with 140 on 
order), and ten A321-200NXs (with 33 on order).
Half-year results
easyJet posted an improved first-half performance for the six months to March 31, 2023. "Demand for easyJet's 
flights and holidays has continued to grow in the half, resulting in more than a GBP120 million pound (USD149 
million) improvement in our performance as well as a GBP1 billion (USD1.2 billion) revenue improvement year-on-
year," commented Chief Executive Officer Johan Lundgren.
Highlights include the following:
Headline loss before tax was GBP411 million (USD511 million);
GBP200 million (USD248 million) net debt with GBP3.5 billion (USD4.3 billion) in cash and money market deposits;
Total revenue increased by 80% to GBP2.689 million (USD3.343 million) predominantly due to pricing strength, 
increased flown capacity, improved load factors and ancillary products continuing to deliver incremental revenue;
Group headline costs increased by 52% to GBP3.1 million (USD3.8 million), primarily due to the increase in flown 
capacity, significantly increased fuel costs and industry-wide inflationary pressures, combined with resilience 
measures as part of the summer 2023 ramp-up preparations and 15 wet-lease aircraft which were within the fleet in 
October 2022.
During 2Q easyJet flew 17.7 million seats compared to 14.8 million seats in the same period last year. Load factors 
were 88% (2Q FY22: 78%) due to increased customer demand and restriction-free travel.
Based on current high levels of demand and strong bookings, easyJet anticipates exceeding current market profit 
expectations of GBP260 million (USD323 million) for FY 2023.

Ryanair Anticipates Continued Airline Consolidation in Europe

Ryanair expects that airline consolidation will continue in Europe during the next two years but warns that capacity 
growth will be constrained by lagging aircraft deliveries.
The Irish low-cost carrier group, which includes Ryanair, Buzz, Lauda, and Malta Air, ended FY2023 with a net 
profit of (EURO)1.43 billion ($1.5 billion), despite ending Q4 FY2023 with a net loss of (EURO)154 million ($166.3 
million).
The group carried 168.6 million passengers throughout the financial year, which is a 74% increase compared to 
97.1 million the previous financial year, with an average load factor of 93% (FY2022: 82%). Revenues grew from 
(EURO)4.8 billion ($5.1 billion) to (EURO)10.7 billion ($11.5 billion) between FY2022 and FY2023, with operating 
costs rising during the same period, from (EURO)5.2 billion ($5.6 billion) to (EURO)9.2 billion ($9.9 billion).
At the end of the financial period, which finished on March 31, 2023, Ryanair operated 537 aircraft, 98 of which 
were Boeing 737 MAX-8200 planes nicknamed "Gamechangers" by the airline.
The airline group opened five new bases and 300 new routes in FY2023.
Ryanair's growing market share
The airline noted that its market share has grown significantly within markets across the European Union (EU).
"Ryanair's market share has grown significantly in most EU markets as we operated 116% of our pre-Covid 
capacity in FY23. Most notable gains were recorded in Italy (from 27% to 40%), Poland (26% to 36%) and Ireland 
(49% to 58%)," the airline commented in its financial results presentation for FY2023.
This carrier also noted that it will operate its "largest-ever schedule" this summer, offering 3,000 daily flights and a 
total of 2,500 routes throughout the three-month period.
Capacity in the EU is lower compared to pre-COVID-19, with numerous airlines going bust or reducing fleets during 
the pandemic, and issues such as high oil prices and a shortage of new and leased aircraft impacting the ability of 
surviving carriers to deploy capacity. However, Ryanair claimed "demand is notably robust".
Ryanair Anticipates Continued Airline Consolidation in Europe
"Forward bookings and air fares currently into [Summer 2023] are strong and we continue to urge all customers to 
book early to avoid rising "close-in" prices," the low-cost carrier continued.
However, the company also expects that airlines will continue to consolidate across the continent over the next two 
years, with competing carriers deploying capacity in a "disciplined manner".
"The large backlog of OEM aircraft deliveries is likely to constrain capacity growth in Europe for at least 4 more 
years which confers a considerable growth premium on Ryanair's remaining 110 B737 Gamechangers deliveries 
over the next 3 summers," the airline added.
Aircraft deliveries impacting outlook
Going forward the carrier remains cautiously optimistic that it can achieve its target of carrying 185 million 
passengers by the end of FY2024.
However, the airline also noted that recent delivery delays from Boeing could push the growth of traffic into the 
"lower yielding H2 [FY2024] and may reduce this target [185 million passengers - ed. note] slightly".
The airline stated that it expects to be short of up to 10 Boeing 737 MAX-8200 aircraft for the peak months of June 
and July 2023.
"To facilitate Boeing, and to assist their resumption of scheduled B-8200 deliveries this autumn, we will take 
delivery of aircraft through July (and possibly into Aug.). We hope and expect that Boeing will recover quickly from 
this recent delay to minimise its impact on our FY24 traffic growth and profitability," Ryanair added.
In addition to supply chain constraints, Boeing has been forced to suspend some 737 MAX deliveries due to a 
production issue at Spirit AeroSystems, a Tier 1 supplier for the manufacturer. Boeing had previously issued 
guidance stating that while it hopes to deliver between 400 and 450 B737 MAX aircraft in 2023, the delivery delays 
will remove around 9,000 seats from customers' schedules during the summer.
While Ryanair said that it has a "significant cost advantage" over its competitors, costs excluding fuel are expected 
to grow in H1 2023 and "will not be fully offset by B737 Gamechanger deliveries".
Still, demand for the upcoming summer remains robust, with peak fares trending ahead of summer 2022.
The airline group noted that it remains "cautiously optimistic that FY24 revenue will grow sufficiently to cover our 
(EURO)1bn [$1.08 billion] higher fuel bill and still deliver a modest year-on-year profit increase".
But the guidance is also dependent on events such as the war in Ukraine and the delivery schedule of Boeing 
aircraft.

Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier, announced a net profit of 1.43 billion euros ($1.55 billion) for the full year. The 
company experienced a resurgence in travel demand and fares throughout the year, despite a challenging first 
quarter due to the conflict in Ukraine. Full-year traffic saw a remarkable 74% increase, reaching 168.6 million 
customers, while fares rose by 10% compared to pre-Covid levels.
Although operating costs rose by 75% to 9.2 billion euros, primarily due to a 113% increase in fuel costs, Ryanair 
managed to offset this through advantageous fuel hedging positions. The airline's unit costs per passenger, at 31 
euros, remained significantly lower than those of its European competitors.
Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, attributed the airline's substantial profit outcome to its industry-leading fuel 
hedging strategy, which saved the company over 1.4 billion euros. By purchasing fuel through forward contracts at 
fixed prices, Ryanair hedges against the risk of potential oil price increases. Currently, Ryanair has hedged 85% of 
its fuel at $89 per barrel for this year, which will result in an additional $1 billion in fuel costs. Despite this increase, 
the airline remains confident in covering the expense and expects modest year-on-year profit growth.
With a BBB+ credit rating and 4.7 billion euros in gross cash at year-end, Ryanair maintains one of the strongest 
balance sheets in the industry. The majority of the airline's B737 fleet is owned and unencumbered, providing a 
significant cost advantage as interest rates and leasing costs continue to rise for competitors.
Ryanair recently finalized an agreement to purchase 300 new Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft, consisting of 150 firm 
orders and 150 future options, to be delivered between 2027 and 2033. This acquisition aligns with Ryanair's goal 
of carrying 300 million passengers annually by 2034. The increased seating capacity, coupled with enhanced fuel 
efficiency, positions Ryanair with a considerable unit-cost advantage over other European airlines.
While Ryanair considers its low-cost base as its primary advantage for expanding its presence in Europe, the 
company acknowledges that the aviation industry itself presents the greatest risk to its growth strategy. Despite 
occasional challenges, Ryanair's robust balance sheet and cost structure enable it to weather potential storms.
Ryanair's CFO, Neil Sorohan, emphasizes the inevitability of consolidation within the European airline industry. The 
pandemic has already triggered a systemic change in capacity, with many airlines downsizing. Sorohan expects 
further consolidation, pointing to examples such as the merger of ITA (formerly Alitalia) into Lufthansa and the 
Ryanair Reports Strong Profit Boosted by Increased Traffic and Favorable Fuel Hedges
potential sale of TAP in Portugal. He predicts that more low-cost carriers will likely merge in the coming years, 
ultimately resulting in a market structure resembling the U.S. model, with a small number of large carriers 
dominating the majority of European air traffic.
Sorohan believes that while larger European flag carriers, such as Air France KLM and Lufthansa, will persist, 
Ryanair's strength lies in its short-haul, point-to-point model. The company is poised to be a significant player in this 
segment of the market.

A Belarusian blogger handed a jail sentence for opposition activities, Roman Protasevich, has been pardoned two 
years after his spectacular arrest and just a few weeks after his conviction.
"First and foremost, I am incredibly grateful to the country and the president personally for this decision," 
Protasevich said in Minsk on Monday, according to Belarusian media.
Protasevich was shown several times on Belarusian state television after his arrest, where he distanced himself 
from his opposition activism.
Protasevich's spectacular arrest in May 2021 caused a stir far beyond the borders of the ex-Soviet republic. 
Together with his then girlfriend Sofia Sapega, he was on a flight from Athens to Vilnius when the Ryanair plane 
was forced to land in Minsk by the Belarusian authorities because of an alleged bomb threat. Subsequently, both 
were detained.
Sapega, a Russian citizen, was later sentenced to six years in prison - and has since been transferred to Russia.
Protasevich was sentenced to eight years in prison in early May. The prosecution accused the former editor-in-chief 
of the opposition Telegram channel Nexta of an attempted coup d'état.
Nexta called for protests against the authoritarian ruler Alexander Lukashenko, who had himself declared the 
winner of the 2020 presidential election. Lukashenko brutally suppressed the subsequent street protests. The vote 
was not recognized internationally.
Protasevich's relatives assume that he made his pro-government statements in detention under pressure and 
torture.
Hundreds of Lukashenko opponents remain in prison. Many have rejected any kind of deal with the authorities.

Ryanair stock price and airliner 
Ryanair (NASDAQ: RYAAY)  shares are trading relatively flat during the trading session on Monday morning; as the 
company releases its fiscal year 2023 results to the public, some investors may be taking a breather before 
deciding the direction of the company and the stock as a result. In addition, some analysts have lost faith in the 
European airline operator after lowering their price targets a few months ago. 
]However, today's entire picture looks a lot different in a positive way, leading some to think that these targets may 
be raised again to their former glory and above. 
As industry volumes start to pick up, looming competition in part from names like Deutsche Lufthansa (OTCMKTS: 
DLAKY)  is felt and voted in by financial markets. While Lufthansa is currently trading on a price-to-earnings ratio of 
12.5x versus Ryanair's 13.1x, this does not necessarily imply more or less potential; it is simply a vote. 
This vote merely translates into investors willing to pay a higher premium for Ryanair's current (and future) 
underlying earnings over those of Lufthansa. They would be wise to do so considering the trends the company is 
experiencing and is poised to continue to ride on. The Recovery Play
Ryanair's website hosts a monthly "key stats" section , where investors can gauge the company's activity levels by 
analyzing trends in metrics such as the number of passengers, load factors, and customer satisfaction stemming 
from the percentage of on-time flight schedules. For example, over a twelve-month basis, volumes have increased 
by a 7% as measured by the number of passengers, 16 million in April 2023 versus 14.2 million a year prior. 
This metric, compared on a month-to-month period, will serve better justice to the improving trends the company is 
experiencing. For example, March of 2023 saw only 12.6 million passengers, 21% lower than April's 16 million 
volume, amplifying one of the foundational reasons investors should take advantage of the next flight up RYAAY 
stock.   
As these volumes increased, trends enabled management to report a 124% revenue increase within their 
earnings press release . Outperforming bearish expectations are only the beginning, as the company overcame a 
355 million Euro loss in the first quarter of 2022 to report a 1.43 billion Euro net income a year later. Of course, 
these benefits trickled down to investors as earnings per share improved from a loss of 0.21 euros to a gain of 1.16 
Euros per share. The highlighted trends contributing to these positive results lie within a 74% increase in total 
Can Ryanair Stock Fly Above Resistance Levels, What Earnings Show
traffic, a 10% increase in fares over pre-COVID levels, optimized cost structures, and expansionary CAPEX leading 
to increased market share in the region. All in the Numbers
As Ryanair analyst ratings  point to a low double-digit upside target from today's stock prices, there are reasons to 
believe that conservative assumptions lead to these targets. As of the first quarter of 2023, free cash flows stood at 
nearly 2 billion euros, a 62% increase year over year; investors could start to expect no further share dilutions 
needed to finance the company's operating losses. As operating expenses declined by a massive 75% from 
management initiatives to boost margins, investors can be reassured that their financial well-being is kept in mind. 
Fuel and oil costs were down by an impressive 113%. However, investors should not be as impressed, considering 
oil prices are virtually out of management's control. What is more important to note is the double-digit cost 
reductions across all the other items, which command can and did have a direct hands-on effect. 
Staff costs were reduced by 53% as layoffs were implemented, and efficiency was a key management measure this 
year. As Ryanair expands and rejuvenates its fleet, its subsequent maintenance and repairs expenses have come 
down from previous levels, these items saw a 46% reduction during the measured twelve-month period. 
These heating trends have no end in sight, as management is replenishing - and expanding - its fleet of airplanes 
as if expecting sustained demand shortly. Within its earnings presentation , management announced its order 
placement for 300 MAX-10 jets from Boeing (NYSE: BA) . Considering that Boeing is experiencing increased  order 
backlogs from various airline operators, it is safe to assume that Ryanair is also poised to ride on industry-wide 
tailwinds.  
As Ryanair charts  show, the stock is attempting a breakout from previous resistance/support levels within the $90-
$95 per share range. Considering it has held up nicely above these levels, investors could reasonably expect 
further analyst rating upgrades amid bullish results, which should also aid in the subsequent price rally in the stock.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said it returned to profit in its recently concluded financial year 
and is "cautiously optimistic" of further growth in the new year, amid robust demand. 
The  Dublin-based budget airline said total revenue more than doubled to EUR10.78 billion in the financial year to 
March 31 from EUR4.80 billion a year before. 
Ryanair swung to a pretax profit of EUR1.44 billion from a loss of EUR429.8 million. 
From the previous year, load factor improved to 93% from 82%, as customer numbers rose by 74% to 168.6 million 
- which was also 13% ahead of financial 2020's levels, before the Covid-19 pandemic, Ryanair noted.  
Total operating costs rose 75% to EUR9.20 billion, mostly due to higher fuel costs, which more than doubled to 
EUR3.90 billion. 
The airline hailed its commitment to maintaining jobs throughout the pandemic, when its competitors had cut 
thousands of jobs. Ryanair said the strategy meant it was fully staffed to operate its summer schedule in 2022, 
whereas its competitors cancelled capacity, often at short notice, due to staff shortages. 
"As Ryanair grows traffic to [225 million per annum] by [financial 2026 and [300 million by financial 2034], our group 
will create over 10,000 new jobs for highly paid pilots, cabin crew, and engineers," it said. 
With short-haul capacity below pre-Covid levels, demand is "notably robust", Ryanair said, with forward bookings 
and air fares currently into Summer 2023 "strong". 
The airline said it hopes annual traffic will grow 10% in financial 2024 to 185 million.
"Boeing's recent delivery delays may push some of this growth into the lower yielding H2 and may reduce this 
target slightly," it warned. 
TOP NEWS: Ryanair swings to EUR1.44 billion profit as revenue doubles
Earlier this month, Ryanair placed an order for up to 300 new Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft, worth around USD40 
billion a list prices. 
In April, Boeing said the model would be hit by delays, after a defect was discovered. When the Ryanair order was 
announced, Boeing's co-chief executive officer said he was "confident" the company will fulfil the order. 
For the current year, Ryanair expects its fuel bill to rise by over EUR1 billion, due to higher oil prices, but its jet fuel 
costs are almost 85% hedged, it said. 
The airline also expects a "modest" increase in unit costs, excluding fuel, due to higher staff costs and increased 
enroute charges. 
"Despite ongoing uncertainty over the timing of Boeing deliveries, almost 15% unhedged fuel, limited [second 
quarter] visibility and zero [second half] fare visibility (normal at this time of year), we are cautiously optimistic that 
[financial 2024] revenue will grow sufficiently to cover our EUR1 billion higher fuel bill and still deliver a modest 
year-on-year profit increase," the Irish carrier said.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has vowed to push for breakneck growth and win more market share from 
rivals in Europe, as he presses ahead with a goal to double passenger numbers over the next decade.
The airline's ambitious new target to fly an annual 300mn passengers by 2034 would be more than any airline has 
yet managed in history. Even as the company bought 300 short-haul aircraft in a $40bn deal with Boeing earlier this 
month, some investors and analysts have questioned whether there are enough passengers left to carry in Europe, 
particularly at a time of rising climate concerns.
O'Leary agreed that the airline would moderate its growth rate into the single digits of around 4-5 per cent a year, 
but said this was enough to hit its forecasts. He said there was still plenty of room to steal market share from rivals 
in western Europe, as well as stimulate demand in new markets in central and eastern Europe.
"I think the thesis that there's no more growth in Europe, [and that] Europe is completely tapped out is wrong," he 
told the Financial Times. "As long as we don't do something stupid - which is a daily challenge in this industry - we 
will continue to wipe the floor with every other airline in Europe."
Ryanair boss targets aviation passenger record O'Leary aims for 300mn annually, even though industry experts 
question whether the European market is big enough
Ryanair has been European aviation's post-pandemic winner, moving into new markets as financially weaker rivals 
have retrenched. It expects to carry a record 168mn passengers in the year to the end of March, 13 per cent higher 
than before Covid.
The carrier is already the largest in Europe by passengers, and Alex Irving, an analyst at Bernstein, sees a different 
growth trajectory. He pictures the airline's growth inevitably slowing as the industry stabilises following the 
pandemic. Its home market of western Europe was "essentially fully penetrated", he said.
"Double-digit, and even high singledigit growth rates, were sustainable while it was smaller, but as a near-600 plane 
airline, it cannot maintain these rates without spoiling yields," he added.
Irving instead expects Ryanair to pivot from concentrating on high growth to returning cash to shareholders, and 
estimates payouts of (EURO)2bn per year in the near future.
But O'Leary is unmoved by doubts over whether it can find all those extra passengers in an already mature market, 
particularly at a time when policymakers are raising carbon taxes on flying. Speaking in Ryanair's offices near 
Dublin airport, O'Leary boiled the business model down to three words: "lowest cost wins".
Analysts agree that no European airline other than Hungarian carrier Wizz Air comes close to matching Ryanair's 
cost base after the Irish airline spent decades stripping costs and passing the benefit on to consumers through 
lower fares.
It uses a single fleet of aircraft to keep maintenance costs low, keeps a regular flow of new, more efficient planes to 
lower fuel consumption. It targets quick turnrounds at generally cheap airports to sweat its assets to the maximum.
The obsessive focus on low costs and subsequent "no frills" experience has left Ryanair with a www.reputation.UK 
consumer group Which? said Ryanair "regularly sits at the bottom" of its table ranking UK airlines, and only 
escaped "last place this year through the horrendous experience offered by Wizz Air".
But passengers have kept coming, attracted by low fares and its recent record of reliability. Ryanair did not sack 
staff during the pandemic, cutting their pay temporarily instead, and did not suffer from the disruption that blighted 
the rest of the industry last summer.
At about (EURO)16, the airline's shares have returned to their pre-pandemic levels but have easily outstripped 
rivals since the start of the crisis in 2020.
Chris Davies, an investment manager at Baillie Gifford, which is the thirdlargest investor in Ryanair, said the airline 
was "strategically remarkably consistent", adding: "They haven't really deviated very much from the core premise of 
bringing the unit costs down, bringing airfares down and taking market share."
Many within the industry agree and airlines are riding high off a remarkable bounceback in demand for travel.
Olivier Jankovec, head of airport industry body ACI Europe, said the shape of the pandemic recovery suited short-
haul airlines such as Ryanair, as leisure travellers had returned in higher numbers than business people.
He said Ryanair now wielded "a lot of market power", including demanding airports offer major discounts on landing 
fees as it rebuilt its routes following the pandemic.
"The impact is that it puts airports in competition with each other like never before ... I don't think it is good for the 
market or consumer," he said.
Prices have risen sharply over the past year as passenger demand for flying has returned, outstripping inflation, 
and O'Leary himself is among a clutch of senior industry executives to forecast the end of the super-cheap air fare.
Ryanair boss targets aviation passenger record O'Leary aims for 300mn annually, even though industry experts

One senior aviation executive said current industry forecasts for passenger numbers were based on old models that 
assumed that ever cheaper fares would drive growth.
Instead, the executive said structurally higher air fares could erode demand for flying, adding: "The truth is no one 
really knows now. We are in an entirely different world where air fares are www.rising.No one really knows what this 
means for demand."
The industry is also facing rising climate concerns, including paying higher carbon taxes as a system of free 
allowances is phased out under EU Emissions Trading Scheme, which analysts believe will raise fares further.
"Ryanair's business could be challenged by environmental legislation" that would potentially restrict routes and 
impose minimum pricing, analysts at Barclays said in a recent note assessing possible risks to the company.
Sébastien Thévoux-Chabuel, a portfolio manager at French asset manager Comgest, which is a top-15 shareholder 
in Ryanair, said: "Ryanair is the best operator in the sector. We see large market share for them to gain ... The only 
two questions remaining are how far are we on that journey of conquering new countries and what kind of impact 
will the cost of carbon have."
Ryanair's long-term passenger forecasts run into the next decade, and project forward to a future which might not 
involve the 62-year-old O'Leary, who has almost single-handedly dragged Ryanair from a bit part regional airline 
into a global aviation powerhouse. Few European corporates are as intimately linked to their chief executives as 
Ryanair is to O'Leary.
"Ryanair breathes MOL," said one former executive at the airline referring to O'Leary's initials. "It's one of those 
brands that has clearly imprinted its CEO's personality."
O'Leary's current contract runs out in 2028 and there are signs of succession planning as Ryanair has created a 
group structure, with him sitting at the top of a senior management team.
He said he had stepped back from managing every aspect of the business, and now largely worked on fleet 
development and funding. He was no longer as hands on with union talks, negotiations with airports or route 
planning, he said. "I think in the early days when we were turning this thing around ... I was the key man, it 
depended on me. I made all that decision. It's too big now," he said.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has vowed to push for breakneck growth and win more market share from 
rivals in Europe, as he presses ahead with a goal to double passenger numbers over the next decade.
The airline's ambitious new target to fly an annual 300mn passengers by 2034 would be more than any airline has 
yet managed in history. Even as the company bought 300 short-haul aircraft in a $40bn deal with Boeing earlier this 
month, some investors and analysts have questioned whether there are enough passengers left to carry in Europe, 
particularly at a time of rising climate concerns.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) on Monday said disruptions in the delivery of its order of 300 new aircraft from Boeing (BOE.L, 
BOEI.BR) may reduce its 10% traffic growth target for fiscal 2024.
The Irish low-cost carrier is aiming to service 185 million people but cautioned that the delays "may push some of 
this growth into the lower yielding" second half.
Despite the warning, Ryanair said it remains confident in achieving a modest year-over-year jump in profit and for a 
growth in revenue that is enough to cover the 1 billion-euro rise in its fuel bill.
Ryanair fell 3% at close of trading May 19, while Boeing rose marginally.

RYANAIR chief Michael O'Leary says the company will steal market share from European rivals, aiming to double 
passenger numbers to 300m per year within a decade.
O'Leary told the Financial Times: "I think the thesis that there's no more growth in Europe is wrong [and that] 
Europe is completely tapped out, is wrong.
"As long as we don't do something stupid - which is a daily challenge in this industry - we will continue to wipe the 
floor with every other airline in Europe."No airline has yet reached 300m passengers in one year, with industry 
experts sceptical about unbridled passenger growth given a basic lack of demand and broader constraints on the 
aviation industry through carbon taxes.
O'Leary did recognise a slowdown ahead, predicting Ryanair's growth will moderate at four to five per cent a year. 
But he stuck to a forecast for record passenger numbers and this month agreed a $40bn (£32.1bn) deal with 
Boeing for 300 new shorthaul aircraft.

Byline: Zacks Equity Research

May 22, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old 
investors, and Zacks Premium offers many different ways to do both. 
Featuring daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity 
Research reports, and Premium stock screens, the research service can help you become a smarter, more self-
assured investor. 
Zacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well. 
What are the Zacks Style Scores? 
The Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks 
based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances 
of beating the market over the next 30 days. 
Each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. 
Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the 
better chance the stock will outperform. 
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories: 
Value Score 
Value investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a 
stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value 
Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks. 
Growth Score 
Growth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength 
of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, 
and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time. 
Momentum Score 
Momentum traders and investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." This investing style is all about taking 
advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week 
price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate 
favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks. 
Here's Why Ryanair ( RYAAY ) is a Strong Momentum Stock
VGM Score 
If you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on 
their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, 
and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. 
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank 
A proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a 
company's earnings outlook, to help investors create a successful portfolio. 
It's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 
1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 
companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day. 
But it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks 
to choose from. 
That's where the Style Scores come in. 
To maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking 
stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a 
#3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible. 
As mentioned above, the Scores are designed to work with the Zacks Rank, so any change to a company's 
earnings outlook should be a deciding factor when picking which stocks to buy. 
Here's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still 
has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too. 
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better. 
Stock to Watch: Ryanair (RYAAY) 
Ryanair Holdings is the parent company of Ryanair Designated Activity Company (formerly known as Ryanair 
Limited). Ryanair, which commenced its flight operations in 1985, is based in headquartered in Swords, Ireland. 
RYAAY is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B. 
Momentum investors should take note of this Transportation stock. RYAAY has a Momentum Style Score of A, and 
shares are up 5.8% over the past four weeks. 
Two analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2023. The Zacks Consensus 
Estimate has increased $0.12 to $6.29 per share. RYAAY boasts an average earnings surprise of 7.5%. 
With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, RYAAY should be on investors' short list.

 Ryanair[1] hopes to grow passenger numbers in Financial Year 2024 by ten percent to around 185 million, up from 
168.6 million in FY23. But this will largely depend on new Boeing MAX 8200 deliveries being on time for the peak 
season. With the airframer expecting lower deliveries as it deals with the tailfin quality issue, Ryanair could receive 
aircraft outside the peak season, which could impact total passenger numbers by about one million. Ryanair could 
miss out on FY24 target if Boeing deliveries are late. 
The low-cost airline group that includes Ryanair, Buzz Air, Malta Air, and Lauda reported a €1.428 billion net profit 
attributable to shareholders compared to €-355 million net loss in FY22. The profit excludes a €114 million 
exceptional market-to-market loss on fuel caps. Ryanair's financial year covers March to March. 
While Q4 (January-March) produced a €-154 million net loss and Q1 was also 'disappointing' following a slump in 
air travel after the war in Ukraine, overall, FY23 was a strong year for Ryanair. Total revenues grew to €10.775 
billion from €4.801 billion. Passenger revenues were €6.930 billion, up from €2.653 billion. Ancillary revenues 
increased to €3.845 billion from €2.148 billion, or €23 per passenger. 
The airline group benefitted from 74 percent higher traffic and fares that were up by ten percent. Ryanair says that 
saw particularly strong growth in Italy, where it grew thirteen percent market share to forty percent. Poland jumped 
by ten percent to 36 percent, while Ireland was up by nine percent to 58 percent. The group operated at 116 
percent of pre-pandemic capacity. The load factor reached 93 percent, up from 82 percent in FY22. 
Fuel costs hedged eighty percent 
Operating expenses grew to €9.202 billion from €5.271 billion, with €130.5 million in exceptional fuel costs in FY23 
that in FY22 lowered the fuel bill by the same amount. Ex-fuel unit costs were €31. Fuel costs were 113 percent 
higher to €3.9 billion, the result of 52 percent more sectors flown and higher prices. Costs were offset by the better 
fuel efficiency of the MAX 8200s. The biggest gain of €1.4 billion came from hedging, which was eighty percent in 
FY23. The airline is already hedged 85 percent for FY24, but the bill is still expected to be €1.0 billion higher year 
on year. 
Staffing costs were 73 percent higher to €1.19 billion, also caused by ramping up capacity and the effect of the 
accelerated pay restoration that Ryanair promised it would do after the pandemic. The pre-exceptional operating 
profit was €1.573 billion, up from €-470.1 million in the previous year. 
Largest-ever summer schedule 
Ryanair could miss out on FY24 target if Boeing deliveries are late
Ryanair will operate its largest-ever schedule this summer, with 2.500 routes and 3.000 daily flights with over half a 
million passengers per day. Demand is expected to be still below pre-pandemic levels, but forward bookings are 
strong but remain close in. It repeated its forecast that travel in Europe will benefit from the return of passengers 
from North America and China[2]. Europe will continue to be affected by air traffic control issues, be it strikes are 
capacity constraints. With low visibility for HY2, Michael O'Leary said he expects only a modest growth of profit after 
tax for FY24.

Ryanair is expecting more modest growth from FY27, the year when it will introduce the Boeing MAX 10 into the 
fleet. (Ryanair) 
'The only cloud on our short-term horizon' is the Boeing delivery delays this summer. Ryanair is expecting to be ten 
aircraft short in May, June, and July as Boeing has to do rework on the tailfin fittings[3] of aircraft in production and 
inventory. This could cost Ryanair some 250.000 passengers each month. Boeing said that rework will affect Q2 
2023 deliveries, with aircraft pushed out into Q3. Ryanair has accepted that it will take new aircraft deliveries in July 
and possibly August too. The group grew the MAX 8200-fleet to 98 in FY23, which complements 411 737-800s and 
28 Airbus A320ceo's at Lauda. Lower deliveries reduced Capex by €450 million. The group has unfilled orders for 
112 MAX 8200s that will be delivered over the next three summers. 
MAX 10 order secures controlled growth 
As announced on May 9, Ryanairordered 150 MAX 10s[4] plus 150 options, with the first deliveries starting in 2027. 
This is subject to shareholder approval on September 14, but this is a formality. O'Leary said this huge order 
uniquely positions Ryanair for 'controlled growth in an environment in Europe when capacity will be constrained. () 
The order secures Ryanair's growth for the next decade while many of our competitors will be constrained not just 
by OEM delivery constraints but also by the very full order books.' He is counting on just two percent annual growth 
for some three years from FY27 instead of ten percent this year. 
As the first MAX 10 will join two years after the last MAX 8200 currently on order is delivered, Michael O'Leary 
expects them to be funded primarily from internal sources. However, the airline remains opportunistic in its 
financing options. 
Ryanair ended FY23 with €4.7 billion in cash. It repaid an €850 million bond in March and in May converted an 
unsecured €750 million syndicated term loan into a revolving credit facility at a lower margin that matures in 2028. 
In August, the group will repay a €750m maturing bond and fund over €2.6 billion of Capex for the incoming MAX 
8200s while retaining a broadly flat net cash/debt position. 'We will continue to preserve cash to minimize financing 
costs as we face considerable annual aircraft capex of over €2 billion per annum from 2027 onwards.'

The coming week ahead sees London's results season still rumbling on, with results from several income investor 
favourites, including Aviva and water companies Severn Trent and United Utilities.
There will also be a maiden update from Dowlais Group after its spin-out from Melrose, a debut for Avon 
Protection's new boss, a statement from another defence supplier QinetiQ, hope for a bottom-of-the-property-
market call from Great Portland Estates (LSE:GPOR), and maybe the same for Kingfisher and Johnson Matthey, 
the latter one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100 so far this year.
In macroeconomic news, UK inflation is the big number, coming on Wednesday, with other key data points being 
public sector borrowing and retail sales, while the new UK energy price cap will be announced on Thursday.
MONDAY 22 MAY
Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) will get things going on Monday as annual results from Michael O'Leary's 
company are expected to underline its status as the number one short-haul carrier in Europe.
Rivals have been uniformly upbeat in their recent updates and Ryanair will be no different, brokers predict.
With news that the cost-of-living and housing crises are driving record demand for self storage, results from Big 
Yellow Group PLC (LSE:BYG) will also be in focus. 
Aviva , Kingfisher, water companies Severn Trent and UU, defence contractors abound in week ahead
A January trading statement reported a "return to growth in net reservations and occupancy" as it moves into 
the seasonally stronger periods, with analysts at Peel Hunt saying the outlook from management will be the key to 
the prospects for the shares "and how the demand-supply dynamic for self-storage changes as the economy 
continues to battle high inflation".

TUESDAY 23 MAY
Tuesday is a day for new starts.
Dowlais Group PLC (LSE:DWL) will be presenting its maiden set of results as a separate company again after 
being spun out by Melrose earlier this year, five years after its hostile takeover of GKN.
Expect lots of talk about electric vehicles from chief executive Liam Butterworth, an experienced automotive 
operator. 
Over at Avon Protection PLC (LSE:AVON), new boss Jos Sclater took over in January, his first CEO job after being 
finance chief at Ultra Electronics.
He was also at GKN, coincidentally, being CFO for almost seven years, ended when the defence again Melrose 
ended in defeat.
Joining Avon after the helmet maker's dramatic rise and fall in recent years, Sclater is expected to set out more 
details on his strategy for the helmet maker.
Guidance for the full year is likely to be crucial, suggested broker Peel Hunt.

WEDNESDAY 24 MAY
UK inflation numbers will be the top-line news of the day, with some easing in the consumer price index expected 
but drops in some prices offset by soaraway groceries which may mean the overall number retreats more slowly 
than had been hoped.   
First quarter numbers from life insurer Aviva PLC (LSE:AV.) will be closely followed by its many loyal income 
investors. While they might be a fairly quiet affair there could be hints at further improvements later in the year, 
according to one analyst.
Forward guidance will also be scrutinised closely at Great Portland Estates (LSE:GPOR) as analysts at Barclays 
expect net asset value to have tracked lower but wondered if the bottom of the market might be called.
Representing the retail sector, B&Q and Screwfix owner Kingfisher PLC (LSE:KGF) is also expected to have 
endured a weak period.
Later, in the US, NVIDIA is also expected to report a drop in both earnings and revenue when it posts its results for 
the first quarter.

THURSDAY 25 MAY
Investors and households will be interested in what Ofgem has to say, as the regulator announces the new energy 
price cap for the July-September quarter, with a sizeable drop expected that will mean a big difference to many. 
Ahead of results from Johnson Matthey PLC (LSE:JMAT), forecasts were slashed by analysts due to falling 
platinum group metal (PGM) prices, though the group's clean air division is touted to see improvements in profit 
margins.
Also on Thursday there will be more riffing on the week's themes of water companies and defence suppliers.
Aviva , Kingfisher, water companies Severn Trent and UU, defence contractors abound in week ahead
QinetiQ Group PLC (LSE:QQ.) will follow Avon, though it was more bullish when it delivered its closing update on 
its financial year, upping its guidance, and leading analysts to expect "positive commentary on longer-term growth 
ambitions" when these preliminary results are reported.
Water company United Utilities Group PLC (LSE:UU.) may also be glowing proudly and hoping for pats on the back 
after the water industry's recent apology and promise to up spending investment in sewage processing and cutting 
leaks.
UU was one of the worst offenders, according to recent data, but most of its investors have not cared as the 
dividends it has paid out have been so lucrative in recent years.
Analysts at JPMorgan recently said investing in water companies could be viewed as "cheap" but returns are 
"unattractive" compared to electricity companies.

FRIDAY 26 MAY
It looks to be a quiet end to the week in terms of the City diary, with retail sales data from the Office for National 
Statistics helping bulk things up.
There will be an update from an investment trust whose shares are trading at one of the largest discounts to its net 
asset value, though its far from the largest.
Shares in HarbourVest (LSE:HVPE) Global Private Equity, managed by Boston-based HarbourVest (LSE:HVPE) 
Partners, closed the past week at 2,185p, which is a discount of over 43% to the last published NAV of £38.52 per

Highlight: With an unrivalled network of more than 3,000 daily flights, Ryanair has expanded its low-fare business 
travel service to the Amadeus Travel Platform.
Body
Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair announced an agreement with Amadeus Travel Platform with the aim to expand its 
low-fare corporate travel. Amadeus' B2B customer base can now book within a network of over 3,000 daily flights to 
over 235 destinations across 36 countries. According to Ryanair's 2022 annual report, they support unrivalled 
customer support with 90% on-time performance and aim to carry over 185 million customers in FY2023. Ryanair's 
Dara Brady highlighted the high-performance capabilities of Ryanair and how these will benefit the Amadeus 
platform: "We are pleased to now be live on the Amadeus Travel platform with Ryanair's unrivalled network of over 
3,000 flights to over 235 destinations, further expanding Ryanair's corporate travel offering and enabling corporate 
customers greater access to our market-leading network of routes, high frequencies, on-time performance and 
unbeatable low-cost fares. 
We look forward to working with Amadeus over the coming years as Ryanair grows to carry 225m passengers 
annually by FY26." This agreement is following on from a previous partnership between Amadeus and Ryanair from 
2014-2017. For both Ryanair and Amadeus' travel agency partners, the use of cutting-edge technology created 
especially for low-cost carriers simplifies operations. Jose-Luis Aragon, regional VP of air distribution Europe, 
Amadeus added how the technologies are allowing for a more systematic travel system: "We are very happy that 
Ryanair has chosen to capitalize on Amadeus' technology to support its distribution strategy. "With the integration of 
its content to the Amadeus Travel Platform, travel sellers and corporations will have a broader choice of travel 
options while benefiting from smooth and seamless integration into their everyday tools and processes." Along with 
the benefits of Ryanair's leading industry punctuality and company growth, it will also help Amadeus manage their 
carbon footprint with the lowest CO² emissions per passenger/km of any major European airline. This is an 
achievement underpinned by Ryanair's Pathway to Net Zero by 2050 decarbonisation strategy. Additionally, 
Michael O'Leary, Group CEO highlighted in the 2022 sustainability report the progress Ryanair has made in 
sustainability: "Over the last year, under the leadership of Thomas Fowler, our Director of Sustainability and 
Finance, we have made significant progress on our sustainability ambitions. This was independently recognised by 
Ryanair launches flights on Amadeus platform
the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project), giving us a B rating and Sustainalytics ranking us the no.1-rated large cap 
airline in the world and the no.1-rated airline in Europe."

The Irish budget airline has plans to expand its fleet by more than half by 2034 with the purchase of 300 Boeing 
Max-10 aircraft. Ryanair has spread its capacity throughout Spain, Italy and the UK. Investors have bid up the 
shares of airlines following the drop in fuel prices.
Airline passengers prefer aisle to window seats for ease of www.movement.No wonder. If Europe's airline bosses 
could safely jam more people on their planes, they would. Business is brisk, as easyJet affirmed in its interim report 
yesterday.
Its low-cost rival Ryanair is not taking this sitting down. This month it announced an order for another 300 Boeing 
737 Max-10 aircraft to swell its fleet to 675 planes by 2028 - one of the largest in Europe - a deal worth $40bn. 
Ryanair is already topranked in Europe (and fourth worldwide) for scheduled seats as of September last year. But is 
it saturating the regional market?
Ryanair says it needs these extra, more fuel-efficient Max-10s. With a fifth more seats than its current mainstay, the 
Boeing 737 NextGen (about 80 per cent of its fleet), the Max-10 should also burn a fifth less fuel. That thriftiness will 
matter as Ryanair has expanded its passenger target from 225mn by March 2026 to 300mn seven years later.
At (EURO)22 per available seat, jet fuel is expected to eat up 44 per cent of the airline's operating costs, Visible 
Alpha data says. Ryanair reports full-year results this month. Analysts expect that expense to climb towards 
(EURO)25 per seat in three years. Even so, Ryanair trumps its rivals on overall costs per passenger by no less than 
a third.
Ryanair : cruise liner Twitter : @FTLEX
This increased cost efficiency should keep earnings per share bubbling along. However, even at 225mn 
passengers, Ryanair is already a regional giant. Its (EURO)19bn market capitalisation almost equals the 
combination of its next two largest rivals, Lufthansa and British Airways owner IAG. Even with a large fleet, its 
capital spending should soon peak. That should result in steady free cash flow of about (EURO)2bn.
But the fleet growth could be deceptive. Without obvious acquisition targets, Ryanair could morph into a high-
yielding cash machine, thinks Bernstein.
It pays no dividend and has not bought back shares since the pandemic began, but all that could change. Formerly 
a pushy upstart, Ryanair is evolving comfortably into a middle-aged airline.

a pushy upstart, Ryanair is evolving comfortably into a middle-aged airline.

Highlight: Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair announced an agreement with Amadeus Travel Platform with the aim to 
expand its low-fare corporate travel.
Body
Amadeus' B2B customer base can now book within a network of over 3,000 daily flights to over 235 destinations 
across 36 countries. According to Ryanair's 2022 annual report, they support unrivalled customer support with 90% 
on-time performance and aim to carry over 185 million customers in FY2023. Ryanair's Dara Brady highlighted the 
high-performance capabilities of Ryanair and how these will benefit the Amadeus platform: "We are pleased to now 
be live on the Amadeus Travel platform with Ryanair's unrivalled network of over 3,000 flights to over 235 
destinations, further expanding Ryanair's corporate travel offering and enabling corporate customers greater access 
to our market-leading network of routes, high frequencies, on-time performance and unbeatable low-cost fares. We 
look forward to working with Amadeus over the coming years as Ryanair grows to carry 225m passengers annually 
by FY26." This agreement is following on from a previous partnership between Amadeus and Ryanair from 2014-
2017. For both Ryanair and Amadeus' travel agency partners, the use of cutting-edge technology created especially 
for low-cost carriers simplifies operations. 
Jose-Luis Aragon, regional VP of air distribution Europe, Amadeus added how the technologies are allowing for a 
more systematic travel system: "We are very happy that Ryanair has chosen to capitalize on Amadeus' technology 
to support its distribution strategy. "With the integration of its content to the Amadeus Travel Platform, travel sellers 
and corporations will have a broader choice of travel options while benefiting from smooth and seamless integration 
into their everyday tools and processes." Along with the benefits of Ryanair's leading industry punctuality and 
company growth, it will also help Amadeus manage their carbon footprint with the lowest CO² emissions per 
passenger/km of any major European airline. This is an achievement underpinned by Ryanair's Pathway to Net 
Zero by 2050 decarbonisation strategy. Additionally, Michael O'Leary, Group CEO highlighted in the 2022 
sustainability report the progress Ryanair has made in sustainability: "Over the last year, under the leadership of 
Thomas Fowler, our Director of Sustainability and Finance, we have made significant progress on our sustainability 
ambitions. This was independently recognised by the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project), giving us a B rating and 
Sustainalytics ranking us the no.1-rated large cap airline in the world and the no.1-rated airline in Europe."

Ryanair is expected to underline its status as the number one short-haul carrier in Europe when it reports annual 
results on Monday.
Rivals easyJet, Wizzair and even flagship carriers such as IAG, BA's owner, have been uniformly upbeat in their 
recent updates and Ryanair will be no different, brokers predict.
UBS see revenues at (EURO)10.9bn (consensus (EURO)10.7bn, 2022: (EURO)4.8bn) with net income at 
(EURO)1.45bn (Cons (EURO)1.39bn, 2022 -(EURO)355m).
"We think the company will continue to guide for 10% more traffic and continued growth in profits," said the broker.
Furthermore, the airline should guide for CASK (cost per seat) to be down so it is "conceivable that the company 
could be close to net debt neutrality".
Deutsche Bank recently upgraded its share price target to (EURO)20 on the basis that a bullish statement Monday 
will send the share price soaring.
In terms of passengers, Deutsche Bank sees 183mln travelling in 2024 (RYA target 185mln) a 2% increase from its 
earlier forecast and 202mln in 2025, up 4% from its previous target.
The Dublin-listed shares were trading at (EURO)16.18 on Friday.

 Will Ospreay says he hasn't heard about his being booked for AEW All In in Wembley Stadium, but he'd love to be 
on the show. Ospreay spoke with Fightful  for a new interview, and highlights about All In are below:
 On potentially being booked for All In: 'Oh, mate. Don't ask me, I stay in Essex. Go to South End, bruv. There's a 
little adventure island down there, lovely pier. I'd stay away from London. I say all the time, I f**king hate London. I 
can't be bothered with it. Nah, f**k it off. Go Essex.'
 On reports that he was booked for the show: 'I would love to know who said this. Because I didn't even f**king 
know. So this is all f**king news to me.'
 On England being a hotbed for Europe in terms of wrestling: 'It's f**king insane, isn't it? But I feel like our country, 
we're like the hotbed for Europe, personally. Because we get so many flights from even really shitty airlines like 
Stansted, Ryanair. We can go to every bit of Europe and you can come to England for like thirty quid. For 
Europeans, it's an easy place to get to. I feel like England's been starving for a real good pay-per-view quality. In 
reality we should have gotten a WrestleMania. We should have. Do you know what I mean? We should have. But 
it's nice that they're gonna give us a Money in the Bank. I think that's cute.'
 On AEW hosting All In in London: 'It's just mad that AEW's gone, 'f**k it, we'll do a stadium.' Even I was like, 'That's 
a big f**king ask.' But my God, if the rumors are true, 66,000 have been sold. That's insane. But I'm not surprised 
either because we've been starving for a good quality wrestling spectacular over here. If the rumors are true, and 
I'm apparently a part of it, I can't tell you how grateful I am. I really do mean it. I wrestled at Wembley Arena in 
Impact. f**king Mark Andrews got knocked out. So I had to look after his ass. But it's a f**king stadium, do you know 
what I mean? It's f**king crazy.'
 On Money in the Bank taking place in the UK: 'I hope so. Once again there clearly is the fan base here. They even 
done it with the NXT: UK. Now I don't know if there's a difference. Obviously I think fans kind of want to see John 
Will Ospreay Doesn't Know About Being Booked For AEW All In, Would Love To Be On It
Cena and Randy Orton and all those guys. But there's enough of a fan base and a market here to make an off 
brand. I think that's the good bit about it. Both companies are going balls to the wall. They're giving us Money in the 
Bank. I love Money in the Bank. CM Punk and Cena is one of my favorite f**king matches ever.'
 On All In being a stadium show: 'So it's so sick that they're doing that. I love the concept of the All In. I got a 
message from Cody ages ago, he said like, 'Why didn't you do All In?' I was like, 'Because you didn't f**king ask 
me.' He's like, 'I thought I did.' I'm like, 'No, you cunt. You didn't ask me.' 'I'm so sorry.' It says everything. All In is 
like gambling. It's about just going for it. 31 years ago we had British Bulldog and Bret Hart in Wembley and no one 
would ever think we would bring wrestling back there. Tony Khan's a madman going for it.'

British Airways owner IAG top pick as airline sector has 'headroom for further recovery'
British Airways owner IAG top pick as airline sector has 'headroom for 
further recovery'

There is still room for further airline earnings recovery, says broker Liberum, choosing British Airways 
owner International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (LSE:IAG) as the top pick.
Demand in the sector is proving "resilient, despite a weak macro outlook", with capacity on European routes looking 
"restrained relative to other regions".
On a day when holiday group On The Beach said the premium segment has been strong but volumes in the value 
segment have not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels due to cost-of-living pressures, analyst Gerald Khoo said 
constraints on the airline industry's ability to add excess capacity "are the main factor in the demand/supply balance 
remaining favourable" and capacity plans for the summer "remain sensible".
Furthermore, earnings estimates for the year are being supported by weaker fuel prices and a weaker US dollar 
that has amplified the benefit in euro and sterling terms.
"The lag in the restoration of capacity relative to the economic recovery should mean there is headroom for profits 
to continue to recover, despite a lacklustre macro outlook," the analyst added. 
IAG has a 'buy' recommendation from the broker and a target price of 350p, with the same 'buy' rating for easyJet 
PLC (LSE:EZJ) and its target upped to 690p from 650p, and also for Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA), with its 
target also hiked to (EURO)19 from (EURO)17.
British Airways owner IAG top pick as airline sector has 'headroom for further recovery'
The BA owner's relative share price performance has made its shares more attractive than the low-cost carriers, 
Khoo said. "Our concerns about leverage have moderated, but this is not reflected in the valuation."

 Europe's major airlines are calling on the European Commission to take measures to prevent the disruption of 
summer travel plans for millions of passengers caused by escalating industrial strikes.
Airline association Airlines for Europe, or A4E, said Tuesday that the European Commission should assist member 
states in implementing various measures, including mandatory arbitration prior to strike actions, a 21-day advance 
notice of strikes and a 72-hour individual notification of participation in industrial action.
In response to the demand, A4E member and Irish budget airline Ryanair (RYA.IR) initiated a petition to gather 1 
million signatures to pressure the commission to address the issue. 
The strikes have already resulted in over 3,000 flight cancellations and 23,000 delays, with more than 10 million 
passengers affected, Airlines for Europe said.

Potential Impact of Spanish Pilot Strikes on Multiple Airlines During Summer Season

Multiple airline's plans for the summer could be impacted if pilot strikes go ahead in Spain.
The Spanish Union of Airline Pilots (Sepla) is unhappy about "abusive minimum services" by the country's Ministry 
of Transport, Mobility and Urban Agenda (MITMA).
Airlines that could be dragged into the industrial dispute include Jet2, Norwegian, easyJet, Ryanair, Iberia, Vueling, 
Eurowings, Plus Ultra and Swift Air.
A press conference was called by Sepla on May 12, 2023, where the union expresses concern that strikes by Air 
Nostrum and Air Europa were being restricted by minimum service requirements.
Sepla's secretary, Javier Fernández-Picazo, has warned that workers in the aviation sector are tired of enduring 
mistreatment by the Spanish government.
Fernández-Picazo also added that no decision had been finalized but industrial action "is on the table".
The union hinted additional workers from the aviation sector, such as cabin crew and air traffic controllers, could be 
pulled into the strikes.
According to the Daily Mail on May 8, Sepla announced eight new strike days at Air Europa for May 22, 23, 25, 26, 
29 and 30 and June 1 and 2 in Spain.
It is thought that more than 100 million tourists visit Spain each year, many relying on airlines and particularly during 
the summer season.
In the United States pilots at Southwest Airlines and American Airlines have voted overwhelmingly to authorize 
strike action.

Boeing 's April Delivery Decline Sparks New Deals

Boeing stock price 
Shares of Boeing (NYSE: BA)  seemed to hold up against broader market volatility during Friday's trading session. 
On a day when the S&P 500 benchmark declined by as much as 1.2%, Boeing stock only refused to close the day 
with a soft decline of 0.56%. The relative strength comes from the company announcing recent aircraft orders, 
which accrue to management's plan to deliver four hundred to four hundred and fifty 737 MAX models. Achieving 
these outlooks would set investor expectations to receive news of three to five billion dollars in free cash flow, 
further fueling dividend payouts and share repurchase allocations. 
Management has landed recent deals with companies like Ryanair (NASDAQ: RYAAY)  and Qatar Airways. In 
addition, there is a pending demand boost now that Chinese citizens and foreign nationals have resumed travel. As 
orders are bottoming after an alarming decline in April 2023, and the global travel and defense industries seem to 
rebound, management seems confident about achieving its long-term targets for 2025-2026. Analysts agree with 
the probability of such targets being met as a current double-digit upside potential is assigned to the stock. Building 
Momentum
Boeing's cash flow product line, the 737 MAX jet, is set to experience a production output boost as management 
feels the heat of pent-up demand awakening. As a result, investors can take notice of a 32% increase in 737 
deliveries in the first quarter  of 2023 compared to a year prior, implying that the company may be on track to meet 
its year-end expectations. 
In addition, Boeing posted 737 deliveries  of three hundred and eighty-seven airplanes for 2022, indicating an 
expected 3.3% to 16.3% growth rate for the year-end 2023. Of course, these expectations would only be set, much 
less met, if a decent backlog reflected demand. 
After reporting a manufacturing defect  in its 737 MAX product line, Boeing posted total of April 2023 deliveries of 
the jet line to be 26 in total, a more than 50% decline from those delivered a month prior. Postponing some of the 
pending deliveries may have been an unexpected event, though it worked like a charm in favor of ensuing demand 
when carriers realized the real need at hand for counting with a sufficiently large aircraft network. In an interview, 
Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun revealed that Ryanair had placed an order of forty billion dollars in value. Additionally, 
Calhoun stated  optimistically, "The market is coming back; it's exploding. So am I reasonably confident? Yes," 
pointing to developments in the Chinese market for new carriers. 
Boeing 's April Delivery Decline Sparks New Deals
On a different front, though still accruing to the company's optimistic financial outlooks, is the new Pentagon  order 
for CH-47F Chinook helicopters. A potential deal for these items could represent up to eight billion five hundred 
million, showcasing that not only the rebound in the travel industry matters.  A New Frontier, Same Upside 
The quietly awakening Chinese economy seems to be missing in Boeing's analyst ratings , which subsequently 
represents an unprecedented opportunity to capitalize on closing the gap on 2023 outlooks. Boeing's financials  will 
show that the company is operating at an excess of 52% capacity utilization, up from less than 30% only three 
years prior. This increasing capacity utilization, attributed to growing orders from various carriers, has made China 
realize it had better get its fair share of output before it chokes out again. 
As Chinese officials face a tipping point in the economy, new orders for the best-selling 737 MAX Bay be imminent. 
In addition, China's manufacturing PMI , a proxy for economic growth which ultimately leads to GDP growth, stood 
at 53.6% for the month of April. With any reading above 50% implying economic growth, a significant disconnect 
exists between these bullish readings and the nation's lackluster inflation  rates of 0.1% for the same month. The 
gap can be filled, as speculated by some analysts , ultimately by direct fiscal stimulus providing buying power for 
consumers and enterprises alike.  
Boeing's price-to-book value trades at its lowest levels in a decade. Today's book value multiple is a mere 1.6x 
when Boeing has historically traded between 5.0x to 6.0x. In addition, there has been some book value 
deterioration. The business saw the need to increase debt levels and issue shares due to negative cash flow. 
However, the future seems a lot brighter as management points to largely positive free cash flow levels and 
continuedly improving fundamentals. 
All of these developments could significantly drive book value per share forward, especially reinstating a share 
repurchase program; this way, investors have the best of both tailwinds. On one side, the company's retained 
earnings and share repurchases will naturally drive book value upward; on the other, the company's multiple is 
severely compressed and could see a bump once sentiment in the industry improves.

Sarah Ketterer's Causeway Buys UBS, Sells Booking in 1st Quarter
Sarah Ketterer's Causeway Buys UBS, Sells Booking in 1st Quarter

May 15th, 2023 ( GuruFocus.com  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Sarah Ketterer  ( Trades , Portfolio ), the CEO and fundamental portfolio manager of Causeway Capital 
Management, recently released the firm's 13F portfolio updates for the first quarter of 2023, which ended on March 
31.
 Causeway Capital Management was founded in 2001 by Ketterer and Harry Hartford. The Los Angeles-based firm 
chooses stocks from among large and mid-cap companies in developed markets around the world. Their screens 
use quantitative, value-oriented metrics and a 'risk score' to find potential investment opportunities. After screening, 
the investment team chooses the stocks that have the most favorable risk-adjusted returns, price-earnings ratios 
and dividend yields.
 Based on its latest 13F report, the firm's top trades of the quarter included a new buy for UBS Group AG ( 
UBS ,  Financial ), an addition to Ryanair Holdings PLC (  RYAAY  ,  Financial ), the sale of its Booking Holdings 
Inc. (  BKNG  ,  Financial ) position and a reduction in Las Vegas Sands Corp. (  LVS  ,  Financial ).
 Investors should be aware 13F reports do not provide a complete picture of a guru's holdings. They include only a 
snapshot of long equity positions in U.S.-listed stocks and American depository receipts as of the quarter's end. 
They do not include short positions, non-ADR international holdings or other types of securities. However, even this 
limited filing can provide valuable information.
 UBS Group 
 The firm established a new holding worth 9,650,640 shares in UBS Group ( 
UBS ,  Financial ), giving it a 4.89% weight in the equity portfolio at the quarter's average share price of $20.86.
 UBS Group is the largest banking institution in Switzerland and the largest private bank in the world, offering a 
range of investment banking and other financial services. On March 19, UBS Group announced it would acquire 
fellow Swiss bank major Credit Suisse ( 
Sarah Ketterer's Causeway Buys UBS, Sells Booking in 1st Quarter
CS ,  Financial ) for $3.3 billion after its near-collapse in a deal negotiated with regulators.
 The shotgun merger will take effort, but UBS claims confidence that it will be valuable for shareholders, with 
potential synergies including cost savings and favorable asset sales. The GF Value  chart rates the stock as fairly 
valued at Friday's share price of $19.16.
 Ryanair Holdings 
 Causeway upped its stake in Ryanair Holdings ( 
RYAAY ,  Financial ) by 20.07% for a total position of 9,242,910 shares, adding 3.49% to the equity portfolio. During 
the quarter, shares averaged $92.30 apiece.
 Ryanair Holdings is a holding company for a family of airlines and adjacent companies, including Ryanair DAC, 
Ryanair UK, Buzz, Malta Air and Lauda. It also provides travel insurance and accommodation services.
 Ryanair's revenue and earnings tanked due to the pandemic and have struggled to recover, much like other airline 
companies. It is in the process of recovery, though, and has returned to profitability with a price-earnings ratio  of 
16.53. The GF Value chart  rates the stock as a possible value trap due to the decline in profitability and share 
price, but with a financial strength  rank of 6 out of 10, the company likely has what it takes to weather the storm.
 Booking Holdings 
 The firm sold all 31,513 of its shares of Booking Holdings ( 
BKNG ,  Financial ), which previously took up 1.84% of the equity portfolio. Shares traded for an average price of 
$2,433.33 during the quarter.
 Based in Norwalk, Connecticut, Booking Holdings is a world leader in online travel services, providing booking 
services for everything from flights and cars to hotels and vacation packages. The company's focus is mainly on the 
more fragmented European and Asian hotel markets rather than the U.S. market.
 Following Booking's stellar rebound from pandemic-driven travel pauses, investors are worrying about early signs 
of a new slowdown in travel, which can likely be attributed to inflation and a brewing economic downturn. Analysts 
are still projecting long-term growth for now, resulting in a modestly undervalued rating from the GF Value chart  for 
the stock.
 Las Vegas Sands 
 Causeway reduced its investment in Las Vegas Sands ( 
LVS ,  Financial ) by 78.19%, leaving a remaining holding of 282,413 shares and trimming 1.42% off the equity 
portfolio. During the quarter, shares traded for an average price of $55.99.
 A Nevada-based casino and resort company, Las Vegas Sands has been undergoing a bold transformation 
strategy. Following its Covid-related financial struggles, it has finally finished divesting all of its U.S. casinos and 
convention centers to focus on Macau and Singapore, which it believes will be higher-growth regions. It began the 
shift out of the U.S. in the early 2000s, breaking into the Macau casino scene to develop the so-called 'Las Vegas of 
Asia.'
 The company's ambitions may be lofty, but Ebitda has declined an average of 56% per year for the past three 
years, which is a lot for investors to digest. The GF Value chart  rates the stock as fairly valued.

,  Financial ).
 As of the quarter's end, Causeway Capital Management held positions in 81 stocks in a 13F portfolio valued at 
$4.17 billion. The turnover for the period was 21%.
 The firm's top holding was Ryanair with 20.90% of the equity portfolio, followed by Canadian National Railway with 
13.38% and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. ( 
TSM ,  Financial ) with 6.10%.
 In terms of sector weighting, the firm was most invested in industrials, technology and consumer cyclical stocks.

Boeing 's April Delivery Decline Sparks New Deals

May 15th, 2023 ( MarketBeat  — Delivered by  Newstex )
 Shares of Boeing NYSE: BA  seemed to hold up against broader market volatility during Friday's trading session. 
On a day when the S&P 500 benchmark declined by as much as 1.2%, Boeing stock only refused to close the day 
with a soft decline of 0.56%. The relative strength comes from the company announcing recent aircraft orders, 
which accrue to management's plan to deliver four hundred to four hundred and fifty 737 MAX models. Achieving 
these outlooks would set investor expectations to receive news of three to five billion dollars in free cash flow, 
further fueling dividend payouts and share repurchase allocations.
 Management has landed recent deals with companies like Ryanair NASDAQ: RYAAY  and Qatar Airways. In 
addition, there is a pending demand boost now that Chinese citizens and foreign nationals have resumed travel. As 
orders are bottoming after an alarming decline in April 2023, and the global travel and defense industries seem to 
rebound, management seems confident about achieving its long-term targets for 2025-2026. Analysts agree with 
the probability of such targets being met as a current double-digit upside potential is assigned to the stock.
 Building Momentum
 Boeing's cash flow product line, the 737 MAX jet, is set to experience a production output boost as management 
feels the heat of pent-up demand awakening. As a result, investors can take notice of a 32% increase in 737 
deliveries in the first  quarter  of 2023 compared to a year prior, implying that the company may be on track to meet 
its year-end expectations.
 In addition, Boeing posted 737 deliveries  of three hundred and eighty-seven airplanes for 2022, indicating an 
expected 3.3% to 16.3% growth rate for the year-end 2023. Of course, these expectations would only be set, much 
less met, if a decent backlog reflected demand.
 After reporting a manufacturing  defect  in its 737 MAX product line, Boeing posted total of April 2023 deliveries of 
the jet line to be 26 in total, a more than 50% decline from those delivered a month prior. Postponing some of the 
pending deliveries may have been an unexpected event, though it worked like a charm in favor of ensuing demand 
when carriers realized the real need at hand for counting with a sufficiently large aircraft network. In an interview, 
Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun revealed that Ryanair had placed an order of forty billion dollars in value. Additionally, 
Boeing 's April Delivery Decline Sparks New Deals
Calhoun stated optimistically, "The market is coming back; it's exploding. So am I reasonably confident? Yes," 
pointing to developments in the Chinese market for new carriers.
 On a different front, though still accruing to the company's optimistic financial outlooks, is the new Pentagon  order 
for CH-47F Chinook helicopters. A potential deal for these items could represent up to eight billion five hundred 
million, showcasing that not only the rebound in the travel industry matters. 
 A New Frontier, Same Upside 
 The quietly awakening Chinese economy seems to be missing in  Boeing's analyst ratings , which subsequently 
represents an unprecedented opportunity to capitalize on closing the gap on 2023 outlooks.  Boeing's financials  will 
show that the company is operating at an excess of 52% capacity utilization, up from less than 30% only three 
years prior. This increasing capacity utilization, attributed to growing orders from various carriers, has made China 
realize it had better get its fair share of output before it chokes out again.
 As Chinese officials face a tipping point in the economy, new orders for the best-selling 737 MAX Bay be imminent. 
In addition, China's manufacturing  PMI , a proxy for economic growth which ultimately leads to GDP growth, stood 
at 53.6% for the month of April. With any reading above 50% implying economic growth, a significant disconnect 
exists between these bullish readings and the nation's lackluster  inflation  rates of 0.1% for the same month. The 
gap can be filled, as speculated by some  analysts , ultimately by direct fiscal stimulus providing buying power for 
consumers and enterprises alike. 
 Boeing's price-to-book value trades at its lowest levels in a decade. Today's book value multiple is a mere 1.6x 
when Boeing has historically traded between 5.0x to 6.0x. In addition, there has been some book value 
deterioration. The business saw the need to increase debt levels and issue shares due to negative cash flow. 
However, the future seems a lot brighter as management points to largely positive free cash flow levels and 
continuedly improving fundamentals.
 All of these developments could significantly drive book value per share forward, especially reinstating a share 
repurchase program; this way, investors have the best of both tailwinds. On one side, the company's retained 
earnings and share repurchases will naturally drive book value upward; on the other, the company's multiple is 
severely compressed and could see a bump once sentiment in the industry improves.

LOGISTICS 
 Ryanair, the Irish ultra low-cost carrier, has ordered 300 new Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircrafts (150 firm and 150 
options) for delivery between 2027 to 2033. When finalised, and subject to all options being exercised, this deal is 
valued at over $40 billion at current prices and is the largest order ever placed by an Irish company for the US 
manufactured goods.
 Boeing's new fuel efficient B737-MAX-10 aircraft have 228 seats (21 per cent more than the B737NG) and the 
phased deliveries between 2027 and 2033 will enable Ryanair to create more than 10,000 new high-paid jobs. 
Ryanair expects 50 per cent of these deliveries will replace older B737NGs, which will allow Ryanair to continue to 
operate one of Europe's youngest, fuel efficient and environmentally sustainable aircraft fleets.

Airbus and Boeing, two leading aircraft producers, are facing difficulties keeping up with the surging demand for 
new jets as airlines eagerly continue to purchase aircraft. Despite obstacles stemming from the pandemic, both 
companies have amassed billions of dollars' worth of new orders, extending well into the 2030s, propelled by the 
ongoing recovery of the air travel industry.
Several airlines, including Air India, Ryanair, and a newly established national carrier in Saudi Arabia, have placed 
firm or provisional orders for a total of 700 jets from Airbus and Boeing.
Adding to the momentum, Turkish Airlines recently made a surprise announcement, revealing plans to order 600 
jets in June. This deal marks the fourth major agreement in just a few months, surpassing Air India's record-
breaking order for 470 Airbus and Boeing aircraft.
Industry experts note that Turkey's national carrier aims to position itself as a mega-connector airline, linking 
Europe, Asia, and Africa. This strategic move intensifies competition for connecting traffic between Istanbul's hub 
and other major centers in Europe and the Middle East.
While the timing of the announcement, just days before Turkey's elections, raised eyebrows, analysts also 
highlighted the simultaneous emphasis on strategic aerospace projects, including fighters, attack helicopters, and 
drones.
The magnitude of such an order may become entangled in broader political discussions, caution Jefferies analysts, 
citing Turkey's objection to Sweden joining NATO.
Despite potential political implications, analysts view Turkish Airlines' announcement as a robust statement of 
intent. Airlines are taking proactive steps to regain market share in the post-pandemic era, showing a willingness to 
act without waiting for global supply chains to stabilize.
With its newly inaugurated $12 billion airport, Istanbul is considered a geographically advantageous location to 
challenge major hubs in Dubai and Doha.
Airlines Anticipate Shortage, Triggering Jet Order Boom
According to Turkish Airlines Chairman Ahmet Bolat, the order will include 200 long-haul jets and 400 smaller 
narrow-body aircraft to accommodate the anticipated traffic. The airline's current fleet is split between Airbus and 
Boeing aircraft.
The pressure to act promptly is evident, as Ryanair's CEO recently admitted to paying higher prices to secure 
narrow-body aircraft later in the decade due to limited supply.
However, concerns have been raised regarding multiple airlines purchasing planes to cater to the same travel 
demand, potentially leading to an oversupply that could impact industry profits.
Placing orders years in advance also carries the risk of inflation, with escalation clauses potentially increasing the 
value of large orders by the time the planes are delivered. Only airlines with strict cost controls or strong political 
support can afford such exposure.
This surge in orders occurs at a time when airlines face mounting pressure to reduce emissions. Critics argue that 
ordering current-generation planes years ahead could divert attention from the development of the next generation 
of single-aisle jets, expected to be available in the mid- to late-2030s.
Planemakers counter that the currently sold jets already offer significantly improved fuel efficiency compared to their 
predecessors, leveraging the benefits of new fuels crucial for achieving the industry's net-zero targets by 2050.
However, some strategists interpret the current order surge as an effort by rapidly expanding airlines to advance 
their purchases of current-generation jets, anticipating a shortage leading up to technological advancements.
While the industry argues that this aligns with their net-zero strategies due to the efficiency of the aircraft, critics 
emphasize that these planes will still be in service in 2050, limiting the scope for fuel improvements in the interim.

Come fly first class with me On life support during Covid-19, airlines are seeing a boom in premium travel
Come fly first class with me; On life support during Covid-19, airlines are 
seeing a boom in premium travel

One of the bold predictions made in the dark days of the first Covid-19 lockdown was that air travel would never be 
the same again. Once executives discovered it was perfectly possible to hold meetings with counterparts across the 
globe via Zoom, business travel - from which many airlines derived the bulk of their income - would surely never 
fully recover; companies would balk at paying for pricey air tickets and hotels. As travel collapsed, many airlines 
were kept alive by bailouts. Hundreds of aircraft were parked in the Arizona desert.
Things have turned out rather differently. Monthly air passenger numbers are virtually back to pre-pandemic levels. 
But demand is recovering fastest in the premium segment - driven not by business travellers but by leisure.
Lufthansa chief Carsten Spohr said this week that his team's urgings to expand first class were something he 
"never thought I would hear". Air France-KLM says high-end leisure travellers are more than offsetting reduced 
corporate travel. The three biggest US carriers told investors last month passengers were eager to book seats at 
the front of the plane.
The recovery is not only in first and business class. Low-cost Ryanair this week struck a deal to buy up to 300 
Boeing aircraft. With demand close to outstripping supply amid a backlog of new planes, and labour and fuel costs 
soaring, air fares are rising at twice the rate of inflation. The struggle by airlines and airports to accommodate the 
surge led over the past year to delays, cancellations, and falling customer satisfaction levels. But that, in turn, may 
be pushing middle-class customers to upgrade their seats in search of a better experience - even, in some cases, 
at the cost of shortening their trips.
Come fly first class with me On life support during Covid-19, airlines are seeing a boom in premium travel
One factor driving the wanderlust is "revenge travel" - the urge to make up for foregone trips, funded by savings 
accumulated during lockdown. Then there is "bleisure", the growing tendency for those who are still travelling on 
business to tack leisure time on the end, and take partners with them.
The wealthy seem particularly seized by the post-Covid "you only live once" or "yolo" mentality: a readiness to 
splash money on goods and experiences today, not hoard it for an uncertain tomorrow. The same phenomenon is 
reflected in the surge in luxury cars, watches and handbags. France's LVMH recently became Europe's first $500bn 
company, its founder Bernard Arnault overtaking Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos as the world's richest person. Indeed, 
the super-rich never really gave up travelling in the pandemic, driving a boom in the private jet industry.
Some airlines now foresee a permanent shift towards holidaymakers filling first and business class cabins. When 
those berths sell for many multiples of economy prices it is understandable for the likes of Lufthansa, Qantas and 
Etihad to be rushing to expand premium cabins with options including extrawide beds and UHD televisions.
Yet this seems an uncertain long-term bet. The US luxury boom is slowing, and the urge for "revenge travel" may 
wane along with Covid-era savings. Climate concerns may once again start to intrude. And some in the industry 
concede that, after 40 years of falling fares, no one quite knows what today's rising ticket prices may mean for 
future demand, or where the ceiling is.
The history of the air travel business is that when demand booms, supply eventually catches up - and returns are 
pummelled. Delays in delivering new planes are slowing that cycle today, but future order books are bulging. 
Lufthansa's Spohr quipped in March that current high yields were "just too much fun". After their near-death 
experience during Covid, airlines may need to enjoy them while they last.

Come fly first class with me On life support during Covid-19, airlines are seeing a boom in premium travel
Come fly first class with me; On life support during Covid-19, airlines are 
seeing a boom in premium travel

One of the bold predictions made in the dark days of the first Covid-19 lockdown was that air travel would never be 
the same again. Once executives discovered it was perfectly possible to hold meetings with counterparts across the 
globe via Zoom, business travel - from which many airlines derived the bulk of their income - would surely never 
fully recover; companies would balk at paying for pricey air tickets and hotels. As travel collapsed, many airlines 
were kept alive by bailouts. Hundreds of aircraft were parked in the Arizona desert.
Things have turned out rather differently. Monthly air passenger numbers are virtually back to pre-pandemic levels. 
But demand is recovering fastest in the premium segment - driven not by business travellers but by leisure.
Lufthansa chief Carsten Spohr said this week that his team's urgings to expand first class were something he 
"never thought I would hear". Air France-KLM says high-end leisure travellers are more than offsetting reduced 
corporate travel. The three biggest US carriers told investors last month passengers were eager to book seats at 
the front of the plane.
The recovery is not only in first and business class. Low-cost Ryanair this week struck a deal to buy up to 300 
Boeing aircraft. With demand close to outstripping supply amid a backlog of new planes, and labour and fuel costs 
soaring, air fares are rising at twice the rate of inflation. The struggle by airlines and airports to accommodate the 
surge led over the past year to delays, cancellations, and falling customer satisfaction levels. But that, in turn, may 
be pushing middle-class customers to upgrade their seats in search of a better experience - even, in some cases, 
at the cost of shortening their trips.
Come fly first class with me On life support during Covid-19, airlines are seeing a boom in premium travel
One factor driving the wanderlust is "revenge travel" - the urge to make up for foregone trips, funded by savings 
accumulated during lockdown. Then there is "bleisure", the growing tendency for those who are still travelling on 
business to tack leisure time on the end, and take partners with them.
The wealthy seem particularly seized by the post-Covid "you only live once" or "yolo" mentality: a readiness to 
splash money on goods and experiences today, not hoard it for an uncertain tomorrow. The same phenomenon is 
reflected in the surge in luxury cars, watches and handbags. France's LVMH recently became Europe's first $500bn 
company, its founder Bernard Arnault overtaking Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos as the world's richest person. Indeed, 
the super-rich never really gave up travelling in the pandemic, driving a boom in the private jet industry.
Some airlines now foresee a permanent shift towards holidaymakers filling first and business class cabins. When 
those berths sell for many multiples of economy prices it is understandable for the likes of Lufthansa, Qantas and 
Etihad to be rushing to expand premium cabins with options including extrawide beds and UHD televisions.

wane along with Covid-era savings. Climate concerns may once again start to intrude. And some in the industry

Ryanair and CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric (GE) Aviation and Safran Aircraft Engines, 
signed a deal for engines to power the Irish low-cost carrier's recent order of 150 Boeing 737 MAX-10 aircraft.
Ryanair and CFM International signed a Letter of Agreement (LoA) to purchase enough LEAP 1-B engines to power 
150 Boeing 737 MAX-10 aircraft ordered on May 9, 2023. According to CFM International's announcement, the LoA 
also includes spare engines and options for 150 additional aircraft and respective engines.
"We are honored by Ryanair's renewed trust in our products and in our teams. We look forward to continuing to 
support Ryanair's fleet development by providing them with the best standards in terms of reliability, sustainability 
and maintenance," said Gaël Méheust, the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of CFM International.
The LEAP 1-B engine is the only power plant option for the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft family, including the 737 MAX-
7, MAX-8, MAX-9, and MAX-10. CFM International also builds the LEAP 1-A and LEAP 1-AC that power the Airbus 
A320neo aircraft family and China's COMAC C919.
Ryanair announced the order for 300 Boeing 737 MAX-10 aircraft, including 150 firm and 150 options, on May 9, 
2023. The deal, valued at $40 billion at list prices, will see the airline receive the aircraft between 2023 and 2027, 
marking the largest aircraft order in Ryanair history.
As of April 30, 2023, Boeing has delivered 102 aircraft of the type to Ryanair and has 108 orders that are yet to be 
fulfilled, excluding the 300-strong aircraft order. Ryanair currently operates 103 Boeing 737 MAX-8200 aircraft, 
according to ch-aviation.com data.
The order will help the low-cost carrier secure aircraft for its future growth and renew its fleet, with Ryanair aiming to 
carry 225 million annual passengers by FY2026.

 Uber users opening the app for a quick ride home after a late night out partying better start paying attention to what 
button they press.
 On Wednesday, Uber announced its UK users will be able to book both domestic and international flights in its app 
by this summer as part of its ambition to create a "super app," per  the Financial Times. Uber's UK general manager 
Andrew Brem said in a statement the booking process will take "as little as one minute."
 Uber Everything 
 Even before it got into the airline business, Uber was flying high. It reported its first-ever positive cash flow in 
August 2022, and since then it has managed to skirt the enormous job cuts  which have afflicted other tech 
companies -- although it did announce in February that it would shed  some employees via "even more rigorous" 
performance reviews. So rest assured that Uber employees have really been gunning for 5 stars lately.
 In a surprisingly comfortable position, and having added a hefty string to its bow with food-delivery product 
UberEats, Uber is now using the UK as a testing ground for integrating itself into a wider transport infrastructure:
 Uber has already added features to its UK app to let users book train and bus tickets, and Brem told the FT that 
train reservations have gone up 40% month-on-month since they launched in August last year. He didn't, however, 
provide any hard figures and given the UK has been ravaged by train strikes since June last year, maybe he'd 
rather not say.
 To sell plane tickets, Uber is co-piloting with travel booking site Hopper. Uber will take a commission on each sale, 
and has the option to add booking fees in the future if the feature really takes off.
Uber Launches Flight-Booking Product in the UK
 Many Silicon Valley firms want to enmesh themselves into critical infrastructures like payment, transport, and 
communication. Elon Musk announced upon buying Twitter that he wanted to make the social app into an 
"everything app," and Meta has integrated its payment system "Meta Pay" (formerly Facebook Pay) into its roster of 
apps.
 Bye Bye Birdie: While Twitter pursues "everything app" status, it may be losing its title as Corporate America's 
unofficial customer service desk. Airlines including Ryanair have announced this month that they won't answer 
customer service questions on Twitter anymore. And it's not just because people were less than kind to them on a 
platform not especially known for its sweetness and light. The Wall Street Journal  reported  this was a 
consequence of the chaos surrounding the platform's blue check marks, meaning some unverified airlines fear their 
accounts could be easily mimicked. Fliers will have to find another way to publicly shame airlines into answering 
their questions while stranded in an airport.

Ryanair wins suit over state aid for Lufthansa Airlines
Ryanair wins suit over state aid for Lufthansa; Airlines

Ryanair has won a European court case against the EU's decision to grant Lufthansa billions of euros in state aid to 
help the German carrier during the pandemic, in a major setback to regulators in Brussels.
The General Court that checks Brussels' rules said the European Commission made "several errors" and it was 
wrong to consider that Lufthansa "was unable to obtain financing on the markets for the entirety of its needs".
EU regulators approved (EURO)6bn in state aid to help Lufthansa as Berlin sought to acquire a 20 per cent stake in 
the bloc's largest airline to prevent its collapse. Carsten Spohr, Lufthansa's chief executive, said then the original 
planned bailout exceeded what it needed, drawing further scrutiny on regulators.
Under state aid rules companies cannot receive more than the amount necthe essary to keep trading without 
skewing competition. Since then, Lufthansa said it had repaid or cancelled all remaining government support given 
in aid during the Covid-19 crisis.
The ruling is a blow for EU regulators and not the first time that Brussels has lost a court case over government aid 
to companies. In July 2020, the General Court quashed an order for Apple to pay back (EURO)14.3bn in taxes to 
Ireland.
"It's a very hard-hitting ruling against commission," said Alec Burnside, a partner at law firm Dechert.
Ryanair wins suit over state aid for Lufthansa Airlines
"The commission has had to work at breakneck speed during Covid. They really mobilised to allow member states 
to do what was necessary to save important players," he said, and state aid rules were applied in haste during the 
crisis.
Lufthansa said it would decide on further action. It said it had already fully repaid the bailout funds agreed by 
Brussels, as well as about (EURO)92mn in interest.
Lufthansa said the government body that arranged the bailout, the Economic Stabilisation Fund, had sold its shares 
in the carrier for (EURO)1bn. "The stabilisation was thus already fully terminated before today's court ruling," it 
added.
Ryanair said the judgment confirmed "that the commission must act as a guardian of the level playing field in air 
transport". Brussels said it would "re- flect on possible next steps". It is unclear whether it will appeal to the 
European Court of Justice, the EU's highest court.

 Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[1] may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up 
quite nicely for their report. 
That is because Ryanair is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a 
precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date 
information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for RYAAY in this 
report. 
In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 94 cents per share for RYAAY, 
narrower than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 99 cents per share. This suggests that analysts 
have very recently bumped up their estimates for RYAAY, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +5.05% 
heading 
into 
earnings 
season.

Ryanair Holdings PLC price-eps-surprise[2] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[3] Why is this Important? A positive 
reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and 
outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a 
Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on 
average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here[4]). 
Given that RYAAY has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock 
ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[5]. 
Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Ryanair, and that a beat might 
be in the cards for the upcoming report.

 In the past week, Copa Holdings CPA[1] reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues for first-
quarter 2023, driven by the upbeat air-travel demand scenario. First-quarter earnings-related updates were 
discussed in theprevious write-up[2]as well. 
Driven by the buoyant passenger-volume scenario, another Latin American carrier Gol Linhas GOL[3] reported rosy 
traffic numbers for the month of February. European carrier, Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[4] April traffic report was 
impressive as well. An update on fleet modernization was also available from Ryanair. Meanwhile, United Airlines 
UAL[5] expanded its code-sharing agreement with Azul AZUL[6] in a customer-friendly move. Recap of the Latest 
Top Stories 1 Copa Holdings' first-quarter 2023 earnings (excluding 92 cents from non-recurring items) of $3.99 per 
share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.34 androse more than 100% year over year. Revenues of 
$867.3 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $839.1 million and improved 51.7% year over year on the 
back of passenger revenues. 
Passenger revenues (contributed 96.2% to the top line) increased 28.5% from first-quarter 2019 levels, owing to 
higher yields (up 20%). Cargo and mail revenues jumped 51.8% from first-quarter 2019 actuals to $23.25 million, 
owing to higher cargo volumes and yields. Other operating revenues improved 24% to $10 million, owing to 
revenues from non-air ConnectMiles partners. 
For 2023, CPA, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), expects consolidated capacity to grow in the 12-
13% band from 2022 actuals. CPA expects the current-year operating margin to be between 22% and 24%. Load 
factor (% of seats filled by passengers) is expected to be approximately 85%. Fuel price per gallon of $2.85 is 
expected for the current year. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[7] 
2. United Airlines widened the scope of its code-sharing partnership with Azul. Under the expanded deal, 
passengers can fly to six new destinations after connecting from the designated Brazilian airports to Orlando or Fort 
Lauderdale on UAL flights. The six new destinations are Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, San Francisco, Washington 
DC, and Los Angeles. The customer-friendly move will allow them to travel using a single ticket for both UAL and 
Azul-operated flights. From May 10, passengers will be able to make easy one-stop connections to the above 
Airline Stock Roundup: CPA Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, GOL, UAL & RYAAY in Focus
destinations with a single ticket. The expanded [8]partnership between the two airline companies was built on their 
existing codeshare routesfromHoustonand Newark. 
3. Ryanair placed a huge order for 150 new 737 MAX-10 planes from Boeing. These planes, expected to be 
delivered between 2027 and 2033, will reportedly [9]replace the aging 737 jets in the airline's fleet. 
On a separate note, 16 million passengers were ferried on RYAAY flights in April. This compared favorably with the 
March figure of 12.6 million and the year-ago number of 14.2 million. Owing to the upbeat traffic, load factor was as

Court annuls EU approval of billions for Lufthansa, SAS
Court annuls EU approval of billions for Lufthansa, SAS

BRUSSELS (AP) — A top European Union court ruled Wednesday that EU competition authorities were wrong to 
approve massive bailouts designed to help German flag-carrier Lufthansa and Scandinavian airline SAS deal with 
the impact of COVID-19 restrictions.
The 27 EU member countries must seek approval from the bloc's executive branch, the European Commission, 
when granting financial support to companies. Many countries across Europe did so in 2020 to help keep their 
airlines afloat during the pandemic.
In June 2020, Germany notified the commission of its intent to provide 6 billion euros ($6.6 billion) in aid to 
Lufthansa. That August, Denmark and Sweden indicated they would be providing 1.07 billion euros ($1.17 billion) in 
support to SAS.
Low-cost Irish carrier Ryanair, which also was struggling to survive at the time, appealed to the EU’s General Court, 
which ruled that the commission “committed several errors” in making its positive assessment of the German plan.
Among the errors, a statement from the court said, was thinking “that Lufthansa was unable to obtain financing on 
the markets for the entirety of its needs” and “failing to require a mechanism incentivizing Lufthansa to buy back 
Germany’s shareholding as quickly as possible.”
The Luxembourg-based tribunal said the commission also acted incorrectly “by denying that Lufthansa held 
significant market power at certain airports, and by accepting various commitments that do not ensure that effective 
competition on the market is preserved.”
Concerning Ryainair's challenge of the state aid to SAS, the court ruled that “the contested decision must be 
annulled in its entirety.”
It was not immediately clear what impact the rulings might have in the situations the court considered or on other 
such decisions in the airline sector.
Court annuls EU approval of billions for Lufthansa, SAS
The European Commission said only that “we will carefully study the judgement and reflect on possible next steps.” 
A commission spokesperson noted that Lufthansa had paid back the aid to Germany. SAS has not yet paid back 
Denmark and Sweden.
“SAS will now, together with the states, review the content of the ruling as well as possible ways to proceed, and 
will revert on these issues when there is information to share," the airline said Wednesday.
Ryanair welcomed both rulings, describing them as “a triumph for fair competition and consumers across the EU.”
An airline spokesperson said in a statement the decisions “confirm that the commission must act as a guardian of 
the level playing field in air transport and cannot sign-off discriminatory state aid under political pressure by national 
governments.”
The commission is the EU’s anti-trust watchdog. As pandemic restrictions in 2020 brought travel to a halt and 
threatened the very existence of airlines, it eased its policies, approving billions of euros in support for national flag-
carriers.
Under a fast-track system set up during what the commission describes as “an unprecedented crisis,” Brussels 
approved around 3 trillion euros in state support across all sectors in the 27 member nations. Ryanair believes that 
40 billion euros was granted to Europe’s airline sector alone.

Eoin Treacy's view
Since the GPT chatbot reveal a few months ago Nvidia has been the go-to investment destination for traders 
looking for an AI proxy. The company is the leader in developing the kind of graphics cards required to parse image 
data for the AI sector. That has fuelled both a rebound in the semiconductor sector and a rush by companies to 
compete.

Boeing Wins $40 Billion Ryanair Order for 737 Max Jets
This article from Bloomberg may be of interest. Here is a section:
The huge commitment to Boeing's largest 737 variant marks an important endorsement from one of the US 
manufacturer's most loyal customers and highlights how carriers are willing to splurge on fleet upgrades 
again as air travel rebounds. Ryanair said the deal - the largest order ever placed by an Irish company for 
US manufactured goods - was more expensive than its current crop of 737 deliveries.
"We paid more per seat but we're still incredibly happy with the deal we've done," Chief Executive Officer 
Michael O'Leary said at a news conference. "We think the extra seats give us the revenue-earning 
potential."
Deliveries will start in 2027 and run through 2033. Ryanair said discussions surrounding the purchase 
started in January, and half the order is earmarked for replacement of older 737NG models while the other 
half is reserved for growth.
Eoin Treacy's view
From Boeing's perspective this is a big vote of confidence in the 737 Max. Considering several of the aircraft have 
fallen out of the sky, there was understandable reticence among customers to buy them. Boeing is obviously hoping 
this order will mark a recovery for commercial aircraft sales.

Fire on 'Shadow' Tanker off Malaysia is Extinguished, Search Continues
This article from Maritime-Executive.com may be of interest. Here is a section:
During a press briefing in Malaysia, the Russian captain of the vessel described the situation saying that he 
had discovered a fire amidship early afternoon on Monday. The initial discovery of smoke was followed by 
one or more loud explosions which he said shook the vessel, broke the windows, and rendered most of the 
communications systems inoperable.
"The fire on the upper deck destroyed our aerial, none of the communication equipment was functioning," 
the captain told NST TV in Malaysia. "I had to use the walkie talkie ...I finally got in touch with our engineer 
via the walkie talkie but by then all our safety boats were destroyed."
The captain said the desperate crew had gone into the water in their life jackets and luckily two ships were 
in the immediate area to assist with the rescue. He said in the confusion with the crew going in all 
directions it had been impossible for him to get a head count. He said the fire was also being spread by 
windy conditions.
Eoin Treacy's view
Fuller Treacy Comment of the Day - Boeing Wins $40 Billion Ryanair Order for 737 Max Jets, and more...
The tankers carrying Russia oil around the world can't be insured. That means the only ships anyone is willing to 
send on those journeys are decrepit and old. Most are probably on the verge of being scrapped. It is only a matter 
of time before one of these vessels sinks, with a full cargo onboard. That will create an international incident where 
no one will take responsibility and there will be no insurance cover.

Passenger charter operator Budget Lines (BD, Bangkok Suvarnabhumi) is making a concerted foray into the cargo 
sector, leasing a B737-800(BCF) from BBAM. The aircraft, HS-IIT (msn 33551), was ferried to Bangkok Don 
Mueang from Haikou on April 29, 2023.
The airline has operated private passenger charter flights using Piper (twin piston) Chieftain PA31s since 2014. But 
two years ago, Budget Lines flagged entering the cargo sphere, saying at the time it planned to launch B737 
freighter ops later that year, with flights around Southeast Asia as well as to India and South Korea. However, HS-
IIT is the first freighter to be delivered to the carrier.
Budget Lines joins K-Mile Asia (8K, Bangkok Suvarnabhumi) as one of a handful of Thailand-based airlines with 
dedicated cargo operations. HS-IIT is almost 20 years old, been introduced into service by Ryanair (FR, Dublin 
International) in the second half of 2003. If flew for that airline until late 2021, and was ferried to Guangzhou for 
conversion early last year. Budget Lines is operating the aircraft on behalf of Singapore's Blueorbit Logistics.
Budget Lines is a holding brand for Air Inter Transport. When collecting the five year air operator's certificate for 
B737 operations back in September 2022, CEO Thosaphol Wongkitikorn said that he planned to target the e-
commerce and perishable freight markets. He also added that he believed Thailand could become a major cargo 
hub.

Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun and Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary are both confident that Boeing will fulfill Ryanair's 
order for 150 737-10 Max planes, with options for 150 more, despite supply chain and regulatory challenges.
O'Leary acknowledged that new problems can be "frustrating," but said both Boeing and Airbus "have done a terrific 
job of repairing what was a very fractured supply chain challenge post-Covid."
The deal, worth over $40 billion at list prices, was described by both leaders as "win-win" after a complex 
negotiation. Calhoun stated that Boeing anticipated logistics challenges would improve by 2023 and 2024, and this 
has been the case.
"No technical issues have arisen such that there's a concern that we won't be able to resolve," Calhoun said. "It's 
documentation, documentation, documentation."
Despite a delay caused by a problem with a 737 MAX supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, O'Leary praised Boeing's 
progress over the last year.
Calhoun confirmed that the Federal Aviation Administration's certification process for the MAX-10 is on track, and 
O'Leary said that there are "no issues" from regulators.
The 737-10 Max's increased fuel efficiency and greater passenger capacity with 30 additional seats make it 
beneficial for both companies. Ryanair aims to carry 300 million passengers annually by March 2034, with the MAX-
10 playing a key role.
While the final agreement includes a rebate for Ryanair, the Boeing chief said it also represented a good deal for 
the US company.
While there has been talk about Boeing developing a new plane model, O'Leary said the industry is primarily 
focused on improving fuel efficiency in engines and achieving low-carbon transport, particularly in Europe, where 
there are stiffer environmental rules.

EU court annuls approval of (EURO)6 billion in state aid for Lufthansa
EU court annuls approval of (EURO)6 billion in state aid for Lufthansa

A European Union court has annulled the approval for German state aid granted to Lufthansa worth (EURO)6 billion 
($6.6 billion) during the Covid-19 pandemic in a ruling on Wednesday.
The EU General Court cancelled the decision by the European Commission to approve the state aid, citing "several 
errors" in a statement.
The commission wrongly assumed Lufthansa could not borrow from financial markets, misjudged the German 
airline's market power at certain airports and agreed conditions which did not ensure effective competition between 
airlines, the EU court found.
The billion-euro aid package for Lufthansa was awarded in the spring of 2020 and received approval from the 
commission, the bloc's top competition watchdog, later in June.
Ryanair and German leisure airline Condor filed a legal case against the decision.
The EU's usually strict aid rules were loosened at the outbreak of the pandemic to allow governments to support 
struggling companies but still required commission approval.
Germany's largest airline, Lufthansa, received financial support from the government after Covid-19 travel 
restrictions brought business to a standstill.
Tens of thousands of jobs were on the line in the company, which employs around 110,000 people.
The ruling may be appealed at the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the bloc's highest court.

Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair has struck a multibillion-dollar deal to buy up to 300 Boeing aircraft, signalling a big 
expansion of its fleet in the latest sign of the travel industry's revival. The agreement for the 737 Max-10 aircraft, 
including 150 options, is valued at more than $40bn at current list prices, although airlines typically secure 
significant discounts on large orders.
It comes after discussions collapsed more than 18 months ago over a disagreement on price.
The aircraft will be delivered between 2027 and 2033.
The order is an endorsement of the largest variant of Boeing's 737 Max and underlines the appetite of airlines to 
splash out on new aircraft as travel has rebounded in the wake of the pandemic.
The boom in demand has led to industry-wide supply chain problems and left Boeing and rival Airbus struggling to 
deliver jets to big customers.
Boeing warned last month that a production issue on the Max would hamper deliveries in the short term, which 
Ryanair said would lead to a small number of flight cancellations this summer.
Ryanair to buy up to $40bn of Boeing aircraft and create 10,000 jobs Airlines
Ryanair yesterday said that the substantial new order would allow it to increase traffic by 80 per cent over the next 
decade, and forecast passenger numbers to increase from 168mn passengers at the end of March this year to 
300mn by March 2034.
Some 150 of the new aircraft will be used to replace Ryanair's older Boeing 737NG planes.
The airline said the agreement would create more than 10,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary had spent much of the past 18 months criticising Boeing and its leadership 
over its prices, and the production problems that have led to delays and setbacks in the delivery of its aircraft in the 
past two years.
But O'Leary said the talks on the order, which restarted earlier this year, had accelerated faster than expected.
"We have been pleasantly surprised by the meeting of minds" between the two companies, he said, adding that the 
rebound in the industry was another factor driving the deal. "If we didn't move quickly, there was a danger we would 
have been looking at later deliveries in 2028 or 2029."
The deal will also allow Ryanair to offer lower fares in Europe, O'Leary said. The airline selected the largest version 
of the Max, which he said will have 21 per cent more seats but burn 20 per cent less fuel than the airline's current 
737NGs.
Ryanair chief financial officer Neil Sorahan said the new aircraft would cut costs by 10 per cent excluding fuel, 
compared with the older 737NGs which are still in service.
He said this would allow the airline to cement its cost advantage over rivals and fuel further growth, estimating that 
Ryanair would carry 30 per cent of all European short-passengers if it hits the target of 300mn passengers in the 
2030s.
The carrier says the order will allow it to increase traffic by 80% over the next decade

Body
Boeing and Ryanair have announced an agreement for the low-cost airline's largest-ever purchase, with an order 
for up to 300 Boeing 737 Max 10 planes.  The initial agreement, valued at around $40bn, stated that Ryanair has 
ordered 150 of the jets, with options for 150 more, as it looks to expand its fleet amidst strong post-pandemic travel 
demands and a move towards more efficient and sustainable fuel use.  The 228-seat plane is seen as a greener 
technology aircraft and will burn 20% less fuel and be 50% quieter than Ryanair's current 737-NG craft.  CEO 
Michael O'Leary said: "We expect half of this order will replace older NGs while the remaining 150 aircraft will 
facilitate controlled, sustainable growth to just over 300 million guests per annum by 2034.   "This order, coupled 
with our remaining Gamechanger deliveries, will create 10,000 new jobs for highly paid aviation professionals over 
the next decade and these jobs will be generated across all of Europe's main economies where Ryanair is currently 
the No.1 or No.2 airline."  Ryanair's purchase is seen as a way for the company to widen the cost gap with other 
European airlines due to the increased number of seats in the Boeing 737 Max jets over the 737-NGs.  The 
beginning of 2023 has so far been a strong period for Boeing as it benefits from airline companies receiving post-
pandemic demand and a desire to replace ageing fleets. 
Air India recently placed a record $70bn order for almost 500 new aircraft, including 220 from Boeing, and Riyadh 
Air agreed to the purchase of up to 72 Dreamliner craft earlier this year. Boeing's president and CEO Dave Calhoun 
said: "The Boeing-Ryanair partnership is one of the most productive in commercial aviation history, enabling both 
companies to succeed and expand affordable travel to hundreds of millions of people.  "Nearly a quarter century 
after our companies signed our first direct aeroplane purchase, this landmark deal will further strengthen our 
partnership."  Although the Max 10s have yet to be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration, O'Leary told a 
press conference that he has no fear that the aircraft will be approved by regulators. The regulation process for this 
model is expected to be completed by 2024.  Additionally, Boeing is currently working on addressing supply 
constraints that came about after supply chain issues appeared following the Covid-19 pandemic. Calhoun sought

to ease fears about an aircraft shortage, something that was predicted by experts at the beginning of this year, by 
declaring that his company was evaluating its capacity every step of the way.

Ryanair has won a European Union court challenge which cancels regulatory approval for a (EURO)6bn (£5.2bn) 
cash injection for rival airline Lufthansa amid the pandemic.
The EU General Court in Luxembourg has annulled the European Commission's decision from June 2020 to 
recapitalise the airline, saying its assessment included "several errors".
It added that it was wrong to consider that Lufthansa "was unable to obtain financing on the markets for the entirety 
of its needs". 
Ryanair also won a separate bid to topple the EU's 2020 approval of similar aid to SAS Airlines.
The commission in June 2020 approved the Lufthansa measures, saying a government plan to take a 20% stake in 
Europe's largest airline was in line with the bloc's state-aid rules and would prevent the carrier's collapse.
Shares in RyanAir, which is due to report full year results on May 22nd, were trading 2.2% higher late morning.

Boom in high-end holidaymakers spurs airlines to spruce up luxury-class cabins
Boom in high-end holidaymakers spurs airlines to spruce up luxury-class

Big-spending holidaymakers are spearheading a boom in first and businessclass flight bookings, leading big airlines 
to bet on a new era of luxury travel with investments in their cabins and lounges.
Lufthansa said this month that the "very strongest demand" for travel this year has been in its premium cabins, and 
that leisure travellers have "almost completely compensated" for the slower return of corporate bookings.
The airline's chief executive, Carsten Spohr, said that he expected a "permanent shift" towards holidaymakers filling 
business and first-class seats, as he drew comparisons with the recent boom enjoyed by luxury sectors, from cars 
and watches to prime real estate.
"This year is the first year all my team tells me we need to grow first class ... I never thought I would ever hear that," 
Spohr said.
Ben Smith, chief executive of Air France-KLM, said that it was investing to keep up with demand from high-end 
leisure travellers who were "more than making up" for falling corporate travel.
Airlines are hoping to tap into relentless demand for luxury goods and experiences, which has rebounded rapidly 
following Covid-19 lockdowns in 2020.
Boom in high-end holidaymakers spurs airlines to spruce up luxury-class cabins
"[It is] not just us: ask the same question of luxury hotels and business ... the whole sector is doing extremely well," 
Smith said.
Travel in first and business-class cabins has recovered faster than total passenger traffic, according to global 
airlines body Iata. Premium passenger numbers reached 86 per cent of 2019 levels in February, against an 
industrywide total of 81 per cent.
The surge in high-end travel comes as steep inflation has bitten into household budgets, raising questions over 
whether demand for flying is sustainable.
Gulf carrier Etihad became the latest airline to announce a significant investment in its premium product, launching 
a new business-class suite last week.
Lufthansa has embarked on a (EURO)2.5bn refit of its long-haul cabins, including a new first-class seat, while 
Australia's Qantas announced a $100mn investment in its lounges this year.
Nigel Goode, chair of aircraft-interior designer PriestmanGoode, said demand from airline clients was "really picking 
up", adding that they were focused on designing less "opulent" cabins for a younger generation of travellers.

 The European Union Court of Justice nullified the European Commission's decision that permitted the German 
government to grant 6 billion euros of financial aid to Lufthansa (LHA.F) during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The EU general court said Wednesday it identified "several errors" in the commission's approval process, including 
its neglect to compel Lufthansa to repurchase the German government's shareholding quickly and allowing 
commitments without ensuring that effective market competition remained.
Irish budget airline Ryanair (RYA.IR) and German leisure airline Condor had challenged the commission's decision, 
and the court acknowledged that the bailout could affect both companies' position as direct competitors of 
Lufthansa.
Lufthansa and Ryanair were each down marginally on Monday morning.

RYANAIR has placed a multibillion dollar order for up to 300 Boeing 737 Max 10 jets in a deal which would mark 
the end of a dispute between the two aviation giants.
The deal is estimated to be worth around $40bn (£31.7m) based on listed prices, with a discount likely due to the 
sheer size of the order.
Boeing said that a firm order of 150 of the largest of Boeing's 737 max planes had been made, with the option of 
150 more. Shares in the group rose 2.5 per cent shortly after the announcement.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said that 150 of the jets will replace older planes in the fleet, with the 
other 150 facilitating "growth to just over 300m guests per annum by 2034".
The announcement will bolster the Boeing 737 brand, which has faced a drop in global deliveries due to two major 
accidents that saw the airliner grounded in 2019.
The triple-digit deal concludes 18 months of dispute between Boeing and Ryanair, after discussions collapsed last 
year.
The Ryanair boss subsequently criticised delays to orders and the company's management, who he said were 
"running around like headless chickens".
O'Leary has said he is confident in the post-Covid-19 recovery of the aviation industry.

Half of the 737-MAX-10 order has been described as firm, with the remaining being options. 
The airline claims this is the largest order ever placed by an Irish company for US manufactured goods. 
Phased deliveries will start in 2027 and run until 2033, with half of the new purchases set to replace older aircraft in 
the Ryanair fleet, boosting efficiency and cutting emissions. 
The new aircraft, which have 228 seats, are to be used to meet Ryanair's traffic which it forecasts will grow by 80% 
and reach 300m passengers a year by 2034. 
The airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary described the deal as 'the ideal growth aircraft order for Ryanair, our 
passengers, our people and our shareholders'. 
'These new, fuel efficient, greener technology aircraft offer 21% more seats, burn 20% less fuel and are 50% 
quieter than our B737-NGs,' he said. 
He added that the deal would enable Ryanair to create more than 10,000 new high-paid jobs for pilots, cabin crew 
and engineers. 
Given the size and scale of the transaction, it will be subject to shareholder approval at Ryanair's next annual 
general meeting. 
'Landmark deal' 
Boeing's president and chief executive, Dave Calhoun, said the Boeing-Ryanair partnership is 'one of the most 
productive in commercial aviation history'. 
He said it enabled both companies to succeed and expanded affordable travel for the public. 
'Nearly a quarter century after our companies signed our first direct airplane purchase, this landmark deal will 
further strengthen our partnership,' he added. 
'We are committed to delivering for Ryanair and helping Europe's largest airline group achieve its goals by offering 
its customers the lowest fares in Europe.'

EU court annuls approval of €6 billion in state aid for Lufthansa

 A European Union court has annulled Brussels' approval for German state aid granted to Lufthansa worth €6 billion 
during the COVID-19 pandemic.The European Commission should not have approved the German government's 
decision to provide Lufthansa with billions of euros in state aid during the coronavirus pandemic, the EU General 
Court ruled on Wednesday. 
Strict EU guidelines against government bailouts of companies were loosened during the pandemic and the 
Commission approved the €6 billion ($6.6 billion) package in June 2020. 
The case against the aid was brought by Ryanair and Condor, which called the state support unfair. 
In its ruling, the court said, "The Commission committed several errors, in particular, by considering that Lufthansa 
was unable to obtain financing on the markets for the entirety of its needs." 
The Commission also misjudged the German airline's market power at certain airports and agreed to conditions that 
did not ensure effective competition between airlines, the EU court found. 
Lufthansa to analyze ruling 
Lufthansa noted that the "stabilization measures" were "already fully terminated before today's court ruling." 
This means it has already paid back the bailout money, making it unclear what effect the ruling will have. 
The airline can appeal the ruling to the European Court of Justice.

 Can and willLufthansa[1] be forced to repay thestate aid that the airline received as part of the recapitalization plan 
during the Covid crisis in June 2020? That's the question now that the Court of Justice of the European Union[2] 
ruled on Wednesday that the European Commission made mistakes when approving that aid package of the 
German government. The case was filed by Ryanair and Condor Airlines. Will Lufthansa once more have to repay 
the German state aid? 
'The Commission committed several errors, in particular, by considering that Lufthansa was unable to obtain 
financing on the markets for the entirety of its needs, by failing to require a mechanism incentivizing Lufthansa to 
buy back Germany's shareholding as quickly as possible, by denying that Lufthansa held significant market power 
at certain airports, and by accepting various commitments that do not ensure that effective competition on the 
market is preserved,' the General Court says in a media statement.

Ryanair to order between 150 and 300 Boeing 737 Max jets
Ryanair to order between 150 and 300 Boeing 737 Max jets

Ryanair said Tuesday it agreed to buy 150 Boeing 737 Max planes with an option for 150 more, marking the biggest 
aircraft purchase in the Irish airline's history and a boost for Boeing.
At Boeing's list prices, the deal would be worth more than $40 billion if Ryanair exercises all the options, but airlines 
routinely get deep discounts. Financial terms were not disclosed.
Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary said the planes will replace some of the airline's older Boeing jets and provide room 
for growth. The airline expects to receive the planes between 2027 and 2033.
The low-cost carrier selected the largest version of the Max, which will be outfitted with 228 seats.
Boeing is benefitting from a boom in airplane orders, as air travel around the world recovers from the COVID-19 
pandemic. The Arlington, Virginia-based company has struggled, however, with production issues affecting the Max 
and a larger plane, the 787 Dreamliner.
Boeing announced last month that deliveries of a “significant” number of new Max jets will be delayed while the 
company and supplier Spirit AeroSystems fix incorrect fittings between the fuselage and tail sections, a problem 
that was discovered to date back to 2019.
The announcement Tuesday amounts to a vote of confidence from one of Boeing’s best customers — and one that 
has bluntly expressed its displeasure with the aircraft maker in the past.
Last year, O’Leary went on an expletive-laced rant to complain about Boeing’s slow pace of aircraft deliveries and 
an inability to settle terms for an aircraft order. He said on a call with analysts in May 2022 that Boeing management 
“is running around like headless chickens."
On Tuesday, O'Leary said that the companies revived their stalled negotiations about two months ago. Ryanair 
agreed to pay more than it wanted — and more per seat than its last Boeing order — but it was time for the 
companies to “kiss and make up," he said.
Ryanair to order between 150 and 300 Boeing 737 Max jets
“We had a bit of a bust-up a year ago over pricing, and we had to move somewhat to get this deal done today,” he 
said during a news conference at Boeing headquarters.
O'Leary said the planes will help Ryanair grow to 300 million passengers a year by 2034, nearly double the current 
number, and with planes that are more fuel-efficient than its current fleet.
U.S. regulators have not yet approved the plane that Ryanair ordered, the 737 Max 10. Boeing CEO David Calhoun 
said the company hopes to win certification by the Federal Aviation Administration in 2024 — three years ahead of 
Ryanair's first expected delivery.
Boeing has received other large orders, including for the Max 10, recently from United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and 
Air India.
Separately, Boeing reported that through April — and not counting the Ryanair deal — it has taken net orders for 69 
planes this year. European rival Airbus said it booked 144 net orders in the same period.
Shares of Boeing closed up more than 2% Tuesday.

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) has confirmed an order for 300 new aircraft at a cost of 
US$40bn (£32bn), marking the largest acquisition to date for the Euronext Dublin-listed carrier.
Of the 300 Boeing 737 MAX 10s on order, 150 orders have been firmly secured. 
Negotiations for the acquisition had been in progress prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, but were halted 
in September 2021 due to the inability of Ryanair and Boeing to reach a mutually agreeable pricing agreement.
"We expect these new, larger, more efficient, greener, aircraft to drive further unit cost savings, which will be 
passed on to passengers in lower airfares," said chief executive Michael O'Leary.
He added: "The extra seats, lower fuel burn and more competitive aircraft pricing supported by our strong balance 
sheet, will widen the cost gap between Ryanair and competitor EU airlines for many years to come."
The 228-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10 aircraft have 228 seats- 21% more than the currently used modified Boeing 737 
Max 8's.
More seats mean more potential revenue, but the new aircraft will also have a downside.
As O'Leary stated back in March: "If you want us to buy an aircraft with 30 extra seats that we have to fill six times a 
day, that's a lot of yield dilution. Therefore we need a much more competitive seat price if you want the extra 30 
seats."
Delivery of the aircraft is expected between 2027 and 2033.

Irish airline Ryanair has placed an order for 300 Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft worth a total of $40 billion, the airline 
said on Tuesday.
Following the news, Boeing was seen trading up by 2.18% at $201.57 per share in the pre-market trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange.
The aircraft are expected to be delivered during the period from 2027 to 2033. Boeing's B737-MAX-10 aircraft will 
enable Ryanair to facilitate a traffic growth of 80% from 168 million in March 2023 to 300 million a year by March 
2034.
Ryanair expects 50% of these deliveries will replace older B737NGs. In addition to significant revenue growth, the 
new order offers Ryanair with extra seats to further widen Ryanair's unit-cost advantage over all EU competitor 
airlines.
Ryanair Group chief executive Michael O'Leary said: "These new, fuel-efficient, greener technology aircraft offer 
21% more seats, burn 20% less fuel and are 50% quieter than our B737-NGs. This order, coupled with our 
remaining gamechanger deliveries, will create 10,000 new jobs for highly paid aviation professionals over the next 
decade, and these jobs will be located across all of Europe's main economies where Ryanair is currently the 
number 1 or number 2 airline."

Ryanair has announced an order for over 300 Boeing 737 Max jets to support the Irish airline's future expansion 
plans. The order, which includes a firm order for 150 of the larger 737-10 variant and options for 150 more, is the 
biggest in Ryanair's history.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said the new, fuel-efficient aircraft will offer 21% more seats, burn 20% less fuel, and 
be 50% quieter than the older 737-NGs they are replacing.
Ryanair has deployed a growing fleet of 737-8-200 airplanes to accelerate its post-pandemic recovery and meet 
strong travel demand. The 197-seat 737-8-200 model has helped the airline reduce fuel use and emissions by over 
20% compared to the airplanes they are replacing. The new order adds the larger 737-10 variant, which offers 
Ryanair 228 seats and the best unit economics of any single-aisle airplane.
"We expect half of this order will replace older NGs, while the remaining 150 aircraft will facilitate controlled, 
sustainable growth to just over 300m guests per annum by 2034. This order, coupled with our remaining 
Gamechanger deliveries, will create 10,000 new jobs for highly-paid aviation professionals over the next decade, 
and these jobs will be generated across all of Europe's main economies where Ryanair is currently the No.1 or No.2 
airline," O'Leary said.
"In addition to delivering significant revenue and market growth opportunities across Europe, we expect these new 
larger more efficient aircraft to drive further unit cost savings, which will be passed on to passengers in lower 
airfares. The extra seats, lower fuel burn, and more competitive aircraft pricing supported by our strong balance 
sheet will widen the cost gap between Ryanair and competitor EU airlines for many years to come, making the 
Boeing MAX 10 the ideal growth aircraft order for Ryanair, our passengers, our people, and our shareholders."
"The Boeing-Ryanair partnership is one of the most productive in commercial aviation history, enabling both 
companies to succeed and expand affordable travel to hundreds of millions of people," said Boeing President and 
CEO Dave Calhoun. "Nearly a quarter-century after our companies signed our first direct airplane purchase, this

airline group achieve its goals."

       Irish airline company Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) said on Tuesday that it has ordered $40 billion 
worth 300 new Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft.
 Following the news, Boeing Company (BA) was seen trading up by 2.18 percent at $201.57 per share in the pre-
market trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
 The aircraft are expected to be delivered during the period from 2027 to 2033.
 Boeing's B737-MAX-10 aircraft will enable Ryanair to facilitate a traffic growth of 80 percent from 168 million in 
year end March 2023, to 300 million a year by March 2034.
 Ryanair expects 50 percent of these deliveries will replace older B737NGs.
 In addition to a significant revenue growth, the new order offers Ryanair with extra seats to further widen Ryanair's 
unit-cost advantage over all EU competitor airlines.
 Ryanair Group CEO, Michael O'Leary, said: "...These new, fuel efficient, greener technology aircraft offer 21% 
more seats, burn 20% less fuel and are 50% quieter than our B737-NGs. This order, coupled with our remaining 
Gamechanger deliveries, will create 10,000 new jobs for highly paid aviation professionals over the next decade, 
and these jobs will be located across all of Europe's main economies where Ryanair is currently the No.1 or No.2 
airline."

Teesside Airport celebrates 'fantastic figures' as new holiday flights take off
Teesside Airport celebrates 'fantastic figures' as new holiday flights take off

May 09, 2023( Bdaily Business News: http://bdaily.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Teesside Airport has been named the second most punctual in the UK, new figures from the Civil Aviation Authority 
have revealed. 
2022 was the busiest year for more than a decade at Teesside, welcoming more than 173,000 passengers through 
its terminal, up more than 200 per cent on the previous year. At the height of the summer season in July, it was 
named the most punctual, with delays of just 11 minutes and nearly half of all flights taking off early. 
Data on flight delays during 2022 showed that the average delay per departing flight at Teesside was just 14 
minutes, more than half that of the airport with the longest delays (30 minutes) and just one minute off grabbing the 
top spot. 
These figures will be great news for holidaymakers jetting out of the airport as TUI today ( May 9) launches its first 
flights of 2023 to Majorca. From May 27, the airline will double the number of services to the popular destination 
thanks to its successful season last summer. 
Fairs-Lloyds Travel is also reintroducing its travel packages to Jersey on Saturday, ahead of TUI's service to 
Antalya, Turkey, beginning on May 25 and Balkan Holidays' Bulgaria trips on May 27. Ryanair will start its season 
on June 3 with Corfu. 
It will also be 'easier and smoother than ever' for passengers to pass through security to departures after the airport 
became the UK's first to scrap the 100ml liquid requirement, meaning you can carry up to two litres of liquid per 
item. There is now also no need to remove liquid and electronics from bags thanks to its new security scanners. 
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen commented: 'These fantastic figures show just how quick, easy and convenient it 
is for people to fly from their local airport this summer. They can get from their car, through check-in and security 
and be relaxing in departures in just minutes, and we're always looking at ways to cut this time even more. 
'Some delays will always be inevitable and outside of our control. But thanks to the investments we've made in our 
terminal and equipment, our staff and by bringing teams in-house, we're almost at the top of the table, even while 
seeing the most passengers since 2011. 
'Last July we were named the most punctual for that month, and our dedicated airport team will do everything they 
can to claw back that minute as we ramp up our 2023 holiday flights to make us the best we can be.'

May 09, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Tuesday, May 9th, 2023 
It's a busy time on the investment calendar, for sure: Q1 earnings season is still barely halfway over, economic 
prints on our present inflation situation, political brinksmanship (playing chicken with the debt ceiling) in Washington 
DC and continuing drama over regional banks destabilizing are all vying for attention. Yet this morning, we're a little 
quiet here in the office. 
Mostly, that's because the biggest news items scheduled for this week — tomorrow morning's Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) tomorrow afternoon's Walt Disney Co. DIS[1] earnings report — haven't happened yet. There are no 
major economic prints hitting the tape before today's opening bell. After the bell, we will hear from Fed Governor 
Philip Jefferson and New York Fed President John Williams. And after today's close, we'll see new earnings reports 
from Airbnb ABNB[2], Twilio TWLO[3] and Wynn Resorts WYNN[4], among others. 
This morning, UnderArmour UAA[5] put out fiscal Q4 earnings results ahead of today's open, improving over 
estimates on both top and bottom lines for the quarter. Earnings of 18 cents per share outpaced the 15 cents in the 
Zacks consensus (and vastly improved from the year-ago -$0.01 per share), for its third positive earnings surprise 
in the past four quarters. Revenues of $1.4 billion surpassed expectations on the top line by +1.23%, and beat the 
year-ago quarter by +7.7%. 
Yet inventory issues — clearing out excessive glut of merchandise by way of offering additional promotions for 
longer — is expected to hit gross margins at UnderArmour going forward. Thus, fiscal year EPS for the company 
has been lowered to 47-51 cents; the Zacks consensus had previously been for 54 cents per share. This has led 
shares to come down -5% in today's pre-market session. For more on UAA's earnings, click here. 
Also this morning, 150 new 737 MAX-10 planes have been ordered from Boeing BA[6] by its long-time partner 
Ryanair RYAAY[7] for a list price of $40.2 billion. (This is not the price Ryanair will ultimately pay for these planes; 
this would be the price you or I would be expected to pay if we were to try and buy them.) Assembly is expected to 
begin in 2024 and deliveries to begin in 2027. Both companies are up roughly +1% in pre-market trading on the 
news. 
Otherwise, early market traders are in a giving mood this morning — the Dow is -80 points at this hour, the Nasdaq 
is -70 and the S&P 500 -15 points — from yesterday's flat trading day overall. Perhaps we'll see some market 
Boeing Sells 150 Planes, UAA Beats but Lowers

MAX10 vs A321 in the European market

 Mr. O'Leary got a deal he could live with, while Mr. Calhoun got a deal he could live with. Does it matter what the 
strike price is? The key number is the operating cost difference between a Ryanair MAX10 and a Wizz Air A321. 
What might the MAX10 vs. A321 in the European market look like? 
As we usually do, we turn to skailark[1]'s excellent cost model to get some ideas. We are starting with a few metrics 
for January 2023. On a broad brush look, Wizz has five areas of advantage over Ryanair, and Ryanair has two 
areas better than Wizz. Wizz only has a 1.3% cost advantage concerning cost per block hour. So the competition is 
tight. 
Source: skailark 
Digging into the data, we discover this when making metrics comparable. 'Burden,' the sum of overhead and fuel, 
accounts for over half the two airline operating expenses. While Ryanair has lower-cost fuel, Wizz has a big 
advantage in overhead. Confirming the table above, the difference between the two is marginal. 
Source: skailark 
Where is the difference, then? Why does Ryanair's O'Leary want the MAX 10? Here is where we think the answer 
becomes clearer. The aircraft shown below are flown by these two airlines; fortunately, there's no crossover to 
muddle the data. Since fuel is the biggest input, we will focus on that. 
Source: skailark 
The MAX8-200 deployed by Ryanair shows a sharp improvement in fuel burn over -800NG (35.4%). Meanwhile, at 
Wizz, the A320neo shows a 23% improved fuel burn over the A320ceo. In these segments, the two are running 
neck and neck. 
When you get to the A321neo, note it burns 12.5% more fuel per seat but seats 230 compared to 200 for the Max 
8-200. At such tight margins, the 15% more capacity means, all things being equal, 15% more revenue. Ryanair 
wants that revenue, and Mr. O'Leary pointedly spoke about the ancillary revenue potential the MAX 10 offers. The 
larger airplane should fly further; therefore, ancillary revenue potential rises - passengers will get thirsty and hungry. 
They likely run out of snacks in their pockets on longer flights. 
The MAX 8-200 does not compete effectively with the A321neo. But the MAX 10 does. The MAX 10 will take longer 
to load and unload. But the comparison with the MAX 8-200 is the wrong one. It should take as long as the 
A321neo, which is the appropriate yardstick. 
MAX10 vs A321 in the European market
If Wizz is Ryanair's most effective competitor in Europe, then the MAX 10 is what Ryanair needs to ensure it 
remains competitive. The final table lists new deliveries for these two airlines from 2021 through 5/8/23. 
Wizz bet on the A321neo, which was a smart move. That model is in very high demand. Ryanair bet on the MAX 8-
200 and was the launch customer - which was a smart move then. But the market shifted. Ryanair can't get the 
MAX 10s soon enough. Although it is a far larger airline, Ryanair does not want Wizz to grow faster because of 
model size. This is going to be a fascinating race to watch.

May 09, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 It's a busy time on the investment calendar, for sure: Q1 earnings season is still barely halfway over, economic 
prints on our present inflation situation, political brinksmanship (playing chicken with the debt ceiling) in Washington 
DC and continuing drama over regional banks destabilizing are all vying for attention. Yet this morning, we're a little 
quiet here in the office. 
Mostly, that's because the biggest news items scheduled for this week — tomorrow morning's Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) tomorrow afternoon's Walt Disney Co. (DIS[1]) earnings report — haven't happened yet. There are no 
major economic prints hitting the tape before today's opening bell. After the bell, we will hear from Fed Governor 
Philip Jefferson and New York Fed President John Williams. And after today's close, we'll see new earnings reports 
from Airbnb (ABNB[2]), Twilio (TWLO[3]) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN[4]), among others. 
This morning, UnderArmour (UAA[5]) put out fiscal Q4 earnings results ahead of today's open, improving over 
estimates on both top and bottom lines for the quarter. Earnings of 18 cents per share outpaced the 15 cents in the 
Zacks consensus (and vastly improved from the year-ago -$0.01 per share), for its third positive earnings surprise 
in the past four quarters. Revenues of $1.4 billion surpassed expectations on the top line by +1.23%, and beat the 
year-ago quarter by +7.7%. 
Yet inventory issues — clearing out excessive glut of merchandise by way of offering additional promotions for 
longer — is expected to hit gross margins at UnderArmour going forward. Thus, fiscal year EPS for the company 
has been lowered to 47-51 cents; the Zacks consensus had previously been for 54 cents per share. This has led 
shares to come down -5% in today's pre-market session. For more on UAA's earnings, click here. 
Also this morning, 150 new 737 MAX-10 planes have been ordered from Boeing (BA[6]) by its long-time partner 
Ryanair (RYAAY[7]) for a list price of $40.2 billion. (This is not the price Ryanair will ultimately pay for these planes; 
this would be the price you or I would be expected to pay if we were to try and buy them.) Assembly is expected to 
begin in 2024 and deliveries to begin in 2027. Both companies are up roughly +1% in pre-market trading on the 
news. 
Otherwise, early market traders are in a giving mood this morning — the Dow is -80 points at this hour, the Nasdaq 
is -70 and the S&P 500 -15 points — from yesterday's flat trading day overall. Perhaps we'll see some market 
moves on the Fed officials' take about interest rates, the debt ceiling, etc., but much more likely we'll need to wait 
for tomorrow's sub-5% (hopefully) CPI headline, year over year.

Ryanair and Boeing finally get a MAX 10 deal done

May 09, 2023( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Months earlier than anticipated by Michael O'Leary himself,Ryanair[1] has agreed withBoeing[2] on an order for 
150 MAX 10s plus 150 options. In March, the Group CEO of the Irish low-cost airline said that he anticipated 
discussions to take six months or up to a year, but he noticed there had been a willingness on both sides to get the 
deal done, he said during a press conference on Tuesday. Ryanair and Boeing finally get a MAX 10 deal done. 
Remember where this deal is coming from. In September 2021, Ryanairunilaterally ended discussions[3] with 
Boeing as the airframer was to move even an inch to offer the carrier a discount. O'Leary kept saying for months[4] 
last year that there was nothing to report but added that he wasn't in a hurry either as Ryanair had sufficient MAX 
8200s in its unfilled orders list. 
Coming January 2023, things changed and both parties approached each other again, resuming discussions in 
early March. Today O'Leary said that he was surprised about how negotiations with Boeing had gone since then. 
'We wanted to get an order done. We have to recognize what is happening in the industry: both Boeing and Airbus 
see a dramatic rebound in orders. I think Airbus' order book is longer than Boeing's, but Boeing's order book is 
filling up rapidly. On our side, if we didn't move quickly, we might have been looking at later deliveries in 2028 and 
2029 instead of 2027. From Boeing's point, it was in their interest to have a large order from their largest customer 
in Europe. Good things happen when people can move quickly.'  
Getting a discount 
 O'Learytold AirInsight in late March[5] in Brussels that talks focused on more MAX 8200s, but that Boeing was 
pressing on the MAX 10. The CEO said that he would want a significant discount for the MAX 10s if he would buy 
them because at 228 seats the yields per seat would be less favorable than those of the -8200s. 
In today's press conference, O'Leary said that 'there is a big challenge for us in stepping up (from the 189-seat 
737NGs and 197-seat MAX 8200s), in particular when you are delivering six to eight sectors per day (per aircraft) in 
a 228-seat aircraft. We said we would step up to the MAX 10 if we would get a modest discount on the additional 
seats. I am pleased to say we got a very modest discount.' 
He added that with the MAX 10, 'we will have to sell seats at lower prices in the next decade. We have to recognize 
that we have to operate across Europe in a marketplace where many of our so-called competitors are operating the 
230-seat A321neo. I believe the MAX is the better aircraft. We will continue to beat all of our competitors in Europe. 
Ryanair and Boeing finally get a MAX 10 deal done
But it would be very difficult to compete for us going forward in the next decade if we were trying to compete with a 
230-seat Airbus aircraft with a 197-seat Boeing, even how great that aircraft is.' 
A question will be if Ryanair will be able to do 25-minute turnarounds with a 228-seat aircraft. 'We will have special 
training programs for our customers for the next ten years on how to move faster.' 
For replacement and growth 
About half of the 150 aircraft on firm order will replace existing Boeing 737-800s, but the 150 MAX 10s on option will 
be for future growth. Ryanair and its subsidiaries Malta Air, Buzz, and (Airbus operator) Lauda want to carry 225 
million passengers in 2026. The new aircraft should get them to just over 300 million by 2034. 
The group has no interest in opening new, transatlantic markets with the MAX 10, but has planned an expansion 
outside Europe like Morocco, Israel, Egypt, or Jordan. And it is waiting for the day that it can re-enter Ukraine, 
where it was the biggest airline before the war started in February 2022. 
First deliveries in 2027 
Ryanair expects the first deliveries of the MAX 10s in 2027, so it should not be affected by any delays in the 
certification if they will happen this year. 'I know that the FAA is working closely with Boeing and that relationship 
has improved dramatically over the last twelve to eighteen months. We have no fear about the MAX 10s getting 
certified, whether that's in later 2024 or early 2025. It will be well ahead of our first deliveries in 2027. We will work 
with the European regulator EASA to have the aircraft certified in Europe as soon as possible.' 
Boeing will build the MAX 10 on the new, fourth assembly line in Renton in 2024. Boeing Commercial Airplanes 
President and CEO Stan Deal said that the airframer is currently targeting 50 aircraft a month in 2025, but that is 
supply-constrained. A fifth line will only be opened if the constraints will go away.

Lufthansa (LH, Frankfurt International) has finally lost a decades-long court battle with Frankfurt Hahn over 
discounted airport fees and other favourable conditions granted to Irish budget carrier Ryanair (FR, Dublin 
International), which the German flag carrier argued breached European Union state aid laws.
In a judgement on April 21, 2023, the Koblenz Higher Regional Court rejected the airline's appeal against a first-
instance judgment of the Bad Kreuznach Regional Court of May 16, 2007, according to a report by Ryanair's legal 
representative in Germany's RWS Verlag.
The case dates back to 2006 when Lufthansa first brought legal action against Flughafen Frankfurt-Hahn GmbH, at 
the time the majority shareholder of the now insolvent airport. Lufthansa sought recovery of alleged aid the airport 
had granted to Ryanair. It essentially claimed that airport fees charged by Frankfurt-Hahn in 2001 and 2006 were 
fixed based on contracts favouring Ryanair, which provided 95% of the passenger traffic at the airport at the time. It 
claimed that Ryanair had benefitted from particularly low fees due to reduced charges calculated based on the 
number of departing passengers and a subsidy known as "marketing support" granted where new routes were 
opened. Those measures were granted even though the airport was continuing to make losses. Lufthansa sought 
an order that the payments made to Ryanair through marketing support between 2002 and 2005 and those 
corresponding to the reduction in charges be recovered and that no future aid be granted to the budget carrier.
Since 2006, Lufthansa repeatedly unsuccessfully tried to reclaim the subsidies from Ryanair.
The German flag carrier last year also lost an appeal before the General Court of the European Union, where it took 
its case against Frankfurt-Hahn and Ryanair after the European Commission in 2014 gave the green light to a 
series of support measures for the airport.
Due to the parallel European component, the case was suspended several times over the past 17 years. The 
Koblenz Higher Regional Court confirmed the Commission's ruling on April 21, 2023.
According to the legal representative, the case now won at the Koblenz Higher Regional Court was not the only one 
in which such allegations of state aid were made against regional airports and their contracts with Ryanair, but 
because Ryanair had opened its largest hub at Frankfurt-Hahn Airport, this was probably the most significant case.
Lufthansa loses dispute over Frankfurt-Hahn's aid to Ryanair
Frankfurt-Hahn filed for bankruptcy on October 19, 2021, four years after an 82.5% stake was sold to China's HNA 
Group in 2017, while the German state of Hesse retained the rest. In June 2022, Frankfurt-based Swift Conjoy 
GmbH won the airport takeover tender, but as it failed to pay the required purchase price, the contract was 
dissolved in January 2023. Then, NR Holding, owned by Russian oligarch Viktor Kharitonin was expected to take 
over the airport, but creditors did not approve the sale to the billionaire. German real estate group Triwo AG won the 
renewed bidding process in February 2023. The company currently manages four airfields, including those of 
Oberpfaffenhofen and Zweibrücken.

Lufthansa (LH, Frankfurt International) has finally lost a decades-long court battle with Frankfurt Hahn over 
discounted airport fees and other favourable conditions granted to Irish budget carrier Ryanair (FR, Dublin 
International), which the German flag carrier argued breached European Union state aid laws.
In a judgement on April 21, 2023, the Koblenz Higher Regional Court rejected the airline's appeal against a first-
instance judgment of the Bad Kreuznach Regional Court of May 16, 2007, according to a report by Ryanair's legal 
representative in Germany's RWS Verlag.
The case dates back to 2006 when Lufthansa first brought legal action against Flughafen Frankfurt-Hahn GmbH, at 
the time the majority shareholder of the now insolvent airport. Lufthansa sought recovery of alleged aid the airport 
had granted to Ryanair. It essentially claimed that airport fees charged by Frankfurt-Hahn in 2001 and 2006 were 
fixed based on contracts favouring Ryanair, which provided 95% of the passenger traffic at the airport at the time. It 
claimed that Ryanair had benefitted from particularly low fees due to reduced charges calculated based on the 
number of departing passengers and a subsidy known as "marketing support" granted where new routes were 
opened. Those measures were granted even though the airport was continuing to make losses. Lufthansa sought 
an order that the payments made to Ryanair through marketing support between 2002 and 2005 and those 
corresponding to the reduction in charges be recovered and that no future aid be granted to the budget carrier.
Since 2006, Lufthansa repeatedly unsuccessfully tried to reclaim the subsidies from Ryanair.
The German flag carrier last year also lost an appeal before the General Court of the European Union, where it took 
its case against Frankfurt-Hahn and Ryanair after the European Commission in 2014 gave the green light to a

Ryanair and Repsol announced that they have signed a memorandum of understanding for the supply of 
sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at Irish low-cost hubs in Spain and Portugal.
This agreement will allow Ryanair access to 155,000 tonnes of SAF between 2025 and 2030, equivalent to more 
than 28,000 flights from Dublin to Madrid. The use of SAF will help reduce approximately 490,000 tonnes of CO2 
emissions.
"SAF plays a key role in Ryanair's Pathway to Net Zero strategy and our goal of using 12.5% SAF by 2030," 
Ryanair DAC's CEO Eddie Wilson said. "This agreement helps Ryanair secure access to c.15% of this ambitious 
goal."
In July 2022, Repsol began the construction of an advanced biofuels plant in the Spanish city of Cartagena, which 
will produce 250,000 tonnes of renewable fuels from waste. The new facilities are expected to come into operation 
in the first half of 2023. The company aims to produce over 2 million tons of renewable fuels by 2030.
"The aviation sector needs solutions such as SAF fuels to support the decarbonization process it is currently 
undergoing," Valero Marin, Executive Managing Director of Client at Repsol, said.

A journalist who was arrested by police after his plane was diverted and forced to land in Belarus has been jailed for 
eight years.
Roman Protasevich, 27, of Belarus, was on a Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania in May 2021, when the pilot 
was told by air traffic control that there was a bomb threat against the flight.
The Ryanair flight made an emergency landing in Minsk where Pratasevich, who lived in exile at the time, was 
taken by police.
The plane was checked for explosives but none were found, and the flight then continued to Lithuania, without 
Pratasevich.
The incident caused international outrage, with many questioning the authenticity of the bomb scare.
The Belta state news agency reported that on Wednesday, May 3, 2023, Pratasevich was imprisoned for offences 
that included organising mass disturbances, inciting acts of terrorism and slandering President Alexander 
Lukashenko.
Pratasevich worked as a journalist for news website Nexta which reported on mass protests against the 
Lukashenko regime after the election in 2020.
Pratasevich's partner at the time, Sofia Sapega, was also detained aboard the Ryanair flight and has already been 
sentenced to six years in prison.
According to Reuters, as Sapega is a Russian citizen, she is likely to be transferred there to serve her sentence.
Following his arrest in 2021, Pratasevich appeared on television admitting his involvement in trying to topple 
President Lukashenk.
It is widely believed these confessions were made under pressure from the police and government officials.

Highlight: Irish low-cost airline Ryanair entered a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on 4 May 2023 with the 
Spanish-based global energy company Repsol.
Body
The MoU signed by both companies is to advance the supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at Ryanair airports 
across Spain and Portugal. SAF, a renewable source, can be produced from resources such as forestry and 
agricultural waste, used cooking oil, carbon captured from the air and green hydrogen. According to the US 
Department of Energy, SAF can reduce the lifecycle of greenhouse gas emissions, which are responsible for 
approximately 2-3% of global carbon emissions. 
Through this partnership with Repsol, Ryanair will have access to up to 155,000 tonnes of SAF from 2025 to 2030, 
the equivalent of over 28,000 flights from Dublin to Madrid and a reduction of 490,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions. 
This deal illustrates both Ryanair and Repsol's commitment to cooperating and investing in SAF supply fuels. 
Ryanair has set itself its ambitious targets of utilising 12.5% SAF by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050. 
According to the Irish airline's 2022 sustainability report, their pathway to net-zero emissions by 2050 is one which 
aligns with the 2015 Paris Agreement and the Destination 2050 initiative. By using SAF, Ryanair can significantly 
reduce its carbon emissions and contribute to the industry's overall goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. In reference 
to Ryanair's environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings and membership report, they have received 
positive ratings from external ESG rating agencies such as MSCI and Sustainalytics. Indicating the company's 
efforts to address ESG concerns have been recognised and validated by independent experts. Ryanair DAC's CEO 
Eddie Wilson said: "SAF plays a key role in Ryanair's Pathway to Net Zero strategy and our goal of using 12.5% 
SAF by 2030. Achieving this requires multiple different feedstocks and production methods and we're encouraged 
that Repsol is looking at multiple solutions. This agreement helps Ryanair secure access to c.15% of this ambitious 
goal. "Repsol is a key sustainability partner for Ryanair and we look forward to building on this collaboration as our 
Group grows to carry 225 million passengers annually by FY26." This deal falls in with Repsol's Strategic Plan 
2021-2025 which pursues the company's transformation and sets the tone for accelerating the energy transition, 
following a cost-effective realistic path and ensuring future success for shareholders. Repsol's executive managing 
director Valero Marin added: "This collaboration agreement with Ryanair, Europe's leading passenger airline, 
Ryanair and Repsol enter major sustainable fuel agreement
reinforces our commitment to the aviation sector and it is another step in Repsol's commitment to renewable fuels. 
The aviation sector needs solutions such as SAF fuels to support the decarbonization process it is currently 
undergoing. "This also consolidates our position as a multi-energy company with the objective of achieving zero net 
emissions by 2050."

 In Spain, Repsol and Ryanair have signed a strategic agreement to promote the use of renewable fuels in Spain 
and Portugal[1]. Thanks to this alliance, both companies reinforce their role as relevant players in the

in Spain, in Cartagena (Region of Murcia). This plant will produce 250,000 tons of renewable fuels from waste, as 
part of the company's ambition to reach a production capacity of 1.3 million tons of renewable fuels by 2025 and 
more than 2 million tons by 2030, thus leading this market in the IberianPeninsula and making decisive progress 
towards the company's goal of reaching zero net emissions by 2050.

Ryanair yesterday said over 650 flights were cancelled due to the French Air Traffic Controller strikes in April, 
meaning almost 120,000 passengers couldn't fly. Flight traffic grew by 13 per cent year on year to 16mn guests 
overall, with the firm operating a total of 89,650 flights in April. The low-cost carrier saw load factor increase by 
three percentage points from April last year, rising to 94 per cent.
However, the firm acknowledged that last year's data was skewed by the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, 
which hit traffic. Since the first four months of 2023, there have been over 50 days of French ATC strikes, resulting 
in more than 3,700 cancellations. Ryanair has been one of the worst affected by the ATC action and recently 
published a petition, calling on the EU to take action to "keep skies open" when the action takes place.

Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) today received a lukewarm upgrade from analysts at Deutsche Bank, lifting its 
price target whilst not budging its recommendation for the European airline.
Deutsche pitched its new price target at 3,700p, up from 3250p, as it previewed upcoming financial results due next 
month (8th June).
"While we see a lot to like at Wizz and currently have a positive stance on the sector, we maintain our 'hold' rating, 
with more material potential upside elsewhere, most notably at Ryanair and the network airlines," the German bank 
said in a note.
It added: "Unlike at Ryanair, where we just increased our traffic forecasts, based on our latest cut of the capacity 
outlook and our load factor expectations, we are trimming our forecasts for Wizz in FY24 by 3% from 64.5m 
passengers to 62.5m (FY25 unchanged at ~75m).
"At the same time, however, we bring our yield forecasts into line with peers, assuming fares per pax +16% yoy this 
summer, together with a continued strong fares environment in FY25.
"This more than offsets and results in increases of 7% and 3% to our earnings (EBITDA) for FY24e and FY25e, 
respectively, which, in turn, drives the 14% increase in our TP from 3250p to 3700p implying over 20% potential 
upside to the shares."
In London, Wizz Air shares were priced around 1% lower on Wednesday changing hands at 3,016p each.

Wild growth in number of international travelers
There was more than spring weather at Aarhus Airport in April as 59% more passengers traveled to and from the 
Danish gateway's international destinations.
Record growth in passenger numbers - for the month of April a new record volume of customers used the Greater 
Aarhus airport, corresponding to a total passenger increase of +39% compared to the same month in 2022. The 
positive development also compares favourably with 2019's pre-pandemic international air traffic from and to 
overseas destinations.  In April 2023 this increased by +44% compared to 2019.
"This huge increase in passengers in April is a strong indicator for the coming months, when the summer travel 
period really comes in to force. It corresponds with a marked increase in the number of departures to existing 
destinations as well as the return of some reinstated services and the start of new routes,as well as very full flights. 
Business routes are back in good shape and frequency, both city-break and sunshine destinations are popular with 
increasingly motivated travelers and a rise in inbound visitors", says David Surley - director of route development 
and marketing at Aarhus Airport.
The number of international passengers increased by more than 12,000 month-on-month, placing Aarhus third 
among Danish airports. April was the first full month with brand new routes to Faro in Portugal and Palma de 
Mallorca, as newly serviced by the airport's largest airline partner - Ryanair - which also increased capacity to both 
London and Gdansk while resuming its schedule to Riga in Latvia. Swedish carrier BRA is flourishing on the daily 
route Aarhus-Stockholm, while SAS's Oslo route has regained the favour of business travellers. Bucharest, which 
Wizz Air commenced in late 2022 has been very well received by Greater Aarhus travellers, while the Egyptian 
destinations of Sharm el Sheikh and Hurghada have also attracted a particularly large increase in sun-seeking 
guests from all around mainland Denmark and reflected in April's compelling results.
The airport expects the positive development to continue, predicting it will soon no longer be relevant to compare 
with pre-pandemic times:
"We can soon put the time of benchmarking towards 2019 behind us. We are experiencing great demand for classic 
destinations while continuing to fully restore our route map offer. We are seeing new trends, guests have changed 
travel patterns and they are looking for new travel inspiration. We therefore work continually to fully restore 
Aruba Airport adds first 100% electric airport bus to its fleet
connectivity in line with demand, while at the same time innovating with new exciting destinations", continues David 
Surley.
On the summer schedule ahead is the new Swedish destination of Visby on Gotland, which BRA has just 
announced, along with favourites Milan, Zadar, Corfu, Malaga, Preveza, Chania, Zakynthos, Cyprus and Bornholm 
among others. Tour operator Spies is gearing up with new flights to Mallorca and Gran Canaria, while Gislev Rejser 
has put Naples in to place for the autumn. Additionally, July onwards sees Ryanair further increase the number of 
double-daily departures to London.

Roman Protasevich, a prominent blogger and critic of the authoritarian Belarusian government whose 2021 arrest 
caused international outrage, was sentenced to eight years in a prison camp by a court in Minsk on Wednesday.
Prosecutors had accused the 27-year-old blogger of plotting to seize power, among other things, according to 
Belarusian state news agency Belta.
Protasevich, who used to be editor-in-chief of the opposition blog Nexta, is widely viewed internationally as a 
political prisoner.
His spectacular arrest in May 2021 caused outrage around the world. He was on a flight from Greece to Lithuania 
with his then-girlfriend Sofia Sapega when the Belarusian authorities forced the Ryanair plane to land in Minsk 
because of what they claimed was a bomb threat.
Both the blogger and Sapega were promptly arrested and imprisoned. Sapega, who is a Russian citizen, was 
sentenced to six years in prison.
After his arrest, Protasevich appeared several times on Belarusian state television, where he distanced himself from 
his opposition activities. However, relatives believe that his statements were coerced under immense pressure and 
possible torture.
Belarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko, who is also a close confidant of Russian President Vladimir Putin, 
has led a brutal and severe crackdown on political opponents and critics, especially after widespread anti-regime 
protests in the summer of 2020.

THE AVIATION industry is looking forward to a surge in demand this summer, with major airlines forecasting 
bumper profits for 2023.
Flights will surge this summer, with airlines rapidly closing in on pre-pandemic levels amid an uplift in departures, 
according to data shared with City A.M. by analytics firm Cirium.
Ryanair, Jet2, Virgin Atlantic and Easyjet are all predicted to see increases in departures in the third quarter when 
compared with 2019. Jet2 expects the highest rise, with departures set to reach 119 per cent of its previous total. 
British Airways is forecast to hit 88 per cent of pre-pandemic levels.
Overall, UK departures are expected to reach 90 per cent of 2019 levels with over 49m flight seats filled, 
representing a near full recovery, Cirium's figures show.
Lufthansa's director of sales Heinrich Lange told City A.M. "special effects" such as "pent-up demand" after years of 
restrictions as well as the recent reopening of China and Japan were to thank for the travel boom.
Lange added the Lufthansa Group has already added 20 per cent capacity for flights, with the company doing "a lot 
of preparation", including investing in more staff for the coming months.
Deidre Fulton, an analyst at the intelligence company OAG, said that "there's no doubt that demand is certainly 
strong". Holidaymakers have remained unperturbed by the cost of living crisis, she explained, with many "still 
prioritising travel".
Sun-seeking Brits to power airline recovery
It comes as OAG data showed Brits were particularly keen to travel, with the UK set for the sharpest recovery in in 
aviation demand in western Europe this summer.

Lithuania to land in Minsk.Raman Pratasevich, the opposition journalist who was arrested after his Ryanair flight 
was forced to land in Belarus almost two years ago, was sentenced to eight years in prison on Wednesday.The 27-
year-old was arrested in May 2021 after the plane he was on - flying from Greece to Lithuania - was told to land in 
Minsk as it flew over Belarus, Pratasevich&#39;s home country. The incident sparked international outrage.He was 
charged with over 1,500 crimes including organizing unrest and plotting to seize power. The blogger had 
maintained a Telegram channel, Nexta, that was used to organize the large-scale protests that broke out after the 
August 2020 elections that were widely condemned as fraudulent.The Minsk regional court has sentenced Roman 
Pratasevich to eight years in a prison colony, Belarusian state news agency Belta said.Pratasevich&#39;s outrage-

When the plane landed, authorities took Pratasevich, his girlfriend and two others. The plane then left without

involved in the Nexta Telegram channel, Stepan Putilo and Yan Rudnik, were also sentenced to 20 and 19 years in

also further stoked tensions with the EU, three members of which - Poland, Latvia and Lithuania - share a border 
with Belarus.The situation deteriorated amid a series of sanctions and a so-called hybrid war in which Belarusian 
authorities flew in migrants and sent them to cross the border into the EU.Minsk&#39;s closeness to Moscow, upon 
which Lukashenko&#39;s power is entirely reliant, has further isolated the former Soviet republic, especially since

In May 2021, Raman Pratasevich was arrested after a forced landing of a Ryanair plane in Minsk. He publicly 
regretted his pro-opposition work but has been sentenced to prison on charges of conspiring against the state.Eight 
years in a prison colony - that is the sentence handed down to Raman Pratasevich by a court in Minsk on May 3. 
The blogger was charged with organizing riots, incitement to hatred, founding an extremist group, conspiracy to 
seize power and publicly slandering President Alexander Lukashenko. Pratasevich, who turns 28 two days after the 
verdict, was under house arrest in Belarus for almost two years.Pratasevich was arrested on May 23, 2021, while 
on a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius with his girlfriend at the time, Sofia Sapega. When the plane entered 
Belarusian airspace, controllers in Minsk warned the pilots that there was a bomb on board.A Belarusian fighter jet 
escorted the plane until its forced landing in Minsk - where the blogger was immediately detained. 
The International Civil Aviation Organization later determined that it was an intentional false bomb alert.Who is 
Raman Pratasevich? Pratasevich was a freelance journalist in Belarus for Radio Liberty and Euroradio until 2020, 
followed by a position as editor-in-chief for the Telegram channel Nexta. Nexta had more than 2.1 million followers. 
It broadcast reports about the mass protests against Lukashenko and the rigged presidential election and police 
violence in August 2020. Demonstrations were announced on Nexta, too.From the end of September 2020, 
Pratasevich directed the Belarus Golovnogo Mosga (Belarus in the Brain) Telegram channel. Both channels were 
listed as extremist by Belarusian authorities. Pratasevich lived in exile, first in Poland, then in Lithuania.After 
Pratasevich&#39;s arrest, the Belarus ONT state broadcaster aired two interviews with him. In the first, bruises and 
traces of handcuffs were visible on his wrists, and in the second, Pratasevich said he felt great. He made 
controversial statements and mentioned the names of people who joined chats where protest actions were 
discussed - some of them were in Belarus at the time. It is unclear under what circumstances the conversations 
were recorded. Pratasevich&#39;s lawyer unsuccessfully demanded a medical examination to rule out the use of 
physical force and torture.&#39;Voluntary cooperation&#39; with investigatorsIn June 2021, the Belarusian Foreign 
Ministry held a briefing designed to convince journalists and diplomats that the forced landing of the Ryanair plane 
was lawful. Surprisingly, Raman Pratasevich was present for the briefing after spending weeks in a KGB 
investigative prison. Pratasevich told the journalists that he was cooperating voluntarily with the investigators, but 
made it clear that he did not support Lukashenko.Tatyana Korovenkova, a reporter for the BelaPAN non-state news 
agency, addressed Pratasevich: Raman, I have sincere sympathy with you, as do many of your colleagues in 
Belarus. I can imagine what was done to you. I don&#39;t believe a single word you say. Hang in there.Interviews 
and a wedding under house arrestDespite the serious charges, Pratasevich was moved to house arrest, and had

access to social networks and messenger services. In January 2022, he announced that he was cooperating with 
the so-called human rights center Sistemnaya Pravozashchita, an organization created by a pro-Russian activist 
during the migration crisis on the border between Belarus and the EU.Pratasevich gave interviews and hosted 
streams. He told his followers that only the authorities in question can give an assessment of certain events. He 
said he was an ideological fool in the summer and fall of 2020. He criticized the democratic forces and called the 
2020 protests a mistake.He said he regretted that Sofia Sapega happened to get involved, too. In May 2022, just 
three days after Sapega was sentenced to six years in prison, he announced he had married someone 
else.Hostage turns supporter of the regime?His trial started on February 16, 2023 in Minsk. Pratasevich was 
allowed to attend without handcuffs. He was not confined to a cage, which is unusual in Belarus. During the 
hearings, Pratasevich testified against his former colleagues, Nexta editors Stepan Putilo and Jan Rudnik, as well 
as against blogger Eduard Palchis and political scientist Valerya Kostyugova, who was sentenced to 10 years in 
prison in March.In public, Pratasevich denied pressure from the Belarusian authorities. He said he regrets 
everything, and that his views have changed. Some of his statements prompted controversial reactions.Many 
condemn Pratasevich, but I can&#39;t, says Tatyana Korovenkova, the reporter who addressed him at the briefing 
two years ago. I will not cast stones at him because I was not in his position. I don&#39;t know how I would have 
acted myself in such a situation, she says, adding that people who have not experienced such pressure have no 
moral right to condemn him. The prison conditions for political prisoners are appalling, she says, hard to bear for 
someone who has not spent years getting ready to fight the regime.The main thing is to save yourself and get out of 
there as soon as possible with minimal damage to your health, mind and body, she argues.People are of two minds 
about Pratasevich after his confessions and expressions of remorse, says Grigory Nizhinkov, a political scientist. 
He says people should not forget his current situation, arguing the blogger&#39;s public behavior is due to the fact 
that he is a hostage in Belarus. His behavior is the strategy he has chosen. It is difficult to condemn him or judge 
him in any way. After all, everyone knows what the Belarusian regime is all about, says Nizhinkov.This article was 
originally written in Russian.

Pratasevich gave interviews and hosted streams. He told his followers that "only the authorities in question can give 
an assessment of certain events." He said he was "an ideological fool" in the summer and fall of 2020. He criticized 
the democratic forces and called the 2020 protests a mistake. 
He said he regretted that Sofia Sapega happened to get involved, too. In May 2022, just three days after Sapega 
was sentenced to six years in prison, he announced he had married someone else. 
Hostage turns supporter of the regime? 
His trial started on February 16, 2023 in Minsk. Pratasevich was allowed to attend without handcuffs. He was not 
confined to a cage, which is unusual in Belarus. During the hearings, Pratasevich testified against his former 
colleagues, Nexta editors Stepan Putilo and Jan Rudnik, as well as against blogger Eduard Palchis and political 
scientist Valerya Kostyugova, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison in March. 
In public, Pratasevich denied pressure from the Belarusian authorities. He said he regrets everything, and that his 
views have changed. Some of his statements prompted controversial reactions. 
"Many condemn Pratasevich, but I can't," says Tatyana Korovenkova, the reporter who addressed him at the 
briefing two years ago. "I will not cast stones at him because I was not in his position. I don't know how I would have 
acted myself in such a situation," she says, adding that people who have not experienced such pressure have no 
moral right to condemn him. The prison conditions for political prisoners are appalling, she says, "hard to bear for 
someone who has not spent years getting ready to fight the regime." 
"The main thing is to save yourself and get out of there as soon as possible with minimal damage to your health, 
mind and body," she argues. 
People are of two minds about Pratasevich after his "confessions" and "expressions of remorse," says Grigory 
Nizhinkov, a political scientist. He says people should not forget his current situation, arguing the blogger's public 
behavior is due to the fact that he is a hostage in Belarus. "His behavior is the strategy he has chosen. It is difficult 
to condemn him or judge him in any way. After all, everyone knows what the Belarusian regime is all about," says 
Nizhinkov.

May 03, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported highly impressive traffic numbers for the month of April driven by upbeat air-
travel demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in April was 16 million. This compared 
favorably with the March figure of 12.6 million and the year-ago number of 14.2 million. 
Per a Reuters report[2], it was only the third time ever that Ryanair had carried 16 million or more passengers on its 
flights in a month. In July and August 2021, 16.8 million and 16.9 million people were transported on RYAAY flights, 
respectively. 
Owing to the upbeat traffic, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was as high as 94% in April 
compared with 91% a year ago. Passenger volume in April was high despite the French air traffic control strikes 
that resulted in the cancellation of more than 650 flights. 
Owing to buoyant air-travel demand, shares of Ryanair have gained 41.6% over the past six months compared with 
the 1% uptick of the Zacks Airline[3] industry. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Ryanair expects to cut some flights in July and August due to delivery delays from Boeing. Zacks Rank & Key Picks 
Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Airline industry are Alaska Air Group ALK[4] and 
United Airlines UAL[5], each carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 
(Strong Buy) Rank stocks here[6]. 
On the back of upbeat air-travel demand and favorable pricing, Alaska Air's top line increased 31% year over year 
in the March quarter. The company expects to boost its fleet and workforce in 2023 to meet the anticipated high 
demand. ALK expects second-quarter 2023 total revenues to increase 2.5-5.5% from the second-quarter 2022 
actuals. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Alaska Air's current-year earnings has been revised upward by 6.9% in the past 
60 days. 
United Airlines is seeing steady recovery in domestic and leisure air-travel demand. Owing to robust air-travel 
demand, UAL expects revenues for the June quarter to grow 14-16% year over year. 
For 2023, United Airlines expects capacity to be in the high teens. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year 
earnings has been revised upward by more than 8% in the past 60 days.

Boeing , Airbus delays to keep hitting airlines for years
Boeing, Airbus delays to keep hitting airlines for years

Delays from aircraft suppliers Airbus Group (EPA:AIR) and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) could last for years, 
according to industry members, marking bad news for the recovering sector.
US company Air Lease Corp confirmed on Monday that Boeing and Airbus had issued "additional notices of delay" 
over deliveries due for 2023 and 2024 in "recent weeks".
"One [...] has advised us to expect delays compared to originally contracted delivery dates through 2028," the 
company's chief executive, John Plueger told investors on a call.
Both manufacturers admitted in April that output of narrow-body jets from the A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX 
families looked set to be hit going forward.
Comments from Air Lease suggest these woes may continue for longer than expected though, with Airbus originally 
anticipating just three-month delays by 2024 due to supply chain bottlenecks left over from the pandemic.
Boeing did not clarify how long shortfalls would continue but suggested a "significant" number of 737 shipments 
would suffer delays in the short term over quality issues with fuselage parts from supplier Spirit AeroSystems.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) boss Michael O'Leary had already raised doubts over Boeing's ability to meet 
orders late last year as the value carrier awaited delivery of 210 737s, signed for in December 2020.
Despite hinting towards a new deal with Boeing in March, O'Leary reiterated shortfalls from the supplier meant 
"some flights" would "certainly" have to be trimmed in coming months.
Boeing , Airbus delays to keep hitting airlines for years
Rival easyJet PLC is awaiting deliveries of 135 A320neo jets and 33 larger A321neos from Airbus meanwhile, with 
these expected between 2026 and 2029 as the supplier clears a backlog of 8,600 variants of the jet from 2021.
Airbus shares slipped 0.3% to (EURO)126.7 on the news.

A passenger aboard a Ryanair flight chose to crawl down the steps of the aircraft at Gothenburg-Landvetter Airport 
(GOT) after he was told assistance could take an hour to arrive.
Adrian Keogh, from the Republic of Ireland, landed at the airport on April 29, 2023, at around 11pm but was 
informed he could be waiting until midnight for a mobile lift to arrive.
Keogh, who has a spinal injury after an accident and had been in a wheelchair since 2015, did not want to wait that 
long due to being in pain from the journey and decided to crawl down the aircraft stairs.
"This is not the first time I've been stuck on a plane after everyone else has disembarked," the 37-year-old 
passenger told the BBC. "It's unacceptable. All I ask for is to be able to travel with dignity."
Keogh posted a photo of himself making his way down the aircraft stairs and wrote how upset he was about the 
experience.
Ryanair said it was investigating the incident, and that special assistance at the airport was provided by a third 
party.
A spokesperson for Landvetter Airport told AeroTime that it "deeply regretted" Mr. Keogh's experience at the 
airport.
"Due to several unforeseen events the assistance service at the airport was affected with longer waiting times and 
not up to our usual standard of service, although airport procedures were followed," the spokesperson said. "As a 
consequence, the assistance service was delayed however by no means 'forgotten'. Again, we are very sorry for 
Mr. Keogh's inconvenience. "

Ryanair plans cashflow financing for Max 10 order

Ryanair Holdings will not deviate from its strategy to mainly use its balance sheet to fund its new aircraft deliveries 
with the Boeing 737 Max 10 model.
The Irish carrier has placed an order for 300 new Boeing 737 Max 10 aircraft for delivery over a six-year period 
between 2027 and 2033. The order includes 150 firm for the 228-seat model as well as 150 options.
Given the strength of the Ryanair Group's balance sheet, its industry leading credit rating and the approximately 
two-year gap between the last delivery of 197-seat 737-8200 aircraft in financial year 2025, and the first Max in 
financial year 2027, the Group anticipates that capital expenditure will be substantially funded from internal 
cashflows, although it remains opportunistic in its fleet financing strategy.
As of 8 May, Ryanair had received 103 737-8200 out of 210 units under its 2014 contract agreement with Boeing.
Net debt at 31 December 2022 was (EURO)960 million ($1.1 billion), down from (EURO)1.45 billion as of 31 March 
2022, while cash amounted to (EURO)4.1 billion at the end of the December quarter.
The company has issued two Euro-denominated bonds, for an aggregate nominal amount of (EURO)2.05 billion 
since 2020, and has a (EURO)750 million bond maturing in August this year. Last July it signed up to (EURO)6 
billion Euro medium term note programme with Citigroup Global Markets as global coordinator. BNP Paribas and 
Citigroup Global Markets acted as arrangers of the programme. Dealers are Barclays Bank Ireland, BNP Paribas, 
Citigroup Global Markets Europe, Citigroup Global Markets, Commerzbank, Credit Agricole-CIB, Goldman Sachs 
International, Goodbody Stockbrokers, ING Bank, J&E Davy, NatWest Markets, SMBC Bank, Societe Generale and 
Standard Chartered Bank.
The Irish carrier says the new Max 10 deliveries will facilitate disciplined traffic growth of 80% from 168 million 
passengers in year-end March 2023 to 300 million by March 2034. Ryanair expects 50% of these deliveries will 
replace older 737NGs, which will allow Ryanair to continue to operate one of Europe's youngest, most fuel efficient, 
and environmentally sustainable aircraft fleets.
"The Boeing-Ryanair partnership is one of the most productive in commercial aviation history, enabling both 
companies to succeed and expand affordable travel to hundreds of millions of people. Nearly a quarter century after 
our companies signed our first direct airplane purchase, this landmark deal will further strengthen our partnership. 
Ryanair plans cashflow financing for Max 10 order
We are committed to delivering for Ryanair and helping Europe's largest airline group achieve its goals by offering 
its customers the lowest fares in Europe," commented Boeing president and chief executive officer Dave Calhoun.
Ryanair says that given the size and scale of the transaction, the order will be subject to shareholder approval at 
Ryanair's 14 September annual general meeting.

Ryanair will continue to use its own cash resources for unsecured bond repayments at maturity. The Irish low-cost 
carrier anticipates the next bond repayment, scheduled for 15 August 2023, to be fully met with its own cash 
resources.
Chief financial officer Neil Sorahan tells Airfinance Journal that Ryanair "expects to repay it from our cash 
resources".
Ryanair issued the six-and-a-half-year senior unsecured (EURO)750 million (($803 million, at the time) bond in 
February 2017 as part of its (EURO)3 billion Euro medium term notes (EMTN) programme, with BNP Paribas, 
Citigroup, Credit Agricole-CIB acting as bookrunners.
The 1.125% bond saw initial pricing talk at MS+105/110 basis points (bps). Guidance was MS+95 bps area. The 
issuance launched at MS+92 bps.
This year Ryanair has (EURO)1.6 billion worth of unsecured bonds maturing.
The carrier repaid its March 2015 senior unsecured notes issuance on 10 March using cash, according to Sorahan. 
That (EURO)850 million eight-year bond set a new pricing record for the aviation industry at a 1.125% 
coupon. Initial pricing on the deal was around MS+80bps area -which would have been a record by itself, but 
increased demand helped lower the price to MS+67bps. BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Agricole-CIB acted as joint-
bookrunners on the transaction.
That issuance marked Ryanair's second unsecured Eurobond transaction following its successful debut seven-year 
(EURO)850 million Eurobond in June 2014.
Zero debt by 2024 The carrier's net debt totalled (EURO)960 million at 31 December 2022 and Ryanair is aiming for 
zero net debt by the end of its financial year 2024 (to 31 March 2024).
Ryanair said it has strong cash flow to repay bonds and fund future capital expenditures. Capital expenditures for its 
financial year 2023 were revised to (EURO)2 billion, versus (EURO)2.3 billion previously budgeted as a result of the 
timing of deliveries.
How Ryanair repays maturing bonds
Its financial year 2024 capital expenditure is now expected to be around (EURO)2.5 billion, compared with 
(EURO)2.2 billion previously budgeted.
Ryanair was expecting to end its financial year 2023 (to 31 March 2023) with 99 Boeing 737-8200s. It had 61 737-
8200s at 31 March 2022.
Over the past nine years, Ryanair has mainly financed its new deliveries through a combination of the proceeds 
from its bond activity and cash resources.
The carrier has tapped the capital markets five times, raising a total of (EURO)4.5 billion since 2014. It has two 
unsecured bonds outstanding: a 2.875% (EURO)850 million maturing on 15 September 2025 and a 0.875% 
(EURO)1.2 billion maturing on 26 May 2026.
Last summer Ryanair amended its EMTN programme to (EURO)6 billion.
"We will update the EMTN programme (as we do every year) later this summer. The Group will remain opportunistic 
in its financing strategy," comments Sorahan.

Lower aircraft ownership costs in a rising interest rate environment put Ryanair in a strong position going forward as 
its fleet is fully owned and 99% unencumbered, the low-cost carrier has said.
"Thanks to the renegotiations with Boeing during the Max grounding, we have seen a substantial widening of our 
ownership and maintenance costs versus our competitors, most of whom are operating entirely leased fleets, or 
they went into Covid refinancing through leasing," Ryanair Group chief executive officer Michael O'Leary said 
during an earnings call.
"As we move into an environment where there are higher rates and financing costs, our competitors will be facing 
significantly higher cost of ownership in the next couple of years, whereas ours will be kept low."
O'Leary anticipates a "fundamental shift" in European aviation towards Ryanair, driven by this cost advantage as 
well as its ability to enter markets across Europe if the airport slots are accessible.
He also noted a "huge surge" in business travel, in particular in markets such as Eastern Europe and Italy.
"There is a strong desire for businesses in Europe to go back to work, with a lot of demand in Eastern Europe as 
supply chains switch from Asia to closer to Europe," he added.
"On short haul European, premium traffic is over. No-one will pay for business travel across Europe as they do less 
and less across the transatlantic," O'Leary said.

Turkish Airlines eyes 600-aircraft order
Turkish Airlines eyes 600-aircraft order

Istanbul-headquartered Turkish Airlines has confirmed that discussions are underway with aircraft and engine 
manufacturers for a mammoth 600 aircraft order, including 200 widebody and 400 narrowbody aircraft.
The Turkish order, which would include options, would be the largest in the industry's history if placed, exceeding 
the previous record order by Air India for 470 Airbus and Boeing aircraft placed in December last year.
Turkish Airlines is targeting a fleet of 435 aircraft by the end of 2023 with long term plans to nearly double that 
number to 800 aircraft by 2033.
Turkish Airlines' current backlog is small compared with its previously announced growth trajectory. It had unfilled 
orders for nine Boeing 787-9s, 49 Airbus A321neos and 14 A350-900s as of 30 April 2023, according to data from 
the OEMs.
Air India's commitment announced last year with Airbus includes 140 A320neo and 70 A321neo aircraft as well as 
six A350-900s and 34 A350-1000s.
Firm commitments between Air India and Boeing include 190 737 Max variants, 10 777Xs and 20 787-9s. Options 
are in place for 50 additional Max aircraft and 20 additional 787-9s.
Irish carrier Ryanair Group has also recently placed an order for 300 new 737 Max 10 aircraft for delivery over a six-
year period between 2027 and 2033. The order includes 150 firm for the 228-seat model as well as 150 options.
As for Turkish Airlines, it has already taken delivery of 32 737 Max 8s, seven of which are leased from BOC 
Aviation. In 2021 the company cancelled orders for 10 737 Max aircraft out of a total order for 75 aircraft of the type, 
while also converting 40 aircraft into options after reaching an agreement with Boeing.
Late last year Turkish Airlines agreed a financing with Avolon covering five A321neos. Turkish now operates 40 
A321neo aircraft but still no A320neos. Turkish's A321neo lessor pool also includes Mitsui & Co, SMBC Aviation 
Capital and CMB Financial Leasing, according to Airfinance Journal's Fleet Tracker.
The group plans 36 deliveries and three aircraft exits in 2023 - 12 of these deliveries are widebodies and the 
remainder are mostly new-generation narrowbodies.

EU state aid repercussions
EU state aid repercussions
AirFinance Journal
May 2023

Length: 865 words
Byline: Hugh Davies
Body
Recent decisions by the General Court (GC) of the Court of Justice of the European Union to uphold appeals to 
annul European Commission Covid-19 aid approvals for European carriers may have implications for state aid 
assessments and allocations in future downturns.
An appeal made by Ryanair against the Commission's decision to grant Lufthansa state aid was upheld earlier this 
month on the grounds that the Commission infringed key requirements laid down in its own temporary framework, 
including failing to assess whether Lufthansa could have raised part of the necessary Covid-19 financing on the 
capital markets.
Watson Farley & Williams Italy Of Counsel Matteo Castioni told Airfinance Journal that it is unclear if and how the 
GC ruling will have any immediate impact on Lufthansa, given that the company has already repaid the entirety of 
the aid.
However, he argued that the long-term consequences will be significant, especially as the Commission comes to 
terms with aid requests in the aviation sector as well as in other industries heavily favouring French and German 
companies.
"The GC rulings may have far-reaching consequences for any future state bailouts at a time when several EU 
member states are keen to ease state aid rules to allow states to support strategically important sectors," he 
commented.
"Obviously the Commission did a very poor job on the Lufthansa decision three years ago," Ryanair's chief legal 
and regulatory officer Juliusz Komorek commented during a recent earnings call.
"The focus now is converting that victory into something tangible," he added.
The Commission approved a recapitalisation scheme for Lufthansa for (EURO)6 billion ($6.4 billion) to restore the 
balance sheet position and liquidity of the German carrier.
The measure included an equity participation of approximately (EURO)300 million, a non-convertible government 
silent participation of approximately (EURO)4.7 billion and another silent participation of (EURO)1 billion with the 
EU state aid repercussions
features of a convertible debt instrument. The measure was part of a wider scheme that included guarantees, loans 
and liquidity support.
Ryanair's Komorek said however that the "damage to competition has already been done because Lufthansa 
managed to hold onto all their slots and aircraft".
The General Court observed that nothing in the contested decision indicated that the Commission assessed the 
possible availability of collateral, such as Lufthansa's unencumbered aircraft, their value and the terms for any loans 
that it may have obtained on the financial markets against such collateral.
Meanwhile, other airlines sold and leased back aircraft assets to raise cash in the short term.
"When you compare their situation to someone like Easyjet who rely on sale and leaseback for the majority of their 
fleet to survive, the damage has been done," Komorek noted.
On the same day of the Lufthansa ruling, the court annulled a similar state aid measure notified by Denmark and 
Sweden in support of the Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), on the basis that the recapitalisation scheme did not include 
sufficient measures to incentivise the Swedish and Danish governments to exit quickly.
Earlier this month, the General Court also annulled an additional decision authorising an aid scheme of (EURO)130 
million compensating airlines with an Italian operating license for damage suffered during the Covid-19 pandemic.
What can the Commission do when reissuing decisions to repair some of the damage?
"What springs to mind are slots in places like Frankfurt, Munich, Dusseldorf or Vienna where Lufthansa is in a very 
strong position but never had to surrender anything in exchange for this massive state bailout," Komorek argued.
WFW's Castioni said similar rulings for other European carriers may be adopted in the coming months as the court 
adopts a more rigorous approach in scrutinising the Commission's State aid decisions.
"The GC is currently assessing aid schemes granted by France to Air France-KLM under the temporary framework, 
which according to the competitors that appealed the measures, were granted on the basis of the same faulty 
premises of the decisions that approved the German scheme and should therefore be annulled accordingly," 
Castioni continued.
The Commission authorised over (EURO)7 billion of French and Dutch state aid measures for Air France and KLM 
in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which have only recently been refinanced.
In March 2023, Air France-KLM fully redeemed the outstanding (EURO)2.5 billion bank loan guaranteed by the 
French State by using the proceeds of the sustainability-linked bonds and (EURO)1.5 billion of liquidity.
The Group also repaid and refinanced (EURO)300 million of the (EURO)600 million outstanding perpetual hybrid 
bonds held by the French State in March.
KLM signed a (EURO)1 billion revolving credit facility with a four-year tenor last month, replacing both the remaining 
direct loan granted to KLM by the Dutch State and the credit facility guaranteed by the Dutch State, both of which 
were cancelled by the carrier.
The facility includes two one-year extension options and provides for a (EURO)200 million accordion increase 
option at the lenders' discretion.

Ryanair has converted its unsecured (EURO)750 million ($810 million) syndicated term loan into a revolving credit 
facility at a lower margin with an extended maturity to May 2028 from 2024.
This follows the repayment of its (EURO)850 million bond in March 2023.
Aside from a (EURO)750 million bond maturing in Agust this year, Ryanair has a (EURO)850 million bond due in 
September 2025 and (EURO)1.2 billion bond due in May 2026.
"We still have about (EURO)3 billion in debt to repay in the next three years. There are still significant funding 
challenges ahead, but we are confident we can deal with them," Ryanair Group chief executive officer Michael 
O'Leary said during an earnings call.
The company reported net cash of (EURO)560 million as of 31 March 2023, versus net debt of (EURO)1.45 billion 
as of 31 March 2022. This includes over (EURO)1.9 billion of capital expenditure during the fiscal year ended 31 
March 2023.
Ryanair said in the coming months it will repay a (EURO)750 million maturing bond in August and fund over 
(EURO)2.6 billion of capital expenditure while planning to retain a broadly flat net cash/debt position.
The group said it expects capital expenditure will be funded primarily through cash for deliveries in late 2024 and for 
Boeing 737 Max 10 deliveries in early 2027.
"We will continue to preserve cash to minimise financing costs as we face considerable annual aircraft capex of 
over (EURO)2 billion per annum from 2027 onwards," the group stated.
Almost all the group's Boeing 737 fleet are owned and 99% are unencumbered.
Ryanair swung to a profit of (EURO)1.4 billion last year from a loss of (EURO)355 million in fiscal-year 2022.
The company generated (EURO)10.8 billion of revenue in the 12 months ended 31 March 2023, an increase of 
124% year on year, on the back of strong passenger demand.
Ryanair converts unsecured loan
Ryanair carried 169 million passengers during the 12-month period, an increase of 74% year on year and 14% 
higher than in fiscal year 2020 prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Total operating costs rose 75% to (EURO)9.2 billion, driven by higher fuel costs (+113% to (EURO)3.9 billion), 
offset by favourable fuel hedges and improved fuel burn due to new 737 Max aircraft in the fleet.
Earlier this month, Ryanair signed an agreement to purchase 300 new Boeing 737 Max 10 aircraft (150 firm and 
150 options), which is subject to AGM approval on 14 September 2023, with phased deliveries between 2027 and 
2033.
Ryanair expects to be 10 737 Max deliveries short for the summer 2023 season due to ongoing delivery delays.
"To facilitate Boeing, and to assist their resumption of scheduled B-8200 deliveries this autumn, we will take 
delivery of aircraft through July (and possibly into August). We hope and expect that Boeing will recover quickly 
from this recent delay to minimise its impact on our FY24 traffic growth and profitability," Ryanair stated.

San Francisco-based BBAM has agreed a lease deal with new Thai cargo specialist Budget Lines.
BBAM has placed a Boeing 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighter (BCF) with the start-up.
According to Airfinance Journal's Fleet Tracker it manages the 737BCF on behalf of Incline Aviation.
In March, BBAM closed its latest flagship aircraft leasing fund, Incline Aviation II, with total capital commitments of 
approximately $1.5 billion. A diverse group of institutional investors committed to Incline Aviation II, including some 
of the world's largest public and private employee pension plans and sovereign wealth funds.
The new 737BCF for Budget Lines is held under Incline II as well. The 2003-vintage aircraft spent its entire 
passenger aircraft life with Ryanair.
Fleet Tracker notes that BBAM now has 16 converted 737 freighters placed with customers, including on lease to 
Air Incheon, Westjet Cargo, World Cargo Airlines, as well as new entrants like Camex Airlines and Thailand's 
Budget Lines.
BBAM has more than 450 aircraft and $21 billion of assets under management.

JP Morgan predicts a bright summer for European airlines, driven by strong consumer demand for travel and limited 
capacity compared to 2019, according to a research note.
The investment bank expects that the focus will shift to the strength of pricing and profitability during the summer 
months.
Although estimates have been revised upwards, the combination of a relatively stable fuel environment and yield 
outperformance leaves room for further earnings upgrades across the sector.
Despite a 30% increase in the sector's year-to-date collective share price performance, a significant re-rating has 
not occurred, making valuation multiples appear attractive, the bank said in a note.
JP Morgan has upgraded easyJet PLC to 'neutral' from 'underweight', as strong revenue momentum leads to large 
estimate upgrades.
However, the bank sees better value in Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA), which trades below easyJet's estimated 
2024 price-to-earnings ratio.
Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) is placed on a 'positive catalyst watch', with potential upgrades for the year 
ending March 2024.
easyJet , Ryanair , IAG: Leading bank predicts bright summer for airlines
Ryanair remains JP Morgan's highest conviction 'overweight' pick, with Lufthansa and Air France-KLM 
(OTC:AFLYY) also rated 'overweight'. The bank maintains a 'neutral' rating on International Consolidated Airlines 
Group SA (LSE:IAG).

The Italian association of tour operators and travel agencies (FIAVET) has begun legal action against Ryanair (FR, 
Dublin International) over its contentious intermediary sales policies, arguing that it has become "impossible" for 
travel agents to sell the budget carrier's tickets.
FIAVET claims Ryanair has a cumbersome passenger identity verification system, including a for-fee service 
involving facial recognition and providing a copy of the passenger's identification documentation or collecting a copy 
of the passenger's signature and identification documentation using the no-fee process.
"The problems of subjecting the passenger to facial recognition (think of the tickets purchased for groups such as 
for educational trips) become an obstacle to the possibility of purchasing for the agency," reads an April 20 FIAVET 
statement. The trade group claims Ryanair needs to recognise that travel agents operate as agents of passengers, 
not of airlines.
FIAVET says its national council has unanimously decided to commence legal action against Ryanair to protect the 
rights of travel agents and passengers. "We have been dealing with this thorny issue for years. In the past, we have 
challenged, with various warnings to Ryanair, incorrect behaviour towards travel agents," says Giuseppe Ciminnisi, 
the President of Fiavet Confcommercio.
Ryanair goes to considerable lengths to prevent shop front and online travel agents from selling their seats. While 
the low-cost carrier does distinguish between authorised and unauthorised resellers in its terms and conditions, 
FIAVET says the passenger identification process is unworkable even for authorised agents.
A Swiss court recently ruled in favour of an online travel agency in a long-running case against Ryanair concerning 
the scrapping of data from the airline's website and the reselling of tickets - a practice Ryanair's terms and 
conditions explicitly forbid. Following that ruling, Ryanair said the decision would have no practical outcome on their 
policies. In 2011, FIAVET took action against Ryanair and obtained a compensation order. "But now, we are once 
again forced to deliberate a judicial action to defend the sacrosanct right to be able to purchase Ryanair tickets," 
says Ciminnisi. ch-aviation has approached Ryanair for comment.

Southwest's slowing MAX deliveries
Southwest's slowing MAX deliveries

Apr 27, 2023( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Today's news[1] from Southwest Airlines generated a lot of reactions across the trade and news media to slowing 
MAX deliveries. We want to offer some context. 
Here's the big picture from January 2021. The grounding of the MAX was awful for the airline's fleet planning. 
Moreover, Southwest is focused on one aircraft type - the Boeing[2] 737. This is not unique; Ryanair is the same 
way, for example. But this choice puts the airline at risk when the OEM goes wobbly. And the MAX has seen a few 
of those. In 2023 (through today), Southwest has been getting a new MAX delivery, on average, every three days. 
That is an incredible pace and reflects how badly the airline needs these new aircraft. 
Using data from ch-Aviation, here is Southwest's current fleet. The aircraft to be delivered is 43% of the current 
fleet. Another data point to note: Over half the active fleet is the -700. This 140-seater is the core of Southwest's 
business, and that is what they need to replace. 
Among active aircraft, the -700s average 18.1 years old. This compares to 7.7 for -800s and 2.2 for the MAX. 
Besides the newer aircraft delivering better economics, they are much more fuel efficient. Older 737s have run into 
challenges with fuselage cracks[3]. It has been a while since this news has been repeated. But there was news in 
November last year cracking[4] again. We are aware that internally there is concern about the MAX7 certification 
process because the airline does not want to spend money on fixing their -700s which they cannot recoup before 
MAX7 deliveries. Many of the MAX8s being delivered should be MAX7s. 
Instead of the 100 new MAXs Southwest expected in 2023, they now expect to receive 70. This sounds rough - but 
that is still a new MAX every five days! Which is still an incredible rate. Even at a rate of 100 deliveries this year, the 
aging -700s problem would not be solved. 
So who's at fault here? Boeing owns some of this, for sure. But they don't own all of it. Southwest doubled down on 
the 737 when they could have de-risked their business[5].

The Latvian national airline airBaltic has announced that its top destinations from Finland in March were Munich, 
Copenhagen and Riga.
These destinations are becoming popular among both leisure and business travelers due to airline focus offering 
passengers a wide variety of travel options and flexible timetables. Apart from these destinations, airBaltic flights to 
Malaga, Berlin and Vienna are also ranked among the most favored routes from Finland in March.
"Finnair may have ceased its flights from Tampere, but with airBaltic and Ryanair flights we are more international 
than ever earlier. With airBaltic and their partner airlines, it's possible to reach the whole world faster and smoother 
than ever with one flight change only", says Marja Aalto, aviation senior specialist at Business Tampere.
AirBaltic base at Tampere is company's first base outside Baltic countries and fourth base for total. During March 
2023 airBaltic carried around 25 857 passengers or by 608 % more than during the same period last year in 
Finland.
New destinations from Tampere to Milan and Nice
Starting from May, airBaltic will open two new destinations for summer from Tampere. Flights to Milan and Nice will 
operate twice weekly from the beginning of May 2023. Other destinations operated directly from Tampere are 
Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Malaga, Munich, Rodos and Riga.
Ryanair operates London Stansted twice weekly.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin International) has suspended its flights to Comiso, Sicily, over a spat with airport operator 
Società Aeroporto Catania (SAC), which also manages Catania, the airline confirmed to ch-aviation.
In a statement, the Irish budget carrier said it had called a news conference last week to announce a strengthening 
of its presence in Sicily but claimed SAC had tried to change the terms of its agreement with the airline at the last 
minute.
"Ryanair is committed to grow at all Sicilian Airports. We are the largest carrier in Sicily with over 10 million 
passengers connecting 50 domestic and 56 international routes. We planned to hold press conferences in Sicily on 
April 20 and 21 to announce growth at all four airports but unfortunately, SAC, the owner of Comiso attempted to 
change the terms of our agreement on the eve of the press conference. As a result, Ryanair was sadly forced to 
cancel our announcement in Comiso and all routes have been withdrawn. This is devastating news for Comiso and 
the Ragusa region. Ryanair will gladly restore all of our domestic and international routes to/from Comiso with 
immediate effect if SAC honours the agreement they negotiated and accepted in writing," the airline stated.
SAC was not immediately available for comment.
Competitors were quick to respond. "AeroItalia (XZ, Rome Fiumicino) will take over from Ryanair from May 15 for 
air connections to and from Comiso airport," the regional president of Sicily, Renato Schifani, told Giornale di Sicilia. 
It will offer flights to Comiso from Milan Bergamo, Rome Fiumicino and Forli.
In a joint statement, SAC's president, Giovanna Candura, and managing director Nico Torrisi thanked AeroItalia for 
stepping in so quickly and for guaranteeing "Ragusa airport's connections with Rome, Bergamo, and Forlì after the 
cancellation of the flights operated by Ryanair". "For some time, SAC, together with AeroItalia and other carriers, 
has been working to guarantee a greater and better offer from and to the airport of Comiso, and the prompt 
activation of the regional government to support these initiatives also demonstrates once again the closeness of 
President Schifani to the airport sector of eastern Sicily. The important connections which, from May 15, will be 
reactivated from Comiso will guarantee the mobility of a large slice of Sicilians and, in particular, the tourist flows 
that we expect in large numbers in the coming months."
Meanwhile, on its Italian website, Wizz Air (W6, Budapest) offered affected customers rescue fares. "The skies are 
more pink than blue! Rescue flights to the passengers affected by the Ryanair cancellations," it announced.

Hungarian constitutional court rejects Ryanair tax appeal
Hungarian constitutional court rejects Ryanair tax appeal

Ryanair (FR, Dublin International) has said it regrets a ruling at the Constitutional Court of Hungary that refused to 
accept the carrier's constitutional challenge against the Hungarian government's "failed and illogical 'excess profits' 
tax" on airlines in Hungary, which was later changed into "an equally ridiculous fake 'eco tax'", it outlined in a 
statement on April 21.
The constitutional court, whose task is to make judicial reviews of the acts of the parliament in Budapest, rejected 
on the same day a complaint Ryanair had filed against the introduction of the profit tax last summer, declaring that it 
does not have the authority to rule on the matter. Ryanair received a consumer protection fine of HUF300 million 
forints (USD877,000) for passing the tax on to consumers. Later in the year, the flat tax rate was converted into one 
that is based on carbon emissions, of up to EUR32 (USD35.20) per passenger.
Since taking power in 2010, the nationalist government of the political party Fidesz has narrowed the authority of 
the constitutional court to prevent it from ruling on laws affecting the budget, as long as the national debt does not 
exceed 50% of GDP.
"This flagrant attempt to dress up their money grab as an 'eco tax' [is] just an excessive tax on tourism, visitors, and 
Hungarian families," Ryanair protested in its statement.
"Point-to-point airlines like Ryanair already pay millions of euros every year under the EU Emissions Trading 
Scheme, which covers emissions on flights to/from Hungary. The Hungarian govt's greenwashing is just a double 
taxation at a time when low-cost air access to/from Hungary is essential for the competitiveness of the Hungarian 
economy, which is suffering record inflation," it added.
"During a cost-of-living crisis in Hungary, these unjustified taxes do nothing but further squeeze Hungarian 
citizens/visitors and damage the Hungarian economy which is dependent on low-fare air access and tourism. 
Ryanair already cancelled eight routes and reduced frequencies on a further seven routes from Budapest for Winter 
'22 in direct response" to the tax."

This week's Update features a variety of stories, including updates on Ryanair's attempts to stop platforms' scraping 
of fares and other content from its website. We will continue to keep monitor Ryanair's claims against Booking.com 
in the weeks ahead. Enjoy.
 European Commission Resumes Review of Booking Holdings' Proposed Purchase of ETraveli. It's been some time 
since our last story  on Booking's planned purchase of online flight booking platform, ETraveli. The Commission 
suspended its review of the purchase approximately four months ago, but announced this past week that it was 
resuming its work. The Commission has until August 30 to complete the review.
 Fintech, Tips, Support Service Fees and More: Hopper Has It All. Much has been written in the industry (including 
our own Update) about Hopper. Hopper was one of the first platforms to fully leverage 'fintech' tools as part of its 
B2B and B2C offerings. With the renewed attention on resort fees and other mandatory charges, Skift' s recent 
article about 'tips' on Hopper's booking platform caught our attention. Although Hopper's 'tip' is not mandatory, 
users of the platform (assuming they even see the charge) must affirmatively opt-out of payment the flat-fee or 
percentage charge. Hopper takes a similar approach with support service fees, which also require an unsuspecting 
user to opt-out of paying the additional charge. Does the ability to opt-out of these charges allow Hopper to avoid 
current efforts to reign in so-called 'junk fees,' possibly, depending on the conspicuousness of the fees and their 
disclosures. If the tips are simply a mechanism for offsetting operating costs (as opposed to actual 'tips' paid to 
individuals who assist in making the booking), however, Hopper could garner the attention of regulators or an 
enterprising class action firm.
 Expedia Launches Platform to Make Entertainment Tourism Bookable. Expedia Media Solutions announced last 
week the launch of a new media platform that allows users to shop and book travel while watching travel content. If 
successful, the platform will allow Expedia to capitalize on the growing influence of television and movies (think 
'White Lotus') on travelers' decisions. Brand USA has partnered with Expedia in the launch of this latest new

offering by working together to create a dedicated channel (GoUSA) that features inspirational travel content and 
interactive maps, while at the same time allowing viewers the opportunity to book featured destination (hotels, air 
and experiences) in real time. The channel is now live in Canada and will be rolled out to other international 
markets over the course of the year.

Booking, Etraveli investigation restarts in EU
 April 20, 2023 via MLex 
 Booking's bid to take over online flight travel agency Etraveli is back on the EU regulator's clock after four months 
of suspension. The European Commission resumed its review on April 18, according to an update to its website 
today, and it now has until Aug. 30 to decide on the deal.
Why Hopper Asks for a 'Tip' When Booking
 April 19, 2023 via Skift Travel News 
 Skift Take 'Deception' may be too strong of a word in this case, but the media attention goes to show that 
customers do not like to feel that they've been swindled. A quarter of customers pay the tip, but how many of them 
know it?
Expedia Group launches shoppable streaming platform
 April 19, 2023 via hotelbusiness.com 
 Expedia Group Media Solutions, Expedia Group's global travel advertising platform, has unveiled a new media 
platform, the first advertising and travel technology platform of its kind that gives travelers the tools to shop and

After three years of shocks, including the coronavirus pandemic and soaring fuel prices after Russia's full-scale 
invasion of Ukraine, airline bosses are facing a more welcome puzzle: why is demand booming even as concerns 
mount over a deepening economic downturn?UK airline EASYJET on Tuesday be- came the latest carrier to predict 
a strong summer as it raised its earnings forecasts for a second time this year, boasting not only strong sales but 
also a willingness among passengers to pay high prices.
European rivals have reported similar trends and many are already back in profit despite rising inflation and 
economic headwinds.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, has predicted that an expected rise in airfares of up to 15 per cent this 
summer will have no impact on bookings. Industry executives put the resilience in demand down to people's desire 
to return to normality and resume travelling following pandemic restrictions.
Johan Lundgren, chief executive of EASYJET, said it had become increasingly clear this year that consumers were 
"prioritising" travel after border restrictions and Covid testing rules hampered tourism between 2020 and 2022.
European airlines enjoy a break from gloom Summer is looking rosy as customers prioritise travel after 
lockdowns but the risk of shocks means investors are wary
"We see strong momentum for bookings, which is being driven by customers continuing to prioritise spending on 
their holidays," he said. "Consumer research has said for some time that travel has risen in importance for 
consumer spending and this is clearly coming through in our bookings."
He pointed to recent research from the European Travel Commission, an industry association, which found that 
travel was the only discretionary expense people were willing to maintain despite the economic conditions.
A KPMG survey of UK consumers in December came to a similar conclusion, with travel taking top spot for non-
essential spending in the next 12 months.
Ambrose Faulks, co-manager of Artemis UK Select fund at Artemis Investment Management, which holds shares in 
EASYJET, International Airlines Group and Ryanair, put the industry's resilience down to "pent-up demand, coupled 
with large excess savings post- Covid, coupled with a long absence of visiting friends and relatives, and business 
demand".
Lundgren said recent price rises should also be taken into context. He said the 31 per cent rise in ticket prices in 
EASYJET's most recent quarter averaged about £12, equivalent to the cost of a couple of coffees and a snack at 
an airport. "It is, in absolute numbers, not that massive compared to some of the other cost increases in society," he 
said.
Price rises in the summer, when tickets are typically much more expensive, will be more material for consumers, 
with the average EASYJET fare standing at £90 for a one-way ticket.
"Despite cash crunches elsewhere, while we have full employment and job security, people are willing to dip into 
savings and give themselves a holiday," said Greg Johnson, a travel and leisure analyst at Shore Capital. "The 
question going into next year is, can the level of demand be sustained at current price levels?"
With no signs consumers have been put off, the sector's recovery prompted Ben Smith, chief executive of Air 
France-KLM, to say this year the airline had "turn[ed] the page" on Covid.
Despite the robust demand, companies are finding it more of a challenge to convince investors to back their 
recovery. Shares in many of Europe's big carriers are still well below pre-pandemic levels, despite a recent 
rebound.
Even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Warren Buffett described airlines as a "death trap for investors", with 
companies' fortunes normally closely tied to the global economic cycle and exposed to external shocks, from 
natural disasters to swings in the oil price. The US investor sold his airline holdings in May 2020, saying that "the 
world has changed" for the industry after Covid.
Industry executives admit that companies have more to do to convince skittish investors to return, particularly after 
last summer's rebound was marred by travel disruption.
Analysts and investors said concerns hanging over the sector included whether the industry could remain immune 
to the economic backdrop forever, as well as the future path of oil prices and rising environmental concerns, 
including carbon taxes.
"Recent share moves are telling you there is reasonable confidence summer trading will be healthy," said Andrew 
Lobbenberg, analyst at Barclays.
"But, looking beyond that, investors are certainly anxious about macroeconomic developments ... and are unsure 
about the pace of the business travel recovery."
The sector also emerged from the pandemic with a material debt burden, opening a debate about whether airlines 
will be forced to turn to investors to stump up more capital.
European airlines enjoy a break from gloom Summer is looking rosy as customers prioritise travel after 
lockdowns but the risk of shocks means investors are wary
Nevertheless, European airline executives and fund managers who have backed the industry say its leading 
performers have emerged stronger. Companies now have lower costs after cutbacks, leaving them ready to cash in 
on resurgent demand and the crucial summer season with less competition after weaker airlines retrenched or 
collapsed, they say. Supply chain constraints, including aircraft shortages, also mean it is harder for new entrants to 
shake up the market, or for incumbents to rush in a new supply of seats leading to a collapse in prices.
Chris Davies, an investment manager at Baillie Gifford, the third-largest investor in Ryanair, held shares even 
during the bleakest days of the pandemic in the belief the airline would prosper. "For us, holding Ryanair through 
the pandemic was very much about them just being able to take a lot more market share because they were going 
to survive, others were going to struggle and come out the other end in much worse shape," he said.
Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, is now leading the industry recovery but its shares are 10 per cent below 
prepandemic levels, despite the market share gains it is targeting.
"We still think that there's quite a big mismatch here between the opportunity in front of them, their ability to exploit it 
and where the market is today," Davies said.
Ryanair's O'Leary said he expected European airlines to be "re-rated" later this year following a "dramatic 
reassessment" of the sector by investors.
But his optimism came with a warning that underscored the sector's vulnerability to external shocks and has put off 
some investors. "I would hope we are in for two or three years of reasonably stable capacity, reasonably stable 
pricing," he said. "But then fuel could mess it up. Or an Icelandic volcano - or war and pestilence somewhere."

After three years of shocks, including the coronavirus pandemic and soaring fuel prices after Russia's full-scale 
invasion of Ukraine, airline bosses are facing a more welcome puzzle: why is demand booming even as concerns 
mount over a deepening economic downturn?UK airline EASYJET on Tuesday be- came the latest carrier to predict 
a strong summer as it raised its earnings forecasts for a second time this year, boasting not only strong sales but 
also a willingness among passengers to pay high prices.
European rivals have reported similar trends and many are already back in profit despite rising inflation and 
economic headwinds.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, has predicted that an expected rise in airfares of up to 15 per cent this 
summer will have no impact on bookings. Industry executives put the resilience in demand down to people's desire 
to return to normality and resume travelling following pandemic restrictions.
Johan Lundgren, chief executive of EASYJET, said it had become increasingly clear this year that consumers were 
"prioritising" travel after border restrictions and Covid testing rules hampered tourism between 2020 and 2022.
European airlines enjoy a break from gloom Summer is looking rosy as customers prioritise travel after 
lockdowns but the risk of shocks means investors are wary
"We see strong momentum for bookings, which is being driven by customers continuing to prioritise spending on 
their holidays," he said. "Consumer research has said for some time that travel has risen in importance for 
consumer spending and this is clearly coming through in our bookings."
He pointed to recent research from the European Travel Commission, an industry association, which found that 
travel was the only discretionary expense people were willing to maintain despite the economic conditions.
A KPMG survey of UK consumers in December came to a similar conclusion, with travel taking top spot for non-
essential spending in the next 12 months.
Ambrose Faulks, co-manager of Artemis UK Select fund at Artemis Investment Management, which holds shares in 
EASYJET, International Airlines Group and Ryanair, put the industry's resilience down to "pent-up demand, coupled 
with large excess savings post- Covid, coupled with a long absence of visiting friends and relatives, and business 
demand".
Lundgren said recent price rises should also be taken into context. He said the 31 per cent rise in ticket prices in 
EASYJET's most recent quarter averaged about £12, equivalent to the cost of a couple of coffees and a snack at 
an airport. "It is, in absolute numbers, not that massive compared to some of the other cost increases in society," he 
said.
Price rises in the summer, when tickets are typically much more expensive, will be more material for consumers, 
with the average EASYJET fare standing at £90 for a one-way ticket.
"Despite cash crunches elsewhere, while we have full employment and job security, people are willing to dip into 
savings and give themselves a holiday," said Greg Johnson, a travel and leisure analyst at Shore Capital. "The 
question going into next year is, can the level of demand be sustained at current price levels?"
With no signs consumers have been put off, the sector's recovery prompted Ben Smith, chief executive of Air 
France-KLM, to say this year the airline had "turn[ed] the page" on Covid.
Despite the robust demand, companies are finding it more of a challenge to convince investors to back their 
recovery. Shares in many of Europe's big carriers are still well below pre-pandemic levels, despite a recent 
rebound.
Even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Warren Buffett described airlines as a "death trap for investors", with 
companies' fortunes normally closely tied to the global economic cycle and exposed to external shocks, from 
natural disasters to swings in the oil price. The US investor sold his airline holdings in May 2020, saying that "the 
world has changed" for the industry after Covid.
Industry executives admit that companies have more to do to convince skittish investors to return, particularly after 
last summer's rebound was marred by travel disruption.
Analysts and investors said concerns hanging over the sector included whether the industry could remain immune 
to the economic backdrop forever, as well as the future path of oil prices and rising environmental concerns, 
including carbon taxes.
"Recent share moves are telling you there is reasonable confidence summer trading will be healthy," said Andrew 
Lobbenberg, analyst at Barclays.
"But, looking beyond that, investors are certainly anxious about macroeconomic developments ... and are unsure 
about the pace of the business travel recovery."
The sector also emerged from the pandemic with a material debt burden, opening a debate about whether airlines 
will be forced to turn to investors to stump up more capital.
European airlines enjoy a break from gloom Summer is looking rosy as customers prioritise travel after 
lockdowns but the risk of shocks means investors are wary
Nevertheless, European airline executives and fund managers who have backed the industry say its leading 
performers have emerged stronger. Companies now have lower costs after cutbacks, leaving them ready to cash in 
on resurgent demand and the crucial summer season with less competition after weaker airlines retrenched or 
collapsed, they say. Supply chain constraints, including aircraft shortages, also mean it is harder for new entrants to 
shake up the market, or for incumbents to rush in a new supply of seats leading to a collapse in prices.
Chris Davies, an investment manager at Baillie Gifford, the third-largest investor in Ryanair, held shares even 
during the bleakest days of the pandemic in the belief the airline would prosper. "For us, holding Ryanair through 
the pandemic was very much about them just being able to take a lot more market share because they were going 
to survive, others were going to struggle and come out the other end in much worse shape," he said.
Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, is now leading the industry recovery but its shares are 10 per cent below 
prepandemic levels, despite the market share gains it is targeting.
"We still think that there's quite a big mismatch here between the opportunity in front of them, their ability to exploit it 
and where the market is today," Davies said.
Ryanair's O'Leary said he expected European airlines to be "re-rated" later this year following a "dramatic 
reassessment" of the sector by investors.
But his optimism came with a warning that underscored the sector's vulnerability to external shocks and has put off 
some investors. "I would hope we are in for two or three years of reasonably stable capacity, reasonably stable 
pricing," he said. "But then fuel could mess it up. Or an Icelandic volcano - or war and pestilence somewhere."

easyJet , Jet2 updates hint good times returning for airlines
easyJet, Jet2 updates hint good times returning for airlines

Jet2 PLC (AIM:JET2) became the latest to shower the aviation industry with optimism when it lifted profit guidance 
for the second month in a row on Thursday.
Following easyJet PLC's solid results last week, Jet2 noted it would likely outdo previous guidance and score a pre-
tax profit in the region of £387mln to £392mln for 2022.
Both airlines scored a host of buy ratings following the updates, with easyJet anticipating a return to pre-pandemic 
passenger figures this summer and Jet2 on course to do the same.
"By the summer the Covid nightmare looks set to be little more than a bad dream," Hargreaves Lansdown analyst 
Susannah Streeter commented.
EasyJet is "facing little turbulence from cost-of-living headwinds," she added, with Jet2 also agreeing people were 
"eager" for holidays after being denied during the pandemic.
RBC Brewin Dolphin manager John Moore hailed that easyJet's update proved the FTSE 250-listed low-cost carrier 
was "beginning to turn a corner," meanwhile.
Though London-listed Jet2 avoided delving too deep into guidance for the coming year given 40% of its summer 
tickets remain on sale, a 7.2% rise in capacity to 15.26mln seats for the period proved its optimistic stance.
If sold, Jet2 would pen a rise on 2019 passenger figures, which sat at 14.3mln in the final full year before the 
pandemic grounded flights en masse, prompting Barclay's to issue an 'overweight' rating.
easyJet , Jet2 updates hint good times returning for airlines
Liberum analysts pointed to Jet2's "positive outlook" following the update, hinting trading should be strong this 
summer, alongside easyJet, Ryanair and British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group SA 
(LSE:IAG) (IAG), which were all tipped with 'buy' ratings from the bank.
IAG will update on its first-quarter earnings on May 5, followed by Ryanair's full-year results on May 22, providing 
further insight into their respective post-Covid recoveries.
Ryanair has already consistently carried more passengers in the past year than in 2019, reporting traffic of 12.6mln 
people most recently in March, with a load factor of 93%.
Citi analysts predict this bounce-back to spread to short-haul flights across the board in the UK and Europe towards 
the end of this year.
However, the bank warned longer journeys, flown by the likes of British Airways, would not yet catch up, in a note 
earlier this week.
"Recovering business traffic," cited by Citi, will likely mark good news for British Airways, given it is "highly 
dependent" on corporate travel, though whether it makes up the 30% shortfall on 2019 passenger figures penned 
last year remains to be seen.
One elephant in the room for the sector may also be the looming threat of strikes in Europe.
Security staff striking at Heathrow and air traffic controllers in France helped to push cancellations above 33,300 
flights between April 5 and 11, up from 7,800 during last year's East period, according to Airhelp data.
Since neither dispute looks set to be resolved, with the former group set to strike again for ten days in May, the 
effects of industrial action on aviation and its return to pre-pandemic trading seems yet to fully emerge.

Ryanair says Swiss OTA ruling has "no practical impact"
Ryanair says Swiss OTA ruling has "no practical impact"

Ryanair (FR, Dublin International) has dismissed a recent decision by the Swiss Supreme Court to allow online 
travel agency (OTA) lastminute.com to sell Ryanair tickets on its OTA platforms. Ryanair says last week's Swiss 
decision will have "no practical impact" as European Union (EU) law entitles airlines to determine their own 
distribution models and to protect their websites by contractual terms of use.
As recently reported by ch-aviation, lastminute.com subsidiary BravoNext SA won a 15 year legal battle against the 
Irish low-cost carrier who was trying to stop the OTA reselling its flight tickets. The court said the lastminute.com 
business did not infringe any intellectual property rights or any contractual obligations towards Ryanair and could 
continue selling Ryanair tickets. Other lastminute OTA subsidiaries, including volagratis.com, rumbo.es, weg.de, 
and bravofy.com were also covered in the ruling. For its troubles, Ryanair was also ordered to pay court costs of 
approximately CHF49,000 Swiss francs (USD54,000 dollars).
In an April 18 statement, Ryanair highlighted the EU law and added that the Irish Supreme Court has ruled that the 
terms of use of the Ryanair website are governed by Irish law. "Accordingly, Ryanair confirms it will retain its direct 
to customers distribution model," the statement said. "Notwithstanding the wealth of jurisprudence confirming a 
business' right to determine its own distribution model, lastminute insists on reselling Ryanair's flights without 
having any commercial agreement to do so." Ryanair referred a 2022 Paris Court of Appeal decision that required 
lastminute.com and its subsidiaries stop selling Ryanair tickets and ordered lastminute.com to pay damages for 
"free-riding" on Ryanair's website.
Ryanair sells tickets to customers via its own distribution platform and has initiated legal campaigns against 
unauthorised resellers who scrape data from Ryanair's website and on-sell flights tickets, frequently with a small 
markup. "Where a booking appears to have been made through a third-party travel agent who has no commercial 
relationship with Ryanair, the booking may be blocked," says Ryanair's website." Ryanair also says OTAs 
frequently do not provide the airline with a passenger's contact or payment details, all of which need to be resolved 
before a passenger flies for safety and security purposes.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin International) has dismissed a recent decision by the Swiss Supreme Court to allow online 
travel agency (OTA) lastminute.com to sell Ryanair tickets on its OTA platforms. Ryanair says last week's Swiss 
decision will have "no practical impact" as European Union (EU) law entitles airlines to determine their own 
distribution models and to protect their websites by contractual terms of use.
As recently reported by ch-aviation, lastminute.com subsidiary BravoNext SA won a 15 year legal battle against the 
Irish low-cost carrier who was trying to stop the OTA reselling its flight tickets. The court said the lastminute.com 
business did not infringe any intellectual property rights or any contractual obligations towards Ryanair and could 
continue selling Ryanair tickets. Other lastminute OTA subsidiaries, including volagratis.com, rumbo.es, weg.de, 
and bravofy.com were also covered in the ruling. For its troubles, Ryanair was also ordered to pay court costs of 
approximately CHF49,000 Swiss francs (USD54,000 dollars).
In an April 18 statement, Ryanair highlighted the EU law and added that the Irish Supreme Court has ruled that the 
terms of use of the Ryanair website are governed by Irish law. "Accordingly, Ryanair confirms it will retain its direct 
to customers distribution model," the statement said. "Notwithstanding the wealth of jurisprudence confirming a 
business' right to determine its own distribution model, lastminute insists on reselling Ryanair's flights without 
having any commercial agreement to do so." Ryanair referred a 2022 Paris Court of Appeal decision that required 
lastminute.com and its subsidiaries stop selling Ryanair tickets and ordered lastminute.com to pay damages for 
"free-riding" on Ryanair's website.
Ryanair sells tickets to customers via its own distribution platform and has initiated legal campaigns against 
unauthorised resellers who scrape data from Ryanair's website and on-sell flights tickets, frequently with a small 
markup. "Where a booking appears to have been made through a third-party travel agent who has no commercial 
relationship with Ryanair, the booking may be blocked," says Ryanair's website." Ryanair also says OTAs 
frequently do not provide the airline with a passenger's contact or payment details, all of which need to be resolved 
before a passenger flies for safety and security purposes.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin International) will trim its July 2023 schedule as the deliveries of its B737-8-200s will be 
affected by the recent manufacturing issues at key supplier Spirit AeroSystems, Ryanair Holdings Chief Executive 
Michael O'Leary told Reuters.
"We are beginning to look at schedules maybe being about 10 [B737 MAX] short for July. We'll get maybe 12 by the 
end of June, and then we hope 12 by the end of July," he said.
The low-cost carrier initially hoped to take twenty-two B737-8-200s by the end of June and just two in July. Ryanair 
has historically tried to avoid taking many deliveries during the peak summer season to avoid the additional 
complexity associated with aircraft induction at a time when the airline is operating its most intense schedule.
O'Leary stressed that the LCC would focus on reducing the number of departures on high-frequency routes rather 
than suspending routes altogether if forced to trim its network.
Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems, a Kansas-based supplier which builds around 70% of each B737 including the 
fuselage, recently discovered a "non-standard manufacturing issue" affecting the assembly of vertical stabilisers for 
all B737 MAX variants except the B737-9. The manufacturer has yet to provide a specific assessment regarding the 
impact of the snag, which has been deemed not an "immediate safety of flight issue". However, Boeing has already 
stated that the rework of all yet-to-be-delivered B737 MAX would delay a "substantial number" of their deliveries.
Ryanair currently operates 100 B737-8-200s, split between its Irish AOC, Buzz (Poland), and Malta Air. It has a 
further 110 on firm order from Boeing. It remains the world's only operator of the variant and is also Boeing's largest 
customer for the -8-200, the ch-aviation fleets advanced module shows.

The budget airline Wizz Air is testing a first-of-its-kind subscription plan in the form of the new WIZZ Multi-Pass.
The airline is launching the subscription model in Europe for passengers on domestic routes in Italy and 
international routes to and from Poland, as part of its initial trial run.
The six-month subscription pass, which must be paid for in six fixed monthly payments, allows travelers to take 
either a one-way or return trip each month, the airline said in a press release. The new program is slated to kick off 
in May.
As part of the program, subscribers will be able to select from four different plan options. They include: ticket only; 
ticket and WIZZ priority; ticket and a 20 kg checked bag, or the most substantial package, which includes all of the 
elements already mentioned.
Those who purchase a subscription can book a flight right away when the subscription starts and take their first 
flight within five days. Subscriptions will start on the first day of the month and customers will be able to take flights 
starting on the sixth day of the month. Subscriptions will renew on the first day of every subsequent month for the 
duration of the six months.
"With WIZZ Multi-Pass, travelers get a fixed price for flights and additional products for the subscription period, a 
great opportunity ahead of a high summer season," the airline said in a statement. "At the same time, there is no 
need to monitor prices and plan way in advance to secure cheaper flights; instead, it becomes very easy to hop on 
a flight to go to an important business meeting or a spontaneous city break."
Those who hold a subscription pass will also be able to purchase additional add-on services when booking a flight, 
similar to passengers booking a regular ticket.
Wizz is one of many Europe-based budget airlines. Others include Ryanair, EasyJet, and Vueling.

London Luton Airport (LLA) within around 30 minutes for around £10.
Body
The non-stop rail service is operated by East Midlands Railway and runs from London St Pancras to Luton Airport 
Parkway where the brand-new Luton DART shuttle departs to the terminal, connecting passengers to the terminal 
in less than four minutes. Simon Pready, commercial director of East Midlands Railway, said: "EMR's Luton Airport 
Express will provide customers travelling from the capital and the south, a convenient, fast and environmentally 
friendly way to get to the airport - with a trip taking as little as 32 minutes and costing from as little as £10 - it's a 
great option. 
"Along with the introduction of DART, the Luton Airport Express represents the beginning of an exciting new 
chapter for the town and we are proud to be part of such an environmentally and economically important project." 
There is a Luton Airport Express train departing every 30 minutes from early morning to late at night Monday to 
Saturday, and there is also a regular service on Sundays while the Luton DART runs 24 hours a day every day.

RYANAIR boss Michael O'Leary (pictured) took aim at British politicians yesterday, accusing them of over-egging 
the benefits of Brexit and describing the aviation minister as "not the brightest sandwich in the picnic".
O'Leary's chief frustration is labour inflexibility which he says is stopping airlines staffing up quickly - an issue he 
says the government is not taking seriously.
"We have had a number of meetings with the Department of Transport, and the Aviation Minister Baroness Vere, 
who is not the brightest sandwich in the picnic basket. She has had a distinguished career running girls schools, but 
aviation is not her forte," he said at a conference in Dublin yesterday.
Despite this, the aviation boss remained optimistic about the industry which is "still growing in the UK", stating his 
surprise "at the strength of spending in the UK".
"For all the talk of fuel poverty and consumer price inflation, people are spending on travel."
Demand for travel has defied the economic downturn, with Ryanair rival Easyjet yesterday predicting a bumper 
summer of bookings.

EASYJET yesterday announced a £120m improvement in its first half performance year on year, as the lowcost 
airline continued to turn around its business.
Headline losses before tax for the first half are expected to land in between £405m and £425m, in spite of economic 
challenges including inflation and rising fuel costs. Most airlines make most of their profits in the summer.
The airline reported an especially strong Easter, with 1,600 flights operating each day and capacity around pre-
pandemic levels. Easyjet said 99.8 per cent of planned flights jetted off despite disruption from French strikes over 
pension reforms.
It continued to increase its capacity throughout the quarter, growing 40 per cent from January to March, and is 
expecting to hit prepandemic capacity by summer.
Easyjet boss Johan Lundgren said: "Demand for our flights and holidays has continued to grow, resulting in more 
than a £120m pound improvement in our performance as well as a billion pound revenue improvement year on 
year."
As a result, Easyjet expects to outperform market expectations of pre-tax profits of £260m for FY23, he said.
John Moore, senior investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, put the airline's success down to it "taking more of 
a 'Ryanair approach' to routes [and] baggage allowances", which helped protect margins.
"There are real signs the airline is beginning to turn a corner" he added.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) plans to reduce its July flights due to an anticipated delay in the delivery of about 10 737 MAX

The Irish budget airline's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said it expects to receive 12 planes in June and another 
12 by the end of July, compared with the original delivery schedule of 22 in June and two in July, Reuters reported 
Wednesday.
O'Leary said Boeing is expected to provide an updated delivery schedule by Friday.
Ryanair was down marginally on early Wednesday afternoon.

 Is the road trip making a comeback? Some of you will say it never went away. On an emotional and aspirational 
level you'd be right, but on a practical level I think we all know that the advent of cheap short-haul flights lured us 
away from our cars as the promise of quick, convenient, affordable forays into Europe became a reality. Even the 
pain of Ryanair was worth it if you could get to Milan for 20. 
Flying has never been the same since 9/11, but thanks to Covid and spiralling fuel costs, air travel is now a hateful 
process from beginning to end. Expensive tickets, understaffed airports, ridiculous three-hour check-in times, the 
joy of sitting in close proximity to several hundred mouth-breathing passengers or the spectre of cancelled flights 
are traumas we can all do without. 
This was highlighted to me when planning a short four-night stay in Switzerland to visit my in-laws. In the past, 
MrsM and I would have booked EasyJet flights to Geneva and then jumped on the train for a two-hour journey to 
Sion (the closest city to our final destination in the mountains). This time I decided to compare the cost and journey 
time of making the same trip by car. 
 > 'I can envisage a time where the best drivers are squabbling over the worst cars'[1] 
Okay, so there was an ulterior motive - I really wanted to complete a long drive in my long-term-test F-type[2] before 
it goes back to Jaguar[3]. But whereas in the past it would have been hard to justify the extra time and expense of 
driving, this time around not only was it marginally cheaper (even allowing for a Flexiplus tunnel ticket to try and 
avoid potential delays), but the call of the road felt infinitely more appealing. 
What is it about a road trip that's so pleasing? Normally I hate packing to go away, but when you're heading off in 
the car it's part of the enjoyment. Especially if you're in a car with limited luggage space. Likewise making sure the 
car is fuelled, fresh and clean inside and out the night before you leave. It's the same with an early start. Setting 
your alarm for ohmigawd o'clock is something to resent if all it does is give you a fighting chance of checking in with 
more than 30 seconds to spare, but when you're hitting the road to make good early progress at the start of a full 
day's driving I'm almost glad to hear the alarm go off. 
The 700-mile run to and from Switzerland was perfect. Almost exactly 12 hours door-to-door, including time spent 
waiting for and riding on the Eurotunnel and with two brief stops each way to fill up with fuel and grab a handful of 
road snacks. Our round-trip stats were pretty remarkable, a total of 1537 miles covered at an average speed of 
73mph and 32.2mpg. Not bad for a supercharged 5-litre 450bhp V8. 
'Driving connects you to your journey. Flying feels like an awkward stasis to be endured'
It was as effortless and enjoyable as we could have wished. I always take a few hours to really settle into a long 
drive, the kilometres dragging until something clicks and the cadence of your internal trip meter shifts from 
measuring everything in blocks of five or ten miles to 50 or even 100 miles. Having been largely confined to the UK 
for years, seeing signs pointing to destinations in France, Switzerland and Italy seemed impossibly exotic, to the 
point where it was tempting to just keep going as tendrils of wanderlust began to take hold. 
Just as it's rewarding to make such imperious progress, so there's something enormously satisfying about seeing 
the scenery slowly morph as the miles pile on. As the autoroute began to cling to the mountains and Lake Geneva 
shimmered below us, there was no way I would have traded my place for a seat on any plane. Feeling your mind 
dial out the white noise that pollutes our daily lives is deeply therapeutic and offers further proof - if any were 
needed - that driving connects you to your journey while flying feels like an awkward stasis to be endured rather 
than enjoyed. 
Given my profession, I feel embarrassed and slightly ashamed of all those times I opted to fly to places instead of 
drive. In hindsight how could it have ever been sustainable to have millions of people using airliners like buses, 
often paying less to fly to Prague than catch the Number 47 into your local town? Bluntly, just because we could 
doesn't mean we should. 
Still I'd be lying if I said some of those quick and dirty flights didn't take me on memorable trips, but the good bits 
unfailingly happened on terra firma while those hours in the air were all instantly forgettable; at best something to 
sleep through. When you drive somewhere, every mile contributes towards the overall experience and a boundless 
sense of freedom. Despite the doom-mongering and anti-car media agenda, when you put a car to good use 
(ideally one powered by an internal combustion engine) there is no better way to travel. All of which reaffirms my 
belief that if a long journey's worth doing, it's worth doing by car.

Apr 19, 2023( Watts Up With That?: http://wattsupwiththat.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 From NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT[1] 
by Paul Homewood 
Would somebody like to tell me when anybody actually voted for any of this? 
Jetting off to the Mediterranean this summer? I hope you got a good deal, because cheap flights are becoming 
increasingly hard to find. 
You probably had an inkling that the era of absurdly cheap short-haul flights in Europe was coming to an end. After 
all, according to travel search engine Kayak, summer flights between the UK and the continent are currently one-
third more expensive than last year. But two new reports make it clear that this isn't just temporary turbulence. 
It's the new reality for flying as airlines face a huge decarbonization challenge and tightening climate-compliance 
laws 
The first headwind stems from two big changes in the European Union's Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). 
Airlines must have enough emissions allowances to cover every metric ton of carbon dioxide released into the 
atmosphere on flights starting and ending in the European Economic Area, the UK and Switzerland. Right now, they 
get about half of those allowances for free. But thatdeal comes to an end in 2026[2], as the share of allowances 
they have to pay for starts to rise from 2024. That is effectively going to double their carbon costs over just three 
years. 
The unit price of carbon emissions has also soared recently, topping €100 ($111) for the first time in late February, 
and it doesn't seem to be on its way back down. A report by Alex Irving, European transport analyst at Bernstein, 
puts the resulting cost from these changes for European airlines at about €5 billion in 2027. 
That's just the thin end of the wedge. Over the next three decades, aviation has to transform itself from a polluting 
industry — planes are responsible for 2.5% of global CO2 emissions — to a net-zero one. Under Destination 2050, 
the European sector's plan to reduce emissions, it'll do that by investing in future aircraft and infrastructure, making 
operations more efficient, and using alternative fuels and carbon-removal technologies. 
Areport[3]by research groups SEO Amsterdam Economics and the Royal Netherlands Aerospace Centre, 
commissioned by airline industry bodies, has put the cost of reaching net zero by 2050 at a whopping €820 billion. 
The End of CheapFlights
Both reports conclude the sector won't be able to absorb these costs itself. The changes to the EU ETS alone will 
slash the operating profit of the continent's six largest point-to-point airlines (Ryanair Holdings Plc, EasyJet Plc, 
Wizz Air Holdings Plc, Vueling, Eurowings and Transavia) by an estimated 77%. That means ticket prices will have 
to be higher, which in turn means that demand destruction is inevitable. As Irving writes: 'If it were possible to 
charge more without spoiling demand, airlines would have already been doing so.' 
Demand growth is atouchy subject for airlines[4], as a recent battle over proposed flight caps between the Dutch 
government and Amsterdam's Schiphol airport illustrates. The forecasts are strong: TheInternational Air Transport 
Association suggested that passenger numbers[5]would nearly double to just under 8 billion by 2040 from 2017 
levels. Time will tell if rising ticket prices dampen that, but the question remains whether growth is even compatible 
with ambitions for carbon-neutrality. 
The answer might be hard to swallow. Decarbonizing flying is hard enough without the extra passengers. A briefing 
from the Royal Society, for example, outlined that even meeting existing UK aviation demand with biofuels would 
require about half of the country's agricultural land. 
Fewer flights is, naturally, the easiest way to slice carbon emissions, and so a demand drop would come with its 
own climate benefits. The aviation industry's report calculates that, in 2050, the drop in demand from raising prices 
to pay for sustainable airplane fuel would reduce emissions by 12%, and economic measures — such as 
emissions-trading obligations and CO2 removal investments — would lead to a further2% reduction, compared with 
a business-as-usual scenario.

Ryanair fails in bid to block Booking.com counterclaim
Ryanair fails in bid to block Booking.com counterclaim

A Delaware judge has refused an application by Ryanair (FR, Dublin International) to dismiss a counterclaim 
brought against by online travel agent (OTA) Booking.com, which forms part of a long-running legal dispute 
between the two entities about Booking.com and its subsidiaries selling Ryanair tickets on their OTA platforms.
In an April 7, 2023, judgement, US Circuit Judge William Bryson denied all of Ryanair's applications except one 
regarding Booking.com's allegations of defamation relating to Ryanair's public statements. Booking.com's five-point 
counterclaim has alleged tortious interference with business relationships, unfair competition, defamation, trade 
libel, and deceptive trade practices on the part of Ryanair.
The Booking.com counterclaim is part of a legal stoush that goes back to 2020 and centres on the practice of 
Booking.com scraping flight information and using that information to sell Ryanair tickets on its various OTA 
platforms, including Priceline, Agoda, and Kayak. Ryanair's terms and conditions expressly forbid this practice, and 
it sued parent entity Booking.com in 2020, alleging violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 
1030. Booking.com then brought five state law counterclaims against Ryanair, which the airline has unsuccessfully 
sought to dismiss.
Booking.com's so far successful counterclaim case has relied on statements made by Ryanair in public and to 
Booking.com's customers about OTAs. Booking.com says emails to their customers who purchased Ryanair tickets 
made several statements about OTAs, including that the sites are "unauthorized," that the sites "may apply massive 
mark-ups to fares or ancillary products," that the sites use "screen scraping" software to "mis-sell" Ryanair flights, 
and that the sites provide "false payment and contact details" to Ryanair. Booking.com also says Ryanair made 
social media posts about OTAs and issues regarding refunds for flight tickets and potentially fraudulent behaviour in 
the purchase process.
Much of the legal discussion in the counterclaim case centred on the meaning and motive of Ryanair's emails and 
social media posts. Ryanair's legal representatives argued that the emails and social media posts did not meet the 
required thresholds to substantiate the various counterclaims. In all but one point, Bryson disagreed. Ryanair's 
motion to dismiss Booking.com's counterclaims is denied," he said, "except with respect to Booking.com's 
allegations of defamation relating to Ryanair's public statements."
Ryanair succeeded with that because they argued all the statements referenced in Booking.com's pleadings are 
made about OTAs generally and not specifically to Booking.com. "As the Third Circuit has explained, statements 
Ryanair fails in bid to block Booking.com counterclaim
that disparage a group may not serve as a basis for an individual defamation claim unless a reader could 
reasonably connect them to the complaining individual," reads Bryson's judgement. "Booking.com has not plausibly 
alleged that the public statements made by Ryanair could reasonably be connected to Booking.com."
However, that win for Ryanair only concerns public statements - the social media posts, not the emails to specific 
Booking.com customers, which Bryson says contain references that plausibly refer to Booking.com. "The fact that 
the messages were sent specifically to customers of Booking.com supports the inference that the statements 
referred to Booking.com," the judgement said. Accordingly, Booking.com's defamation claim will not be dismissed 
on the ground that Booking.com has failed to refer to Booking.com in any of its communications with customers."
In a potentially ominous sign concerning Ryanair's broader battle to prevent Booking.com from selling its tickets, 
last week, the Swiss Supreme Court ruled in favour of OTA BravoNext, a lastminute.com subsidiary, after a 15-year 
legal battle. The court decided that the OTA could continue including Ryanair in its fare comparison and purchase 
opportunities across its various platforms, also ordering Ryanair to pay legal costs. CEO of lastminute, Luca 
Concone, says making any flight ticket available on its OTA platforms "fosters transparency and drives growth and 
competition in the market."

Air Malta to be dissolved and new national airline launched in 2023

The Maltese government is planning to shut down Air Malta and establish a new national airline straight away, a 
plan that is set to be complete by the end of 2023.
According to David Curmi, the Executive Chairman of Air Malta, the plan to dissolve Air Malta and open up a new 
Maltese carrier is in its final stages. "We are nearing the end of long, difficult, and complex discussions with the 
European Commission, which did not want a photocopy of Air Malta. We showed the commission that we mean 
business," Curmi stated during an interview with Times of Malta.
Curmi also pointed out that while the transition will be "seamless" for passengers, all 330 of the current employees 
working at Air Malta will have to re-apply to for roles at the new airline.
Several previous reports from outlets in Malta, including the Times of Malta and The Shift, stated that the European 
Commission (EC) would not allow the local government to inject (EURO)290 million ($318.2 million) to save the 
ailing Air Malta. This led the carrier to decide to start again with a new national carrier, with Curmi adding that the 
airline has a "five-year business plan" and was "close to concluding on that".
"The new airline will not be competing on price but on service. This will be our competitive edge," Curmi added.
Malta is also home to Malta Air, a subsidiary of low-cost carrier Ryanair. Irish airline's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) 
Michael O'Leary told The Malta Independent in September 2022 that Air Malta was too small to survive.
In 2010, the Maltese government notified the EC that it wanted to grant a loan of (EURO)52 million ($57 million) to 
ensure the survival of Air Malta, with the commission approving the aid. A year later, in May 2011, the government 
once again asked the EC to give permission to grant the flag carrier a capital injection of (EURO)130 million ($142.6 
million), which the EC eventually approved on June 27, 2012.
This is not the first time that the EC's decision not to grant permission for state aid has resulted in a freshly formed 
airline in the European Union (EU). The Italian government replaced Alitalia with ITA Airways on October 15, 2021, 
the same day that the former flag carrier shut its doors, while the Estonian government replaced Estonian Air with 
Nordica in November 2015.

Ticket prices for flights are expected to rise in the coming yearsas the airline industry wrestles with the costs of 
reaching net zero by 2050.

 European aviation alone is expected to spend 'a whopping €820 billion' to reach net zero, Bloomberg  reported. 
Factors include changes to the European Union's Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), and the need to invest in 
cleaner technologies, all of which will dramatically slash profit margins.
 Until airlines can fully decarbonise, these pressures mean 'waving goodbye to the low prices that made 
globetrotting accessible to millions of people ', said Bloomberg.With summer flights already a third more expensive 
than last year, according to travel search engine Kayak, returning to the pre-pandemic norm of cheap flights is 
increasingly looking like a long shot.
 What pressures do airlines face?
 Looming on the horizon are changes to the terms of the EU ETS. Under this scheme, airlines operating within the 
European Economic Area (EEA), as well as the UKand Switzerland, are required to cover every tonne of carbon 
dioxide emitted with permits.
 The EU provides roughly half of these free of charge, but a law change agreed in December means free permits 
are being phased out. These will be cut by 25% in 2024, then 50% the following year, before being phased out 
entirely by 2026, giving airlines 'a financial incentive for them to pollute less', Reuters  reported at the time.
 But this could effectively 'double their carbon costs over just three years', added Bloomberg. It could also slash the 
operating profits of the six largest point-to-point airlines - including Ryanair, easyJet, Wizz Air, Vueling, 
Eurowingsand Transavia - by 77%.
The end of the era of cheap flights
 Airlines also face added costs of 'moving to cleaner and more expensive fuels' as well as investment in future 
aircraft and infrastructure, said the Financial Times (FT) . Ticket prices will have to rise, said Bloomberg, meaning 
'demand destruction is inevitable'.
 How will airlines cut carbon emissions?
 Sustainable Aviation, an industry alliance comprising airlines, airports and manufacturers, is banking heavily on 
sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced from sources like agricultural waste. They believe this will account for at 
least three-quarters of the fuel used in UK flights by 2050.
 The organisation estimates it can reduce carbon emissions by 70% overtraditional fuel - accounting for a 40% 
overall carbon reduction - but it's 'currently several times more expensive to produce', said BBC News , and these 
are 'costs the group says would have to be passed on'.
 Reducing emissions is a much harder feat than it might seem, too, given passenger numbers are expected to 
nearly double to just shy of 8 billion by 2040 compared with 2017.
 But Sustainable Aviation has factored in a projected reduction in demand caused by rising costs - the 'green 
premium' - into its decarbonisation strategy. Emissions will fall by 12% thanks to this dampened demand, while an 
additional 2% reduction in emissions will be sourced from emissions-trading obligations and carbon dioxide removal 
investments.
 To ease the process, the industry is hoping for more government support, including subsidies, so endeavours like 
SAF production can play a role in slashing carbon emissions quicker than expected. The UK government has, the 
FT said, endorsed subsidising the transition to SAF, in principle, 'without giving details on funding'.
 Will we ever return to the age of cheap flights?
 On prices, the direction of travel as far as the aviation industry is concerned, is clear. For example,Ryanair chief 
Michael O'Leary told the FT  last summer that it was'absurd' when flying to Stansted that 'the train journey to central 
London is more expensive than the air fare'.
 Although cheap flights have been a fixture in the industry for some time, at least until Covid-19 , there's long been 
an industry appetite to permanently shift away from this model. You can't, after all, 'expect an industry making an 
average $1 profit per customer to absorb the [cost] increases we've seen', said Willie Walsh, director general of the 
International Air Transport Association, in December.
 Decarbonising aviation is full of 'unknowns' - such as the host of untested technologies the industry is relying on - 
but what's certain, Bloomberg concluded, is that 'it's going to be a very expensive, challenging few decades'.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) expects "no practical impact" from the Swiss court ruling that confirmed that lastminute.com 
(LMN.SW) is allowed to sell flights of the airline on its website.
The airline said Tuesday the decision does not affect its distribution model, which is protected by European Union 
law. "Notwithstanding the wealth of jurisprudence confirming a business' right to determine its own distribution 
model, Lastminute insists on reselling Ryanair's flights without having any commercial agreement to do so," it 
added. 
The Swiss Supreme Court on April 13 ruled in favor of the Swiss travel company and rejected Ryanair's appeal to 
stop lastminute.com from bookings.

Boeing Shares Tumble As Some MAX Deliveries Halted, Airlines Fret Over Impact
Boeing Shares Tumble As Some MAX Deliveries Halted, Airlines Fret Over 
Impact

Boeing Co shares fell as much as 7% on Friday after the planemaker halted deliveries of some 737 MAX jets due to 
quality-related problems with certain components made by one of its main suppliers.
 Boeing is under tough regulatory scrutiny following the deadly crashes of its MAX planes in 2018 and 2019 and the 
pause in deliveries may delay plans for production ramp-up as it needs to undertake inspections of affected jets, 
some analysts said.
 Any delay in deliveries is likely to upset airlines that have been counting on the company for a timely supply of 
planes to boost their fleets.
 Boeing was poised to raise the production of its best-selling family of jets to 38 in June and 42 by January 2024 
from 31 per month currently, Reuters reported earlier this week.
 The problem, disclosed by Boeing on Thursday, involves the installation of two fittings that join the aft fuselage 
made by Spirit AeroSystems to the vertical tail, which were not attached correctly to the structure of the fuselage 
before it was sent to the planemaker.
 The latest quality issue is the second such problem to plague the planemaker this year, after it was briefly forced to 
halt deliveries of 767 freighters.
 The recent discoveries can be attributed to two main factors: less experienced workers and more rigorous 
inspections of aircraft before delivery, Melius Research Vice President Scott Mikus said.
 Boeing, together with Spirit, will have to undertake inspections of the affected MAX 7, MAX 8 and MAX 8200 
airplanes and fuselages.
"Unlike the recent 787 delivery pause in Q1 ... this issue relates to actual non-conforming parts, which will need to 
be inspected (at minimum) or reworked. This likely points to a longer pause this time (BA resumed 787 deliveries 
after ~2 weeks)," Wells Fargo analyst Matthew Akers said.
Boeing Shares Tumble As Some MAX Deliveries Halted, Airlines Fret Over Impact
 Akers, however, added that the impact could be "short term in nature" and that Boeing may push its 2023 cash flow 
goal of $3 billion to $5 billion toward the lower end.
 Airbus shares have outperformed those of Boeing this year
 Shares of Spirit were down more than 20% on Friday.
"We see more negative financial exposure to this news at Spirit than at Boeing," Seifman added.
 The issue could weigh on the fleet-expansion plans of the airlines.
 Southwest Airlines expects the issue to impact its current delivery schedule, while American Airlines said it was 
working with Boeing to understand the effect.
 Europe's Ryanair , which was scheduled to receive 24 737 aircraft over the next 2-1/2 months, said it was working 
with Boeing on the possible impact.

Ryanair assessing impact of Boeing 's half in 737 deliveries
Ryanair assessing impact of Boeing's half in 737 deliveries
Alliance News UK

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Friday that Boeing Co's recent announcement will not affects its current 
fleet of 540 737 aircraft.
"We are assessing with Boeing how this will impact the 24 737 aircraft which are scheduled for delivery in the 
remainder of April, May and June," the Dublin-based budget airline added.
On Friday, US plane maker Boeing warned that production and deliveries of 737 Max, its best-selling plane, will be 
reduced in the near term due to issues with parts supplied by Spirit AeroSystems Holdings.
The problem comes at a time when the airlines worldwide are experiencing a rebound in operations amid the peak 
travel season.
The expected pause in production and deliveries, amid an industry-wide shortage of new jets following the 
pandemic era, is likely to hit Boeing's plan to deliver at least 400 MAXs in 2023.
"We will provide additional information in the days and weeks ahead as we better understand the delivery impacts," 
a company statement said.
The 737 MAX, which is now Boeing's most sought-after model series, was grounded for 20 months following two 
crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed a total of 346 people.
The crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia were attributed to faulty software. In both cases, a sensor provided incorrect 
data to the software, prompting the plane's nose to dive. Pilots were unable to override the automatic settings.
Ryanair shares closed up 0.6% to EUR14.49 each in Dublin on Friday. Meanwhile, Boeing shares lost 5.5% in New 
York.

Only in the North Africa-Levant region - Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco - is there 
more capacity on offer than four years ago, at 103%, the industry association said Thursday.
Domestic air traffic has fallen particularly sharply to 54% of the pre-crisis level.
Compared to the rest of Europe, the number of flights on offer in Germany is comparatively low. Point-to-point 
airlines such as Ryanair and Wizz Air have shifted business and growth from the German market to other countries.
In the rest of Europe except Germany, the number of seats on offer is 97% of the pre-crisis level.

 Zoom today announced  that it has acquired Workvivo , a six-year-old Irish startup focused on improving 
companies' internal communications and culture. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.
 While many enterprise communication tools - such as Zoom - specialize in real-time communication, Workvivo is 
very much about the asynchronous. Indeed, the platform is less about project-specific collaboration than it is about 
fostering employee engagement at a broad level, including an activity feed, people directory, surveys, and critical 
company communications - a bit like a modern day intranet.
 Founded out of Cork in 2017, Workvivo has amassed a fairly impressive roster of customers too, including 
Amazon, RyanAir, and Bupa.

 Workvivo was perfectly positioned to capitalize on the remote-work revolution spurred by the global pandemic, with 
the company reporting a 200%  growth in ARR (annual recurring revenue) in 2020. And this, it seems, was a major 
reason why Zoom has elected to buy Workvivo. In its announcement today, Zoom noted that businesses "need to 
think differently" today in order to retain talent and build a strong company culture.
 "Today's workforce is hybrid and distributed - with people working from home, in an office, at a remote location, on 
the frontlines of a retail floor or warehouse, as a pilot or flight attendant in an airplane, a nurse in a healthcare clinic, 
or anything in between," it wrote. "Engaging employees and driving culture through connection is no longer a 'nice 
to have' - it's imperative for success in today's business environment."
 Workvivo had raised  around $38.5 million since its inception, including a $22 million Series B  last year led by 
existing investor Tiger Global. However, the startup had also fact received a direct angel investment from Zoom 
founder, chairman, and CEO Eric Yuan back in 2019 , making today's announcement perhaps a little less 
surprising.

 TechCrunch reached out to Zoom to confirm the price of the transaction, but a spokesperson said that they 
wouldn't be disclosing the figure.
 Zoom said that it expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2024, which basically means 
by the end of next month. After this, it will set about integrating Workvivo's features into Zoom itself, though there is 
no word on what this will mean for Workvivo in the long run as a standalone platform. Workvivo's founders John 
Goulding and Joe Lennon, and it seems the whole of the Workvivo team, will join Zoom once the deal closes.

Apr 14, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; 
 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - April 14, 2023 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the 
Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks 
and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Airlines' AAL[1], Gol Linhas 
GOL[2], Azul AZUL[3], Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[4] and JetBlue Airways JBLU[5]. 
Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst Blog: Airline Stock Roundup: Q1 Earnings Forecasts and Expansion 
Updates In the past week, American Airlines' management gave an updated outlook for first-quarter 2023. AAL's 
results are likely to be hurt by higher costs. Latin American carriers, Gol Linhas and Azul also grabbed headlines, 
courtesy of their respective March traffic numbers. Upbeat air travel demand aided the traffic reports. 
European carrier, Ryanair Holdings' March traffic numbers were also aided by the rise in air travel demand. 
Meanwhile, an expansion-related update was available from JetBlue Airways in the past week. 
Read the last Airline Roundup here[6]. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1 Driven by soaring demand on healthy 
bookings, AAL's management expects first-quarter 2023 TRASM to be 25.5% higher than the first-quarter 2022 
actuals. This is at the mid-point of the 24-27% uptick expected previously. AAL, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 
(Strong Buy), expects system capacity for the March-end quarter to increase 9.2% from the figure reported in first-
quarter 2022, which again is at the mid-point of the 8-10% uptick expected previously. 
Fuel cost per gallon in first-quarter 2023 is now expected to be in the $3.27-$3.32 range (earlier guidance: $3.33-
$3.38). Fuel gallon consumption is now expected to be $970 million in first-quarter 2023, higher than $955 million 
expected previously. The company continues to expect total non-operating expenses of $415 million for the March-
end quarter. CASM, excluding fuel and special items, is now expected to decrease 1.5% in the first quarter of 2023 
from the figure reported in first-quarter 2022 (earlier guidance: flat to down 3%). 
The adjusted operating margin in the March-end quarter is anticipated to be 3.5% (earlier guidance: 2.5-4.5%). AAL 
now expects the March-end quarter's earnings per share (excluding net special items) to be in the 1-5 cents range 
(earlier guidance called for breakeven earnings). The mid-point of the revised guidance is in line with the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of 3 cents. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank tocks here[7] 
2. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in March was an impressive 12.6 million. This compared 
favorably with the year-ago figure of 11.2 million. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) was 93% in March 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights American Airlines , Gol Linhas, Azul, Ryanair Holdings and JetBlue Airways
2023 compared with 87% a year ago. Ryanair expects its traffic in fiscal 2023 to be 168 million, indicating 13% 
growth from pre-COVID traffic numbers. 
3. Driven by the improvement in air travel demand, Gol Linhas reported healthy traffic data for March. The number 
of passengers ferried on Gol flights in March registered a 22.3% year-over-year increase. The consolidated load 
factor was 82.3% in March 2023 compared with 29.5% a year ago. Load factor increased as consolidated traffic 
growth of 17.2% in the month was more than the capacity expansion (also on a consolidated basis) of 13.3%. 
Domestic departures, which accounted for more than 95% of total departures during the month, have grown 17.4% 
on a year-over-year basis. On the domestic front, the number of seats increased 17.1% in March. 
4. At Azul, consolidated revenue passenger kilometers, a measure of air traffic, showed an increase of 8.1% for 
March 2023 compared with the year-ago reported figure. The company's various codeshare agreements have 
helped increase international air traffic by 89.7% compared with the year-ago figure. A 9.4% increase in capacity 
has resulted in the load factor being at 77.8% for the reported period. 
5. JetBlue, in coordination with Massachusetts Port Authority, announced two new routes from Worcester Regional 
Airport in Massachusetts to attract additional traffic. One of these is a seasonal service from Worcester, MA, to 
Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers, FL. Flights (non-stop) on this route will be operational from 
Jan 4, 2024. The other route will be operating from Worcester, MA to Orlando Sanford International Airport. Flights 
to Orlando, which stopped during the pandemic, will resume[8] operation from Jun 15. Performance Most airline 
stocks have traded in the green over the last five trading days. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index has increased 3.6% 
to $58.47, led by a double-digit gain at Gol Linhas. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index has gained 12.2%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Stay tuned for first-quarter 2023 earnings reports of 
various airlines.

YOU don't need me to tell you that the star of the show on Thursday is Constitution Hill and barring one of the 
biggest shocks in living memory, he will win the William Hill Aintree Hurdle (3.30pm) with ease.
His price of 1/8 suggests just that and the fact firms are betting on how far Nicky Henderson's stable star will win by, 
not if he'll win, shows the superiority he has over his other five rivals despite this being the first time he's run over 
2m4f.
While he is certainly not a betting proposition for me at that sort of price, the 9/4 about ZANAHIYR in the 'without 
the favourite market' is.
Gordon Elliott's charge ran really well in the Champion Hurdle last time and the forecast rain will certainly be in his 
favour, particularly over this longer trip of 2m4f.
He's always been a strong stayer and that asset is why I favour him over Epatante, who is a very speedy mare, so 
the potentially softer ground won't do her any favours.
Constitution Hill is impossible to oppose and I think he'll win this with ease, but I thought Zanahiyr was a solid bet to 
follow him home.
The Anniversary 4-Y-O Juvenile Hurdle (2.20pm) looks at the mercy of Zenta, who ran a cracker when third in the 
Triumph Hurdle at Cheltenham on just her second start for Willie Mullins.
ZANAHIYR TO CHASE HOME SUPERSTAR CONSTITUTION HILL Bill Esdaile previews days one and two 
from the Aintree Grand National Festival
She will likely build on that here and gets weight from most of her rivals too, but I slightly prefer BO ZENITH at the 
prices.
Gary Moore's charge fluffed his lines on his UK debut at Sandown, but has been much better on his two 
subsequent starts at Haydock and Stratford and he looks a nice prospect moving forward.
He might just be one of those horses that takes a bit more time to come to himself and with the rain in his favour - 
won on very soft ground in France - he looks the play at 11/2.
The best race of the day is undoubtably the Aintree Bowl (2.55pm) and you can make a case for pretty much of all 
of the six-strong field.
Bravemansgame brings the best form into the race, but there have to be question marks whether the hard race he 
had when finishing second in the Gold Cup will have left its mark, while Shishkin's run in the Ryanair was very hard 
to assess.
Nicky Henderson's runner could step up again now going over three miles for the first time and will probably win if 
he stays, but I'm going to have a real swing at GA LAW at 40/1.
Granted, he's got plenty to find on ratings, but he won the Paddy Power Gold Cup back in November in good 
fashion and Aintree is a track that should suit.
He was staying on in the Ryanair at Cheltenham last time, so he should appreciate this step up to three miles and I 
just thought he could easily outrun his odds.
We've seen strange results in this race before and I wouldn't totally rule out another.

It is hard to find a city outside Ukraine and Russia more transformed by Vladimir Putin's war than Rzeszów in south-
eastern Poland.
The city, 45 miles from Ukraine's border, has become the main gateway for western allies to ship weapons and 
humanitarian aid, send wounded troops to hospitals in Europe and for world leaders to land at its small airport 
before taking a train to the Ukrainian capital.
Before the invasion of Ukraine, Rzeszów was a "small and conservative place", said one resident, with an airport 
mostly known to low-cost airlines. Now, with Ukraine turned into a no-fly zone, Rzeszów-Jasionka airport doubles 
as a military facility, with a runway lined with Patriot missile defence systems. Hotels are block-booked by army 
subcontractors and international donors.
"It's not as if all roads must lead to Rzeszów, but many now are and more will," Poland's infrastructure minister, 
Andrzej Adamczyk, said while visiting the city. The war made Rzeszów "essential to Ukraine and I believe that such 
processes of change then become irreversible". The scale of Rzeszów's transformation has been astounding for its 
residents. For many years, "almost no foreigner even knew" Rzeszów, said psychologist Jan Markovíc, who runs a 
local cultural association.

"But people from all over the world have now been coming here, so it's a very big change but also a big opportunity 
for us to learn and grow."
The airport's transformation into a western logistics hub for Ukraine was apparently not lost on Russia: Poland last 
month arrested 12 foreigners from unspecified eastern European countries and accused them of spying for Russia 
and preparing sabotage attacks in the Rzeszów area. The authorities also found illegal cameras near the airport.
"It's a real problem if our airport is now a target for Russian intelligence services," said Slawomir Porada, deputy 
mayor of the Trzebownisko municipality that hosts the airport. "It's made people in our community feel much more 
uncomfortable."
The US put Rzeszów on the map in February last year shortly before Russia's attack, when it deployed 
paratroopers to bolster Nato's eastern flank. Its 82nd Airborne Division arrived at an airport that until then had been 
used mostly by budget airline Ryanair.
The airport has also been used by world leaders en route to and from Kyiv, including US president Joe Biden, who 
made a surprise visit to the Ukrainian capital in February, and Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who flew to 
and from Washington last December.
Ryanair now shares the Tarmac with military helicopters and Boeing 747 cargo planes operated by freight carriers 
such as Kalitta and Atlas Air.
The Polish city has been a refreshing change for those previously stationed in war-torn countries such as 
Afghanistan. "Compared to Bagram [air base], this feels amazing," said a mechanic for US subcontractor Amentum, 
which maintains military hardware. "I can try the local beer and food here." The company has booked an entire 
hotel for its employees in Rzeszów.
Near the airport, a medical evacuation centre funded by the EU started last September to dispatch Ukrainian 
patients to hospitals across Europe and bring them home after treatment. "I'm hoping we will not be needed here 
much longer, but I'm also sure we will still want to support Ukraine after the war stops," said Wojciech Solinski, its 
deputy medical co-ordinator.
Vladyslav, a soldier returning to his homeland, stopped at Rzeszów's medevac having had surgery in a Czech 
hospital on a hand partly ripped off in fighting in eastern Ukraine. "I don't want to be back on the frontline but 
perhaps I can do something else to help our army," he said. Asked what he would remember about Rzeszów, he 
said "the people and all the care they have given me".
While many Ukrainians who came to the city went on to other places, tens of thousands have settled, swelling the 
local population by up to 20 per cent. In February, Natalia Anpolska and her two children fled Bakhmut, which has 
en- dured the longest Russian assault and is now a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. She worked on the railways, 
but found a job at a Rzeszów beauty salon.
"I was very worried about not finding work here, so this job is important," she said. "I still want to go home, but only 
without the war."
While locals are proud to help Ukrainians, they also struggle with more aircraft noise and road closures to make 
way for Ukraine-bound convoys. Land prices increased 50 per cent over the past year because "developers now 
think about the military officers who will be living here for the next 10 years or more", Porada said.
After a pandemic lockdown, "it's great for the city to have all hotels and restaurants full", said Anna Brzechowska-
Rebisz, head of the regional tourism board. "But that doesn't mean the war brings economic benefits to everybody 
and encourages more tourists to visit the region outside Rzeszów."

Some residents are already thinking about spearheading Ukraine's postwar reconstruction. Volodomyr Dyba, a 
Ukrainian who fled Donetsk in 2014, found work with a Rzeszów transport company and created his own foundation 
last summer to send humanitarian aid trucks to Ukraine.
"Rzeszów will remain very important after the war because we have all the logistics to rebuild Ukraine," he said.

"It's a real problem if our airport is now a target for Russian intelligence services," said Slawomir Porada, deputy 
mayor of the Trzebownisko municipality that hosts the airport. "It's made people in our community feel much more 
uncomfortable."
The US put Rzeszów on the map in February last year shortly before Russia's attack, when it deployed 
paratroopers to bolster Nato's eastern flank. Its 82nd Airborne Division arrived at an airport that until then had been 
used mostly by budget airline Ryanair.
The airport has also been used by world leaders en route to and from Kyiv, including US president Joe Biden, who 
made a surprise visit to the Ukrainian capital in February, and Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who flew to 
and from Washington last December.
Ryanair now shares the Tarmac with military helicopters and Boeing 747 cargo planes operated by freight carriers 
such as Kalitta and Atlas Air.
The Polish city has been a refreshing change for those previously stationed in war-torn countries such as 
Afghanistan. "Compared to Bagram [air base], this feels amazing," said a mechanic for US subcontractor Amentum, 
which maintains military hardware. "I can try the local beer and food here." The company has booked an entire 
hotel for its employees in Rzeszów.
Near the airport, a medical evacuation centre funded by the EU started last September to dispatch Ukrainian 
patients to hospitals across Europe and bring them home after treatment. "I'm hoping we will not be needed here 
much longer, but I'm also sure we will still want to support Ukraine after the war stops," said Wojciech Solinski, its 
deputy medical co-ordinator.
Vladyslav, a soldier returning to his homeland, stopped at Rzeszów's medevac having had surgery in a Czech 
hospital on a hand partly ripped off in fighting in eastern Ukraine. "I don't want to be back on the frontline but 
perhaps I can do something else to help our army," he said. Asked what he would remember about Rzeszów, he 
said "the people and all the care they have given me".
While many Ukrainians who came to the city went on to other places, tens of thousands have settled, swelling the 
local population by up to 20 per cent. In February, Natalia Anpolska and her two children fled Bakhmut, which has 
en- dured the longest Russian assault and is now a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. She worked on the railways, 
but found a job at a Rzeszów beauty salon.
"I was very worried about not finding work here, so this job is important," she said. "I still want to go home, but only 
without the war."
While locals are proud to help Ukrainians, they also struggle with more aircraft noise and road closures to make 
way for Ukraine-bound convoys. Land prices increased 50 per cent over the past year because "developers now 
think about the military officers who will be living here for the next 10 years or more", Porada said.
After a pandemic lockdown, "it's great for the city to have all hotels and restaurants full", said Anna Brzechowska-
Rebisz, head of the regional tourism board. "But that doesn't mean the war brings economic benefits to everybody 
and encourages more tourists to visit the region outside Rzeszów."

It is hard to find a city outside Ukraine and Russia more transformed by Vladimir Putin's war than Rzeszów in south-
eastern Poland.
The city, 45 miles from Ukraine's border, has become the main gateway for western allies to ship weapons and 
humanitarian aid, send wounded troops to hospitals in Europe and for world leaders to land at its small airport 
before taking a train to the Ukrainian capital.
Before the invasion of Ukraine, Rzeszów was a "small and conservative place", said one resident, with an airport 
mostly known to low-cost airlines. Now, with Ukraine turned into a no-fly zone, Rzeszów-Jasionka airport doubles 
as a military facility, with a runway lined with Patriot missile defence systems. Hotels are block-booked by army 
subcontractors and international donors.
"It's not as if all roads must lead to Rzeszów, but many now are and more will," Poland's infrastructure minister, 
Andrzej Adamczyk, said while visiting the city. The war made Rzeszów "essential to Ukraine and I believe that such 
processes of change then become irreversible". The scale of Rzeszów's transformation has been astounding for its 
residents. For many years, "almost no foreigner even knew" Rzeszów, said psychologist Jan Markovíc, who runs a 
local cultural association.

"But people from all over the world have now been coming here, so it's a very big change but also a big opportunity 
for us to learn and grow."
The airport's transformation into a western logistics hub for Ukraine was apparently not lost on Russia: Poland last 
month arrested 12 foreigners from unspecified eastern European countries and accused them of spying for Russia 
and preparing sabotage attacks in the Rzeszów area. The authorities also found illegal cameras near the airport.
"It's a real problem if our airport is now a target for Russian intelligence services," said Slawomir Porada, deputy 
mayor of the Trzebownisko municipality that hosts the airport. "It's made people in our community feel much more 
uncomfortable."

Apr 13, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, American Airlines' AAL[1] management gave an updated outlook for first-quarter 2023. AAL's 
results are likely to be hurt by higher costs. Latin American carriers, Gol Linhas GOL[2] and Azul AZUL[3] also 
grabbed headlines, courtesy of their respective March traffic numbers. Upbeat air travel demand aided the traffic 
reports. 
European carrier, Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[4] March traffic numbers were also aided by the rise in air travel 
demand. Meanwhile, an expansion-related update was availablefrom JetBlue Airways JBLU[5] in the past week. 
Read the last Airline Roundup here[6]. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1 Driven by soaring demand on healthy 
bookings, AAL's management expects first-quarter 2023 TRASM to be 25.5% higher than the first-quarter 2022 
actuals. This is at the mid-point of the 24-27% uptick expected previously. AAL, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 
(Strong Buy), expects system capacity for the March-end quarter to increase 9.2% from the figure reported in first-
quarter 2022, which again is at the mid-point of the 8-10% uptick expected previously. 
Fuel cost per gallon in first-quarter 2023 is now expected to be in the $3.27-$3.32 range (earlier guidance: $3.33-
$3.38). Fuel gallon consumption is now expected to be $970 million in first-quarter 2023, higher than $955 million 
expected previously. The company continues to expect total non-operating expenses of $415 million for the March-
end quarter. CASM, excluding fuel and special items, is now expected to decrease 1.5% in the first quarter of 2023 
from the figure reported in first-quarter 2022 (earlier guidance: flat to down 3%). The adjusted operating margin in 
the March-end quarter is anticipated to be 3.5% (earlier guidance: 2.5-4.5%). AAL now expects the March-end 
quarter's earnings per share (excluding net special items) to be in the 1-5 cents range (earlier guidance called for 
breakeven earnings). The mid-point of the revised guidance is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 
cents. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank tocks here[7] 
2. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in March was an impressive 12.6 million. This compared 
favorably with the year-ago figure of 11.2 million. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) was 93% in March 
2023 compared with 87% a year ago. Ryanair expects its traffic in fiscal 2023 to be 168 million, indicating 13% 
growth from pre-COVID traffic numbers. 
3. Driven by the improvement in air travel demand, Gol Linhas reported healthy traffic data for March. The number 
of passengers ferried on Gol flights in March registered a 22.3% year-over-year increase. The consolidated load 
Airline Stock Roundup: AAL 's Revised Q1 Forecast, JBLU 's Expansion Update & More
factor was 82.3% in March 2023 compared with 29.5% a year ago. Load factor increased as consolidated traffic 
growth of 17.2% in the month was more than the capacity expansion (also on a consolidated basis) of 13.3%. 
Domestic departures, which accounted for more than 95% of total departures during the month, have grown 17.4% 
on a year-over-year basis. On the domestic front, the number of seats increased 17.1% in March. 
4. At Azul, consolidated revenue passenger kilometers, a measure of air traffic, showed an increase of 8.1% for 
March 2023 compared with the year-ago reported figure. The company's various codeshare agreements have 
helped increase international air traffic by 89.7% compared with the year-ago figure. A 9.4% increase in capacity 
has resulted in the load factor being at 77.8% for the reported period. 
5. JetBlue, in coordination with Massachusetts Port Authority, announced two new routes from Worcester Regional 
Airport in Massachusetts to attract additional traffic. One of these is a seasonal service from Worcester, MA, to 
Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers, FL. Flights (non-stop) on this route will be operational from 
Jan 4, 2024. The other route will be operating from Worcester, MA to Orlando Sanford International Airport. Flights 
to Orlando, which stopped during the pandemic, will resume[8] operation from Jun 15. Performance The following 
table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.

The table above shows that most airline stocks have traded in the green over the last five trading days. The NYSE 
ARCA Airline Index has increased 3.6% to $58.47, led by a double-digit gain at Gol Linhas. Over the course of the 
past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has gained 12.2%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Stay tuned for 
first-quarter 2023 earnings reports of various airlines. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. 
 This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which 
shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top

 In the Netherlands, Neste and Ryanair have expanded their collaboration to enable Ryanair to power its full 
schedule of flights from Amsterdam Airport Schiphol with a 40% blend of Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel from 
April 1 onwards[1]. 
This significant increase in SAF usage represents the latest milestone towards Ryanair's ambitious goal of 
operating 12.5% of flights with SAF by 2030 and further supports Ryanair's 'Pathway to Net Zero by 2050' 
decarbonisation goals, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from Ryanair's flights from the Amsterdam Airport by 
32%.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin International) appears to have lost an appeal it lodged in Hungary last year against a consumer 
protection fine of HUF300 million forints (USD871,000), the Magyar Távirati Iroda (MTI) news agency reported the 
country's justice ministry as saying.
The Budapest Court of Appeal ruled against the low-cost carrier's bid to overturn the fine, which had been levied for 
passing on to consumers the cost of a windfall profit tax, the news source said. The airline has also appealed to the 
courts of the European Union against what it calls the "baseless fine".
In a Facebook post, Nóra Kupecki, deputy minister of state for consumer protection at the Ministry of Justice, 
elaborated that "the court decided the airline will not receive immediate legal protection" but that "the fine is not yet 
legal, so we await the court's next decision."
She added: "We promised that in the case of passing on the extra-profit special tax we would launch a consumer 
protection investigation in every case, because the economic situation created as a result of sanctioned inflation 
requires that any multinational company that gains extra profit must take its share of the costs of overhead 
protection and national defence! In Hungary, the laws apply to everyone, even if some feel exempt from it."
Ryanair has repeatedly demanded that the nationalist government of Viktor Orbán scrap the tax placed on airlines 
of EUR10 to EUR25 (USD10.90-27.30) per passenger departing Hungary starting from July 2022. The measure 
targets "extra profits" earned by airlines, as well as banks, insurers, energy and telecoms companies, and large 
retail chains, promising to use the funds to compensate consumers for inflation blamed on the war in Ukraine and to 
fund further defence spending.

Analysis-Easter Travel Warnings Pile Pressure On European Airlines

European aviation is gearing up for Easter travel disruptions marked by strikes and cancellations, in a major test of 
the industry's ability to prevent a repeat of last year's summer holiday season chaos.
 Strikes have rolled through France, Portugal, Britain and Germany in recent weeks and could cause air travel 
disruption in parts of Europe through the Easter holidays, officials at airlines, airports and air traffic authorities told 
Reuters.
"There will be delays. There's no doubt about it," said Steven Moore, who is in charge of air traffic management 
operations at Eurocontrol.
 Details of the delays remain unclear but the warnings illustrate how vulnerable aviation remains to external 
pressures, despite efforts to avoid a repeat of last year's queues and cancellations.
 Airlines are frustrated at the escalation in industrial action after they have worked for months to tackle the pressing 
problem of labour shortages via better coordination and by staffing up for a potential return to pre-pandemic traffic 
levels.
"I think it's something that we have to plan for and we're doing our best to try to mitigate that. But it's, of course, 
very difficult because ... you sometimes get only 24-hours notice," easyJet CEO Johan Lundgren said.
 That is unlikely to quell a debate over the European Union's strict passenger compensation rules. Airlines say they 
have to pay compensation without themselves getting compensated for air traffic delays.
 Consumer groups say air traffic control strikes are not new and airlines should be quicker to react and pay 
compensation.
 European consumer lobby BEUC said consumer pre-payments for air tickets should be phased out, especially in 
times of disruption, as airlines often spend that money quickly leaving consumers struggling for months to get their 
money back.
Analysis-Easter Travel Warnings Pile Pressure On European Airlines
 The spectre of new delays came as France was gripped by the latest in a series of national protests over pension 
reform on Thursday.
 France's strikes alone have caused thousands of hours of delays so far - sometimes triggering 70,000 minutes of 
delays in one day, based on data shared by Eurocontrol.
 If a flight is delayed early in the day, there is a compounding effect as planes arrive later and take off later in their 
destination airports, causing systemic issues.
 Since March 13, France's civil aviation authority DGAC has almost daily required airlines to cut their flights by 20% 
to 30% at several airports, including Paris's second biggest hub Orly.
 Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has complained that those strikes disrupt the ability of airlines to cross through 
French airspace, where overflights represent about 15% of European traffic, according to Eurocontrol.
 He called last week on the European Commission to do more to stop such strikes hitting overflights, by introducing 
minimum service rules, though industry experts say strikes are a national issue.
 The disruptions are coinciding with a recovery in travel demand. Departures from Britain during the Easter 
weekend are set to go up 11% compared with last year and by 650% since 2021, although they will remain about 
13% lower than before the pandemic, based on Cirium data.
 And there's little sign of reconciliation in France.
 Fabrice Criquet, secretary general of the Force Ouvriere union at Paris airports operator ADP, said the only way for 
the situation to return to normal was for President Emmanuel Macron's government to withdraw the pension reform.
"Strikes aim to disrupt operations by definition, that's what they do, we have been protesting for months over this 
pension reform and will continue to do so," he told Reuters.
 CALL FOR SOLUTIONS
 Strikes by labour unions from various industries have caused travel disruptions across Germany in recent weeks, 
with some industry executives calling for a new approach to the disputes to minimise the ongoing tumult.
 At Frankfurt Airport alone, more than 300,000 passengers were unable to fly due to the strikes.
"For us, this has meant a significant million euro amount in terms of lost revenue," head of Frankfurt Airport Stefan 
Schulte told Reuters.
"We have to ask ourselves whether it would not be better to have a coordinated truce for critical infrastructure. To 
not have different strikes at different times, which always affect the overall system so strongly," he added.
 In Portugal, border control officers are set to strike this week as well as train workers.
 Algarve's Hotels and Tourism Enterprises Association have called for preventive action, warning that border control 
strikes could have dire impacts on the region's reputation with tourists - a key driver of Algarve's economy.
 Airlines and airports, criticised in the media and parliaments for their handling of last year's air travel surge, say 
they are hamstrung by the fact that they have almost no influence on Europe's spiralling industrial unrest. Other 
sectors have also been severely hit, however.
"[Our members,] they're worried, but let's say they are reasonably worried. They have done a lot of work to make 
sure that this goes reasonably well," said Olivier Jankovec, the head of airports industry group ACI Europe.
"How do you prevent strikes? This is not something you can really prevent, because you can't receive a 20% salary 
increase like this overnight."

From Sunday, March 26, the summer flight season starts at M. R. Stefánik Airport, which brings 37 direct routes, of 
which 4 are new regular routes that you can easily reach from Bratislava. The flight schedule in aviation changes 2 
times a year, together with the time change. The summer flight schedule will be valid until the next time change, i.e. 
until October 28, 2023.
Among the novelties is also a direct route to the Baltic region, to the Lithuanian city of Kaunas, which will be 
operated by Ryanair, starting from March 27, 2023. The line will be serviced up to 3 times a week, on Monday, 
Wednesday, and Friday. Kaunas became the European Capital of Culture in 2022. Interesting is not only the 
historical city, but also the number of galleries, museums, and cafes. The city is also known for its local ,,street art" 
festival. Kaunas is about an hour's drive by car from the capital of Lithuania, Vilnius. A direct flight to Kaunas takes 
less than 2 hours.
There will be a direct connection to the holiday destination of Marsa Alam, in Egypt. In addition to the route to 
Hurghada, another connection will be added within the sought-after holiday destinations in this country. The flight 
connection will be operated by Air Cairo. The route will be launched on March 31. The resort is ideal for lovers of 
windsurfing and diving. The coral reefs in the area offer abundant marine life, ideal for dolphin watching. The flight 
to Marsa Alam takes approximately 4 hours and a half.
Another novelty is a direct flight connection to Montenegro, the metropolis of Podgorica. For travellers, it is thus 
possible to reach this country in less than an hour and a half directly from Bratislava. The flight connection will be 
operated by Air Montenegro. There will be flights to Montenegro twice a week, on Tuesday and Saturday. The route 
will be launched on June 17, 2023. The city of Podgorica is approximately 65 kilometres from the sea. The country

Tax rates still have very real-world consequences

JUST how important are tax rates for economic growth? It's obvious there would be somewhat different economic 
outcomes with rates of 0 per cent and 100 per cent, but more recently a mainstream consensus seems to view 
changes to rates within a 'sensible' range as not especially important.
It is said, for instance, that Rishi Sunak doesn't buy into the idea that successive cuts to the headline rates of 
corporation tax since 2010 - down to 19 per cent until recently - were the main driver behind higher levels of 
investment and more revenues for Treasury coffers. Instead, so the argument goes, other measures such as capital 
allowances are more important.
But either way, incentives matter - including changes to the headline rate. And Rishi himself has set off a glut of 
activity thanks to a tax cut he made while Chancellor. That was cutting the rate of domestic air passenger duty in 
half, with flights within the UK now taxed at £6.50, down from £13.
It has seen a surge in new and restored domestic routes, with British Airways, Easyjet and Ryanair all expecting 
increased demand. Aer Lingus is expected to launch a flight from Belfast City to Newquay. Ryanair is also eyeing 
up the Cornish holiday hotspot with a flight from Stansted; the carrier is also opening routes such as Edinburgh to 
Bournemouth.
There are likely other factors at play, but Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary couldn't be clearer on the driving 
force behind the expanded services: "The halving of APD on domestic flights from April 2023 has allowed Ryanair 
to add more domestic routes to our UK schedule."
Tax rates still have very real-world consequences
On a less positive note, Ithaca Energy is reluctant to dive headfirst into the Rosebank oil project, as reported in 
yesterday's City A.M. Its executive chairman, Gilad Myerson, noted that when faced with the so-called windfall tax 
"a company faces excessive taxation, then ultimately it needs to review its investments".
So maybe tax rates do matter, after all.

INDUSTRIALS REIT

A potential swoop from Blackstone for commercial landlord Industrials REIT "looks very good" according to analysts 
at Peel Hunt. Under the terms, shareholders are set to receive 168p per share in cash, a 42 per cent premium on 
Friday's closing price. Peel Hunt analysts said it was a juicy deal for shareholders given that industrial asset values 
have fallen by 22 per cent since. They say hold the stock at a target of 135p.

Low-cost airline Ryanair topped forecasts in March as the firm recorded some 12.6m passengers, up 12.5 per cent 
on last year. Analysts at Peel Hunt have reiterated their buy rating and said that the number was a "positive" and 
achieved despite air-traffic control strikes in France during March and with Easter falling in April. The figures "bode 
very well for yields during the period," they added.

Apr 04, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] is benefiting from buoyant air-travel demand (particularly on the leisure front). The 
company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
However, escalated fuel costs are limiting the bottom-line growth. Factors Favoring RYAAY The gradual 
improvement in air-travel demand is a huge boon for Ryanair. Owing to this tailwind, the company reported healthy 
traffic data for March. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in March was an impressive 12.6 million. 
This compared favorably with the year-ago figure of 11.2 million. 
Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) was 93% in March 2023 compared with 87% a year ago. Ryanair 
expects its traffic in fiscal 2023 to be 168 million, indicating 13% growth from the pre-COVID-19 traffic numbers. 
Ryanair's measures to expand its fleet to cater to the improvement in travel demand are encouraging. The 
company's efforts to bring down its debt levels are commendable as well. Net debt at RYAAY declined to €0.96 
billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended Dec 31, 2022) from €1.45 billion at the end of the fourth 
quarter of fiscal 2022. Key Risks Rising fuel prices thanks to the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war pose a threat to 
Ryanair's bottom line. The airline's fuel and oil expenses increased by more than 200% year over year in the first 
half of fiscal 2023 due to a rise in sectors flown and high jet fuel prices. Fuel costs increased 52% in the fiscal third 
quarter. 
Apart from higher fuel prices, the ramp-up in the airline's operations is pushing up total costs. Operating costs were 
up 36% in the fiscal third quarter. Labor-related tensions also do not bode well. Stocks to Consider Some better-
ranked stocks in the Zacks Transportation [2]sector are Copa Holdings CPA[3] and GATX Corporation GATX[4]. 
Copa Holdings' focus on its cargo segment is very encouraging. In fourth-quarter 2022, cargo and mail revenues 
jumped 69% to $27.09 million, owing to higher cargo volumes and yields. Currently, CPA sports a Zacks Rank #1 
(Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.[5] 
For first-quarter and full-year 2023, CPA's earnings are expected to register 485% and 40.5% growth, respectively, 
on a year-over-year basis. 
GATX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. The gradual improvement in the North American railcar leasing 
market is a huge positive for the company. Management expects a recovery in the North American railcar leasing 
market to continue in 2023. 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Rides on Buoyant Air Traffic Despite Cost Woes
We are also impressed by GATX's measures to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks despite 
the economic uncertainty. For full-year 2023, its earnings are expected to register 10.5% growth on a year-over-
year basis.

Ryanair is a buy with Peel Hunt after the budget airline posted total passengers ahead of forecasts for March, with a 
target price of (EURO)20.
Competitor Wizz Air also remains a buy with the broker at a target price of 3,650p, although it performed below 
expectations in last month.
Regarding Ryanair, Peel Hunt said March passenger volumes were "positive" at 12.6mln passengers, representing 
12.5% year-on-year growth and a load factor of 93%.
"This increases the total number of passengers to 168.6mln, higher than the 168mln previous guidance and out 
167.5mln" on a rolling 12-month basis, said the broker.
This is a positive for the carrier, as it was achieved despite air traffic control strikes in France and with Easter 
looming, bodes a positive for yields.
Wizz Air during March operated "slightly less capacity" than the broker anticipated, with 4.63mln seats compared to 
4.8mln.
Despite a load factor of 92.2% being 2.2% ahead of its estimates, passenger volume growth of 72.3% to 4.267mln 
was still below expectations of 4.32mln.
For the fiscal year 2023, volumes of 51.07mln were lower than estimates of 51.924mln due to low numbers in the 
fourth quarter.
Ryanair and Wizz Air have contrasting March but remain buys with broker
However, the broker retained its buy due to a "high level of growth and recent weakness in the oil price" which 
should allow the airline to extend hedging at advantageous rates.

GA Telesis (GAT) has announced the delivery of the first of two scheduled Boeing 737-800SF aircraft to Bluebird 
Nordic (BBN).
The aircraft, owned by Tokyo Century (TC), was delivered from Aeronautical Engineering (AEI). It was 
manufactured in 2004 and completed previous lease terms with Ryanair and Nok Air, Airfinance Journal's Fleet 
Tracker data shows.
GAT managed the conversion and remarketing of the aircraft and will remain involved as lease manager moving 
forward.
GA Telesis' leasing, investment, financing and trading group entered the air cargo sector in 2021 and has continued 
at pace with five aircraft converted and delivered since.
The TC cooperation has allowed the extension of the economic life of one of their owned 737 aircraft, which begins 
a second life as a freighter aircraft "with a top-tier European cargo operator", says GAT.
"GA Telesis is delighted to have managed this transaction on behalf of our shareholder successfully," said senior 
vice president of the asset transaction group, David Ellis. "This deal reiterates the GA Telesis value-add proposition 
with respect to managed aircraft, and we are very grateful for the cooperation of both Tokyo Century and BBN," 
added Ellis.
"We are grateful to Tokyo Century Corporation and GA Telesis for a very professional execution of the transaction - 
as Bluebird Nordic continues to grow its Boeing 737-800 freighters fleet", said Bluebird Nordic's chief executive 
officer Audrone Keinyte.
TC also has 777F and A330F aircraft in its current portfolio, Fleet Tracker shows. These are on lease to Aerologic 
and EAT Leipzig.
GAT has various other 737-800SFs in its current portfolio, including aircraft on lease to Ethiopian Cargo and 
Compass Air Cargo, as well as a single 747-400F with ASL Belgium, according to the data.

Hot reception for EU sustainability taxonomy
Hot reception for EU sustainability taxonomy
AirFinance Journal

Body
Both airlines and environmental groups have reacted strongly to new sections of the European Union's Taxonomy 
of Sustainable Economic Activities, published for consultation just before Easter, reports Airfinance Journal's sister 
publication GlobalCapital.
Transport & Environment, an NGO based in Brussels that contributed to shaping the Taxonomy, reacted angrily to 
new criteria for shipping and aviation.
"Planes and ships that run on fossil fuels could be given 'green' investment status," it said, calling this decision "the 
'nail in the coffin' of the EU's Taxonomy".
T&E called on the European Parliament to fight the delegated act. More than 90% of the aircraft Airbus's customers 
have ordered could be considered green, it said, while nearly a third of Ryanair's future fleet would qualify.
Ships powered by liquefied natural gas would be admitted to the Taxonomy, even though claims that they lower 
emissions ignore the methane leaks during LNG's manufacture and use.
"There are going to be two kinds of fightback on this one," said Sean Kidney, chief executive of the Climate Bonds 
Initiative, who has been a member of the Platform on Sustainable Finance that advises the EC on the Taxonomy 
throughout the process of its creation.
He was referring to new criteria for the Taxonomy's first two chapters, on climate change mitigation and adaptation, 
which define standards for shipping, aviation and some manufacturing industries. "On shipping and aviation they've 
largely adopted the recommendations we put through at the Platform last year, with a few changes made for the 
short term, the next five years," Kidney said.
"There will be, I suspect, environmental groups criticising it," he added.
"We need to understand exactly what, because Transport & Environment was intimately involved in developing the 
Platform recommendations. There's a softening of the edges of the criteria that people are going to be concerned 
about, but I would expect the bulk of it to go through."
Hot reception for EU sustainability taxonomy
The other kind of fightback would be from industry. "We've had calls from airlines saying 'do you think this is 
possible? You are capping growth - how can you do that to us?' So I think there will be very strong fightback from 
the aviation sector. We'll see how the Commission copes with it."
Cleaner flying
Both the CBI and the Platform will opine formally on the recommendations in the next few weeks, so Kidney was 
reluctant to comment in detail before that.
But he said: "The zero tailpipe [condition] which is the majority of the shipping and aviation criteria is absolutely spot 
on."
He was referring to the Taxonomy's insistence on the principle that sustainable ships and aircraft should move 
towards zero emissions from their exhaust, even if the criteria will temporarily be much looser until those 
technologies are fully developed.
"The main response from aviation is they are saying 'that's impossible, when's it going to happen?'," Kidney said. 
"I'm saying we're already seeing battery-powered aircraft in operation short haul, and hydrogen planes from Airbus 
could be on sale in 2027 - it's been delayed from 2025 because they didn't think the hydrogen would be available."
In the short term, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could be scaled up very quickly, Kidney said.
Kidney is convinced that SAF is a "credible"  transition fuel. "Whatever happens, we have to kill kerosene in the 
aviation industry. SAF is not perfect or a long-term solution but it is a fast action that can effectively reduce 
emissions in the next 10 to 15 years, while we get batteries and hydrogen going," he said. "The long-term is zero 
tailpipe."
SAF is appealing because most aircraft can take between 20% and 100% SAF in their existing engines.
In the high-emission aviation and shipping sectors, the Taxonomy criteria may be fought over, but these industries 
are ultimately likely to find them useful guidance, to add to the standards their own industry bodies are already 
setting.
Tonia Plakhotniuk, vice-president, climate and ESG capital markets at NatWest Markets in London, pointed out that 
the shipping and aviation industries were "not being designated as green but as transition". The Taxonomy 
Regulation will require companies to report transition activities separately from fully sustainable ones.
And she said the Taxonomy was "just one tool [to] measure environmental performance of companies or financing 
provided to companies."
Wading through the rules
But the arrival of new criteria is not just a matter of plunging straight into hot debates about whether the 
environmental standards are too strict or too loose.
There is a thicket of difficulties in actually implementing and applying the Taxonomy before companies and 
investors can fully tackle those questions in practice.
The European Commission's grand design for the Taxonomy, conceived in 2018 on the advice of sustainable 
finance experts, was to define standards for activities right across the economy that investors can consider 
sustainable because they improve the environment in one of six ways.
All companies and financial firms now have to report what percentages of their activities are sustainable, according 
to the Taxonomy.
Hot reception for EU sustainability taxonomy
Yet up to now, criteria have only been introduced for two environmental benefits: climate change mitigation and 
adaptation. The other four - water, biodiversity, the circular economy and pollution control - are not covered.
On April 5 the EC published for the first time draft delegated acts (secondary legislation) that establish the criteria 
for these four issues. Market participants were given a brief window in which to comment, until May 3.
These four chapters mean all six basic pillars of the Taxonomy now exist, at least in draft form. But there are still 
large gaps, even in the climate criteria.
In each chapter, the EC is filling in the criteria gradually, tackling some of the most relevant economic activities first.
Alongside the new chapters, the EC also published amendments to the existing rules for climate change adaptation 
and mitigation - where the new shipping and aviation criteria come in.
Slow burner
The condemnation from some quarters added to the sense that the new Taxonomy criteria would not have 
"immediate impact," said Jacob Michaelsen, head of sustainable finance advisory at Nordea Markets in 
Copenhagen.
"I've got past the point of considering the Taxonomy as a stringently scientific tool for the financial markets," he 
said. "It's much more a political and economic guidance tool. Tell me anyone who is implementing the Taxonomy to 
the fullest today, except for certain peculiar small institutions. But that's not to say that it is in any way futile - it's 
clearly not."
The Taxonomy's original introduction, he said, had been "mind-blowing. Can you imagine us being in a world with 
as much concentration on sustainable initiatives, if we had not had the Taxonomy? This is a much better world to 
be part of than had it not been."
However, Michaelsen said the impact of these new criteria would be significantly less than that of the first few 
Taxonomy rounds, "partly because they have been delayed so long that you can't keep up the excitement. The 
marginal change from no Taxonomy to a climate Taxonomy is greater than from a climate Taxonomy to having the 
rest."
Plakhotniuk said the four new chapters of criteria would have a twofold effect. On one hand, they would "provide 
precision and guidance on additional activities that are considered environmentally sustainable and will set an 
aspirational benchmark for companies."
On the other hand, like the existing climate criteria, "the new criteria are highly technical, specific to the EU 
environment (i.e. referencing [other EU] legislation throughout) and will take time for the market to digest and 
implement."
On biodiversity, for example, the delegated acts set criteria for protecting and restoring ecosystems, which was 
helpful as "the market has been struggling to measure significant contribution to this objective," Plakhotniuk said.
But that would not solve the problem of how to scale financing of nature and biodiversity projects by the private 
sector, as they were "not easy to do on a commercially viable basis".
In the background
Though the Taxonomy may have helped inspire wider consciousness of sustainability in financial markets, as 
Michaelsen argues, even the existing Taxonomy rules on climate have so far only had a limited direct impact on the 
sustainable finance market.
Since 2022, all companies big enough to use the capital markets have had to report what percentages of their 
revenues, capital expenditure and operating expenditure are for activities for which the Taxonomy has sustainability 
Hot reception for EU sustainability taxonomy
criteria, making them 'Taxonomy-eligible'. This year for the first time they also have to say how much actually 
satisfies the criteria, known as 'Taxonomy-aligned'.
In theory, having gone through the headaches of classifying their revenues and spending in those ways, companies 
can now all quite easily use the Taxonomy classifications when they structure sustainable financings such as green 
bonds. In practice, few are doing so.
"The issuers that have made the most forward-looking statements that they are going to map their green bonds to 
the Taxonomy or the EU Green Bond Standard tend to be quite frequent and sophisticated green bond issuers, 
which have got sufficient confidence that their green use of proceeds expenditures will be 100% Taxonomy-
aligned," said Arthur Krebbers, head of corporate climate and ESG capital markets at NatWest Markets in 
Amsterdam.
Power companies like Tennet, Energie Baden-Württemberg and Electricit& de France can classify 100% of their 
green use of proceeds as Taxonomy-aligned, so they have formally done so.
Most second opinion providers offer assessment of Taxonomy alignment as an additional service, Krebbers said.
But there are "different shades of alignment," he said. Quite often, companies approach banks to talk about green 
bonds, saying they are Taxonomy-aligned, when all they mean is that in broad terms their business activities 
contribute towards the Taxonomy's objectives.
That kind of alignment might be accepted for less specifically designed classifications such as the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals, but true Taxonomy alignment requires complying with detailed criteria for making a substantial 
contribution to one of the six environmental objectives, and meeting the Taxonomy requirements for 'doing no 
significant harm' (DNSH) to any of the other objectives, such as water and biodiversity, as well as complying with 
minimum social safeguards, such as on labour rights.
Aligning with the Taxonomy may be impossible if the criteria for certain business activities have not been defined 
yet. For example, many services companies do not have relevant criteria.
Another difficulty is that if some of the uses of proceeds have yet to be identified, the issuer would have to make a 
forward-looking statement that it expected some of them to be aligned in future.
So far, most green bond issuers for which only some of the uses of proceeds would be likely to formally qualify as 
Taxonomy-aligned have not gone through with describing their green bonds as partially aligned.
That is perfectly legitimate: there is no EU requirement to report Taxonomy alignment for green bonds, and the EU 
Green Bond Standard remains voluntary.
"The latest ICMA green bond guidance recommends where possible to align with relevant local or regional 
taxonomies, but it is not a mandatory requirement," said Krebbers. "My expectation is that in the European green 
bond market we will continue to see GBS and Taxonomy-aligned issuance and ICMA-aligned issuance, with the 
latter consisting of sectors which the Taxonomy hasn't comprehensively covered, as well as non-EU issuers."
So the green bond market has not really tested yet whether relative degrees of partial Taxonomy alignment are a 
helpful guide for investors.
"Investors are being encouraged to align with the Taxonomy, but they also do their own homework," said Krebbers. 
"They won't blindly follow the Taxonomy. The classic case is nuclear: there are various ESG investors who do not 
intend to follow the Taxonomy criteria on it and maintain their own exclusions."
Controversially, nuclear power was admitted to the Taxonomy last year after pressure from France and Finland, 
even though it is hard to argue there is no risk of it doing significant harm to the environment.
The spirit is willing
Hot reception for EU sustainability taxonomy
Plakhotniuk said green and sustainable bond issuers were keen to use the new criteria to assess eligible projects 
for deals - "the will is surely there".
"However, implementing the criteria in practice won't be ... any easier than for climate objectives," she said. The 
criteria are granular and technical and "Assessment of do no significant harm will remain a pain point for years to 
come as challenges associated with the DNSH assessments have not yet been resolved."
Also, Plakhotniuk said, "the more jurisdictions come up with their own taxonomies, the more resource-intensive it 
would be for issuers and investors to assess what is considered green in different countries and how to make 
judgement on the equivalence of these frameworks."
Issuers' reluctance to use the Taxonomy for their sustainable financings was "less about just the process of getting 
it up and running - it's also about having the confidence in it," said Michaelsen. "Even though there might be a 
number they are working with, they are just not comfortable" using it to market a bond.
Nordea's ESG research team has been assessing companies' Taxonomy alignment for two years, and this year for 
the first time has been able to compare its estimates with the figures reported by companies.
For most kinds of company, the ESG researchers were much more optimistic on the levels of alignment and 
eligibility than the companies themselves. "Corporates in general are being conservative because they have a hard 
time understanding what the Taxonomy means for them and they really want to be on the safe side," said 
Michaelsen.
The exception is energy companies, where carbon emissions and reducing them are core to the business model. 
Their alignment figures were higher than the researchers had calculated.
Michaelsen's conclusion from these mismatches is that: "We are now being asked to speak the same language, but 
it doesn't mean we can talk to each other yet. Some of these things will take time. We will probably see better 
alignment on climate over the years and probably it will happen with biodiversity etc, but it will be much longer term 
than we have been used to expecting."

The head of budget giant Ryanair drew a line under a rare public spat with Boeing on Wednesday by confirming 
talks over potentially ordering at least 100 new jets - but insisted significant discounts would still be needed to 
unlock a deal.
Europe's largest budget carrier halted negotiations for at least 100 Boeing 737 MAX 10 jets in a pricing dispute 
towards the end of the COVID-19 crisis some 18 months ago.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on Wednesday Mar. 29 Ryanair was now considering the 200-seat 737 MAX 
8200 and the 230-seat 737 MAX 10 "as long as the price parameters are acceptable".
A potential deal for 100 planes, plus 100 options, is likely to take several months to negotiate, he told Reuters on 
the sidelines of an A4E airline conference in Brussels.
Boeing shares were up 1% at mid-session in New York.
He also said he expected the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to certify the 737 MAX 7, Boeing's smallest 
model, in the first half of 2023 and the MAX 10 to win approval from U.S. regulators towards the end of this year.
Ryanair is one of Boeing's largest customers and is seen as one of a handful of airlines that can insist on the best 
prices in their region, alongside U.S. carrier Southwest Airlines.
In late 2021, O'Leary accused Boeing of trying to impose a "delusionary" price increase and declared a "marital rift" 
between the Irish carrier and its long-time sole supplier.
Boeing said at the time it valued Ryanair's business but had to exercise discipline. On Wednesday, it declined 
comment.
Industry sources had said the breakdown was a test of two competing views on the speed of the post-COVID 
recovery, with Boeing gaining confidence from renewed sales of the MAX following a safety crisis and Ryanair 
prepared to wait it out.
Ryanair says price still key to new 100 Boeing 737 Max jet deal
O'Leary told the Financial Times last week that talks had resumed. On Wednesday, O'Leary said the breakthrough 
came after Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun and Stan Deal, head of its commercial division, approached 
Ryanair two months ago.
"They are back talking to us; I think it takes maybe six, nine months to get a deal done," he added.
The Ryanair CEO voiced support for Calhoun and said he hoped Boeing's management would stabilise "over a 
number of years", adding the company had been through a rough period of delays.
"I think Calhoun is putting together a good team and we would like to see that team stabilise over a number of 
years, and we could get back to kind of normal for doing business relations," he said.

European airlines have warned that air traffic controller strikes in France will cause further travel disruption for 
passengers this year.
French air traffic controllers have joined a series of strikes called by unions this month against President Emmanuel 
Macron's unpopular pension reforms.
The disruption has rippled across Europe because air traffic controllers are responsible for planes flying over their 
airspace, as well as those landing and taking off from French airports.
EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said yesterday that the airline was "very badly hit" because UK flights 
often have to cross French airspace to reach other parts of Europe.
"It is something we have to plan for, and we are doing our best to try to mitigate it, but of course it is very difficult ... 
sometimes you only get 24 hours notice," he said.
Michael O'Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, said this summer would be "materially better" than in 2022 when staff 
shortages led to an unprecedented set of delays and cancellations.
But he said airlines still faced a "very difficult" challenge, mainly because of the "scandal" of delays and 
cancellations caused by the French strike.
European flights disruption set to continue; Airlines
Europe's skies are already congested because of the closure of Russian and Ukrainian airspace and Eurocontrol, 
the EU's air traffic manager, warned in January of "major" pressure as airlines returned to close to their pre-
pandemic flight schedules.
O'Leary added that he expected strikes to continue into April, which would affect the Easter getaway. He said 
Ryanair had to cancel 60 flights scheduled on both Wednesday and Thursday at short notice. Europe's largest low-
cost airline also cancelled 230 flights last weekend.
DGAC, the French civil aviation authority, said domestic and regional flight schedules were more likely to be 
affected than long haul owing to the increased disruption involved in rescheduling the latter. The aviation authority 
added it has no visibility into strike actions in the coming weeks because unions only have to notify them shortly 
before they go on strike.
Ryanair has called on the European Commission to introduce minimum service rules to prioritise flights over France 
during industrial action.
An EU official said the commission was "closely monitoring" the strikes as it weighed the proper functioning of its 
internal market with the right to strike.
Security staff at Heathrow are also due to begin a 10-day walkout tomorrow, leading British Airways to cancel about 
300 flights.
The industry is under pressure to improve its operations following chaotic scenes last summer.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) is in talks to order at least 100 new planes from Boeing (BOE.L, BOEI.BR), though a deal will still 
depend on "acceptable" pricing, Reuters reported Wednesday. 
Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary said the budget airline is weighing a purchase of the 737 Max 8200 and the 
737 Max 10. The potential order comes months after the parties suspended negotiations for at least 100 737 Max 
10 jets over pricing disagreements.
The CEO noted that negotiations for the 100 planes and equivalent options could take several months.

RYANAIR boss Michael O'Leary yesterday slammed the 'scandal' of late-notice French air traffic controller strikes 
and begged European Union bosses to step in with legislation.
In a typically stinging broadside, the outspoken airline chief said it was a "scandal" that French strikes have blocked 
flights over the country's airspace, with often only days' notice.
While international flights taking off or departing from the country receive minimum service levels during walkouts 
that allow them to continue, flights that use the airspace above do not receive the same protections.
France is currently wracked with industrial unrest due to President Emmanuel Macron's changes to the retirement 
age and pensions, though air traffic controller strikes across the country have become something of an annual 
tradition.
The late-notice cancellation of flights over France hits a number of busy flight paths, including Ryanair's 
important,and profitable, Britain to Spain routes.
The EU needs to step in to ensure minimum service levels on so-called overflights, the chief executive said.
O'Leary also warned that air fares are set to jump by more than 10 per cent this year thanks to cost inf lation.

Mar 30, 2023( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 European airlines are concerned that Europe is losing its advantage over the United States when it comes to the 
production of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and e-fuels, which are produced from green electricity and hydrogen. 
The concerns were voiced by airline associationAirlines 4 Europe[1] (A4E) during its Aviation Summit in Brussels on 
Wednesday. A4E concerned that Europe loses out on sustainable fuels. 
Since the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of the Biden Administration was passed, this is already resulting in energy 
companies postponing investments in European facilities or moving them to the US, where they can benefit from 
incentives. The European Commission has responded to IRA with its own Net Zero Industry Act, but A4E member 
airlines want Europe to move away from the current mandate policy that is part of theFit for 55 program[2] to 
incentive schemes that are working very well in the US. 
'The US may be a little behind Europe when it comes to promoting SAF, but their system of incentives is starting to 
become very effective. They create tax advantages for users and buyers to use these fuels and increase the 
production volumes of these fuels in order to decarbonize our industry. That's something we are missing in Europe, 
we are missing any support in this regard,' said Carsten Spohr, outgoing Chair of A4E. 'Europe, through mandates, 
is forcing us to buy non-existing volumes of SAF at crazy prices that are five times higher than kerosene. () 
Governments, airlines, our industry but also society need to show commitment to the investments to scale up SAFs 
and bring down the price quickly because there is already a race going on about where these investments are going 
to build up volumes.' 
Spohr warned that Europe could be losing its advantage. 'We already lost the race on batteries, we lost the race on 
solar panels. We now also risk losing the race for synthetic fuels, which once again shows that Europe is not 
competing where it should be.' A4E voiced its concerns not just during the press conference on Wednesday, but 
also the previous day when Commissioner Frans Timmermans was invited to the CEO table. 
'We ask the question: where are those billions of environmental taxes going? We as an industry accept to pay those 
taxes, but we rightfully ask the question what the hell has happened with them? Europe should at least subsidize or 
incentivize the rapid production of SAF,' Group CEO Michael O'Leary of Ryanair said. 
Same concerns 
During the Summit, A4E called on the European Union and policymakers to strengthen and secure the 
competitiveness of European aviation. The airlines note that essential reforms have stalled for a number of years on 
A4E concerned that Europe loses out on sustainable fuels
key topics like the airport charges directive, taxes, the reform of passenger rights under the EU261 rule, and the 
Single European Sky[3] (SES). 
Aspointed out here[4] by AirInsight already in 2021, the problem is that the airlines and A4E have not had any 
success in pushing these points, which have been on the agenda of each A4E Aviation Summit for the past seven 
years now. It made moderator Richard Quest of the CEO panel wonder why the lobby of A4E with the European 
Commission has not been effective and if it shouldn't start getting tough and make a strong message to politicians 
and the public. 
Carsten Spohr said: 'I agree with you, but I pointed out already this morning that there is a new currency in town: 
CO2. Historically, we as airlines complain about money and passenger comfort, which, obviously, didn't get very 
far. But now it is different. This important thing about CO2 will change the debate. But I agree we have privately to 
be tough with politicians for revoking ideas that are expensive.' 
The problem with the reforms, notably those on air space, is that national governments are unwilling to take action 
and the European Commission fails to have the power to impose an EU-wide policy. Spohr agreed: 'Where is their 
power, really? Is it just a question of willingness? The fact is that if Germany or France because of the pressure of 
the unions doesn't agree to do it, any Commissioner in the world can try but will be unsuccessful. It is nave to think 
that someone in Brussels wakes up in the morning and takes up the phone to call Paris or Berlin and tell them 'the 
Single European Sky will happen.' 
'The Commission has to drive it true, the Commission is a transnational body. The problem is we have a 
Commission that doesn't want to take action,' added O'Leary. He referred to the Commission's failure to address 
the problem of the closure of French air space for overflying traffic during the multiple strikes in recent weeks and 
days, which are set to continue in April. Ryanair has launched a petition[5] to get the flying public behind it and force 
Brussels to act. 'Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen was given a roadmap by Eurocontrol three months ago to 
prioritize overflights, but she didn't do anything. They need to take action!' 
A4E discusses its concerns and worries twice a year but has to conclude that each time little or no progress has 
been made. 'As long as it is necessary, we will tell the Commission the same thing,' O'Leary said. Spohr added: 
'This conference today is more than just pressing the EU Commission. It is the reflection event of European 
aviation, which is one of the few industries where Europe is still trading on a par with other parts of the world.'  
easyJet CEO Johan Lundgren said: 'We need to be crystal sharp on the narrative and message and there is a new 
currency. There is something about the carbon saving and sustainability agenda that we can get some wins from. I 
am talking about the air space reforms. We can be better at bringing that story and also make it clear to the public 
and consumers. It becomes technical when you talk about the air space reform, but you have to make sure that 
people understand that we could reduce emissions by ten percent but can't because we can't fly in an optimum 
way.'

Fewer people searched for UK's top airlines in March against February but the trend is still upward according to 
UBS. 
Compared to pre-Covid levels, search interest across all airlines is still up nonetheless in the UK, Spain, and France 
though Germany lags some way behind 2019 levels.
Budget airline, easyJet, saw a monthly drop off in interest in France, the UK, Italy, and Germany - only improving in 
Spain.
Even so, UK searches for the Luton-based are above pre-Covid numbers, the Swiss bank noted.
Ryanair has struggled doe searches in all five of the stated countries and is way behind pre-pandemic levels in 
Germany, UBS's research found.
Wizz Air appears to be one of the best airlines for search interest growth this year, with it outperforming pre-Covid 
levels in France, the UK, Italy, and Spain.
Both easyJet and Wizz Air have experienced strong starts to 2023 in terms of share price growth, with the two 
airlines up 48% and 42% respectively.
Ryanair has seen its share price rise grow by more than a quarter this year.
British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group's (IAG) share price has remained slightly more 
subdued, growing by around 10% in the year-to-date.

The head of budget giant Ryanair drew a line under a rare public spat with Boeing on Wednesday by confirming 
talks over potentially ordering at least 100 new jets - but insisted significant discounts would still be needed to 
unlock a deal.
 Europe's largest budget carrier halted negotiations for at least 100 Boeing 737 MAX 10 jets in a pricing dispute 
towards the end of the COVID-19 crisis some 18 months ago.
 Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on Wednesday Ryanair was now considering the 200-seat 737 MAX 8200 
and the 230-seat 737 MAX 10 "as long as the price parameters are acceptable".
 A potential deal for 100 planes, plus 100 options, is likely to take several months to negotiate, he told Reuters on 
the sidelines of an A4E airline conference in Brussels.
 Boeing shares were up 1% at mid-session in New York.
 He also said he expected the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to certify the 737 MAX 7, Boeing's smallest 
model, in the first half of 2023 and the MAX 10 to win approval from U.S. regulators towards the end of this year.
 Ryanair is one of Boeing's largest customers and is seen as one of a handful of airlines that can insist on the best 
prices in their region, alongside U.S. carrier Southwest Airlines.
 In late 2021, O'Leary accused Boeing of trying to impose a "delusionary" price increase and declared a "marital rift" 
between the Irish carrier and its long-time sole supplier.
 Boeing said at the time it valued Ryanair's business but had to exercise discipline. On Wednesday, it declined 
comment.
 Industry sources had said the breakdown was a test of two competing views on the speed of the post-COVID 
recovery, with Boeing gaining confidence from renewed sales of the MAX following a safety crisis and Ryanair 
prepared to wait it out.
Ryanair Says Price Still Key To New Boeing Jet Deal
 O'Leary told the Financial Times last week that talks had resumed. On Wednesday, O'Leary said the breakthrough 
came after Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun and Stan Deal, head of its commercial division, approached 
Ryanair two months ago.
"They are back talking to us; I think it takes maybe six, nine months to get a deal done," he added.
 The Ryanair CEO voiced support for Calhoun and said he hoped Boeing's management would stabilise "over a 
number of years", adding the company had been through a rough period of delays.
"I think Calhoun is putting together a good team and we would like to see that team stabilise over a number of 
years, and we could get back to kind of normal for doing business relations," he said.

 Ryanair [1]is in no hurry to sign a new order for more Boeing MAX aircraft. The airline and airframer are back at the 
negotiation table, but Group CEO Michael O'Leary said on the sidelines of the Airline ls 4 Europe Aviation Summit 
in Brussels on Wednesday that it could take six months to a year before an order could be signed. 
The Irish low-cost carrier walked away from negotiations after it found Boeing unwilling to discuss a significant 
discount. For months, nothing happened. Last week, The Financial Times reported that negotiations are on again. 
'They approached us some two months ago, we started those discussions. We are still at the possibility for an order 
for the MAX 8200 or the MAX 10. It could be either, I am agnostic,' O'Leary told AirInsight. 
He added: 'I would like to have more -8200s, because that's what we have. But if they want us to buy a bigger 
aircraft with thirty extra seats, I want a discount for those seats because if I fill the volume of those extra seats 
lowers my yields.' 
It seems illogical that Boeing[2] would lower the price now that the MAX has won several orders over the past 
months, including from Qatar Airways, Alaska, WestJet, United, and Japan Airlines last week, plus a few smaller 
ones. 'There is no doubt that Airbus[3] is selling more. I suspect that Boeing had so many delivery problems with 
the MAX and 787 that now that they are getting out of the way, they are back on the sales path again.' 
'I am not under any particular pressure to sign a deal. We are getting fifty aircraft in the summer of 2023, fifty in 
2024, and thirty in 2025. But I do recognize we do need more aircraft in 2026 through 2030. I have to retire some 
older aircraft, and at the same time, I want to grow.'

Tel Aviv Ben Gurin International Airport (TLV) is halting all departing flights from the airport after Israel's national 
trade union center, the Histadrut, called a general strike.
The announcement was made by the Israel Airport Authority's Board Chairman Pinchas Idan following Histadrut's 
call for a general strike across the country.
For the time being, aircraft will still be able to land at TLV.
Data from flightradar24.com shows that currently only flights departing to Germany have been canceled, which is 
also experiencing a general strike by its unions, affecting airport operations across the country.
At the same time, some flights were delayed, such as Wizz Air flight W68430 from TLV to Naples Airport (NAP) that 
was scheduled to depart at 11:05 AM local time (UTC +3) and delayed until 11:50 AM. The flight eventually 
departed at 11:44 AM.
Delta Air Lines flight DL249 from the Israeli capital to Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport (ATL) has 
been pushed back from 11:30 AM local time to 12:30 PM local time, while Ryanair flight FR5813 from TLV to Rome 
Leonardo da Vinci Fiumicino Airport (FCO) was scheduled to depart at 11:30 AM local time without doing so, per 
flightradar.com information viewed at the time of publication.
In a press conference on March 27, 2023, Arnon Bar-David, the Chairman of Histadrut, announced a general strike, 
stating that "last night, all red lines were crossed", referring to the firing of Israel's Minister of Defense, Yoav 
Gallant. Gallant was let go by Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu on March 26, 2023.
Gallant spoke out against the juridical reforms taking place in the country, arguing in a Facebook post, published 
late in the day on March 25, 2023, that a "growing rift in society penetrates the IDF [Israeli Defense Force - ed. 
note] and the security bodies" of Israel.
"For the safety of Israel, for our sons and daughters: we need to stop the legislative process at this time -allow the 
people of Israel to celebrate together Passover and Independence Day and mourn together on Memorial Day and 
Holocaust Day. These are holy days for us," the now-former Defense Minister continued.

The summer flight season is launched at Riga Airport with 11 new destinations, thus significantly expanding the 
range of connections from Riga, including a new destination - Hanover in Germany. Passengers will have an 
opportunity to travel to more than 100 direct destinations from Riga.
"In this summer season, Riga is expected to offer ample travel opportunities for Latvian and Baltic travellers and 
attractive connections for passengers who will choose Riga Airport as a transfer point for their onward flights. 
Thanks to the many tourist destinations, the number of direct passengers at Riga Airport has approached the pre-
pandemic level, whereas the number of transit passengers will increase with new airBaltic routes such as Istanbul, 
Baku, Yerevan and others," says Laila Odina, Chairperson of the Airport Board. "As we start the new season, we 
are also bringing passengers new offers, including unprecedented offers from shops and cafés. It is therefore a 
great pleasure to be recognised internationally and to start the new season as the third best airport in Eastern 
Europe in the latest airport ranking by the prestigious aviation industry rating agency Skytrax, which is based on the 
results of customer voting," says the head of the Airport.
This summer, Latvia's national carrier airBaltic will expand its range of services with ten new routes and increased 
frequencies on existing summer leisure and short break routes. From 15 April, airBaltic will fly twice weekly on the 
route Riga-Hanover-Riga - a German city to which Riga has had no direct air connection until now. The new 
schedule will also include twice-weekly flights to Porto and Bilbao from May, and four-times-weekly flights to 
Istanbul from the beginning of April. In May, regular flights will also be launched to Bucharest, Burgas, Belgrade, 
Tivat, Yerevan and Baku.
On 28 March, the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair will start flights from Riga to the northern Polish city of Gdansk. 
Flights on this route are scheduled three times a week.
The Greek airline Aegean will return to the range of airlines in Riga in the upcoming summer season as a regular 
carrier with flights on the Riga-Athens route twice a week, starting from 19 May.
Thus, 15 carriers will operate at Riga Airport in the summer season of 2023. It is planned that in the first full week of 
the summer flight schedule, the number of passenger flights will increase by more than 10 % as compared to the 
end of the winter season and will exceed 1 000 passenger flights per week.

Taking wing Ryanair sees prospect of Boeing deal

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said he was optimistic about striking a major new aircraft order after the 
low-cost airline restarted talks with Boeing in the latest sign of the revival in aviation.
O'Leary said there was a "deal to be done", with negotiations between the Irish airline and Boeing in "the early 
stages" for an order of Boeing 737 jets, 18 months after discussions collapsed over a disagreement on prices.
"We're back talking to them, which I think is an indication there is some movement on pricing ... I think there is a 
deal to be done," he added.
He said the new multibillion-dollar order could be for the 737 Max 10, the largest in the family of single-aisle aircraft, 
or for the smaller Max 8200.
The potential boost for Boeing came as its chief executive Dave Calhoun said he was optimistic the worst of the jet 
manufacturers' delivery problems were "in the rear-view mirror".
Ryanair is one of Boeing's biggest customers, and O'Leary has regularly criticised it over prices and its record in 
delivering aircraft.
O'Leary has accepted that the new planes will be more expensive than the "ridiculously low price" he paid for his 
most recent order, signed in the depths of the pandemic when the industry was virtually grounded.
Taking wing Ryanair sees prospect of Boeing deal
Ryanair ordered 75 Max 8200s in December 2020, which analysts said would have come at a "screaming" 
discount, taking total orders for it to 210. O'Leary has chided Boeing for delays in the deliveries, but said it had 
recently made "real strides" on its backlog. Philip Georgiadis, Sylvia Pfeifer and Claire Bushey

Ryanair and Boeing talks restart over long-delayed 737 shipment

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) have returned to negotiations for a new 
shipment of 737s, after talks collapsed over pricing disagreements in 2021.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said there was a "deal to be done" with Boeing for a bulk order of new 737-Max jets 
on Thursday, adding the two parties were talking again after negotiations broke down eighteen months ago.
Boeing confirmed the news, suggesting by the year-end its supply issues, and need to ask for higher prices, should 
be "in the rear-view mirror".
O'Leary hinted the multimillion-dollar deal could be for the 737 Max 10 or the smaller 8200 version, which are 
powered by LEAP-1B engines from CFM International.
Ryanair currently operates 505 aircraft in its fleet, the majority of which are variants of the Boeing 737, able to carry 
near 200 passengers, though its subsidiary Lauda Air uses Airbus A320s.
He added Boeing's willingness to talk was an "indication" it was open to "movement on pricing," which had been 
lowered as the industry struggled through the pandemic.
Liberum analysts tipped Ryanair a 'buy' following the news, offering a share price target of (EURO)17, up from 
Thursday's opening price of (EURO)14.9.
Boeing, meanwhile, has signed several orders with operators in recent weeks, including Saudi Arabia's new Riyadh 
Air and Japan Airlines.

As a result, Liberum suggested its "bargaining position may not get any weaker," adding, "this is a good time for 
Ryanair to strike a deal".

Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (LSE:RR.) is seeking to find a way into the narrow-body jets market but is set to sit by 
and watch another deal being struck between Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) and Boeing.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary confirmed the low-fare carrier was in talks with Boeing on Thursday, marking yet 
another deal Rolls-Royce will miss out on, since it is yet to find a way into the short-haul market.
Rolls-Royce supplies engines for various wide-body jets, including the Boeing 777, 787 and Airbus A330 and A380.
However, it currently offers no engines for narrow-body jets, used by short-haul carriers like Ryanair and easyJet 
PLC.
It is seeking ways into the narrow-body market, according to JP Morgan, potentially diversifying from engines which 
only power larger commercial flights.
JP Morgan suggested Rolls had "no easy route" into the narrow-body market in February, though.
Having looked to partner with other manufacturers, analysts at the bank said any near-term deals between Rolls 
and its rivals were unlikely, given the already established relationships between engine makers, such as General 
Electric (NYSE:GE) and Safran.
Rolls' is developing its new 'UltraFan' engine, which is more efficient and "scalable" for use on smaller commercial 
aircraft, but is not expected to be available until the 2030s.
Rolls-Royce shares fell 0.75% to 148p on Thursday.

Ryanair just announced it restarted talks with Boeing for a new large order for the 737-10 Max or for the smaller 
737-8 Max 200 jets. Let's take a look at the airline's fleet of 500+ jets, consisting mainly of 737s, operated by 
Ryanair, Malta Air, Lauda Europe and Buzz.
Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary there was a 'deal to be done' with negotiations between the Irish airline and 
Boeing in "the early stages" for a new order of Boeing 737 jets, during an interview with the Financial Times on 
Thursday Mar. 23.
"We are back talking to them, which I think is an indication there is some movement on pricing . . . I think there is a 
deal to be done," the report quoted O'Leary as saying. Boeing declined to comment, while Ryanair did not 
immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
Ryanair Group operates mainly Boeing 737-800 aircraft, and as of February 2023:
410 Boeing 737-800 seating 189 in economy class and operated by Ryanair, Malta Air and Buzz.
91 (+119 on order) Boeing 737-8 Max 200 seating 197 in economy class and operated by Ryanair Malta Air and 
Buzz.
1 Boeing 737-700 seating 60 in business-class layout. Used for corporate charters and training.
29 Airbus A320-200 seating 180 in economy class and operated by Lauda Europe, leases are extended to 2028.
After delays due to the grounding of the 737 Max, the first 737- 8 Max 200 was finally delivered to Ryanair on 16 
June 2021. Twelve deliveries were expected for the summer 2021 season (6 for Ryanair and 6 for Malta Air) and a 
further 50 by summer 2022.
In July 2021, it was announced that Ryanair had already handed back all of its leased 737s, which were replaced 
by incoming 737-8 Max 200 aircraft. The carrier expects to sell more of its older aircraft in the future.
In November 2022 the company announced it would have 124 Boeing 737-8 Max 200 by summer 2023, reducing 
the number of unfulfilled orders to 86 aircraft.
Fleet Analysis: Ryanair Group before the next Boeing 737 Max order
In January 2023, the first Ryanair 737-800 to be retrofitted with split scimitar winglets entered service, reducing fuel 
burn by 1.5%, and are to be fitted to all existing aircraft in the Ryanair fleet.
Ryan has 119 Boeing 737-8 Max 200 on order right now, so it is likely the new order will be for more Max 200s and 
a mix of 737-10 and-9s to replace the 29 leased Airbus 320s and the older 737-800s.

410 Boeing 737-800 seating 189 in economy class and operated by Ryanair, Malta Air and Buzz.
91 (+119 on order) Boeing 737-8 Max 200 seating 197 in economy class and operated by Ryanair Malta Air and 
Buzz.
1 Boeing 737-700 seating 60 in business-class layout. Used for corporate charters and training.
29 Airbus A320-200 seating 180 in economy class and operated by Lauda Europe, leases are extended to 2028.
After delays due to the grounding of the 737 Max, the first 737- 8 Max 200 was finally delivered to Ryanair on 16 
June 2021. Twelve deliveries were expected for the summer 2021 season (6 for Ryanair and 6 for Malta Air) and a 
further 50 by summer 2022.
In July 2021, it was announced that Ryanair had already handed back all of its leased 737s, which were replaced 
by incoming 737-8 Max 200 aircraft. The carrier expects to sell more of its older aircraft in the future.
In November 2022 the company announced it would have 124 Boeing 737-8 Max 200 by summer 2023, reducing 
the number of unfulfilled orders to 86 aircraft.
Fleet Analysis: Ryanair Group before the next Boeing 737 Max order
In January 2023, the first Ryanair 737-800 to be retrofitted with split scimitar winglets entered service, reducing fuel 
burn by 1.5%, and are to be fitted to all existing aircraft in the Ryanair fleet.
Ryan has 119 Boeing 737-8 Max 200 on order right now, so it is likely the new order will be for more Max 200s and 
a mix of 737-10 and-9s to replace the 29 leased Airbus 320s and the older 737-800s.

from our chosen partners. BGS meets our highest standards and expectations and has been delivering exceptional 
fuelling services since we first began the cooperation. We are thrilled to continue working with them and look 
forward to further strengthening our partnership."

Mar 21, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[1] is benefiting from the improvement in traffic from the pandemic-led slump. 
Measures to expand its fleet and bring down debt levels are encouraging too. 
Against this backdrop, let's look at the factors that make this stock an attractive pick. What Makes RYAAY an 
Attractive Pick? An Outperformer: A glimpse at the company's price trend reveals that the stock has had an 
impressive run on the bourse over the past six months. Shares of RYAAY have gained 38.7% over the past six 
months compared with the 6% rise of the industry[2] it belongs to.

Solid Zacks Rank: RYAAY has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank 
#1 or 2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities. Thus, the company is a compelling investment proposition at 
the moment. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.[3] 
Northward Estimate Revisions: The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to 
the price of a stock. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for RYAAY's 2023 and 2024 earnings 
has moved up 20.8% and 15.6%, year over year, respectively. 
Positive Earnings Surprise History: RYAAY has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company delivered an 
earnings surprise of 7.51% in the last four quarters, on average.

2024, RYAAY's earnings are expected to grow more than 100% and 1.93% year over year, respectively. 
Growth Factors: An improvement in Ryanair's traffic from the pandemic-led slump is encouraging. In February 
2023, RYAAY flew 10.6 million passengers, higher than the 8.7 million flown a year ago. The load factor (% of seats 
filled by passengers) was 92% in February 2023 compared with 86% a year ago. 
Ryanair now aims to increase its traffic in fiscal 2023 to 168 million, indicating 13% growth from the pre-COVID 
traffic numbers. The prior view was 165 million. Riding on the buoyant traffic scenario, RYAAY lifted its forecast for 
fiscal 2023 profitability. 
Measures to expand its fleet to cater to the improvement in travel demand are encouraging. In fiscal 2022, the 
airline took delivery of 61 B737-8200 jets. It expects to have more than 70 of these jets in its fleet for the peak 
summer season. The remaining jets are expected to be delivered by the end of fiscal 2025. Efforts to bring down 
debt levels are encouraging too. Other Stocks to Consider Some other top-ranked stocks from the broader

A Ryanair flight with 190 passengers was evacuated after a bomb scare onboard the aircraft.
The Boeing 737 MAX 8 arrived at Palermo Airport (PMO), in Sicily, Italy, shortly after 8pm on March 17, 2023, 
where passengers and crew were instructed to leave the plane.
According to reports the alarm was raised as the plane came into land after departing from Milan Malpensa Airport 
(MXP) earlier that evening.
Emergency services and bomb specialists rushed to the scene and the airspace around the airport was promptly 
closed.
A number of flights from Milan, Florence and Budapest were diverted to Sicily's other major airport, Catania-
Fontanarossa (CTA).
After bomb experts inspected the plane, the incident was given the all clear and the airport was able to accept 
flights again.
Local media suggested that concerns centered around a suspicious suitcase on the plane.
The company that manages the Falcone e Borsellino airport tweeted: "The following flights were diverted to Catania 
airport: VY6922/6923 FLR/PMO/FLR 20:55 to 21:40; AZ1793/1790 LIN/PMO/LIN 20.35 - 21.20 FR2020/2021 
BUD/PMO/BUD 20.50 - 21.15".
This is the second bomb scare in March 2023. Earlier in the month a note was found in the bathroom of a mid-air 
United Airlines flight reportedly making a threat that there was a device on board the plane.
AeroTime has contacted Ryanair for comment regarding the Palermo Airport incident.

Ryanair has had enough of continuous French ATC strikes

 Irish low-cost airlineRyanair[1] is trying to get one million people to sign a petition to force the European 
Commission to take action against France and the countless strikes at air traffic control (ATC). The airline is fed up 
with the strikes, which are seriously disrupting air travel across Europe. Even today, French ATC is on strike to 
protest the pension reforms that have been imposed by President Macron. Ryanair has had enough of continuous 
French ATC strikes. 
Ryanair's CEO Eddie Wilson said at a media conference in Brussels that this year, French ATC strikes have 
disrupted air travel for thirteen days in the last eight weeks. Another four have been announced for this week, 
including the one today. 'In thirteen days of ATC strikes, over a million of our passengers have been affected 
unnecessarily, 300 Ryanair flights had to be canceled and another 6.000 suffered delays, much to the frustration of 
our customers.' 
The problem is that the French strike affects overflying traffic, while domestic flights are protected and can continue. 
'Overflights are allowed in many other countries, but not in France. So while we are bearing the consequences of 
the strike in Dublin, Berlin, Madrid, or wherever, French flights are protected. That's outrageous and the European 
Commission needs to do something about it,' said Wilson. 
Eighty percent of the flights that are affected by strikes are flights crossing France. Hit the hardest in the past eight 
weeks were those to Spain, with 1.750 flights and 320.000 passengers. The UK is next with 700 flights and 120.000 
passengers, with Italy in third place with 600 flights and 115.000 affected customers. When not canceled, flights 
had to make long detours to circumvent French airspace instead of taking the direct and shorter route. This has 
cost 1.1 million kilograms in extra fuel and resulted in 4.000 tonnes in carbon dioxide emissions. 
https://i0.wp.com/airinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-03-20-1.png?ssl=1 
'If they are on strike in France over pension reforms, why should that affect people in Germany, Italy or Spain? 
They have the right to strike, but not the right to needlessly disrupt people's business or holidays. This denies 
people the freedom of movement, one of the four freedoms within the European Union, but the Commission has 
done nothing about this. If this was happening at ports or roads, it would be sorted out straight away,' Wilson 
said.Punctuality in Europe[2] already suffered in 2022 because of airline, airport, and ATC disruptions. 
What annoys Ryanair the most is that the French way of striking is different from the rest of Europe. 'The Spanish, 
Italians, and Greek agreed that when their ATC goes on strike, they allow overflying traffic to continue. That 
Ryanair has had enough of continuous French ATC strikes
happened in Greece last Friday and it can be done in France too. We need Eurocontrol to manage ATC when the 
French go on strike. It is important that France mandates overflights so Eurocontrol can take over, and a mandate 
for arbitration instead of going on strike.' Director of Operations Neal McMahon said that in September, only nine 
ATC staff went on strike but caused chaos across the European system. 
Instead of having lobby organization Airlines 4 Europe running a campaign, Ryanair calls upon the flying public to 
protest against the problem, although Wilson said that other airlines are welcome to join. 'easyJet is affected, all the 
Spanish airlines flying North are affected.' Once one million people have signed the 'Keep EU skies open'-petition, 
Ryanair intends to present the signatures to Ursula von der Leyen, Chair of the European Commission. 
'We have been calling on Von der Leyen for many months now but nothing has happened. Now we are facing a 
summer of chaos just because of a local dispute about the retirement age. I would love to bring the French air traffic 
controllers of President Von der Leyen to the middle of an airport where there are 20.000 people, sitting around on 
the floors because they can't take off from a country unrelated to what is happening in France.'

Passengers are owed £4.5mln from just six airlines in the UK based on outstanding court claims, according to 
consumer researcher Which?, with over half of this owed by Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ).
British Airways, Tui AG, easyJet PLC, Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) and Jet2 PLC (AIM:JET2) also owe 
passengers money, with the six collectively facing thousands of outstanding judgements, which show no record of 
having been paid.
How much airlines owe:
  
•
Wizz Air - £2.2mln in 1,601 judgements  
•
Tui Airways - £1.3mln in 313 judgements  
•
easyJet - £0.6mln in 884 judgements  
•
Ryanair - £0.55mln in 840 judgements  
•
British Airways - £96,042 from 82 judgements  
•
Jet 2 - £1,434 from 4 judgements
"Nobody should have to fight their airline in court for a refund, expenses or compensation," Which said, slating the 
Civil Aviation Authority's dispute resolution scheme for not doing enough.
The consumer association explained that passengers were entitled to refunds and expenses if flights were 
cancelled or delayed under UK law and could do so through the CAA's AviationADR scheme, introduced in 2016.
Cases have clogged up the courts though, Which claimed, with the scheme was also found to have "failed" 
customers who were entitled to money back.
Wizz Air , easyJet and Tui among airlines told to pay customers millions
Commenting on the unpaid claims, Wizz air passenger Russel Quirk suggested airlines were attempting to 
"Stonewall" customers in order to make them give up on trying to reclaim money.
Wizz Air gained the title of the UK's worst short-haul airline, as shown by a Which? customer survey, scoring a 48% 
customer satisfaction score, below Ryanair at 52% and British Airways at 56%.

For St. Patrick s Day, you might crack open a Guinness brewed by . If that inspires you to investigate how Irish 
stocks may fit into your portfolio, you have quite a few to choose from.  
We ll review a few top performers listed on major U.S. exchanges. 
While Guinness is one of the most prominent products of Ireland, there are several U.S.-listed Irish stocks worth 
celebrating as the world devotes a day to Irish culture. Diageo is based in the U.K., which is not always a selling 
point among true Ireland aficionados.  
It s possible to buy a basket of Irish stocks by using the 
This ETF is pegged to an index of companies based in Ireland. Many of these stocks are only available in the U.S. 
over the counter, but a few are listed as American depositary receipts on major exchanges, such as the Nasdaq or 
NYSE.  
The Irish stock index is outperforming the S&P 500, with a year-to-date gain of 12.22%, versus the S&P 500 s 2023 
return of 1.79%.

Should You Bring The Luck Of The Irish To Your Investmets?
In general, it s best to zero in on stocks available on the major exchanges, but in the list above, there may be a 
couple of cases where you may want to consider a stock available over the counter. Flutter Entertainment
You ve probably never heard of this over-the-counter-listed company, but you re almost certainly familiar with one 
of its properties, FanDuel. Flutter operates a range of online and in-person sports books  throughout the globe. In its 
most recent earnings report, the company cited growth in the U.S. as a key revenue driver. 
Flutter is considering listing its stock on a major U.S. exchange, which would be a boon in terms of raising capital. 
Industry analysts say that would be a shakeup to the U.S. publicly traded gaming industry because it would mean 
the entry of a huge global player.  CRH
This is yet another unfamiliar name, but CRH is a prominent manufacturer of building materials, with locations 
throughout the globe, including the U.S.  
The NYSE-listed stock has a market cap of $37.53 billion; if it were based in the U.S., it would be an S&P 500 
component. Its chart  looks good right now, as the stock is getting 50-day support after pulling back from a February 
breakout and subsequent rally.  
Revenue and earnings have slowed recently, but Wall Street expects a 1% increase in profit this year, to $3.78 a 
share. Next year, that s seen rising another 11%.  Ryanair
You could consider Ryanair the Southwest Airlines of Europe, although Southwest is more profitable due to U.S. 
pricing. Ryanair is known for efficiency and avoided holiday-season meltdowns like its U.S. counterpart. 
Ryanair  began forming a consolidation in February. It s corrected 13% so far from peak to trough. Shares got 
slammed the week of March 13, along with the broader market, but the stock s prognosis is good.  
It s currently outperforming all the major U.S. carriers when it comes to price appreciation.  
MarketBeat analyst data  show a  moderate-buy  rating, with a price target of $111, an upside of 25.44%.  
Revenue growth has been slower in recent quarters, although in 2022, the comparisons over 2021 were easy. Wall 
Street expects Ryanair to earn $7.74 a share this year, up from a loss of $0.75 a share in 2022. Next year that s 
seen rising by 1% to $7.79 a share.  Global Diversification
While it s a great idea to diversify globally, be sure that your holdings have a specific role in your portfolio. At this 
juncture, the Irish EIRL ETF can potentially boost a return above what you see with the S&P 500. A big chunk of 
that is due to the strong performance of CRH, which comprises 15.5% of the ETF.

Mar 17, 2023( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Airlines including Wizz Air and Ryanair owe millions of pounds to passengers from unpaid refunds and expenses, 
according to an investigation by the consumer group Which?. 
It called on the government and regulators to take urgent action over the 4.5m it calculates carriers owe in county 
court judgments (CCJs), describing the current enforcement of air passenger protections as 'fundamentally flawed'. 
Which? criticised 'weak regulations' and a 'dysfunctional dispute resolution system' for failing to help passengers 
enforce their rights. 
Consumers can pursue payments through county courts if they believe that an airline has failed to meet their legal 
obligations. CCJs can then be issued to the company requiring them to pay the passenger. 
Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said: 'The scale of court judgments piling up against major 
airlines is a result of a system where the odds are stacked against passengers and airlines feel empowered to 
routinely ignore their legal obligations to pay out refunds and compensation.' 
Wizz Air accounts for almost half of the total amount owed, according to the consumer group's analysis of the 
Registry Trust, a log of court documents and fines in England and Wales. 
In December, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) raised 'significant concerns' with Wizz Air over its high numbers of 
complaints and delays in paying passengers what they are owed. The airline blamed the 'unprecedented level of 
disruption' during the pandemic and said it was 'putting measures in place to ensure we are better prepared, 
including more customer services resources and revised processes'. 
It has settled more than 400 CCJs since December, it said, adding that the outstanding cases were mostly related 
to not receiving judgments from courts 'due to problems receiving post'. 
A spokesperson said: 'Online registers do not provide us with the information required to settle a case. We must, 
therefore, write to individual courts to apply for information about each case when we are made aware of it, and 
then wait to receive that information. This all makes for a complicated and time-consuming process. 
'We are taking this matter extremely seriously, doing all we can to fix these issues and settle all outstanding cases 
as quickly as possible. Customers can contact us directly using our website or app to provide information about an 
outstanding judgment.' 
Which? called on the CAA to be more 'transparent about its enforcement activities'. 
UK passengers owed millions by airlines in unpaid refunds and expenses
Anna Bowles, head of consumer policy and enforcement at the CAA, said: 'Airline passengers should rightfully 
expect to be treated fairly by airlines, and to have their complaints and claims resolved in a quick and efficient 
manner. 
'We're already reviewing Wizz Air's performance and have expressed significant concern with them over high 
volumes of complaints and delays in paying passengers what they are owed, and made clear that it is not providing 
an acceptable level of service.' 
She added: 'Our latest data on airline complaints will be published shortly, along with any further steps we plan to 
take if service has not improved.' 
The Registry Trust dataset shows that Ryanair has 840 outstanding CCJs, totalling 549,892, and Tui Airways has 
yet to settle 313 CCJs, worth 1.26m. British Airways has 82 outstanding CCJs adding up to 96,042 while Jet2 has

 Sam Jones, the founder of Gener8, a London based company that lets people take back control and earn from 
their online data, has launched a mobile app that allows people to see what data a company holds on them, then 
gives them the choice to earn from it themselves. 
In academia and government there has been a concept called PIMS (personal information management systems). 
This is essentially the idea that in the future there will be systems created that enable people to centralise their data 
into one location. Gener8 is now doing that today. 
Gener8's founder, Sam Jones, commented: 'We believe Gener8 is the first company in the world to enable people 
to centralise their data into one location and earn from it. We've built something that, until now, has only been 
theoretical in the world of academia. Think about it. Isn't it crazy that we don't even know which companies buy and 
sell our data?' 
'In fact, we don't even know what data company's hold on us. What do Facebook and Google know about you? 
Why do spam emails keep landing in your inbox? Well, with the Gener8 app you can connect to different apps and 
we'll show the data that these apps hold on you. 
'So, if for example you connect to Google, we can show you all the data that Google holds on you - every search 
you've ever made, every YouTube video you've watched, every ad that you've clicked on. It's mind boggling. We 
can then enable you to delete this data from Google. Or should you choose, you can anonymise your data and can 
earn from it.' 
Gener8 has also closed a 5.1m funding round. The investment values the company at 30m. A consortium of 
investors participated in the round, including ex-cricket captain of the West Indies, Chris Gayle, former chief 
executive of the British Olympic Association, Simon Clegg CBE and Shane Ryan, son of RyanAir founder, Tony 
Ryan. 
They join musician Tinie Tempah, football manager Harry Redknapp, and Dragons' Den stars Peter Jones, Touker 
Suleyman and Tej Lalvani who have also invested in the company. 
Sam said: 'It's been a crazy 18 months, and what a way to kick off 2023! We're building technology at Gener8 that 
has the ability to change an industry. It's mad that so many companies are making money from our data, except us! 
This has to change. 
London based data platform surpasses 5m investment via Dragons' Den stars and more
'I believe that in the same way we trust banks to keep our money safe and put it to work for us, there will be 
companies that we put our faith in to keep our data safe and even help us earn from it. Gener8 is creating this 
future. 
'As part of this fundraise we've brought onboard some fantastic investors with a wealth of expertise. I'm looking 
forward to working with them as we grow the business and execute on our mission.'

BARRY Geraghty rode some of the Cheltenham Festival greats in the shape of Sprinter Sacre, Moscow Flyer and 
Simonsig, and many believed we might have another on our hands in Facile Vega. However, a below-par run at 
Leopardstown last time has dampened enthusiasm about the Supreme Novices' Hurdle favourite and Geraghty will 
be taking him on in the Festival opener.
"They should have been dropping him in and because they haven't, they've been left with a dilemma," Geraghty 
said. "Will he settle? I'm not so sure."
A winner of 43 Festival races, Geraghty would surely have loved to have ridden Champion Hurdle favourite 
Constitution
Hill, a horse he bought as a foal, and like most of us, he can only see one result in tomorrow's feature.
"I'm very proud of what he's achieved. To go and see what's he done, particularly last season in the Supreme, has 
been great," Geraghty added. "He's been brilliant this season and if he reproduces that level of form, he's going to 
win and win well."
Ireland have dominated the four days in recent years, and while Constitution Hill is one Geraghty expects to go in 
for the home team, he's anticipating plenty of Irish success over the four days, notably Sir Gerhard in the Brown 
Advisory Novices' Chase.
"The class horse in the race is Sir Gerhard. He won the bumper and the Ballymore and I'm very very sweet on him. 
He's the best value bet of the week."
Geraghty was also keen on the chances of Teahupoo in the Stayers' Hurdle, while Appreciate It represents "big 
value" in the Turners Novices' Chase earlier on Thursday's card.
Geraghty: I'm Sir-tain there's a big run in Gerhard
The Irishman won the 2013 Gold Cup with the favourite in Bobs Worth and he expects this year's market leader, 
Galopin Des Champs, to be "very very hard to beat."

 APEXX Global, a startup that provides merchants with alternative payment options, has raised $25m (20.8m) in a 
Series B funding round. 
APEXX pitches itself as a one-stop shop for merchants looking to incorporate alternative payment options in their 
services. The company connects sellers with various payment options, including buy now pay later (BNPL) 
products, allowing them to add different payment types at checkout. 
'Since day one we've been laser-focused on our mission to build the world's leading payment orchestration platform 
and deliver clear benefits to merchants,' said Peter Keenan, co-founder and CEO of APEXX Global. 
'We've seen strong growth across international markets, delivering significant cost savings and transaction 
conversion benefits. We look forward to using these funds to further consolidate our position in driving the future of 
global payments.' 
Now armed with new funding, the London-based company is looking to expand its reach into North America through 
its New York office. APEXX will also look to add more payment types to its offering. 
The Series B round came from existing investor MMC Ventures, along with Alliance Ventures and Forward 
Partners. 
'APEXX has achieved an inflection point, demonstrating its ability to win and expand large enterprise customer 
accounts, including CarTrawler, Ryanair, AVON Cosmetics and XE.Com,' said Alan Morgan, chairman and co-
founder of MMC Ventures. 
'We've seen good momentum in terms of customer growth, and we are delighted to continue to back Peter and his 
talented team as they work with merchants to rethink payments and save money.' 
The company previously raised $8m (6.6m)[1] for its Series A round back in June 2020.

The new summer flight schedule will soon take effect at Vienna Airport. Travellers can choose among a large 
number of European and Mediterranean destinations, and longhaul flights are also staging a comeback. Austrian 
Airlines is offering flight service to 124 destinations, including new ones such as Porto, Marseille, Billund, Tivat and 
is once again flying non-stop to Los Angeles and Tokyo. Ryanair has added Helsinki, Copenhagen and Tuzla to its 
flight offering from Vienna for the first time. A total of 39 destinations including new ones such as Bilbao, Kuwait City 
and Hurghada can now be
reached with Wizz Air, and the airline will station a sixth aircraft in Vienna starting in mid-June. Air India has 
resumed flight service to Delhi and Air Canada, Air China, China Airlines, Ethiopian Airlines and Korean Air are 
increasing their flight connections. A new carrier, namely Azerbaijan Airlines, will be offering flights from Vienna, 
and Air Algerie and Condor are represented at Vienna Airport once again. The 2023 summer flight schedule is valid 
from 26 March to 20 October 2023.
"People want to travel and there is plenty of opportunity at Vienna Airport to do so: 190
destinations, new airlines and long-haul is picking up again. In the summer months, the seating capacities offered 
will equal about 90% of the pre-crisis level. High quality service is also a top priority this summer. We want to 
continue to be among the best when it comes to the most punctual flight hubs in Europe. For this reason, we are 
hiring 350 additional employees for passenger-related services. In 2022 we were the third most punctual and in 
January even the second-best hub in Europe. We would like to defend this position in the future as well," states 
Julian Jäger, Joint CEO and COO of Vienna Airport.
Austrian Airlines flies to 124 destinations, including Porto, Marseille, Billund and Tivat
Austria's home carrier will fly to 124 destinations in the summer season and has added seven new destinations to 
its flight offering i.e., Porto, Marseille, Billund, Tivat, Palermo, Vilnius and Tromsø. Austrian Airlines is offering flights 
to more than 40 destinations for sunseekers and close to 300 weekly flights to the Mediterranean region. An 
extensive offering of long-haul flights is also available in the summer months. For example, the airline is once again 
flying non-stop to Los Angeles and Tokyo, whereas flights to Chicago, New York, Washington, Montreal, Shanghai 
and Bangkok are available throughout the year.
Ryanair serves 75 destinations from Vienna with a fleet of 19 aircraft
Strong summer flight schedule at Vienna Airport with 190 destinations
The Irish airline will offer more than 80 weekly flights in the summer flight schedule, comprising a 10% increase in 
the number of flights operated from Vienna. For example, it has launched flight service to Copenhagen, Helsinki 
and Tuzla from Vienna Airport. It is increasing frequencies to more than 30 sunny and city destinations such as 
Barcelona, Ibiza, Milan, Rome and Venice. Ryanair is stationing a total of 19 aircraft in Vienna.
Wizz Air flies to 39 destinations and stations a sixth aircraft in Vienna
As of mid-June, WIZZ will operate six state-of-the-art A321neo aircraft from Vienna Airport,
and in the course of the summer will offer flights to Bilbao, Kuwait City and Hurghada for the first time. In recent 
months, the airline has strongly expanded towards the East and has
launched flight service on the following routes: Riad, Dammam, Jeddah, Abu Dhabi, Dubai,
Yerevan, Gatwick, Kukes, Madeira and Eilat. In the summer season Wizz Air will also offer
flights to Sharm El Sheikh, Chania, Corfu, Zakynthos, Dubrovnik and Split. On balance, Wizz
Air will operate flights from Austria to 39 destinations in 26 countries this summer.
New to Vienna Airport: Azerbaijan Airlines serves Baku and Air Cairo flies to Marsa Alam
Starting in the middle of May, Vienna Airport will boast a new airline partner. Azerbaijan Airlines will operate flights 
twice per week between Azerbaijan's capital city of Baku and Vienna. Air Cairo will launch a new flight connection 
to Marsa Alam, and Air Algerie will once again offer flights to Algiers in Algeria. In the summer months passengers 
will be able to reach the popular holiday islands of Mallorca, Keta and Rhodes with Condor.
More long-haul flights depart from Vienna
India's national airline has returned to Vienna following a break of close to three years due to the coronavirus 
pandemic. Since February Air India has operated direct flights between Vienna and Delhi. The flight connection is 
being served three times per week. Airlines are also increasing their flight frequencies on existing routes, for 
example Air Canada to Toronto, Air China to Beijing, China Airlines to Taipei, Ethiopian Airlines to Addis Abeba and 
Korean Air to Seoul.

Highlight: Flights across various UK airports were delayed or cancelled as heavy snowfall prompted by an Arctic 
blast caused disruptions.
Body
Heathrow, Gatwick and London City were among the airports whose aircraft movement was hit with the cold snap, 
according to Express news. UK's Met Office has issued a warning that the condition could get even worse as it 
expects more snowfall. 
Arrivals board of Gatwick Airport showed that the majority of the flights were delayed or cancelled due to snow. 
Heathrow, which is said to be one of the biggest international airports in the country, has also cancelled nearly 25 
arrival flights, according to the news publication. Besides, flight disruptions were reported at Bristol Airport, with the 
airport authorities warning passengers of delays due to the yellow weather warning across the South West region, 
The Independent reported. In a statement posted on its Twitter account, the airport said: "The Bristol Airport teams 
are working hard on snow clearing operations, but as the snow continues to fall, flight operations have been 
suspended until 1100. "Passengers are advised to contact their airline for specific flight information prior to 
travelling to the airport and please take extra care. Bristol airport serves as the southwest hub for airliners including 
easyJet, Jet2.com, Ryanair and TUI Airways. A spokesperson for the airport told The Independent: "Snow across 
the UK has caused disruption to a number of flights at Bristol Airport. Additional staff are on-site to assist with the 
adverse weather response. "It is a rapidly changing situation and passengers are advised to check with their airline 
prior to making their way to the airport, as some airlines have made proactive cancellations to their flight 
programme for the remainder of the day."

THIS time next week millions of Brits will be preparing to tune in to Super Saturday, the three games of the final 
round of the Six Nations. This year's finale sees Scotland host Italy before Wales travel to France, with Ireland's 
match against England closing the show.
Here's how to be there, based on two people travelling on Friday and returning to London on Sunday.
SCOTLAND VS ITALY EasyJet can take you from Stansted to Edinburgh for £121 per person, or from Luton for 
£101 - the cheapest option at the time of writing. A train will take nearly five hours and cost £155 in economy or 
over £300 in first www.class.No question, really, is there?
Britannia Edinburgh Hotel is the most cost effective stay at £228 (£57 per person per night) while Booking.com's top 
reviewed offering is BrewDog's DogHouse - that'll set you back £710 for the weekend.
The match itself is currently a sellout given how well Scotland are playing, but official resale sites have a handful of 
tickets remaining. Murrayfield is still taking hospitality enquiries but you'll need to be quick - prices are available 
upon request. FRANCE VS WALES Flying from Luton to Charles de Gaulle via EasyJet and returning from Paris 
Orly to Gatwick on Vueling costs just £111, while a return to Orly from Gatwick with Vueling is £191. The Eurostar 
will set you back £189 in economy and £275 in business premier.
So you want to go to watch the Six Nations? Now is the time to secure your spot at next week's Super 
Saturday. Matt Hardy walks you through how to do it
The Auberge de Jeunesse HI Paris Le d'Artagnan is the cheapest place to be in the French capital at £139. The 
Hotel des Arts Montmartre is the best rated on www.Booking.com at £559, or £139 per person per night. Paris isn't 
exactly short of hotels, however.
Like Murrayfield, the Stade de France is already packed to the rafters for Super Saturday with only official resale 
sites likely to have tickets available next week. It is still, however, offering hospitality for the match. While the VIP 
cocktail lounge is sold out, VIP seated lounges are available for £711 per person, the VIP Club Lounge can be 
accessed for £800 and private boxes are available from about £10,500. IRELAND VS ENGLAND A horribly early 
flight from Stansted with Ryanair paired with an awfully late return will set you back just £77, with many offers below 
the £100 mark. A more leisurely Friday evening flight combined with the same 10pm return is just £70. If you're 
feeling ambitious and want to drive, a ferry crossing from Holyhead in north Wales to Dublin will set you back £286.
Dublin is famously overpriced on a Six Nations weekend. The Green in Saint Stephen's Green is the cheapest 
offering at £802, while the highest rated hotel on www.Booking.com is the Herbert Park Hotel and Park Residence 
which will set you back £1,189.
Like the other two, normal tickets for this potential title decider are currently unavailable.
That said, there are likely to be some on resale from Monday.
So Super Saturday is upon us soon, and three great cities are hosting huge rugby clashes.
As always, let us know if you use our tips and attend.

JetSMART ready to enter the Colombian domestic market

JetSMART is in the process of obtaining an air operator certificate (AOC) from the Colombian aviation authority, 
Aerocivil.
The move comes in the wake of the demise of the country's main budget carrier, Viva Air, which stopped flying in 
February 2023.
JetSMART had been one of the bidders for Viva Air's business, when its owners, Irelandia Aviation (a firm 
controlled by the Ryan family, of Ryanair fame) put the ailing business up for sale. Another local competitor, 
Avianca, finally agreed to acquire Viva Air, but the competition authorities' reluctance to approve the deal led to the 
suspension of all of Viva Air's flights and left thousands of travelers stranded across Colombia.
JetSMART has been operating in Colombia since 2019, although only on international routes linking some 
Colombian airports to destinations in its home country of Chile.
Back in November 2022, JetSMART applied to establish a subsidiary in Colombia and begin operating in the 
domestic market. The carrier's plan envisaged a base for 12 A320 family aircraft at Bogotá's El Dorado International 
Airport (BOG) and the operation of 111 routes across the country.
The Colombian authorities decided to postpone the decision in late December 2022, after hearing allegations from 
other interested parties. The regulator alleged they needed to compile more information and expressed doubts that 
the capacity of the applicant to fulfil the suggested flight program.
This decision has reportedly been reversed, although it appears that out of 111 routes requested, only 27 will be 
approved.
While this process was ongoing, JetSMART had also applied for its Peruvian subsidiary to operate 12 international 
routes between Colombia and different cities in Peru.
Based in Santiago de Chile and with subsidiaries also in Argentina and Peru, JetSMART is part of the portfolio of 
airlines belonging to investment group Indigo Partners, which also controls Wizz Air in Europe, Volaris in Mexico, 
Frontier Airlines in the United States, and Cebu Pacific in the Philippines.

Air Horizont (HT, Zaragoza) will base a single B737-400 out of Bratislava airport to operate summer leisure charters

Under a deal arranged by charter broker Classic Air, the aircraft will operate nearly 200 rotations between June 13 
and September 21, 2023, connecting Bratislava with destinations in Italy, Greece, and Spain. The charter contract 
is worth over EUR7.4 million euros (USD7.9 million).
The ch-aviation fleets advanced module shows that Air Horizont's fleet consists of five B737-400s. The airline also 
leases out another unit of the type to Bulgaria's GP Aviation (IV, Sofia). Only one of the Boeing aircraft is currently 
active, operating charter flights mainly in Air Horizont's home market, Spain.
Bratislava is currently a base for Buzz (Poland) (operating for parent Ryanair) and ACMI/charter specialists Air 
Explore, Go2Sky, and Smartwings (Czechia)/Smartwings (Slovakia).

JetBlue deal for Spirit hit by lawsuit Airlines US authorities say move means higher prices and fewer customer

JetBlue deal for Spirit hit by lawsuit; Airlines US authorities say move means

US authorities and states have sued to block JetBlue Airways' proposed $3.8bn acquisition of Spirit Airlines on the 
basis that it would reduce competition in the passenger aviation industry.
The US Department of Justice, the District of Columbia and the states of New York and Massachusetts filed an 
antitrust lawsuit yesterday arguing that the deal would "eliminate" competition from Spirit, the fast-growing low-cost 
carrier, leading to higher prices and fewer options for customers.
The lawsuit comes after JetBlue prevailed in a bidding war with Frontier Airlines to acquire Spirit last July.
Spirit and Frontier had previously warned that a deal with JetBlue would encounter pushback from competition 
regulators.
"This acquisition would combine two especially close and fierce head-to-head competitors," the plaintiffs said in a 
court filing. "On dozens of routes serving tens of millions of passengers each year, JetBlue and Spirit are two of the 
most significant rivals today, and they have such large combined market shares that the transaction is 
presumptively illegal."
JetBlue deal for Spirit hit by lawsuit Airlines US authorities say move means higher prices and fewer customer 
options
JetBlue and Spirit said they would "continue to advance" their merger plans in spite of the lawsuit. "Customers 
deserve a competitive airline marketplace and we will pursue this merger to ensure they get it," said Robin Hayes, 
JetBlue chief executive.
The combined company would create the fifth-largest US airline and the deal represented the latest consolidation in 
an industry that has seen a series of megamergers over the past 15 years. Hayes argued the combination with 
Spirit would create a new rival to the industry's traditional Big Four - American, United, Delta and Southwest - and 
help cut fares by "disrupting" pricing.
The four main US carriers and their regional affiliates control 80 per cent of routes in the US, while JetBlue 
estimated that the combination with Spirit would control about 9 per cent of the market.
JetBlue is involved in a separate antitrust lawsuit in which US authorities and states are seeking to block a set of 
agreements with American that would consolidate the companies' operations in Boston and New York. Merrick 
Garland, US attorney-general, said the JetBlue-Spirit transaction would "exacerbate problems caused by that 
alliance," but the proposed acquisition would have still violated US antitrust laws without the agreement with 
American.
Analysts said that a tie-up between Frontier and Spirit would have an easier pathway to regulatory approval, but 
saw greater potential benefits to a JetBlue-Spirit deal.
The main US airlines were some of the few to be consistently profitable in the years leading up to the pandemic. 
Some analysts and executives expect the industry in Europe to follow the US with mergers as the impact of 
coronavirus fades. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary is among them, and has long projected that the 
European industry will shrink to a handful of big players.

deserve a competitive airline marketplace and we will pursue this merger to ensure they get it," said Robin Hayes, 
JetBlue chief executive.
The combined company would create the fifth-largest US airline and the deal represented the latest consolidation in 
an industry that has seen a series of megamergers over the past 15 years. Hayes argued the combination with 
Spirit would create a new rival to the industry's traditional Big Four - American, United, Delta and Southwest - and 
help cut fares by "disrupting" pricing.
The four main US carriers and their regional affiliates control 80 per cent of routes in the US, while JetBlue 
estimated that the combination with Spirit would control about 9 per cent of the market.
JetBlue is involved in a separate antitrust lawsuit in which US authorities and states are seeking to block a set of 
agreements with American that would consolidate the companies' operations in Boston and New York. Merrick 
Garland, US attorney-general, said the JetBlue-Spirit transaction would "exacerbate problems caused by that 
alliance," but the proposed acquisition would have still violated US antitrust laws without the agreement with 
American.
Analysts said that a tie-up between Frontier and Spirit would have an easier pathway to regulatory approval, but 
saw greater potential benefits to a JetBlue-Spirit deal.
The main US airlines were some of the few to be consistently profitable in the years leading up to the pandemic. 
Some analysts and executives expect the industry in Europe to follow the US with mergers as the impact of 
coronavirus fades. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary is among them, and has long projected that the 
European industry will shrink to a handful of big players.

US authorities and states have sued to block JetBlue Airways' proposed $3.8bn acquisition of Spirit Airlines on the 
basis that it would reduce competition in the passenger aviation industry.
The US Department of Justice, the District of Columbia and the states of New York and Massachusetts filed an 
antitrust lawsuit yesterday arguing that the deal would "eliminate" competition from Spirit, the fast-growing low-cost 
carrier, leading to higher prices and fewer options for customers.
The lawsuit comes after JetBlue prevailed in a bidding war with Frontier Airlines to acquire Spirit last July.
Spirit and Frontier had previously warned that a deal with JetBlue would encounter pushback from competition 
regulators.
"This acquisition would combine two especially close and fierce head-to-head competitors," the plaintiffs said in a 
court filing. "On dozens of routes serving tens of millions of passengers each year, JetBlue and Spirit are two of the 
most significant rivals today, and they have such large combined market shares that the transaction is 
presumptively illegal."

Mar 07, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; 
 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - March 7, 2023 - Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights United 
Airlines UAL[1], American Airlines AAL[2], Southwest Airlines LUV[3], Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] and Copa 
Airlines CPA[5]. Breaking Down 3 Airline Segments (Avoid 1)The Resurgence of Air Travel Since the COVID-19 
fallout in 2020, airlines have been on the runway to recovery. In 2022, air traffic numbers finally recovered fully to 
2019 pre-pandemic numbers, according to the FAA. Thus far in March, TSA checkpoint numbers are showing 2023 
not only surpassing 2022, but also taking out 2019 numbers. As more employees enjoy flexible remote work, 
business travel recovers, and vacationers make up for lost time, the airline industry's turbulent times may be in the 
rearview mirror, and years of growth may be ahead. With that said, not all airlines are created equally. Today, we 
will break down three segments of the airline industry: Large Domestic Carriers In January, Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) 
United Airlines handily beat earnings estimates. Zacks Consensus Estimates expected EPS of 2.07, and UAL 
delivered EPS of $2.46. 
UAL's revenue also jumped by a healthy 51% as air traffic picked up. UAL's healthy top-line growth can also be 
attributed to its fast growing cargo operations business. Cargo revenues increased an impressive 84.1% in 2022 
versus pre pandemic levels. 
Judging by UAL's historical earnings price and earnings relationship, the stock has a lot left in the tank. If UAL's 
earnings trajectory follows consensus estimates for the next year, a conservative price target would be $80 a share 
by year-end based on the chart below: 
Fellow Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock American Airlines is on a similar growth path as United. Like United, American 
Airlines benefits from the continued recovery in air travel demand, a growing offering of travel destinations, and 
management's debt reduction efforts. However, from an estimate perspective, UAL remains the most attractive 
name in this segment. Small Domestic Carriers Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) Southwest Airlines has been 
drastically underperforming its peers. While United Airlines is up 70% over the past year, Southwest's stock is lower 
by 8%. 
Southwest's performance has been negatively impacted by rising fuel costs, massive flight cancellations, and a rise 
in labor costs (and a labor dispute). These issues have led to a return on equity (ROE) of just 6.7% - well below that 
Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: United Airlines , American Airlines , Southwest Airlines , Ryanair 
and Copa Airlines
of the S&P 500 Index and a signal that the company is poorly managed and inefficient. While the larger carriers 
have to contend with these same issues, the impact is being felt more by the smaller carriers. Small Foreign 
Carriers Thus far in 2023, foreign carriers such as Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Ryanair Holdings have 
outperformed. Ryanair, known for its cheap flights around Europe, is experiencing robust demand. Despite the 
strong price action in the stock, management does not seem content. RYAAY is purchasing more than 200 
BoeingMax jets to expand its fleet. Shares of RYAAY are attempting to break out over $100. If the stock can clear 
the psychologically important level, it opens the door to $120 by year end. 
Perhaps no other airline has handled the many challenges thrown at the industry as well as Zacks Rank #1 (Strong 
Buy) Copa Airlines. For example, while most airlines were unprofitable in 2020 and 2021 after the pandemic shock, 
Copa was back in the green by 2021. While rising fuel costs remain a headwind, CPA's prudent cost-management 
efforts are paying off. In the most recent reported quarter, passenger servicing and maintenance costs each 
dropped by more than 20%. CPA shares continue to ride the rising 50-day moving average and are set to move 
higher. Takeaway The Zacks Transportation - Airline Industry is one of the strongest industries tracked by Zacks. 
The strength in airlines can be attributed to a resurgence in air traffic which is driving earnings higher. Because the 
industry is in the top 26% of all industries, investors should expect airlines to outperform over the next 12 months. 
However, not all airline stocks deserve your attention. Stick to large U.S.-based carriers or smaller foreign carriers 
as opposed to small domestic carriers, which are feeling the impact of rising fuel costs. Why Haven't You Looked at 
Zacks' Top Stocks? Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per 
year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year. Today you can access

 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] is being affected by high fuel costs. The airline's fuel and oil expenses increased by 
more than 50% year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Dec 31, 2022). Also, a ramp-up in RYAAY's 
operations is pushing up total costs. 
Total operating expenses rose more than 35% year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2023, with a substantial 
increase in airport and handling charges, among other costs. Labor-related woes are also hurting operations at 
Ryanair. 
Total operating expenses rose more than 35% year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2023, with a substantial 
increase in airport and handling charges, among other costs. Labor-related woes are also hurting operations at 
Ryanair. 
However, a rebound in air-travel demand following the easing of COVID-related restrictions is a huge boon for 
Ryanair. On the back of buoyant traffic scenario in the Christmas/New Year period, RYAAY's profit after tax in third-
quarter fiscal 2023 was €211 million against a net loss of €96 million incurred a year ago. 
Continuing the trend, the number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in February registered an impressive 
figure of 10.6 million. This compared favorably with the year-ago figure of 8.7 million. 
Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) was 92% in February 2023 compared with 86% a year ago. Ryanair 
expects its traffic in fiscal 2023 to be 165 million, indicating 11% growth from the pre-COVID-19 traffic numbers. 
Below we present the fourth-quarter 2022 results of some other Zacks Airline[2] industry stocks that too benefited 
from buoyant air traffic. 
Owing to upbeat air-travel demand, operating revenues at American Airlines AAL[3] in fourth-quarter 2022 
increased 39.3% year over year. Buoyant air-travel demand is also reflected by the total operating revenue increase 
of 16.6% from the fourth-quarter 2019 (pre- COVID-19) levels despite 6.1% lower capacity. 
In the December quarter, passenger revenues, accounting for the bulk of the top line (92%), increased to $12,131 
million from $8,382 million a year ago, driven by strong air-travel demand, mainly on the domestic front. Driven by 
soaring demand on healthy bookings, management expects total unit revenues in the first quarter of 2023 to be 
roughly 24-27% higher than the level recorded in first-quarter 2022. 
Bullish Air Traffic Cushions Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Against Cost Woes
Owing to buoyant air-travel demand, United Airlines UAL[4] posted a significant year over year increase (about 
51.37%) in fourth-quarter 2022 revenues. The massive year-over-year increase in the top line was driven by 62.9% 
rise in passenger revenues (accounting for 90.3% of the top line) to $11,202 million. 
Moreover, passenger revenues increased 12.8% from fourth-quarter 2019 reading. Nearly 39 million passengers 
traveled on UAL flights in the December quarter. 
Driven by solid demand, UAL's management expects total revenue per available seat mile to grow almost 25% year 
over year for the first quarter of 2023. Total revenues are anticipated to grow almost 50% year over year. United 
Airlines expects first-quarter 2023 earnings per share in the $0.5-$1.00 band.

Few of us have exhausted our list of places to visit. That is what Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr thinks. 
His airline is "back" as bookings soar. Really he means his airline should start earning more from shuttling people 
rather than cargo fares. That is the key to Lufthansa shares staying aloft.
Shareholders loved Lufthansa's profit recovery last year. The stock price - up 68 per cent in six months - has outrun 
those of most regional rivals. A decent full-year result yesterday, bolstering the balance sheet with (EURO)2.5bn of 
free cash flow, led to another 6 per cent rise. That strong run partly stems from a successful diversification of group 
earnings. Not only cargo but also its maintenance business (Lufthansa Technik) have delivered all group operating 
profits since 2019. That said, Lufthansa would like to sell a stake in the latter to lower its net debt (including 
pensions) to an ebitda ratio below the current 2.3 times.
Investors also love Spohr's optimism. Passenger bookings for this spring and summer have surpassed that seen in 
2019, he said. But how much they will enjoy the experience is another story.
Bottlenecks on staffing have caused problems for even the most efficient airlines; see Southwest's experience 
during this winter's US storms. That explains Spohr's goal of increasing staff this year by a tenth over 2021.
Not that rivals are sitting on the tarmac. Ryanair, Wizz and easyJet should exceed 2019 capacity this spring, says 
Bank of America. Longhaul flights will have to make up the difference for Lufthansa, led by the lower-fare leisure 
traveller. Even
Lufthansa admits that more profitable corporate bookings should still be 15 per cent below pre-pandemic levels in 
2024. Lufthansa will double its shorthaul cargo fleet just as profitability normalises from very high levels. Lower fuel 
Lufthansa : fare trade
costs, too, boost earnings. But better earnings only tempt the industry's insatiable desire for capacity growth and 
fare wars.

Airlines have soared back to profit and predict booming demand will push earnings even higher over the next year, 
in a striking turnround for one of the industries worst hit by the pandemic.
The world's largest airlines reported $6.3bn in net profit in 2022, a marked reversal from a combined $40bn in 
losses over the previous two years, according to a Financial Times analysis of FactSet and Capital IQ data.
The figures cover eight of the 10 largest airlines by passenger numbers, but exclude Chinese groups which were 
still subject to travel restrictions in 2022.
Sales in 2022 surpassed pre-pandemic levels, driven in particular by strong growth from Turkish Airlines and Indian 
carrier Indigo.
People have flocked back to air travel as restrictions have ended, most recently in China, and there are few signs 
that economic worries will hold back demand in coming months.
Lufthansa yesterday became the latest airline to report an annual profit and strong demand for travel despite 
weaknesses in the global economy. "In just one year, we have achieved an unprecedented financial turnround," 
said chief executive Carsten Spohr.
Airlines shake off pandemic clouds and soar back to profit Biggest carriers post $6.3bn in earnings ? US beats 
Europe to stage recovery
The German flag carrier reported an operating profit of (EURO)1.5bn for 2022, up from a (EURO)1.7bn loss the 
previous year. Both revenues and passenger numbers roughly doubled. The airline said it expected "a significant 
improvement" in profitability this year as "demand for air travel remains high".
The results came as Australian airline Qantas said it expected to hire 8,500 people over the next decade to rebuild 
its workforce, having cut staffing significantly at the height of the pandemic.
Air France-KLM and British Airways owner IAG have also reported a return to profit in recent weeks, and predicted 
the recovery will continue.
In Europe, many low-cost airlines plan to fly more passengers this summer than in 2019. Ryanair, the region's 
largest airline, has forecast a higher profit for its financial year ending in March than in 2019. "This is not a one or 
two or three-quarter wonder ... I would be optimistic the industry can get back to 2019 profitability levels," said 
Stephen Furlong, a European airlines analyst at Davy.
Global air traffic reached 91 per cent of 2019 levels this month, according to data provider Cirium.
The recovery in the US was faster than in Europe, with some airlines returning to profit in 2021 thanks to a large 
domestic market, few travel restrictions and generous subsidies from the US government. Airlines have yet to fully 
rebuild their pre-pandemic flight schedules, with the industry facing constraints including shortages of new planes 
and staff. This has kept profits well below 2019 levels in most cases, two-thirds down for IAG, but also contributed 
to higher ticket prices because of limited supply in the face of booming demand.
"The supply and demand dynamics are different than they've ever been in my career," United Airlines chief 
executive Scott Kirby said.
In the longer run, analysts said a full return to pre-pandemic profitability relied on increasing capacity.
"Some have already recovered dramatically more than others, it is partly a function of how quickly you can get back 
your 2019 capacity," Furlong said.
Some airlines must also contend with the slow return of demand in parts of Asia-Pacific, complicated by expensive 
diversions because of the closure of Russian airspace, plus questions over how fully business travel will recover.
IAG chief executive Luis Gallego said the business would still take "a few years" to hit pre-pandemic profitability, 
absent a new macroeconomic shock. Additional reporting by Claire Bushey in Chicago, Nic Fildes in Sydney and

weaknesses in the global economy. "In just one year, we have achieved an unprecedented financial turnround," 
said chief executive Carsten Spohr.
Airlines shake off pandemic clouds and soar back to profit Biggest carriers post $6.3bn in earnings US beats 
Europe to stage recovery
The German flag carrier reported an operating profit of (EURO)1.5bn for 2022, up from a (EURO)1.7bn loss the 
previous year. Both revenues and passenger numbers roughly doubled. The airline said it expected "a significant 
improvement" in profitability this year as "demand for air travel remains high".
The results came as Australian airline Qantas said it expected to hire 8,500 people over the next decade to rebuild 
its workforce, having cut staffing significantly at the height of the pandemic.
Air France-KLM and British Airways owner IAG have also reported a return to profit in recent weeks, and predicted 
the recovery will continue.
In Europe, many low-cost airlines plan to fly more passengers this summer than in 2019. Ryanair, the region's 
largest airline, has forecast a higher profit for its financial year ending in March than in 2019. "This is not a one or 
two or three-quarter wonder ... I would be optimistic the industry can get back to 2019 profitability levels," said 
Stephen Furlong, a European airlines analyst at Davy.
Global air traffic reached 91 per cent of 2019 levels this month, according to data provider Cirium.
The recovery in the US was faster than in Europe, with some airlines returning to profit in 2021 thanks to a large 
domestic market, few travel restrictions and generous subsidies from the US government. Airlines have yet to fully 
rebuild their pre-pandemic flight schedules, with the industry facing constraints including shortages of new planes 
and staff. This has kept profits well below 2019 levels in most cases, two-thirds down for IAG, but also contributed 
to higher ticket prices because of limited supply in the face of booming demand.
"The supply and demand dynamics are different than they've ever been in my career," United Airlines chief 
executive Scott Kirby said.
In the longer run, analysts said a full return to pre-pandemic profitability relied on increasing capacity.
"Some have already recovered dramatically more than others, it is partly a function of how quickly you can get back 
your 2019 capacity," Furlong said.
Some airlines must also contend with the slow return of demand in parts of Asia-Pacific, complicated by expensive 
diversions because of the closure of Russian airspace, plus questions over how fully business travel will recover.
IAG chief executive Luis Gallego said the business would still take "a few years" to hit pre-pandemic profitability, 
absent a new macroeconomic shock. Additional reporting by Claire Bushey in Chicago, Nic Fildes in Sydney and

Airlines have soared back to profit and predict booming demand will push earnings even higher over the next year, 
in a striking turnround for one of the industries worst hit by the pandemic.
The world's largest airlines reported $6.3bn in net profit in 2022, a marked reversal from a combined $40bn in 
losses over the previous two years, according to a Financial Times analysis of FactSet and Capital IQ data.
The figures cover eight of the 10 largest airlines by passenger numbers, but exclude Chinese groups which were 
still subject to travel restrictions in 2022.
Sales in 2022 surpassed pre-pandemic levels, driven in particular by strong growth from Turkish Airlines and Indian 
carrier Indigo.
People have flocked back to air travel as restrictions have ended, most recently in China, and there are few signs 
that economic worries will hold back demand in coming months.

Zeus, the Irish-owned global packaging supply chain solutions company, has today announced the opening of a 
70,000sq ft logistics facility in Watergrasshill, Cork. 
The new facility will see the creation of 40 new roles over the next 18 months and is set to be operational by Apri.
The new roles in Cork will be created across logistics, distribution, commercial and administration. With over 12,000 
pallet space, the Watergrasshill facility has 12m clear internal eaves, five dock levellers and will operate voice 
controlled ‘Warehouse Management System’ integrating four other logistics centres within Limerick and Dublin.
Customers of Zeus range across sectors and include Kaufland, Lidl, Aldi, ABP, Harrods, Musgrave, Ryanair and 
McDonalds. 
During the past 12 months Zeus have added a further €75m of revenue through acquisition.

revenues of more than €500m.
Officially opening the facility today, Minister for Finance, Michael McGrath said, “Zeus is an inspirational example of 
a home-grown company scaling internationally, having been founded by Brian O’Sullivan in 1998. Having followed 
their global growth with interest, I am delighted to today open the new Watergrasshill logistics facility, which will 
provide a major boost for the local economy.”
Founder of Zeus, Brian O’Sullivan added, “I grew up in east Cork, and it’s where I started my working life. I am very 
proud to now be reinvesting back in my local roots, opening this new facility in Watergrasshill. This will greatly

Investors wrongfooted by airline sector's revival

A irlines are defying gravity.
The global economy is weak and inflation is fuelling a cost of living crisis, yet there is an apparently relentless 
demand for flying.
Low-cost airlines in Europe are touting record booking sprees. US carriers cannot find enough planes to meet 
demand. Air India has decided now is the time to place one of history's biggest aircraft orders. Passengers are 
swallowing high ticket prices, helping drive airlines back into profit and leading Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, 
poster child of the bargain fare, to declare that the era of the ultra-cheap flight is over.
The resilience has wrongfooted investors, who sold shares in the second half of last year as the economic outlook 
darkened, safe in the knowledge that carriers have never been immune to the wider economy's rhythms.
The industry's fortunes are typically closely linked to GDP growth and economic cycles, and for months it has felt 
like some executives and analysts have been on tenterhooks waiting for the first cracks in demand to appear. Yet 
there are signs that air travel could have more room to grow.
Most obviously, this is not a normal environment. The pandemic has not dented demand for foreign holidays, 
however pleasant those staycations were. If anything, it has increased it.
Investors wrongfooted by airline sector's revival
O'Leary said at the height of the crisis: "Everyone who has been trapped and gone on holiday to Bognor Regis will 
want to go to Portugal, Italy and Greece."
Moreover, as analysts at Barclays note, the majority of air travel is undertaken by wealthier travellers, typically 
people who make many trips a year, meaning the industry's key consumers are insulated from the worst of the cost 
of living crisis. A significant portion of the population, many of whom will have been badly hit by inflation, rarely flew 
anyway. More than a third of people in the UK did not take a foreign holiday at all in 2019, according to ABTA, the 
travel association. In contrast, fortunate higher earners are sitting on savings built up during the pandemic.
Analysts at Morgan Stanley in January calculated that US households spent roughly 30 per cent of their $2.7tn 
"excess savings" in 2022, leaving a considerable buffer against inflation.
These factors powering the pent-up demand for leisure travel seem strong.
But even if they fade, airlines have two types of travellers to fall back on. First, a recovery in business travel is 
under way, even if some will surely be lost to remote working and heightened environmental concerns. British 
Airways owner IAG last month said business travel had returned to 70 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, and it is 
targeting a return to 85 per cent. Second, some of the most important passengers are those flying to visit friends 
and relatives, typically expats popping home.
These by-products of globalisation can amount to up to 30 per cent of all passengers, and have proved highly 
resilient. Taken together with a slightly brightening economic outlook, the sector's trickiest challenge could be 
working out how many more planes to fly.
Many low-cost airlines are above their pre-crisis flying levels, but the big flag carriers have been more circumspect.
Capacity for summer in Europe is close to 2019 levels but growing slowly, with year-on-year growth of 8 per cent for 
regional trips, according to Barclays. Several factors have held back capacity, notably shortages of staff, planes and 
spare parts. These supply constraints have created favourable conditions for profits as the surge in demand has 
allowed airlines to raise prices, according to Brian Pearce, former chief economist at airline trade body Iata.
But as the supply environment normalises and more planes are available, the fast growth in fares can be expected 
to moderate, pressing margins.
Airline shares have staged a strong recovery, with MSCI's global airlines index up 27 per cent since September, 
though still one-third below its prepandemic levels.
Investors have been burnt before by the industry, and the pandemic reinforced its vulnerability to unexpected 
shocks. But for now, there could be further to fly for long-suffering airlines and their share prices.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Thursday posted traffic growth for February, 
as the travel sector continues its post-Covid-19 bounce. 
Dublin-based Ryanair said passengers numbers in February grew 22% to 10.6 million from 8.7 million a year 
earlier. 
Its load factor improved to 92% from 86%. 
The low-cost airline noted February 2022's outcome was hurt by Omicron travel curbs and the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine. 
In the 12 months to the end of February, passenger numbers were 93% higher at 167.2 million, the carrier said. 
Wizz carried 3.8 million passengers last month, a 97% jump on-year. Capacity was 92% higher at 4.1 million and its 
load factor improved to 93.3% from 91.0%. 
For the rolling 12 months to February, capacity was 74% higher at 56.4 million and passengers numbers jumped 
97% to 49.3 million. 
Ryanair shares were 0.7% lower at EUR14.89 each in Dublin on Thursday morning. In London, Wizz Air shot-up 
4.1% to 2,727.46p.

SMBC Aviation Capital has placed three Boeing 737-800s on lease to South African low-cost carrier Fly Safair in 
recent months, a review of Airfinance Journal Fleet Tracker data shows.
The Japanese bank-backed lessor leased two 2016-vintage, ex-Lion Air 737-800s in late 2022, according to Fleet 
Tracker.
A third 2009-vintage narrowbody was added this month. The aircraft was first acquired by SMBC AC via sale and 
leaseback with Ryanair and was most recently operated by Ukraine International Airlines.
SMBC AC was not immediately available for comment.
Earlier in 2022 the carrier agreed to lease a 2011-vintage 737-800 from Aero Capital Solutions (ACS).
ACS acquired the aircraft from Fuyo General Lease (FGL) via transaction arranger Aircraft Leasing and 
Management (ALM).
The unit was previously on lease to Ryanair.
Fly Safair currently has 34 737 aircraft in its fleet. Its lessor pool also includes Aircastle, ASL Aviation, Merx 
Aviation, Avolon and Carlyle Aviation, Fleet Tracker shows.

Ryanair has resumed discussions with Boeing around a new narrowbody order, chief executive officer Michael 
O'Leary has told the Financial Times.
O'Leary said the low-cost carrier is once again looking to complete another large Boeing 737 Max 8200 or new 737 
Max 10 order, noting favourable changes in pricing.
A narrowbody purchase deal involving the 737 Max 10 fell through in 2021 over diverging views on pricing.
On Ryanair's third-quarter results call in January, O'Leary said any potential order would be "entirely down to 
pricing and whether there is a material cost per seat advantage".
He noted the company would be willing to look at the Max 10 when it gets certified and when Boeing is able to 
deliver it, and as long as it offers a reasonable discount on the additional 30 seats that come with the extended 
narrowbody.
O'Leary said the vast majority of Ryanair's growth will come from its Boeing orderbook rather than temporary 
leases. The carrier is looking to take delivery of at least 45 new 197-seat 737 Max 8200s by this summer.
The US manufacturer had delivered nine new 737 Max aircraft to Ryanair with 117 remaining on the carrier's 
backlog as of 28 February, according to Boeing data.

Boeing gained just two net orders in February as unnamed customers ordered five 737 Max aircraft but also 
cancelled three Max commitments.
This compares with 40 new commercial aircraft orders in January - seven widebody 787-10s and 33 737 Max units 
- for a total of 45 commercial Boeing aircraft orders this year to date.
On the deliveries front, Boeing handed over 28 aircraft in February, down from 38 in January.
February's deliveries included 24 Max units, the final 747-8F, a 777F to Air China Cargo and a 787-10 to United 
Airlines.
The 737 Max shipments went to United and Southwest (five each); Ryanair (four); Alaska, Flydubai and Pembroke 
(two each); as well as single 737 Max deliveries to 777 Partners, Air Lease (ALC); Oman Air and Iraqi Airways.
Other than the single 787 for United, Boeing's 787 deliveries remained paused in February amid fresh quality 
problems although they are expected to resume next week.
In March the OEM confirmed an order for up to 121 widebody 787 aircraft from Saudi Arabia.
Furthermore, Boeing is yet to log Air India's landmark 777, 787 and 737 Max order, amounting to 220 Boeing 
aircraft.

Turkish Airlines surprises with $2.7 billion profit
Turkish Airlines surprises with $2.7 billion profit

 Turkish Airlines[1] surprised with a $2.7 billion net profit for 2022, one of the highest seen within the industry so far 
and not even matched by the three US carriers. The carrier is citing strong revenue development that saw last year 
outpace 2019 at every level. 
The net profit of $2.725 billion compares to $959 million in 2021[2]. Revenues grew to $18.246 billion from $10.686 
billion, of which $14.291 was from passengers and $3.735 billion came from cargo. It carried 71.8 million 
passengers with a domestic load factor of 85.8 percent and an international load factor of 80.1 percent. 
Expenses increased to $15.710 billion from $9.411 billion in the previous year. The fuel bill hit $6.467 billion, up 
from $2.756 billion as it was hedged for 36 percent. EBITDAR was $5.377 billion (2021: $3.744 billion), and the 
operating profit was $3.193 billion ($1.689 billion). Net debt stood at $9.124 billion. 
'In spite of the inflation pressures on the global scale, the flag carrier maintained its effective cost management in 
2022 by lowering its unit expenses excluding fuel by two percent compared to 2019. As a result, EBITAR, which 
demonstrates the cash generation potential of the company, realized as $5.4 billion,' the airline says in a media 
statement. 
Unit revenues  
Passenger unit revenues were back in the green for all geographic regions to on average $7.08 from $5.00 in 2021. 
Those to Europe were the highest ahead of the Middle East and Africa. Those to the Far East were even higher 
than to the Americas, despite capacity in available seat kilometers being 16.5 percent down to Asia compared to 
2019 whereas the capacity to the Americas was up 65.1 percent. 
Turkish Airlines likes to compare its 2022 results with those of 2019, the last year before the Covid-crisis. Back 
then, the net profit was $788 million, total revenues $13.229 billion, expenses $10.928 billion, EBITDAR $3.107 
billion, and the operating profit $1.047 billion. Passenger revenues were up 28 percent, and cargo revenues by 121 
percent. 
The fourth quarter paints another picture. Turkish reported a $473 million net profit, which is more than double that 
of the same quarter in 2021 but down on the $1.515 billion produced in Q3[3]. Revenues totaled $4.772 billion in 
Q4 2022, $3.309 billion the year before, and $6.068 billion in Q3. The operating profit of $615 million compares to 
$554 million in Q 2021 and to $1.437 billion in Q3. 
Market share 
Turkish Airlines surprises with $2.7 billion profit
Turkish notes that together with Ryanair and Qatar Airways, it is one of the few airlines that has consistently grown 
global market share over the past decade. It now stands at 2.7 percent, up 1.7 percent since 2010 and on par with 
Qatar. While American Airlines sets the benchmark at 4.9 percent, Turkish says it has some big names in the 
rearview mirror like Air France-KLM, Lufthansa, and British Airways. Subsidiary AnadoluJet has also grown its 
market share, from 13.3 percent in 2019 to 64.5 percent last year. Market share in cargo has quadrupled in the last 
ten years. 
Turkish Airlines ended 2022 with a fleet of 394 aircraft, up twenty year on year. It took delivery of thirteen Airbus 
A321neo's and three A320neo's, six (ex-Aeroflot) A350-900s, eight Boeing MAX 8s, and one 787-9. AnadoluJet's 
fleet stood at 64. The airline will take fifteen new aircraft in 2023. Turkish has contracts for eighty aircraft to be 
delivered this year through 2028 plus five options. 
The presentation was overshadowed by the grief for the victims of the devastating earthquakes that hit the East of 
Turkey on February 6. Since then, Turkish has flown over 2.400 flights to ferry rescue workers and materials to the 
affected area.

Mercedes-Benz and Aufrecht, Melcher and Grossaspach - better known to the world as AMG - have always been 
curious bedfellows. One is conservative and mild-mannered, the other rebellious and hedonistic. Whereas BMW M 
and Audi Sport feel broadly aligned with their respective parents, AMG drifts off on a tyre-smoking tangent.
The SL has traditionally been a very 'Mercedes-Benz' sort of sports car. Picture the original 190 SL of 1955 (like a 
Gullwing minus the doors), the beautiful 'Pagoda' model that followed, Bobby Ewing's scene-stealing 450 SL in 
Dallas or the crisply elegant 'R129' SL of 1989. Now, as this most glamorous and distinguished roadster nears its 
70th anniversary, AMG has gatecrashed the cocktail party. Uh-oh… There have been AMG versions of the
SL before, of course, but this is the first version developed entirely in Affalterbach. Contrary to rumours, it doesn't 
also replace the AMG GT - which returns in coupe-only format later this year - but it does channel some of its 
chutzpah. You sense the Porsche 911 Cabriolet is firmly in AMG's crosshairs.
Topping the range is the 585hp SL 63 - yours for a somewhat alarming £176,000. Next up is the SL 55, which uses 
a 476hp version of the same 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 and costs a smidge over £147,000. Then there is the entry-level 
SL 43, with a 381hp four-cylinder engine and a projected price tag of £110,000. It's the middleranking SL 55 we're 
driving here.
In the metal (largely aluminium, although it still weighs a portly 1,870kg), the new SL looks every inch the AMG 
muscle car, with a broad grille, power-bulged bonnet and pur- posefully squat stance. I suspect it won't age as 
gracefully as its ancestors, but it certainly has plenty of presence.
ROLLING THUNDER Tim Pitt drives the new Mercedes-AMG SL 55, a sportier take on the glamorous German 
roadster.
While the previous two generations of SL had folding hard-top roofs, this 'R232' model reverts to a fabric soft-top. 
It's also the first SL with two rear seats as standard, although my eight-year-old whinged about the bolt-upright 
backrests and Ryanair levels of legroom. Best to treat them as extra luggage space, I think, to supplement the 
modest 240-litre boot (213 litres with the roof stowed).
When it came to the SL's glitzy, techladen dashboard, however, young Jessica was robustly in favour, while her 
dad felt slightly overwhelmed by it all. A giant central touchscreen adjusts its position to be more readable in bright 
sunshine, and multicolour ambient lighting makes the cabin feel genuinely futuristic at night. Call me old-fashioned, 
though (and she did) but I really don't need a car to wish me Happy Valentine's Day - complete with showers of pink 
cartoon hearts. Bah, humbug.
Fire up the engine and you're rewarded with AMG's signature Sturm und Drang. A menacing V8 backbeat is 
overlaid with a metallic rasp as the revs soar, the four square tailpipes detonating with gratuitous glee. It's a bit 
childish, perhaps even anti-social, but it can't fail to make you smile.
With similar power and performance to a 911 GTS, the SL 55 isn't supercar-quick. However, a brawny 516lb ft of 
torque, on tap from just 2,000rpm, means you never feel shortchanged on the road. Factor in four-wheel drive, a 
nine-speed auto gearbox and stability-enhancing rearwheel steering, and the result is confident and very rapid 
progress.
Where the SL does trail the sports car from the far side of Stuttgart is in terms of engagement. Its steering feels 
oddly artificial and no amount of electronics can entirely mask all that weight. Then again, not everyone wants to 
drive like their pants are on fire, and the SL still does the longstriding, luxurious GT thing very well. Overall, it's an 
easy car to admire, but a harder one to love - no matter how many hearts it tries to woo me with. Tim Pitt writes for

 Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[1] is benefiting from the improvement in traffic from the pandemic-led slump. 
Measures to expand its fleet and bring down debt levels are encouraging too. 
Against this backdrop, let's look at the factors that make this stock an attractive pick. What Makes RYAAY an 
Attractive Pick? An Outperformer: A glimpse at the company's price trend reveals that the stock has had an 
impressive run on the bourse over the past six months. Shares of RYAAY have gained 29.1% over the past six 
months, outperforming the 7.8% rise of the industry[2] it belongs to. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Solid Zacks Rank: RYAAY has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank 
#1 or 2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities. Thus, the company is a compelling investment proposition at 
the moment. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.[3] 
Northward Estimate Revisions:The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to 
the price of a stock. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for RYAAY's 2023 and 2024 earnings 
has moved up 20.8% and 15.6%, year over year, respectively. 
Positive Earnings Surprise History: RYAAY has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company delivered an 
earnings surprise of 7.51% in the last four quarters, on average. 
Earnings Expectations: Earnings growth and stock price gains often indicate a company's prospects. For 2023 and 
2024, RYAAY's earnings are expected to grow more than 100% and 1.93% year over year, respectively. 
Growth Factors: An improvement in Ryanair's traffic from the pandemic-led slump is encouraging. Ryanair now 
aims to increase its traffic in fiscal 2023 to 168 million, indicating 13% growth from the pre-COVID traffic numbers. 
The prior view was 165 million. Riding on the buoyant traffic scenario, RYAAY lifted its forecast for fiscal 2023 
profitability. 
Measures to expand its fleet to cater to the improvement in travel demand are encouraging. In fiscal 2022, the 
airline took delivery of 61 B737-8200 jets. It expects to have more than 70 of these jets in its fleet for the peak 
summer season. The remaining jets are expected to be delivered by the end of fiscal 2025. Efforts to bring down 
debt levels are encouraging too. Other Stocks to Consider Some other top-ranked stocks from the broader

 The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the committee's top Republican urged the Biden 
administration to halt Chinese airlines and other non-American carriers from flying over Russia on U.S. routes. 
Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat, and James Risch, the committee's top Republican, in a letter seen by 
Reuters urged the Biden administration to ensure no commercial airline overflying Russian territory arrives or 
departs from a U.S. airport. 
It also encouraged the administration to "strongly and publicly discourage U.S. persons, citizens, and permanent 
residents from traveling on flights over Russian territory." 
U.S. airlines and other foreign carriers are barred from flying over Russia. Russia banned airlines from the United 
States from overflights after the U.S. barred Russia flights in March 2022 following its invasion of Ukraine. 
"An additional byproduct of the current situation is that it puts U.S. airlines at a competitive disadvantage relative to 
airlines from other countries willing to do business with Russia," the senators wrote to Secretary of State Antony 
Blinken and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg that was copied to White House National Security Adviser Jake 
Sullivan. 
The agencies did not immediately comment. 
U.S. air carriers currently serve Shanghai from the United States through a stop in Incheon, South Korea, while 
Chinese carriers serve the United States directly, flying through Russian airspace. 
The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately comment. 
The senators want the Biden administration to prohibit U.S. government personnel on official travel from taking 
flights known to use Russian airspace.  
"The risk to Americans flying over Russian airspace is real, as demonstrated by Russian-backed separatists that 
shot down a Malaysian Airlines flight, killing all 298 passengers on board, or the government of Belarus, using as a 
pretense a false-bomb alert, ordered a Ryanair flight over its territory to land so that it could seize and detain a 
particular passenger," the senators wrote.  
"Proactive action taken by the Administration now would protect Americans from these significant risks, as well as 
closing off a funding source to the Russian government and addressing an inequity that puts U.S. companies at a 
disadvantage to foreign competition."

Only way is Sussex
Air New Zealand has found itself embroiled in the controversy over Prince Harry’s autobiography.
In Spare, the Duke of Sussex claims his wife Meghan had booked a first-class ticket on the ­
flag carrier from Mexico to the UK for her father Thomas Markle. She believed the press was less likely to harass 
him if he avoided one of the main transatlantic carriers.
However, Air New Zealand stated that it has never operated flights between the two countries, and, what’s more, 
does not have a first-class cabin.
“Introducing #SussexClass. Apparently coming soon,” it quipped on Twitter.
Technically, Markle senior could have flown – with a US stop – on Star Alliance partner United Airlines, but that 
would not seem to fit the narrative of Meghan wanting him to come in via the back door.
He could also have gone the long way round, via Auckland, an unlikely round trip of around 40h.
Supporters of the exiled royals have weighed in on the social media platform to criticise the airline’s supposed lack 
of sensitivity. Others enjoyed the joke.
Network trouble
Airbus’s lavish start-the-year event in London was “all about networking”, according to chief executive Guillaume 
Faury, but he clearly was not happy about a more annoying form of reception that repeatedly served to interrupt his 
brief speech to the assembled dignitaries, politicians and customers.
After one attendee had scrambled to silence a second – and extremely loud – incoming call barely two minutes into 
his address, a mid-flow Faury quipped: “In every crisis there lies also an opportunity… to switch your mobile phone 
off!”
No Headline In Original
Much mirth ensued, only to be followed five minutes later by another guest’s phone disrupting proceedings.
At this point, a surprisingly still gracious Faury shared some of the wisdom that helped to propel him to the top job 
at the world’s largest producer of commercial aircraft.
“Wise people learn from their mistakes. Very wise people learn from the mistakes of others.”
First-class fare
Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary rarely misses an opportunity to press home the message that no rival can beat his 
airline on cost.
And so it was at a press event in January – except that O’Leary’s penurious point lost some of its impact, given the 
decidedly un-low-cost venue in which he was speaking: the luxury Pan Pacific Hotel in the City of London.
Blaming booming demand for meeting space in the capital, Ryanair had failed to secure its preferred, economical 
press conference venue, and been forced to go five-star instead.
As a result, journalists – accustomed to being offered coffee and a small packet of sweets at O’Leary’s usual 
audiences – found themselves able to listen to the great man while enjoying delicacies such as halloumi and 
hummus wraps.
O’Leary could only encourage the journalists to make the most of the impressive spread, while trying to retain some 
of the Ryanair spirit in restricting his own intake to a glass of skimmed milk.
Name calling
Protecting your Internet domain name is a basic part of conducting business online, but it doesn’t hurt to think 
laterally if you expect people’s intentions might be less than honourable – or if there’s a risk you might hack off your 
customers.
Corporate filings from resurrected UK regional airline Flybe – which ceased operations in January, just a few 
months into its revival – list trademarks and dozens of domain names as part of its intellectual property.
While most, unsurprisingly, relate to such activities as holidays, careers and training, some domains appear to have 
been bought up in a bid to foil attempts to stir up adverse publicity.
Among the websites owned by the airline are appealing examples such as ‘flybestinks’, ‘flybesucks’ and, for good 
measure, ‘ihateflybe’.
Whether any of these domains will be made available for sale by Flybe’s administrators is yet to become clear but 
if, for whatever reason, you’re looking to vent your spleen in cyberspace, you could try putting in an offer.

Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) has been named the worst short-haul airline by UK passengers, according to a 
survey by consumer group Which?.
Passengers gave the Hungary-based carrier one star out of five for boarding experience, cabin environment and 
seat comfort.
The budget airline's seat pitch, the difference between two rows in standard economy, is 28 inches, two inches 
smaller than rival Ryanair.
No more than two stars were awarded in any of the remaining categories, including value for money and 
cleanliness.
The FTSE 250-listed airline runs short-haul flights from eight UK airports, including Birmingham, Edinburgh, 
Gatwick and Luton.
The airline's overall customer score of 48% put it at the bottom of the ranking, below Ryanair (52%), Eurowings 
(53%) and British Airways (56%).
Jet2.com had the highest score (80%) in the Which? research, ahead of Turkish Airlines (78%).
In December, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it had "significant concerns" about Wizz Air's "unacceptable" 
behaviour as its passengers were far more likely to make escalated complaints than those of other carriers.

(Alliance News) - Wizz Air Holdings PLC has been named the worst short-haul airline by UK passengers.
Passengers surveyed by consumer group Which? gave the Hungary-based carrier one star out of five for boarding 
experience, cabin environment and seat comfort.
The budget airline's seat pitch – the difference between two rows in standard economy – is 28 inches, some two 
inches smaller than rival Ryanair.
No more than two stars were awarded in any of the remaining categories, including value for money and 
cleanliness.
Wizz Air operates short-haul flights from eight UK airports including Birmingham, Edinburgh, Gatwick and Luton.
The airline's overall customer score of 48% put it at the bottom of the ranking, below Ryanair Holdings PLC (52%), 
Eurowings (53%) and British Airways (56%).
In December, the Civil Aviation Authority said it has "significant concerns" about Wizz Air's "unacceptable" 
behaviour as its passengers were far more likely to make escalated complaints than those of other carriers.
The regulator also found that the airline was delaying paying money owed to passengers.
Jet2 PLC had the highest score (80%) in the Which? research, ahead of Turkish Airlines (78%).
Which? Travel editor Rory Boland said: "Travellers have had a torrid time in recent years, with last-minute delays 
and cancellations an unacceptably common occurrence.
"While airlines like Jet2.com have distinguished themselves by offering flyers excellent customer care and a reliable 
service, too many of their competitors continually fail to measure up.

"If alternative carriers are available for your route, avoid Wizz Air, as its poor record on customer care means you're 
likely to be left high and dry in the event your flight is delayed or cancelled."
Which? surveyed 8,046 UK adults in October 2022 about their experiences of flying in the previous two years.
Customer scores for airlines were calculated from a combination of travellers' overall satisfaction and their 
likelihood to recommend.
A Wizz Air spokesman said: "At Wizz Air, we do everything possible to ensure that passengers reach their 
destination on time and with minimal delay.
"Wizz Air operates a fleet of brand new, state-of-the-art Airbus aircraft, with an average age of 4.6 years, which 
offer passengers comfort, space and modern interiors.
"The A321neo features the widest single-aisle cabin configuration with 239 18-inch-wide seats.
"Every aircraft is cleaned after each flight and deep cleaned every night."
A British Airways spokesman said: "We don't feel this small survey, conducted during one of the most challenging 
periods in global aviation, accurately represents the views of the tens of millions of customers who've chosen to fly 
with us over the same period.
"While we don't claim to get everything right every time, we continue to be recognised for the service we offer.
"Our customers tell us they appreciate being able to choose from a range of cabins, flying to and from central 
airports at convenient times of the day, plus our investment in new aircraft, new seating, wifi, new menus, the 
complimentary snacks and water we offer in our short-haul economy cabin, and the most generous hand baggage 
allowance of any UK airline."

Around the pandemic, a small corner of the business world had a Linda Evangelista moment. Except the 
supermodel came cheap. Evangelista said in 1990 that elite catwalkers didn't "wake up for less than $10,000 a 
day". A small club of company bosses couldn't rouse themselves without the chance of a payout of £100mn.
First in 2019 was Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, whose potential bonus was (EURO)100mn for getting the airline's 
shares to (EURO)21 "and/or" roughly doubling profits in five years. Then came fashion retailer Boohoo the following 
year with a three-year plan worth £100mn for its co-founders plus £50mn for executives on top of £50mn on offer to 
its chief, based on share price performance.
Wizz Air's József Váradi had to more than double the share price in five years to get his £100mn, agreed in 2021.
Michael Murray, son-in-law and successor to Mike Ashley at Frasers Group, could get stock worth £100mn if its 
shares more than double to £15 before October 2025.
None of these companies is terribly conventional from a governance point of view. All the packages were roughly 
billed as high-risk, high-reward "private equity-style" structures needed to retain and encourage founders or 
particularly entrepreneurial bosses.
All of them were frowned on by proxy agencies (along with a similar £65mn Cineworld plan), essentially because 
the numbers were too big. But the problem isn't really the size of the packages; it's that shareholders were sold a 
www.pup.No one should have believed that the boss would walk away with nothing if they didn't hit the jackpot. It 
Incentive pay doesn't always get best performance
doesn't happen - if the boss is untouchable or valuable enough to command this treatment, he doesn't accept the 
payout disappearing out of reach.
Ryanair last year extended O'Leary's contract to 2028, giving him an extra four years to hit his targets. In fairness, 
playing for time is right out of the private equity playbook when something goes wrong, in this case a pandemic.
Spreading the payout over a longer period isn't terrible for investors. O'Leary also has a slightly higher profit target 
to hit and will receive only base salary in the meantime. After a recent rally, the shares would have to rise more than 
40 per cent to hit their mark.
Boohoo's shares are down nearly 90 per cent since its three-digit pay plan. A new variant, announced last week, is 
objectionable: the overall size is only 13 per cent less than previous packages, although it covers more employees.
And it starts paying out at 95p, 77 per cent below the stock's 2020 high.
"We would certainly not expect such plans to be provided to incumbent management who were in charge while the 
share price hit the floor," was the verdict of one fund manager. But the original sin for Boohoo came last year, when 
the board put in place a traditional longterm incentive plan for its managers.
High-risk, high-reward payouts are meant to take the place of conventional schemes. Now Boohoo's leaders are 
double dipping, as the three-year LTIP remains in place despite the new "growth plan".
The remainder are a mixed bag. Cineworld is mired in Chapter 11 restructuring in the US. Frasers' Murray has 
headed in the right direction: its shares at about 800p are not far off their all- time high, up a quarter since his 
scheme was announced, although the board also added a profit hurdle.
Wizz Air looks next in danger of a rejig - Varadi's full payout relies on the shares going from £45 in 2021 to £120 but 
instead, they're at about £25.
It all makes questionable fodder for those who claim that racier pay packages inspire better performance, or that 
London's fastidious approach to pay is holding the market back.
Private equity, says Tom Gosling at London Business School, may be better equipped to renegotiate or axe bosses 
when required: "At listed companies one reason they've put these plans in place is that they have a dominant CEO 
who wants one, which itself is probably a red flag as to whether they have the strength of governance needed to 
handle these supercharged incentives."
Wake me up when someone walks away from one of these with nothing. helen.thomas@ft.com

 A former boyfriend of Ruja Ignatova, the mastermind of the Ponzi scheme Onecoin, has received five years in 
prison. The sentence is for the laundering of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of proceeds from the notorious 
crypto scam which defrauded investors around the world. 
Ruja's Former Boyfriend Sentenced for Money Laundering Linked to Onecoin 
Gilbert Armenta, the ex-boyfriend of crypto pyramid Onecoin's founder Ruja Ignatova, has been sentenced in the 
United States, Bloomberg Law reported[1]. According to court documents, he helped launder $300 million of 
proceeds from one of the largest Ponzi schemes in crypto history. 
In 2018, Armenta[2], now 59, pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit wire fraud, money laundering and extortion, all 
in connection with Onecoin. He cooperated with prosecutors in the investigation into the scam for about two years 
but later committed other crimes, violating the agreement. 
Founded in 2014, Onecoin operated as a global multi-level-marketing network, which was based on a 
cryptocurrency that never really existed as such, despite being advertised as the 'Bitcoin[3] killer.' According to 
Onecoin's own documents, more than 3 million people invested over $4 billion in Onecoin since 2016. 
Bulgarian-born German national Ruja Ignatova[4] disappeared in October 2017, when she boarded a Ryanair flight 
in Sofia bound for Athens. Still, at large[5], she is wanted by Interpol, Europol[6], and the U.S. Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI[7]). 
Her brother and co-founder, Konstantin, who was detained in Los Angeles in 2019, pleaded guilty to charges 
related to Onecoin and sought witness protection in the U.S. In December 2022, another co-founder, British and 
Swedish citizen Karl Sebastian Greenwood, also pleaded guilty[8] to his part in the scam. 
Crypto Pyramid Mastermind Ruja Ignatova Still Missing 
Information about Ignatova's whereabouts and activities has periodically surfaced in media reports. Last July, the 
leading Greek daily Kathimerini unveiled[5] that the Hellenic Police had tried to locate and arrest her, acting on 
intelligence indicating she was in the country and holding meetings with unidentified persons. 
In January of this year, British media uncovered that a $15-million apartment bought by the 'missing Cryptoqueen' 
through a company based on the island of Guernsey had been offered for sale. A BBC report on the matter 
revealed[9] that the Kensington penthouse had been listed with the approval of authorities in Germany. 
Onecoin Cryptoqueen's Ex-boyfriend Gets 5 Years in Prison
Prosecutors in the city of Bielefeld have accused a German lawyer who worked for Ignatova, Martin Breidenbach, of 
money laundering for the transfer of €20 million (over $21 million) for the purchase of the four-bedroom apartment. 
In October, he appeared[10] in court, along with two Onecoin associates, to face charges of fraud and other crimes. 
Do you think law enforcement authorities will eventually find Onecoin's founder Ruja Ignatova? Share your thoughts 
on the case in the comments section below.

After two pandemic-affected years, passenger numbers are growing again at Bergamo BRNO airport. In 2022, the 
airport handled exactly 471,811 passengers, which represents 153% growth when compared to the pandemic-
affected year of 2021.
The summer months of July and August were the most successful, when the airport saw more than 200,000 
passengers, in doing so surpassing the 'pre-Covid' year of 2019. This year, passengers will be able to fly to 29 
destinations from Brno. New additions include Portugal (Madeira), Albania, and Cape Verde.
The most popular holiday destinations of 2022 included Antalya in Turkey, the Egyptian resorts of Hurghada and 
Marsa Alam, Burgas in Bulgaria, and Heraklion and Rhodes in Greece. That could all change this year, however. 
Travellers will now be able to fly to up to 29 destinations from Brno, six of which are completely new additions. The 
regular route to the Italian city of Bergamo has also been renewed.
"I'm pleased that we have been able to continue to expand the range of flights from Brno and connect it with other 
destinations. As a result, we are expecting a strong season this year and are fully prepared," said Zdenek Soustal, 
board member of AIRPORT BRNO a.s.
Nearly 30 destinations and the return of a regular route to Bergamo
Presales of summer package holidays are approaching their peak and, according to travel agents, people are keen 
to fly from Brno. "At the moment it looks like we're in for another busy summer season at the airport, holidaymakers 
really do have a wide variety of destinations to choose from this year. These new additions include Madeira in

mention the Canary Islands, with one flight a week to Tenerife and now to Fuerteventura, too" explained Radek 
Lang, BRNO AIRPORT a.s. Head of Transport Operations.
At the end of March, the regular route to the Italian city of Bergamo will also resume. Ryanair will operate flights 
twice per week. After more than 10 years, we will also see the return of seasonal routes to Taba, another Egyptian 
destination for travellers to choose, to go alongside Hurghada and Marsa Alam.
The summer months contributed heavily to last year's figures
Bergamo airport had 472,000 passengers in 2022, expects strong season in 2023
Back in September, Brno Airport predicted that the total number of passengers would be just under 460,000 by the 
end of the year. In the end, the actual figure was some 10,000 passengers more than that prediction, representing 
87% of the pre-Covid year of 2019.
"The results from the year just gone were largely down to the summer months. Last year we had 1,200 more 
passengers in June and 3,100 more in August, when compared to 2019. We managed to deal with the summer 
peak. This at least partially made up for the two pandemic-affected years that came before," commented Zdenek 
Soustal, board member of AIRPORT BRNO a.s.
The total number of departures and arrivals at Brno Airport climbed to slightly over 24,000. The yearly record-setter 
in terms of the number of flights carried out is the regular, year-round route to London Stansted, which is usually 
fully booked.
There was also lots of activity in the cargo sector, in which FedEx and DHL operate as part of their daily link to their 
central transshipment hubs in Paris and Leipzig. In fact, it was the introduction of a new DHL route in 2020 which 
helped Brno Airport to overcome the challenging coronavirus period.
"Commercial passenger flights obviously remain our top priority. However, cargo flights effectively supplement our 
long-term strategy to make Brno Airport a multi-functional complex for all types of air transport. Naturally, the record 
year in terms of the amount of cargo processed was 2021, since the pandemic encouraged market development for 
this sector. The total amount of cargo handled for 2022 was 11,222 tonnes, a great result for us," concluded Radek 
Lang, BRNO AIRPORT a.s. Head of Transport Operations.

After two pandemic-affected years, passenger numbers are growing again at Bergamo BRNO airport. In 2022, the 
airport handled exactly 471,811 passengers, which represents 153% growth when compared to the pandemic-
affected year of 2021.
The summer months of July and August were the most successful, when the airport saw more than 200,000 
passengers, in doing so surpassing the 'pre-Covid' year of 2019. This year, passengers will be able to fly to 29 
destinations from Brno. New additions include Portugal (Madeira), Albania, and Cape Verde.
The most popular holiday destinations of 2022 included Antalya in Turkey, the Egyptian resorts of Hurghada and 
Marsa Alam, Burgas in Bulgaria, and Heraklion and Rhodes in Greece. That could all change this year, however. 
Travellers will now be able to fly to up to 29 destinations from Brno, six of which are completely new additions. The 
regular route to the Italian city of Bergamo has also been renewed.
"I'm pleased that we have been able to continue to expand the range of flights from Brno and connect it with other 
destinations. As a result, we are expecting a strong season this year and are fully prepared," said Zdenek Soustal, 
board member of AIRPORT BRNO a.s.
Nearly 30 destinations and the return of a regular route to Bergamo
Presales of summer package holidays are approaching their peak and, according to travel agents, people are keen 
to fly from Brno. "At the moment it looks like we're in for another busy summer season at the airport, holidaymakers 
really do have a wide variety of destinations to choose from this year. These new additions include Madeira in 
Portugal, Tirana in Albania, Tivat in Montenegro, with two islands in Cape Verde to be added as well. Not to 
mention the Canary Islands, with one flight a week to Tenerife and now to Fuerteventura, too" explained Radek 
Lang, BRNO AIRPORT a.s. Head of Transport Operations.

IAG mum on TAP privatisation being its "Plan B"
IAG mum on TAP privatisation being its "Plan B"

IAG International Airlines Group has declined to comment on media speculation that it is closely watching the 
pending reprivatisation process of TAP Air Portugal as a possible "Plan B' should its intended 100% acquisition of 
Air Europa (UX, Palma de Mallorca) not meet with European Commission approval.
"We never comment on rumour or speculation," an IAG spokesperson informed ch-aviation.
Spanish business and finance newspaper, Cinco Días, reports the imminent opening of TAP's privatisation process 
has not altered IAG's objective of boosting its Spanish subsidiary Iberia by acquiring all of Air Europa, but, at the 
same time, was keeping a close watch on developments in Lisbon.
As reported, IAG last year converted its EUR100 million euro (USD100 million) loan to Air Europa parent Globalia 
into a 20% stake in the airline. The deal was conditional on Iberia not intervening in the management of Air Europa 
and that both airlines continue to operate independently. However, IAG and Iberia reportedly are negotiating with 
Brussels and Spain's state-owned holding company (Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales - SEPI) to 
take on 100% of Air Europa.
Last month, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary climbed into the speculation ring when he told a news 
conference that IAG was - in his opinion - the most likely to purchase the Portuguese flag carrier. "TAP will end up 
in the hands of British Airways/IAG" rather than with Lufthansa or Air France-KLM, he predicted.
Still, Minister of Economy António José da Costa Silva told Parliament on February 15 that the Spanish were not a 
good fit due to the proximity of the hubs in Lisbon and Madrid.
Global investment advisory firm Evercore ISI has been appointed the transaction advisor for the semi-reprivatisation 
of TAP, which is currently undergoing restructuring as a condition for a EUR3.2 billion (USD3.4 billion) Brussels-
approved state bailout.
The Portuguese government looks to re-privatise at least half of TAP's share capital and reportedly has begun 
discreet discussions with Air France-KLM, Lufthansa Group, and IAG, all three of which have declined to comment.
In 2021, the EC opened an in-depth investigation to assess the proposed acquisition of Air Europa by IAG under 
EU merger regulations. The commission at the time said it was concerned that the proposed transaction could

reduce competition on Spanish domestic routes and on international routes to and from Spain, particularly to South 
America.

 Global airports expect smoother travel this summer as staffing improves, but surging passenger demand during 
peak periods in Europe and North America could still bring long lines, baggage piles and delayed flights, an industry 
group says.  
Airports, airlines and government agencies have been staffing up to avoid crippling labor shortages that curbed 
capacity and led to travel headaches last summer.  
Global passenger demand is expected to recover to pre-pandemic levels on most routes in 2023, placing even 
more pressure on the stretched industry. 
"The summer months are indeed expected to be challenging at times for Europe, North America and some parts of 
Southeast Asia as passenger loads are expected to increase and reach levels in some places close to or even 
above 2019 levels," said Thomas Romig, vice president safety, security and operations at airport trade group ACI 
World.  
But most airport executives gathered at an Airports Council International meeting this week in France's Reunion 
Island forecast any disruption was likely to be during peak traffic periods rather than run for the entire summer 
season, Romig said. 
Amsterdam's Schiphol airport and others might not have enough staff until the end of June, Air France KLM Chief 
Financial Officer Steven Zaat told reporters. 
"Of course we are still impacted by the fact that there's labor shortages everywhere, also at the airport ... but we 
see that gradually operations are actually back on track," he said. 
Low-cost airlines easyJet, Ryanair and Wizz Air posted robust financial results at the start of 2023 on the back of 
very strong forward bookings. Analysts have said that customers are protecting their holidays despite rising inflation 
and recession fears. 
Airports are already taking steps to prepare for high season travel. Earlier this week, Schiphol said it was 
considering reducing the number of passengers it could accept during the May vacation period by around 5%. 
In Canada, Montreal-Trudeau International Airport said it was adding services designed to curb lines ahead of 
spring break, such as bolstering an online booking platform that lets passengers schedule a specific time to pass 
through security checkpoints.  
Airports See Smoother Summer Travel Than 2022 But Brace For Headaches
The country wrestled with long border and security lines at major hubs last summer due to staffing shortages, and 
more recently faced winter weather disruptions.  
Canadian Transport Minister Omar Alghabra discussed spring break preparations during recent meeting with 
airlines and airports, a spokesperson for the office of the minister of transport said.  
"We are actively working to ensure the congestion we saw last summer doesn't happen again," spokesperson 
Nadine Ramadan added.

 Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin[1], has vowed to join 
forces with Russia if Ukraine attacks Belarus. 
In a rare press conference with foreign journalists in the Belarusian capital of Minsk, Lukashenko said Belarus is 
"ready to fight" alongside Russian forces against Ukraine. 
"I'm ready to fight together with the Russians from the territory of Belarus in one case only: if so much as one 
soldier from (Ukraine) comes to our territory with a gun to kill my people," Lukashenko said, The Moscow Times 
reported[2]. 
The Belarusian president also warned other countries allied with Ukraine that their response would be the "most 
cruel" if they launched an attack against his country. 
Despite his repeated threats of joining Russian forces in the conflict, Lukahsneko said, "I do not plan to send my 
people, my soldiers (there)." 
In the borders of the E.U. and Ukraine, Belarusian Special Forces are preparing[3] for a possible escalation of the 
Russian-led war. 
Belarusian forces are simulating forest combat while paratroopers practice jumping from an aircraft. 
"We are ready to fulfill any tasks, including the most difficult ones if we have to," Vadim Lukashevich, the Deputy 
Commander of the Special Operations Forces of Belarus, said. 
In the Belarusian city of Brest, just two miles away from Poland, military officials insist that the situation remains 
stable. But they are also preparing for the worst amidst the "sharply changing conditions." 
Belarusian military staff are estimated to be between 60,000 and 70,000. 
Russia and Belarus grew closer even before the start of the war in Ukraine. 
In the weeks before Russia commenced its "special military operation," the two countries carried out joint military 
exercises close to the border with Ukraine. 
Lukashenko then allowed Russia to make Belarus their staging point before the invasion of Ukraine. 
In October, Lukashenko announced that Belarus was forming a regional joint force with Russia, citing the growing 
tensions on his country's southern border with Ukraine. 
Last month, Russia and Belarus launched joint air force exercises in which every Belarusian military airfield was 
used. 
Belarus 'Ready To Fight' With Russia If Ukraine Attacks Nation, Also Threatens Other Countries
According to the Belarusian Ministry of Defense, the exercises would showcase joint air patrols along their border, 
airborne landings and support operations for ground troops. 
Amid the growing cooperation between the two neighboring countries, Putin denied speculations that he plans to 
absorb Belarus. 
During his visit to Minsk in December, Putin said that Russia and Belarus were "united by a common history and 
spiritual values." 
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarus counterpart Alexander Lukashenko, shown here in Sochi earlier this 
year, will meet for the first time since Belarus forced a Ryanair jet to land in Minsk and arrested an opposition 
activist onboard.Sputnik / Alexei Druzhinin

BA owner IAG to update on recovery ahead of China flight reopening

International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (LSE:IAG), which owns British Airways, is set to provide a keenly 
awaited update on its post-covid recovery tomorrow, with its shares up almost 30% since the start of 2023 but still 
below where they were 12 months ago.
British Airways said in early February it would be reopening routes to mainland China in April, marking a large step 
in the group's recovery after the pandemic grounded the flights for three years.
IAG has been edging towards a return to pre-pandemic passenger figures, reporting steady improvements from 
being 41%, to 18.8% and 14.5% shy of 2019 numbers in the first three quarters of 2022.
The Anglo-Iberian airline group is still only in the "early stages of recovery," according to Liberum analyst Gerald 
Khoo, who said there was growth "headroom" this year, subsequently raising his price target from 145p to 220p.
Deutsche Bank also feels this year is set to be "much better" for airlines than had been envisaged at the end of last 
year, on the back of a strong resurgence in demand and China's reopening.
Adding extra intrigue, there was also some cheeky speculation from Ryanair's boss in January that IAG could bid 
on low-cost carrier easyJet.
Airline stocks have rallied in 2023, with Ryanair and IAG both up close to 25% respectively, lagging the rocketing 
easyJet and Wizz Air, both around 42% higher.
BA owner IAG to update on recovery ahead of China flight reopening
Positive sector news came in the past week from Heathrow, BA's main base, which reported more than double the 
number of passengers flew from the airport in January, just 10% shy of the number seen in 2020.
It added waiting times were also nearing pre-covid levels, despite strikes and ground crew shortages last year, 
likely bringing relief for airlines which faced a cap on flights as a result.
IAG reported an operating profit of (EURO)770mln for the first nine months of 2022, compared to a loss of 
(EURO)2.5bn in the same period in 2021, which was hit by travel restrictions as a result of the pandemic.
It said it aimed to meet 78% of pre-pandemic demand for the full year, eyeing 87% of 2019 footfall in the fourth 
quarter.

EU court rules sanctions for forced landing in Belarus were lawful

Body
Sanctions imposed against the state-owned company responsible for Belarusian airspace over the forced landing of 
a plane in May 2021 are lawful, the EU general court in Luxembourg ruled on Wednesday.
The lower court's decision can be appealed to the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
In May 2021, fighter jets from the Belarus airforce compelled Ryanair Flight FR4978, with more than 100 people on 
board, to land in Minsk on its way from Athens to Vilnius.
Among the passengers was the Belarusian blogger Roman Protasevich, who is critical of the government and co-
founder of the opposition Telegram channel Nexta, and his girlfriend at the time, Sofia Sapega. Both were arrested 
after landing.
The European Union then imposed sanctions, including entry bans and asset freezes.
The state-owned company Belaeronavigatsia, which is responsible for Belarusian airspace, filed a lawsuit 
challenging the sanctions, but was unsuccessful.
The judges said that Belaeronavigatsia "could not reasonably have been unaware" that this action would contribute 
"to the repression of civil society and democratic opposition in Belarus." 
The sanctions were also not disproportionate, the court ruled, as they were issued due to the ongoing disregard for 
human rights and the rule of law in Belarus.

Fares set to rise under EU's new carbon rules Airlines

Airline passengers face higher fares under newly strengthened EU rules designed to tackle aviation emissions in a 
sign that the era of super low-cost flights may be about to end.
The threat of higher fares comes as carriers put up prices to help them recover from the coronavirus pandemic on 
the back of renewed demand after the end of travel restrictions.
The EU wants to force carbonintensive industries to pay more for their pollution with ticket prices rising as much as 
(EURO)10 per return flight because of increased levies on aviation emissions, according to analysts.
EU lawmakers have given initial approval to an update of the bloc's carbon pricing rules, forcing industries including 
aviation to buy enough allowances to cover their pollution under the emissions trading system.
The rules phase out by 2026 the current practice of allowing airlines to obtain a significant proportion of the permits 
they need for free. The total number of allowances in the system will also fall over time, which analysts expect to 
drive up prices.
Olivier Jankovec, director-general of airports industry body ACI Europe, told an industry conference that the EU was 
going through "a major policy reset" that would change "the economics of the sector" and "result in increasing costs 
for airlines, increasing fares and lower demand".
Fares set to rise under EU's new carbon rules Airlines
Airlines for Europe, the lobby group, said that "sustainability legislation such as the EU's ... could see flying via EU 
hubs such as Amsterdam, Paris or Frankfurt becoming about 23 to 29 per cent more expensive in 2035". It said this 
could lead to up to 17 per cent fewer passengers travelling through EU hubs.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has previously said that rising environmental taxes, alongside higher oil prices, 
meant that the era of "absurd[ly]" cheap fares is over.
EasyJet has said it is impossible to predict future prices, but that the industry needed more government support to 
reach net zero. Ryanair last year reported spending (EURO)51mn on credits and said that "in the medium to longer 
term" it would not be able to "eliminate" the impact of the rising cost of allowances by forward hedging.
The price of allowances in the EU system were trading at close to their alltime highs, near (EURO)100 a tonne on 
Friday. Revenues from the ETS will be put towards schemes to boost the use of sustainable aviation fuels.
Europe's emissions trading system is a flagship element of the EU's plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55 
per cent by 2030, compared with 1990 levels.
Environmental groups said the scheme was an effective way to control carbon emissions. "Carbon pricing is an 
essential tool for emissions reduction in Europe ... it's only right that airlines pay their fair share for emissions," said 
Jo Dardenne, aviation director at Transport & Environment, an NGO.
Bas Eickhout, a Green MEP, has pushed for free allowances to be phased out as soon as possible, calling them a 
"fossil fuel subsidy".

Best and worst performing London-listed funds in January - QuotedData
Best and worst performing London-listed funds in January - QuotedData

(Alliance News) - January was a month in which winners far outweighed losers in the investment fund space, 
according to findings from QuotedData on Thursday, with China-exposed investors once again among the best-
performers. 
JPMorgan China Growth & Income was among the best-performing trusts, up over 45% in net asset value terms 
over the three months ended January 31. The fund was boosted by the re-opening of the Chinese economy 
following the relaxation of Beijing's zero-Covid policy.
Aurora Investment Trust PLC was the outright best-performing individual stock by NAV in January alone, however. 
This was driven by big jumps in the share prices of its holdings in easyJet PLC, Ryanair Holdings PLC and Hotel 
Chocolat Group PLC. The investor also benefited from a modest rebound in the share price of its largest position, 
Frasers Group PLC.
In contrast to China, the Indian market lost ground in January, with three of January's worst-performing funds in that 
sector as well as the worst-outright by NAV performance, India Capital Growth Fund Ltd.
Sentiment towards Indian markets was knocked as a short seller attacked one of the nation's largest 
conglomerates, Adani Enterprises Ltd.
Hindenburg Research in January alleged that Adani had used undisclosed related-party transactions and earnings 
manipulation to "maintain the appearance of financial health and solvency" of its listed business units.
Adani has repeatedly denied the allegations and accused the US investment firm of a "maliciously mischievous" 
reputational attack, but nonetheless, its shares have sunk in recent weeks. 
The following were the best and worst performing London-listed investment companies in January, excluding trusts 
with market capitalisations below GBP15 million:

Feb 08, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; 
 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - February 8, 2023 - Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights United 
Airlines UAL[1], Copa Holdings CPA[2], American Airlines AAL[3], Ryanair RYAAY[4] and Delta DAL[5]. 5 Reasons 
Airlines Are Set for a Turbulence-Free 2023Turbulent Times for Airlines It turns out that transporting thousands of 
passengers around the world in a metal tube is no easy task. The airline industry is one of the most complicated 
industries to predict on Wall Street. Like most industries, airlines have inputs and outputs, the sum of which 
ultimately leads to profitability or large losses. Over the past few years, airlines have had to contend with the 
following: 
 A Global Pandemic: Shrank demand to nearly zero and decreased the number of employees. 
 Complex Geopolitical Circumstances: The War in Ukraine drove crude oil prices to near triple digits before pulling 
back last year. 
 Lack of Skilled Employees: Many pilots in the industry aged, some quit, and others were laid off during the 
pandemic. 
 Outdated Airplanes: Supply chain issues and delays due to safety concerns from aircraft manufacturersled to a 
lack of airplanes. 
Despite the many challenges mentioned above, the airline industry is showing signs of life. Clear Skies Ahead? 
Below I will lay out 5 reasons why the tough times experienced by airlines in recent years may finally be over: 
1. A Return to Profitability: International airlines survived massive losses during the pandemic and are now back to 
earning healthy profits. For example, United Airlines lost $28 per share in 2020. In 2022, UAL made $2.50 per 
share. 
Panamanian airline Copa Holdings and other international airlines show a similar EPS trajectory. 
2. Rising EPS Estimates: Airline providers such as American Airlines, Ryanair and United have rising consensus 
estimates moving forward. AAL and UAL also have positive Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) scores suggesting 
that they are likely to surprise earnings to the upside the next time they report. Delta is one of the few airline stocks 
with a negative ESP score. That said, Delta is coming off a blockbuster quarter where EPS rocketed 573%. 
Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: United Airlines, Copa, American Airlines, Ryanair and Delta
4. Recovery to Pre-pandemic Levels: Recently, Boeing Ceo Dave Calhoun confirmed his aspirations to return to 
pre-pandemic aircraft production levels. Airline giants like United are planning to hire thousands of pilots in 2023 to 
increase staff - with no training capacity constraints. Meanwhile, air travel occupancy levels have recovered fully. 
5. Drastically Improving Technical Picture:  
Uptrend Resumed: After five failed attempts to re-take the 200-day moving average in the past two years, the JETS 
ETF decisively broke above the line in 2023 - signaling a distinct change in character. 
Post Earnings Drift Potential / Bull Flags: Because markets are inefficient, stocks tend to trend after reporting stellar 
earnings like most airlines just did. Stocks like UAL rocketed higher in early 2023 and have been consolidating and 
digesting gains in a bullish manner since. Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Since 2000, our top 
stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with 
average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year. Today you can access their live picks without cost or

Feb 07, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Turbulent Times for Airlines 
It turns out that transporting thousands of passengers around the world in a metal tube is no easy task. The airline 
industry is one of the most complicated industries to predict on Wall Street. Like most industries, airlines have 
inputs and outputs, the sum of which ultimately leads to profitability or large losses. Over the past few years, airlines 
have had to contend with the following: 
 A Global Pandemic: Shrank demand to nearly zero and decreased the number of employees. 
 Complex Geopolitical Circumstances:The War in Ukraine drove crude oil prices to near triple digits before pulling 
back last year. 
 Lack of Skilled Employees:Many pilots in the industry aged, some quit, and others were laid off during the 
pandemic. 
 Outdated Airplanes:Supply chain issues and delays due to safety concerns from aircraft manufacturing giant 
Boeing (BA) led to a lack of airplanes. 
Despite the many challenges mentioned above, the airline industry is showing signs of life. The U.S. Global Jets 
ETF JETS[1] is used by investors as a proxy for the industry:

Clear Skies Ahead? 
Below I will lay out 5 reasons why the tough times experienced by airlines in recent years may finally be over: 
1. A Return to Profitability: International airlines survived massive losses during the pandemic and are now back to 
earning healthy profits. For example, United Airlines UAL[2] lost $28 per share in 2020. In 2022, UAL made $2.50 
per share.  
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Panamanian airlineCopa Holdings CPA[3] and other international airlines show a similar EPS trajectory: 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
2. Rising EPS Estimates: Airline providers such as American Airlines AAL[4], Ryanair RYAAY[5], and United 
Airlines have rising consensus estimates moving forward. AAL and UAL also have positive Expected Surprise 
Prediction (ESP) scores suggesting that they are likely to surprise earnings to the upside the next time they report. 
5 Reasons Airlines are Set for a Turbulent-Free 2023
Delta DAL[6] is one of the few airline stocks with a negative ESP score. That said, Delta is coming off a blockbuster 
quarter where EPS rocketed 573%. 
3. Oil Showing Signs of Lagging:The longer oil prices lag, the larger the headwind for the airline industry. Crude oil 
and oil-related stocks are beginning to exhibit relative weakness. For instance, over the past month, the S&P 500 
Index is +9.40% while Exxon Mobil XOM[7] is slightly lower. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
4. Recovery to Pre-pandemic Levels: Recently, Boeing Ceo Dave Calhoun confirmed his aspirations to return to 
pre-pandemic aircraft production levels. Airline giants like United are planning to hire thousands of pilots in 2023 to
