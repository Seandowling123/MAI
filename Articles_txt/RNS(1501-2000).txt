 RYANAIR Q1 PROFITS FALL 21% (AS GUIDED) TO EUR78M
 TRAFFIC RISES 3% TO 23.2M AS FY GUIDANCE IS UNCHANGED.
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost airline (ULCC) today (Jul 29) announced that Q1 profits, as previously guided, 
fell 21% to EUR78m as traffic grew 3% to 23.2m. Ave. fares fell 4% due to the timing of Easter and the impact of 
the June French ATC strikes but revenue per pax. rose 1% due to strong ancillary growth.  Unit costs rose 4% 
mainly due to a 6% increase in fuel costs.  Full year guidance, remains unchanged.

 ---------------------  ----------------  -----------------  -----------
Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
 "As previously guided higher fuel costs and the timing of Easter led to Q1 profits falling EUR21m to 
EUR78m. Ancillary revenues grew by 25% to EUR357m (27% of total revenues) driven by the successful 
development of reserved seating, priority boarding, and higher admin\credit card fees.
 Unit costs rose 4% in line with the increase in sector length.  Fuel increased 6% to EUR577m or 47% of 
total operating costs.  Excluding fuel, Q1 unit costs rose by 6%, slightly faster than the increase in 
sector length, due to a 2% rise in flight crew pay, and increased Eurocontrol, Spanish airport, and 
Italian ATC charges.  We are 90% hedged for FY14 at $980 p.t and 70% hedged for H1 FY15 at $935 p.t.  We 
have extended our H1 FY15 fuel currency hedge on recent dollar weakness which delivers a 3% cut in our 
fuel cost per pax. for the 70% already hedged in H1 FY15.
 Our seven new bases Eindhoven and Maastricht (Holland), Krakow (Poland), Zadar (Croatia), Chania 
(Greece), Marrakesh and Fez (Morocco) are performing well.  We plan to announce more new routes and new 
bases later this year as we exploit significant growth opportunities in markets where competitors 
including Air Berlin, Alitalia, Iberia, LOT, and SAS are cutting back.  We are in ongoing negotiations 
with MAG, the new owners of Stansted airport to reverse six years of record traffic declines, but there is 
no guarantee that any deal will be agreed.
 UK CC Enquiry.
 Despite no evidence of any material influence, and compelling evidence that competition between Ryanair 
and Aer Lingus has intensified (rather than lessened) over the past 61/2 years, we now expect that the 
UKCC will unlawfully attempt to force us to sell down most, if not all, of our 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus 
on some baseless or invented claim that competition in the future "might" be lessened.  Given the CC's 
total lack of evidence they are now reduced to dreaming up bogus future concerns that Ryanair "might" 
prevent another EU airline acquiring Aer Lingus, despite Ryanair's repeated public statements that we 
would consider any offer by another EU airline to acquire Aer Lingus, and/or acquire Ryanair's 
shareholding.
 We have now eliminated any remaining shred of credibility from this enquiry, by offering to 
unconditionally sell our 29.8% stake to any EU airline which offers for, and successfully acquires, over 
50% of Aer Lingus, despite 61/2 years of evidence that no EU airline other than Ryanair has any interest 
in buying, or investing in, Aer Lingus.  The UK CC has no credibility in this case having taken no action 
whatsoever on behalf of UK Consumers in earlier mergers when BA bought BMI or Easyjet bought GB Airways.  
Yet 61/2 years after one Irish airline (Ryanair) bought 29.8% of Aer Lingus (an Irish airline which 
carries very few UK consumers), the UK CC is now ignoring evidence to pursue an apparently pre-meditated 
decision to force a more draconian sell down on Ryanair than they required in the earlier BSkyB/ITN case.   
This is absurd in the case involving 2 Irish airlines when Aer Lingus affects or carries very few UK 
consumers.  Ryanair will strenuously appeal any such ruling, which is clearly unjustified by the evidence 
in this case, and we will insist that any such order cannot be enforced while we appeal the EU 
Commission's February 2013 Prohibition Decision before the EU Courts.
 Aircraft Order and Shareholder Returns.
 Shareholders have recently approved our order for 175 Boeing 737-800 aircraft for delivery over a five 
year period between Sept 2014 and Dec 2018.  This has allowed us to raise our growth targets by 38% to 
110m passengers by FY19 (previously 100m) and our fleet to 410 (previously 375).
 The strength of our Balance Sheet with Q1 gross cash of EUR3.6bn and net cash of EUR191m, (despite 
another recent EUR177m share buyback), remains unmatched in our industry.  This strong cash position 
allied to the Capex certainty we now enjoy, following the recent aircraft order, enabled us to announce 
plans to return up to EUR1bn to shareholders over the next two years.  At least EUR400m via share buybacks 
in FY14, and up to a further EUR600m in special dividends or share buybacks in FY15, subject to current 
fuel, yields and profitability trends continuing.  This further EUR1bn brings to over EUR2.5bn the total 
cash returned to Ryanair shareholders in recent years, which is over 4 times the EUR585m originally raised 
from shareholders since our IPO.
 Outlook.
 We expect Q2 yields to rise despite last year's challenging (post-Olympic) comparables, although yields 
on close-in summer bookings have been slightly weaker in recent weeks due, we believe, to the heat wave in 
Northern Europe.  As ever, our outlook remains cautious for the full year as market conditions are tough 
with recession, austerity, high fuel costs, and excessive Government taxes (most recently in Belgium) 
impacting air travel demand and yields.  While we expect full year traffic to grow 3% to 81.5m, we still 
have no visibility over next winter's yields, and on the basis that the recent yield weakness in close-in 
summer bookings does not continue, we see no reason to change our full year profit after tax guidance 
which remains at between EUR570m to EUR600m".

Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
Certain of the information included in this release is forward looking and is subject to important risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  It is not reasonably possible to itemise all of the 
many factors and specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an airline operating in the European 
economy.  Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results 
are the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for the 
replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., 
European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, weather related 
disruptions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour relations, 
the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the UK, Continental 
Europe, and North Africa the general willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social and political 
factors.
 Ryanair is Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC), operating more than 1,600 daily flights (over 500,000 per 
year) from 57 bases, across 1,600 low fare routes, connecting 180 destinations in 29 countries and operating a fleet 
of 303 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Ryanair has recently announced firm orders for a further 175 new Boeing 
aircraft, which will be delivered between 2014 and 2018. Ryanair currently has a team of more than 9,000 highly 
skilled professionals, will carry over 81.5 million passengers this year and has an outstanding 29-year safety record.

  Attacks on the United States Had a Severe Negative Impact on the International Airline Industry."
 RECENT OPERATING RESULTS
 The Company's profit after tax for the quarter ended June 30, 2014 (the first quarter of the Company's 
2014 fiscal year) was EUR196.8 million, as compared to EUR78.1 million for the corresponding period of the 
previous year. The Company recorded an increase in operating profit, from EUR103.3 million in the first 
quarter of the 2014 fiscal year to EUR231.8 million in the recently completed quarter. Total operating 
revenues increased from EUR1,342.2 million in the first quarter of 2014 to EUR1,495.7 million in the first 
quarter of 2015. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to a 9% increase in average fares and 
a stronger load factor (up 4 points to 86%) and a 2% increase in total operating expenses. Operating 
expenses increased from EUR1,238.9 million in the first quarter of 2014 to EUR1,263.9 million in the first 
quarter of 2015, due primarily to the 2% decrease in fuel costs and an increase in other operating costs 
associated with a higher level of activity in line with the growth of the airline. The Company's cash and 
cash equivalents, restricted cash and financial assets with terms of less than three months amounted to 
EUR4,483.3 million at June 30, 2014 as compared with EUR3,592.7 million at June 30, 2013.
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 The following discussion and analysis of Ryanair's financial condition and results of operations is based 
on its consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 18 and prepared in accordance with 
IFRS.
 The preparation of the Company's financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates.
 The Company believes that its critical accounting policies, which are those that require management's 
most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, are those described in this section. These critical 
accounting policies, the judgments and other uncertainties affecting application of these policies and the 
sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions are factors to be considered in 
reviewing the consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 and the discussion and analysis below. 
For additional detail on these policies, see Note 1, "Basis of preparation and significant accounting 
policies," to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 18.
 Long-lived Assets
 As of March 31, 2014, Ryanair had EUR5.1 billion of long-lived assets, virtually all of which were 
aircraft. In accounting for long-lived assets, Ryanair must make estimates about the expected useful lives 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -37-
of the assets, the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the 
fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate.
 In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft, Ryanair has primarily relied on its 
own and industry experience, recommendations from Boeing, the manufacturer of all of the Company's 
aircraft, valuations from appraisers and other available marketplace information. Subsequent revisions to 
these estimates, which can be significant, could be caused by changes to Ryanair's maintenance program, 
changes in utilization of the aircraft, governmental regulations on aging of aircraft, changes in new 
aircraft technology, changes in governmental and environmental taxes, changes in new aircraft fuel 
efficiency and changing market prices for new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. Ryanair 
evaluates its estimates and assumptions in each reporting period, and, when warranted, adjusts these 
assumptions. Generally, these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis, through depreciation 
expense.
 Ryanair periodically evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment. Factors that would indicate 
potential impairment would include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of 
an aircraft, a significant change in an aircraft's physical condition and operating or cash flow losses 
associated with the use of the aircraft. While the airline industry as a whole has experienced many of 
these factors from time to time, Ryanair has not yet been seriously impacted and continues to record 
positive cash flows from these long-lived assets. Consequently, Ryanair has not yet identified any 
impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet. The Company will continue to monitor its long-lived 
assets and the general airline operating environment.
 The Company's estimate of the recoverable amount of aircraft residual values is 15% of current market 
value of new aircraft, determined periodically, based on independent valuations and actual aircraft 
disposals during prior periods. Aircraft are depreciated over a useful life of 23 years from the date of 
manufacture to residual value.
 Heavy Maintenance
 An element of the cost of an acquired aircraft is attributed, on acquisition, to its service potential, 
reflecting the maintenance condition of the engines and airframe.
 For aircraft held under operating lease agreements, Ryanair is contractually committed to either return 
the aircraft in a certain condition or to compensate the lessor based on the actual condition of the 
airframe, engines and life-limited parts upon return. In order to fulfill such conditions of the lease, 
maintenance, in the form of major airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks, and restitution of major 
life-limited parts, is required to be performed during the period of the lease and upon return of the 
aircraft to the lessor. The estimated airframe and engine maintenance costs and the costs associated with 
the restitution of major life-limited parts, are accrued and charged to profit or loss over the lease term 
for this contractual obligation, based on the present value of the estimated future cost of the major 
airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks and restitution of major life-limited parts, calculated by 
reference to the number of hours flown or cycles operated during the year.
 Ryanair's aircraft operating lease agreements typically have a term of seven years, which closely 
correlates with the timing of heavy maintenance checks. The contractual obligation to maintain and 
replenish aircraft held under operating lease exists independently of any future actions within the 
control of Ryanair. While Ryanair may, in very limited circumstances, sub-lease its aircraft, it remains 
fully liable to perform all of its contractual obligations under the 'head lease' notwithstanding any such 
sub-leasing.
 Both of these elements of accounting policies involve the use of estimates in determining the quantum of 
both the initial maintenance asset and/or the amount of provisions to be recorded and the respective 
periods over which such amounts are charged to income. In making such estimates, Ryanair has primarily 
relied on its own and industry experience, industry regulations and recommendations from Boeing; however, 
these estimates can be subject to revision, depending on a number of factors, such as the timing of the 
planned maintenance, the ultimate utilization of the aircraft, changes to government regulations and 
increases or decreases in estimated costs. Ryanair evaluates its estimates and assumptions in each 
reporting period and, when warranted, adjusts its assumptions, which generally impact maintenance and 
depreciation expense in the income statement on a prospective basis.
 Tax Audits
 Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.  Current tax payable on 
taxable profits is recognised as an expense in the period in which the profits arise using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.  Deferred tax is provided in full, using the 
balance sheet liability method on temporary differences arising from the tax basis of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements.
 Social insurance, passenger taxes and sales taxes are recorded as a liability based on laws enacted in 
the jurisdictions to which they relate. Liabilities are recorded when an obligation has been incurred.
 Ryanair reviews its tax obligations by jurisdiction regularly.  There are many complexities and 
judgements in determining tax obligations due to the inherent complexity of tax law, the manner in which 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -37-
airline businesses are carried out whereby operations can begin and end in different jurisdictions and 
assumptions made about the timing and amount of individual balances to be included in financial statements 
and tax returns.
 Ryanair has an internal tax group and takes professional advice on more complex matters in estimating its 
tax liabilities.  Ryanair also deals extensively with revenue authorities in each jurisdiction in which it 
operates.   Tax liabilities are based on the best estimate of the likely obligation at each reporting 
period.  These estimates are subject to revision based on the outcome of tax audits and discussions with 
revenue authorities that can take several years to conclude.

 Risks Related to Ownership of the Company's Ordinary Shares or ADRs
 EU Rules Impose Restrictions on the Ownership of Ryanair Holdings' Ordinary Shares by Non-EU Nationals, and 
the Company Has Instituted a Ban on the Purchase of Ordinary Shares by Non-EU Nationals. EU Regulation No. 
1008/2008 requires that, in order to obtain and retain an operating license, an EU air carrier must be majority-
owned and effectively controlled by EU nationals. The regulation does not specify what level of share ownership will 
confer effective control on a holder or holders of shares. The Board of Directors of Ryanair Holdings is given certain 
powers under Ryanair Holdings' articles of association (the "Articles") to take action to ensure that the number of 
shares held in Ryanair Holdings by non-EU nationals ("Affected Shares") does not reach a level that could 
jeopardize the Company's entitlement to continue to hold or enjoy the benefit of any license, permit, consent, or 
privilege which it holds or enjoys and which enables it to carry on business as an air carrier. The directors, from 
time to time, set a "Permitted Maximum" on the number of the Company's Ordinary Shares that may be owned by 
non-EU nationals at such level as they believe will comply with EU law. 
The Permitted Maximum is currently set at 49.9%. In addition, under certain circumstances, the directors can take 
action to safeguard the Company's ability to operate by identifying those shares, American Depositary Shares 
("ADSs") or Affected Shares which give rise to the need to take action and treat such shares, the American 
Depositary Receipts ("ADRs") evidencing such ADSs, or Affected Shares as "Restricted Shares." The Board of 
Directors may, under certain circumstances, deprive holders of Restricted Shares of their rights to attend, vote at, 
and speak at general meetings, and/or require such holders to dispose of their Restricted Shares to an EU national 
within as little as 21 days. The directors are also given the power to transfer such shares themselves if a holder fails 
to comply. In 2002, the Company implemented measures to restrict the ability of non-EU nationals to purchase 
Ordinary Shares, and non-EU nationals are currently effectively barred from purchasing Ordinary Shares, and will 
remain so for as long as these restrictions remain in place. There can be no assurance that these restrictions will 
ever be lifted. Additionally, these foreign ownership restrictions could result in Ryanair's exclusion from certain stock 
tracking indices. Any such exclusion may adversely affect the market price of the Ordinary Shares and ADRs. See 
"Item 10. Additional Information-Limitations on Share Ownership by Non-EU Nationals" for a detailed discussion of 
restrictions on share ownership and the current ban on share purchases by non-EU nationals. As of June 30, 2011, 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -21-
EU nationals owned at least 52.7% of Ryanair Holdings' Ordinary Shares (assuming conversion of all outstanding 
ADRs into Ordinary Shares).
 Holders of Ordinary Shares are Currently Unable to Convert those Shares into American Depositary Receipts. In 
an effort to increase the percentage of its share capital held by EU nationals, on June 26, 2001, Ryanair Holdings 
instructed The Bank of New York Mellon, the depositary for its ADR program (the "Depositary"), to suspend the 
issuance of new ADRs in exchange for the deposit of Ordinary Shares until further notice. Holders of Ordinary 
Shares cannot convert their Ordinary Shares into ADRs during this suspension, and there can be no assurance that 
the suspension will ever be lifted. See also "-EU Rules Impose Restrictions on the Ownership of Ryanair Holdings' 
Ordinary Shares by Non-EU nationals and the Company has Instituted a Ban on the Purchase of Ordinary Shares 
by Non-EU Nationals" above.
 The Company's Results of Operations May Fluctuate Significantly. The Company's results of operations have 
varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management expects these variations to continue. See "Item 5. 
Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Seasonal Fluctuations." Among the factors causing these variations 
are the airline industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions, the seasonal nature of air travel, and trends in 
airlines' costs, especially fuel costs. Because a substantial portion of airline travel (both business and personal) is 
discretionary, the industry tends to experience adverse financial results during general economic downturns. The 
Company is substantially dependent on discretionary air travel.
 The trading price of Ryanair Holdings' Ordinary Shares and ADRs may be subject to wide fluctuations in response 
to quarterly variations in the Company's operating results and the operating results of other airlines. In addition, the 
global stock markets from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that affect the market 
prices of many airline company stocks. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of 
the Ordinary Shares and ADRs.
 Ryanair Holdings May or May Not Pay Dividends. Since its incorporation as the holding company for Ryanair in 
1996, Ryanair Holdings has only once declared or paid dividends on its Ordinary Shares. The directors of the 
Company declared on June 1, 2010 that Ryanair Holdings intended to pay a special dividend of EUR500 million, 
and following shareholder approval at its annual general meeting on September 22, 2010 this special dividend was 
paid on October 1, 2010. The Company also indicated in the same announcement that it may pay a further dividend 
of up to EUR500 million before the end of fiscal year 2013, subject to, amongst other things, its continued 
profitability and the absence of further aircraft purchases or any other significant capital expenditures. The 
Company may ultimately determine not to pay any such dividend, or may fail to obtain shareholder approval (where 
required). The Company may pay other dividends from time to time, or it may not pay any dividends at all, as has 
been its general practice to date. No assurances can be given that the Company will, or will not, pay dividends. See 
"Item 8. Financial Information-Other Financial Information-Dividend Policy." As a holding company, Ryanair 
Holdings does not have any material assets other than the shares of Ryanair.
 Item 4. Information on the Company
 INTRODUCTION
 Ryanair Holdings was incorporated in 1996 as a holding company for Ryanair Limited. The latter operates a low-
fares, scheduled-passenger airline serving short-haul, point-to-point routes between Ireland, the U.K., Continental 
Europe, and Morocco. Incorporated in 1984, Ryanair Limited began to introduce a low-fares operating model under 
a new management team in the early 1990s. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and 
Prospects[3/4]History." At June 30, 2011, with its operating fleet of 272 Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft, 
Ryanair Limited offered approximately 1,550 scheduled short-haul flights per day serving approximately 160 
airports largely throughout Europe. See "[3/4]Route System, Scheduling and Fares[3/4]Route System and 
Scheduling" for more details of Ryanair's route network. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and 
Prospects[3/4]Seasonal Fluctuations" for information about the seasonality of Ryanair's business.
 Ryanair recorded a profit on ordinary activities after taxation of EUR374.6 million in the 2011 fiscal year, as 
compared to a profit on ordinary activities after taxation of EUR305.3 million in the 2010 fiscal year. This increase 
was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues of approximately 22% from EUR2,988.1 million to EUR3,629.5 
million, partially offset by an increase in fuel costs of approximately 37% from EUR893.9 million to EUR1,227.0 
million. Ryanair generated an average booked passenger load factor of approximately 82.6% and average 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -21-
scheduled passenger revenues of EUR0.068 per ASM in the 2011 fiscal year. The Company has focused on 
maintaining low operating costs (EUR0.049 per ASM in the 2011 fiscal year).
 The market's acceptance of Ryanair's low-fares service is reflected in the "Ryanair Effect" - Ryanair's history of 
stimulating significant annual passenger traffic growth on the new routes on which it has commenced service since 
1991. For example, on the basis of the "U.K. Airports Annual Statement of Movements, Passengers and Cargo" 
published by the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority and statistics released by the International Civil Aviation Organization 
(the "ICAO"), the number of scheduled airline passengers traveling between Dublin and London increased from 1.7 
million passengers in 1991 to 3.5 million passengers in the 2010 calendar year. Most international routes Ryanair 
has begun serving since 1991 have recorded significant traffic growth in the period following Ryanair's 
commencement of service, with Ryanair capturing the largest portion of such growth on each such route. A variety 
of factors contributed to this increase in air passenger traffic, including the relative strength of the Irish, U.K., and 
European economies in past years. However, management believes that the most significant factors driving such 
growth across all its European routes have been Ryanair's low-fares policy and its superiority to its competitors in 
terms of flight punctuality, levels of lost baggage, and rates of flight cancellations.
 The address of Ryanair Holdings' registered office is: c/o Ryanair Limited, Corporate Head Office, Dublin Airport, 
County Dublin, Ireland. The Company's contact person regarding this Annual Report is: Howard Millar, Deputy 
Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer (same address as above). The telephone number is +353-1-812-1212 
and the facsimile number is +353-1-812-1213. Under its current Articles, Ryanair Holdings has an unlimited 
corporate duration.

 Emissions Trading. On November 19, 2008, the European Council of Ministers adopted legislation to add aviation 
to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme as of 2012. This scheme, which has thus far applied mainly to energy 
producers, is a cap-and-trade system for CO(2) emissions to encourage industries to improve their CO(2) 
efficiency. Under the legislation, airlines were granted initial CO(2) allowances based on historical "revenue ton 
kilometers" and a CO(2) efficiency benchmark. Any shortage of allowances has to be purchased in the open market 
and/or at government auctions. The Company has estimated its carbon credit requirements in respect of 2012 and 
has hedged its exposures at a cost of approximately EUR10 to EUR15 million. Management believes that this 
legislation is likely to have a negative impact on the European airline industry.  Ryanair takes its environmental 
responsibilities seriously and intends to continue to improve its environmental efficiency and to minimize emissions.
 Aviation Taxes. Ryanair is fundamentally opposed to the introduction of any aviation taxes, including any 
environmental taxes, fuel taxes or emissions levies. Ryanair has and continues to offer the lowest fares in Europe, 
to make passenger air travel affordable and accessible to European consumers. Ryanair believes that the 
imposition of additional taxes on airlines will not only increase airfares, but will discourage new entrants into the 
market, resulting in less choice for consumers. Ryanair believes this would ultimately have adverse effects on the 
European economy in general. There is in particular no justification for any environmental taxes on aviation 
following the introduction of the Emissions Trading Scheme for airlines.
 As a company, Ryanair believes in free market competition and that the imposition of aviation taxation would favor 
the less efficient flag carriers - which generally have smaller and older aircraft, lower load factors, and a much 
higher fuel burn per passenger, and which operate primarily into congested airports - and reduce competition. 
Furthermore, the introduction of a tax at a European level only would distort competition between airlines operating 
solely within Europe and those operating also outside of Europe. We believe that the introduction of such a tax 
would also be incompatible with international law. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Introduction of New or 
Increases in Existing Aviation Taxes Could Increase Costs."
 Airport charges
 The EU Airport Charges Directive of March 2009 sets forth general principles that are to be followed by airports 
with more than five million passenger per annum, and all capital city airports irrespective of their passenger 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -33-
throughput, when setting airport charges, and provides for an appeals procedure for airlines in the event they are 
not satisfied with the level of charges. However, Ryanair does not believe that this procedure will be effective or that 
it will constrain those airports that are currently abusing their dominant position, in part because the legislation was 
mis-transposed in certain countries, such as Ireland, so as to deprive airlines of even the basic safeguards provided 
for in the Directive. This legislation may in fact lead to higher airport charges, depending on how its provisions are 
applied by EU member states and subsequently by the courts.
 Slots
 Currently, the majority of Ryanair's bases of operations have no "slot" allocation restrictions; however, traffic at a 
substantial number of the airports Ryanair serves, including its primary bases, are regulated by means of "slot" 
allocations, which represent authorizations to take off or land at a particular airport within a specified time period. In 
addition, EU law currently regulates the acquisition, transfer, and loss of slots. Applicable EU regulations currently 
prohibit the buying or selling of slots for cash. The European Commission adopted a regulation in April 2004 
(Regulation (EC) No. 793/2004) that made some minor amendments to the current allocation system, allowing for 
limited transfers of, but not trading in, slots. Slots may be transferred from one route to another by the same carrier, 
transferred within a group or as part of a change of control of a carrier, or swapped between carriers. In April 2008, 
the European Commission issued a communication on the application of the slot allocation regulation, signaling the 
acceptance of secondary trading of airport slots between airlines. This is expected to allow more flexibility and 
mobility in the use of slots and will further enhance possibilities for market entry at slot constrained airports. Any 
future legislation that might create an official secondary market for slots could create a potential source of revenue 
for certain of Ryanair's current and potential competitors, many of which have many more slots allocated at primary 
airports at present than Ryanair. The European Union is currently considering such proposals as part of a review of 
the slots legislation announced in December 2011. Slot values depend on several factors, including the airport, time 
of day covered, the availability of slots and the class of aircraft. Ryanair's ability to gain access to and develop its 
operations at slot-controlled airports will be affected by the availability of slots for takeoffs and landings at these 
specific airports. New entrants to an airport are currently given certain privileges in terms of obtaining slots, but 
such privileges are subject to the grandfathered rights of existing operators that are utilizing their slots. While 
Ryanair generally seeks to avoid slot-controlled airports, there is no assurance that Ryanair will be able to obtain a 
sufficient number of slots at the slot-controlled airports that it desires to serve in the future at the time it needs them 
or on acceptable terms.
 Other
 Health and occupational safety issues relating to the Company are largely addressed in Ireland by the Safety, 
Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 and other regulations under that act. Although licenses or permits are not 
issued under such legislation, compliance is monitored by the Health and Safety Authority (the "Authority"), which is 
the regulating body in this area. The Authority periodically reviews Ryanair's health and safety record and when 
appropriate, issues improvement notices or prohibition notices. Ryanair has responded to all such notices to the 
satisfaction of the Authority. Other safety issues are covered by the Irish Aviation Orders, which may vary from time 
to time.
 The Company's operations are subject to the general laws of Ireland and, insofar as they are applicable in Ireland, 
the laws of the EU. The Company may also become subject to additional regulatory requirements in the future. The 
Company is also subject to local laws and regulations at locations where it operates and the regulations of various 
local authorities that operate the airports it serves.
 DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY
 For certain information about each of the Company's key facilities, see "-Facilities" above. Management believes 
that the Company's facilities are suitable for its needs and are well maintained.

Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -33-
 HISTORY
 Ryanair's current business strategy dates to the early 1990s, when a new management team, including the current 
chief executive, commenced the restructuring of Ryanair's operations to become a low-fares airline based on the 
low-cost operating model pioneered by Southwest Airlines Co. in the United States. During the period between 
1992 and 1994, Ryanair expanded its route network to include scheduled passenger services between Dublin and 
Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow (Prestwick). In 1994, Ryanair began standardizing its fleet by purchasing 
used Boeing 737-200A aircraft to replace substantially all of its leased aircraft. Beginning in 1996, Ryanair 
continued to expand its service from Dublin to new provincial destinations in the U.K. In August 1996, Irish Air, L.P., 
an investment vehicle led by David Bonderman and certain of his associates at the Texas Pacific Group, acquired a 
minority interest in the Company. Ryanair Holdings completed its initial public offering in June 1997.
 From 1997 through June 30, 2012, Ryanair launched service on more than 1,500 routesthroughout Europe and 
also increased the frequency of service on a number of its principal routes. During that period, in addition to Dublin, 
Ryanair established 51 airports as bases of operations. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-Route System, 
Scheduling and Fares" for a list of these bases. Ryanair has increased the number of booked passengers from 4.9 
million in the 1999 fiscal year to approximately 75.8 million in the 2012 fiscal year. Ryanair had 294 Boeing 737-800 
aircraft as of June 30, 2012, and now serves approximately 160 airports with a team of over 8,500 people.
 Ryanair expects to have 305 aircraft in its operating fleet by March 31, 2013. During the period through March 
2014, the Company may hand back up to four Boeing 737-800 aircraft, as leases mature, thereby reducing the size 
of the Company's fleet to 301 aircraft. See "[3/4]Liquidity and Capital Resources" and "Item 4. Information on the 
Company[3/4]Aircraft" for additional details.
 BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 Since Ryanair pioneered its ultra low cost operating model in Europe in the early 1990s, its passenger volumes 
and scheduled passenger revenues have increased significantly because it has substantially increased capacity 
and demand has been sufficient to match the increased capacity. Ryanair's annual booked passenger volume has 
grown from approximately 945,000 passengers in the calendar year 1992 to approximately 75.8 million passengers 
in the 2012 fiscal year.

 Currently, the majority of Ryanair's bases of operations have no "slot" allocations; however, traffic at a substantial 
number of the airports Ryanair serves, including its primary bases, are regulated by means of "slot" allocations, 
which represent authorizations to take off or land at a particular airport within a specified time period. In addition, 
EU law currently regulates the acquisition, transfer, and loss of slots. Applicable EU regulations currently prohibit 
the buying or selling of slots for cash. The European Commission adopted a regulation in April 2004 (Regulation 
(EC) No. 793/2004) that made some minor amendments to the current allocation system, allowing for limited 
transfers of, but not trading in, slots. Slots may be transferred from one route to another by the same carrier, 
transferred within a group or as part of a change of control of a carrier, or swapped between carriers. In April 2008, 
the European Commission issued a communication on the application of the slot allocation regulation, signaling the 
acceptance of secondary trading of airport slots between airlines. 
This is expected to allow more flexibility and mobility in the use of slots and will further enhance possibilities for 
market entry. Any future proposals that might create a secondary market for the auction of slots or allow trading of 
slots among airlines could create a potential source of revenue for certain of Ryanair's current and potential 
competitors, many of which have many more slots allocated at present than Ryanair. Slot values depend on several 
factors, including the airport, time of day covered, the availability of slots and the class of aircraft. Ryanair's ability to 
gain access to and develop its operations at slot-controlled airports will be affected by the availability of slots for 
takeoffs and landings at these specific airports. New entrants to an airport are currently given certain privileges in 
terms of obtaining slots, but such privileges are subject to the grandfathered rights of existing operators that are 
utilizing their slots. While Ryanair generally seeks to avoid slot-controlled airports, there is no assurance that 
Ryanair will be able to obtain a sufficient number of slots at the slot-controlled airports that it desires to serve in the 
future at the time it needs them or on acceptable terms.
 Other
 Health and occupational safety issues relating to the Company are largely addressed in Ireland by the Safety, 
Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989; the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations, 
1993; and other regulations under that act. Although licenses or permits are not issued under such legislation, 
compliance is monitored by the Health and Safety Authority (the "Authority"), which is the regulating body in this 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -32-
area. The Authority periodically reviews Ryanair's health and safety record and when appropriate, issues 
improvement notices or prohibition notices. Ryanair has responded to all such notices to the satisfaction of the 
Authority. Other safety issues are covered by the Irish Aviation Orders, which may vary from time to time.
 The Company's operations are subject to the general laws of Ireland and, insofar as they are applicable in Ireland, 
the laws of the EU. The Company may also become subject to additional regulatory requirements in the future. The 
Company is also subject to local laws and regulations at locations where it operates and the regulations of various 
local authorities that operate the airports it serves.
 DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY
 For certain information about each of the Company's key facilities, see "-Facilities" above. Management believes 
that the Company's facilities are suitable for its needs and are well maintained.
 Item 4A. Unresolved Staff Comments
 There are no unresolved staff comments.
 Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the 
Company and the notes thereto included in Item 18. Those consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRS.
 HISTORY
 Ryanair's current business strategy dates to the early 1990s, when a new management team, including the current 
chief executive, commenced the restructuring of Ryanair's operations to become a low-fares airline based on the 
low-cost operating model pioneered by Southwest Airlines Co. in the United States. During the period between 
1992 and 1994, Ryanair expanded its route network to include scheduled passenger services between Dublin and 
Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow (Prestwick). In 1994, Ryanair began standardizing its fleet by purchasing 
used Boeing 737-200A aircraft to replace substantially all of its leased aircraft. Beginning in 1996, Ryanair 
continued to expand its service from Dublin to new provincial destinations in the U.K. In August 1996, Irish Air, L.P., 
an investment vehicle led by David Bonderman and certain of his associates at the Texas Pacific Group, acquired a 
minority interest in the Company. Ryanair Holdings completed its initial public offering in June 1997.
 From 1997 through June 30, 2011, Ryanair launched service on more than 1,300 routesthroughout Europe and 
also increased the frequency of service on a number of its principal routes. During that period, in addition to Dublin, 
Ryanair established 44 airports as bases of operations. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-Route System, 
Scheduling and Fares" for a list of these bases. Ryanair has increased the number of booked passengers from 4.9 
million in the 1999 fiscal year to approximately 72.1 million in the 2011 fiscal year. Ryanair had 272 Boeing 737-800 
aircraft as of June 30, 2011, and now serves approximately 160 airports with a team of over 8,500 people.
 Ryanair expects to have 294 aircraft in its operating fleet by March 31, 2012. During the period through March 
2013, the Company expects to take delivery of additional Boeing 737-800 aircraft that, net of planned retirements 
and lease terminations, are expected to increase the size of the Company's fleet to 299 aircraft. See "[3/4]Liquidity 
and Capital Resources" and "Item 4. Information on the Company[3/4]Aircraft" for additional details.
 BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 Since Ryanair pioneered its low-fares operating model in Europe in the early 1990s, its passenger volumes and 
scheduled passenger revenues have increased significantly because it has substantially increased capacity and 
demand has been sufficient to match the increased capacity. Ryanair's annual booked passenger volume has 
grown from approximately 945,000 passengers in the calendar year 1992 to approximately 72.1 million passengers 
in the 2011 fiscal year.
 Ryanair's revenue passenger miles ("RPMs") increased approximately 19% from 44,841.1 million in the 2010 fiscal 
year to 53,256.9 million in the 2011 fiscal year due primarily to an increase of approximately 19% in scheduled 
available seat miles ("ASMs") from 53,469.6 million in the 2010 fiscal year to 63,358.3 million in the 2011 fiscal 
year. Scheduled passenger revenues increased approximately 22% from EUR2,324.5 million in the 2010 fiscal year 
to EUR2,827.9 million in the 2011 fiscal year. Average yield per RPM was EUR0.052 in the 2010 fiscal year and 
EUR0.053 in the 2011 fiscal year. The slight increase in average yield per RPM in the 2011 fiscal year was 
principally attributable to a combination of longer sector length and a better selection of new routes and bases.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -32-
 Expanding passenger volumes and capacity, high load factors and aggressive cost containment have enabled 
Ryanair to continue to generate operating profits despite increasing price competition and increases in certain 
costs. Ryanair's total break-even load factor was 73% in the 2010 fiscal year and 72% in the 2011 fiscal year. Cost 
per ASM was EUR0.047 in the 2010 fiscal year and EUR0.049 in the 2011 fiscal year, with the increase primarily 
reflecting the higher fuel cost per ASM of EUR0.019 in the 2011 fiscal year, as compared to EUR0.017 in the 2010 
fiscal year, as well as an increase of approximately 19% in ASMs in the 2011 fiscal year. Ryanair recorded 
operating profits of EUR402.1 million in the 2010 fiscal year and EUR488.2 million in the 2011 fiscal year. The 
Company recorded a profit after taxation of EUR305.3 million in the 2010 fiscal year and profit after taxation of 
EUR374.6 million in the 2011 fiscal year. Ryanair recorded seat capacity growth of approximately 8% in the 2011 
fiscal year, compared to approximately 12% in the 2010 fiscal year, and expects capacity to increase by 
approximately 5% in the 2012 fiscal year. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Ryanair Has Decided to 
Seasonally Ground Aircraft."
 Investment in Aer Lingus
 The Company owns 29.8% of Aer Lingus, which it acquired in fiscal years 2007, 2008 and 2009 at a total cost of 
EUR407.2 million. Following the approval of its shareholders, management proposed in the 2007 fiscal year to 
effect a tender offer to acquire the entire share capital of Aer Lingus. This 2006 offer was, however, prohibited by 
the European Commission on competition grounds in June 2007. Ryanair's management viewed the acquisition of 
Aer Lingus in the context of the overall trend of consolidation among airlines in Europe and believed that the 
acquisition would lead to the formation of one strong Irish airline group able to compete with large carriers such as 
Lufthansa, Air France/KLM and British Airways/Iberia (now "International Airlines Group"). During the EU 
competition review, the Company made a commitment that if the acquisition was approved, Ryanair would eliminate 
Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges and reduce its fares, which would have resulted in Aer Lingus passengers saving 
approximately EUR100 million per year. The Company was thus surprised and disappointed by the European 
Commission's decision to prohibit this offer. This decision was the first adverse decision taken in respect of any EU 
airline merger and the first-ever adverse decision in respect of a proposed merger of two companies with less than 
5% of the EU market for their services.

Body
 On September 6, 2005, the European Commission announced new guidelines on the financing of airports and 
start-up aid to airlines by regional airports based on its February 2004 finding in the Charleroi case, a decision that 
the Court of First Instance ("CFI") has since annulled in December 2008. The guidelines only apply to publicly 
owned regional airports, and place restrictions on the incentives that these airports can offer airlines to deliver 
traffic. Ryanair believes that the CFI's annulment of the Charleroi decision severely undermines these guidelines. In 
April 2011, the European Commission launched a consultation on the revision of the 2005 guidelines. In May 2013, 
the European Commission launched a further consultation on the revision of the 2005 guidelines, a final revised 
version of which is expected to be published in the second half of 2013. However, no assurance can be given that 
the revised guidelines will better reflect the commercial reality of the liberalized air transport market and 
consequently allow public airports to offer similar incentives to those offered by private airports.
 The European Union also adopted legislation on airport charges (EU Directive 2009/12), which was originally 
intended to address abusive pricing at monopoly airports. However, the legislation includes all European airports 
with over five million passengers per year. Management believes that this will likely increase the administrative 
burdens on smaller airports and may lead to higher airport charges, while the scope that exists within this Directive 
to address abuses of their dominant positions by Europe's larger airports is very limited. See "Item 7. Major 
Shareholders and Related-Party Transactions 3/4Other Financial Information3/4Legal Proceedings3/4EU State Aid-
Related Proceedings."
 The European Union also passed legislation calling for increased transparency in airline fares, which requires the 
inclusion of all mandatory taxes, fees, and charges in advertised prices. Ryanair currently includes this information 
in its advertised fares in all markets where it operates. However, certain regulatory authorities have alleged that 
some fees applied by airlines, including Ryanair, on an avoidable basis are in fact mandatory. Ryanair amended its 
website to include information on fees in June 2012 and incorporated further changes to meet these requirements 
on its website in August 2012 and December 2012.
 Registration of Aircraft
 Pursuant to the Irish Aviation Authority (Nationality and Registration of Aircraft) Order 2002 (the "Order"), the IAA 
regulates the registration of aircraft in Ireland. In order to be registered or continue to be registered in Ireland, an 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -31-
aircraft must be wholly owned by either (i) a citizen of Ireland or a citizen of another member state of the EU having 
a place of residence or business in Ireland or (ii) a company registered in and having a place of business in Ireland 
and having its principal place of business in Ireland or another member state of the EU and not less than two-thirds 
of the directors of which are citizens of Ireland or of another member state of the EU. As of the date of this report, 
nine of the ten directors of Ryanair Holdings are citizens of Ireland or of another member state of the EU. An aircraft 
will also fulfill these conditions if it is wholly owned by such citizens or companies in combination. Notwithstanding 
the fact that these particular conditions may not be met, the IAA retains discretion to register an aircraft in Ireland so 
long as it is in compliance with the other conditions for registration under the Order. Any such registration may, 
however, be made subject to certain conditions. In order to be registered, an aircraft must also continue to comply 
with any applicable provisions of Irish law. The registration of any aircraft can be cancelled if it is found that it is not 
in compliance with the requirements for registration under the Order and, in particular: (i) if the ownership 
requirements are not met; (ii) if the aircraft has failed to comply with any applicable safety requirements specified by 
the IAA in relation to the aircraft or aircraft of a similar type; or (iii) if the IAA decides in any case that it is not in the 
public interest for the aircraft to remain registered in Ireland.
 Regulation of Competition
 Competition/Antitrust Law. It is a general principle of EU competition law that no agreement may be concluded 
between two or more separate economic undertakings that prevents, restricts or distorts competition in the common 
market or any part of the common market. Such an arrangement may nevertheless be exempted by the European 
Commission, on either an individual or category basis. The second general principle of EU competition law is that 
any business or businesses having a dominant position in the EU common market or any substantial part of the 
common market may not abuse such dominant position. Ryanair is subject to the application of the general rules of 
EU competition law as well as specific rules on competition in the airline sector.
 An aggrieved person may sue for breach of EU competition law in the courts of a member state and/or petition the 
European Commission for an order to put an end to the breach of competition law. The European Commission also 
may impose fines and daily penalties on businesses and the courts of the member states may award damages and 
other remedies (such as injunctions) in appropriate circumstances.
 Competition law in Ireland is primarily embodied in the Competition Act 2002. This Act is modeled on the EU 
competition law system. The Irish rules generally prohibit anti-competitive arrangements among businesses and 
prohibit the abuse of a dominant position. These rules are enforced either by public enforcement (primarily by the 
Competition Authority) through both criminal and civil sanctions or by private action in the courts. These rules apply 
to the airline sector, but are subject to EU rules that override any contrary provisions of Irish competition law. 
Ryanair has been subject to an abuse-of-dominance investigation by the Irish Competition Authority in relation to 
service between Dublin and Cork. The Competition Authority closed its investigation in July 2009 with a finding in 
favor of Ryanair.
 State Aid. The EU rules control aid granted by member states to businesses on a selective or discriminatory basis. 
The EU Treaty prevents member states from granting such aid unless approved in advance by the EU. Any such 
grant of state aid to an airline is subject to challenge before the EU or, in certain circumstances, national courts. If 
aid is held to have been unlawfully granted it may have to be repaid by the airline to the granting member state, 
together with interest thereon. See "Item 3. Key Information3/4Risk Factors3/4Risks Related to the Company-The 
Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings Alleging State Aid at Certain Airports"and "Item 8. Financial 
Information3/4Other Financial Information3/4Legal Proceedings."
 Environmental Regulation
 Aircraft Noise Regulations. Ryanair is subject to international, national and, in some cases, local noise regulation 
standards. EU and Irish regulations have required that all aircraft operated by Ryanair comply with Stage 3 noise 
requirements since April 1, 2002. All of Ryanair's aircraft currently comply with these regulations. Certain airports in 
the U.K. (including London Stansted and London Gatwick) and continental Europe have established local noise 
restrictions, including limits on the number of hourly or daily operations or the time of such operations.
 Company Facilities. Environmental controls are generally imposed under Irish law through property planning 
legislation, specifically the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts of 1963 to 1999, the Planning and 
Development Act 2000 and regulations made there under. At Dublin Airport, Ryanair operates on land controlled by 
the DAA. Planning permission for its facilities has been granted in accordance with both the zoning and planning 
requirements of Dublin Airport. There is also specific Irish environmental legislation implementing applicable EU 
directives and regulations, to which Ryanair adheres. From time to time, noxious or potentially toxic substances are 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -31-
held on a temporary basis within Ryanair's engineering facilities at Dublin Airport, Glasgow (Prestwick), London 
(Stansted), Frankfurt (Hahn), Stockholm (Skavsta), Oslo (Rygge) and Kaunas. However, at all times Ryanair's 
storage and handling of these substances complies with the relevant regulatory requirements. At Ryanair's 
Glasgow (Prestwick) and London (Stansted) maintenance facilities, all normal waste is removed in accordance with 
the Environmental Protection Act of 1996 and Duty of Care Waste Regulations. For special waste removal, Ryanair 
operates under the Special Waste Regulations 1998. At all other facilities Ryanair adheres to all local and EU 
regulations.
 Ryanair's Policy on Noise and Emissions. Ryanair is committed to reducing emissions and noise through 
investments in "next generation" aircraft and engine technologies and the implementation of certain operational and 
commercial decisions to minimize the environmental impact of its operations. According to the Air Travel Carbon 
and Energy Efficiency Report published by Brighter Planet, Ryanair is the industry leader in terms of environmental 
efficiency, and the Company is constantly working towards improving its performance.

 RYANAIR FULL YEAR PROFITS UP 13% TO EUR569M
 TRAFFIC UP 5% TO 79M, NEW AIRCRAFT ORDER UNDERPINS GROWTH
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier (ULCC) today (May 20) announced (record) annual profits of 
EUR569m, up 13% on last year despite higher oil costs. Revenues rose 13% to EUR4.88bn as traffic grew 5% to 
79.3m passengers. Unit costs rose 8% mainly due to an 18% (EUR292m) increase in fuel. Excluding fuel unit costs 
rose by 3%, while avg. fares improved by 6%.

Announcing these profits Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, said:
 The highlights of the past financial year include:-
 --    Profits grew by 13% to EUR569m.
 --    Traffic grew 5% to 79.3m (despite grounding up to 80 winter aircraft).
 --    7 new bases - Chania (Greece), Eindhoven (Netherlands), Fez (Morocco), Krakow (Poland), Maastricht 
(Netherlands), Marrakech (Morocco) & Zadar (Croatia).
 --    217 new routes (y/e total over 1,600 routes).
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
 --    15 new aircraft delivered (y/e fleet 305).
 --    2nd special div. of EUR492m and EUR68m share buyback completed.
 --    175 new aircraft order, delivery 2014 to 2018 (sub. to June 18 EGM approval).
 Delivering a 13% increase in profits and 5% traffic growth despite high oil prices during a European 
recession is testimony to the strength of Ryanair's ultra-low cost model.  Fuel costs rose by over 
EUR290m, and now represent 45% of total costs.  Excluding fuel, unit costs were up 3% due to excessive and 
unjustified increases in Italian ATC, Eurocontrol and Spanish airport fees.  Ancillary revenues outpaced 
traffic growth, rising 20% to EUR1,064m or 22% of total revenue.
 Growth - New Routes and Bases
 This summer Ryanair opened 7 new bases, and more than 200 new routes as we continue our strategy of 
growing Europe's largest passenger airline.  However with 9 (net) additional aircraft and longer sectors, 
traffic growth this summer will be very modest at approx. 2%.  By grounding fewer aircraft next winter we 
expect to deliver slightly faster H2 monthly growth which should result in overall traffic growth for the 
full year rising by more than 2m to 81.5m passengers.
 Forward bookings on our new routes and bases this summer are ahead of expectations (albeit at modest 
yields) as competitor airlines continue to restructure and cut short-haul capacity.  We expect growth 
opportunities for Ryanair to expand and improve for the foreseeable future.
 Our new route teams continue to handle more growth opportunities than our current fleet expansion allows. 
Significant opportunities are opening up in Germany, Scandinavia and central Europe in particular, where 
Air Berlin, SAS and LOT continue to restructure.  We are in active discussions with the new owners of 
Stansted Airport and the new management at Dublin Airport and while no agreements have yet been reached, 
if a competitive cost base emerges, then we could restart growth at one or other airports as early as 
September 2013.
 We have also made offers to the Spanish airport monopoly AENA to reverse a significant proportion of its 
traffic declines over the past two years.  In a country where youth unemployment runs at 50%, their policy 
of increasing airport fees, while traffic declined from 220m to 180m over the past six years is plainly 
ill-judged.  As ever, Ryanair remains willing to exploit growth opportunities wherever airports provide 
attractive incentives to do so.
 Market Share Gains
 Ryanair continues to expand, making meaningful share gains in many of Europe's largest markets.  In 
addition to being the No. 1 passenger airline in Ireland, and Spain, we have in the last 12 months 
overtaken Alitalia and LOT to become Italy's and Poland's No. 1 airline, respectively.  Ryanair believes 
that its unique low cost advantage will enable the airline to achieve a 20% share of the European short-
haul market over the next 5 years, particularly given that many of Europe's high fare incumbents are 
restructuring and cutting capacity.
 New 175 Aircraft Order
 Ryanair's successful growth, allied to deep short-haul restructuring among many high fare competitors, 
gives us confidence that we can grow from 80m p.a. to over 100m passengers p.a. over the next 5 years.  
Our recent order for 175 firm B 737-800 aircraft represents an enormous opportunity for shareholders as 
Ryanair returns to higher rates (5% p.a.) of traffic growth.  We are pleased to have reached acceptable  
pricing with Boeing, and the controlled delivery programme from Autumn 2014 to end of 2018 will provide 
the opportunity to expand Ryanair's fleet to over 400 aircraft and our traffic to over 100m p.a.  Ryanair 
is now uniquely positioned to offer many of Europe's airports sustained traffic growth in return for low 
cost, efficient facilities.  I am confident that in time this new order will enable Ryanair to extend its 
traffic leadership over Europe's airlines, and generate further returns for our shareholders.
 Aer Lingus
 We were disappointed that the European Commission in February 2013 decided to prohibit Ryanair's third 
offer for Aer Lingus.  It is bizarre that the EU can wave through BA's offer for British Midland in Phase 
1 with few remedies, yet months later reject Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus which was accompanied by a 
revolutionary remedies package delivering two upfront buyers to open competing bases in Dublin and Cork 
airports.  We have no doubt that this was yet another politically motivated decision by Europe's 
competition authority and it is inexplicable in the context of its stated policy of promoting European 
airline consolidation.
 Having our third offer for Aer Lingus prohibited by the EU Commission on the grounds that "competition 
between Ryanair and Aer Lingus has intensified since 2007", our shareholding is now the subject of an even 
more bizarre regulatory inquiry in the UK where the Competition Commission are reviewing our 61/2 year old 
minority stake in Aer Lingus on the basis that it may have "lessened competition" between Ryanair and Aer 
Lingus.  Given that the UK Competition Commission has a legal duty of sincere co-operation with the EU, we 
believe they cannot make a contrary finding, and so this spurious and time wasting inquiry into a 61/2 
year old minority stake between two Irish airlines, one of whom (Aer Lingus) has a tiny presence in the UK 
market should now be abandoned in the light of the EU Commission's finding that competition between 
Ryanair and Aer Lingus has intensified.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
 Fuel Hedging
 In recent years high oil prices and competitor fuel surcharges have made Ryanair's fares even more 
attractive to hard pressed European consumers.  The combination of high oil prices, increasing competitor 
losses, together with a shortage of financing for weaker credits, will lead to continued EU consolidation 
and closures.  Ryanair is 90% hedged for FY'14 at $980 per tonne (approx. $98 p.bl) and we have now 
extended our hedges into FY'15 with 25% of H1 hedged at $930 per tonne (approx. $93 p.bl).  We hope to 
continue to make meaningful reductions in our oil costs into FY'15.
 Balance Sheet
 Ryanair's balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry.  Our aircraft which have been 
purchased at substantially discounted prices, represents a significant long term benefit for our 
shareholders.  We have gross cash over EUR3.5bn and year-end net cash of EUR61m, despite having returned 
almost EUR500m to shareholders in November (EUR1.5bn over the past 5 years) via a second special dividend.  
We have also taken advantage of current low interest rates to secure almost 70% of our fleet financing all 
in at under 3% and we have completed our Capex hedging programme to the end of 2014 at Euro/Dollar 
exchange rate of 1.32.
 Outlook
 We expect traffic in FY.14 to grow by 3% to 81.5m.  Growth will be slower in H1 at approx. 2%, but rise 
to approx. 5% in H2 as we ground fewer winter aircraft (up to 60) compared to prior years.  Unit costs 
will increase primarily due to rising oil prices, a 3% growth in sector length, and unjustified higher 
Eurocontrol and Spanish airport charges.  Due to lower yields and higher fuel costs Q1 Net Profit will be 
lower than last year due to the timing of Easter (which boosted Q4 revenues) and its presence in the prior 
year Q1 comparable. With almost zero yield visibility into H2 and the EU wide recession, we expect that 
there will continue to be downward pressure on yields which will dampen full year profit growth.  We 
expect modest yield and traffic growth for the full year to be partly offset by higher oil and Eurocontrol 
costs resulting in another year of profit growth in FY'14 which - subject to winter yield outturns - 
should increase to a range of between EUR570m to EUR600m".

 Subject to certain exceptions for short-term and hedged positions, the U.S. dollar amount of dividends received by 
an individual on or post January 1, 2013 with respect to the Ordinary Shares or ADRs will be subject to taxation at a 
maximum rate of 20% if the dividends are "qualified dividends" (apart from the Medicare contribution tax referred to 
below), and the individual has taxable income that exceeds certain thresholds. Dividends paid on the Ordinary 
Shares or ADRs will be treated as qualified dividends if (i) the issuer is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive 
income tax treaty with the United States that the Internal Revenue Service has approved for the purposes of the 
qualified dividend rules and (ii) the Company was not, in the year prior to the year in which the dividend was paid, 
and is not, in the year in which the dividend is paid, a passive foreign investment company (a "PFIC"). The income 
tax treaty between Ireland and the United States has been approved for the purposes of the qualified dividend 
rules. Effective January 1, 2013, a Medicare contribution tax of 3.8% may also be applicable to U.S. individuals, 
estates and trusts. Based on the Company's audited financial statements and relevant market data, the Company 
believes that it was not treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to its 2013/14 taxable 
year. 
In addition, based on the Company's audited financial statements and its current expectations regarding the value 
and nature of its assets, the sources and nature of its income, and relevant market data, the Company does not 
anticipate becoming a PFIC for its 2014/15 taxable year.Under the U.S.-Ireland Income Tax Treaty currently in 
effect, in the event the Company were to pay any dividend, the tax credit attaching to the dividend (as used herein 
the "Tax Credit"; see "-Irish Tax Considerations") generally will be treated as a foreign income tax eligible for credit 
against such U.S. Holder's United States federal income tax liability, subject to generally applicable limitations and 
conditions. Any such dividend paid by the Company to such U.S. Holder will constitute income from sources outside 
the United States for foreign tax credit purposes, and generally will constitute "passive category" income for such 
purposes.
 Foreign tax credits may not be allowed for withholding taxes imposed in respect of certain short-term or hedged 
positions in securities.
 U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the implications of these rules in light of their 
particular circumstances.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -58-
 Distributions of Ordinary Shares that are made as part of a pro rata distribution to all stockholders generally will not 
be subject to U.S. federal income tax.
 Taxation of Capital Gains
 Sale or Disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADRs. Gains or losses realized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or other 
disposition of ADRs generally will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as capital gains or losses, which 
generally will be long-term capital gains or losses if the ADRs have been held for more than one year. The net 
amount of long-term capital gain recognized by an individual holder post January 1, 2013 generally is subject to 
taxation at a maximum rate of 20%. Effective January 1, 2013, a Medicare contribution tax of 3.8% may also be 
applicable to U.S. individuals, estates and trusts. Gains realized by a U.S. Holder generally will constitute income 
from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit purposes and generally will constitute "passive category" 
income for such purposes. The deductibility of capital losses, in excess of capital gains, is subject to limitations.
 Deposits and withdrawals of Ordinary Shares by U.S. Holders in exchange for ADRs will not result in the realization 
of gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 Non-U.S. Holders. A holder of Ordinary Shares or ADRs that is, with respect to the United States, a foreign 
corporation or a nonresident alien individual (a "Non-U.S. Holder") generally will not be subject to U.S. federal 
income or withholding tax on dividends received on such Ordinary Shares or ADRs unless such income is 
effectively connected with the conduct by such holder of a trade or business in the United States. A Non-U.S. 
Holder of ADRs or Ordinary Shares will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax in respect of 
gain realized on the sale or other disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADRs, unless (i) such gain is effectively 
connected with the conduct by such holder of a trade or business in the United States or (ii) in the case of gain 
realized by an individual Non-U.S. Holder, such Non-U.S. Holder is present in the United States for 183 days or 
more in the taxable year of the sale and certain other conditions are met.

 Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
 GENERAL
 Ryanair is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and currency 
exchange rates. The objective of financial risk management at Ryanair is to minimize the negative impact of 
commodity price, interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the Company's earnings, cash flows and 
equity.
 To manage these risks, Ryanair uses various derivative financial instruments, including cross currency interest rate 
swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and commodity forwards. These derivative financial instruments are 
generally held to maturity and are not actively traded. The Company enters into these arrangements with the goal of 
hedging its operational and balance sheet risk. However, Ryanair's exposure to commodity price, interest rate and 
currency exchange rate fluctuations cannot be neutralized completely.
 In executing its risk management strategy, Ryanair currently enters into forward contracts for the purchase of some 
of the jet fuel (jet kerosene) that it expects to use. It also uses foreign currency forward contracts intended to reduce 
its exposure to risks related to foreign currencies, principally the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, it enters into interest rate 
contracts with the objective of fixing certain borrowing costs and hedging principal repayments, particularly those 
associated with the purchase of new Boeing 737-800s. Ryanair is also exposed to the risk that the counterparties to 
its derivative financial instruments may not be creditworthy. Were a counterparty to default on its obligations under 
any of the instruments described below, Ryanair's economic expectations when entering into these arrangements 
might not be achieved and its financial condition could be adversely affected. Transactions involving derivative 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -58-
financial instruments are also relatively illiquid as compared with those involving other kinds of financial instruments. 
It is Ryanair's policy not to enter into transactions involving financial derivatives for speculative purposes.
 The following paragraphs describe Ryanair's fuel hedging, foreign currency and interest rate swap arrangements 
and analyze the sensitivity of the market value, earnings and cash flows of the financial instruments to hypothetical 
changes in commodity prices, interest rates and exchange rates as if these changes had occurred at March 31, 
2014. The range of changes selected for this sensitivity analysis reflects Ryanair's view of the changes that are 
reasonably possible over a one-year period.
 FUEL PRICE EXPOSURE AND HEDGING
 Fuel costs constitute a substantial portion of Ryanair's operating expenses (approximately 46.0% and 45.3% of 
such expenses in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively, after taking into account Ryanair's fuel hedging 
activities). Ryanair engages in fuel price hedging transactions from time to time, pursuant to which Ryanair and a 
counterparty agree to exchange payments equal to the difference between a fixed price for a given quantity of jet 
fuel and the market price for such quantity of jet fuel at a given date in the future, with Ryanair receiving the amount 
of any excess of such market price over such fixed price and paying to the counterparty the amount of any deficit of 
such fixed price under such market price.
 Ryanair has historically entered into arrangements providing for substantial protection against fluctuations in fuel 
prices, generally through forward contracts covering periods of up to 18 months of anticipated jet fuel requirements. 
See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel 
Availability Affect the Company's Results and Increases the Likelihood that the Company May Incur Losses" for 
additional information on recent trends in fuel costs and the Company's related hedging activities, as well as certain 
associated risks. See also "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Fiscal Year 2014 Compared 
with Fiscal Year 2013-Fuel and Oil." As of July 25, 2014, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet kerosene) 
contracts covering approximately 90% of its estimated requirements for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015 at 
prices equivalent to approximately $950 per metric ton. In addition, as of July 25, 2014, Ryanair had entered into 
forward jet fuel (jet kerosene) contracts covering approximately 55% of its estimated requirements for the first half 
of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016 at prices equivalent to approximately $950 per metric ton, and had not 
entered into any jet fuel

 Any Significant Outbreak of any Airborne Disease, Including Swine Flu or Foot-and-Mouth Disease, Could 
Significantly Damage Ryanair's Business. Worldwide, there has, from time to time, been substantial publicity in 
recent years regarding certain potent influenza viruses and other disease epidemics. Publicity of this type may have 
a negative impact on demand for air travel in Europe. Past outbreaks of SARS, foot-and-mouth disease, avian flu 
and swine flu have adversely impacted the travel industries, including aviation, in certain regions of the world, 
including Europe. The Company believes that if any influenza or other pandemic becomes severe in Europe, its 
effect on demand for air travel in the markets in which Ryanair operates could be material, and it could therefore 
have a significantly adverse impact on the Company. A severe outbreak of swine flu, SARS, foot-and-mouth 
disease, avian flu or another pandemic or livestock-related disease also may result in European or national 
authorities imposing restrictions on travel, further damaging Ryanair's business. A serious pandemic could therefore 
severely disrupt Ryanair's business, resulting in the cancellation or loss of bookings, and adversely affecting 
Ryanair's financial condition and results of operations.
 Introduction of New or Increases in Existing Aviation Taxes Could Increase Costs. A number of European states, 
including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany and Austria, currently impose taxes on air travel, often disguised 
as environmental taxes. Although the Netherlands reduced its aviation tax to zero in 2009 and Ireland reduced its 
tax from EUR10 to EUR3 in March 2011, due to government budgetary deficits these taxes may be reinstated in 
their previous or a new form. Further, other state governments or the European Union may introduce aviation 
taxation. Any such taxes would increase costs and could have a negative impact on demand for air travel. See also 
"-Environmental Regulation-Aviation Taxes" below.
 The Company is Dependent on the Continued Acceptance of Low-fares Airlines. In past years, accidents or other 
safety-related incidents involving certain low-fares airlines have had a negative impact on the public's acceptance of 
such airlines. Any adverse event potentially relating to the safety or reliability of low-fares airlines (including 
accidents or negative reports from regulatory authorities) could adversely impact the public's perception of, and 
confidence in, low-fares airlines like Ryanair, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial 
condition and results of operations.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -21-
 Terrorism in the United Kingdom or Elsewhere in Europe Could Have a Material Detrimental Effect on the 
Company. On August 10, 2006, U.K. security authorities arrested and subsequently charged eight individuals in 
connection with an alleged plot to attack aircraft operating on transatlantic routes. As a result of these arrests, U.K. 
authorities introduced increased security measures, which resulted in all passengers being body-searched, and a 
ban on the transportation in carry-on baggage of certain liquids and gels. The introduction of these measures led to 
passengers suffering severe delays while passing through these airport security checks. As a result, Ryanair 
cancelled 279 flights in the days following the incident and refunded a total of EUR2.7 million in fares to 
approximately 40,000 passengers. In the days following the arrests, Ryanair also suffered reductions in bookings 
estimated to have resulted in the loss of approximately EUR1.9 million of additional revenue. As in the past, the 
Company reacted to these adverse events by initiating system-wide fare sales to stimulate demand for air travel.
 In addition, reservations on Ryanair's flights to London dropped materially for a number of days in the immediate 
aftermath of the terrorist attacks in London on July 7, 2005. Although the terrorist attack in Glasgow on June 30, 
2007 and the failed terrorist attacks in London on July 21, 2005 and June 29, 2007 had no material impact on 
bookings, there can be no assurance that future such attacks will not affect passenger traffic. In the 2012 fiscal 
year, 16.0 million passengers were booked on Ryanair's flights into and out of London, representing 21.0% of the 
total passengers booked on all of the Company's flights in the fiscal year. Future acts of terrorism or significant 
terrorist threats, particularly in London or other markets that are significant to Ryanair, could have a material 
adverse effect on the Company's profitability or financial condition should the public's willingness to travel to and 
from those markets decline as a result. See also "-The 2001 Terrorist Attacks on the United States Had a Severe 
Negative Impact on the International Airline Industry" below.
 The 2001 Terrorist Attacks on the United States Had a Severe Negative Impact on the International Airline 
Industry. The terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, in which four commercial aircraft were 
hijacked, had a severe negative impact on the international airline industry, particularly on U.S. carriers and carriers 
operating international services to and from the United States. Although carriers such as Ryanair that operate 
primarily or exclusively in Europe were generally spared from such material adverse impacts on their businesses, 
the cost to all commercial airlines of insurance coverage for certain third-party liabilities arising from "acts of war" or 
terrorism increased dramatically after the September 11 attacks. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-
Insurance." In addition, Ryanair's insurers have indicated that the scope of the Company's current "act of war"-
related insurance may exclude certain types of catastrophic incidents, such as certain forms of biological, chemical 
or "dirty bomb" attacks. This could result in the Company's seeking alternative coverage, including government 
insurance or self-insurance, which could lead to further increases in costs. Although Ryanair to date has passed on 
increased insurance costs to passengers by means of a special "insurance levy" on each ticket, there can be no 
assurance that it will continue to be successful in doing so.
 Because a substantial portion of airline travel (both business and personal) is discretionary and because Ryanair is 
substantially dependent on discretionary air travel, any prolonged general reduction in airline passenger traffic may 
adversely affect the Company. Similarly, any significant increase in expenses related to security, insurance or 
related costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Any further terrorist attacks in the U.S. or in 
Europe, particularly in London or other markets that are significant to Ryanair, any significant military actions by the 
United States or EU nations or any related economic downturn may have a material adverse effect on demand for 
air travel and thus on Ryanair's business, operating results, and financial condition. See also "-Risks Related to the 
Company-Further Terrorist Attacks in London and Other Destinations Could Have a Detrimental Effect on the 
Company."
 The Company Faces the Risk of Loss and Liability. Ryanair is exposed to potential catastrophic losses that may be 
incurred in the event of an aircraft accident or terrorist incident. Any such accident or incident could involve costs 
related to the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequent temporary or permanent loss from 
service. In addition, an accident or incident could result in significant legal claims against the Company from injured 
passengers and others who experienced injury or property damage as a result of the accident or incident, including 
ground victims. Ryanair currently maintains passenger liability insurance, employer liability insurance, aircraft 
insurance for aircraft loss or damage, and other business insurance in amounts per occurrence that are consistent 
with industry standards.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -21-
 Ryanair currently believes its insurance coverage is adequate (although not comprehensive). However, there can 
be no assurance that the amount of insurance coverage will not need to be increased, that insurance premiums will 
not increase significantly, or that Ryanair will not be forced to bear substantial losses from any accidents not 
covered by its insurance. Airline insurance costs increased dramatically following the September 2001 terrorist 
attacks on the United States. See "-The 2001 Terrorist Attacks on the United States Had a Severe Negative Impact 
on the International Airline Industry" above. Substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of related 
insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial 
condition. Moreover, any aircraft accident, even if fully insured, could lead to the public perception that Ryanair's 
aircraft were less safe or reliable than those operated by other airlines, which could have a material adverse effect 
on Ryanair's business.
 EU Regulation No. 2027/97, as amended by Regulation No. 889/2002, governs air carrier liability. See "Item 4. 
Information on the Company-Insurance" for details of this regulation. This regulation increased the potential liability 
exposure of air carriers such as Ryanair. Although Ryanair has extended its liability insurance to meet the 
requirements of the regulation, no assurance can be given that other laws, regulations, or policies will not be 
applied, modified or amended in a manner that has a material adverse effect on Ryanair's business, operating 
results, and financial condition.

RYANAIR'S JULY TRAFFIC GROWS 19%
LOWEST FARES AIRTRAVEL GROWING RAPIDLY
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fare airlines today (Tuesday, 5th August 2008)
announced that it carried almost 5.2 million passengers in July, a 19% (900,000
passenger) increase when compared to July 2007.
Ryanair is confident that traffic growth will remain strong as Ryanair continues
to offer passengers the guaranteed lowest airfares and no fuel surcharges this
winter. These strong growth figures prove that low fares travel is growing
rapidly as competitors raise their high fares and fuel surcharges.
Stephen McNamara, Head of Communications, said:
"Ryanair's latest passenger figures show that we are rapidly growing
passenger numbers this year. The most significant thing about today's figures is
that we carried over 15million passengers in the last three months. Passengers
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 's July Traffic Grows 19%
are increasingly attracted to Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares and our promise
of no fuel surcharges ever".
The following are Ryanair's passenger and load factor statistics for July 2008:

 levels. In May 2010 the BAA announced that it would not proceed with this GBP4 billion program.
 Ryanair announced on July 21, 2009 that, as a result of the U.K. government's then GBP10 APD tourist tax (as 
well as the then scheduled increase in APD from GBP10 to GBP11, which occurred in November 2009, from 
GBP11 to GBP12 which occurred in November 2010 and from GBP12 to GBP13 in April 2012) and the high costs 
of operating at its London (Stansted) base, it would implement a 40% reduction in capacity at such base between 
October 2009 and March 2010. In particular, the Company announced its intention to reduce its London (Stansted)-
based aircraft from the then current 40 to 24 during the aforementioned period, and also reduce by 30% the number 
of weekly Ryanair flights to and from the airport. The Company announced at that time that it expected these cuts to 
result in 2.5 million fewer passenger trips during the period. In addition, on June 29, 2010, due to the continuance of 
the U.K. government's GBP11 APD tourist tax and high charges at London (Stansted) airport, the Company 
announced that capacity at London (Stansted) airport would be reduced from winter 2010 by 17% and the number 
of aircraft based at London (Stansted) would be reduced to 22. Ryanair also noted that, as a result of other capacity 
reductions at its U.K. bases except for the bases at Edinburgh and Leeds Bradford, its total U.K. capacity fell by 
16% in the period from November 1, 2010 to March 31, 2011. See "Item 3. Risk Factors[3/4]Risks Related to the 
Company[3/4]Ryanair's Continued Growth is Dependent on Access to Suitable Airports; Charges for Airport Access 
are Subject to Increase." See also "Item 8. Financial Information[3/4]Other Financial Information[3/4]Legal 
Proceedings[3/4]EU State Aid-Related Proceedings" for information regarding legal proceedings in which Ryanair's 
economic arrangements with several publicly owned airports are being contested.
 FUEL
 The cost of jet fuel accounted for approximately 43% and 39% of Ryanair's total operating expenses in the fiscal 
years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively (in each case, this accounts for costs after giving effect to the 
Company's fuel hedging activities but excludes de-icing costs, which accounted for approximately 1% of total fuel 
costs in each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011). Jet fuel costs experienced substantial variance 
in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011.  The future availability and cost of jet fuel cannot be predicted 
with any degree of certainty, and Ryanair's low-fares policy limits its ability to pass on increased fuel costs to 
passengers through increased fares. Jet fuel prices are dependent on crude oil prices, which are quoted in U.S. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -29-
dollars. If the value of the U.S. dollar rises against the euro, Ryanair's fuel costs, expressed in euro, may increase 
even absent any increase in the U.S. dollar price of jet fuel. Ryanair has also entered into foreign currency forward 
contracts to hedge against some currency fluctuations. See "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures 
About Market Risk-Foreign Currency Exposure and Hedging."
 Ryanair has historically entered into arrangements providing for substantial protection against fluctuations in fuel 
prices, generally through forward contracts covering periods of up to 18 months of anticipated jet fuel requirements. 
Ryanair (like many other airlines) has, in more recent periods, entered into hedging arrangements on a much more 
selective basis. As of July 27, 2012, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet kerosene) contracts covering 
approximately 90% of its estimated requirements for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013 at prices equivalent to 
approximately $1,000 per metric ton. In addition, as of July 27, 2012, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet 
kerosene) contracts covering approximately 50% of its estimated requirements for the first half of the fiscal year 
ending March 31, 2014 at prices equivalent to approximately $935 per metric ton, and had not entered into any jet 
fuel hedging contracts with respect to its expected fuel purchases beyond that period. See "Item 3. Key Information-
Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel Availability Affect the Company's 
Results and Increase the Likelihood of Adverse Impact to the Company's Profitability" and "Item 11. Quantitative 
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Fuel Price Exposure and Hedging" for additional information on 
recent trends in fuel costs and the Company's related hedging activities, as well as certain associated risks. See 
also "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Fiscal Year 2012 Compared with Fiscal Year 2011-
Fuel and Oil."
 The following table details Ryanair's fuel consumption and costs for scheduled operations (i.e. it excludes costs 
related to de-icing and EU emissions trading costs) after giving effect to the Company's fuel hedging activities for 
fiscal years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. The excluded de-icing costs amounted to EUR9.3 million, 
EUR11.2 million and EUR11.6 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. De-
icing costs are costs incurred for the labor and anti-freeze used to de-ice aircraft. The excluded EU emissions 
trading costs amounted to EUR2.2 million, nil and nil, respectively for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 
and 2010.

 INSURANCE
 Ryanair is exposed to potential catastrophic losses that may be incurred in the event of an aircraft 
accident or terrorist incident. Any such accident or incident could involve costs related to the repair or 
replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequent temporary or permanent loss from service. In 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -29-
addition, an accident or incident could result in significant legal claims against the Company from 
injured passengers and others who experienced injury or property damage as a result of the accident or 
incident, including ground victims. Ryanair maintains aviation third-party liability insurance, passenger 
liability insurance, employer liability insurance, directors and officers liability insurance, aircraft 
insurance for aircraft loss or damage, and other business insurance in amounts per occurrence consistent 
with industry standards. Ryanair believes its insurance coverage is adequate, although not comprehensive. 
There can be no assurance that the amount of such coverage will not need to be increased, that insurance 
premiums will not increase significantly or that Ryanair will not be forced to bear substantial losses 
from accidents. Ryanair's insurance does not cover claims for losses incurred when, due to unforeseen 
events, airspace is closed and aircraft are grounded, such as the airspace closures described on page 51, 
which resulted from volcanic ash in the northern European airspace during April and May 2010.
 The cost of insurance coverage for certain third-party liabilities arising from "acts of war" or 
terrorism increased dramatically as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. In the immediate 
aftermath, aircraft liability war indemnities for amounts above $50 million were, in the absence of any 
alternative coverage, provided by the Irish Government at pre-September 11, 2001 levels of coverage on the 
basis of a per-passenger surcharge. In March 2002, once such coverage was again commercially available, 
Ryanair arranged coverage to replace that provided by the government indemnity. The replacement insurance 
coverage operated on the basis of a per-passenger surcharge with an additional surcharge based on hull 
values. Ryanair's insurers have indicated that the scope of the Company's current war-related insurance 
coverage may exclude certain types of catastrophic incidents, which may result in the Company seeking 
alternative coverage. Ryanair to date has passed increased insurance costs on to passengers by means of a 
special "insurance levy" on each ticket.

RYANAIR REPORTS Q3 PROFIT OF EUR103M, UP EUR54M
 LOWER FARES (-1%) DRIVES Q3 TRAFFIC GROWTH OF 20%
 EUR800M SHARE BUY-BACK PROGRAMME ANNOUNCED
 ---------------------------------------------------
Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (Feb 1) announced Q3 profits of EUR103m, a 110% increase on prior 
year.  Traffic grew 20% to 25m as ave. fares fell 1% to EUR40 (load factors rose 5% points to 93%) while unit costs 
fell by 5% (ex-fuel down 1%).

Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
 "We are pleased to report that our low fares policy delivered strong Q3 traffic and profit growth. It is 
clear that millions of new customers are switching to Ryanair for our "load factor active/yield passive" 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
pricing, our expanding route network and the success of our Always Getting Better ("AGB") customer 
experience programme. Following a strong first half of Q3, we noted weaker pricing and bookings 
immediately after the terrorist events in Paris and Brussels.  We reacted to this softness by running 
price promotions and discounted fares to stimulate double digit traffic growth. While average fares fell 
1% (previously guided flat pricing), this was offset by lower unit costs.
 Key Q3 milestones include:
 --   Ave. fares down 1% to EUR40
 --   Traffic up 20% to 24.9m (LF up 5 points to 93%)
 --   Unit costs fell 5% (ex-fuel down 1%)
 --   Q3 profits up 110% to EUR103m
 --   Aer Lingus proceeds (EUR398m) distributed to shareholders in Nov
 --   New website and mobile app launched in Oct
 --   5 year pay & conditions deals agreed with all 76 pilot & cabin crew bases
 --   First airline to carry over 100m international customers in calendar year (101.4m)
 New Routes and Bases:
 The 4 new bases opened in Q3 (Berlin, Corfu, Gothenburg and Milan Malpensa) enjoyed strong advance 
bookings and are performing well.  This winter we will deliver double digit traffic growth in Ireland, UK, 
Spain, Italy, Portugal, Poland, Germany and Denmark as we add 119 new routes to the network.   2 new bases 
(Belfast and Ibiza) will open in March for summer 2016.  We are finalising our winter 2016 schedule and 
will announce more new routes and destinations during Feb.  This will include our first Romanian base 
(Timisoara) which opens in Nov 2016.
 Improving "AGB" customer experience:
 Our AGB programme and lower fares are driving strong forward bookings, higher load factors and 
accelerating traffic growth. We must again raise our full year traffic target to 106m (from 105m 
previously guided).  This represents a 17% increase on last year's 90.6m customers.  In Oct we launched 
our new website and mobile app both of which are performing well.  In Nov we ran a number of market 
leading promotions for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.  Since Jan our new aircraft are delivering with the 
Boeing Sky interiors and slimline seats which will provide our customers with more leg room and an 
improved on board experience.  From Feb 1 our cabin crew will be wearing our new (Irish designed) 
uniforms.  We will announce further initiatives over the coming months as we move into year 3 of our AGB 
programme.
 Ryanair continues to offer the lowest fares in every market along with the best on-time performance. In 
the first 9 months of FY16, despite the impact of French ATC strikes in Q1, the fire closure of T3 in Rome 
(FCO), record load factors, and disgraceful delays in Q3 as a direct result of the introduction of a new 
French ATC computer system, our on-time performance improved by an ave. of 2% points to 91% as follows:
Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Cum.
 ------  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  -----
 FY15    91%   89%   87%   86%   90%   90%   92%   91%   84%   89%

 ------  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  -----
Fuel and US$ Hedging:
 We have taken advantage of recent oil price weakness to extend our fuel hedges into FY18.  FY17 fuel is 
95% hedged at approx. $62bbl and EUR/$ is hedged at $1.17 which will deliver fuel savings of c. EUR430m in 
FY17.  We are just over 50% hedged for H1 FY18 at approx. $52bbl.  We have also hedged 65% of our FY18 
EUR/$ opex requirements at $1.11.    We plan to pass these further fuel savings to our customers in the 
form of lower airfares particularly as we grow capacity in major markets such as Belgium, Denmark, 
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain and the UK in 2016 and 2017.
 Lower Costs:
 Our relentless focus on costs saw unit costs fall by 5% in Q3.  Fuel, which represents 40% of our cost 
base, was down 10% per passenger.  Q3 ex-fuel unit costs fell by 1%, and are on track to fall by 2% for 
the full year, which is an impressive performance given our continued expansion into more expensive 
primary airports and the adverse impact of EUR/GBP exchange rate movements.  In the 2 years since we 
launched AGB, we have seen ex-fuel unit costs fall by over 2%.  In Jan we concluded new 5 year pay & 
conditions deals with all 76 pilot and cabin crew bases.  These long term agreements, along with our low-
cost aircraft deliveries, ongoing fuel savings, growth discount airport deals, low-cost bond financing and 
personalised marketing via our new website will ensure that Ryanair continues to lower its unit cost base 
while our competitors see their costs rise.
 Shareholder Returns & Balance Sheet:
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
 In light of our rising profitability and improving cashflow, the Board has approved an EUR800m share buy-
back to commence on Feb 5 next.  We expect this programme will, subject to market conditions, be executed 
over a 9 month period.  When this buy-back is complete, we will have returned in excess of EUR4bn to 
shareholders over the past 8 years (since 2008).
 Our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry.  We had net cash of EUR350m at Dec 2015 
notwithstanding capex of EUR726m, shareholder distributions of EUR687m and debt repayments of EUR281m 
during the current financial year.
 Outlook:
 We continue to see significant growth opportunities for Ryanair's unique "load factor active/yield 
passive" policy which is now supported by our AGB customer experience programme.  Stronger load factors 
have raised our FY16 traffic target from 105m to 106m customers.  We expect Q4 traffic will grow by 26% 
(22% previously guided).
 With limited visibility of close-in Easter bookings in March, we now expect Q4 fares to fall by -6% 
(previously -4%).  Yields in Q4 and FY17 will be impacted by weaker sterling and the short notice 
imposition of a EUR2.50 increase in Italy's municipal tax (to pay for Alitalia pilot pensions) from Jan 1 
which must be funded directly from our airfares. Full year unit costs should fall by 6% (ex-fuel down 2%).  
Ancillary revenue, while ahead of our long term 20% target, will track behind this year's 17% traffic 
increase due to a one-time benefit last year from the earlier loading of the summer FY15 schedule and the 
absence of car-hire revenues in July and Aug 2015.
 Accordingly, we remain comfortable with our full year guidance that net profits will be towards the upper 
end of the EUR1,175m to EUR1,225m range (pre-exceptions).  We caution, however, that this guidance is 
heavily dependent on the absence of further unforeseen events impacting close-in bookings and yields in 
Q4, especially over Easter, where we are working to deliver 26% traffic growth."

 Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel Availability Affect the Company's Results and Increase the Likelihood of Adverse 
Impact to the Company's Profitability. Jet fuel costs are subject to wide fluctuations as a result of many economic 
and political factors and events occurring throughout the world that Ryanair can neither control nor accurately 
predict, including increases in demand, sudden disruptions in supply and other concerns about global supply, as 
well as market speculation. For example, although they declined in the 2010 fiscal year, oil prices increased 
substantially in fiscal years 2009 and 2011. These increases had a significant impact on Ryanair's costs, and the 
fiscal year 2009 increase contributed to the decline in profit before exceptional items recorded in the 2009 fiscal 
year. As international prices for jet fuel are denominated in U.S. dollars, Ryanair's fuel costs are also subject to 
certain exchange rate risks. Substantial price increases, adverse exchange rates, or the unavailability of adequate 
supplies, including, without limitation, any such events resulting from international terrorism, prolonged hostilities in 
the Middle East or other oil-producing regions or the suspension of production by any significant producer, may 
adversely affect Ryanair's profitability. In the event of a fuel shortage resulting from a disruption of oil imports or 
otherwise, additional increases in fuel prices or a curtailment of scheduled services could result.
 Ryanair has historically entered into arrangements providing for substantial protection against fluctuations in fuel 
prices, generally through forward contracts covering periods of up to 18 months of anticipated jet fuel requirements. 
Ryanair (like many other airlines) has, in more recent periods, entered into hedging arrangements on a more 
selective basis. As of July 22, 2011, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet kerosene) contracts covering 
approximately 90% of its estimated requirements for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012 at prices equivalent to 
approximately $820 per metric ton. In addition, as of July 22, 2011, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet 
kerosene) contracts covering approximately 20% of its estimated requirements for the first quarter of the fiscal year 
ending March 31, 2013 at prices equivalent to approximately $1,035 per metric ton, and had not entered into any jet 
fuel hedging contracts with respect to its expected fuel purchases beyond that quarter. Because of the limited 
nature of its hedging program, the Company is exposed to risks arising from fluctuations in the price of fuel, 
especially in light of the recent volatility. Any new increase in fuel costs could have a material adverse effect on the 
Company's financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the 
euro could have an adverse effect on the cost of buying fuel in euro. As of July 22, 2011, Ryanair had hedged 75% 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -15-
of its forecasted fuel-related dollar purchases against the euro at a rate of $1.38 per euro for the period to 
December 31, 2012, without, however, having entered into any material hedging arrangements with respect to 
periods thereafter. See "-The Company May Not Be Successful in Raising Fares to Offset Increased Business 
Costs" below.
 No assurances whatsoever can be given about trends in fuel prices, and average fuel prices for the 2012 fiscal 
year or for future years may be significantly higher than current prices. Management estimates that every $10.00 
movement in the price of a metric ton of jet fuel will impact Ryanair's costs by approximately EUR1.5 million, taking 
into account Ryanair's hedging program for the 2012 fiscal year. There can be no assurance, however, in this 
regard, and the impact of fuel prices on Ryanair's operating results may be more pronounced. There also cannot be 
any assurance that Ryanair's current or any future arrangements will be adequate to protect Ryanair from increases 
in the price of fuel or that Ryanair will not incur losses due to high fuel prices alone or in combination with other 
factors. See "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Fuel Price Exposure and 
Hedging." Because of Ryanair's low fares and its no-fuel-surcharges policy, as well as the Company's expansion 
plans, which could have a negative impact on yields, its ability to pass on increased fuel costs to passengers 
through increased fares or otherwise is somewhat limited. Moreover, the anticipated expansion of Ryanair's fleet 
will result in an increase, in absolute terms, in Ryanair's aggregate fuel costs.
 Based upon Ryanair's fuel consumption for the 2011 fiscal year, a change of $1.00 in the average annual price per 
metric ton of jet fuel would have caused a change of approximately EUR1.5 million in the Company's annual fuel 
costs. Ryanair's fuel costs in the 2011 fiscal year, after giving effect to the Company's fuel hedging activities, 
increased by approximately 37% from the comparable period ended March 31, 2010, to EUR1,227.0 million, 
primarily due to higher market prices per metric ton and growth of the airline. Ryanair estimates that its fuel costs 
would have been approximately EUR1,275.1 million in the 2011 fiscal year, as compared to EUR916.6 million in the 
2010 fiscal year, had Ryanair not had any fuel hedging arrangements in place in either fiscal year.
 Ryanair Has Decided to Seasonally Ground Aircraft. In recent years, in response to an operating environment 
characterized by high fuel prices, typically lower winter yields and higher airport charges and/or taxes, Ryanair has 
adopted a policy of grounding a certain portion of its fleet during the winter months (from November to March). In 
the winter of 2010-11, Ryanair grounded approximately 40 aircraft and the Company announced in May 2011 that it 
intends to ground up to 80 aircraft during the coming winter. As a result, while the Company still expects to grow 
passenger traffic during fiscal 2012 as a whole, it expects that its passenger volumes during the winter months of 
2011-12 will be lower than those recorded during the winter months of 2010-11, which could have a negative impact 
on its results of operations and/or financial condition.
 Ryanair's adoption of the policy of seasonally grounding aircraft presents some risks. While the Company seeks to 
implement its seasonal grounding policy in a way that will allow it to avoid suffering losses by operating flights to 
high cost airports at low winter yields, there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful. Additionally, 
the Company's growth has been largely dependent on increasing capacity, and decreasing capacity may affect the 
overall future growth of the Company. Further, while seasonal grounding does reduce the Company's variable 
operating costs, it does not avoid aircraft ownership costs, and it also decreases Ryanair's potential to earn 
ancillary revenues. Decreasing the number and frequency of flights may also negatively affect the Company's labor 
relations, including its ability to attract flight personnel interested in full-time employment. Such risks could lead to 
negative effects on the Company's financial condition and/or results of operations.
 The Company May Not Be Successful in Reducing Business Costs to Offset Reduced Fares. Ryanair operates a 
low-fares airline. The success of its business model depends on its ability to control costs so as to deliver low fares 
while at the same time earning a profit. The Company has limited control over its fuel costs and already has 
comparatively low other operating costs. In periods of high fuel costs, if the Company is unable to further reduce its 
other operating costs or generate additional revenues, operating profits are likely to fall. The Company cannot offer 
any assurances regarding its future profitability. See "-The Company Faces Significant Price and Other Pressures 
in a Highly Competitive Environment" below and "-Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel Availability Affect the 
Company's Results and Increase the Likelihood that the Company May Incur Additional Losses" above.
 The Company is Subject to Legal Proceedings Alleging State Aid at Certain Airports. Formal investigations are 
ongoing by the European Commission into Ryanair's agreements with the Lubeck, Schonefeld, Tampere, Alghero, 
Pau, Aarhus and Frankfurt (Hahn) airports. The investigations seek to determine whether the arrangements 
constitute illegal state aid. In addition to the European Commission investigations, Ryanair is facing allegations that 
it has benefited from unlawful state aid in a number of court cases, including in relation to its arrangements with 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -15-
Frankfurt (Hahn) and Lubeck airports. Adverse rulings in these matters could be used as precedents by competitors 
to challenge Ryanair's agreements with other publicly owned airports and could cause Ryanair to strongly 
reconsider its growth strategy in relation to public or state-owned airports across Europe. This could in turn lead to a 
scaling-back of Ryanair's overall growth strategy due to the smaller number of privately owned airports available for 
development.
 No assurance can be given as to the outcome of legal proceedings, nor as to whether any unfavorable outcomes 
may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the results of operation or financial condition 
of the Company. For additional information, please see "Item 8. Financial Information[3/4]Other Financial 
Information[3/4]Legal Proceedings."

 CSO confirms continuing slump in visitor figures since Irish Government's EUR10
 tourist tax introduced
 Ryanair calls on Government to scrap EUR10 tourist tax now
Ryanair, the World's favourite airline, today (6th Aug 09) welcomed the CSO June
 traffic figures which confirm that 114,000 (15%) fewer visitors travelled to
 Ireland in June as the Government's EUR10 tourist tax continues to devastate Irish
 tourism. Ryanair's traffic in June grew by 13%, more than 670,000 new
 passengers, which disproves the Governments false claim that that this decline
 is due to the recession.
Ryanair warned that unless the Irish Government's EUR10 tourist tax is scrapped,
 then the fall in Irish visitor numbers will worsen next winter, as more flights,
 routes and services are cut from Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports.
Ryanair's Daniel de Carvalho said:
"CSO figures show a 15% drop in visitor numbers in June. The loss of these
 114,000 visitors confirms that the collapse in Irish tourism is accelerating as
 the Irish Government's EUR10 tourist tax makes Ireland an uncompetitive tourist
 market.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Calls on Irish Govt. to Scrap Tourist Tax
"In recent months the Belgian, Dutch, Greek and Spanish governments have all
 scrapped tourist taxes and/or reduced airport charges to zero in order to
 stimulate tourism. Ryanair has expanded in these countries including our recent
 announcement of 43 new routes to/from Spain this winter.The Irish Government
 cannot grow Irish tourism by taxing it. We must scrap this stupid EUR10 tourist
 tax and start welcoming visitors, not taxing them".

 RYANAIR TO CLOSE BELFAST CITY BASE (1 AIRCRAFT) PROMISED RUNWAY EXTENSION
 DEFERRED... AGAIN
Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (31st Aug) announced that it would
 close its Belfast City Airport base at the end of the current summer schedule on
 Sun 31 October 2010, following the airport's confirmation that the public
 inquiry into the promised runway extension will be further delayed, thereby
 delaying yet again the launch of Ryanair low fare flights from Belfast City
 Airport to destinations all over Europe.
Ryanair regrets that despite repeated promises, the runway extension at Belfast
 City, which was originally scheduled to be delivered in 2008, still has not been
 approved by the Northern Ireland Government, and would now be the subject of a
 delayed public inquiry, which means the runway extension will not be delivered
 until 2012 at the earliest, some 4 years after it was originally promised.
Ryanair, which launched a base in Belfast City in Oct 2007, operates five routes
 to the UK because of the short runway at Belfast City.  Ryanair had planned to
 open up a wide range of low fare European routes from/to Belfast City once the
 promised runway extension was delivered, but this has sadly failed to
 materialise.  Today's closure of Ryanair's Belfast City base means that Belfast
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair to close Belfast City base
 and Northern Ireland tourism will lose up to 1 million passengers annually.
From early in November, Ryanair will switch its one Belfast City based aircraft
 to another European airport, with the loss of 50 Ryanair jobs (all staff will be
 offered relocation elsewhere in the UK or Europe) and the loss of 1 million
 passengers annually, which will result in the loss of up to 1,000 support jobs
 in and around Belfast City Airport.  Sadly passengers to/from all Belfast
 airports will now pay much higher fares to travel to/from the UK with other
 airlines.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"It is very disappointing that the promised runway extension at Belfast City
 Airport has still not materialised more than 3 years after we opened the base at
 Belfast City.  It makes no sense for Ryanair to continue to invest in Belfast
 City, operating restricted routes with less than full payloads between Belfast
 and other UK airports (which suffer a double APD penalty) unless there is clear
 and immediate prospect of Ryanair being enabled to safely operate longer
 European routes from Belfast City Airport and for this we need the runway
 extension.
While we recognise the right of the Government and people of Northern Ireland to
 subject this small runway extension to an extended planning process, these
 repeated delays, the reference to a public inquiry and now the further delay to
 the public inquiry for spurious noise reasons, shows a lack of willingness on
 the part of the local authorities to grow and develop traffic, routes, tourism
 and jobs in Northern Ireland.
In these circumstances sadly we have better alternative airports elsewhere in
 the UK and Europe, all of whom are willing and able to provide us with the
 runway infrastructure and low cost facilities we need in order to operate our
 lowest fare flights immediately, safely and profitably.
We will of course continue to work with Brian Ambrose and his team at Belfast
 City Airport, and wish them continued success in securing the runway extension,
 but we are not prepared to continue to operate at Belfast City with restricted
 routes and loads because of repeated planning delays.  I would like to
 personally thank Brian Ambrose and his team for their help and support in
 developing a successful route network there in recent years, which has seen
 Ryanair deliver more than 3m passengers over the past 3 years at Belfast City,
 whilst sustaining up to 50 direct and over 1,000 indirect jobs at the airport
 and local support services."

Commitments resulting from the use of derivative financial instruments by the Company are described in 
Notes 5 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
 Contingencies
 The Company is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business. Management does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Company. Should the Company be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or financial position.
 In February 2004, the European Commission ruled that Ryanair had received illegal state aid from the 
Walloon regional government in connection with its establishment of a low cost base at Brussels 
(Charleroi). Ryanair advised the regional government that it believed no money was repayable as the cost 
of establishing the base exceeded the amount determined to be illegal state aid. Ryanair also appealed the 
decision of the European Commission to the European Court of First Instance ("CFI"), requesting that the 
Court annul the decision on the basis that Ryanair's agreement at Brussels (Charleroi) was consistent with 
agreements at similar privately owned airports and therefore did not constitute illegal state aid. The 
Company placed EUR4 million in an escrow account pending the outcome of this appeal. In December 2008, the 
CFI annulled the Commission's decision against Charleroi Airport and Ryanair was repaid the EUR4 million 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -91-
that the Commission had claimed was illegal state aid. A further action taken by the Belgian government 
for EUR2.3 million has also been withdrawn.
 Ryanair is facing similar legal challenges with respect to agreements with certain other airports, 
notably Lubeck, Berlin (Schonefeld), Tampere, Alghero, Pau, Aarhus, Frankfurt (Hahn), Niederrhein (Weeze), 
Zweibrucken, Altenburg, Klagenfurt, Vasteras, Paris (Beauvais), La Rochelle, Carcassonne, Nimes, 
Angouleme, Marseille and Brussels (Charleroi). In January 2010, the European commission concluded the 
Bratislava state aid investigation with a finding that Ryanair's agreement with Bratislava airport 
involved no aid. The remaining nineteen investigations involving Ryanair are ongoing and Ryanair currently 
expects that they will conclude within the next 12 months, with any European Commission's decisions 
appealable to the EU General Court.
 State aid complaints by Lufthansa about Ryanair's cost base at Frankfurt (Hahn) have been rejected by 
German courts, as have similar complaints by Air Berlin in relation to Ryanair's arrangement with Lubeck 
airport, but following a German Supreme Court ruling on a procedural issue in early 2011, these cases will 
be re-heard by lower courts. In addition, Ryanair has been involved in legal challenges including 
allegations of state aid at Alghero and Marseille airports. The Alghero case (initiated by Air One) was 
dismissed in its entirety in April 2011. The Marseille case was withdrawn by the plaintiffs (subsidiaries 
of Air France) in May 2011.
 The Company has also entered into a series of interest rate swaps to hedge against fluctuations in 
interest rates for certain floating-rate financing arrangements. Cash deposits have been set aside as 
collateral for the counterparty's exposure to risk of fluctuations on long-term derivative and other 
financing arrangements with Ryanair (restricted cash) (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 
for further details). Additional numerical information on these swaps and on other derivatives held by the 
Company is set out in Notes 5 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements.

25           Dividends and Share buy-backs
 In August 2011, the Company bought back 27.0 million ordinary shares at a cost of EUR85.1 million.  In 
March 2012, the Company bought back a further 9.5 million ordinary shares at a cost of EUR39.5 million.  
Overall this is equivalent to approximately 2.5% of the Company's issued share capital.  All ordinary 
shares repurchased have been cancelled.  Accordingly, share capital decreased by 36.5 million ordinary 
shares with a nominal value of EUR0.2 million and the capital redemption reserve increased by a 
corresponding EUR0.2 million.  The capital redemption reserve is required to be created under Irish law to 
preserve permanent capital in the parent Company. See note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for 
further details.
 On October 1, 2010, following shareholder approval at the Company's annual general meeting on September 
22, 2010, Ryanair Holdings plc paid a special dividend of EUR500 million, (33.57 euro cent per ordinary 
share), to shareholders.  Prior to effecting the dividend payment and in order to ensure that the parent 
company, Ryanair Holdings plc, had sufficient distributable profits to effect the dividend payment, on 
June 15, 2010, Ryanair Limited declared a dividend of EUR400 million to Ryanair Holdings plc.
 The Company announced on May 21, 2012 that it plans to pay a special dividend of EUR0.34 per ordinary 
share (approx EUR489 million) in November 2012 subject to shareholder approval at the annual general 
meeting on September 21, 2012.
 26           Post-balance sheet events
 On March 29, 2012, the Company agreed to buy back 15.0 million ordinary shares at a cost of EUR67.5 
million. This is equivalent to 1.0% of the issued share capital of the Company at March 31, 2012.  This 
trade settled in early April 2012 and the repurchased shares were cancelled.
 On June 19, 2012 Ryanair announced its intention to make an all cash offer of EUR1.30 per share for the 
entire issued share capital of Aer Lingus Group plc.

 RYANAIR REJECTS DEPT OF TRANSPORT CLAIMS
 Ryanair, Ireland's largest airline, today (2(nd) Aug) rejected the inaccurate claims made by the Dept of Transport in 
relation to the EUR3 travel tax.
 Ryanair pointed out the following facts:
 1. The EUR10 travel tax was reduced to EUR3 because the EU ruled that the differential tax was illegal. The travel 
tax was reduced to EUR3 to comply with EU guidelines, not as a "jobs initiative".
 2. The Department's claim that it could not secure "solid commitments" from airlines on inbound routes or capacity 
is untrue. Ryanair submitted a "solid commitment" to deliver up to 5 million additional passengers p.a. over a five 
year period, which would create up to 5,000 new jobs at the main Irish airports.
 3. The Department's claim that "the new routes offered were predominately to Mediterranean hotspots" is untrue in 
Ryanair's case, since the majority of routes offered by Ryanair were to UK and Continental (non Mediterranean) 
European destinations.
 4. If, as the Department claims, increasing air traffic and tourism is part of the "jobs initiative" then it should explain 
why outbound passengers are somehow less valuable than inbound passengers. It is not possible to create low 
cost access with inbound passengers only, since any route - to be successful - needs a balance of outbound and 
inbound traffic to sustain it over a 12 month period.
 Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
 "The Dept of Transport's announcement of an EUR8.5m "marketing fund" is more of the same failed policy of the 
last Government, who wasted over EUR100m p.a. in tourism marketing monies each year, while air traffic declined 
by over 30%. No marketing spend can hide the fact that the main Irish airports are high cost, and traffic will continue 
to decline as a result of the DAA's 40% increase in airport charges and the Government's travel tax. The truth 
behind the Department's statement is that despite all the promises of "change and reform", the Dept of Transport 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR REJECTS DEPT OF TRANSPORT CLAIMS
still won't tackle the high cost DAA monopoly, which the DOT supports and protects. At a time when other airports 
in Europe are lowering costs and growing, the DAA monopoly is increasing costs and its traffic is declining. 
Shannon's traffic for example is now 50% less than it was just 2 years ago.
 "Ryanair will continue to work with Minister Varadkar to persuade him that the blockage to tourism and jobs growth 
in Ireland is the travel tax and the DAA's high airport fees. The way forward is to copy current UK policy, where the 
Competition Commission has demanded that the BAA monopoly be broken up, because the BAA monopoly and its 
inadequate regulatory regime has "adversely affected competition". Wasting millions on tourism marketing didn't 
work under the last Fianna Fail Government, so it is sad to see the new Government following this doomed policy 
and failing to deliver on its promise of "change and reform"."

 RYANAIR CONFIRMS INCREASED AIR PASSENGER DUTY Will Devastate UK TOURISM
 Ryanair today (Tuesday,  25th November 2008) condemned the UK Government's
 increase in air passenger duty (APD) for short haul traffic from GBP10 to GBP11
 in 2009 and GBP12 in 2010 as regressive, damaging to the UK tourism industry
 (when visitor numbers are already falling) and devastating for regional airports
 where passengers and visitors demand low fares and are most price sensitive.
Ryanair blasted the tax which had been billed as an environmental tax since it
 was introduced confirming that not one penny of the tax has done anything to
 address environmental issues.  Ryanair pointed out that the tax fails to reward
 airlines, such as Ryanair, which invest in brand new aircraft and operate
 younger, cleaner, more environmentally friendly aircraft.
Ryanair confirmed that it will now enter into discussions with regional airports
 about the future viability of passenger traffic and growth in light of this
 increased cost.  Ryanair highlighted that its average fare during the winter at
 regional airports is just GBP10 with Ryanair absorbing the current GBP10 tax.
 However Ryanair warned that it will be unable to continue to absorb taxes which
 continue to increase the cost of air travel.
Ryanair released 1 million GBP10 seats for travel in December, January and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Increased APD Will Devastate UK Tourism
 February to highlight that the need to keep average fares low during the winter
 months and to underline the damage this tax will have to UK regional airports
 where passengers are most price sensitive.  Ryanair encouraged passengers to log
 on to www.ryanair.com before midnight Sunday to secure one of these GBP10 seats
 while they still can.
Calling today for an urgent rethink on increasing airport passenger duty,
 Ryanair's Michael Cawley said:
"This Government must realise that it can't tax the tourism industry out of a
 recession.  BAA traffic figures show that passenger traffic has fallen since
 this tax was introduced and this increase will have a further damaging effect on
 passengers.  BAA traffic fell by 5% in September and 6% in October with the
 first 10 months of the year showing a decline of 2%.  As Ryanair has repeatedly
 shown, the tourism industry can only grow and thrive if it has lower access
 costs and not idiotic regressive taxation which hits the poorest, most price
 sensitive passengers, and makes UK tourism an increasingly unattractive option.
 "Our greatest concern is the devastation this regressive tax will have on our
 regional bases, which we have grown due to Ryanair's commitment to lowering
 fares.  The Government is insane if it thinks these price sensitive passengers
 will continue to travel if faced with increased costs.  We have released
 1million GBP10 fares to demonstrate the need for airfares, airport charges and
 so called environmental taxes to be kept low in order to keep passengers
 travelling - especially during the winter and the current recession.  I urge
 passengers to log on to www.ryanair.com before midnight Sunday (30th Nov) to
 secure one of these GBP10 seats".
Ends.                                                               Tuesday,

   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting 
rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.
   (x) Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares

   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.

 RYANAIR FULL YEAR PROFIT JUMPS 66% TO EUR867M
 Lower Fares & "Always Getting Better" Services Delivers Record Results
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today (May 26) announced a full year net profit of EUR867m, ahead of 
previous guidance.

Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
 "We are pleased to celebrate Ryanair's 30(th) Birthday by reporting this 66% increase in net profit which 
demonstrates the enduring strength of Ryanair's lowest fare/lowest cost model which has been transformed 
by the success of our "Always Getting Better" (AGB) customer experience programme.  AGB has attracted 
millions of new customers to Ryanair.
 Highlights of the past year include;
 -    Traffic up 11% to 90.6m as load factors rose from 83% to 88%
 -    Unit costs ex fuel were flat (including fuel they fell 5%)
 -    Net profits rose 66% as net margin jumped from 10% to 15%
 -    Earlier loading of schedules led to materially stronger forward bookings
 -    AGB Year 1 programme delivered, Year 2 improvements rolled out
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
 -    Ryanair Labs is transforming our digital and mobile platforms
 -    Lead customer order for 200 x B737 Max 200 aircraft
 -    2(nd) Eurobond issue (EUR850m @ 1.125% coupon) lowers our finance costs.
 Business Development:
 Over the past year we have relentlessly improved our lowest fare/lowest cost model.   We have expanded 
into primary airports, added business schedules and extended long term low cost growth deals at major 
bases including London (STN) and Dublin where the Irish Govt has rebooted tourism by abolishing the travel 
tax.
 Our AGB programme is transforming our customer experience, our service, and the way we listen and respond 
to our customers. We have won substantial traffic and share gains in all markets.  We are now the No.1 or 
No.2 airline in most EU countries except France and Germany (where we are a rapidly growing No.3).  Since 
our Year 1 AGB programme has been so successful we have launched our Year 2 programme as part of our 
strategy to make Ryanair Europe's most customer friendly, as well as its lowest fare, airline.
 This combination of lowest fares and improving customer experience has led to higher load factors and 
double digit traffic growth.  To facilitate this growth we have ordered 183 B737-800's for delivery from 
2014-2018, and 200 B737 Max 200's from 2019-2023 (including 100 option aircraft).  These aircraft will 
deliver at lower US$ rates and much lower Eurobond finance rates which (with 8 extra seats and 18% more 
efficient engines) will transform our aircraft costs and enable us to lower fares, which underpins our 
traffic and market share growth, while maintaining and/or growing margins.
 Operations:
 Our summer 2015 fleet of 320 aircraft is insufficient to handle the demand for Ryanair's low fares.  We 
will lease-in 6 aircraft in the peak period (7 in 2014) to help meet this surging demand. We expect over 
half of our growth to occur at primary airports such as Brussels, Lisbon, Rome, Athens, Copenhagen, 
Berlin, Cologne, Dublin and London (STN).  Much of this growth is being stimulated by our Business Plus 
and Family Extra services which have been key features of our AGB programme and our successful 
entry/growth at these primary airports.
 We continue to deliver industry leading punctuality despite the occasional and repeated damage inflicted 
on our operations by unjustified ATC strikes and airspace closures or by adverse weather in different 
European regions during the winter schedule as follows:-
Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec   Jan   Feb   Mar   Ave
 ------  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----
 FY14    93%   94%   92%   92%   94%   92%   91%   93%   85%   92%   90%   92%   92%
 ------  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----
 FY15    91%   89%   87%   86%   90%   90%   92%   91%   84%   85%   91%   92%   90%
 ------  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----
Last year we set out a strategy to drive stronger forward bookings, encourage customers to book earlier to 
avail of lower prices and deliver higher load factors. These higher load factors have helped to reduce 
unit costs and boosted ancillary sales.  I am pleased that forward bookings, as we enter the S15 peak 
(June to Sept), are on average 4% ahead of last year, and we expect this will lead to a 2% points rise in 
load factors from 88% to 90% in FY16 especially as customers enjoy our AGB service improvements.
 Revenue and Costs:
 We celebrate the 30(th) anniversary of Ryanair first bringing low fares to Europe (8(th) July 1985) by 
growing our traffic 11% to 90.6m customers.  This generated revenue growth of 12% which was a pleasing 
result given we had no new aircraft deliveries in summer 2014. Ancillary revenues grew at a slightly 
faster rate than traffic so total revenue rose 12% to over EUR5.6bn.
 Unit costs which benefited from lower unhedged fuel prices (10% of volume) fell by 5%. Excluding fuel our 
unit costs were flat, which was an impressive performance in a year where we made a substantial move to 
more expensive primary airports without compromising our 25 minute turnarounds.  The fact that we 
maintained flat unit costs (ex-fuel) while many competitors saw their unit costs rise means that our cost 
leadership over competitors has widened during the last year.  This bodes well for our growth, especially 
as we move into airports and routes where our competitors are charging markedly higher fares.  This price 
advantage has helped Ryanair win substantial market share from competitor airlines in Dublin and London 
(STN), in particular.
 Hedging:
 Over the last year we have taken advantage of currency and fuel price weakness where possible, to 
establish a very favourable hedge position as follows:
 -    oil is 90% hedged for FY16 at $92 pbl
 -    oil is 36% hedged for FY17 at $69 pbl
 -    US$ OpEx is 90% hedged for FY16 & FY17 at $1.33 & $1.19 respectively
 -    US$ CapEx is 100% hedged for FY16, FY17 & FY18 at $1.37, $1.34 & $1.23 respectively
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
 This favourable US$ hedging will deliver significant aircraft, maintenance and fuel savings over the next 
2 years, even before we engage in further oil hedging during periods of price weakness.
 Balance Sheet and Shareholder Returns:
 Our rising profits are generating significant free cash flows, which has enabled us to deliver 
substantial returns to shareholders.  In Feb. 2015 we paid our 3(rd) special dividend of EUR520m (EUR0.37 
per share) and then launched our 6(th) share buyback under which we hope to buy and retire EUR400m of 
ordinary shares by the end of August.  This will bring the cash returned to shareholders over the past 8 
years to almost EUR3billion.
 Despite these pay-outs we still finished the year with EUR364m in net cash and a balance sheet rated BBB+ 
by both S&P and Fitch Ratings, the highest rating of any airline worldwide.  We expect our Eurobond 
programme, (under which we have raised EUR1.7bn unsecured at blended rates of 1.50% p.a.) will lower our 
financing costs, boost profitability and continue to strengthen our balance sheet.
 Regulation:
 Europe's airline industry continues to be blighted by over-regulation which frequently places producer 
monopoly protection above the interest of consumers, or growth in tourism and jobs. Examples such as 
Europe's discredited ETS system, the shambles of our single sky project and the failure to prohibit ATC 
strikes (either by "no strike" legislation, or binding arbitration) allows the ATC Unions to regularly and 
repeatedly close Europe's skies.
 The UK CMA's 2013 divestment ruling under which this UK regulator orders one Irish airline to reduce its 
minority stake in another, solely on the basis of "secret" evidence that no other airline would bid for 
Aer Lingus while Ryanair held a minority 29.8% shareholding, has now been hopelessly disproven by IAG's 
offer.  We have written to the CMA calling on them to reverse this ruling but have been amazed that they 
(in their provisional decision) have claimed that the IAG bid for Aer Lingus (which they predicted would 
not happen) is not a "change of circumstances".  We believe the CMA will be totally discredited if they do 
not reverse this manifestly erroneous ruling.
 In the meantime our approach to the IAG offer remains unchanged.  The Board of Ryanair will consider any 
offer (should we receive one) from IAG on its merits, if or when it is received.
 Ryanair strongly supports the development of additional runway capacity in the London market. We believe 
that the market should be free to develop 3 new runways, one each at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted which 
is the only long term solution to the capacity crisis in the South East, and which will encourage all 3 
airports to deliver additional capacity quickly and cost efficiently.

Body
 Ryanair Has Decided to Seasonally Ground Aircraft. In recent years, in response to an operating environment 
characterized by high fuel prices, typically lower winter yields and higher airport charges and/or taxes, Ryanair has 
adopted a policy of grounding a certain portion of its fleet during the winter months (from November to March). In 
the winter of fiscal year 2012, Ryanair grounded approximately 80 aircraft and the Company announced in May 
2012 that it intends to again ground approximately 80 aircraft during the coming winter.
 Ryanair's adoption of the policy of seasonally grounding aircraft presents some risks. While the Company seeks to 
implement its seasonal grounding policy in a way that will allow it to reduce losses by operating flights to high cost 
airports at low winter yields, there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful. Additionally, the 
Company's growth has been largely dependent on increasing capacity, and decreasing winter capacity may affect 
the overall future growth of the Company. Further, while seasonal grounding does reduce the Company's variable 
operating costs, it does not avoid fixed costs such as aircraft ownership costs and some staff costs, and it also 
decreases Ryanair's potential to earn ancillary revenues. Decreasing the number and frequency of flights may also 
negatively affect the Company's labor relations, including its ability to attract flight personnel interested in full-time 
employment. Such risks could lead to negative effects on the Company's financial condition and/or results of 
operations.
 Risks Associated with the Euro. Ryanair is headquartered in Ireland and its reporting currency is the euro. As a 
result of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the eurozone debt crisis, there has been widespread speculation that 
some member states could exit the euro or that there may be a potential break-up of the eurozone currency union, 
including with regard to Ireland, the country in which Ryanair is headquartered. If a eurozone participating member 
state were to leave the eurozone, there is a risk of contagion spreading to the remaining members. Ryanair 
predominantly operates to/from countries within the eurozone and has significant operational and financial 
exposures to the eurozone that could result in a reduction in the operating performance of the Company or the 
devaluation of certain assets.  See "Item 4 - Strategy for further information". The Company has taken certain risk 
management measures to minimise any disruptions, however these risk management measures may fail to address 
the potential fall-out from a break-up of the euro or an exit by one of the eurozone members.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -16-
 Ryanair has cash and aircraft assets and debt liabilities that are denominated in euro on its balance sheet. In 
addition the positive/negative mark-to-market on derivative based transactions are recorded in euro as either assets 
or liabilities on Ryanair's balance sheet. A potential exit of a member state or the break-up of the eurozone could 
have a materially adverse effect on the value of these assets and liabilities. In addition to the assets and liabilities 
on Ryanair's balance sheet, Ryanair has a number of cross currency risks as a result of the jurisdictions of the 
operating business including non-euro revenues, fuel costs, certain maintenance costs and insurance costs. A 
weakening in the value of the euro primarily against U.K. pound sterling and U.S. dollar but also against other non-
eurozone European currencies and Moroccan Dirhams, could negatively impact the operating results of the 
Company.
 Currency Fluctuations Affect the Company's Results. Although the Company is headquartered in Ireland, a 
significant portion of its operations is conducted in the U.K. Consequently, the Company has significant operating 
revenues and operating expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, denominated in U.K. pounds sterling. In 
addition, fuel, aircraft, insurance, and some maintenance obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars. The 
Company's results of operations and financial condition can therefore be significantly affected by fluctuations in the 
respective values of the U.K. pound sterling and the U.S. dollar. Ryanair is particularly subject to direct exchange 
rate risks between the euro and the U.S. dollar because a significant portion of its operating costs are incurred in 
U.S. dollars and none of its revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars.
 Although the Company engages in foreign currency hedging transactions between the euro and the U.S. dollar, 
between the euro and the U.K. pound sterling, and between the U.K. pound sterling and the U.S. dollar, hedging 
activities cannot be expected to eliminate currency risks. See "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures 
About Market Risk."
 The Company May Not Be Successful in Increasing Fares and Revenues to Offset Higher Business Costs. Ryanair 
operates a low-fares airline. The success of its business model depends on its ability to control costs so as to 
deliver low fares while at the same time earning a profit. The Company has limited control over its fuel costs and 
already has comparatively low other operating costs. In periods of high fuel costs, if the Company is unable to 
further reduce its other operating costs or generate additional revenues, operating profits are likely to fall. The 
Company cannot offer any assurances regarding its future profitability. See "-The Company Faces Significant Price 
and Other Pressures in a Highly Competitive Environment" below and "-Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel Availability 
Affect the Company's Results and Increase the Likelihood that the Company May Incur Additional Losses" above.
 The Company is Subject to Legal Proceedings Alleging State Aid at Certain Airports. Formal investigations are 
ongoing by the European Commission into Ryanair's agreements with the Lubeck, Berlin (Schonefeld), Alghero, 
Pau, Aarhus, Frankfurt (Hahn), Dusseldorf (Weeze), Zweibrucken, Altenburg, Klagenfurt, Stockholm (Vasteras), 
Paris (Beauvais), La Rochelle, Carcassonne, Nimes, Angouleme, Marseille and Brussels (Charleroi) airports. The 
investigations seek to determine whether the arrangements constitute illegal state aid. The investigations are 
expected to be completed in late 2012/early 2013, with the European Commission's decisions being appealable to 
the EU General Court. In addition to the European Commission investigations, Ryanair is facing allegations that it 
has benefited from unlawful state aid in a number of court cases, including in relation to its arrangements with 
Frankfurt (Hahn) and Lubeck airports. Adverse rulings in these matters could be used as precedents by competitors 
to challenge Ryanair's agreements with other publicly owned airports and could cause Ryanair to strongly 
reconsider its growth strategy in relation to public or state-owned airports across Europe. This could in turn lead to a 
scaling-back of Ryanair's overall growth strategy due to the smaller number of privately owned airports available for 
development.
 No assurance can be given as to the outcome of legal proceedings, nor as to whether any unfavorable outcomes 
may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the results of operation or financial condition 
of the Company. For additional information, please see "Item 8. Financial Information[3/4]Other Financial 
Information[3/4]Legal Proceedings."
 The Company Faces Significant Price and Other Pressures in a Highly Competitive Environment. Ryanair operates 
in a highly competitive marketplace, with a number of low-fare, traditional and charter airlines competing throughout 
the route network. Airlines compete primarily with respect to fare levels, frequency and dependability of service, 
name recognition, passenger amenities (such as access to frequent flyer programs), and the availability and 
convenience of other passenger services. Unlike Ryanair, certain of Ryanair's competitors are state-owned or state-
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -16-
controlled flag carriers and in some cases may have greater name recognition and resources and may have 
received, or may receive in the future, significant amounts of subsidies and other state aid from their respective 
governments. In addition, the EU-U.S. Open Skies Agreement, which entered into effect in March 2008, allows U.S. 
carriers to offer services in the intra-EU market, which should eventually result in increased competition. See "Item 
4. Information on the Company-Government Regulation-Liberalization of the EU Air Transportation Market."
 The airline industry is highly susceptible to price discounting, in part because airlines incur very low marginal costs 
for providing service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats. Both low-fare and traditional airlines 
sometimes offer low fares in direct competition with Ryanair across a significant proportion of its route network as a 
result of the liberalization of the EU air transport market and greater public acceptance of the low-fares model.  
Although Ryanair's Yield per Available Seat Mile ("YASM") increased by approximately 10% in the 2012 fiscal year 
and by approximately 3% in the 2011 fiscal year, it decreased by approximately 13% in the 2010 fiscal year, and 
there can be no assurance that it will not decrease in future periods.
 Although Ryanair intends to compete vigorously and to assert its rights against any predatory pricing or other 
conduct, price competition among airlines could reduce the level of fares or passenger traffic on the Company's 
routes to the point where profitability may not be achievable.
 In addition to traditional competition among airline companies and charter operators who have entered the low-
fares market, the industry also faces competition from ground transportation (including high-speed rail systems) and 
sea transportation alternatives, as businesses and recreational travelers seek substitutes for air travel.

 RYANAIR LAUNCHES HIGH COURT ACTION ON BEHALF OF CONSUMERS TO PREVENT EDREAMS & 
GOOGLE DECEIVING CONSUMERS WITH MISLEADING ADVERTS AND FALSE PRICES
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (1 Dec) announced that it had launched High Court proceedings against 
both eDreams and Google to stop them misleading consumers by advertising non-existent Ryanair fares via the 
eDreams website and Google search adverts. These practises are prohibited by consumer legislation. As a result, 
Ryanair has also put the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission on notice of the proceedings.
 Screenscraper website eDreams has been allowed by Google to use the misleading subdomains "Ryanair Cheap 
Flights" and "www.Ryanair.eDreams.com", and a copycat website with identical Ryanair branding, in order to 
deceive consumers into visiting the eDreams website, and booking with eDreams at inflated fares.
 Ryanair has engaged in several legal cases across Europe against screenscraper websites such as eDreams to 
prevent consumers from being deceived and subjected to false prices and hidden charges. Consumers are also 
faced with a range of problems when booking through eDreams, such as checked in bags not being recorded, 
contact details being omitted and additional passengers not being recognised or added to the booking.
 Ryanair has no issues with Google selling advertising space, but has repeatedly called on Google to enforce 
transparency on its online advertising following numerous complaints from Ryanair customers who were deceived 
into buying on the eDreams website when they thought they were booking on Ryanair.com. Following Google's 
refusal to stop these false advertising practices (which are in breach of Google's own code of conduct), Ryanair has 
been left with no alternative than to take legal proceedings against both eDreams and Google in the Irish High 
Courts.
 Ryanair's CMO Kenny Jacobs said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR TAKES LEGAL CASE AGAINST EDREAMS & GOOGLE
 "This Google/eDreams action is a repeat of a recently successful German court ruling which has outlawed 
eDreams deceptive advertising in Germany. This deception and mis-selling has led to a surge of consumer 
complaints and leaves Ryanair with no choice but to take legal action against both Google and eDreams, who 
continue to use Google search adverts to deceive consumers into booking Ryanair flights on the eDreams website 
at inflated fares. Both the subdomain eDreams uses, and the branding and design it employs on this site, are a 
deliberate attempt to dupe consumers into thinking they are directly booking Ryanair's low fares.
 Ryanair has no commercial agreement with eDreams, who continue to advertise false fares and unlawfully mis-
sells Ryanair fares with hidden handling fees. Our repeated calls for greater Google advert transparency, or for 
Google to comply with their own code of conduct, have been ignored, and in order to prevent 1,000's more 
consumers being misled on the Google search engine, we have commenced these High Court proceedings.
 We have no problem with Google charging advertisers on its paid search function, but we expect Google to ensure 
that this advertising is honest and transparent (namely that eDreams advertises as "eDreams" and not as Ryanair), 
which is what Google's own code of conduct requires and which will prevent more ordinary consumers being 
deceived by this false and unlawful advertising scam. The German courts have already outlawed this eDreams 
false advertising, and its time the Irish and UK courts did the same to protect consumers."

RYANAIR ANNOUNCES FOUR NEW ROUTES AND INCREASED CAPACITY FROM STOCKHOLM
Increased capacity to Berlin, Eindhoven, Milan and Riga
New routes to Krakow, Lodz, Prague and Wroclaw
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Tuesday, 15th July)
announced four new routes from its Stockholm base to Krakow, Lodz, Prague and
Wroclaw. Ryanair also announced an increase in traffic to Berlin, Eindhoven
Milan and Riga. These new routes will start in October.
Announcing these four new routes, Dara Brady, Ryanair's Head of Advertising
said:
"Ryanair's low fares in Sweden have been a tremendous success because Swedish
passengers can't stand SAS's high fares and fuel surcharges. With these new
routes Ryanair will carry 2.5 million passengers annually to and from Stockholm
Skavsta for a small fraction of SAS's high fares, generating a visitor spend of
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces New Routes & Increased Capacity
5 billion SEK in the region.
"Only Ryanair guarantees the lowest fares* from Sweden. If any passenger finds a
lower fare with another airline on the same route, Ryanair will refund double
the difference. To celebrate these new routes, we are giving 400 Sek discount on
all our return fares on all our flights. We urge all passengers to log onto
www.ryanair.com immediately, as seats this cheap will sell out fast."

 Independence. NASDAQ requires that a majority of an issuer's Board of Directors be "independent" under the 
standards set forth in the NASDAQ rules and that directors deemed independent be identified in the Company's 
annual report on Form 20-F. The Board of Directors has determined that each of the Company's nine non-executive 
directors is "independent" under the standards set forth in the UK Corporate Governance Code.  Under the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, there is no bright-line test establishing set criteria for independence, as there is under 
NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(12). Instead, the Board of Directors determines whether the director is "independent in 
character and judgment," and whether there are relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could 
appear to affect, the director's judgment. Under the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board of Directors may 
determine that a director is independent notwithstanding the existence of relationships or circumstances which may 
appear relevant to its determination, but it should state its reasons if it makes such a determination. The UK 
Corporate Governance Code specifies that relationships or circumstances that may be relevant include whether the 
director: (i) has been an employee of the relevant company or group within the last five years; (ii) has had within the 
last three years a direct or indirect material business relationship with such company; (iii) has received payments 
from such company, subject to certain exceptions; (iv) has close family ties with any of the company's advisers, 
directors or senior employees; (v) holds cross-directorships or other significant links with other directors; (vi) 
represents a significant shareholder; or (vii) has served on the Board of Directors for more than nine years. 
In determining that each of the nine non-executive directors is independent under the UK Corporate Governance 
Code standard, the Ryanair Holdings Board of Directors identified such relevant factors with respect to non-
executive directors Messrs. Bonderman, McLaughlin, Osborne and Horgan. The Board has considered Kyran 
McLaughlin's independence given his role as Deputy Chairman and Head of Capital Markets at Davy Stockbrokers. 
Davy Stockbrokers are one of Ryanair's corporate brokers and provide corporate advisory services to Ryanair from 
time to time. The Board has considered the fees paid to Davy Stockbrokers for these services and believe that they 
are immaterial to both Ryanair and Davy Stockbrokers given the size of each organisation's business operations 
and financial results. Having considered this relationship, the Board has concluded that Kyran McLaughlin 
continues to be an independent non-executive director within the spirit and meaning of the 2012 Code Rules. The 
Board has also considered the independence of David Bonderman given his shareholding in Ryanair Holdings plc. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -46-
As at March 31, 2014, David Bonderman had a beneficial shareholding in the Company of 7,655,671 ordinary 
shares, equivalent to 0.55% of the issued share capital. Having considered this shareholding in light of the number 
of issued shares in Ryanair Holdings plc and the financial interest of the director, the Board has concluded that the 
interest is not so material as to breach the spirit of the independence rule contained in the 2012 Code. The Board 
has further considered the independence of Messrs. David Bonderman, James Osborne, Kyran McLaughlin and 
Michael Horgan as they have each served more than nine years on the Board. The Board considers that each of 
these directors is independent in character and judgment as they either have other significant commercial and 
professional commitments and/or brings his own level of senior experience gained in their fields of international 
business and professional practice. When arriving at this decision, the Board has taken into account the comments 
made by the Financial Reporting Council in their report dated December, 2009 on their review of the impact and 
effectiveness of the Code, in particular their comment that independence is not the primary consideration when 
assessing the composition of the Board, and that the over-riding consideration should be that the Board is fit for 
purpose. For these reasons, and also because each director's independence is considered annually by the Board, 
the Board considers it appropriate that these directors have not been offered for annual re-election as is 
recommended by the 2012 Code. When arriving at the decision that these directors are nonetheless independent, 
the Board of Directors has taken into account the comments made by the Financial Reporting Council in its report 
dated December 2009 on its review of the impact and effectiveness of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The 
NASDAQ independence criteria specifically state that an individual may not be considered independent if, within the 
last three years, such individual or a member of his or her immediate family has had certain specified relationships 
with the company, its parent, any consolidated subsidiary, its internal or external auditors, or any company that has 
significant business relationships with the company, its parent or any consolidated subsidiary. Neither ownership of 
a significant amount of stock nor length of service on the board is a per se bar to independence under the NASDAQ 
rules.

Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -32-
London Stock Exchange Aggregated Regulatory News Service (ARNS)

Length: 1567 words
Body
 Pursuant to the Irish Aviation Authority (Nationality and Registration of Aircraft) Order 2002 (the 
"Order"), the IAA regulates the registration of aircraft in Ireland. In order to be registered or continue 
to be registered in Ireland, an aircraft must be wholly owned by either (i) a citizen of Ireland or a 
citizen of another member state of the EU having a place of residence or business in Ireland or (ii) a 
company registered in and having a place of business in Ireland and having its principal place of business 
in Ireland or another member state of the EU and not less than two-thirds of the directors of which are 
citizens of Ireland or of another member state of the EU. As of the date of this report, seven of the nine 
directors of Ryanair Holdings are citizens of Ireland or of another member state of the EU. An aircraft 
will also fulfill these conditions if it is wholly owned by such citizens or companies in combination. 
Notwithstanding the fact that these particular conditions may not be met, the IAA retains discretion to 
register an aircraft in Ireland so long as it is in compliance with the other conditions for registration 
under the Order. Any such registration may, however, be made subject to certain conditions. In order to be 
registered, an aircraft must also continue to comply with any applicable provisions of Irish law. The 
registration of any aircraft can be cancelled if it is found that it is not in compliance with the 
requirements for registration under the Order and, in particular: (i) if the ownership requirements are 
not met; (ii) if the aircraft has failed to comply with any applicable safety requirements specified by 
the IAA in relation to the aircraft or aircraft of a similar type; or (iii) if the IAA decides in any case 
that it is not in the public interest for the aircraft to remain registered in Ireland.
 Regulation of Competition
 Competition/Antitrust Law. It is a general principle of EU competition law that no agreement may be 
concluded between two or more separate economic undertakings that prevents, restricts or distorts 
competition in the common market or any part of the common market. Such an arrangement may nevertheless be 
exempted by the European Commission, on either an individual or category basis. The second general 
principle of EU competition law is that any business or businesses having a dominant position in the EU 
common market or any substantial part of the common market may not abuse such dominant position. Ryanair 
is subject to the application of the general rules of EU competition law as well as specific rules on 
competition in the airline sector.
 An aggrieved person may sue for breach of EU competition law in the courts of a member state and/or 
petition the European Commission for an order to put an end to the breach of competition law. The European 
Commission also may impose fines and daily penalties on businesses and the courts of the member states may 
award damages and other remedies (such as injunctions) in appropriate circumstances.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -32-
 Competition law in Ireland is primarily embodied in the Competition Act 2002. This Act is modeled on the 
EU competition law system. The Irish rules generally prohibit anti-competitive arrangements among 
businesses and prohibit the abuse of a dominant position. These rules are enforced either by public 
enforcement (primarily by the Competition Authority) through both criminal and civil sanctions or by 
private action in the courts. These rules apply to the airline sector, but are subject to EU rules that 
override any contrary provisions of Irish competition law. Ryanair has been subject to an abuse-of-
dominance investigation by the Irish Competition Authority in relation to service between Dublin and Cork. 
The Competition Authority closed its investigation in July 2009 with a finding in favor of Ryanair.
 State Aid. The EU rules control aid granted by member states to businesses on a selective or 
discriminatory basis. The EU Treaty prevents member states from granting such aid unless approved in 
advance by the EU. Any such grant of state aid to an airline is subject to challenge before the EU or, in 
certain circumstances, national courts. If aid is held to have been unlawfully granted it may have to be 
repaid by the airline to the granting member state, together with interest thereon. See "Item 3. Key 
Information[3/4]Risk Factors[3/4]Risks Related to the Company-The Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings 
Alleging State Aid at Certain Airports" and "Item 8. Financial Information[3/4]Other Financial 
Information[3/4]Legal Proceedings."
 Environmental Regulation
 Aircraft Noise Regulations. Ryanair is subject to international, national and, in some cases, local noise 
regulation standards. EU and Irish regulations have required that all aircraft operated by Ryanair comply 
with Stage 3 noise requirements since April 1, 2002. All of Ryanair's aircraft currently comply with these 
regulations. Certain airports in the U.K. (including London Stansted and London Gatwick) and continental 
Europe have established local noise restrictions, including limits on the number of hourly or daily 
operations or the time of such operations.
 Company Facilities. Environmental controls are generally imposed under Irish law through property 
planning legislation, specifically the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts of 1963 to 1999, 
the Planning and Development Act 2000 and regulations made thereunder. At Dublin Airport, Ryanair operates 
on land controlled by the DAA. Planning permission for its facilities has been granted in accordance with 
both the zoning and planning requirements of Dublin Airport. There is also specific Irish environmental 
legislation implementing applicable EU directives and regulations, to which Ryanair adheres. From time to 
time, noxious or potentially toxic substances are held on a temporary basis within Ryanair's engineering 
facilities at Dublin Airport, Glasgow (Prestwick), London (Stansted), Frankfurt (Hahn), Stockholm 
(Skavsta), Oslo (Rygge) and Kaunas. However, at all times Ryanair's storage and handling of these 
substances complies with the relevant regulatory requirements. At Ryanair's Glasgow (Prestwick) and London 
(Stansted) maintenance facilities, all normal waste is removed in accordance with the Environmental 
Protection Act of 1996 and Duty of Care Waste Regulations. For special waste removal, Ryanair operates 
under the Special Waste Regulations 1998. At all other facilities Ryanair adheres to all local and EU 
regulations.
 Ryanair's Policy on Noise and Emissions. Ryanair is committed to reducing emissions and noise through 
investments in "next generation" aircraft and engine technologies and the implementation of certain 
operational and commercial decisions to minimize the environmental impact of its operations. According to 
the latest Air Travel Carbon and Energy Efficiency Report published by Brighter Planet, Ryanair is the 
industry leader in terms of environmental efficiency, and the Company is constantly working towards 
improving its performance.
 In December 2005, Ryanair completed the fleet replacement program it commenced in 1999. All of Ryanair's 
older Boeing 737-200A aircraft were replaced with Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft, and Ryanair 
now operates a single-aircraft-type fleet of Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft with an average age 
of just over 3.8 years. The design of the new aircraft is aimed at minimizing drag, thereby reducing the 
rate of fuel burn and noise levels. The engines are also quieter and more fuel-efficient. Furthermore, by 
moving to an all Boeing 737-800 "next generation" fleet, Ryanair reduced the unit emissions per passenger 
due to the inherent capacity increase in the Boeing 737-800 aircraft. The Boeing 737-800 "next generation" 
aircraft have a significantly superior fuel-burn to passenger-kilometer ratio than Ryanair's former fleet 
of Boeing 737-200A aircraft. See "-Aircraft" above for details on Ryanair's fleet plan.
 Ryanair has also installed winglets on all of its existing aircraft and all future aircraft will also be 
fitted with winglets. Winglets reduce both the rate of fuel burn and carbon dioxide emissions by 
approximately 4% and also reduce noise emissions.
 In addition, Ryanair has distinctive operational characteristics that management believes are helpful to 
the general environment. In particular, Ryanair:
 --      operates with a high-seat density of 189 seats and an all-economy configuration, as opposed to 
the 162 seats and two-class configuration of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft used by traditional network 
airlines, reducing fuel burn and emissions per seat-kilometer flown;
 --      has reduced per-passenger emissions through higher load factors;
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -32-
 --      better utilizes existing infrastructure by operating out of underutilized secondary and regional 
airports throughout Europe, which limits the use of holding patterns and taxiing times, thus reducing fuel 
burn and emissions and reducing the need for new airport infrastructure;
 --      provides direct services as opposed to connecting flights, in order to limit the need for 
passengers to transfer at main hubs and thus reduces the number of take-offs and landings per journey from 
four to two, reducing fuel burn and emissions per journey; and
 --      has no late-night departures of aircraft, reducing the impact of noise emissions.

Prime Minister SÓcrates LAUnCHES Ryanair's NEW PORTO BASE
3 aircraft, 22 routes and 2M passengerS P.A.
Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, today (Thursday, 3rd September 2009)
 celebrated the official opening of its first base in Portugal by Prime Minister,
 Mr. José Socrates. Ryanair's Porto base, its 33rd in Europe, will operate with
 three based aircraft, 22 routes and deliver 2m passengers p.a. which will
 sustain 2,000 local jobs at Porto Airport.
Prime Minister Sócrates joined Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, in urging all Irish
 voters to say 'Yes to Europe' in the referendum on October 2nd next.  Ryanair
 said that its growth from small regional Irish airline to the Europe's largest
 scheduled carrier and the creation of over 6,500 well paid jobs would not have
 been possible without the de-regulation of the airline industry by the European
 Union in 1997.
Ryanair celebrated the launch of its Porto base, by releasing 1 million FREE
 seats for travel across its European network in October and November, which are
 available for booking on www.ryanair.com until midnight Sunday (6th Sept).
Ryanair Holdings PLC Prime Minister Socrates Launches New Porto Base
In Porto, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"Ryanair is honoured that Prime Minister Sócrates has joined us to officially
 open our Porto base, which is our first in Portugal and our 33rd in Europe.
 Ryanair's 2m passengers p.a. in Porto will help to create and sustain 2,000
 local jobs. This new base demonstrates the opportunities that EU membership has
 delivered for Irish companies operating across Europe. Ryanair has become
 Europe's largest airline thanks to the de-regulation of the industry by the EU.
 A strong Europe allows small companies in countries like Ireland and Portugal to
 become world beaters, this is why I am again urging all Irish voters to say 'Sim
 à Europa' ('Yes to Europe')  on October 2nd next."
Prime Minister, José Sócrates said:
"The Portuguese Government made efforts to attract low cost airlines bringing
 new routes to obtain more tourists from more origins, contributing to economic
 development, more investments and employment. This operational base now confirms
 Porto and Northern Portugal as an even greater tourist destination, but will
 also strengthen the central role of Porto in the North-West of the Iberian
 Peninsula. The launch of this base is also a proof of confidence in the
 Portuguese economy and the recognition of the quality of our infrastructures and
 particularly in the Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport. Only the existence of a
 modern and efficient airport allowed Ryanair to install one of their operational
 bases in Portugal, which will have a significant economic impact in this region
 of the country."

Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Tuesday, 18th December 2007)

London, Manchester and Newquay as part of its biggest ever European expansion,

600 routes for Summer 2008.
Announcing this expansion, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary, said:
        "Next year almost 60 million passengers will enjoy Ryanair's guaranteed
         lowest fares across Europe. Passengers at 15 of our European bases are
         already set to benefit from this expansion, with a total of 50 new
         routes already announced for 2008. We look forward in 2008 to
         guaranteeing the lowest fares for even more European consumers as they
         save EUR6bn with Ryanair compared to the high fares and fuel surcharges
         levied by Europe's flag carriers.

RYANAIR WINS RIGHT TO CHALLENGE EXCESSIVE KNOCK SUBSIDY
Ryanair, Europe's leading low fares airline, won the right today (Tuesday, 9th
September 2008) to challenge the award of the PSO subsidy on the Knock - Dublin
route to Aer Arann. Ryanair is seeking an explanation why its offer of a smaller
subsidy, lower fares and triple the passenger numbers for the Knock route was
rejected in favour of Aer Arann's larger subsidy, higher fares and fewer
passenger numbers.
The High Court in Ireland has granted Ryanair's application for a judicial
review of the decision of the Department of Transport following the unlawful
award of a PSO (Public Service Obligation) contract for the Dublin to Knock
route to Aer Arann, following Cityjet's announcement that it would not serve the
route. Ryanair today underlined that the Minister should have called for a new
tender process in order to comply with European Regulations on the grant of PSOs
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Wins Right To Challenge Knock Subsidy
but failed to do so.
Ryanair had offered to serve this route for a much lower subsidy and with over 3
times the seat capacity but the Department rejected the offer without having
carried our a new tender.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Director of Legal & Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan,
said:
"Following Cityjet's announcement that it would not fly the Dublin - Knock
route, Ryanair immediately offered to serve this route for a much lower price to
the taxpayer and with over 3 times the passenger numbers. However the
Department rejected this offer and unlawfully granted the PSO to Aer Arann
without calling for a new tender.
"Ryanair has been a vocal critic of the Department for Transport's waste of
taxpayer funds in the area of PSOs and this is the latest example. We are
delighted that the High Court has granted our request to challenge this unlawful
decision.
"At a time of economic downturn, it is high time that the Department for
Transport stopped wasting taxes on grossly inflated PSOs by supporting the
subsidy junkie Aer Arann, which does not publish accounts yet continues to
receive massive state subsidies. The Department must instead choose the value
for money option - Ryanair!"

RYANAIR CONFIRMS THAT IT IS
 50% HEDGED FOR FIRST 3 QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2009/10
Ryanair Holdings Plc today (Wednesday, 7th January 2009) announced that it has
 recently extended its jet fuel hedging position to 50% of its requirements for
 the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2009/10.On November 3, 2008 Ryanair announced
 that it was 25% hedged for Q1 and Q2 of fiscal 2009/10 at an average cost of
 $770 per tonne (equivalent to approx. $70 pbl of crude). As a result of this
 recent increase in its hedging position, Ryanair's average cost per tonne for
 the 50% hedged in fiscal 2009/10 is $700 (equivalent to approx. $64 pbl of
 crude).  The average cost per tonne in the current year (fiscal 2008/09) was
 $1,220 (equivalent to approx. $110 pbl of crude) for the first 3 quarters.  This
 increase in Ryanair's jet fuel hedging position will deliver, on average, a 42%
 reduction in Ryanair's hedged cost per tonne compared to the same period in
 fiscal 2008/09.
Commenting on Ryanair's extended hedging position, CEO Michael O'Leary said:
"We have taken advantage of the recent fall in fuel prices to extend our hedging
 position and we now have 50% of our requirement for the first 3 Quarters of
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Fuel Hedging Position
 fiscal 2009/2010 at $700 per tonne (equivalent to approx. $64 pbl of crude).
 This will lock in a 42% reduction of our hedged fuel cost per passenger compared
 to fiscal 2008/09, and will enable Ryanair to continue to grow traffic and
 reduce fares, during these recessionary times, when most airlines are increasing
 them".

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES 20% FLIGHT CUTS AT DUBLIN AIRPORT FOR WINTER 2009
Ryanair, the World's favourite airline, today (30 July 09) announced 20% flight
 cuts at its Dublin base for the coming winter schedule (09/10). Compared to
 winter 2008/09, when Ryanair based 18 aircraft, and operated 1,200 weekly
 flights, Ryanair's Dublin schedule this winter will be cut by 22% to 14 based
 aircraft with 20% fewer flights at less than 1,000 each week.  Ryanair estimates
 that its Dublin traffic this winter will decline by a further 250,000 passengers
 compared to last winter's figures, as Dublin Airport loses over 2m passengers
 overall in 2009.
Ryanair's decision to cut based aircraft flights at Dublin Airport is for the
 following reasons:
*  Dublin is one of Ryanair's two most expensive base airports (Stansted is the
 other).
 *  Costs at the DAA monopoly continue to increase at above inflation rates.
 *  The Aviation Regulator continues to rubber stamp unjustified Dublin Airport cost
 increases while costs at most other UK and European airports are falling.
 *  The Irish Govts EUR10 tourist tax makes Ireland an uncompetitive tourist
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces 20% Flight Cuts
 destination at a time when other European Governments have scrapped their
 tourist taxes.
 *  Traffic at Dublin airport is collapsing (down 11% or 1m fewer pax in the first
 half of 2009) under the weight of these high airport fees and this stupid
 tourist tax.
The fact that the DAA monopoly are proposing further price increases at a time
 when most other UK and European airports are reducing their prices, highlights
 the damage being done to Irish aviation and tourism by this high cost,
 inefficient, badly run airport monopoly. Ryanair has repeatedly called on the
 Government to scrap the EUR10 tourist tax which has had an equally devastating
 impact on Irish tourism. Ireland cannot grow tourism by taxing tourists.  The
 Belgian and Dutch Governments have recently scrapped their tourist taxes, and
 the Spanish and Greek Governments have reduced their airport fees in some cases
 to zero this winter in order to reverse traffic declines.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said today:
"In winter 2007 Ryanair had 22 aircraft based at Dublin Airport. Last year we
 reduced this by 20% to 18 aircraft and this year we're cutting it by a further
 20% to just 14 aircraft. The high and rising costs at Dublin Airport, combined
 with an insanely stupid EUR10 tourist tax, are devastating tourism here in
 Ireland. These cuts come just  one day after Ryanair announced 39 new routes to
 the Canaries this Winter where the Spanish Government has reduced airport fees
 to zero. Last week Ryanair announced 11 new routes to Oslo airports this winter
 where again airport fees have been substantially reduced.
"The response of the Government owned DAA monopoly to this 11% traffic collapse
 is  to seek yet further price increases! The incompetent Irish Aviation
 Regulator has already proposed that Dublin airport charges for 2010 onwards will
 be "18% higher" than they would be if the DAA's traffic was not declining.
 Sadly the DAA gets rewarded by the regulator with price increases for its abject
 failure to grow and stimulate traffic.
"The Irish Government has compounded this tourism collapse by inflicting an
 insanely stupid EUR10 tourist tax on passengers at Irish airports at a time when
 the Belgian and Dutch Governments have scrapped their tourist taxes and the
 Spanish and Greek Governments have reduced their airport fees, in some cases to
 zero.  Ryanair again calls on the Irish Government to scrap this stupid EUR10
 tourist tax before even further damage is done to Irish tourism this winter".

 RUSH OF 'WORLD CUP' BOOKINGS HELPS RYANAIR SMASH MONTHLY PASSENGER RECORD
OVER 7M PASSENGERS BOOKED TO TRAVEL IN JULY - SO FAR
Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, today (16th July) confirmed that a rush
 of 'World Cup' bookings has seen over 7million passengers book to travel on its
 guaranteed lowest fares this July - a new monthly record and the first time any
 European airline will carry over 7m passengers in a single month.
Ryanair will carry more passengers to summer sun destinations in July than most
 airlines will carry during the entire summer season as its combination of
 Europe's guaranteed lowest fares and industry leading customer service, with the
 least lost bags, fewest cancelations and best on-time performance, make Ryanair
 Europe's biggest and best airline.

"Ryanair will break a new monthly passenger record by carrying over 7m
 passengers in just one month, for the first time this July.  Ryanair.com
 experienced a rush of 'World Cup' bookings every time a European team got
 knocked out of the World Cup as holiday hungry families swamped our website in
Ryanair Holdings PLC Monthly Record Smashed with 7M Passengers
 search of unbeatable summer sun deals.  The great news is that even with these
 record breaking bookings there is still time for passengers to grab one of our
 guaranteed lowest fares this summer and help push us even further into the
 record books."

                  RYANAIR IS BRITAIN'S FAVOURITE AIRLINE - AGAIN!
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Wednesday, 9th June 2004)
again confirmed that it has carried more passengers in UK/Europe than BA for May
2004. Recent passenger statistics from BA confirmed that Ryanair carried 120,000
more passengers UK/Europe than BA, making Ryanair Britain's favourite airline
for travel UK/Europe - again!
Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
        "BA passenger figures released for the month of May, confirmed UK/Europe
         passenger growth of 0.3% - compared to Ryanair's growth of 19% for the
         same period. Ryanair also has substantially better load factors compared
         to BA, with Ryanair filling 81% of available seats, while BA flew almost
         one-third empty.
        "The travelling public are voting with their feet, everyone knows that
         when it comes to giving passengers what they really want - lower fares
         and on-time flights - Ryanair beats BA time and time again".

Body
 European Commission. The European Commission is in the process of introducing an updated legislative package 
to its "single European sky policy," called "SES2+", which would lead to changes to air traffic management and 
control within the EU.  The "single European sky policy" currently consists of the Framework Regulation (Reg. (EC) 
No. 549/2004) plus three technical regulations on the provision of air navigation services, organization and use of 
the airspace and the inter-operability of the European air traffic management network. These regulations have 
recently been amended by the so-called "Single European Sky II" regulation (EU Regulation 1070/09), which 
focused on air traffic control ("ATC") performance and extended the authority of EASA to include Airports and Air 
Traffic Management. The objective of the policy is to enhance safety standards and the overall efficiency of air 
traffic in Europe, as well as to reduce the cost of air traffic control services.
 On September 6, 2005, the European Commission announced new guidelines on the financing of airports and 
start-up aid to airlines by regional airports based on its February 2004 finding in the Charleroi case, a decision that 
the EU Court of First Instance ("CFI") has since annulled in December 2008. The guidelines only apply to publicly 
owned regional airports, and place restrictions on the incentives that these airports can offer airlines to deliver 
traffic. Ryanair believes that the CFI's annulment of the Charleroi decision severely undermines these guidelines. In 
April 2014, the European Commission published final revised guidelines that better reflect the commercial reality of 
the liberalized air transport market, but still place restrictions on the incentives public airports can offer to airlines 
delivering traffic, when compared with the commercial freedom available to private airports.
 The European Union also adopted legislation on airport charges (EU Directive 2009/12), which was originally 
intended to address abusive pricing at monopoly airports. However, the legislation includes all European airports 
with over five million passengers per year. Management believes that this will likely increase the administrative 
burdens on smaller airports and may lead to higher airport charges, while the scope that exists within this Directive 
to address abuses of their dominant positions by Europe's larger airports is very limited. See "Item 7. Major 
Shareholders and Related-Party Transactions 3/4 Other Financial Information 3/4 Legal Proceedings 3/4 EU State 
Aid-Related Proceedings."
 The European Union also passed legislation calling for increased transparency in airline fares, which requires the 
inclusion of all mandatory taxes, fees, and charges in advertised prices. Ryanair currently includes this information 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -33-
in its advertised fares in all markets where it operates. However, certain regulatory authorities have alleged that 
some fees applied by airlines, including Ryanair, on an avoidable basis are in fact mandatory. Ryanair amended its 
website to include information on fees in June 2012 and incorporated further changes to meet these requirements 
on its website in August 2012 and December 2012.
 Registration of Aircraft
 Pursuant to the Irish Aviation Authority (Nationality and Registration of Aircraft) Order 2002 (the "Order"), the IAA 
regulates the registration of aircraft in Ireland. In order to be registered or continue to be registered in Ireland, an 
aircraft must be wholly owned by either (i) a citizen of Ireland or a citizen of another member state of the EU having 
a place of residence or business in Ireland or (ii) a company registered in and having a place of business in Ireland 
and having its principal place of business in Ireland or another member state of the EU and not less than two-thirds 
of the directors of which are citizens of Ireland or of another member state of the EU. As of the date of this report, 
nine of the ten directors of Ryanair Holdings are citizens of Ireland or of another member state of the EU. An aircraft 
will also fulfill these conditions if it is wholly owned by such citizens or companies in combination. Notwithstanding 
the fact that these particular conditions may not be met, the IAA retains discretion to register an aircraft in Ireland so 
long as it is in compliance with the other conditions for registration under the Order. Any such registration may, 
however, be made subject to certain conditions. In order to be registered, an aircraft must also continue to comply 
with any applicable provisions of Irish law. The registration of any aircraft can be cancelled if it is found that it is not 
in compliance with the requirements for registration under the Order and, in particular: (i) if the ownership 
requirements are not met; (ii) if the aircraft has failed to comply with any applicable safety requirements specified by 
the IAA in relation to the aircraft or aircraft of a similar type; or (iii) if the IAA decides in any case that it is not in the 
public interest for the aircraft to remain registered in Ireland.
 Regulation of Competition
 Competition/Antitrust Law. It is a general principle of EU competition law that no agreement may be concluded 
between two or more separate economic undertakings that prevents, restricts or distorts competition in the common 
market or any part of the common market. Such an arrangement may nevertheless be exempted by the European 
Commission, on either an individual or category basis. The second general principle of EU competition law is that 
any business or businesses having a dominant position in the EU common market or any substantial part of the 
common market may not abuse such dominant position. Similar competition laws apply at national level in EU 
member states. Ryanair is subject to the application of the general rules of EU competition law as well as specific 
rules on competition in the airline sector.
 An aggrieved person may sue for breach of EU competition law in the courts of a member state and/or petition the 
European Commission for an order to put an end to the breach of competition law. The European Commission also 
may impose fines and daily penalties on businesses and the courts of the member states may award damages and 
other remedies (such as injunctions) in appropriate circumstances.
 Competition law in Ireland is primarily embodied in the Competition Act 2002. This Act is modeled on the EU 
competition law system. The Irish rules generally prohibit anti-competitive arrangements among businesses and 
prohibit the abuse of a dominant position. These rules are enforced either by public enforcement (primarily by the 
Competition Authority) through both criminal and civil sanctions or by private action in the courts. These rules apply 
to the airline sector, but are subject to EU rules that override any contrary provisions of Irish competition law. 
Ryanair has been subject to an abuse-of-dominance investigation by the Irish Competition Authority in relation to 
service between Dublin and Cork. The Competition Authority closed its investigation in July 2009 with a finding in 
favor of Ryanair.
 State Aid. The EU rules control aid granted by member states to businesses on a selective or discriminatory basis. 
The EU Treaty prevents member states from granting such aid unless approved in advance by the EU. Any such 
grant of state aid to an airline is subject to challenge before the EU or, in certain circumstances, national courts. If 
aid is held to have been unlawfully granted it may have to be repaid by the airline to the granting member state, 
together with interest thereon. See "Item 3. Key Information 3/4 Risk Factors 3/4 Risks Related to the Company-
The Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings Alleging State Aid at Certain Airports" and "Item 8. Financial 
Information 3/4 Other Financial Information 3/4 Legal Proceedings."
 Environmental Regulation
 Aircraft Noise Regulations. Ryanair is subject to international, national and, in some cases, local noise regulation 
standards. EU and Irish regulations have required that all aircraft operated by Ryanair comply with Stage 3 noise 
requirements since April 1, 2002. All of Ryanair's aircraft currently comply with these regulations. Certain airports in 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -33-
the U.K. (including London Stansted and London Gatwick) and continental Europe have established local noise 
restrictions, including limits on the number of hourly or daily operations or the time of such operations.
 Company Facilities. Environmental controls are generally imposed under Irish law through property planning 
legislation, specifically the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts of 1963 to 1999, the Planning and 
Development Act 2000 and regulations made there under. At Dublin Airport, Ryanair operates on land controlled by 
the DAA. Planning permission for its facilities has been granted in accordance with both the zoning and planning 
requirements of Dublin Airport. There is also specific Irish environmental legislation implementing applicable EU 
directives and regulations, to which Ryanair adheres. From time to time, noxious or potentially toxic substances are 
held on a temporary basis within Ryanair's engineering facilities at Dublin Airport, Glasgow (Prestwick), London 
(Stansted), Frankfurt (Hahn), Stockholm (Skavsta), Oslo (Rygge) and Kaunas. However, at all times Ryanair's 
storage and handling of these substances complies with the relevant regulatory requirements. At Ryanair's 
Glasgow (Prestwick) and London (Stansted) maintenance facilities, all normal waste is removed in accordance with 
the Environmental Protection Act of 1996 and Duty of Care Waste Regulations. For special waste removal, Ryanair 
operates under the Special Waste Regulations 1998. At all other facilities Ryanair adheres to all local and EU 
regulations.

 The Company has cash and aircraft assets and debt liabilities that are denominated in euro on its balance sheet. In 
addition, the positive/negative mark-to-market value of derivative-based transactions are recorded in euro as either 
assets or liabilities on the Company's balance sheet. Uncertainty regarding the future of the Eurozone could have a 
materially adverse effect on the value of these assets and liabilities. In addition to the assets and liabilities on 
Ryanair's balance sheet, the Company has a number of cross currency risks as a result of the jurisdictions of the 
operating business including non-euro revenues, fuel costs, certain maintenance costs and insurance costs. A 
weakening in the value of the euro primarily against U.K. pound sterling and U.S. dollar, but also against other non-
Eurozone European currencies and Moroccan Dirhams, could negatively impact the operating results of the 
Company.
 Recession, austerity and uncertainty in connection with the euro could also mean that Ryanair is unable to grow. 
The recent European recession and austerity measures still in effect in several European countries could mean that 
Ryanair may be unable to expand its operations due to lack of demand for air travel.
 Risks Related to the Airline Industry
 The Airline Industry Is Particularly Sensitive to Changes in Economic Conditions: A Continued Recessionary 
Environment Would Negatively Impact Ryanair's Result of Operations. Ryanair's operations and the airline industry 
in general are sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Unfavorable economic conditions such as government 
austerity measures, the uncertainty relating to the Eurozone, high unemployment rates, constrained credit markets 
and increased business operating costs could lead to reduced spending by both leisure and business passengers. 
Unfavorable economic conditions, such as the conditions persisting as of the date hereof, also tend to impact 
Ryanair's ability to raise fares to counteract increased fuel and other operating costs. A continued recessionary 
environment, combined with austerity measures by European governments, will likely negatively impact Ryanair's 
operating results. It could also restrict the Company's ability to grow passenger volumes, secure new airports and 
launch new routes and bases, and could have a material adverse impact on its financial results.
 The Introduction of Government Taxes on Travel Could Damage Ryanair's Ability to Grow and Could Have a 
Material Adverse Impact on Operations. The U.K. government levies an Air Passenger Duty ("APD") of GBP13 per 
passenger. The tax was previously set at GBP5 per passenger, but it was increased to GBP10 per passenger in 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -22-
2007, GBP11 in 2009, GBP12 in 2010 and subsequently to GBP13 in April 2012.  The increase in this tax is thought 
to have had a negative impact on Ryanair's operating performance, both in terms of average fares paid and growth 
in passenger volumes. In 2008, the Dutch government introduced a travel tax ranging from EUR11 on short-haul 
flights to EUR45 on long-haul flights (withdrawn with effect from July 1, 2009). On March 30, 2009, the Irish 
government also introduced a EUR10 Air Travel Tax on all passengers departing from Irish airports on routes 
longer than 300 kilometers but subsequently reduced it to EUR3 on March 30, 2011. On April 1, 2014 the tax 
imposed by the Irish government was abolished. In Germany, the government introduced an air passenger tax of 
EUR8 in January 2011 which was subsequently reduced to EUR7.50 in January 2012. In Austria, the government 
also introduced an ecological air travel levy of EUR8 in January 2011. The Moroccan government has also 
introduced a similar tax (equivalent to approximately EUR9) from April 2014.
 Other governments also have introduced or may introduce similar taxes. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-
Airport Operations-Airport Charges." The introduction of government taxes on travel has had a negative impact on 
passenger volumes, particularly given the current period of decreased economic activity. The introduction of further 
government taxes on travel across Europe could have a material negative impact on Ryanair's results of operations 
as a result of price-sensitive passengers being less likely to travel.
 EU Regulation on Passenger Compensation Could Significantly Increase Related Costs. EU Regulation (EC) No. 
261/2004 requires airlines to compensate passengers (holding a valid ticket) who have been denied boarding or 
whose flight has been cancelled or delayed more than 3 hours on arrival (even where the reason for the delay or 
cancellation is beyond the control of the airline). This legislation, which came into force on February 17, 2005, 
imposes fixed levels of compensation to be paid to passengers in the event of the situations described above. In 
November 2009, the Court of Justice of the EU in the Sturgeon case decided that provisions of the legislation in 
relation to monetary compensation are not only applicable to denied boarding and flight cancellations but also to 
flight delays (over three hours on arrival). However, such provisions do not apply when the flight cancellation or 
delay (over three hours on arrival), is caused for reasons outside of the control of the airline (extraordinary 
circumstances)  such as unsafe weather conditions, air-traffic control strikes/delays, unexpected flight safety 
shortcomings, sabotage, aircraft manufacturing defects,  security risks, political instability. A recent UK court case - 
Huzar vs. Jet2 heard in the UK Court of Appeal in May 2014 has narrowed the 'extraordinary circumstances' 
defence, this case is currently on appeal to the UK Supreme Court and has a suspensory effect on all passenger 
claims brought in the UK in relation to flight delays or cancellations caused by unexpected flight safety 
shortcomings. The regulation calls for compensation of  EUR250, EUR400, or EUR600 per passenger, depending 
on the length of the flight. As Ryanair's average flight length is less than 1,500 km - the upper limit for short-haul 
flights - the amount payable is generally EUR250 per passenger. Passengers subject to flight delays over 2 hours 
are also entitled to "assistance," including meals, drinks and telephone calls, as well as hotel accommodations if the 
delay extends overnight. For delays of over five hours, the airline is also required to offer the option of a refund of 
the cost of the unused ticket. There can be no assurance that the Company will not incur a significant increase in 
costs in the future due to the impact of this legislation, if Ryanair experiences a large number of cancelled flights, 
which could occur as a result of certain types of events beyond its control. See "-Risks Related to the Airline 
Industry-Volcanic Ash Emissions Could Affect the Company and Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company's 
Results of Operations."
 EU Regulation of Emissions Trading Will Increase Costs. On November 19, 2008, the European Council of 
Ministers adopted legislation to add aviation to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme ("ETS") with effect from 2012. 
This scheme, which has thus far applied mainly to industrial companies, is a cap-and-trade system for CO(2) 
emissions to encourage industries to improve their CO(2) efficiency. Under the legislation, airlines are granted initial 
CO(2) allowances based on historical performance and a CO(2) efficiency benchmark. Any shortage of allowances 
will have to be purchased in the open market and/or at government auctions. The cost of such allowances in the 
context of the Company's energy costs are not material at current market prices. There can be no assurance that 
Ryanair will be able to obtain sufficient carbon credits or that the cost of the credits will not have a material adverse 
effect on the Company's business, operating results, and financial condition.
 Volcanic Ash Emissions Could Affect the Company and Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company's Results 
of Operations. Between April 15 and April 20, 2010 and May 4 and May 17, 2010, a significant portion of the 
airspace over northern Europe was closed by authorities as a result of safety concerns presented by emissions of 
ash from an Icelandic volcano. This closure forced Ryanair to cancel 9,490 flights. In May 2011, there were further 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -22-
periodic closures of parts of the European airspace due to emissions of ash from another Icelandic volcano, which 
resulted in the cancellation of 96 flights.
 Under the terms of Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004, described above, Ryanair has certain duties to passengers 
whose flights are cancelled. In particular, Ryanair is required to reimburse passengers who have had their flights 
cancelled for certain reasonable, documented expenses - primarily for accommodation and food.
 Volcanic emissions may happen again and could lead to further significant flight cancellation costs which could 
have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, 
volcanic emissions (whether from current or new sources) or similar atmospheric disturbances and resulting 
cancellations due to the closure of airports could also have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial 
performance indirectly, as a consequence of changes in the public's willingness to travel within Europe due to the 
risk of flight disruptions.

 Directors, Senior Management and Employees-Employees and Labor Relations." Limitations on Ryanair's flexibility 
in dealing with its employees or the altering of the public's perception of Ryanair generally could have a material 
adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results, and financial condition.
 The Company is Dependent on External Service Providers. Ryanair currently assigns its engine overhauls and 
"rotable" repairs to outside contractors approved under the terms of Part 145, the European regulatory standard for 
aircraft maintenance established by the European Aviation Safety Agency ("Part 145"). The Company also assigns 
its passenger, aircraft and ground handling services at airports other than Dublin and certain airports in Spain and 
the Canary Islands to established external service providers. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-
Maintenance 
and 
Repairs-Heavy 
Maintenance" 
and 
"Item 
4. 
Information 
on 
the 
Company-Airport 
Operations[3/4]Airport Handling Services."
 The termination or expiration of any of Ryanair's service contracts or any inability to renew them or negotiate 
replacement contracts with other service providers at comparable rates could have a material adverse effect on the 
Company's results of operations. Ryanair will need to enter into airport service agreements in any new markets it 
enters, and there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain the necessary facilities and services at 
competitive rates. In addition, although Ryanair seeks to monitor the performance of external parties that provide 
passenger and aircraft handling services, the efficiency, timeliness, and quality of contract performance by external 
providers are largely beyond Ryanair's direct control. Ryanair expects to be dependent on such outsourcing 
arrangements for the foreseeable future.
 The Company is Dependent on Key Personnel. The Company's success depends to a significant extent upon the 
efforts and abilities of its senior management team, including Michael O'Leary, the Chief Executive Officer, and key 
financial, commercial, operating and maintenance personnel. Mr. O'Leary's current contract may be terminated by 
either party upon 12 months' notice. See "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees-Compensation of 
Directors and Senior Management-Employment Agreements." The Company's success also depends on the ability 
of its executive officers and other members of senior management to operate and manage effectively, both 
independently and as a group. Although the Company's employment agreements with Mr. O'Leary and some of its 
other senior executives contain non-competition and non-disclosure provisions, there can be no assurance that 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -19-
these provisions will be enforceable in whole or in part. Competition for highly qualified personnel is intense, and 
either the loss of any executive officer, senior manager, or other key employee without adequate replacement or the 
inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business, 
operating results, and financial condition.
 The Company Faces Risks Related to its Internet Reservations Operations and its Announced Elimination of 
Airport Check-in Facilities. Approximately 99% of Ryanair's flight reservations are made through its website. 
Although the Company has established a contingency program whereby the website is hosted in three separate 
locations, each of these locations accesses the same booking engine, located at a single center, in order to make 
reservations.
 A back-up booking engine is available to Ryanair to support its existing platform in the event of a breakdown in this 
facility. Nonetheless, the process of switching over to the back-up engine could take some time and there can be no 
assurance that Ryanair would not suffer a significant loss of reservations in the event of a major breakdown of its 
booking engine or other related systems, which, in turn, could have a material adverse affect on the Company's 
operating results or financial condition.
 Since October 1, 2009, all passengers have been required to use Internet check-in. Internet check-in is part of a 
package of measures intended to reduce check-in lines and passenger handling costs and pass on these savings 
by reducing passenger airfares. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-Reservations/Ryanair.com." The 
Company has deployed this system across its network. Any disruptions to the Internet check-in service as a result 
of a breakdown in the relevant computer systems or otherwise could have a material adverse impact on these 
service-improvement and cost-reduction efforts. The result of this requirement is that Ryanair has reduced airport 
and handling costs, due to the need to have fewer check-in personnel and rented check-in desks. There can be no 
assurance, however, that this process will continue to be successful or that consumers will not switch to other 
carriers that provide standard check-in facilities, which would negatively affect the Company's results of operations 
and financial condition.
 The Company Faces Risks Related to Unauthorized Use of Information from the Company's Website. 
Screenscraper websites gain unauthorized access to Ryanair's website and booking system, extract flight and 
pricing information and display it on their own websites for sale to customers at prices which include intermediary 
fees on top of Ryanair's fares. Ryanair does not allow any such commercial use of its website and objects to the 
practice of screenscraping also on the basis of certain legal principles, such as database rights, copyright 
protection, etc. In November 2011, the Company introduced Captcha, a Google product which requires passengers 
who wish to book flights to enter a screen code to complete their bookings.  This has had a positive impact and 
reduced the level of screenscraping.  The Company is also involved in a number of legal proceedings against the 
proprietors of screenscraper websites in Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy and Switzerland. 
The Company's objective is to prevent any unauthorized use of its website, however the Company does allow 
certain companies who operate fare comparison websites to access the website provided they sign a license and 
use the agreed method to access the data.  The Company has received favorable rulings in Ireland, Germany and 
The Netherlands. However, pending the outcome of these legal proceedings and if Ryanair were to be unsuccessful 
in them, the activities of screenscraper websites could lead to a reduction in the number of customers who book 
directly on Ryanair's website and consequently in a reduction in the Company's ancillary revenue stream. Also, 
some customers may be lost to the Company once they are presented by a screenscraper website with a Ryanair 
fare inflated by the screenscraper's intermediary fee. This could also adversely affect Ryanair's reputation as a low-
fares airline, which could negatively affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. For 
additional details, see "Item 8. Financial Information-Other Financial Information-Legal Proceedings-Legal 
Proceedings Against Internet Ticket Touts."
 Irish Corporation Tax Rate Could Rise. The majority of Ryanair's profits are subject to Irish corporation tax at a 
statutory rate of 12.5%. Due to the size and scale of the Irish government's budgetary deficit and the "bailout" of the 
Irish government by a combination of loans from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union, there is 
a risk that the Irish government could increase Irish corporation tax rates above 12.5% in order to repay current or 
future loans or to increase tax revenues.
 At 12.5%, the rate of Irish corporation tax is lower than that applied by most of the other European Union member 
states, and has periodically been subject to critical comment by the governments of other EU member states. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -19-
Although the Irish government has repeatedly publicly stated that it will not increase corporation tax rates, there can 
be no assurance that such an increase in corporation tax rates will not occur.
 In the event that the Irish government increases corporation tax rates or changes the basis of calculation of 
corporation tax from the present basis, any such changes would result in Ryanair paying higher corporate taxes and 
would have an adverse impact on our cash flows, financial position and results of operations. See "-Risks Related 
to the Company-Tax audits."
 Change in EU Regulations in Relation to Employers and Employee Social Insurance Could Increase Costs.
 The European Parliament passed legislation governing the payment of employee and employer social insurance 
costs in May, 2012. The legislation was introduced in late June 2012. The legislation governs the country in which 
employees and employers must pay social insurance costs. Presently, Ryanair pays employee and employer social 
insurance in the country under whose laws the employee's contract of employment is governed, which is at this 
time either the UK or Ireland. Under the terms of this new legislation, employees and employers must pay social 
insurance in the country where the employee is based. The legislation includes grandfathering rights which means 
that existing employees should be exempt.  However, both new and existing employees who transfer from their 
present base location to a new base in another EU country will be impacted by the new rules in relation to 
employee and employer contributions. Each country within the EU has different rules and rates in relation to the 
calculation of employee and employer social insurance contributions.  Ryanair estimates that the change in 
legislation will not have any initial material impact on salary costs although it could have an adverse impact over 
time.

RYANAIR WINS INJUNCTION AGAINST ENAC (ITALIAN CAA)
PREVENTS RYANAIR CIAMPINO FLIGHTS BEING DIVERTED TO FIUMICINO
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Tuesday, 22nd July 2008)
welcomed the decision by the Italian (TAR Lazio) Court last Friday to overturn
ENAC's latest Ordinanza, which forced Ryanair's Ciampino based aircraft to
divert late at night to Rome Fiumicino, thereby disrupting the travel plans of
thousands of Italian citizens and visitors. This is the third time since 2006
that the Italian Courts have overturned unlawful Ordinanza's created by ENAC to
disrupt the operations of Ryanair's Ciampino based aircraft.
Ryanair confirmed that since January, a total of 18 flights and over 2,700
passengers had been unlawfully diverted by ENAC on late evening flights and
prevented from landing as scheduled in Rome Ciampino, and instead diverted to
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR WINS INJUNCTION AGAINST ENAC ( ITALIAN CAA)
Rome Fiumicino Airport. This meant late evening disruptions and long and
inconvenient bus journeys for Italian visitors and citizens back to
Rome Ciampino Airport to collect their cars, meet relatives etc.
None of these diversions would be necessary if ENAC (the Italian CAA) abided by
its own rules and regulations, which allow Ciampino based aircraft to land after
the midnight curfew at Rome Ciampino. The flights which are operated by the
quietest commercial aircraft in Europe, do not create any significant noise,
since they are landing flights only and do not result in a subsequent take off.
These diversions are causing untold inconvenience for Ryanair's Italian citizens
and visitors, because it means not only are the passengers on the diverted
flights inconvenienced and discommoded by ENAC, but also the passengers due to
depart from Ciampino on the early morning flight the following day typically
suffer delays of 3 to 4 hours while the aircraft positions back from Rome
Fiumicino to Rome Ciampino airport.
Ryanair believes that these unlawful Ordinanaza's by ENAC are part of ENAC's
continuing campaign to disrupt Ryanair's flights and operations in Ciampino as
part of further state subsistence being provided by ENAC to the Italian flag
carrier airline Alitalia.
Welcoming this latest injunction in the Italian Court's Ryanair's Michael
O'Leary said:
"For almost 10 years now Ryanair has been delivering significant choice,
competition and lower fares for Italian consumers and visitors, despite ENAC's
repeated unlawful attempts to limit and disrupt our operations at Ciampino
Airport. This is the third time in as many years that ENAC's conduct has been
found to be illegal and in breach of national and European regulations.
"We welcome the TAR Lazio Court's confirmation that Ryanair's aircraft can land
at Ciampino Airport after the curfew and we now call upon ENAC to put an end to
these unlawful and illegal diversions which are causing serious disruptions and
inconvenience to Ryanair's flights and Ryanair passengers.
"It is about time that ENAC, which has been one of the principal beneficiaries
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR WINS INJUNCTION AGAINST ENAC ( ITALIAN CAA)
of Ryanair's growth in Italy in recent years, recognises the enormous benefits
that Ryanair delivers to the Italian economy generally and to Rome Ciampino in
particular. Ryanair calls on the Italian Government and particularly the
Minister for Transport to demand that ENAC stops these unlawful diversions to
Fiumicino Airport, and requires ENAC to observe existing Italian law which
allows these Ciampino based aircraft to land as our passengers expect, at
Ciampino Airport".

          RYANAIR TAKES FRANCE TO THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, has today (Wednesday, 10th October
2007) challenged a recent ruling by the French supreme court (Conseil d'Etat),
which sought to deny Ryanair's employees located in Marseille the right to rely
on Irish labour law in their relationship with Ryanair.
Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs and Company Secretary, Jim Callaghan, said:
        "The 2006 French Decree No 1425 was aimed at forcing Ryanair's pilots
         and cabin crew operating international routes to/from France to be
         subject to French labour law, irrespective of the fact that they are
         working on Irish registered aircraft and contracts. This was clearly in
         breach of French, European and international laws. Ryanair is committed
         to defending the rights of its employees, including the right of its
         employees operating on Irish territory to rely on Irish labour law, and
         has therefore challenged the legality of the Decree.
        "The French supreme court, which had earlier advised the French
         government on the legality of the Decree, was also the same body that
         rejected Ryanair's request to refer this matter to the European Court of
         Justice and then ruled that the Decree was lawful. This bizarre
         confusion of consultative and judicial functions within the French
         supreme court, as well as certain other aspects of the French procedure,
Ryanair Holdings PLC TAKES FRANCE TO EURO COURT
         denied Ryanair the right to fair trial and made it necessary for us to
         seek justice in the European Court of Human Rights.
        "Ryanair is confident that the European Court of Human Rights will
         correct the obvious injustice caused by the French judicial system and
         allow Ryanair's employees working on Irish aircraft and on Irish
         contracts to continue to enjoy Ryanair's industry leading pay and
         employment conditions under Irish law".

 RYANAIR Q1 PROFITS RISE 4% TO EUR256M
 AS FARES FALL 10% TO UNDER EUR40
 Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 airline, today (July 25) reported a 4% rise in Q1 profit to EUR256m, as traffic grew 11% to 
31m while average fare fell 10% to EUR39.92, offset by a 9% reduction in unit costs.

Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "This modest 4% increase in Q1 profit to EUR256m is in line with previous guidance. The absence of Easter 
in Q1 and on-going market volatility arising from terrorist events, and repeated ATC strikes (particularly 
in France) weakened fares on close-in bookings and caused almost 1,000 flight cancellations. We remain 
committed to our load factor active/yield passive strategy which is why Q1 fares fell 10% to under EUR40. 
Traffic rose 11% and load factor improved 2 points to 94% as our Always Getting Better ("AGB") customer 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
experience programme continues to win new customers and new markets. Ancillary sales rose to 26% of 
revenues (24% in PY Q1). Cost control remains core which is why unit costs reduced 9% (ex-fuel down 4%). 
Highlights of Q1 include:
 -     Average fares cut 10% to EUR39.92
 -     Traffic up 11% to 31m (LF up 2% to 94%)
 -     Unit costs down 9% (ex-fuel -4%)
 -     Profits up 4% to EUR256m
 -     16 new B737-800's delivered
 -     Share buyback programme (EUR886m) completed in June
 New Routes and Bases:
 Our 4 new S16 bases in Belfast, Corfu, Ibiza and Santiago are performing well with strong advance 
bookings. We announced 8 new bases (Bucharest, Bournemouth, Hamburg, Nuremburg, Prague, Sofia, Timi oara 
and Vilnius) as part of our W16 schedule which will also see our Berlin base grow from 4 to 9 aircraft and 
Luxembourg become our 33(rd) country. We will open 133 new routes during W16. Sadly, the introduction of 
an NOK80 (EUR8.50) air travel tax in Norway has led to 16 route cancellations and the closure of our Oslo 
Rygge base in October.
 AGB Customer Experience:
 Year 3 of AGB was unveiled in April and continues to improve our customer experience through service, 
digital and inflight developments. In addition to lower fares and wider destination choices, our customers 
now enjoy new initiatives such as Leisure Plus, improved Business Plus (with more flexible ticketing) and 
one-flick payments on our mobile app. In June, we simplified and cut checked bag fees for 92% of our 
customers.
 Our industry leading on-time performance fell in Q1 from 91% last year to 87% due to adverse weather 
(thunder storms), and a succession of unjustified ATC strikes in Belgium, Italy, Greece and especially in 
France. UK NATS has also mismanaged its staffing rosters leading to repeated slot capacity restrictions 
and delays at London Stansted.

French ATC unions alone, have engaged in 53 strikes over the past 7 years during a period when Irish & UK 
ATC suffered zero strikes. Ryanair and other airlines have called on the European Commission to take 3 
simple measures to alleviate the impact of these ATC strikes on Europe's citizens as follows:
 a.   Require (French) ATC unions to engage in binding arbitration instead of strikes;
 b.   Allow other ATC's to operate French over-flights while their unions strike;
 c.  Allow airlines to recover their EU261 costs from these ATC providers where mismanagement permits 
repeated strikes.
 Lower Costs:
 Our cost advantage over competitors increased in Q1 as unit costs fell 9%. Fuel fell by EUR42m to EUR518m 
in Q1. Ex-fuel unit costs were cut 4% due to lower cost aircraft, cheaper financing, discounted airport 
growth deals, lower sales & marketing spend, and weaker sterling, which was partly offset by slightly 
higher staff costs as 5 year pay deals kick in across our 84 bases and our headcount rises in line with 
fleet growth.
 FY17 fuel is 95% hedged at $622 per tonne (c. $62bbl) which will (allowing for additional volumes) 
deliver fuel savings of c. EUR200m. Almost 55% of our FY18 fuel is now hedged at just under $500 per tonne 
(c. $50bbl). We expect to pass on most if not all of these fuel savings to customers in lower air fares as 
we continue to grow traffic and routes strongly.
 Shareholder Returns & Balance Sheet:
 In February we announced an EUR800m share buyback programme. After the Brexit vote, the Board increased 
this programme to EUR886m and completed it in late June at an ave. price of EUR13.48 per share. We have 
now returned over EUR4.2bn to our shareholders since 2008. On July 27 we hold an EGM to seek shareholder 
approval to give the Board discretion to engage in further selective share buybacks, if it's in the best 
interest of shareholders to do so over the next 15 months.
 Despite these buybacks our balance sheet remains strong, with net cash of EUR162m at June 30, following 
Q1 CapEx of EUR381m, debt repayments of EUR89m and buybacks of EUR468m.
 Brexit:
 The recent UK vote to leave the European Union ("EU") was both a surprise and a disappointment. Ryanair, 
as the UK's largest airline, had campaigned actively for a "Remain" vote. We expect this result will lead 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
to a considerable period of political and economic uncertainty in both the UK and the EU. This uncertainty 
will be damaging to economic growth and consumer confidence and we will respond as always with our load 
factor active/yield passive strategy. Until some clarity emerges over the next two years about the UK's 
long term political and economic relationships with the EU, we will be unable to predict what effect it 
will have on our business and regulatory environment, but we have contingency plans in place for all 
eventualities.
 In the near term we expect that Brexit uncertainty will lead to weaker sterling, slower growth in the UK 
and EU economies and downward pressure on fares until the end of 2017 at least. Over the longer term, if 
the UK is unable to negotiate access to the single market/open skies it may have implications for our 3 UK 
domestic routes and UK nationals on our share register but these risks are not material and will be 
manageable. There may also be some opportunities if our UK registered competitors are no longer permitted 
to operate intra EU routes, or must divest their majority ownership of EU registered airlines.
 In the meantime, we will pivot our growth away from UK airports and focus more on growing at our EU 
airports over the next two years. This winter we will cut capacity and frequency on many London Stansted 
routes (although no routes will close) where we are already significantly ahead of our multiyear traffic 
growth targets.
 Outlook:
 We see many growth opportunities for Ryanair's lower fares and AGB customer experience across Europe. We 
are, on average, 1% better booked for Q2 than at this time last year albeit at significantly lower fares. 
We expect load factor will be similar to last year at 93%. We now believe our FY traffic will grow by 10% 
to 117m customers (up 1m on previous guidance).
 Average fares on close-in bookings have been adversely impacted by ATC strikes, terrorist events and 
weaker sterling post Brexit. As a result, we expect Q2 fares to fall by at least 6% (H1: -8%). This 
outcome remains heavily dependent on close-in bookings for August and September. We have little visibility 
over W16 fares but see no reason-yet-to alter our guidance of -10% to -12% in H2. If there is any movement 
in these numbers it is more likely to be towards the downside.
 Ex-fuel unit costs should reduce by approx. 1% in FY17. Much of these savings will be delivered in the 
first half of the year, due to slower traffic growth this winter (particularly Q4) compared to last year. 
Our fuel bill will fall by approx. EUR200m as lower euro pricing is offset by volume growth, but it is now 
likely that most if not all of these savings will be passed on to customers in lower fares.
 At this time, we maintain our guidance, that full year profits will rise by approx. 12% to a range of 
EUR1,375m to EUR1,425m but we caution that post Brexit there are significant risks to the downside during 
the remainder of the year."

 ============  ============  =========
Fuel and oil. Ryanair's fuel and oil costs per passenger increased by 3.6%, while in absolute terms, these costs 
increased by 6.8% from EUR1,885.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year to EUR2,013.1 million in the 2014 fiscal year, in 
each case after giving effect to the Company's fuel hedging activities. The 6.8% increase reflected a 3.0% increase 
in average fuel prices paid and the impact of a 7.6% increase in the number of hours flown, which were offset in 
part by a lower fuel burn across the fleet. Fuel and oil costs include the direct cost of fuel, the cost of delivering fuel 
to the aircraft, aircraft de-icing and EU emissions trading costs. The average fuel price paid by Ryanair (calculated 
by dividing total fuel costs by the number of U.S. gallons of fuel consumed) increased 3.0% from EUR2.38 per U.S. 
gallon in the 2013 fiscal year to EUR2.45 per U.S. gallon in the 2014 fiscal year, in each case after giving effect to 
the Company's fuel hedging activities.
 Airport and handling charges and route charges. Ryanair's airport and handling charges per passenger decreased 
2.1% in the 2014 fiscal year, while route charges per passenger increased 4.1%. In absolute terms, airport and 
handling charges increased 0.9%, from EUR611.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year to EUR617.2 million in the 2014 
fiscal year, reflecting the overall growth in passenger volumes, increased charges in Spain, and a quadrupling of 
ATC charges in Italy during the summer, partially offset by the mix of new route and bases launched and the 
weakening of U.K. pound sterling against the euro. In absolute terms, route charges increased 7.3%, from 
EUR486.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, to EUR522.0 million in the 2014 fiscal year, primarily as a result of the 2% 
increase in sectors flown.
 Staff costs. Ryanair's staff costs, which consist primarily of salaries, wages and benefits, increased 3.3% on a per-
passenger basis, while in absolute terms, these costs increased 6.4%, from EUR435.6 million in the 2013 fiscal 
year to EUR463.6 million in the 2014 fiscal year. The increase in absolute terms was primarily attributable to a 7.6% 
increase in hours flown and a pay increase of 2.0% granted in fiscal 2014, partially offset by the weakening of U.K. 
pound sterling against the euro.
 Depreciation. Ryanair's depreciation per passenger increased by 3.6%, while in absolute terms these costs 
increased 6.7% from EUR329.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year to EUR351.8 million in the 2014 fiscal year. The 
increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the average number of owned aircraft in the fleet in the 2014 
fiscal year (246) compared to the 2013 fiscal year (242) and spare engines purchased during the year.  See "-
Critical Accounting Policies-Long-lived Assets" above.
 Marketing, distribution and other expenses. Ryanair's marketing, distribution and other operating expenses, 
including those applicable to the generation of ancillary revenues, decreased 5.5% on a per-passenger basis in the 
2014 fiscal year, while in absolute terms, these costs decreased 2.6%, from EUR197.9 million in the 2013 fiscal 
year to EUR192.8 million in the 2014 fiscal year, with the overall decrease primarily reflecting the reduced 
marketing spend per passenger and lower ancillary revenue costs.
 Maintenance, materials and repairs. Ryanair's maintenance, materials and repair expenses, which consist primarily 
of the cost of routine maintenance, provision for leased aircraft and the overhaul of spare parts, decreased 6.7% on 
a per-passenger basis, while in absolute terms these expenses decreased by 3.8% from EUR120.7 million in the 
2013 fiscal year to EUR116.1 million in the 2014 fiscal year. The decrease in absolute terms during the fiscal year 
reflected improved terms on lease extensions, offset in part by costs arising from the increased level of activity.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -39-
 Aircraft rentals. Aircraft rental expenses amounted to EUR101.5 million in the 2014 fiscal year, a 3.4% increase 
from the EUR98.2 million reported in the 2013 fiscal year, reflecting the negative impact of higher lessor financing 
costs and the adverse impact of changes in the euro/dollar exchange rate.
 Operating profit.  As a result of the factors outlined above, operating profit decreased 11.0% on a per-passenger 
basis in the 2014 fiscal year, and also decreased in absolute terms, from EUR718.2 million in the 2013 fiscal year to 
EUR658.6 million in the 2014 fiscal year.
 Finance expense. Ryanair's interest and similar charges decreased 16.2%, from EUR99.3 million in the 2013 fiscal 
year to EUR83.2 million in the 2014 fiscal year, primarily due to lower interest rates and reduced level of debt in the 
2014 fiscal year compared to the 2013 fiscal year. These costs are expected to increase in future periods as 
Ryanair further expands its fleet.
 Finance income. Ryanair's interest and similar income decreased 39.8%, from EUR27.4 million in the 2013 fiscal 
year to EUR16.5 million in the 2014 fiscal year, reflecting lower interest rates and gross cash balances, partially 
offset by increased dividend income from Aer Lingus shares received in the 2014 fiscal year.
 Foreign exchange gains/losses. Ryanair recorded foreign exchange losses of EUR0.5 million in the 2014 fiscal 
year, as compared with foreign exchange gains of EUR4.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, with the different result 
being primarily due to the negative impact of changes in the euro exchange rate against the U.K. pound sterling.
 Taxation. The effective tax rate for the 2014 fiscal year was 11.6%, as compared to an effective tax rate of 12.5% 
in the 2013 fiscal year. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory rate of Irish corporation tax of 12.5%. Ryanair 
recorded an income tax provision of EUR68.6 million in the 2014 fiscal year, compared with a tax provision of 
EUR81.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, with the decrease primarily reflecting lower pre-tax profits. The 
determination regarding the recoverability of the deferred tax asset was based on future income forecasts, which 
demonstrated that it was more likely than not that future profits would be available in order to utilize the deferred tax 
asset. A deferred tax asset's recoverability is not dependent on material improvements over historical levels of pre-
tax income, material changes in the present relationship between income reported for financial and tax purposes, or 
material asset sales or other non-routine transactions.

 CSO confirms slump in visitors since Irish Govt EUR10 tourist tax introduced
 Ryanair calls on Govt to axe the EUR10 tourist tax
Ryanair, the World's favourite airline, today (15th Oct 09) welcomed the CSO
 traffic figures which confirm that 123,000 (13%) fewer visitors travelled to
 Ireland in August as the Govt's EUR10 tourist tax devastates Irish tourism, even
 during the summer peak. Ryanair's August traffic grew by 19%, over 1.1m new
 passengers, which disproves the Govt's false claim that this decline is due to
 the recession.

Ryanair warned that unless the Irish Government's EUR10 tourist tax is scrapped,
Ryanair Holdings PLC Tourist Tax - CSO Confirms Drop in Figures
 then the fall in Irish visitor numbers will worsen during winter, as more
 flights, routes and services are cut from the Government's high cost Dublin,
 Cork and Shannon Airports.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
"CSO figures show a 13% drop in visitor numbers in August and 11% for the year
 to date. The loss of 600,000 visitors so far this year confirms that the
 collapse in Irish tourism is accelerating as the EUR10 tourist tax makes Ireland
 an uncompetitive tourist destination.
"In recent months the Belgian, Dutch, Greek and Spanish governments have all
 scrapped tourist taxes and/or reduced airport charges, in some cases to zero, in
 order to stimulate tourism. Ryanair has expanded in these countries including
 our recent announcement of 43 new routes to/from Spain this winter.  The Irish
 Government cannot grow Irish tourism by taxing it.  We must axe this stupid EUR10
 tourist tax and start welcoming visitors, not taxing them".

                        RYANAIR RESPONDS TO LEGAL ACTION
                   FROM PRESIDENT SARKOZY AND MS CARLA BRUNI
Ryanair, France's largest low fares airline today (Thursday, 31 January 2008)
responded to a legal action launched by President Sarkozy and Ms Carla Bruni,
relating to a humorous advert, which ran in the Le Parisien newspaper last week.
Ryanair has previously written to President Sarkozy's office apologising for any
offence caused, and undertaking that it would not publish the advert (or
anything similar to it) again. Ryanair has also offered - as a token of its
regret - to make a donation of EUR5,000 to any charity of President Sarkozy's
choice.
Last evening however, Ryanair received legal papers from President Sarkozy and
Ms Bruni under which President Sarkozy was seeking damages of EUR1, but Ms Bruni
was seeking damages of EUR500,000. Ryanair's lawyers will today tell the French
Ryanair Holdings PLC SARKOZY LEGAL ACTION
Courts that they are happy to settle President Sarkozy's claim for EUR1 and
Ryanair will renew its offer to make a charitable contribution of EUR5,000 to any
charity of President Sarkozy's choice. Ryanair has the utmost respect for
President Sarkozy and the high office which he holds.
Ryanair's lawyers will also make a similar offer to Ms Bruni, offering damages
of EUR1 and a contribution of EUR5,000 to any charity of Mr Bruni's choice. Ryanair
will not however agree to any totally unjustified payment of EUR500,000 to Ms
Bruni, who has engaged in an open, widely publicised and internationally
reported relationship with President Sarkozy. The advert used by Ryanair was
taken from one of the French newspapers and Ryanair notes that Ms Bruni did not
make any objection to any of the remaining thousands of photographs of her which
have appeared in over 55,000 newspapers and magazines in recent weeks.
Speaking today Ryanair's Peter Sherrard said:
        "We apologised immediately and sincerely to both President Sarkozy and
         Ms Bruni for this advert which ran in Le Parisien newspaper this week.
         It was an honest attempt by Ryanair to reflect humorously and positively
         on this very public and publicised relationship.
        "However Ryanair has no intention of giving in to threats from Ms Bruni
         or to her ludicrous claims and we will vigorously oppose any claim for
         EUR500,000 from this lady who had engaged in one of the most open,
         publicised and internationally reported relationships, in the world, in
         recent weeks.
        "We do however renew our sincere apologies to both President Sarkozy and
         to Ms Bruni and believe that an appropriate payment to a charity of
         their choice would be the best and most elegant way to resolve this
         matter".

 RYANAIR CALLS FOR THE BREAK UP OF THE DAA MONOPOLY AND THE DEPT OF TRANSPORT AS DUBLIN  AIRPORT FAILS EU 
SECURITY STANDARDS
 THE DAA UNDER DOT CONTROL & PROTECTION SIMPLY ISN'T FIT FOR PURPOSE
 Ryanair, Ireland's largest airline, today (15 May) called on Transport Minister
 Leo Varadkar to break-up the DAA monopoly and free it from the dead hand of the Dept of Transport (DOT) 
protection after Dublin airport failed to meet EU security standards, which means that all aircraft and 
passengers departing from Dublin airport must undergo similar security check at destination airports as if 
they were flying from Middle Eastern or third world countries with known security or terrorism risks.  All 
aircraft and passengers departing from Dublin may now undergo segregation and additional security checks 
upon arrival due to the failure of the DAA and its downtown office the Dept of Transport to comply with 
European security minima.
 This lamentable lack of adequate security at DAA Dublin airport, the five year record traffic declines at 
Dublin, Cork and Shannon, the waste of over EUR1bn wasted on unnecessary (largely empty) new terminals at 
Dublin, Cork and Shannon proves that neither the Dept of Transport or the DAA monopoly which it owns and 
protects are fit for purpose.  The DAA is an international embarrassment to Ireland.
 Ryanair has been vindicated in its long standing criticism of the DAA monopoly and the equally 
unimportant DOT. Ryanair believes the solution to these problems lies in breaking up the DAA and freeing 
it from the dead hand of the DOT by selling Shannon and Cork airports to the highest bidders (and using 
the proceeds to pay down govt debt) as well as selling off terminals 1 and 2 at Dublin to competing 
airport operators at a time when Edinburgh airport (with 9 m pax) was recently sold for almost EUR1bn.  
Competition between airports and terminals will deliver lower costs, traffic growth, improved passenger 
services and effective airport security where the DAA and DOT has patently failed.
 Ryanair also called on the Irish govt to confirm that all airlines and their passengers will be 
compensated directly by the DAA and the DOT for any additional costs or delays that they may suffer as as 
result of these additional (and totally avoidable) security costs on flights from Dublin.
 Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said;
 "As a new Minister Leo Varadkar has promised to deliver 'change and reform', yet today's embarrassing 
security failure means that Irish passengers will once again be treated as second class citizens and/or 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR CALLS FOR THE BREAK UP OF THE DAA MONOPOLY
potential terrorists every time they land at other EU airports.  This is a totally unacceptable and yet 
avoidable failure by the DAA and the DOT.
 Since neither the DAA or the DOT are fit for purpose Minister Varadkar must now deliver real change and 
reform by breaking up the failed DAA monopoly, selling off its airports and terminals as well as overseas 
investments and using the proceeds to pay down some of Ireland's national debt.  At a time of recession 
and rising unemployment Ireland cannot afford the high cost, traffic declines, gold-plated facilities, or 
security mismanagement of the DAA and its equally incompetent down town office the Dept of Transport."

EUROPEAN COURT HEARS RYANAIR'S APPEAL AGAINST COMMISSION'S CHARLEROI DECISION
Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (Wednesday, 12th March 2008)
confirmed that the European Court of First Instance (CFI) had heard its appeal
against the EU Commission's anti competitive decision in the Charleroi case in
2004. The Commission ignored 30 years of Market Economy Investor Principal
precedent cases and changed its own (MEIP) rules in the Charleroi case in order
to find against Ryanair. The Commission failed to apply the accepted MEIP test,
which obliges it to allow state owned companies to compete on a level playing
field with similar privately owned companies.
The Commission ignored all of the evidence provided by Ryanair and industry
experts like Infratil and TBI, which proved that the agreement between Ryanair
and Charleroi Airport was the result of a competitive tender and did not involve
state aid.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Court Hears Charleroi Appeal
Commenting today following the hearing at the CFI, Ryanair's Head of Regulatory
Affairs, Jim Callaghan, said:
"Ryanair is happy to have finally forced the European Commission into court. We
are confident that the CFI will overturn what is a patently wrong and
anti-competitive decision. The case evidence clearly shows that the Commission
went to extreme lengths to invent a finding of state aid in this case and to use
it as a precedent to regulate all publicly owned airports.
At the hearing in Luxembourg, Ryanair raised the following grounds:
   The Commission failed to apply the Market Economy Investor Principle
     (MEIP), which is the test for proving that a public company was acting in
     the same way as a private investor would have in the same circumstances.
   The Commission ignored evidence that the Charleroi agreement resulted
     from Ryanair's negotiations with several other lower cost airports.
   The Commission ignored the fact that Ryanair's cost base at Charleroi was
     specifically offered to other airlines willing to make the same investment
     in the airport that Ryanair did.
   The Commission ignored the fact that Ryanair demonstrated that it had
     lower costs at several other privately owned airports.
   The Commission ignored the huge growth in traffic, profits and value of
     Charleroi airport as a result of Ryanair's investment in the airport
     (roughly EUR200 million).
   The Commission ignored the fact that other airlines, commercial retailers
     and airport investors have come to Brussels Charleroi Airport as a result of
     the successful partnership between Ryanair and the airport.
The Commission's decision was therefore seriously wrong and legally untenable.
We look forward to a positive decision of the CFI and are confident that the
successful partnership between low fares airlines and regional airports will be
vindicated and the anti competitive actions of the European commission
overturned".

 RYANAIR TRADING UPDATE - 4 SEPT 2013
 Ryanair Holdings Plc today (4 Sept) issued a trading update and cautioned that while it remains 
comfortable with its H1 guidance, a recent weakness in forward yields into Q3 suggests that there will be 
no upgrade to full year guidance, as the airline now expects the full year outturn will be at the lower 
end of its full year net profit range of EUR570m to EUR600m.  However if fares and yields continue to 
weaken over the coming winter there can be no guarantee that the full year outturn may not finish at or 
slightly below the lower end of this range.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "As indicated during our Q1 results presentation on July 29, close in late bookings in July had been at 
weaker than expected yields due primarily to the heatwave in Northern Europe and weaker sterling/euro 
exchange rates. The close in booking pattern returned to some normality in August, which will ensure that 
our H1 guidance remains unchanged, which is for a small increase in H1 profits over the prior year H1 
comparable.
 However in recent weeks we have noticed a perceptible dip in forward fares and yields into September, 
October and November, which is we believe due to a combination of factors:
 --    Increased price competition and some capacity increases in the UK, Scandinavia, Spanish and Irish 
markets.
 --    The continuing effect of austerity and weak economic conditions across Europe.
 --    Weaker sterling/euro exchange rates.
 We will respond to this lower yield outlook by selectively reducing our winter season capacity, thereby 
cutting our full year traffic target from over 81.5m to just under 81m.  We are also rolling out a range 
of lower fares and aggressive seat sales particularly in those markets mainly UK, Scandinavia, Spain and 
Ireland.
 Ryanair remains confident that we will continue to hit our revised passenger targets albeit at lower 
fares and yields than originally expected.  Accordingly it is prudent to advise shareholders that our full 
year profit after tax (PAT) guidance will now be at the lower end of our EUR570m to EUR600m range.
 However even at or slightly below this full year number of EUR570m PAT, Ryanair cash flows and balance 
sheet remain in rude good health and there is no change to our recently announced plans to complete share 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Trading Statement
buybacks of at least EUR400m (EUR177m already completed in FY March 2014) and up to EUR600m via a 
combination of dividends and/or buybacks in FY March 2015."
 An analyst conference call will be held at 9.00am.
 The dial in number is 00 44 203-427-1909 and conference call code 2628709.

Welcoming today's decision, Peter Sherrard of Ryanair said:
        "In the light of the extraordinary worldwide publicity generated by this
         single advert, we have instructed our lawyers to write to President
         Sarkozy's office, offering to make a similar EUR60,000 payment to any
         French charity of President Sarkozy's choice.
        "Ryanair had already confirmed that this advert will not run again. Now
         that this matter has been settled satisfactorily, we look forward to
         continuing to grow Ryanair's low fare services in France where today
         Ryanair serves 23 French airports, carrying 6 million tourists each year

                                  IN UK & EUROPE
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Wednesday, 10th November 2004)
celebrated carrying nearly half a million MORE passengers than BA in UK/Europe
during October. Passenger traffic statistics released by Ryanair and BA
confirmed Ryanair carried 2,462 M passengers in October 2004 - 443,000 MORE than
BA in UK/Europe.
Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
        "Each month more and more people are choosing Ryanair in Europe over BA,
         because only Ryanair offers Europe's lowest air fares coupled with No.1
         punctuality, frequency and customer service.
        "Since May BA has added not one, not two but THREE fuel surcharges to
         their already ludicrously expensive fares and the public are voting with
         their feet. Now we have nearly half a million extra confirmations that
         Ryanair is Britain's favourite airline in UK & Europe!"

 RYANAIR REPORTS H1 PROFITS UP 1% TO EUR602M,
 TRAFFIC AND LOAD FACTORS RISE ON LOWER FARES
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline today (Nov 4) reported that H1 profits rose by 1% to EUR602m, as its 
traffic grew 2% to 49m passengers.  Revenue per passenger increased 2% due to a 22% rise in ancillary revenues.  
Unit costs rose 3% largely due to a 7% increase in fuel prices.  Average fares fell by 2% during the half year, and 
have continued to fall this winter, which will lead to a reduction in Ryanair's full year profit guidance from EUR570m 
to approx. EUR510m.
H1 Results (IFRS)       Sept 30, 2012    Sept 30, 2013    % Change

"Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
 We are pleased to report slightly increased H1 profits, particularly against a backdrop of softer fares 
this summer.  Yields in Q3 have softened, which is good news for our customers and has led to strong 
growth in traffic (up 6% in Oct) and load factors (up 1%).  The highlights of the half year include:-
 --    Record H1 profit of EUR602m, in line with previous guidance.
 --    Traffic up 2% to 49m (load factor up 1% to 85%).
 --    Seven new bases and 116 new routes opened
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report
 --    175 new aircraft order agreed with Boeing.
 --    New 10 year growth deals at London (STN) and Warsaw (MOD) airports.
 --    Irish travel tax EUR3 scrapped from April 2014.
 --    EUR177m share buyback completed, H1 cash of EUR3.5bn.
 The 2% fall in fares during H1 was impacted by one off events such as the timing of Easter (not in Q1), 
the summer heatwave in northern Europe, French ATC strikes in June, and weaker sterling.  Ryanair has 
responded to these market conditions by stimulating traffic growth with aggressive fare promotions.  This 
will lay the foundation for traffic growth over the coming years, particularly as our new 175 aircraft 
deliver from September 2014.  While fares are falling, ancillary revenues grew strongly by 22% to EUR713m, 
driven by the successful roll out of reserved seating, priority boarding and higher credit/debit card 
fees.
 Unit costs in H1 rose 3% mainly due to a 7% increase in fuel costs.  Excluding fuel, sector length 
adjusted unit costs fell by 2% as we continued to deliver cost efficiencies, despite higher Eurocontrol 
charges and the impact of a 2% pay increase from April last.
 1.  Growth - New Routes and Bases
 Our new routes and bases performed well this summer, albeit at weaker yields.  With only 9 (net) 
additional aircraft, we still managed to grow our H1 traffic by 2%, thanks to a load factor increase of 
1%.  High cost competitor airlines are continuing to cut capacity in major markets such as France, 
Germany, Poland, Spain and Italy and this continues to create growth opportunities for Ryanair.  With our 
175 new aircraft order, our new 10 year growth deals at London (STN) and Warsaw (MOD) airports, and the 
Irish Govt's recent decision to scrap the EUR3 travel tax from April 2014, Ryanair is well positioned to 
return to strong and profitable traffic growth from September 2014 onwards.
 2.  Digital Marketing and Customer Service
 After 20 consecutive years of rapid growth, the next 12 months will see a brief pause in traffic growth, 
along with stable load factors.  We intend to use this period to further improve our industry leading 
customer service.  Over recent weeks we have announced a series of customer service initiatives including 
scrapping the Recaptcha security feature, allowing a small second carry-on bag, "quiet flights" before 8am 
and after 9pm, a 24 hour "grace period" to allow passengers correct minor booking errors, and 
significantly reduced boarding card reissue and standard bag fees.  These customer service initiatives 
have been widely welcomed and generated very positive feedback from our growing customer base.
 We have also announced a programme of significant upgrades to our website and digital platforms including 
a simpler website homepage, an improved booking path reducing (from 17 to 5) the clicks required to make a 
booking, and a new "My Ryanair" member service which allows customers to register their name, address and 
credit card details just once.   Early next year we will roll out mobile boarding passes, a "Share the 
Fare" option, a "Fare Finder" feature which will enable our customers to find dates and flights where 
these lowest fares are available, a new mobile app for smartphones and tablets, and in June 2014 new 
bespoke language websites in all Ryanair's major EU markets starting with Spain and Italy.
 3.  Allocated Seating
 Ryanair is pleased to announce in today's results that it will from 1 Feb 2014 move to fully allocated 
seating on all Ryanair flights, making the boarding process smoother, and enabling families or other 
groups to ensure that they sit together.  Passengers will still be able to choose our popular reserved 
seating service (select front row or over-wing seats), or alternatively select seats elsewhere on the 
aircraft, as long as they check-in more than 24 hours prior to the date of departure.  All passengers who 
don't wish to pay a small fee (EUR5) to select their preferred seats will be allocated seats during the 24 
hours prior to the date of scheduled departure.  This return to allocated seating is Ryanair's response to 
the enormous demand from our customers in recent weeks via Ryanair's "Tell MOL" customer feedback 
initiative.  Ryanair's decision to launch fully allocated seating is also part of the airline's commitment 
to listen to its customers, and improve its industry leading customer service which comprises Europe's 
lowest air fares, most on-time flights,  fewest lost bags, and fewest customer complaints.
 4.  Fuel
 Ryanair remains 90% hedged for FY'14 at $980 per tonne (approx. $98 p.bl).  We have taken advantage of 
recent weakness in oil prices and the US dollar to extend our FY15 hedges to 60% at approx. $94 p.bl. 
which at current market rates should deliver a unit cost fuel reduction of approx. 4% in FY15.
 5.  Balance Sheet
 Ryanair's balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry.  Our fleet has been purchased at 
substantial discounts, which is a significant long term benefit for shareholders.  Despite EUR177m of 
share buybacks during H1 (and a further EUR75m in Oct), gross cash at the end of Sept was over EUR3.5bn.  
We plan to execute at least EUR150m of further share buybacks before the end of FY14.  In addition the 
airline's commitment to return up to EUR600m to shareholders via share buybacks and special dividend 
before the end of FY15 remains unchanged.  This will bring to over EUR2.4bn the amount of funds returned 
to shareholders since FY08.
 6.  Trading Update and Guidance Outlook
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report
 On September 4, Ryanair announced that it had noticed a perceptible dip in forward fares and yields into 
Q3 due to, (i) increased price competition, (ii) softer economic conditions in Europe and, (iii) the 
weaker Euro/Sterling exchange rate.  We responded to this yield softness by lowering our FY14 traffic 
target from over 81.5m to just under 81m.  We also released a range of lower fares and aggressive seat 
sales to stimulate traffic, load factors and bookings across all markets.  The success of this strategy 
has been vindicated by our 6% rise in October traffic, and a 1% increase in load factors.
 Market pricing remains weak, so we will continue to promote low fare seat sales throughout the remainder 
of both Q3 and Q4.  Forward bookings are running slightly ahead of last year, but the softness in fares 
and yields continues.  Based on reasonable visibility we expect Q3 fares to fall by 9%, and Q4 (albeit 
with zero visibility) to fall by up to 10% (without the benefit of Easter which will be in Q1 FY15).  Our 
cost discipline will see sector length adjusted cost per passenger fall by 7% in H2.  However the 
continuing fare and yield softness means that full year profits will be lower than previously guided 
(EUR570m to EUR600m).  We now expect the full year outturn to be between EUR500m to EUR520m due entirely 
to this lower fare environment.

All of Ryanair's 4,800 people wish to extend their sincere and deepest
sympathies to the family and many friends of DR TONY RYAN who died this
afternoon, after a long illness.
Dr Ryan founded Ryanair 23 years ago. He persevered when all others lost faith.
His vision, leadership and ambition inspired Ryanair's growth to become the
world's biggest international passenger airline. He was, and will remain, an
inspiration to all of us.
It is rare that one man in his own lifetime can transform the lives of millions.
Dr Ryan did so by pioneering competition and low fare air travel in Europe.
Ryanair is proud to bear his name and his legacy. We will miss him greatly.
Dr Ryan and the Ryan family are in our thoughts and prayers at this time.
Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR MOURNS DR TONY RYAN
    "Tony Ryan was one of the greatest Irishmen of the 20th Century. His many
     achievements in business, education, sport, the arts and heritage
     preservation leave an astonishing legacy to an extraordinary man. He was
     immensely supportive of, and took great pride in his family and their many
     successes. It was a privilege to work for him and to learn from him. I will
     miss his guidance, encouragement and friendship. We are all determined that
     Ryanair will continue to carry his name with pride and distinction".
Ryanair's Chairman, David Bonderman said:
    "It has been a pleasure and a privilege both to know and work with Tony
     Ryan. He possessed an extraordinary vision. Whether it was airline
     investments in Asia, vineyards in Europe or bloodstock in the U.S., he
     brought a tremendous sense of style, charm and good humour to all of his
     business and personal relationships. Ireland will be a poorer place for the
     loss of Tony Ryan".

 RYANAIR WELCOMES EU CONFIRMATION THAT NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS MUST COMPENSATE
 AIRLINES FOR EU AIRSPACE CLOSURE
Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, welcomed today's (27 April 10) confirmation
 by EU Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas that National Governments would have to
 compensate airlines for the losses suffered following the unnecessary and
 inappropriate closure of European airspace by those EU Governments over the past
 week.
Ryanair confirmed that it has written to the Irish Dept. of Transport expressing
 its opposition to any State Aid for airlines, but proposing four simple and
 effective relief measures, which are within the power of the Dept of Transport
 and the Irish Government to initiate as follows:
1.   Ryanair has called for the 40% price increases currently planned by the
 Govt owned DAA airports from 1 May to be deferred for a minimum period of 12
 months.
2.   Ryanair has called for the Irish Govt's EUR10 tourist tax to be scrapped from
 1 May.
3.   Ryanair has called for the Dept of Transport to direct the Aviation
 Regulator to reject any follow on claims for price increases by regulated
 monopolies (DAA and  IAA) seeking further price increases to compensate them for
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Response to EU Report on Volcanic Ash
 the loss of revenue during last weeks closure of Irish airspace.
4.   Ryanair has called on the Irish Govt to lead the reform of the EU261
 legislation to limit passenger rights to the amount of the air fare paid (as is
 the case for European train, ferry and coach operators) and also to limit the
 liability of airlines in cases where the problem is not within the control of
 the airlines (such as last week's Government closure of EU airspace).
Ryanair and the other Irish airlines (who have written in similar terms to the
 Dept of Transport) are waiting for a positive response from the Minister and the
 Dept.  Ryanair today confirmed that it would in time be seeking a full recovery
 from the Irish Government of all refunds to passengers, both of air fares and
 any reasonable receipted expenses, during the recent unnecessary 7 day closure
 of EU airspace by EU Governments.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said today:
"We welcome Commissioner Kallas' confirmation that EU Governments must
 compensate their airlines for the losses suffered last week through the
 unnecessary closure of EU airspace, which was not the fault of airlines.  The
 Irish Government could go a long way towards meeting these costs by implementing
 the four simple relief measures already proposed by the main  Irish airlines.
 The Irish airlines, operating as we do from an island country, were more
 severely impacted by last week's events, since passengers could not transfer to
 alternative ground transportation in order to complete their journeys.  These
 EU261 regulations weren't designed for catastrophic, prolonged closures of
 European airspace.  When even travel insurers are not obliged to pay out
 (because the cause of this was an Act of God), it is clearly unfair that
 Europe's airlines are expected to be the insurer of last resort, when the
 responsibility for passenger costs and expenses should lie with the EU's
 Governments, who were the parties that closed European airspace, not the
 airlines".

                   RYANAIR WELCOMES ITALIAN COURT'S DECISION
                          TO PUT PEOPLE BEFORE PARCELS
Ryanair, Italy's second largest airline today (Friday, 10th February 2006)
welcomed the decision of the TAR Lazio court to grant an injunction to Ryanair
that will prevent Italian passengers and visitors to Rome from being diverted to
Rome Fiumicino while flights continue to land in Rome Ciampino.
Since the beginning of January, 7 Ryanair flights (on Ciampino based aircraft)
returning shortly after midnight were diverted to Fiumicino. These diversions
forced over 1,000 Italian consumers and visitors to land in Fiumicino, when
their friends and relatives and their onward transport was awaiting them in
Ciampino. A further 1,000 passengers had their flights the following morning
delayed as aircraft were positioned from Fiumicino to Ciampino.
Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Welcome Italian Court
        "We welcome the decision of the TAR to put people before parcels by
         allowing passengers on Ryanair based aircraft to land in Rome Ciampino.
        "Ryanair is committed to using its new quieter aircraft to minimise
         noise generation at Rome Ciampino. We are now talking to ADR about a
         noise reduction programme for the benefit of the local community.
        "Today we have again written to ENAC requesting a meeting to resolve
         this issue and to ensure no more Italian citizens or visitors are
         diverted unnecessarily to Fiumicino on planes that are based in
         Ciampino, while their friends and relatives are waiting for them in
         Ciampino".
Note to Editors:
Since Jan 2004, 5 Ryanair aircraft have been based permanently in Ciampino.
These have generated 160 direct Ryanair jobs in Ciampino. More than 3000 jobs
have been created thanks to the 3M passengers that Ryanair delivers annually in
Rome Ciampino. Ryanair's low fares have made Rome, Europe's fastest growing city
break destination.

                 BA'S FARES TO FRANCE & ITALY SIX TIMES HIGHER
                                  THAN RYANAIR'S
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Friday, 21st May 2004)
criticised BA's latest attempt to rip-off consumers with high fares to France
and Italy - fares that are an incredible SIX times more expensive than
Ryanair's.
Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
        "BA's latest 'offer' is a joke! They are continuing to price gouge
         consumers with their ridiculously high fares. The public already knows
         BA's fares are a rip-off. BA can't match Ryanair's low fares and can't
         match Ryanair's punctuality record and customer service.
        "BA's latest offering to the South of France start at a wallet busting
         GBP179.00, almost SIX TIMES HIGHER than Ryanair's low fare to South
         France, from GBP30 return! BA's fares to Italy - from GBP189 - are MORE THAN
         SIX TIMES HIGHER than Ryanair's from just GBP30 return.
        "This year Ryanair will carry 28 million passengers on 151 routes across
         16 European countries. It's no wonder millions of consumers are voting
         with their feet and choosing Ryanair's unbeatable value to South of

26 February 2008
                    Ryanair Update on Web System Changeover
Ryanair, today (Tuesday, 26th February 2008) continued to make significant
progress on eliminating many of the software glitches involved in bedding down
its new 'New Skies' reservations system, which is the background booking engine
of www.ryanair.com. This process has given rise to some hours today when record
bookings of over 20,000 per hour were taken, but also some hours when the
internet access on www.ryanair.com was temporarily reduced resulting in less
than 5,000 bookings being made.
Ryanair and its software supplier are continuing to work intensively to
eliminate these bedding down issues, and we expect to continue to deliver
improved internet access and faster booking speeds this evening and tomorrow.
The principal difficulty the website is encountering is the enormous surge of
passengers a) who were unable to make bookings over the weekend and b) who are
Ryanair Holdings PLC Update on Web Site
keen to get one of Ryanair's 1 million x 1 penny (tax inclusive) seats, which
are available for travel on Tuesdays and Wednesdays in April, May and June.
Ryanair apologises to any passengers who have suffered inconvenience in
attempting to access Ryanair.com over the last 24 hours, but wishes to assure
all passengers that once this cut-over process has been completed this week,
they can look forward to faster booking times, and Europe's guaranteed lowest
airfares on www.ryanair.com.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Peter Sherrard said:
        "We are continuing to make significant progress with the cut over to the
         New Skies system. However, we expect further bedding down problems over
         the next day or two and we ask all passengers to be patient with us, as
         we complete the largest ever software changeover undertaken by any
         airline, anywhere in the world."

 July 25, 2014
 Independent Auditor's Report to the members of Ryanair Holdings plc
 Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
 Opinion on financial statements
 1    Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
 We have audited the consolidated and Company financial statements ("financial statements") of Ryanair 
Holdings plc for the year ended March 31, 2014, which comprise the consolidated and Company balance 
sheets, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated and Company statements of changes in shareholders' equity, the consolidated and Company 
statements of cash flows and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is Irish law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union (EU), and, as regards the parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2013. Our audit was conducted in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) (UK and Ireland).
 In our opinion:
 --   the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU, of the state of the Group's affairs as at 31 March 2014 and of its profit for the year then ended;
 --   the Company balance sheet gives a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Acts 1963 to 2013, of the state of the 
Company's affairs as at 31 March 2014; and
 --   the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Acts 1963 to 
2013 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
 Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
 As explained in Note 1 on page 152 of the consolidated financial statements, the Group, in addition to 
complying with its legal obligation to comply with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, has also prepared its 
consolidated financial statements in compliance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
 In our opinion:
 --   the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as issued 
by the IASB, of the state of the Group's affairs as at March 31, 2014 and of its profit for the year then 
ended.
 2    Our assessment of the risks of material misstatement
 The risks of material misstatement detailed in this section of this report are those risks that we have 
deemed, in our professional judgement, to have had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in our audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. Our audit 
procedures relating to these risks were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements 
as a whole. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of these risks, 
and we do not express an opinion on these individual risks.
 In arriving at our audit opinion above on the Group financial statements the risks of material 
misstatement that had the greatest effect on our Group audit were as follows:
 Carrying value of Property, Plant & Equipment
 Ryanair has property, plant and equipment with a carrying value of EUR5,060.3 million at 31 March 2014 
(2013 EUR4,906.3 million) including aircraft (including engines and related equipment) with a carrying 
value of EUR5,001.1 million (2013 EUR4,854.5 million). In accounting for these assets, Ryanair makes 
estimates about their expected useful lives, expected residual values and the potential for impairment 
based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. Changes to the expected useful 
lives and/or the residual values of Ryanair's aircraft fleet could have a material impact on the profit 
for the year. This risk is described in the report from the Audit Committee on page 21.  Ryanair flies one 
aircraft type, the Boeing 737-800, all of which are aged between one and 12 years. There is an active and 
established market for this asset class. The procedures we performed to assess the carrying value of the 
aircraft included:
 --  Comparing Ryanair's estimates of expected useful life and residual value to manufacturers' 
recommendations and to the published estimates of other international airlines.
 --  Assessing the allocation of purchase price to the various components of the aircraft to ensure that 
the value allocated to its service potential compares with actual experience.
 Independent Auditor's Report to the members of Ryanair Holdings plc (continued)
 Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit (continued)
 2              Our assessment of the risks of material misstatement (continued)
 Carrying value of Property, Plant & Equipment (continued)
 --  Agreeing the fair value of this aircraft type to generally available independent third party 
valuation reports prepared by specialist aircraft valuation experts to assess the accuracy of the residual 
value estimate.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -11-
 --  Challenging the key assumptions underpinning Ryanair's near and medium term financial projections 
against historical performance and estimates of the likely economic conditions in its principal markets.
 Maintenance expense
 Ryanair had 51 aircraft held under operating lease at 31 March 2014 (2013: 59 aircraft).  Under the terms 
of operating lease agreements with aircraft lessors, Ryanair is contractually committed to either return 
the aircraft in a certain condition or to compensate the lessor based on the actual condition of the 
airframe, engines and life limited parts upon return.  During the year ended 31 March 2014, Ryanair 
recorded maintenance expense of EUR116.1 million (2013: EUR120.7 million) and carried provisions for 
future maintenance at 31 March 2014 of EUR132.2 million (2013: EUR122.4 million).  The estimated airframe 
and engine maintenance costs and the costs associated with the restitution of life limited parts are 
accrued and charged to profit and loss over the lease term for the individual contractual obligation, 
based on the present value of the major airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks and restitution of 
life limited parts by reference to the number of hours flown or cycles operated during the year. This risk 
is further highlighted in the report from the Audit Committee on page 21.
 Our audit procedures in this area involved testing the key assumptions made by Ryanair in estimating 
future maintenance costs including anticipated use of the aircraft and the expected cost of maintenance.  
The procedures included agreeing the actual cost of incurred maintenance to invoices and comparing this 
with Ryanair's estimates, agreeing estimated maintenance costs to maintenance contracts and agreeing the 
expected use of assets to aircraft utilisation in the prior periods and to Ryanair's scheduling plan.

Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Wednesday, 19th December
2007) celebrated a record 2 million passengers this Christmas and New Year,
uniting friends and families across 26 countries on 605 routes. This is a 20%
increase on last year's holiday traffic and means that Ryanair will carry more
international passengers than any other airline in the world this Christmas.
Speaking today, Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications said:
        "Ryanair will operate more flights than Rudolph this Christmas.
         Passengers have made Ryanair the world's favourite airline this Festive
         Season because only we guarantee the lowest fares, the best punctuality
         and no fuel surcharges ever. Christmas is one of the busiest times of
         the year and we urge all passengers to arrive early at the airport and
         those who have not already booked to do so today on www.ryanair.com."
Ends.                             Wednesday, 19th December 2007

 Having returned over EUR2.5bn to our shareholders over the past 7 years, Ryanair will continue to look for 
opportunities to reward our shareholders for their investment in, and support for, our airline.
 I would like to sincerely thank all the team at Ryanair for their hard work and dedication over the past 12 months.  I 
would especially like to thank our Chairman, David Bonderman, who continues to provide strategic guidance and 
wise counsel.  We are extremely fortunate to have someone of David's stature and experience in the business and 
despite his somewhat dodgy dress sense and musical taste I hope he will continue to chair Ryanair for many years 
to come.
 Finally, may I close by thanking all of Ryanair's 82m customers who have flown with us over the last 12 months. 
We value your business and we are honoured that you chose to fly with Ryanair.  I hope we will continue to 
welcome you and your families on board many more Ryanair flights in the future.
 Yours sincerely,
 Michael O'Leary

Summary year ended March 31, 2014
 Profit after tax decreased by 8% to EUR522.8 million compared to EUR569.3 million in the year ended March 31, 
2013 primarily due to a 5% increase in total operating expenses and a 4% reduction in average fares, offset by 
strong ancillary revenues and increased traffic. Total operating revenues increased by 3% to EUR5,036.7 million, 
primarily due to the 17% growth in ancillary revenues to EUR1,247.2 million and a 3% rise in traffic,  offset by a 4% 
reduction in average fares.
 Total revenue per passenger, as a result, remained flat. Load Factor increased by 1% to 83% compared to the 
year ended March 31, 2013.
 Total operating expenses increased by 5% to EUR4,378.1 million, due to increased fuel prices and the  higher level 
of activity.  Fuel, which represents 46% of total operating costs compared to 45% in the prior year, increased by 7% 
to EUR2,013.1 million due to the higher euro price per gallon paid and increased activity in the year.  Unit costs 
excluding fuel increased by 1% (sector length adjusted unit costs fell by 3%) and including fuel they rose by 2%.  
Operating margin decreased by 2% to 13% whilst operating profit decreased by 8% to EUR658.6 million.

RYANAIR'S JULY TRAFFIC GROWS 19%
LOWEST FARES AIRTRAVEL GROWING RAPIDLY
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fare airlines today (Tuesday, 5th August 2008)
announced that it carried 5.66 million passengers in July, a 19% (900,000
passenger) increase when compared to July 2007.
Ryanair is confident that traffic growth will remain strong as Ryanair continues
to offer passengers the guaranteed lowest airfares and no fuel surcharges this
winter. These strong growth figures prove that low fares travel is growing
rapidly as competitors raise their high fares and fuel surcharges.
Stephen McNamara, Head of Communications, said:
"Ryanair's latest passenger figures show that we are rapidly growing
passenger numbers this year. The most significant thing about today's figures is
that we carried over 15million passengers in the last three months. Passengers
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 's July Traffic Grows 19% (Replacement)
are increasingly attracted to Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares and our promise
of no fuel surcharges ever".

 LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN TO THE SHAREHOLDERS
 OF RYANAIR HOLDINGS PLC
 Dear Shareholder,
 I am pleased to inform you that the Annual Report and Financial Statements for Ryanair Holdings plc for 
the year ended March 31, 2015, are now available on our website www.ryanair.com. You will find the Notice 
of the Annual General Meeting set out on pages 4 to 7 of this document. The Annual General Meeting will be 
held on September 24, 2015 at 9.00 a.m. in the Radisson Blu Hotel, Dublin Airport, Co. Dublin, Ireland.
 Action to be taken
 Proxy Form
 You will find enclosed a Form of Proxy and Attendance Card for the Annual General Meeting.  Whether or 
not you wish to attend the Annual General Meeting you should complete and sign the Form of Proxy and 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Notice of AGM
return it by no later than 9.00 a.m. on September 22, 2015 to Capita Asset Services, Shareholder solutions 
(Ireland), P.O. Box 7117, Dublin 2, Ireland (Please see notes 4 and 5 attached). Completion and return of 
the Form of Proxy will not preclude you from attending and voting at the Annual General Meeting, should

Card with you. If you appoint a person other than the Chairman or any other officer of Ryanair Holdings 
plc as your proxy, please give your Attendance Card to that person for his/her admission to the Meeting.
 Business to be considered at the Annual General Meeting
 Your attention is drawn to the Notice of Meeting on pages 4 to 7, which sets out matters to be considered 
at the Annual General Meeting. The ordinary business to be transacted at the Annual General Meeting is set 
out in resolutions 1 to 4 in the Notice.
 Under Resolution 1, shareholders are being asked to receive and consider the accounts for the year ended 
March 31, 2015 and the reports of the Directors and Auditors thereon.
 Under Resolution 2, shareholders are being asked to consider the Remuneration Report contained in 
Ryanair's Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2015. This advisory and non-binding resolution is 
often referred to as a "say on pay" resolution. While it is not mandatory for companies to put such a 
resolution to shareholders, it is best practice and Ryanair is committed to maintaining the highest 
standards of corporate governance.
 Resolution 3 deals with the re-election of Directors. The Company's Articles of Association require that 
at least one third of the Directors shall retire by rotation at the Annual General Meeting every year. 
However, in compliance with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Directors will 
retire and present themselves for re-election by the shareholders, with the exception of Michael Horgan 
who, having served as Director for over 14 years, retires this year and does not offer himself for 
reelection. Biographical details of the Directors are found on pages 114 and 115 of the 2015 Annual 
Report. In addition shareholders are being asked to approve the election of Howard Millar and John Leahy 
as Directors. Howard Millar served as Ryanair's Deputy Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer from 
2003 until he retired in December 2014. Captain John Leahy had been a pilot at British Airways for 35 
years.  He retired in 2003 from the position of Chief Pilot on B-747.
 Resolution 4 deals with the authority of the Directors to fix the remuneration of the auditors.
 Special Business
 In addition to the ordinary business there is the following special business:
 Resolution 5 - Directors' Authority to Allot Ordinary Shares
 The Directors are seeking to renew their authority to allot shares in the authorised but unissued share 
capital of the Company for the period up to September 23, 2020.
 Resolution 6 - Disapplication of Statutory Pre-emption Rights
 As was the case at previous years' Annual General Meetings, the Directors are seeking authority to allot 
Ordinary Shares without first offering them to existing shareholders in accordance with statutory pre-
emption rights where the Ordinary Shares are allotted:
 (a)          On the exercise of any option in accordance with the provisions of the existing Ryanair 
Holdings plc Share Option Plan of 2013;
 (b)          In connection with a rights issue; and
 (c)          Otherwise than in pursuance of (a) and (b) above, up to an aggregate nominal value of the 
greater of EUR429,625 or  5% of the then issued share capital of the Company.
 It is proposed to renew this authority for the period expiring fifteen months from the passing of this 
Resolution or, if earlier, on the day following the next Annual General Meeting of the Company.
 Resolution 7 - Authority to Repurchase Shares
 The Directors are seeking the authority to make market purchases and/or overseas market purchases (as 
defined by Section 1072 of the Companies Act, 2014) of the Company's Ordinary Shares and American 
Depositary Shares (ADSs).   Any ADSs repurchased will be converted to Ordinary Shares and cancelled as 
will Ordinary Shares repurchased, and the number of Ordinary Shares in issue will reduce accordingly.
 The maximum price at which Ordinary Shares traded on the Irish Stock Exchange or the London Stock 
Exchange could be repurchased would be the higher of (i) 5% above the average market value of the 
Company's Ordinary Shares on the trading venue where the shares are being repurchased for the five 
business days prior to the date of purchase; and (ii) the price stipulated by Article 5(1) of Commission 
Regulation (EC) of December 22, 2003 (No. 2273/2003), being the higher of the last independent trade and 
the highest current independent bid on the trading venue on which the shares are being repurchased. It is 
further proposed that the maximum price at which Ordinary Shares which underlie the Company's ADSs which 
are traded on NASDAQ could be repurchased would be 5% above the average market value of one-fifth of the 
Company's ADSs on NASDAQ for the five business days prior to the date of purchase (as one ADS represents 
five Ordinary Shares).
 The minimum price at which Ordinary Shares could be repurchased would be their nominal value of 0.635 
euro cents (EUR0.00635). The authority will also enable the Company to repurchase in US dollars or euro.
 Resolutions 8 and 9 - Companies Act 2014
Ryanair Holdings PLC Notice of AGM
 There are two further Special Resolutions, the purpose of which is to take account of the changes to 
company law brought about by the Companies Act 2014, which was commenced for most purposes on 1 June 2015. 
The proposed Resolutions will amend the Memorandum of Association and adopt revised Articles of 
Association to take account of the consolidation and amendment of company law effected by the Companies 
Act 2014, and to make some consequential and housekeeping changes. A summary of the amendments which are 
proposed to be made to the Memorandum and Articles of Association is set out in an Appendix immediately 
following the attached AGM Notice.
 A copy of the Memorandum and Articles of Association as proposed to be amended by the Resolutions (if 
passed) is available on            www.ryanair.com and a copy will also be available for inspection at the 
registered office of the Company during normal business hours Monday to Friday (excluding public holiday) 
from the date of this notice up to and including the date of the AGM, and at the Radisson Blu Hotel, 
Dublin Airport, Co. Dublin, Ireland immediately before and during the Annual General Meeting.
 Recommendation of Directors
 The Directors believe that the passing of the Resolutions set out in the Notice of Meeting is in the best 
interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and the Directors unanimously recommend that you 
vote in favour of such Resolutions as they intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings in 
Ordinary Shares which, as at the date of this letter, represent approximately 4.5% of the issued share 
capital of the Company.
 Yours sincerely,
 David Bonderman
 Chairman

 Transaction in own shares
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") has previously announced an intention to return capital to shareholders by 
way of a share buy-back programme to be conducted pursuant to irrevocable arrangements with its brokers, 
Citigroup Global Markets Limited ("Citi") and J&E Davy ("Davy"). The Company today announces that on 16 June 
2016 it purchased for cancellation a total of 200,000 ordinary shares of nominal value EUR0.006 each in the capital 
of the Company ("Ordinary Shares").
 The Ordinary Shares repurchased have been repurchased at an average price of EUR12.5394 per Ordinary Share 
(high of EUR12.5527 and low of EUR12.5315).
 In respect of this programme, which will operate until not later than 31 October 2016, Citi and Davy will make 
trading decisions in relation to Ryanair's Ordinary Shares and American Depositary Receipts repurchased under 
the buy-back programme independently of, and uninfluenced by, Ryanair.  Any such acquisitions will be effected 
within certain pre-set parameters, and in accordance with both Ryanair's general authority to repurchase Ordinary 
Shares and Ordinary Shares underlying American Depositary Receipts, and Chapter 9 of the Listing Rules of the 
Irish Stock Exchange.
 Following the cancellation of the Ordinary Shares repurchased the Company will have 1,270,090,145 Ordinary 
Shares in issue. To the extent that further Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares underlying American 
Depositary Receipts) are repurchased under the programme, these will also be cancelled.

In just five years, Ryanair has smashed Iberia's high fare monopoly by
guaranteeing Spanish passengers the lowest fares and no fuel surcharges ever.
This has driven down the cost of travel and delivered an annual EUR2bn tourism
spend in the Spanish regions.
Ryanair's new base in Reus Barcelona will replicate the success of our existing
bases in Alicante, Girona, Madrid and Valencia, transforming tourism to the
region and saving passengers EUR100m p.a. compared to Iberia's high fares and fuel
surcharges.
Announcing Ryanair's 26th European base in Reus, CEO Michael O'Leary said:
        "We congratulate Reus for fighting off stiff competition from seven
         other airports across Europe to win this new base which guarantees over
         1m passengers p.a and two new aircraft worth over $140m for 12 Ryanair
         routes.
        "Ryanair will now develop the region's massive untapped potential by
         giving the tourism industry year round low fare access to Europe's
         largest cities. The 1m passengers that Ryanair delivers to/from Reus
         next year will generate a local visitor spend of at least EUR150m.
        "All of Ryanair's routes from Reus are available until midnight Thursday
         for just EUR5 and we advise passengers to book early as demand will be
         very strong".

 RYANAIR CALLS FOR URGENT ACTION TO PREVENT MELTDOWN OF EUROPE'S AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (ATC)
 ATC STAFF SHORTAGES/STRIKES CRISIS IS DISRUPTING MILLIONS OF PASSENGERS THIS SUMMER
 Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, today (14 June) called for urgent action by the EU Commission and 
European Governments to arrest the alarming deterioration in Europe's ATC services during the months of 
May and June, and prevent a full meltdown of ATC services this summer.
 In May 2018:
 --     Over 117,000 flights were delayed with 61% (over 71,000 flights) due to ATC staff shortages and 
strikes.
 --     Over 56,000 flights were delayed more than 15 minutes, a fourfold increase on the 14,000 flights 
delayed more than 15 minutes in May 2017.
 --     Weather delays accounted for 39% (45,000 flights), a fourfold increase in the 11,000 weather 
delays of May 2017.
 --     Strangely, a majority (almost 60%) of these weather delays took place on Fridays and Saturdays 
rather than the other 5 days of the week, which suggests that ATC providers are using adverse weather to 
cover their staff shortages.
 --     The EU target delay for 2018 is an average of 0.5 minutes per flight. However, the current 
forecast for 2018 is now heading towards 1.5 minutes per flight, nearly treble the EU target.
 --     In May, Ryanair cancelled just over 1,000 flights, almost all due to ATC staff shortages and 
strikes. This was 24 times the 43 flights cancelled in May 2017.
 --     In May, EasyJet cancelled 974 flights compared to just 117 in May 2017.
 --     In May, IAG CEO Willie Walsh said: "The thing most impacted is ATC strikes and the ongoing ATC 
environment, which is a mess. It is destroying traffic throughout Europe. We thought it would get better 
in 2018 but it's getting worse".
 Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said:
 "Yet again this weekend, French ATC will strike on Saturday and Sunday leading to hundreds of flights 
being cancelled, disrupting the holiday plans of thousands of passengers. Many of these flights don't even 
touch France, yet they will be disruptive because French ATC requires airlines to cancel overflights while 
they 
protect 
French 
domestic 
routes. 
Europe's 
airlines 
are 
also 
suffering 
thousands 
of 
ATC 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR CALLS FOR ACTION TO PREVENT ATC MELTDOWN
delays/cancellations because of staff shortages especially in German and UK ATC providers. These 
disruptions are unacceptable, and we call on the UK and German Governments, and the EU Commission to take 
urgent and decisive action to ensure that ATC providers are fully staffed and that overflights are not 
affected when national strikes take place, as they repeatedly do in France.
 Europe's ATC providers are approaching the point of meltdown with hundreds of flights being cancelled 
daily simply because they don't have enough staff to deal with them. The situation is particularly acute 
at weekends where British and German ATC providers are hiding behind adverse weather and euphemisms such 
as "capacity restrictions" when the truth is they are not rostering enough ATC staff to cater for the 
number of flights that are scheduled to operate.
 Urgent action must now be taken by the UK and German Governments, and the EU Commission, otherwise 
thousands more flights and millions of passengers will be disrupted, particularly in the peak months of 
July and August, unless this ATC staffing crisis is addressed".

Ryanair regrets that the German Govt's EUR8 tourist tax now makes Germany an uncompetitive tourist destination 
at a time when many other EU Govts (including Holland, Belgium, Greece and Spain) have scrapped tourist taxes 
altogether and/or reduced airport charges, in some cases to zero, in order to grow traffic and tourism. Even the Irish 
Govt last week recognised the damage done to Irish tourism and jobs and has slashed its failed EUR10 tourist tax 
to just EUR3.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "The German Govt's EUR8 tourist tax continues to inflict significant damage on traffic, tourism and jobs in 
Germany. Ryanair has now announced deep cuts at Berlin, Bremen, Dusseldorf Weeze and Frankfurt Hahn for 
summer 2011 with the loss of 3m passengers p.a. and over 3,000 jobs at German airports. International experience 
shows that tourist taxes cause a large traffic and tourism collapses in both Ireland and the UK and we believe that 
this ill advised EUR8 tourist tax will inflict similar damage to German tourism and jobs.
 Ryanair will move these aircraft to bases outside Germany which welcome tourists instead of taxing them. We urge 
the German Govt to look again at the damaging impact of tourist taxes in Ireland and the UK before this EUR8 
tourist tax leads to similar declines in traffic and jobs at German airports. Even the Irish Govt recognised the 
damage that its EUR10 tourist tax has done to Irish tourism and jobs and last week slashed the tax from EUR10 to 
EUR3 in 2011."

 Depreciation and amortization.Ryanair's depreciation and amortization per passenger increased by 2.0%, while in 
absolute terms these costs increased 6.6% from EUR309.2 million in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR329.6 million in the 
2013 fiscal year. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of 11 owned aircraft to the fleet during the 
2013 fiscal year. See "-Critical Accounting Policies-Long-lived Assets" above.
 Fuel and oil. Ryanair's fuel and oil costs per passenger increased by 13.2%, while in absolute terms, these costs 
increased by 18.3% from EUR1,593.6 million in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR1,884.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, in 
each case after giving effect to the Company's fuel hedging activities. The 18.3% increase reflected a 15% increase 
in average fuel prices paid and the impact of a 3.7% increase in the number of hours flown, which were offset in 
part by a 2.2% decrease in the average sector length. Fuel and oil costs include the direct cost of fuel, the cost of 
delivering fuel to the aircraft, aircraft de-icing and EU emissions trading costs. The average fuel price paid by 
Ryanair (calculated by dividing total fuel costs by the number of U.S. gallons of fuel consumed) increased 14.4% 
from EUR2.08 per U.S. gallon in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR2.38 per U.S. gallon in the 2013 fiscal year, in each 
case after giving effect to the Company's fuel hedging activities.
 Maintenance, materials and repairs. Ryanair's maintenance, materials and repair expenses, which consist primarily 
of the cost of routine maintenance, provision for leased aircraft and the overhaul of spare parts, increased 11.0% on 
a per-passenger basis, while in absolute terms these expenses increased by 16.0% from EUR104.0 million in the 
2012 fiscal year to EUR120.7 million in the 2013 fiscal year. The increase in absolute terms during the fiscal year 
reflected the additional costs arising from increased level of activity and the opening of new bases.
 Aircraft rentals. Aircraft rental expenses amounted to EUR98.2 million in the 2013 fiscal year, an 8.2% increase 
from the EUR90.7 million reported in the 2012 fiscal year, reflecting the negative impact of higher lessor financing 
costs and the adverse impact of changes in the euro/dollar exchange rate on new leased aircraft and the handback 
of 4 aircraft due to the maturity of leases.
 Route charges and airport and handling charges. Ryanair's route charges per passenger increased 1.1% in the 
2013 fiscal year, while airport and handling charges per passenger increased 5.6%. In absolute terms, route 
charges increased 5.7%, from EUR460.5 million in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR486.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, 
primarily as a result of the 4.7% increase in sectors flown. In absolute terms, airport and handling charges 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -37-
increased 10.4%, from EUR554.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year, to EUR611.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, 
reflecting the overall growth in passenger volumes and higher charges at Dublin and London (Stansted) airports, 
partially offset by lower average costs at Ryanair's newer airports and bases.
 Marketing, distribution and other expenses. Ryanair's marketing, distribution and other operating expenses, 
including those applicable to the generation of ancillary revenues, increased 5.2% on a per-passenger basis in the 
2013 fiscal year, while in absolute terms, these costs increased 9.9%, from EUR180.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year 
to EUR197.9 million in the 2013 fiscal year, with the overall increase primarily reflecting the higher level of activity 
and increased onboard product costs reflecting the higher level of sales.
 Operating profit.  As a result of the factors outlined above, operating profit increased 0.6% on a per-passenger 
basis in the 2013 fiscal year, and also increased in absolute terms, from EUR683.2 million in the 2012 fiscal year to 
EUR718.2 million in the 2013 fiscal year.
 Finance income. Ryanair's interest and similar income decreased 38.2%, from EUR44.3 million in the 2012 fiscal 
year to EUR27.4 million in the 2013 fiscal year, reflecting the reduced yields on term deposits.
 Finance expense. Ryanair's interest and similar charges decreased 9.0%, from EUR109.2 million in the 2012 fiscal 
year to EUR99.3 million in the 2013 fiscal year, primarily due to lower interest rates in the 2013 fiscal year 
compared to the 2012 fiscal year. These costs are expected to increase as Ryanair further expands its fleet.
 Foreign exchange gains/losses.Ryanair recorded foreign exchange gains of EUR4.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, 
as compared with foreign exchange gains of EUR4.3 million in the 2012 fiscal year, with the different result being 
primarily due to the positive impact of changes in the U.K. pound sterling and the U.S. dollar exchange rates 
against the euro.
 Taxation. The effective tax rate for the 2013 fiscal year was 12.5%, as compared to an effective tax rate of 11.5% 
in the 2012 fiscal year. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory rate of Irish corporation tax of 12.5%. Ryanair 
recorded an income tax provision of EUR81.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, compared with a tax provision of 
EUR72.6 million in the 2012 fiscal year, with the increase primarily reflecting higher pre-tax profits. The 
determination regarding the recoverability of the deferred tax asset was based on future income forecasts, which 
demonstrated that it was more likely than not that future profits would be available in order to utilize the deferred tax 
asset. A deferred tax asset's recoverability is not dependent on material improvements over historical levels of pre-
tax income, material changes in the present relationship between income reported for financial and tax purposes, or 
material asset sales or other non-routine transactions.
 FISCAL YEAR 2012 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2011
 Profit after taxation. Ryanair recorded a profit on ordinary activities after taxation of EUR560.4 million in the 2012 
fiscal year, as compared with a profit of EUR374.6 million in the 2011 fiscal year. This profit was primarily 
attributable to an increase in revenues driven by a 15.6% increase in average fares and a 10.6% increase in 
ancillary revenues, partially offset by a 29.9% increase in fuel and oil costs from EUR1,227.0 million to EUR1,593.6 
million.
 Scheduled revenues. Ryanair's scheduled passenger revenues increased 23.9%, from EUR2,827.9 million in the 
2011 fiscal year, to EUR3,504.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year, primarily reflecting an increase of 15.6% in average 
fares. The number of passengers booked increased 5.2%, from 72.1 million to 75.8 million, reflecting increased 
passenger volumes on existing routes and the successful launch of new bases at Manchester, Wroclaw, Baden-
Baden, Billund, Palma, Paphos and Budapest in the 2012 fiscal year. There was a one percentage point decrease 
in booked passenger load factors from 83% in fiscal 2011 to 82% in fiscal 2012.
 Passenger capacity during the 2012 fiscal year increased by 12.3% due to the addition of 22 Boeing 737-800 
aircraft (net of handbacks), as well as a 5.8% increase in sectors flown and a 6.1% increase in the average length 
of passenger haul. Scheduled passenger revenues accounted for 79.8% of Ryanair's total revenues for the 2012 
fiscal year, compared with 77.9% of total revenues in the 2011 fiscal year.
 During fiscal year 2012, changes in estimates relating to the timing of revenue recognition for unused passenger 
tickets were made, resulting in increased revenue in the 2012 fiscal year of EUR65.3 million.  This change reflects 
more accurate and timely data obtained through system enhancements.
 Ancillary revenues. Ryanair's ancillary revenues, which comprise revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, 
in-flight sales and Internet-related services, increased 10.6%, from EUR801.6 million in the 2011 fiscal year to 
EUR886.2 million in the 2012 fiscal year, while ancillary revenues per booked passenger increased to EUR11.69 
from EUR11.12. Revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, including revenues from excess baggage 
charges, debit and credit card transactions, sales of rail and bus tickets, accommodation, travel insurance and car 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -37-
rental increased 12.4% to EUR645.6 million from EUR574.2 million in the 2011 fiscal year. Revenues from in-flight 
sales increased 6.4%, to EUR107.2 million from EUR100.7 million in the 2011 fiscal year. Revenues from Internet-
related services, primarily commissions received from products sold on Ryanair.com or linked websites, increased 
5.3%, from EUR126.7 million in the 2011 fiscal year to EUR133.4 million in the 2012 fiscal year. The rate of 
increase in revenues from all ancillary revenue categories exceeded the increase in overall passengers booked.

expressed as a percentage of total ancillary revenues for each of the periods indicated:

 RYANAIR CUTS WINTER FLIGHTS & JOBS AS
 IRISH GOVT'S EUR10 TAX DEVASTATES TOURISM
Ryanair, Ireland's largest airline, today (17th June 09) announced cuts in its
 winter based aircraft, flights and jobs at Dublin and Shannon Airports as the
 Government's EUR10 tourist tax continues to devastate Irish traffic and tourism.
In the first five months of 2009 traffic at Dublin Airport has fallen by 11%, a
 loss of 1 million passengers in just five months. If this traffic collapse
 continues for the full year it will mean the loss of 2.5 million passengers,
 2,500 jobs at Dublin Airport and EUR750 million of tourism spend in the Irish
 economy in 2009.
Ryanair today announced that it will cut its base aircraft by one at both Dublin
 (from 17 to 16) and Shannon (from 4 to 3) this winter, resulting in the loss of
 350,000 passengers and 350 jobs at Dublin Airport and a further 300,000
 passengers and 300 jobs in Shannon Airport.
Further cuts in winter flight and traffic numbers will be announced in the
 coming months if the Government fails to scrap this EUR10 tourist tax. Ryanair
 will switch these aircraft and continue to grow in lower cost/no tourist tax
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Cuts Winter Flights And Jobs
 countries such as Belgium, Holland, Greece and Spain where governments have
 recently scrapped tourist taxes and airport charges to promote tourism.
Ryanair confirmed that these winter cutbacks can be reversed if the Government
 scraps its EUR10 tourist tax.
Ryanair announced reductions as follows for the winter 2009 schedule:
*  A 25% cut in Shannon based aircraft (4 to 3).
 *  A 6% cut in Dublin based aircraft (17 to 16).
 *  A cut of 36 flights per week at Shannon.
 *  A cut of 44 flights per week at Dublin.
 *  The loss of 650 airport and tourism jobs.
 *  The loss of EUR750 million in tourism spend.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"The Irish Government's EUR10 tourist tax is "tourism suicide" which
 is devastating visitor numbers and jobs.  Price sensitive visitors are switching
 to lower cost destinations in Europe where governments welcome tourists, not tax
 them.
"Ryanair will remove one aircraft from both Dublin and Shannon this winter and
 further cuts can be expected in the coming months if the EUR10 tourist tax is not
 scrapped.  If the tourist tax is scrapped these cuts, and the tourism collapse,
 will be reversed.
This tourist tax will raise just EUR125 million per annum and for this tiny tax
 revenue the Irish government will lose over 2,500 jobs and more than EUR750
 million in tourism spend, the VAT receipts on which would exceed EUR150 million".

 The Company's net cash inflows from operating activities in the 2013 and 2012 fiscal years amounted to 
EUR1,023.5 million and EUR1,020.3 million, respectively. The EUR3.2 million increase in net cash flows from 
operating activities for fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was principally due to a number of factors including 
a EUR493.8 million increase in operating revenues, due to a combination of a 4.3% increase in average fares, a 
4.5% increase in booked passengers and a 20.1% increase in ancillary revenues, partially offset by a EUR291.0 
million, or 18.3%, increase in fuel and oil costs, due to the increase in the level of activity and increases in the 
average price of fuel, and a EUR146.4 million, or 8.1%, increase in non-fuel related operating expenses (excluding 
a EUR20.4 million, or 6.6%, increase in non-cash depreciation) due to the growth of the business.  In addition, 
movements in working capital, related principally to cash received in advance for flights, and receipt of other 
receivables and increases in other payables balances, generated EUR67.4 million in cash in 2013, compared with 
EUR101.8 million in 2012. This decrease in net cash generated from working capital of EUR34.4 million, or 
approximately 34%, is primarily due to the timing of Easter, which led to lower future fly revenues at year end.
 The Company's net cash inflows from investing activities in fiscal year 2014 totaled EUR300.7 million, primarily 
reflecting, as compared to fiscal year 2013, the Company's decreased investment of cash with maturities of greater 
than three months, as described in more detail below
 The Company's net cash used in investing activities in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 totaled EUR1,821.5 million and 
EUR185.4 million, respectively, primarily reflecting the Company's capital expenditures, and increased investment 
of cash with maturities of greater than three months, as described in more detail below.
 Net cash used in financing activities totaled EUR856.1 million in the 2014 fiscal year, largely reflecting the 
repayments of long-term borrowings of EUR390.8 million and shares purchased under a share buy-back program of 
EUR481.7 million, offset in part by shares issued of EUR16.4 million. Net cash used in financing activities totaled 
EUR669.4 million in fiscal year 2013.  This was due to the receipt of proceeds from long term borrowings of 
EUR234.6 million and shares issued of EUR21.4 million, offset in part by repayments of long-term borrowings of 
EUR366.4 million, the payment of a EUR491.5 million dividend and shares purchased under a share buy-back 
program of EUR67.5 million.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -42-
 The Company experienced a net cash outflow from financing activities of EUR154.9 million in fiscal year 2012. This 
was due to the receipt of proceeds from long term borrowings of EUR292.3 million being more than offset by 
repayments of long-term borrowings of EUR329.7 million and the expenditure of EUR124.6 million under the share 
buy-back program.
 Capital Expenditures. The Company's net cash outflows for capital expenditures in fiscal years 2014 and 2013 
were EUR505.8 million and EUR310.7 million, respectively. Ryanair has funded a significant portion of its 
acquisition of new Boeing 737-800 aircraft and related equipment through borrowings under facilities provided by 
international financial institutions on the basis of guarantees issued by the Export-Import Bank of the United States 
("Ex-Im Bank"). At March 31, 2014, Ryanair had a fleet of 297 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, the majority of which (210 
aircraft) were funded by Ex-Im Bank-guaranteed financing. Other sources of on-balance-sheet aircraft financing 
utilized by Ryanair are Japanese Operating Leases with Call Options ("JOLCOs"), which are treated as finance 
leases (30 of the aircraft in the fleet as of March 31, 2014) and commercial debt financing (6 of the aircraft in the 
fleet as of March 31, 2014). Of Ryanair's total fleet of 297 Boeing 737-800 aircraft at March 31, 2014 there were 51 
aircraft which were financed through operating lease arrangements. Ryanair has generally been able to generate 
sufficient funds from operations to meet its non-aircraft acquisition-related working capital requirements. 
Management believes that the working capital available to the Company is sufficient for its present requirements 
and will be sufficient to meet its anticipated requirements for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for 
the 2015 fiscal year.
 The Company's net cash outflows for capital expenditures in fiscal year 2012 was EUR290.4 million. Of the 25 new 
Boeing 737-800 aircraft which Ryanair took delivery of between April 1, 2011 and March 31, 2012, 11 were 
financed through sale-and-leaseback financings and the remainder through Ex-Im Bank guaranteed-financing.
 The following table sets forth the dates on which and the number of aircraft that will be delivered to the Company 
pursuant to the 2013 Boeing Contract:

Capital Resources. Ryanair's long-term debt (including current maturities) totaled EUR3,083.6 million at March 31, 
2014 and EUR3,498.3 million at March 31, 2013, with the change being primarily attributable to the repayment of 
existing debt facilities. Please see the table "Obligations Due by Period" below for more information on Ryanair's 
long-term debt (including current maturities) and finance leases as of March 31, 2014. See also Note 11 to the 
consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 for further information on the maturity profile of the interest 
rate structure and other information on, the Company's borrowings.
 At March 31, 2014, the majority of the aircraft in Ryanair's fleet had been financed through loan facilities with 
various financial institutions active in the structured export finance sector and supported by a loan guarantee from 
Ex-Im Bank. Each of these facilities takes essentially the same form and is based on the documentation developed 
by Ryanair and Ex-Im Bank, which follows standard market forms for this type of financing. In November 2010, 
Ryanair financed seven aircraft through a U.S. dollar-denominated Ex-Im Bank Capital Markets Product 
("Eximbond"). The Eximbond has essentially the same characteristics as all previous Ex-Im Bank guaranteed 
financings with no additional obligations on Ryanair. On the basis of an Ex-Im Bank guarantee with regard to the 
financing of up to 85% of the eligible U.S. and foreign content represented in the net purchase price of the relevant 
aircraft, the financial institution investor enters into a commitment letter with the Company to provide financing for a 
specified number of aircraft benefiting from such guarantee; loans are then drawn down as the aircraft are delivered 
and payments to Boeing become due. Each of the loans under the facilities are on substantially similar terms, 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -42-
having a maturity of 12 years from the drawdown date and being secured by a first priority mortgage in favor of a 
security trustee on behalf of Ex-Im Bank.
 Through the use of interest rate swaps or cross currency interest rate swaps, Ryanair has effectively converted a 
portion of its floating-rate debt under its financing facilities into fixed-rate debt. Approximately 34% of the loans for 
the aircraft acquired under the above facilities are not covered by such swaps and have therefore remained at 
floating rates linked to EURIBOR, with the interest rate exposure from these loans largely hedged by placing a 
similar amount of cash on deposit at floating interest rates. The net result is that Ryanair has effectively swapped or 
drawn down fixed-rate euro-denominated debt with maturities between seven and twelve years in respect of 
approximately 66% of its outstanding debt financing at March 31, 2014 and of this total approximately 48% of this 
debt has been partially swapped, with the relevant swaps covering the first seven years of the twelve-year 
amortizing period.
 The table below illustrates the effect of swap transactions (each of which is with an established international 
financial counterparty) on the profile of Ryanair's total outstanding debt at March 31, 2014. See "Item 11. 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Interest Rate Exposure and Hedging" for additional 
details on the Company's hedging transactions.
At March 31, 2014                                                                   EUR          EUR

                   RYANAIR LAUNCHES 8 NEW ROUTES FROM SHANNON
                       100,000 SEATS FOR EUR10 TO CELEBRATE
Ryanair, Ireland's national airline, today (Wednesday, 7th November 2007)
launched eight new routes from its Shannon base to Birmingham, Fuerteventura,
Kaunas (Lithuania), Leeds, London Luton, Riga, Tenerife and its first domestic
service from Shannon to Dublin. Ryanair's 31 Shannon routes will deliver two
million passengers to the mid-west in the coming year, while supporting 2,000
jobs in the region.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Peter Sherrard said:
        "Ryanair is committed to delivering the lowest fares guaranteed to
         passengers in the mid-west, and these eight new routes provide an
         additional link to London from Shannon, while passengers can now also
         avoid the nightmare traffic on the M50 and N7, with flights to Dublin
         for less than half the price of a tank of petrol.
        "To celebrate these 8 new routes, Ryanair is giving away 100,000 seats
         for just EUR10, and passengers should log onto www.ryanair.com
         immediately, as this offer must end at midnight on Monday."

                 BAGGAGE CHARGES RISE TO REDUCE CHECKED IN BAGS
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Monday, 28th April 2008)
announced that it will continue its drive to increase the number of passengers
checking in on-line by increasing baggage and airport check-in charges from May
5. From this date Ryanair's checked in baggage fee will rise from EUR9 to EUR10
while airport check-in fees will increase from EUR4 to EUR5. Ryanair encourages
passengers to avoid these charges altogether by travelling with our 10kg hand
luggage allowance and checking in on-line.
Passengers who book their flights in the next week (before May 5) will avoid
these charges.
Announcing these charge increases, Ryanair's Peter Sherrard said:
"40% of Ryanair passengers currently avoid queues at both check-in and boarding
by availing of our free web check-in service, and this increase in baggage fees
Ryanair Holdings PLC Baggage Charges
will result in fewer checked in bags and more passengers changing to on-line
check-in.
"On-line check-in is faster, more efficient and costs Ryanair less. There is no
doubt that it is the future for air travel. We will continue to increase baggage
fees until half of our passengers check-in online, which will allow us to reduce
check-in and handling costs and pass on these savings to our passengers in the
form of Europe's guaranteed lowest fares.
"Ryanair will continue to drive down the cost of travel by reducing its average
fare (which includes baggage and check-in revenues) in 2008 and guaranteeing the
lowest fares on every route".

("IFRS") as adopted by the EU ("IFRS as adopted by the EU"), which are effective for the year ended and as 
at March 31, 2014.  In addition to complying with its legal obligation to comply with IFRS as adopted by

 New accounting standards adopted during the year
 The following new and amended standards, that have been issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB), and are effective under those standards for the first time for the financial year beginning

at fair value, and share-based payments, which are based on fair value determined as at the grant date of 
the relevant share options. Certain non-current assets, when they are classified as held for sale, are 
stated at the lower of cost and fair value less costs to sell.

 In addition, reservations on Ryanair's flights to London dropped materially for a number of days in the immediate 
aftermath of the terrorist attacks in London on July 7, 2005. Although the terrorist attack in Glasgow on June 30, 
2007 (in which a car filled with explosives was driven into Glasgow's airport) and the failed terrorist attacks in 
London on July 21, 2005 and June 29, 2007 had no material impact on bookings, there can be no assurance that 
future such attacks will not affect passenger traffic. In the 2011 fiscal year, 16.2 million passengers were booked on 
Ryanair's flights into and out of London, representing 22.5% of the total passengers booked on all of the Company's 
flights in the fiscal year. Future acts of terrorism or significant terrorist threats, particularly in London or other 
markets that are significant to Ryanair, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's profitability or 
financial condition should the public's willingness to travel to and from those markets decline as a result. See also "-
The 2001 Terrorist Attacks on the United States Had a Severe Negative Impact on the International Airline Industry" 
below.
 The 2001 Terrorist Attacks on the United States Had a Severe Negative Impact on the International Airline 
Industry. The terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, in which four commercial aircraft were 
hijacked, had a severe negative impact on the international airline industry, particularly on U.S. carriers and carriers 
operating international service to and from the United States. Although carriers such as Ryanair that operate 
primarily or exclusively in Europe were generally spared from such material adverse impacts on their businesses, 
the cost to all commercial airlines of insurance coverage for certain third-party liabilities arising from "acts of war" or 
terrorism increased dramatically after the September 11 attacks. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-
Insurance." In addition, Ryanair's insurers have indicated that the scope of the Company's current "act of war"-
related insurance may exclude certain types of catastrophic incidents, such as certain forms of biological, chemical 
or "dirty bomb" attacks. This could result in the Company's seeking alternative coverage, including government 
insurance or self-insurance, which could lead to further increases in costs. Although Ryanair to date has passed on 
increased insurance costs to passengers by means of a special "insurance levy" on each ticket, there can be no 
assurance that it will continue to be successful in doing so.
 Because a substantial portion of airline travel (both business and personal) is discretionary and because Ryanair is 
substantially dependent on discretionary air travel, any prolonged general reduction in airline passenger traffic may 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -20-
adversely affect the Company. Similarly, any significant increase in expenses related to security, insurance or 
related costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Any further terrorist attacks in the U.S. or in 
Europe, particularly in London or other markets that are significant to Ryanair, any significant military actions by the 
United States or EU nations or any related economic downturn may have a material adverse effect on demand for 
air travel and thus on Ryanair's business, operating results, and financial condition. See also "-Risks Related to the 
Company-Further Terrorist Attacks in London and Other Destinations Could Have a Detrimental Effect on the 
Company."
 The Company Faces the Risk of Loss and Liability. Ryanair is exposed to potential catastrophic losses that may be 
incurred in the event of an aircraft accident or terrorist incident. Any such accident or incident could involve costs 
related to the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequent temporary or permanent loss from 
service. In addition, an accident or incident could result in significant legal claims against the Company from injured 
passengers and others who experienced injury as a result of the accident or incident, including ground victims. 
Ryanair currently maintains passenger liability insurance, employer liability insurance, aircraft insurance for aircraft 
loss or damage, and other business insurance in amounts per occurrence that are consistent with industry 
standards.
 Ryanair currently believes its insurance coverage is adequate (although not comprehensive). However, there can 
be no assurance that the amount of insurance coverage will not need to be increased, that insurance premiums will 
not increase significantly, or that Ryanair will not be forced to bear substantial losses from any accidents not 
covered by its insurance. Airline insurance costs increased dramatically following the September 2001 terrorist 
attacks on the United States. See "-The 2001 Terrorist Attacks on the United States Had a Severe Negative Impact 
on the International Airline Industry" above. Substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of related 
insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial 
condition. Moreover, any aircraft accident, even if fully insured, could lead to the public perception that Ryanair's 
aircraft were less safe or reliable than those operated by other airlines, which could have a material adverse effect 
on Ryanair's business.
 EU Regulation No. 2027/97, as amended by Regulation No. 889/2002, governs air carrier liability. See "Item 4. 
Information on the Company-Insurance" for details of this regulation. This regulation increased the potential liability 
exposure of air carriers such as Ryanair. Although Ryanair has extended its liability insurance to meet the 
requirements of the regulation, no assurance can be given that other laws, regulations, or policies will not be 
applied, modified or amended in a manner that has a material adverse effect on Ryanair's business, operating 
results, and financial condition.
 Airline Industry Margins are Subject to Significant Uncertainty. The airline industry is characterized by high fixed 
costs and by revenues that generally exhibit substantially greater elasticity than costs. Although fuel accounted for 
approximately 39% of total operating expenses in the 2011 fiscal year, management anticipates that this 
percentage may vary significantly in future years. See "-Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel Availability Affect the 
Company's Results and Increase the Likelihood that the Company May Incur Losses" above. The operating costs of 
each flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers flown, and therefore, a relatively small change in 
the number of passengers, fare pricing, or traffic mix could have a disproportionate effect on operating and financial 
results. Accordingly, a relatively minor shortfall from expected revenue levels could have a material adverse effect 
on the Company's growth or financial performance. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects." 
The very low marginal costs incurred for providing services to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats are 
also a factor in the industry's high susceptibility to price discounting. See "-The Company Faces Significant Price 
and Other Pressures in a Highly Competitive Environment" above.
 Safety-Related Undertakings Could Affect the Company's Results. Aviation authorities in Europe and the United 
States periodically require or suggest that airlines implement certain safety-related procedures on their aircraft. In 
recent years, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (the "FAA") has required a number of such procedures with 
regard to Boeing 737-800 aircraft, including checks of rear pressure bulkheads and flight control modules, redesign 
of the rudder control system, and limitations on certain operating procedures. Ryanair's policy is to implement any 
such required procedures in accordance with FAA guidance and to perform such procedures in close collaboration 
with Boeing. To date, all such procedures have been conducted as part of Ryanair's standard maintenance 
program and have not interrupted flight schedules nor required any material increases in Ryanair's maintenance 
expenses. However, there can be no assurance that the FAA or other regulatory authorities will not recommend or 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -20-
require other safety-related undertakings or that such undertakings would not adversely impact the Company's 
operating results or financial condition.
 There also can be no assurance that new regulations will not be implemented in the future that would apply to 
Ryanair's aircraft and result in an increase in Ryanair's cost of maintenance or other costs beyond management's 
current estimates. In addition, should Ryanair's aircraft cease to be sufficiently reliable or should any public 
perception develop that Ryanair's aircraft are less than completely reliable, the Company's business could be 
materially adversely affected.
 Currency Fluctuations Affect the Company's Results. Although the Company is headquartered in Ireland, a 
significant portion of its operations is conducted in the U.K. Consequently, the Company has significant operating 
revenues and operating expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, denominated in U.K. pounds sterling. In 
addition, fuel, aircraft, insurance, and some maintenance obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars. The 
Company's results of operations and financial condition can therefore be significantly affected by fluctuations in the 
respective values of the U.K. pound sterling and the U.S. dollar. Ryanair is particularly subject to direct exchange 
rate risks between the euro and the U.S. dollar because a significant portion of its operating costs are incurred in 
U.S. dollars and none of its revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars.
 Although the Company engages in foreign currency hedging transactions between the euro and the U.S. dollar, 
between the euro and the U.K. pound sterling, and between the U.K. pound sterling and the U.S. dollar, hedging 
activities cannot be expected to eliminate currency risks. See "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Discussion 
About Market Risk."

 RYANAIR SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE BOEING 737 "GAMECHANGER" ORDER AT EGM
 99.93% VOTE IN FAVOUR OF NEW 200 AIRCRAFT ORDER
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (28 Nov) announced that its order to purchase up to 200 Boeing 
"gamechanger" 737 MAX aircraft (100 firm & 100 options)  has been approved by 99.93% of shareholders who 
voted at its EGM in Dublin this morning. When finalised (and if all options are exercised) this deal will 
be valued at over $22bn at current list prices.
 Ryanair is the lead customer for this new Boeing aircraft which will feature 197 seats (8 more than 
Ryanair's existing 737-800s), more leg room, new Boeing Sky Interiors, and CFM LEAP-1B engines, which will 
reduce fuel consumption by up to 18% in Ryanair's configuration and reduce noise emissions by 40%.
 These aircraft will further reduce Ryanair's industry leading unit costs, and these savings will be 
passed on via lower fares to Ryanair's customers, which will now grow from 82m in 2014 to over 150m 
customers p.a. by the end of the delivery stream in FY2024.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "Ryanair is proud and honoured to become the lead operator of Boeing's 737 "gamechanger" aircraft. This 
order will expand our fleet to approx 520 aircraft by 2024 and create another 10,000 new jobs for pilots, 
cabin crew and engineers in Europe, while allowing us to grow our traffic to over 150m p.a.
 These new "gamechanger" aircraft will allow Ryanair to lower our costs and airfares, while improving our 
customer experience with more leg room and Boeing Sky Interiors, as part of our "Always Getting Better" 
customer experience improvement programme.
 We wish to sincerely thank our Board and shareholders for their overwhelming support for this new 
"gamechanger" aircraft order."

                  RYANAIR TO REVOLUTIONISE EUROPEAN AIR TRAVEL
- FARES REDUCED BY 9% (GBP2.50 OR EUR3.50) FROM 16TH MARCH '06
- WEB CHECK-IN TO ELIMINATE CHECK-IN AND AIRPORT QUEUES
- LUGGAGE ALLOWANCES INCREASED FROM 25KGS TO 30KGS
- PASSENGERS ONLY PAY FOR THE BAGGAGE SERVICE THEY USE
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Wednesday, 25th January 2006)
announced details of its next revolution in European low fare air travel. From
the 16th March, Ryanair will introduce a number of key service improvements for
all passengers including (1) all Ryanair's fares will be reduced by 9% (GBP2.50 or
EUR3.50), (2) all passengers travelling with hand luggage and in possession of an
EU passport will be able to check-in on the web at www.ryanair.com and by-pass
all check-in and airport queues, (3) these passengers will also be given
priority boarding which will also eliminate boarding gate queues as well, (4)
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Revolutionise Travel
for bookings after 16th March, Ryanair is increasing each passenger's luggage
allowance from the current 25kgs to 30 kgs (comprising 10kgs carry-on and 20kgs
checked-in luggage) which will substantially reduce excess baggage fees and
finally (5) all passengers travelling with checked in luggage who book after
16th March will now pay a fee of GBP2.50 (EUR3.50) per bag, per flight if booked in
advance on the website, or GBP5.00 (EUR7.00) per bag, per flight if presented
unbooked at the airport.
As a result of these changes, those 25% of Ryanair's passengers who presently
travel with just hand luggage will avail of lower fares, will avoid the
inconvenience of check-in or boarding gate queues and will no longer cross
subsidise those passengers travelling with checked in luggage. A further 50% of
Ryanair's current traffic (who travel with just one checked in bag) will see no
change in their cost of travel, as the GBP2.50 ticket price reduction will fund
their GBP2.50 baggage fee if booked on the internet. These passengers will enjoy
much shorter queues at check-in thanks to the large numbers of people who will
now switch to web check-in, thereby reducing the airport check-in queues. Lastly
those passengers who presently travel with more than one checked in bag will see
the cost of their travel rise by the GBP2.50 (EUR3.50) per bag for their second and
subsequent bags. These passengers will also enjoy shorter check-in queues, and
will be encouraged to travel with less checked in luggage which would then make
these changes cost neutral for them as well.
This 9% "across the board" reduction in Ryanair's ticket prices from 16th March
will make these changes revenue neutral for Ryanair. The airline estimates that
the reduction in ticket revenues and excess baggage fees will cost Ryanair more
than GBP100m per annum. These lower fares will stimulate further traffic growth
and increase the current (50%) price differential between Ryanair's prices and
the average ticket prices of our higher fare competitors such as Easyjet. We
expect as a result of these measures, and in particular the attraction of web
check-in and priority boarding that more and more of Ryanair's customers will be
incentivised to travel with hand luggage only and take advantage of Ryanair's
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Revolutionise Travel
industry leading 10kgs of carry-on luggage.
The upside for Ryanair in these initiatives will be the opportunity to
significantly reduce airport and handling costs. We believe that between 40% to
50% of passengers will quickly switch to our new web check-in/priority boarding
service. This will allow Ryanair to reduce the number of check-in desks, baggage
hall and other handling facilities we rent at major airports. It will
significantly reduce the number of check-in and baggage handling staff required
to handle individual flights, although the airline expects few reductions in
staffing numbers in these areas, as existing numbers will be required to handle
our rapid growth. Ryanair believes that its airport and handling costs will be
reduced by over 10%, which equate to a saving of some EUR30m. This saving would
equate to 10% of Ryanair's current year forecast after tax profits.
Announcing these changes in London, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's Chief Executive
said:
    "Many sceptics have doubted whether Ryanair could drive its fares even
     lower. Well today we prove the doubters wrong. From 16th March next, Ryanair
     will reduce its fares by almost 10% across the board. Ryanair will also
     become the first low fares airline in Europe to make web check-in available
     for all our customers and we believe that this service will prove enormously
     attractive to passengers who wish to avoid those frustrating queues at
     airport check-in, at security, and at the boarding gate as well.
    "These changes will also be welcomed by the overwhelming majority of our
     remaining passengers who will still be checking in one bag, as these
     passengers will enjoy lower air fares, but also shorter and faster moving
     queues at airport check-in. We have no doubt that this pioneering
     development for checked in bags is the way forward, as it will encourage and
     incentivise more passengers on short-haul journeys to travel with hand
     luggage only. Ryanair's higher carry-on limit of 10kgs, and our new
     increased checked in allowance of 20kgs will largely eliminate excess
     baggage charges.
    "These changes will enable Ryanair to reduce our airport and handling costs
     across the network. We will require fewer and less expensive airport
     facilities such as airport check-in and baggage hall facilities. We will
     carry fewer bags making our aircraft lighter and improving our fuel
     consumption. Our existing check-in and baggage handling personnel will now
     be able to accommodate significantly greater traffic numbers as we aim to
     double the size of the airline over the coming five years.
    "Ryanair started the low fares revolution in Europe back in 1990. We have
     continued to pioneer changes in both the cost and practice of air travel
     over the past 15 years. Today's announcement takes this revolution one step
     further. With a 9% reduction in Europe's lowest air fares and the first web
     check-in facility for low fare passengers, we believe that up to half of
     Ryanair's passengers will now be encouraged to avoid airport queues.
     Short-haul travel in Europe will never have been cheaper or more convenient
     than Ryanair will make it this year".

                         ENCOURAGE FREE ONLINE CHECK-IN
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Wednesday, 23rd January 2008)
announced that it is increasing checked-in baggage and airport check-in fees
with immediate effect for all new bookings as part of its continued drive to
encourage passengers to travel without checked in bags and avail of Ryanair's
free of charge online check in.
For all bookings made from today onwards, Ryanair's checked in baggage fee will
increase from GBP5 to GBP6 per bag and the airport check-in fee will increase from
GBP2 to GBP3. Ryanair hopes that these increases will encourage more passengers to
avoid these charges by travelling with its generous hand luggage allowance
(10kg) and checking in free of charge on-line, which also has the benefit of
free priority boarding.
Ryanair Holdings PLC BAGGAGE CHARGES INCREASE
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications Peter Sherrard said:
        "Ryanair remains determined to encourage more and more passengers to
         travel with carry on luggage only, which allows them to use our free of
         charge web check-in, skip airport queues and enjoy our priority boarding
         service free of charge.
        "We have already seen huge increases in the numbers of passengers using
         Ryanair's internet check-in since we made it free of charge last
         September. These increased charges will incentivise even more passengers
         to use our free web check-in service allowing us to cut airport and
         handling costs and further reduce our guaranteed lowest fares as we grow
         from 50 million to 60 million passengers in the coming year.
        "These will not be the last increases in Ryanair's checked in baggage or
         airport check in fees, which will continue to increase over time until
         we reach our objective of persuading at least 50% of all Ryanair
         passengers to travel with hand luggage only, use our free web check-in
         service and avoid airport check-in queues. This will in turn allow us to
         reduce the number of airport check-in desks that we rent and the
         handling staff we employ so that we can continue to pass on these
         handling savings in the form of Europe's guaranteed lowest fares"

         Ryanair's low fares and

 LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN TO THE SHAREHOLDERS
 OF RYANAIR HOLDINGS PLC
 Dear Shareholder,
 I am pleased to inform you that the Annual Report and Financial Statements for Ryanair Holdings plc for 
the year ended March 31, 2014, are now available on our website www.ryanair.com. You will find the Notice 
of the Annual General Meeting set out on pages 3 to 5 of this document. The Annual General Meeting will be 
held on September 25, 2014 at 9.00 a.m. in the Ryanair Dublin Office, Airside Business Park, Swords, Co. 
Dublin, Ireland.
 Action to be taken
 Proxy Form
Ryanair Holdings PLC Notice of AGM
 You will find enclosed a Form of Proxy and Attendance Card for the Annual General Meeting.  Whether or 
not you wish to attend the Annual General Meeting you should complete and sign the Form of Proxy and 
return it by no later than 9.00 a.m. on September 23, 2014 to Capita Asset Services, Shareholder solutions 
(Ireland), P.O. Box 7117, Dublin 2, Ireland (Please see notes 4 and 5 attached). Completion and return of 
the Form of Proxy will not preclude you from attending and voting at the Annual General Meeting, should 
you wish to do so. If you wish to attend the Annual General Meeting in person please bring your Attendance 
Card with you. If you appoint a person other than the Chairman or any other officer of Ryanair Holdings 
plc as your proxy, please give your Attendance Card to that person for his/her admission to the Meeting.
 Business to be considered at the Annual General Meeting
 Your attention is drawn to the Notice of Meeting on pages 3 to 5, which sets out matters to be considered 
at the Annual General Meeting. The ordinary business to be transacted at the Annual General Meeting is set 
out in resolutions 1 to 5 in the Notice.
 Under Resolution 2, shareholders are being asked to consider the Remuneration Report contained in 
Ryanair's Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2014. This advisory and non-binding resolution is not 
mandatory and is often referred to as a "say on pay" resolution. While it is not mandatory for companies 
to put such a resolution to shareholders, it is best practice and Ryanair is committed to maintaining the 
highest standards of corporate governance.
 In Resolution 3 shareholders are being asked to approve the payment of a dividend of EUR0.375 per 
Ordinary Share. Having considered the Company's financial position, strategic objectives and prospects, 
the Board has recommended the payment of a dividend of EUR0.375 per Ordinary Share. If approved, the 
dividend will be paid between January and March 2015.
 Resolution 4 deals with the re-election of Directors. The Company's Articles of Association require that 
at least one third of the Directors shall retire by rotation at the AGM in every year. However, in 
compliance with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Directors will retire and 
present themselves for re-election by the shareholders. Biographical details of the Directors are found on 
pages 106 and 107 of the 2014 Annual Report.
 Special Business
 In addition to the ordinary business there are three Resolutions relating to special business.
 Resolution 6 - Directors' Authority to Allot Ordinary Shares
 The Directors are seeking to renew their authority to allot shares in the authorised but unissued share 
capital of the Company for the period up to September 24, 2019.
 Resolution 7 - Disapplication of Statutory Pre-emption Rights
 As was the case at previous years' Annual General Meetings, the Directors are seeking authority to allot 
Ordinary Shares without first offering them to existing shareholders in accordance with statutory pre-
emption rights where the Ordinary Shares are allotted:-
 (a)           On the exercise of any option in accordance with the provisions of the existing Ryanair 
Holdings plc Share Option Plans of 2000, 2003 and 2013;
 (b)           In connection with a rights issue; and
 (c)           Otherwise than in pursuance of (a) and (b) above, up to an aggregate nominal value of the 
greater of EUR439,287, or 5% of the then issued share capital of the Company.
 It is proposed to renew this authority for the period expiring fifteen months from the passing of this 
Resolution or, if earlier, on the day following the next Annual General Meeting of the Company.
 Resolution 8 - Authority to Repurchase Shares
 The Directors are seeking the authority to make market purchases and/or overseas market purchases (as 
defined by Section 212 of the Companies Act, 1990) of the Company's Ordinary Shares and American 
Depositary Shares (ADSs). Any ADSs repurchased will be converted to Ordinary Shares and cancelled as will 
Ordinary Shares repurchased, and the number of Ordinary Shares in issue will reduce accordingly.
 The maximum price at which Ordinary Shares traded on the Irish Stock Exchange or the London Stock 
Exchange could be repurchased would be the higher of (i) 5% above the average market value of the 
Company's Ordinary Shares on the trading venue where the shares are being repurchased for the five 
business days prior to the date of purchase; and (ii) the price stipulated by Article 5(1) of Commission 
Regulation (EC) of December 22, 2003 (No. 2273/2003), being the higher of the last independent trade and 
the highest current independent bid on the trading venue on which the shares are being repurchased. It is 
further proposed that the maximum price at which Ordinary Shares which underlie the Company's ADSs which 
are traded on NASDAQ could be repurchased would be 5% above the average market value of one-fifth of the 
Company's ADSs on NASDAQ for the five business days prior to the date of purchase (as one ADS represents 
five Ordinary Shares).
 The minimum price at which Ordinary Shares could be repurchased would be their nominal value of 0.635 
euro cents. The authority will also enable the Company to repurchase in US dollars or euro.
 Recommendation of Directors
 The Directors believe that the passing of the Resolutions set out in the Notice of Meeting is in the best 
interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and the Directors unanimously recommend that you 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Notice of AGM
vote in favour of such Resolutions as they intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings in 
Ordinary Shares which, as at the date of this letter, represent approximately 4.35% of the issued share 
capital of the Company.
 Yours sincerely,
 David Bonderman
 Chairman

 Ryanair Welcomes Court Decision to Refuse Passenger Compensation
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Monday, 6th October 2008)
 welcomed the decision of Simmern Court in Germany to dismiss a passenger's
 compensation claim after Ryanair was forced to cancel a flight due to unsafe
 weather conditions in Jerez in October last year.
The German court found that bad weather prevented Ryanair from landing safely
 and represented extraordinary circumstances which were beyond the control of the
 airline under EU261 regulations.
The passenger, who was seeking compensation of over EUR1,600 as a result of this
 forced cancellation, had his claim dismissed by Simmern Court.  The passenger
 must now settle all costs associated with the case, including Ryanair's costs.
Welcoming the finding, Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
"The decision of the court was in accordance with the provisions of EU261.  We
 understand that cancelled flights can be frustrating. However, we must always
 make decisions which prioritise the safety of our passengers, crew and aircraft.
"In this case bad weather made it unsafe to land at Jerez and we had no
Ryanair Holdings PLC Court Decision to Refuse Passenger Compensation
 alternative but to cancel the return flight.  We welcome this decision which
 clarifies the fact that EU261 compensation claims do not arise in cases where
 bad weather forces airlines to put passenger safety ahead of passenger
 convenience".

Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (9th August 04) reiterated its
guarantee that there would be NO fuel surchargesfor Ryanair passengers this
year, as BA announces a second round of even HIGHER fuel surcharges to
passengers.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
"Ryanair is committed to giving passengers Europe's lowest fares everyday. Our
pledge to consumers is clear and unambiguous - the fare you pay, is the fare you
pay. Every Ryanair passenger can rest assured that Ryanair guarantees no fuel
surcharges - not today, not tomorrow, not ever.
BA's first instinct last May was to penalise passengers with a fuel surcharge
instead of reducing costs to pay for higher oil prices, and today they're at it
Ryanair Holdings PLC GUARANTEES NO FUEL SURCHARGES
again, with a second round of even HIGHER fuel surcharges. It is wrong, unfair
and anti-consumer that passengers who have already purchased high priced BA
tickets, and paid a fuel surcharge now have to pay a second surcharge. BA are
nothing more than a bunch of price gougers, ripping off consumers with high
fares and surcharges.
At Ryanair we believe in low fares. That's why Ryanair is the UK's favourite
airline for UK/European travel."

 Transaction in own shares
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") has previously announced an intention to return capital to shareholders by 
way of a share buy-back programme to be conducted pursuant to irrevocable arrangements with its brokers, 
Citigroup Global Markets Limited ("Citi") and J&E Davy ("Davy"). The Company today announces that on 14 April 
2016 it purchased for cancellation a total of 368,000 ordinary shares of nominal value EUR0.006 each in the capital 
of the Company ("Ordinary Shares") and 395,255 Ordinary Shares underlying American Depositary Receipts.
 The Ordinary Shares repurchased have been repurchased at an average price of EUR13.2681 per Ordinary Share 
(high of EUR13.2722 and low of EUR13.2561) and the Ordinary Shares underlying American Depositary Receipts 
have been repurchased at an average price of $16.4450 (high of $16.5620 and low of $16.3480).
 In respect of this programme, which will operate until not later than 31 October 2016, Citi and Davy will make 
trading decisions in relation to Ryanair's Ordinary Shares and American Depositary Receipts repurchased under 
the buy-back programme independently of, and uninfluenced by, Ryanair.  Any such acquisitions will be effected 
within certain pre-set parameters, and in accordance with both Ryanair's general authority to repurchase Ordinary 
Shares and Ordinary Shares underlying American Depositary Receipts, and Chapter 9 of the Listing Rules of the 
Irish Stock Exchange.
 Following the cancellation of the Ordinary Shares repurchased the Company will have 1,282,605,980 Ordinary

 Subject to certain exceptions for short-term and hedged positions, the U.S. dollar amount of dividends received by 
an individual prior to January 1, 2013 with respect to the Ordinary Shares or ADRs will be subject to taxation at a 
maximum rate of 15% if the dividends are "qualified dividends." Dividends paid on the Ordinary Shares or ADRs will 
be treated as qualified dividends if (i) the issuer is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with 
the United States that the Internal Revenue Service has approved for the purposes of the qualified dividend rules 
and (ii) the Company was not, in the year prior to the year in which the dividend was paid, and is not, in the year in 
which the dividend is paid, a passive foreign investment company (a "PFIC"). The income tax treaty between 
Ireland and the United States has been approved for the purposes of the qualified dividend rules. Based on the 
Company's audited financial statements and relevant market data, the Company believes that it was not treated as 
a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to its 2011/12 taxable year. In addition, based on the 
Company's audited financial statements and its current expectations regarding the value and nature of its assets, 
the sources and nature of its income, and relevant market data, the Company does not anticipate becoming a PFIC 
for its 2012/13 taxable year.
 Under the U.S.-Ireland Income Tax Treaty currently in effect, in the event the Company were to pay any dividend, 
the tax credit attaching to the dividend (as used herein the "Tax Credit"; see "-Irish Tax Considerations") generally 
will be treated as a foreign income tax eligible for credit against such U.S. Holder's United States federal income tax 
liability, subject to generally applicable limitations and conditions. Any such dividend paid by the Company to such 
U.S. Holder will constitute income from sources outside the United States for foreign tax credit purposes, and 
generally will constitute "passive category" income for such purposes.
 Foreign tax credits may not be allowed for withholding taxes imposed in respect of certain short-term or hedged 
positions in securities.
 U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the implications of these rules in light of their 
particular circumstances.
 Distributions of Ordinary Shares that are made as part of a pro rata distribution to all stockholders generally will not 
be subject to U.S. federal income tax.
 Taxation of Capital Gains
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -56-
 Sale or Disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADRs. Gains or losses realized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or other 
disposition of ADRs generally will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as capital gains or losses, which 
generally will be long-term capital gains or losses if the ADRs have been held for more than one year. The net 
amount of long-term capital gain recognized by an individual holder before January 1, 2013 generally is subject to 
taxation at a maximum rate of 15%. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
 Deposits and withdrawals of Ordinary Shares by U.S. Holders in exchange for ADRs will not result in the realization 
of gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 Non-U.S. Holders. A holder of Ordinary Shares or ADRs that is, with respect to the United States, a foreign 
corporation or a nonresident alien individual (a "Non-U.S. Holder") generally will not be subject to U.S. federal 
income or withholding tax on dividends received on such Ordinary Shares or ADRs unless such income is 
effectively connected with the conduct by such holder of a trade or business in the United States. A Non-U.S. 
Holder of ADRs or Ordinary Shares will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax in respect of 
gain realized on the sale or other disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADRs, unless (i) such gain is effectively 
connected with the conduct by such holder of a trade or business in the United States or (ii) in the case of gain 
realized by an individual Non-U.S. Holder, such Non-U.S. Holder is present in the United States for 183 days or 
more in the taxable year of the sale and certain other conditions are met.

 Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
 GENERAL
 Ryanair is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and currency 
exchange rates. The objective of financial risk management at Ryanair is to minimize the negative impact of 
commodity price, interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the Company's earnings, cash flows and 
equity.
 To manage these risks, Ryanair uses various derivative financial instruments, including cross currency interest rate 
swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and commodity forwards. These derivative financial instruments are 
generally held to maturity and are not actively traded. The Company enters into these arrangements with the goal of 
hedging its operational and balance sheet risk. However, Ryanair's exposure to commodity price, interest rate and 
currency exchange rate fluctuations cannot be neutralized completely.
 In executing its risk management strategy, Ryanair currently enters into forward contracts for the purchase of some 
of the jet fuel (jet kerosene) that it expects to use. It also uses foreign currency forward contracts intended to reduce 
its exposure to risks related to foreign currencies, principally the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, it enters into interest rate 
contracts with the objective of fixing certain borrowing costs and hedging principal repayments, particularly those 
associated with the purchase of new Boeing 737-800s. Ryanair is also exposed to the risk that the counterparties to 
its derivative financial instruments may not be creditworthy. Were a counterparty to default on its obligations under 
any of the instruments described below, Ryanair's economic expectations when entering into these arrangements 
might not be achieved and its financial condition could be adversely affected. Transactions involving derivative 
financial instruments are also relatively illiquid as compared with those involving other kinds of financial instruments. 
It is Ryanair's policy not to enter into transactions involving financial derivatives for speculative purposes.
 The following paragraphs describe Ryanair's fuel hedging, foreign currency and interest rate swap arrangements 
and analyze the sensitivity of the market value, earnings and cash flows of the financial instruments to hypothetical 
changes in commodity prices, interest rates and exchange rates as if these changes had occurred at March 31, 
2012. The range of changes selected for this sensitivity analysis reflects Ryanair's view of the changes that are 
reasonably possible over a one-year period.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -56-
 FUEL PRICE EXPOSURE AND HEDGING
 Fuel costs constitute a substantial portion of Ryanair's operating expenses (approximately 43.0% and 39.1% of 
such expenses in fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively, after taking into account Ryanair's fuel hedging 
activities). Ryanair engages in fuel price hedging transactions from time to time, pursuant to which Ryanair and a 
counterparty agree to exchange payments equal to the difference between a fixed price for a given quantity of jet 
fuel and the market price for such quantity of jet fuel at a given date in the future, with Ryanair receiving the amount 
of any excess of such market price over such fixed price and paying to the counterparty the amount of any deficit of 
such fixed price under such market price.
 Ryanair has historically entered into arrangements providing for substantial protection against fluctuations in fuel 
prices, generally through forward contracts covering periods of up to 18 months of anticipated jet fuel requirements. 
Ryanair (like many other airlines) has, in more recent periods, entered into hedging arrangements on a much more 
selective basis. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-Changes in Fuel Costs 
and Fuel Availability Affect the Company's Results and Increases the Likelihood that the Company May Incur 
Losses" and "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks-Fuel Price Exposure and 
Hedging" for additional information on recent trends in fuel costs and the Company's related hedging activities, as 
well as certain associated risks. See also "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Fiscal Year 2012 
Compared with Fiscal Year 2011-Fuel and Oil." As of July 27, 2012, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet 
kerosene) contracts covering approximately 90% of its estimated requirements for the fiscal year ending March 31, 
2013 at prices equivalent to approximately $1,000 per metric ton. In addition, as of July 27, 2012, Ryanair had 
entered into forward jet fuel (jet kerosene) contracts covering approximately 50% of its estimated requirements for 
the first half of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2014 at prices equivalent to approximately $935 per metric ton, and 
had not entered into any jet fuel hedging contracts with respect to its expected fuel purchases beyond that period.

RYANAIR ANNOUNCES TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF OPERATIONS AT SEVEN BASES
Ryanair, Europe's leading low fares airline, today, Thursday, 17th July 2008,
announced the temporary closure of its operations at the following airports for
the period from Tuesday, 4th November until Friday, 19th December:
* Basel
* Budapest
* Krakow
* Palma
* Rzeszow
* Salzburg
* Valencia
Ryanair explained the decision to close its operations and cancel these flights
for the following reasons;
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Temporary Base Closures
* Costs at these airports are amongst the most expensive in Europe and far
outweigh the potential revenue which passengers are prepared to pay,
particularly during the off peak winter period.
* With oil at $140 a barrel, flights at expensive airports must be reduced this
winter when fares are very low.
Ryanair confirmed that it had written to the airports seeking a reduction on the
costs of these flights this winter but their response was wholly inadequate. The
loss of this passenger traffic will now cost the airport authority significant
commercial revenue and
Announcing this closure, Ryanair's Deputy Chief Executive, Michael Cawley, said;
"We very much regret temporarily closing our operations at these airports during
this November and December period. However, a combination of high airport
charges and the massive increases which we face in fuel prices, makes it more
profitable for Ryanair to ground aircraft rather than fly them at these airports
during this period.
"These flights the passengers would not be lost to these cities or tourism if
they had responded adequately to Ryanair's proposals for cost reductions on
these flights for the winter season.
"Ryanair, with the lowest costs and lowest guaranteed fares in Europe, is the
only airline capable of retaining year round international tourism and business
links for such regional cities. However, low airport costs and local support are
required to sustain these operations, particularly through the low yielding
months in the winter. In the absence of this support, Ryanair has no alternative
but to cancel these routes and develop its business elsewhere.
"We will continue our discussions with the airport authorities in order to
convince them that this type of interruption to our services need not happen in
the future if costs are reduced and hopefully we can develop an agreement on how
they can support the year round continuation of our services on a viable basis
for the benefit of the airports and the regions they serve".
The lost passenger traffic and numbers of flights is outlined as follows:

 Fuel and oil. Ryanair's fuel and oil costs per passenger increased by 13.2%, while in absolute terms, these costs 
increased by 18.3% from EUR1,593.6 million in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR1,884.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, in 
each case after giving effect to the Company's fuel hedging activities. The 18.3% increase reflected a 15% increase 
in average fuel prices paid and the impact of a 3.7% increase in the number of hours flown, which were offset in 
part by a 2.2% decrease in the average sector length. Fuel and oil costs include the direct cost of fuel, the cost of 
delivering fuel to the aircraft, aircraft de-icing and EU emissions trading costs. The average fuel price paid by 
Ryanair (calculated by dividing total fuel costs by the number of U.S. gallons of fuel consumed) increased 14.4% 
from EUR2.08 per U.S. gallon in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR2.38 per U.S. gallon in the 2013 fiscal year, in each 
case after giving effect to the Company's fuel hedging activities.
 Airport and handling charges and route charges. Ryanair's airport and handling charges per passenger increased 
5.6%, while route charges per passenger increased 1.1% in the 2013 fiscal year. In absolute terms, airport and 
handling charges increased 10.4%, from EUR554.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year, to EUR611.6 million in the 2013 
fiscal year, reflecting the overall growth in passenger volumes and higher charges at Dublin and London (Stansted) 
airports, partially offset by lower average costs at Ryanair's newer airports and bases. In absolute terms, route 
charges increased 5.7%, from EUR460.5 million in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR486.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, 
primarily as a result of the 4.7% increase in sectors flown.
 Staff costs. Ryanair's staff costs, which consist primarily of salaries, wages and benefits, increased 0.4% on a per-
passenger basis, while in absolute terms, these costs increased 5.0%, from EUR415.0 million in the 2013 fiscal 
year to EUR435.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year. The increase in absolute terms was primarily attributable to a 3.7% 
increase in hours flown and a flight crew pay increase of 2% granted in fiscal 2013.
 Depreciation. Ryanair's depreciation per passenger increased by 2.0%, while in absolute terms these costs 
increased 6.6% from EUR309.2 million in the 2012 fiscal year to EUR329.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year. The 
increase was primarily attributable to the addition of 11 owned aircraft to the fleet during the 2013 fiscal year. See "-
Critical Accounting Policies-Long-lived Assets" above.
 Marketing, distribution and other expenses. Ryanair's marketing, distribution and other operating expenses, 
including those applicable to the generation of ancillary revenues, increased 5.2% on a per-passenger basis in the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -41-
2013 fiscal year, while in absolute terms, these costs increased 9.9%, from EUR180.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year 
to EUR197.9 million in the 2013 fiscal year, with the overall increase primarily reflecting the higher level of activity 
and increased onboard product costs reflecting the higher level of sales.
 Maintenance, materials and repairs. Ryanair's maintenance, materials and repair expenses, which consist primarily 
of the cost of routine maintenance, provision for leased aircraft and the overhaul of spare parts, increased 11.0% on 
a per-passenger basis, while in absolute terms these expenses increased by 16.0% from EUR104.0 million in the 
2012 fiscal year to EUR120.7 million in the 2013 fiscal year. The increase in absolute terms during the fiscal year 
reflected the additional costs arising from increased level of activity and the opening of new bases.
 Aircraft rentals. Aircraft rental expenses amounted to EUR98.2 million in the 2013 fiscal year, an 8.2% increase 
from the EUR90.7 million reported in the 2012 fiscal year, reflecting the negative impact of higher lessor financing 
costs and the adverse impact of changes in the euro/dollar exchange rate on new leased aircraft and the handback 
of 4 aircraft due to the maturity of leases.
 Operating profit.  As a result of the factors outlined above, operating profit increased 0.6% on a per-passenger 
basis in the 2013 fiscal year, and also increased in absolute terms, from EUR683.2 million in the 2012 fiscal year to 
EUR718.2 million in the 2013 fiscal year.
 Finance expense. Ryanair's interest and similar charges decreased 9.0%, from EUR109.2 million in the 2012 fiscal 
year to EUR99.3 million in the 2013 fiscal year, primarily due to lower interest rates in the 2013 fiscal year 
compared to the 2012 fiscal year. These costs are expected to increase as Ryanair further expands its fleet.
 Finance income. Ryanair's interest and similar income decreased 38.2%, from EUR44.3 million in the 2012 fiscal 
year to EUR27.4 million in the 2013 fiscal year, reflecting the reduced yields on term deposits.
 Foreign exchange gains/losses. Ryanair recorded foreign exchange gains of EUR4.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, 
as compared with foreign exchange gains of EUR4.3 million in the 2012 fiscal year, with the different result being 
primarily due to the positive impact of changes in the U.K. pound sterling and the U.S. dollar exchange rates 
against the euro.
 Taxation. The effective tax rate for the 2013 fiscal year was 12.5%, as compared to an effective tax rate of 11.5% 
in the 2012 fiscal year. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory rate of Irish corporation tax of 12.5%. Ryanair 
recorded an income tax provision of EUR81.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year, compared with a tax provision of 
EUR72.6 million in the 2012 fiscal year, with the increase primarily reflecting higher pre-tax profits. The 
determination regarding the recoverability of the deferred tax asset was based on future income forecasts, which 
demonstrated that it was more likely than not that future profits would be available in order to utilize the deferred tax 
asset. A deferred tax asset's recoverability is not dependent on material improvements over historical levels of pre-
tax income, material changes in the present relationship between income reported for financial and tax purposes, or 
material asset sales or other non-routine transactions.
 SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS
 The Company's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management expects 
these variations to continue. Among the factors causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to 
general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Ryanair typically records higher revenues and 
income in the first half of each fiscal year ended March 31 than the second half of such year.
 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 Please see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 for information on recently issued 
accounting standards that are material to the Company.
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 Liquidity. The Company finances its working capital requirements through a combination of cash generated from 
operations, debt capital market issuances and bank loans for the acquisition of aircraft. See "Item 3. Key 
Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-The Company Will Incur Significant Costs Acquiring New 
Aircraft and Any Instability in the Credit and Capital Markets could Negatively Impact Ryanair's Ability to Obtain 
Financing on Acceptable Terms" for more information about risks relating to liquidity and capital resources. The 
Company had cash and liquid resources at March 31, 2014 and 2013 of EUR3,241.7 million and EUR3,559.0 
million, respectively. The decrease at March 31, 2014 primarily reflects cash generated from operating activities of 
EUR1,044.6 million, which was offset by the cash used to fund the purchase of 69.5 million Ordinary Shares via a 
share buy-back costing EUR481.7 million, as well as the purchase of property, plant, and equipment - primarily pre-
delivery payments on new Boeing 737-800 aircraft, spare engines and the repayment of EUR390.8 million of 
borrowings. Cash and liquid resources included EUR13.3 million and EUR24.7 million in "restricted cash" held on 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -41-
deposit as collateral for certain derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company with respect to its 
aircraft financing obligations and other banking arrangements at March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. See "Item 
8. Financial Information 3/4 Other Financial Information 3/4 Legal Proceedings."
 The Company's net cash inflows from operating activities in the 2014 and 2013 fiscal years amounted to 
EUR1,044.6 million and EUR1,023.5 million, respectively. The EUR21.1 million increase in net cash flows from 
operating activities for fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was principally due to a number of factors 
including an increase in accrued expenses. This movement,  which primarily relates to cash received in advance for 
flights, and receipt of other receivables and increases in other payables balances, generated EUR133.9 million in 
cash in 2014, compared with EUR67.4 million in 2013. This increase in net cash generated from working capital of 
EUR66.5 million, or approximately 98.7%, is primarily due to the an increase in cash receipts from advance 
bookings, some of which is due to the timing of Easter which fell in April 2014.
 During the last two fiscal years, Ryanair's primary cash requirements have been for operating expenses, additional 
aircraft, including advance payments in respect of new Boeing 737-800s and related flight equipment, payments on 
related indebtedness and payments of corporation tax, as well as share buy-backs of EUR549.2 million and the 
payment of a EUR491.5 million special dividend to shareholders. Cash generated from operations has been the 
principal source for these cash requirements, supplemented primarily by aircraft-related bank loans.

 NOTICE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING
 Ryanair Holdings plc ("Ryanair" or the "Company") announces  today (28 March) that it has published a circular to 
shareholders ("Circular") convening an extraordinary general meeting of the Company ("EGM"). The EGM will be 
held at 9.00 a.m. on 19 April, 2012 at The Radisson Blu Hotel, Dublin Airport, Co. Dublin, Ireland. A copy of the

available at:
 Company Announcements Office
 Irish Stock Exchange
 28 Anglesea Street
 Dublin
 Ireland; and at
 www.hemscott.com/nsm.do
 Two resolutions are proposed for consideration at the EGM. Resolution 1 is a proposal, (announced as part of the 
Company's Q3 Results issued on 30 January, 2012), to amend the Company's 5% share buy back authority in 
order to accommodate the possible repurchase of ordinary shares held in ADS form. Resolution 2 relates to the 
proposal by the Company to reclassify its listing on the Official List of the United Kingdom Listing Authority from a 
premium listing to a standard listing in order to facilitate such ADS repurchases. The Company's Ordinary Shares 
will continue to be traded on the main market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange and the Company 
will also retain its primary listing on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange which will ensure that all the current 
shareholder protections and corporate governance requirements remain applicable. Ryanair will also retain its

listing on NASDAQ, in ADS form (American Depositary Shares). It is not expected that this change in listing will 
have any impact on trading or liquidity in any of the three markets on which Ryanair securities are traded.
 Further information in relation to both Resolutions (which are inter-conditional) is contained in the Circular.
 The expected timetable of events is as follows:
Date of issue of the Circular                      28 March, 2012

 RYANAIR OPENS NEW EUROPEAN TRAINING CENTRE
 IN LONDON STANSTED
 1,000 NEW JOBS (450 IN THE UK) WILL BE CREATED IN 2016 AS RYANAIR INVESTS MORE THAN $1.4BN IN ITS 13 UK 
BASES
 CALLS FOR "REMAIN" VOTE ON 23RD JUNE TO ENCOURAGE FOREIGN INWARD INVESTMENT & JOB CREATION IN BRITAIN
 Ryanair, the UK's No. 1 airline today (16 May) opened its new European Training Centre in London Stansted 
Airport. Ryanair confirmed that it will create over 1,000 new jobs for pilots,       cabin crew, and 
engineers in 2016, more than 450 of which will be located at Ryanair's 13 UK airport bases to support its 
14 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft, an investment of over $1.4bn in the British economy. These new jobs will 
bring to more than 3,500 well paid aviation professionals that Ryanair employs directly in Britain, in 
addition to sustaining thousands of support jobs at Ryanair's 18 UK airports.
 Welcoming the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon George Osborne MP, to its new European Training 
Centre today, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary called for a strong "Remain" vote in the European Referendum 
on 23(rd) June next. Ryanair believes that Britain's economy will be stronger if it remains part of the 
European Union because:
 a)   This will lead to more UK jobs and stronger economic growth;
 b)   It will encourage more foreign inward investment in the UK of exactly the type that Ryanair has 
announced today;
 c)   The EU single market has created the low fare air travel revolution which has transformed UK tourism 
and jobs;
 d)   Prime Minister Cameron has negotiated significant reforms to protect Sterling, limit immigration, 
and prevent Britain from being dragged into closer Union while reducing bureaucracy for British 
businesses; and
 e)   UK foreign inward investment will be lost to competitor EU member states such as Ireland and Germany 
if Britain votes to leave the European Union.
 Speaking at London Stansted Airport, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "We are pleased to welcome Chancellor Osborne to open our new European Training Centre which now includes 
4 flight simulators, a full aircraft interior for cabin crew training, and an industry leading full scale 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR OPENS EUROPEAN TRAINING CENTRE IN STANSTED
engineering training aircraft. These new facilities will allow Ryanair to recruit and train over 1,000 
pilots, cabin crew and engineers in 2016, and many of these jobs will be based across Ryanair's 13 UK 
based airports, where we are adding 14 new aircraft, and growing our UK traffic from 36m passengers to 41m 
passengers in 2016.
 It is this type of large scale foreign inward investment that is helping to drive the UK economy and job 
creation. It is exactly this type of investment that will be lost to other competitor EU members if the UK 
votes to leave the European Union. The single market has enabled Ryanair to lead the low fare air travel 
revolution in Europe, as we bring millions of British citizens to Europe each year, and welcome millions 
of European visitors to Britain, and we are calling on everyone to turn out in large numbers and vote 
"Remain" on the 23(rd) June. I am absolutely certain that the UK economy is better off in Europe, and that 
is why Ryanair is campaigning hard and actively calling on UK voters to vote "Remain" on the 23(rd) June."
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne said:
 "Attracting the investment Britain needs from around the world in order to keep growing and creating good 
jobs here at home is key if we are to create lasting economic security for working people.
 That's why I'm delighted to be at Ryanair today to hear about their plans to create 450 new highly 
skilled jobs this year in the UK, and welcome their call for Britain to remain part of the European Union.
 Today's announcement is just another example of how British jobs and livelihoods directly benefit from 
being part of the European Union, thanks to the billions of pounds of foreign investment which flow more 
to Britain than any other European country. As Ryanair recognise, we're stronger, safer and better off in 
the European Union."
 Charlie Cornish, Chief Executive of MAG, owner of London Stansted Airport, said:
 "I'm delighted Ryanair has chosen London Stansted Airport as the base for its new training and 
engineering facilities, particularly at a time when both businesses are seeing significant growth.
 Together, London Stansted and Ryanair have been at the forefront of the European air travel revolution of 
the last 20 years. When Ryanair first started flying from London Stansted, passengers had a choice of just 
a dozen EU destinations but this morning they can choose from over 140 EU destinations, more than at any 
other UK airport. As competition has strengthened, airlines have become more efficient, air fares have 
fallen, and choice has increased. By opening up the European travel market to competition, the EU has done 
far more for British consumers and businesses than any government could ever have done acting on its own.
 London Stansted delivers more European visitors into London than any other airport, generating a 
significant economic boost to London's economy and UK PLC. Leaving the EU would undoubtedly be a huge 
backward step for UK aviation, a sector that employs around 1 million people and supports some of our most 
successful and innovative industries."

 The Company is Dependent on External Service Providers. Ryanair currently assigns its engine overhauls and 
"rotable" repairs to outside contractors approved under the terms of Part 145, the European regulatory standard for 
aircraft maintenance established by the European Aviation Safety Agency ("Part 145"). The Company also assigns 
its passenger, aircraft and ground handling services at airports other than Dublin and certain airports in Spain and 
the Canary Islands to established external service providers. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-
Maintenance 
and 
Repairs-Heavy 
Maintenance" 
and 
"Item 
4. 
Information 
on 
the 
Company-Airport 
Operations[3/4]Airport Handling Services."
 The termination or expiration of any of Ryanair's service contracts or any inability to renew them or negotiate 
replacement contracts with other service providers at comparable rates could have a material adverse effect on the 
Company's results of operations. Ryanair will need to enter into airport service agreements in any new markets it 
enters, and there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain the necessary facilities and services at 
competitive rates. In addition, although Ryanair seeks to monitor the performance of external parties that provide 
passenger and aircraft handling services, the efficiency, timeliness, and quality of contract performance by external 
providers are largely beyond Ryanair's direct control. Ryanair expects to be dependent on such outsourcing 
arrangements for the foreseeable future.
 The Company is Dependent on Key Personnel. The Company's success depends to a significant extent upon the 
efforts and abilities of its senior management team, including Michael O'Leary, the Chief Executive Officer, and key 
financial, commercial, operating and maintenance personnel. Mr. O'Leary's current contract may be terminated by 
either party upon 12 months' notice. See "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees-Compensation of 
Directors and Senior Management-Employment Agreements." The Company's success also depends on the ability 
of its executive officers and other members of senior management to operate and manage effectively, both 
independently and as a group. Although the Company's employment agreements with Mr. O'Leary and some of its 
other senior executives contain non-competition and non-disclosure provisions, there can be no assurance that 
these provisions will be enforceable in whole or in part. Competition for highly qualified personnel is intense, and 
either the loss of any executive officer, senior manager, or other key employee without adequate replacement or the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -18-
inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business, 
operating results, and financial condition.
 The Company Faces Risks Related to its Internet Reservations Operations and its Announced Elimination of 
Airport Check-in Facilities. Approximately 99% of Ryanair's flight reservations are made through its website. 
Although the Company has established a contingency program whereby the website is hosted in three separate 
locations, each of these locations accesses the same booking engine, located at a single center, in order to make 
reservations.
 A back-up booking engine is available to Ryanair to support its existing platform in the event of a breakdown in this 
facility. Nonetheless, the process of switching over to the back-up engine could take some time and there can be no 
assurance that Ryanair would not suffer a significant loss of reservations in the event of a major breakdown of its 
booking engine or other related systems, which, in turn, could have a material adverse affect on the Company's 
operating results or financial condition.
 Since October 1, 2009, all passengers have been required to use Internet check-in. Internet check-in is part of a 
package of measures intended to reduce check-in lines and passenger handling costs and pass on these savings 
by reducing passenger airfares. See "Item 4. Information on the Company-Reservations/Ryanair.com." The 
Company has deployed this system across its network. Any disruptions to the Internet check-in service as a result 
of a breakdown in the relevant computer systems or otherwise could have a material adverse impact on these 
service-improvement and cost-reduction efforts. The result of this requirement is that Ryanair has reduced airport 
and handling costs, as a result of the need to have fewer check-in personnel and rented check-in desks. There can 
be no assurance, however, that this process will continue to be successful or that consumers will not switch to other 
carriers that provide standard check-in facilities, which would negatively affect the Company's results of operations 
and financial condition.
 The Company Faces Risks Related to Unauthorized Use of Information from the Company's Website. 
Screenscraper websites gain unauthorized access to Ryanair's website and booking system, extract flight and 
pricing information and display it on their own websites for sale to customers at prices which include intermediary 
fees on top of Ryanair's fares. Ryanair does not allow any such commercial use of its website and objects to the 
practice of screenscraping also on the basis of certain legal principles, such as database rights, copyright 
protection, etc. The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings against the proprietors of screenscraper 
websites in Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy and Switzerland. The Company's objective is to 
prevent any unauthorized use of its website. The Company has received favorable rulings in Ireland, Germany and 
The Netherlands. However, pending the outcome of these legal proceedings and if Ryanair were to be unsuccessful 
in them, the activities of screenscraper websites could lead to a reduction in the number of customers who book 
directly on Ryanair's website and consequently in a reduction in the Company's ancillary revenue stream. Also, 
some customers may be lost to the Company once they are presented by a screenscraper website with a Ryanair 
fare inflated by the screenscraper's intermediary fee. This could also adversely affect Ryanair's reputation as a low-
fares airline, which could negatively affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. For 
additional details, see "Item 8. Financial Information-Other Financial Information-Legal Proceedings-Legal 
Proceedings Against Internet Ticket Touts."
 Irish Corporation Tax Rate Could Rise. The majority of Ryanair's profits are subject to Irish Corporation Tax at a 
statutory rate of 12.5%. Due to the size and scale of the Irish government's budgetary deficit and the recent 
"bailout" of the Irish government by a combination of loans from the International Monetary Fund and the European 
Union, there is a risk that the Irish government could increase Irish Corporation Tax rates above 12.5% in order to 
repay current or future loans or to increase tax revenues.
 At 12.5%, the rate of Irish Corporation Tax is lower than that applied by most of the other European Union member 
states, and has periodically been subject to critical comment by the governments of other EU member states. 
Although the Irish government has publicly stated that it will not increase Corporation Tax rates, there can be no 
assurance that such an increase in Corporation Tax rates will not occur.
 In the event that the Irish government increases Corporation Tax rates or changes the basis of calculation of 
Corporation Tax from the present basis, any such changes would result in Ryanair paying higher corporate taxes 
and would have an adverse impact on our cash flows, financial position and results of operations.
 Risks Related to the Airline Industry
 Volcanic Ash Emissions Could Affect the Company and Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company's Results 
of Operations. Between April 15 and April 20, 2010 and May 4 and May 17, 2010, a significant portion of the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -18-
airspace over northern Europe was closed by authorities as a result of safety concerns presented by emissions of 
ash from an Icelandic volcano. This closure forced Ryanair to cancel 9,490 flights. In May 2011, there were further 
periodic closures of parts of the European airspace due to emissions of ash from another Icelandic volcano, which 
resulted in the cancellation of 96 flights.
 Under the terms of Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004, described below, Ryanair has certain duties to passengers 
whose flights are cancelled. In particular, Ryanair is required to reimburse passengers who have had their flights 
cancelled for certain reasonable, documented expenses - primarily for accommodation and food. As of the date 
hereof, the Company is uncertain as to the number of claims it will receive or the amount it will have to reimburse 
passengers in respect of these claims, (as there is currently no time limitation on claims specified in the Regulation) 
but the Company expects that the amount will be significant. The Company estimates that the non-recoverable 
fixed costs associated with the cancellations, the repositioning costs for aircraft, and other costs associated with 
cancellations, as well as the aforementioned reimbursement claims for the initial 20 days of closure of European 
aerospace will amount to approximately EUR1.5 million per day, or approximately EUR29 million for such periods of 
closure. The Company has re-accommodated or refunded fares to approximately 1.5 million passengers due to 
flight cancellations.
 Volcanic emissions may happen again and could lead to further significant flight cancellation costs which could 
have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, 
volcanic emissions (whether from current or new sources) or similar atmospheric disturbances and resulting 
cancellations due to the closure of airports could also have a material adverse affect on the Company's financial 
performance indirectly, as a consequence of changes in the public's willingness to travel within Europe due to the 
risk of flight disruptions.

 During the 2006 fiscal year, Ryanair established Aviation Insurance (IOM) Limited ("AIL"), a wholly owned 
insurance company subsidiary, to provide the Company with self-insurance as part of its ongoing risk-management 
strategy. AIL underwrites a portion of the Company's aviation insurance program, which covers not only the 
Company's aircraft but also its liability to passengers and to third parties. AIL reinsures virtually all of the aviation 
insurance risk it underwrites with recognized third parties in the aviation reinsurance market, with the amount of 
AIL's maximum aggregate exposure not currently subject to such reinsurance agreements being equal to 
approximately $16.5 million. In addition to aviation insurance, AIL has underwritten most of the single trip travel 
insurance policies sold on Ryanair.com since February 1, 2011.
 Council Regulation (EC) No. 2027/97, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No. 889/2002, governs air carrier 
liability. This legislation provides for unlimited liability of an air carrier in the event of death or bodily injuries suffered 
by passengers, implementing the Warsaw Convention of 1929 for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to 
Transportation by Air, as amended by the Montreal Convention of 1999. Ryanair has extended its liability insurance 
to meet the appropriate requirements of the legislation. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to 
the Airline Industry-The Company Faces the Risk of Loss and Liability" for information on the Company's risks of 
loss and liability.

Ryanair has agreements with the DAA, the Irish government authority charged with operating Dublin Airport, 
to lease bag-drop counters and other space at the passenger and cargo terminal facilities at Dublin 
Airport. The airport office facilities used by Ryanair at London (Stansted) are leased from the airport 
authority; similar facilities at each of the other airports Ryanair serves are provided by Servisair plc 
or other service providers.
 TRADEMARKS
 Ryanair's logo and the slogans "Ryanair.com The Low Fares Website" and "Ryanair The Low Fares Airline" 
have been registered as Community Trade Marks ("CTMs"). Ryanair has also registered the CTM for the word 
"Ryanairhotels.com." A CTM allows a trademark owner to obtain a single registration of its trademark, 
which registration affords uniform protection for that trademark in all EU member states. The registration 
gives Ryanair an exclusive monopoly over the use of its trade name with regard to similar services and the 
right to sue for trademark infringement should another party use an identical or confusingly similar 
trademark in relation to identical, or similar services.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -30-
 Ryanair has not registered either its name or its logo as a trademark in Ireland, as CTM-registration 
provides all of the protection available from an Irish registration, and management believes there are 
therefore no advantages in making a separate Irish application.
 Ryanair's trademarks include:
 -       Community (Word) Trade Mark registration number 004168721 comprised of the word "Ryanair" in 
classes 16, 28, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 and 42 (Nice Classification);
 -       Community (Figurative) Trade Mark registration number 001493329 comprising the following graphic 
representation:
 in classes 16, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 and 42 (Nice Classification) and class 27.5.1 (Vienna classification);
 -       Community (Figurative) Trade Mark registration number 00446559 comprising the following graphic 
representation:
 in classes 16, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 and 42 (Nice Classification) and class 22.1.16 (Vienna classification);
 -       Community (Figurative) Trade Mark registration number 000338301
 comprising the following graphic representation:
 in classes 16, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 and 42 (Nice Classification) and class 22.1.16 (Vienna classification)
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 Liberalization of the EU Air Transportation Market
 Ryanair began its flight operations in 1985, during a decade in which the governments of Ireland and the 
U.K. liberalized the bilateral arrangements for the operation of air services between the two countries. 
In 1992, the Council of Ministers of the EU adopted a package of measures intended to liberalize the 
internal market for air transportation in the EU. The liberalization included measures that allow EU air 
carriers substantial freedom to set air fares, provided EU air carriers greatly enhanced access to routes 
within the EU, and also introduced a licensing procedure for EU air carriers. Beginning in April 1997, EU 
air carriers have generally been able to provide passenger services on domestic routes within any EU 
member state outside their home country of operations without restriction. See also "[3/4]Industry 
Overview[3/4]European Airline Market."
 Regulatory Authorities
 Ryanair is subject to Irish and EU regulation, which is implemented primarily by the Department of 
Transport, the IAA, the European Commission, and the EASA. Management believes that the present regulatory 
environment in Ireland and the EU is characterized by high sensitivity to safety and security issues, 
which is demonstrated by intensive reviews of safety-related procedures, training, and equipment by the 
national and EU regulatory authorities.
 Commission for Aviation Regulation. The CAR is currently primarily responsible for deciding maximum 
airport charges only at Dublin Airport. See "[3/4]Airport Operations[3/4]Airport Charges" above.
 The CAR also has responsibility for licensing Irish airlines, subject to the requirements of EU law. It 
issues operating licenses under the provisions of EU Regulation 1008/2008 (formerly 2407/92). An operating 
license is an authorization permitting the holder to transport passengers, mail and/or cargo by air. The 
criteria for granting an operating license include, inter alia, an air carrier's financial fitness, the 
adequacy of its insurance, and the fitness of the persons who will manage the air carrier. In addition, in 
order to obtain and maintain an operating license, Irish and EU regulations require that (i) the air 
carrier must be owned and continue to be owned directly or through majority ownership by EU member states 
and/or nationals of EU member states and (ii) the air carrier must at all times be effectively controlled 
by such EU member states or EU nationals. The CAR has broad authority to revoke an operating license. See 
"Item 10. Additional Information--Limitations on Share Ownership by Non-EU Nationals." See also "Item 3.

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES MORE ROUTE AND FLIGHT CUTS AT DUBLIN AS GOVT OWNED IAA RAISES
 FEES 12%
Ryanair, Ireland's largest airline, today (16th Mar 09) announced a further
 series of route, flight and frequency cuts at Dublin Airport from July, as the
 impact of the EUR10 tourist tax and other Government price hikes cause numbers at
 Dublin to decline - down 12% in February alone.  Ryanair confirmed that these
 latest cuts were being implemented in response to the decision of the Government
 owned Irish Aviation Authority to increase ATC charges by 12% this summer, at
 more than 12 times the rate of inflation.
From July 2009 Ryanair will close four routes from Dublin to Basel, Doncaster,
 Oporto and Teesside, and reduce frequencies on eight more routes from Dublin to
 Aberdeen, Biarritz, Billund, Bournemouth, Carcassonne, East Midlands, Malaga and
 Rome (Ciampino). These cuts will result in one additional based aircraft (five
 in total) being switched from high cost Dublin Airport to a low cost Ryanair
 European base in July.
Ryanair's latest cuts at Dublin for summer 2009 will see:
*  A 22% cut in Dublin based aircraft (from 22 to 17).
Ryanair Holdings PLC Route And Flight Cuts At Dublin Airport
 *  A 20% cut in weekly rotations (from over 700 to under 600).
 *  A 23% drop in Ryanair's Dublin traffic (10.8m to 8.3m pax in 2009/10).
 *  The loss of 50 Dublin based jobs (250 in total).
 *  Further cuts in Ryanair's Dublin winter schedule will be announced later.
Announcing these further Dublin cuts today, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"This latest 12% increase in Government owned ATC charges at Dublin Airport is
 another nail in the coffin of Irish tourism.  These increases have been
 rubber-stamped yet again by Ireland's useless Aviation Regulator, Cathal
 Guiomard, proving again how useless he is and that he should be sacked. How can
 any regulator approve a 12% increase in ATC charges in a year when inflation
 will be negative?  This is impossible to justify.
"These IAA increases show that this gutless Government has no interest in Irish
 tourism.  Over the last three months traffic at Dublin Airport has declined by
 12%, with 500,000 fewer passengers, and this collapse will get worse from April
 when the Government EUR10 travel tax and these IAA increases come in.
"These massive Government cost increases prove that this Government is
 devastating the tourism industry. Already this year the DAA has increased
 airport charges, increased wheelchair charges, is double charging for kiosk
 installation and now the Government and its clueless Regulator allows the IAA to
 raise ATC charges by 12%, when inflation is at 0%.
"At a time when Governments and airports all over Europe are reducing costs in
 order to stimulate tourism, the Irish Government is raising costs and
 introducing taxes which can only damage tourism. Ryanair calls again on the
 Irish Government to promote tourism by scrapping the travel tax and sacking
 Cathal Guiomard, the useless and incompetent Aviation Regulator."

         recent addition of Bristol and Nantes.
        "The partnership between Shannon Airport Authority and Ryanair, based on
         low fares and rapid traffic growth has been an outstanding success and
         has been a major driver of business and tourism in the West of Ireland.
         "To celebrate we are offering 2,000 FREE* seats on our Shannon - Malaga
         route available today on www.ryanair.com. This route will prove very

         low fare access to the West of Ireland".

 RYANAIR REPORTS FULL YEAR NET PROFIT OF EUR523M
 TRAFFIC GROWS 3% TO 81.7M - LOAD FACTOR UP 1% TO 83%
 Ryanair, Europe's biggest low fares airline today (May 19) announced full year net profit of EUR523m, slightly 
ahead of previous guidance.  Traffic grew 3% to 81.7m passengers.  Revenue per passenger was flat, as strong 
ancillary revenue growth offset a 4% fall in average fares.  Excluding fuel, sector length adjusted unit costs fell by 
3%.

"Ryanair's, Michael O'Leary, said:
 The highlights of the past financial year include:-
 --    Customer experience improving rapidly.
 --    New website launched with "fare finder" facility.
 --    121 new routes.
 --    8 new bases - Athens, Thessaloniki, Brussels, Lisbon, Rome (FCO), Catania, Lamezia & Palermo.
 --    180 new aircraft ordered, delivery 2014 to 2018.
 --    Fares launched on GDS (Galileo & Worldspan) and Google flight search.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
 --    Net profit of EUR523m despite a 4% fall in avg fares.
 --    EUR482m share buyback completed.
 While disappointing that profits fell 8% to EUR523m due mainly to a 4% decline in fares, weaker sterling, 
and higher fuel costs, we reacted quickly to this weaker environment last September by lowering fares and 
improving our customer experience which caused H2 traffic to grow 4% as load factors rose 1%.  Ancillary 
revenues grew 17%, much faster than traffic growth, and now accounts for 25% of total revenues.
 New Routes and Bases
 Forward bookings for Summer 14 are significantly ahead of last year, since we began offering lower fares 
and released our seasonal schedules earlier, and this should continue to deliver 2% higher load factors, 
and help us manage fares closer to departure as we have less capacity to sell.
 We recently opened 4 new bases at Athens, Brussels, Lisbon and Rome.  These are performing ahead of 
expectation as customers switch from high fare carriers to Ryanair's lower fares and industry leading 
customer service.  We announced 3 new bases for winter 2014 in Cologne, Gdansk, and Warsaw.  We released 
our winter 2014 schedule 3 months earlier than last year, offering our customers lower fares much earlier 
than our competitors, while we focus on building frequency and capacity on key business city pairs. We 
expect these new bases will provide significant growth opportunities as we start deliveries (Sept 2014) of 
our new Boeing 737-800 NG aircraft order.
 Customer Experience Improvement
 We have worked hard over the last 6 months to improve customer experience and enhance our industry 
leading service (lowest fares, most on-time flights, the youngest fleet). These initiatives include, (i) 
allocated seating (ii) a simpler, easier to use, website with a brilliant "fare finder" facility, (iii) 
free small 2(nd) carry-on bag, (iv) "quiet flights" (v) a 24 hour "grace period" to correct minor booking 
errors, (vi) reduced boarding card and airport bag fees, and (vii) a new service to cater for groups and 
corporate travellers.  Our new family product will launch in June and will allow children (when travelling 
with their family) to receive discounts on allocated seats and bags, while families who travel frequently 
with Ryanair can qualify for discounts on future flights.  In the autumn we will launch a business service 
in conjunction with our frequency build on key business routes which will include, same day flight 
changes, bigger bag allowances, premium seat allocation, mobile boarding pass, and fast-track through 
security at many Ryanair airports. This service, together with our new GDS distribution strategy, will 
make Ryanair much more accessible and easier to use for business customers.
 Digital & Distribution Improvements
 Our new digital strategy began to roll out last November with a much easier to use website, cutting the 
booking process from 17 to 5 "clicks".  More recently we unveiled a new website with "fare finder" which 
enables customers to easily find our lowest fares, share these fares with their friends and book them 
quickly. The "My Ryanair" registration service has been welcomed by customers with over 2m already 
registered.  We will continue to invest in web and digital improvements over the coming year, as we 
deliver an industry leading mobile app (tailored for smart phones and tablets) by mid-summer, and improve 
our digital marketing and CRM services for the benefit of all our customers.
 In April, we began extensive TV and outdoor advertising in major EU markets to promote our new website 
and recent customer experience improvements.  These campaigns will continue through the year, as our 
marketing and advertising spend rises to approx. EUR35m (from just EUR10m last year), although this spend 
is still less than EUR0.50 per passenger.
 We have broadened our distribution by becoming the first low fares airline in Europe to partner with 
Google's "Flight Search" function, which is now available in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Holland, 
Ireland, Poland and Spain (and more countries follow shortly). This partnership enables consumers to 
easily access and book Ryanair's lower fares every time they search on Google.  In April we began 
distribution on Galileo and Worldspan GDS systems, which allows travel and corporate agents to see and 
book Ryanair's low fares.  We are in talks with other GDS's (to broaden our distribution base) and hope to 
add more before year end.  Our new Groups and Corporate travel service launched in January and take up of 
these services is growing rapidly.
 Fuel
 We are 90% hedged for FY15 at a cost of $960 per tonne (approx. $96 p.bl).  This will generate net 
savings of approx. EUR70m compared to FY14.  In light of recent oil price and US$ weakness we have hedged 
approx. 13% of our FY16 fuel (at approx. $94 per barrel), and have also hedged our dollar requirements 
which will deliver further savings of up to 4% per passenger, in Euro terms, in FY 2016.
 Balance Sheet
 Our balance sheet remains among the strongest in the industry and was a key factor in S&P and Fitch 
recently awarding BBB+ ratings to Ryanair, making us the highest rated airline in the world.  During FY14 
we completed EUR482m of share buybacks, well ahead of our original EUR400m target.  We remain committed to 
returning a further EUR500m to shareholders in Q4 via a special dividend subject to AGM approval. This 
will bring the total returns to Ryanair shareholders since 2008 to over EUR2.5bn. Our business model 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
remains strongly cash generative and year end cash amounted to EUR3.2bn (net cash of EUR158m), despite 
EUR482m in buybacks, debt repayments of EUR391m, and capex of EUR506m during the year.
 Outlook.
 We expect FY15 traffic to grow by 4% to over 84.6m as load factors increase 2% to 85% and we add some 
limited new route and capacity growth.  Most of this growth will be skewed towards H2 as we reduce our 
winter grounding from 70 aircraft in FY14 to approx. 50 in FY15.  While fares fell by 4% in FY14 we expect 
FY15 fares to rise by up to 2%.   H1 fares will rise by up to 6% due in part to Easter, stable growth in 
Q2, and stronger forward bookings and load factors.  However we remain very cautious about H2 guidance 
(especially following last winter's weak price environment) where we are committed to 6% capacity growth 
which could cause H2 fares to fall by as much as 6% to 8%.
 Unit costs for FY15 will be flat.  Fuel costs (which includes de-icing) will be EUR70m lower than last 
year as we are 90% hedged, but we expect de-icing costs to rise from last year's unusually mild winter.  
Excluding fuel unit costs will rise by approx. 5% reflecting pay increases, primary airport charges, a 
EUR25m rise in advertising and marketing, and ownership cost increases due to summer lease ins and new 
aircraft deliveries from September onwards.
 In conclusion, we expect this combination of a strong H1, but a weaker H2 will generate a significant 
rise in after tax profits to a range of between EUR580m to EUR620m, although this guidance is heavily 
qualified by H2 yield outturn, over which we currently have zero visibility.

                   2M FREE* SEATS ALL OVER EUROPE TO CELEBRATE
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today (Friday, 11th November 2005)
announced a $1 billion multi year expansion plan for its base at Frankfurt Hahn.
By 2012, Ryanair will have 18 based aircraft, operate over 50 routes, carry 8
million passengers p.a. and have created over 8,000 jobs at Frankfurt Hahn
airport. With this enormous investment Frankfurt Hahn will overtake Dublin to
become Ryanair's second largest airport base and become Germany's fastest
growing and 8th largest airport.
Announcing this major expansion in Mainz, the capital of Rhineland Palatinate,
today, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO said:
    "Between 2006 and 2012, Ryanair is committed to an investment of $1 billion
     in new aircraft at Frankfurt Hahn. With over 50 routes, 8 million passengers
Ryanair Holdings PLC $1B investmentFrankfurt Hahn
     and 8,000 jobs this is the single biggest investment in German aviation by a
     non German company and will make Frankfurt Hahn one of the largest airports
     in Germany and Germany's fastest growing airport.
    "Ryanair will also provide a loan of EUR12.5 million in respect of 50% of the
     total capital expenditure on the new passenger terminal at Frankfurt Hahn
     and will also locate a Ryanair maintenance facility at the airport.
     "I wish to acknowledge the contribution of Fraport and the government of
     Rhineland Palatinate to this project. Ryanair's successful collaboration
     with these partners since 1999 has helped to transform the airport into a
     major stimulant for tourism and employment in the States economy. Today's
     announcement ensures that this growth will be taken a significant stage
     further. Over the next 7 years Ryanair looks forward to creating 8,000 jobs
     at Frankfurt Hahn, more than doubling passenger numbers and delivering the
     highest traffic growth and lowest fares in Germany".

15 July 2008
RYANAIR ANNOUNCES 18% SCHEDULE REDUCTIONS AT DUBLIN FOR WINTER'08/'09
Tuesday, 15th July 2008: Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today
announced substantial capacity reductions at its Dublin base for the coming
winter schedule (08/09). Compared to winter 2007, when Ryanair operated 22
aircraft, and over 1,350 weekly flights, Ryanair's schedule at Dublin this
winter will be reduced to 18 based aircraft and less than 1,200 weekly flights.
This represents an 18% reduction in based aircraft, and an approximate 12%
reduction in weekly flights. Ryanair estimates that its traffic at
Dublin Airport this winter will decline by some 500,000 passengers compared to
last winter's schedule.
Ryanair's decision to cut back based aircraft numbers and flights at
Dublin Airport is for the following reasons:
* Dublin is the second most expensive of Ryanair's base airports.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Schedule Reductions At Dublin
* Costs at the DAA monopoly continue to increase at multiples of the present rate
of inflation.
* The Aviation Regulator continues to rubber stamp unjustified Dublin Airport cost
increases including a recent 50% increase in check-in desks and a new (double)
charge for check-in desks kiosks.
* With oil at $140 a barrel, flights at high cost/expensive airports like Dublin
must be reduced this winter when fares are very low.
Ryanair confirmed that it had written to Dublin Airport seeking a reduction in
the costs of these flights this winter, but this offer has been dismissed by the
DAA monopoly. This is a further example of the DAA monopoly's disregard for the
needs and requirements of its airline customers. Ryanair estimates that this
cutback in winter capacity will result in almost 500,000 fewer passengers using
Dublin Airport this winter. However by eliminating this traffic - which Dublin
Airport charges up to EUR15 per departing passenger (more than the total air fare
in many cases), Ryanair will minimise its losses at Dublin Airport this winter.
At a time when many other European airports are building low cost facilities and
reducing their charges, the Dublin Airport monopoly is wasting hundreds of
millions of euro on inefficient facilities, and the useless Aviation Regulator
is rubber-stamping most of the cost increases they seek. Last week's radar
system failures at Dublin Airport was just the latest indication that the
regulated Dublin Airport monopoly, and the regulated IAA monopoly are not
delivering what airport users want or need at Dublin Airport. The sooner
Ireland's useless Aviation Regulator is dismissed and replaced with competing
facilities, the better.
Speaking today on the Dublin schedule reductions planned for Winter '08/'09,
Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
"We regret this significant capacity reduction at Dublin Airport this winter. It
will be the first time for many years that Ryanair has reduced capacity at
Dublin Airport. However, the combination of Dublin's high costs (second most
expensive base Ryanair operates to), unjustified cost increases (up 40% in the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Schedule Reductions At Dublin
last 4 years) and a hopeless Aviation Regulator who has most recently
rubberstamped doubling charging for check-in desks and check-in kiosks, makes it
more profitable for Ryanair to ground these aircraft rather than fly them at
Dublin Airport this Winter.
"These flights and 500,000 passengers would not be lost to Dublin or Irish
tourism if the DAA monopoly had responded to Ryanair's proposals for discounts
on these flights for the winter season. Like all monopolies the DAA has no
concern for its customers which is why Ryanair's offers were dismissed out of
hand.
"If a competing second terminal was being built at Dublin Airport, as Seamus
Brennan had proposed some years ago, airport charges at Dublin Airport would be
falling and facilities would be improving. Instead we have a Government-owned
airport monopoly wasting money building facilities that the airlines don't want,
and imposing massive cost increases at a time when fares are falling and oil
prices have doubled to all-time highs.
"I have little doubt that Ireland and its tourism industry is facing a
catastrophe over the coming year. Traffic growth at Dublin will be ended by this
combination of a rapacious Government monopoly, and an inadequate, useless
Aviation Regulator. The sooner both of these are done away with and replaced
with competing facilities at Dublin Airport, then the sooner Dublin can return
to traffic growth, lower costs and more efficient passenger friendly
facilities".

 As a result traffic in H2 will now rise by 16% or 5.3m customers (2.2m more than previously guided) although we 
still expect H2 fares to fall. With reasonable visibility in Q3 we expect traffic will grow 12%, while ave. fares will fall 
between -3% to -5% (slightly better than our previous -6% to -8% guidance).  In Q4, we plan to grow traffic by 20%, 
and expect fares will fall by -6% to -10%, (as we use lower fares to achieve our significantly higher traffic targets).  
Accordingly, we now expect full year traffic will grow by 9% to 89m customers, and ave. fares for FY15 to rise by 
just 1% to EUR47.  Unit costs (excluding fuel) will be positively impacted by this significant H2 traffic increase, and 
we now expect unit costs will be flat for FY15.  Including fuel, unit costs will fall 4% in FY15.
 As a result of these 2.2m additional H2 passengers and falling unit costs our full year net profit will significantly 
exceed our previous guidance (of EUR650m) to a new range of between EUR750m to EUR770m.  However, we 
caution that this raised guidance remains heavily reliant on the strength of close in bookings for the remainder of 
Q3, and in particular Q4 where we presently have very little visibility.
 While encouraged by the continuing strength of forward bookings, we would caution that close in bookings for the 
remainder of this winter will be subject to unforeseen events which always overhang our business, and so extreme 
caution rather than irrational exuberance should underpin any medium term forecasts.  As these strong H1 results 
and raised full year guidance demonstrate, our business model is performing well but much work remains to be 
done over the next 12 months to continue to develop and improve our "Always Getting Better" programme for the 
benefit of our customers, our people, and our shareholders".

Certain of the information included in this release is forward looking and is subject to important risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  It is not reasonably possible to itemise all of the 
many factors and specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an airline operating in the European 
economy.  Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results 
are the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -2-
replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., 
European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, weather related 
disruptions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour relations, 
the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the UK and 
Continental Europe, the general willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social and political 
factors.
 Ryanair is Europe's favourite airline, operating more than 1,600 daily flights from 70 bases, connecting 186 
destinations in 30 countries and operating a fleet of more than 300 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Ryanair has 
recently announced firm orders for a further 280 new Boeing 737 aircraft, as well as options for 100 more Boeing 
737 MAX 200s, which will enable Ryanair to lower fares and grow traffic from 89m this year to over 150m p.a. in 
2024. Ryanair currently has a team of more than 9,500 highly skilled aviation professionals, and has an industry 
leading 30-year safety record.

Ryanair Holdings PLC
22 March 2007
                 RYANAIR WELCOMES OPENSKIES - IT'S ABOUT TIME!
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Thursday, 22nd March 2007)
welcomed the introduction of Open Skies between the EU and the US. As Ryanair
has successfully proved in Europe, the liberalisation of air transport delivers
increased competition, better choice and lower airfares for consumers.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications Peter Sherrard said:
        "Ryanair welcomes this Open Skies agreement because Irish passengers
         will now enjoy greater choice and lower airfares on transatlantic
         routes. For years, prices have been too high on these routes because of
         Government controlled bi-lateral agreements.
        "Ryanair calls on the EU to use this opportunity to apply the benefits
         of deregulation to airports too. In Ireland, consumers are still paying

    RYANAIR ANNOUNCES BIGGEST EVER SKI PROGRAMME FLY TO THE SLOPES FOR FREE*
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Wednesday, 8th August 2007)
unveiled its biggest ever ski programme. With 58 direct routes from the UK to
European ski airports, Ryanair is leading the way to the mountains, with more
choice than any other airline.
Millions of skiers and boarders are set to benefit from the guaranteed lowest
fares to the slopes, as Ryanair unveiled a vast range of ski flights direct from
London, Glasgow, Liverpool, East Midlands, Bristol, Bournemouth, Newcastle,
Blackpool and Doncaster.
Announcing the record-breaking ski season, Ryanair's Head of Sales & Marketing,
Sinead Finn remarked;
"Ryanair offers the most choice and the lowest fares to the slopes. Each year,
skiers flock to Ryanair due to our guaranteed lowest fares and the convenience
Ryanair Holdings PLC BIGGEST EVER SKI PROGRAMME
of our airports.
"With flights from all over the UK to ski gateways such as Grenoble, Salzburg,
Friedrichshafen, Turin, Milan and Barcelona, it's never been easier to go skiing
or snowboarding.
"Our gateway airports are convenient and situated for easy access to the resorts
that skiers want to go to. Getting to famous French resorts such as Val D'Isere,
Meribel and Courcheval is so simple from Grenoble. And Friedrichshafen offers
the fastest access to Swiss and Austrian mega-resorts like Davos, Klosters and
St Anton."
"We recognise the unprecedented demand for ski flights from the UK, which is why
we've got more destinations served from more UK airports than ever before."
"To celebrate Ryanair's biggest ever ski season, we've made our ski flights
available for free*. But fares this low are certain to go fast, so we'd urge
skiers and boarders looking for the cheapest way to the pistes to book straight
away."
Full details of this winter schedule are available at www.ryanair.com.

 Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information
 Except for the historical statements and discussions contained herein, statements contained in this 
report constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the U.S. Securities 
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Forward-looking statements may include words such as "expect," 
"estimate," "project," "anticipate," "should," "intend," and similar expressions or variations on such 
expressions. Any filing made by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") 
may include forward-looking statements. In addition, other written or oral statements which constitute 
forward-looking statements have been made and may in the future be made by or on behalf of the Company, 
including statements concerning its future operating and financial performance, the Company's share of new 
and existing markets, general industry and economic trends and the Company's performance relative thereto 
and the Company's expectations as to requirements for capital expenditures and regulatory matters. The 
Company's business is to provide a low-fares airline service in Europe, and its outlook is predominately 
based on its interpretation of what it considers to be the key economic factors affecting that business 
and the European economy. Forward-looking statements with regard to the Company's business rely on a 
number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties and other 
factors, many of which are outside the Company's control, that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from such statements. It is not reasonably possible to itemize all of the many factors and 
specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an airline operating in the European economy. 
Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results are 
the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for 
replacement aircraft and aircraft maintenance services, aircraft availability, costs associated with 
environmental, safety and security measures, terrorist attacks, actions of the Irish, U.K., EU and other 
governments and their respective regulatory agencies, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest 
rates, changes to the structure of the euro, airport handling and access charges, litigation, labor 
relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, 
the U.K. and elsewhere in Europe, the general willingness of passengers to travel, flight interruptions 
caused by volcanic ash emissions or other atmospheric disruptions, factors affecting the value of 
Ryanair's investment in Aer Lingus Group plc and other factors discussed herein. The Company disclaims any 
obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, 
future events or otherwise.

EUR0.006 each (the "Shares") underlying American Depositary Shares ("ADS"), during the period commencing

regulations of the Irish Stock Exchange and where relevant, those provisions of Market Abuse Regulation 
596/2014/EU dealing with buy-back programmes and Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934. Citigroup and/or Davy may be undertaking transactions in the Shares (which may include 
participation in block purchases) during this period in order to meet their respective obligations 
pursuant to this buy-back.
 The maximum consideration payable by the Company in respect of repurchases of Shares underlying ADS under 
these arrangements is up to EUR150 million. The timing and the actual number of Shares repurchased will be 
dependent on market conditions, legal and regulatory requirements and the other terms and limitations 
contained in the plans.

           MALTA NEEDS MORE LOW FARE ROUTES TO UNLOCK FULL POTENTIAL
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Wednesday, 19th September
2007) announced a new route from Malta to Venice Treviso, its 8th new route
since bringing low fares to Malta in October last year. Since then Ryanair has
delivered on its commitment to growth, generating a 12% increase in passengers
flying to / from Malta this summer. With the addition of today's route, Ryanair
will deliver 300,000 passengers to / from Malta over the next 12 months,
generating a visitor spend of EUR63m and supporting 300 local jobs.
Welcoming today's new route, Ryanair's Deputy CEO, Michael Cawley said:
       "Ryanair low fares have generated unprecedented growth for Malta and
        demonstrated that while others talk, we deliver. However, this growth is
        just touching the surface of what could be achieved by opening many more
        low fare routes. We hope the Maltese Government will now take the
        initiative and unlock the island's true tourism potential by supporting
        the rapid development of low fare routes for the benefit of the island,

Ryanair Holdings PLC
31 May 2007
                       RYANAIR LAUNCHES 8 NEW ROUTES FROM SHANNON
    BIRMINGHAM, DUBLIN, FUERTEVENTURA, KAUNAS, LEEDS, LUTON, RIGA & TENERIFE
        Ryanair, Ireland's National airline, today (Thursday, 31st May 2007)
         announced eight new routes from its Shannon base to Birmingham, Dublin,
         Fuerteventura (Canaries), Kaunas, Luton, Leeds, Riga and Tenerife, which
         will start in November. From November, Ryanair will also increase the
         frequency of its Edinburgh (to daily) and Manchester (to 6 weekly)
         services. This expansion includes Ryanair's first domestic route from
         Shannon to Dublin and brings the number of destinations offered from the
         airport to 31.
        Announcing these new routes, Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
            "With Ryanair's latest expansion at Shannon, 1.7m passengers
             annually will enjoy Ireland's lowest fares guaranteed. This will
             deliver a visitor spend of EUR250m and support 1,700 jobs in the West.
             In the space of just 2 years, Ryanair has delivered dramatic tourism
             and economic growth for Shannon and the West as promised.
            "Shannon is now accessible from Galway in just over 1 hour thanks to
             the new Ennis by-pass, making Ryanair's 31 low fare routes at
             Shannon the low fare reference point for the whole of the West of
             Ireland. We look forward to delivering significant economic benefits
             for Galway and Connemara with these additional passenger numbers.
            "Our new, twice daily commuter route to Dublin will allow people
             from the West to fly day returns from Shannon and avoid the M50
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR LAUNCHES 8 NEW ROUTES
             traffic chaos for less than the price of half a tank of petrol.
            "To celebrate these 8 new routes, we have slashed EUR20 off all return
             flights and we urge passengers to book these lowest fares today on
             www.ryanair.com, as these bargains will sell out quickly".
In welcoming these new routes, Martin Moroney, Director, Shannon Airport, said:
            "We are delighted to see further expansion of Ryanair's operations,
             particularly the inclusion of Dublin in its route network, offering
             a daily return service. Galway is an important part of our catchment
             area for both inbound and outbound traffic, and we look forward to
             working with the tourism and business sector in harnessing support
             for these new services. Ryanair now carries over 50% of the terminal
             passenger traffic at Shannon airport and we look forward to working
             with them in the future as we expand our business".
Niall Gibbons, Director, Corporate Services, Tourism Ireland added:
            "Tourism Ireland, the organisation responsible for marketing the
             island of Ireland overseas, has warmly welcomed the announcement of
             the expansion of Ryanair services from Britain and Mainland Europe
             into Shannon Airport. Both markets were key drivers behind the
             record visitor numbers to Ireland last year so it augurs well for
             the season ahead. This expansion of services will make it even
             easier for visitors from these important markets to explore the many
             attractions on offer in the Shannon region".
    Route                     Starts            Frequency
    Birmingham                Nov               1 x Daily

         Lodz and Rome while Biarritz, Carcassonne, Milan, Murcia, Nantes and
         Venice will operate on a summer only basis (Apr - Oct) to accommodate
         these 8 new routes.

 Aircraft rentals. Aircraft rental expenses amounted to EUR90.7 million in the 2012 fiscal year, a 6.7% decrease 
from the EUR97.2 million reported in the 2011 fiscal year, reflecting the lower lease costs on newer aircraft and the 
handback of 3 aircraft due to the maturity of leases.
 Route charges and airport and handling charges. Ryanair's route charges per ASM decreased 0.1% in the 2012 
fiscal year, while airport and handling charges per ASM increased 0.3%. In absolute terms, route charges increased 
12.2%, from EUR410.6 million in the 2011 fiscal year to EUR460.5 million in the 2012 fiscal year, primarily as a 
result of the 5.8% increase in sectors flown. In absolute terms, airport and handling charges increased 12.6%, from 
EUR491.8 million in the 2011 fiscal year, to EUR554.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year, reflecting the overall growth in 
passenger volumes and higher charges at Dublin and Stansted airports, partially offset by lower average costs at 
Ryanair's newer airports and bases.
 Marketing, distribution and other expenses. Ryanair's marketing, distribution and other operating expenses, 
including those applicable to the generation of ancillary revenues, decreased 4.0% on a per-ASM basis in the 2012 
fiscal year, while in absolute terms, these costs increased 7.8%, from EUR167.0 million in the 2011 fiscal year to 
EUR180.0 million in the 2012 fiscal year, with the overall increase primarily reflecting the higher level of activity and 
increased onboard product costs reflecting the higher level of sales.
 Operating profit. As a result of the factors outlined above, operating profit increased 24.6% on a per-ASM basis in 
the 2012 fiscal year, and also increased in absolute terms, from EUR488.2 million in the 2011 fiscal year to 
EUR683.2 million in the 2012 fiscal year. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Ryanair Has Decided to 
Seasonally Ground Aircraft. The Company's decision to ground aircraft did not have a material impact on the results 
of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2012 and, at present, is not anticipated to have a material impact on 
future operations. The Company anticipates that any revenues which could have been generated had the Company 
operated the grounded aircraft, would have been lower than the operating costs associated with operating these 
aircraft, due to significantly higher fuel costs, airport charges and taxes. The Company does not anticipate that any 
material staff costs will be incurred during future periods of the grounding of aircraft, as the relevant staff can be 
furloughed under the terms of their contract without compensation and the maintenance costs associated with the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -38-
grounded aircraft will be minimal. However, the Company will still incur aircraft ownership costs comprised of 
depreciation and amortization costs, lease rentals costs and financing costs.
 Finance income. Ryanair's interest and similar income increased 62.5%, from EUR27.2 million in the 2011 fiscal 
year to EUR44.3 million in the 2012 fiscal year reflecting the improved yield on term deposits.
 Finance expense. Ryanair's interest and similar charges increased 16.3%, from EUR93.9 million in the 2011 fiscal 
year to EUR109.2 million in the 2012 fiscal year, primarily due to higher interest rates in the 2012 fiscal year 
compared to the 2011 fiscal year. These costs are expected to increase as Ryanair further expands its fleet.
 Foreign exchange gains/losses.Ryanair recorded foreign exchange gains of EUR4.3 million in the 2012 fiscal year, 
as compared with foreign exchange losses of EUR0.6 million in the 2011 fiscal year, with the different result being 
primarily due to the weakening of the euro against the U.K. pound sterling during the 2012 fiscal year.
 Taxation. The effective tax rate for the 2012 fiscal year was 11.5%, as compared to an effective tax rate of 11.0% 
in the 2011 fiscal year. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory rate of Irish corporation tax of 12.5%. Ryanair 
recorded an income tax provision of EUR72.6 million in the 2012 fiscal year, compared with a tax provision of 
EUR46.3 million in the 2011 fiscal year, with the increase primarily reflecting higher pre-tax profits. The 
determination regarding the recoverability of the deferred tax asset was based on future income forecasts, which 
demonstrated that it was more likely than not that future profits would be available in order to utilize the deferred tax 
asset. A deferred tax asset's recoverability is not dependent on material improvements over historical levels of pre-
tax income, material changes in the present relationship between income reported for financial and tax purposes, or 
material asset sales or other non-routine transactions.
 FISCAL YEAR 2011 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2010
 Profit after taxation. Ryanair recorded a profit on ordinary activities after taxation of EUR374.6 million in the 2011 
fiscal year, as compared with a profit of EUR305.3 million in the 2010 fiscal year. This profit was primarily 
attributable to an increase in revenues driven by a 12.3% increase in average fares and a 20.8% increase in 
ancillary revenues, partially offset by a 37.3% increase in fuel and oil costs from EUR893.9 million to EUR1,227.0 
million.
 Scheduled revenues. Ryanair's scheduled passenger revenues increased 21.6%, from EUR2,324.5 million in the 
2010 fiscal year, to EUR2,827.9 million in the 2011 fiscal year, primarily reflecting an increase of 12.3% in average 
fares. The number of passengers booked increased 8.4%, from 66.5 million to 72.1 million, reflecting increased 
scheduled passenger volumes on existing passenger routes and the successful launch of new bases at  Barcelona 
(El Prat), Gran Canaria, Kaunas, Lanzarote, Malta, Seville, Tenerife and Valencia in the 2011 fiscal year. There was 
a one-percentage-point increase in booked passenger load factors from 82% in the 2010 fiscal year to 83% in the 
2011 fiscal year.
 Passenger capacity (as measured in ASMs) during the 2011 fiscal year increased by 18.5% due to the addition of 
40 Boeing 737-800 aircraft (net of disposals), as well as a 7.8% increase in sectors flown and a 9.9% increase in 
the average length of passenger haul. Scheduled passenger revenues accounted for 77.9% of Ryanair's total 
revenues for the 2011 fiscal year, compared with 77.8% of total revenues in the 2010 fiscal year.
 Ancillary revenues. Ryanair's ancillary revenues, which comprise revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, 
in-flight sales and Internet-related services, increased 20.8%, from EUR663.6 million in the 2010 fiscal year to 
EUR801.6 million in the 2011 fiscal year, while ancillary revenues per booked passenger increased to EUR11.12 
from EUR9.98. Revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, including revenues from excess baggage charges, 
debit and credit card transactions, sales of rail and bus tickets, accommodations, travel insurance and car rental 
increased 16.3% to EUR574.2 million from EUR493.5 million in the 2010 fiscal year. Revenues from in-flight sales 
increased 16.4%, to EUR100.7 million from EUR86.5 million in the 2010 fiscal year. Revenues from Internet-related 
services, primarily commissions received from products sold on Ryanair.com or linked websites, increased 51.5%, 
from EUR83.6 million in the 2010 fiscal year to EUR126.7 million in the 2011 fiscal year. The rate of increase in 
revenues from all ancillary revenue categories exceeded the increase in overall passengers booked.
 The following table sets forth the components of ancillary revenues earned by Ryanair and each component 
expressed as a percentage of total ancillary revenues for each of the periods indicated:

 ============  =========  ===========  ========
Operating expenses. As a percentage of total revenues, Ryanair's operating expenses remained unchanged at 
86.5% in the 2011 fiscal year as compared to the 2010 fiscal year, as the impact of the increase in total revenues 
was offset by a corresponding increase in operating expenses. In absolute terms, total operating expenses 
increased 21.5%, from EUR2,586.0 million in the 2010 fiscal year to EUR3,141.30 million in the 2011 fiscal year, 
principally as a result of a 37.3% increase in fuel costs from EUR893.9 million in the 2010 fiscal year to EUR1,227.0 
million in the 2011 fiscal year. Staff costs, depreciation and amortization maintenance expenses, aircraft rental 
expenses, route charges, airport handling charges and marketing, distribution and other costs decreased as a 
percentage of total revenues, while fuel and oil increased. Total operating expenses per ASM increased by 2.5%, 
with the increase reflecting, principally the increase in passenger capacity (as measured in ASMs) during the 2011 
fiscal year and the impact of the higher fuel costs.

 RYANAIR CONDEMNS DAA FAT CAT'S LATEST QUANGO ROLE
 Ryanair, Ireland favourite airline, today (17th June) condemned DAA Fat Cat boss Declan Collier's (who received a 
EUR600,000 salary last year) latest quango role while he continues to preside over two half empty terminals at 
Dublin Airport, and record traffic declines at the three DAA airports.
 Mr Collier's latest quango bauble, as President of the high cost monopoly airport association (Airport Council 
International), comes in addition to Mr Collier's other quango role as Public Interest Director on the Govt owned AIB 
bank, where last year he was paid some EUR50,000 to rubber-stamp big payoffs for failed bank managers.
 Having developed the EUR1.2bn white elephant T2 at Dublin Airport, and presided over a 40% fees increase at 
Dublin Airport last year, Mr Collier is ideally placed to advise the other monopoly airports on how to jack-up costs 
and destroy traffic while getting paid Fat Cat packages in return for failure.
 Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said;
 "Today is another great day for the Fat Cat quango king Declan Collier. Now in addition to receiving over 
EUR600,000 for mismanaging the DAA and some EUR50,000 for representing the public interest in the 
mismanaged AIB, he can bring his undoubted talent for mismanagement and Fat Cat pay and perks to another 
useless quango such as Airports Council International. Today's appointment shows yet again that failure is no 
barrier to appointments to Fat Cat quangos.
 While Mr Collier is wasting time and money with ACI in Brussels, his day job in the DAA and his pubic interest role 
in AIB continue to suffer from his mismanagement and decline."

                    RYANAIR'S LOW FARES ARRIVE IN SANTIAGO!
                           NEW ROUTE TO LONDON STANSTED
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline today (Tuesday, 11th January 2005)
announced a new direct route from Santiago De Compostela to London Stansted. The
new route will commence on 11th April 2005 and will operate daily with fares
starting from just EUR2.99*
Announcing the new route today, Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said:
        "For the first time the people of Galicia can enjoy Ryanair's low fares
         revolution! When it comes to low fares in Europe Ryanair is No 1. Other
         airlines pretend to be low fares but when it comes to low fares Ryanair
         leaves the others in our slipstream. Our new route commences on 11th
         April 2005 with fares starting from just EUR2.99*!
        "This new low fares route is good news for consumers and good news for
         Galicia. Ryanair will carry 100,000 passengers on its 1st year on this
         new low fares route and will deliver 75,000 visitors to Santiago and
         wider Galicia. This translates to the direct creation of 100 jobs for
         the region and savings of EUR10 M for these consumers over the high fares
         airlines".

 The credit risk associated with the Company's financial assets principally relates to the credit risk of the Ryanair

certain of its subsidiary company liabilities. Details of these arrangements are given in Note 34 to the company 
financial statements.
 34 Contingencies

Holdings plc paid a special dividend of EUR500 million, (33.57 euro cent per ordinary share), to shareholders. Prior

sufficient distributable profits to effect the dividend payment, on June 15, 2010, Ryanair Limited declared a dividend 
of EUR400 million to Ryanair Holdings plc.
 The Company previously indicated in a June 1, 2010 announcement, that it may return a further amount of up to

 RYANAIR BUYS 5 MORE BOEING 737-800 AIRCRAFT
 NEW ORDER INCREASES FROM 175 TO 180 UNITS, WITH 4 IN 2015 & 1 IN 2016
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today (30 Apr) confirmed that it has agreed to buy 5 more 737-800 
series aircraft directly from Boeing, 4 of which will be delivered in early Summer 2015, with the 5(th) in February 
2016, in a deal which increases Ryanair's order book from 175 to 180 new Boeing aircraft.  These 5 new aircraft 
brings the value of Ryanair's order book to over $16 billion at current list prices.  Ryanair will now take 21 aircraft 
deliveries (up from 17) between September 2014 and July 2015, which will enable the airline to open more routes 
and additional frequencies on existing routes for Summer 2015.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, said:
 "We are delighted that our partners Boeing have identified 5 new aircraft slots (4 of them before the 2015 Summer 
peak), which allows Ryanair to increase our order book from 175 to 180 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft. These new 
Boeing aircraft enable Ryanair to keep the fleet average age below 5 years, while providing our customers with 
unmatched punctuality, reliability and an improved customer experience. Now that we have 4 more aircraft (21 in 
total) for Summer 2015, Ryanair will offer more new routes and increased frequencies to more customers than ever 
before."
 Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO, Ray Conner, said:
 "Ryanair and Boeing share a relationship that spans 20 years. We are honoured that in that time Ryanair has 
become the largest 737-800 customer in the world - and with today's announcement have a backlog of 180 
airplanes on order. The 737-800 is recognized for its reliable operating performance and will provide Ryanair 
passengers with the flexibility they need for their low-cost travel."

 RYANAIR PLACES ORDER FOR UP TO 200 NEW
 BOEING 737 MAX 200 AIRCRAFT WORTH UP TO $22BN
 RYANAIR BECOMES LEAD OPERATOR OF "GAMECHANGER" AIRCRAFT, WHICH FIRST DELIVERS IN 2019 & WILL FACILITATE 
GROWTH FROM 112M CUSTOMERS IN 2019 TO 150M BY 2024
 Ryanair, the world's biggest international scheduled airline, today (8(th) Sept) signed an agreement with 
Boeing to purchase up to 200 new Boeing 737 MAX 200 "gamechanger" aircraft (100 firm & 100 options).  When 
finalised and all options exercised, this deal will be worth over $22bn at current list prices.  Ryanair 
becomes the lead customer for this new aircraft which for Ryanair will feature 197 seats (8 more than 
Ryanair's existing 737-800s) and new CFM LEAP-1B engines, which combined with aerodynamic improvements 
will reduce fuel consumption by up to 18% in Ryanair's configuration and reduce operational noise 
emissions by 40%. This will further reduce Ryanair's industry leading low costs, and these savings will be 
passed on via lower fares to Ryanair's customers, which will now grow from 82m in 2014 to over 150m 
customers p.a. by the end of the delivery stream in FY2024.
 This new agreement was signed by Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, and Boeing Commercial Airplanes President 
and CEO Ray Conner, in New York this morning (8(th) Sept).  Following approval by Ryanair's shareholders 
at an EGM in late November, this order will become Boeing's largest ever aircraft order from a European 
airline. It will sustain thousands of skilled manufacturing jobs in Boeing and its supplier companies and 
represents the largest ever capital investment by an Irish company in US manufacturing and jobs.
 These new Boeing 737 MAX 200s contain new features which will significantly lower Ryanair's operating 
costs, including:-
 1.   197 seats (8 more than Ryanair's existing 189 seat fleet)
 2.   New Boeing Sky Interior to enhance customers' onboard experience
 3.   New slimline seats which will provide more leg room (avg. over 30 inches)
 4.   New CFM LEAP-1B engines, which combined with the Advanced Technology winglet and other aerodynamic 
improvements, will reduce fuel consumption by up to 18% in Ryanair's configuration and reduce operational 
noise emissions by 40%
 Ryanair enters into this new aircraft agreement, the day before it takes delivery of the first of 180 new 
Boeing 737-800 aircraft.  The current 180 aircraft order will see Ryanair's fleet grow from 304 to 420 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR ORDER FOR BOEING 737 MAX 200 AIRCRAFT
(allowing for lease returns), and traffic rise from 82m last year to over 112m by 2019.  Becoming the lead 
operator for the Boeing 737 MAX 200 aircraft secures Ryanair's future growth during the period 2019 to 
2024 in which Ryanair's fleet will rise to 520 aircraft (allowing for sales and lease returns) while 
traffic almost doubles from 82m in FY2014 to 150m passengers p.a. by FY2024.
 Announcing the new Boeing 737 MAX 200 order, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said:
 "Ryanair is proud and honoured to become the lead operator of  Boeing's "gamechanger" 737 MAX 200 
aircraft which will expand our fleet to 520 aircraft by 2024 and create another 3,000 new jobs for pilots, 
cabin crew and engineers in Europe, while allowing us to grow traffic from 82m last year to over 150m p.a. 
by FY2024.
 These new "gamechanger" aircraft will allow Ryanair to lower our costs and airfares, while improving our 
customer experience with more leg room and the Boeing Sky Interior, as we roll out new offers, 
particularly for our Business Plus and Family Extra customers.  As many of Europe's flag carriers cut 
capacity on short haul routes, Ryanair looks forward to using these new Boeing 737 MAX 200 aircraft to 
grow at many more of Europe's primary airports.
 As I travel to Seattle tomorrow (9(th) September) to take delivery of the first of our 180 new Boeing 
Next-Generation 737-800 aircraft, I'm proud that Ryanair operates the largest fleet of Boeing airplanes in 
Europe, that we will grow over the next decade to 150m customers annually, while at the same time cutting 
our fuel consumption by 18% and operational noise emissions by 40%. We will also create more than 3,000 
new jobs and exciting promotion opportunities for Ryanair's pilots, cabin crew and engineers.  Ryanair is 
proud to be chosen by Boeing as the lead operator of Boeing's new "gamechanger" 737 MAX 200 and we're 
proud to be investing over $22bn in high quality US manufacturing and jobs."
 Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner said:
 "The 737 MAX 200 is the perfect fit for Ryanair, providing improved efficiencies, 20% lower emissions, 
increased revenues and a high level of passenger comfort. The new variant will play a significant role in 
enabling the airline to continue to expand its operations, while providing passengers across Europe with 
outstanding value. For everyone at Boeing, it is an honour to launch the 737 MAX 200 with Ryanair, one of 
the world's most successful all-Boeing operators."

                       RYANAIR TO EXPAND ROUTES IN ITALY
                OFFERS FREE FLIGHTS TO STRANDED VOLARE PASSENGERS
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today (Wednesday, 24th November 2004)
announced expansion plans in the Italian market to assist the many hundreds of
thousands of passengers disrupted as a result of the collapse of Volare on
Friday evening last.
Ryanair's Deputy Chief Executive, Michael Cawley unveiled these plans at a press
conference in Milan today which comprise:
        1.Ryanair announced a new twice daily service from Paris (Beauvais) to
         Venice (Treviso) which is Ryanair's 65th international route to and from
         Italy and means that Ryanair now flies on nine of the eleven
         international routes previously flown by Volare from Italy to other EU
         destinations. Ryanair is operating most of these routes with greater
         frequency and lower fares than those sold by Volare.
    Volare Routes            Ryanair Routes
     Milan-Barcelona          Milan (Bergamo)-Barcelona (Girona)
     Milan-Paris              Milan (Bergamo)-Paris (Beauvais)
     Milan-Prague             No Service
     Milan-Valencia           Milan (Bergamo)-Valencia
Ryanair Holdings PLC RY to expand routes in Italy
    Rome-Barcelona           Rome (Ciampino)-Barcelona (Girona)
     Rome-Paris               Rome (Ciampino)-Paris (Beauvais)
     Rome-Valencia            Rome (Ciampino)-Valencia
    Venice-Barcelona         Venice (Treviso)-Barcelona (Girona)
     Venice-Madrid            No Service
     Venice-Paris             Venice (Treviso)-Paris (Beauvais)
    Bologna-Paris            Venice (Treviso)-Paris (Beauvais)
        2.Ryanair has undertaken to offer free flights* to all passengers,
         booked to travel Volare, on any one of these routes, during the period
         from 1st December to 17th March next (excluding the peak Christmas
         period of 22nd Dec to 4th Jan - when many of Ryanair's flights are
         already sold out). Stranded Volare passengers can make a booking on
         these routes, from today (Wednesday 24th November 04) until
         midnight 2nd Dec 04,subject to availability by accessing
         Ryanair's website at www.ryanair.com, and entering a member
         mode by keying in their Volare  web booking confirmation.
         Passengers will be offered a fare of EUR0 and
         will only be obliged to pay Government taxes and airport charges for
         each of the relevant routes. There are a total of 400,000 seats
         available on these routes, and all bookings of these free flights will
         be on a first come first served basis and are subject to seat
         availability.
*Free flight = EUR zero fare but the passenger pays any relevant Government taxes
and airport charges.
        3.Ryanair has invited all of the Italian airports affected by the
         collapse of Volare to meetings in Milan on Wednesday and Thursday of
         this week to discuss the possibility of Ryanair offering low fare
         domestic flights within Italy on those routes that were previously
         operated by Volare. Ryanair has undertaken that any passengers who have
         lost out as a result of the Volare collapse on domestic routes would be
         offered a similar period of free fares on any domestic routes
         subsequently launched by Ryanair in Italy.
Announcing details of this rescue package for stranded Volare passengers in
Milan today, Ryanair's Deputy Chief Executive, Michael Cawley said:
        "Even before the collapse of Volare, Ryanair was already Italy's second
         largest and lowest fares airline. Our comprehensive network of
         international routes to and from Italy with the addition of this new
         Venice-Paris service means that we can offer all international
         passengers stranded by Volare a flight on a similar international route.
         Our offer of free flights (subject only to Government taxes and airport
         charges) will mean that these passengers will have the opportunity of
         travelling on their chosen route without losing the vast majority of the
         air fare paid to Volare, and we look forward to reuniting friends and
         families that may have been stranded by the unfortunate but inevitable
         demise of Volare".
        "Clearly a lot of Italian airports have lost significant traffic volumes
         as a result of Volare's collapse and we have invited all of these
         airports to meetings in Milan this week to see if we can help them to
         launch low fare domestic and international routes, to make up for the
         traffic they have lost as a result of Volare's collapse. Ryanair already
         flies to almost all of the airports in Italy previously served by Volare
         and we expect to announce further route expansion to and from these
         airports in the not too distant future subject to the successful
         conclusion of satisfactory agreements with these airports"
Ryanair Holdings PLC RY to expand routes in Italy
        "The collapse of Volare last week is the second significant collapse
         (V-Bird was the first) in the European low fares sector this Winter.
         Ryanair was the first to predict that there would be a bloodbath this
         Winter which would result in the collapse of loss making low fare
         airlines. With intense competition all over Europe and high oil prices,
         only the strongest low fares airlines will survive Volare will not be
         the last. Many other airlines talk about low fares, but none can match
         Ryanair's low fares, our punctuality or our customer service. We have
         enjoyed enormous growth in the Italian market over the past three years
         and we expect that Ryanair's pro-passenger response to the collapse of
         Volare will enable us to continue to grow and expand in the Italian
         market".
Ends.                            Wednesday, 24th November 2004

 ==========  =========  =========
FISCAL YEAR 2014 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2013
 Profit after taxation. Ryanair recorded a profit on ordinary activities after taxation of EUR522.8 million in the 2014 
fiscal year, as compared with a profit of EUR569.3 million in the 2013 fiscal year. This 8.2% decrease was primarily 
attributable to an increase in total operating expenses of 5.1%, and a 3.7% reduction in average fares, offset, in 
part, by strong ancillary revenues and increased traffic.
 Scheduled revenues. Ryanair's scheduled passenger revenues decreased 0.8%, from EUR3,819.8 million in the 
2013 fiscal year, to EUR3,789.5 million in the 2014 fiscal year, primarily reflecting a decrease of 3.7% in average 
fares. The number of passengers booked increased 3.0%, from 79.3 million to 81.7 million, reflecting increased 
passenger volumes on existing routes and the successful launch of new bases at Athens, Thessaloniki, Brussels 
(Zaventem) , Lisbon, Rome (Fiumicino), Catania, Lamezia and Palermo in the 2014 fiscal year.  Booked passenger 
load factors increased to 83% in fiscal 2014 compared with 82% in fiscal 2013.
 Passenger capacity during the 2014 fiscal year increased by 2.4% due to an increase in the average number of 
aircraft in the fleet. Scheduled passenger revenues accounted for 75.2 % of Ryanair's total revenues for the 2014 
fiscal year, compared with 78.2% of total revenues in the 2013 fiscal year.
 Ancillary revenues. Ryanair's ancillary revenues, which comprise revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, 
in-flight sales and Internet-related services, increased 17.2%, from EUR1,064.2 million in the 2013 fiscal year to 
EUR1,247.2 million in the 2014 fiscal year, while ancillary revenues per booked passenger increased to EUR15.27 
from EUR13.43. Revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, including revenues from excess baggage 
charges, administration/credit card fees, sales of rail and bus tickets, priority boarding, reserved seating, 
accommodation, travel insurance and car rental increased 21.6% to EUR1,012.4 million from EUR832.9 million in 
the 2013 fiscal year. Revenues from in-flight sales increased 6.8%, to EUR117.3 million from EUR109.8 million in 
the 2013 fiscal year. Revenues from Internet-related services, primarily commissions received from products sold 
on Ryanair.com or linked websites, decreased 3.3%, from EUR121.5 million in the 2013 fiscal year to EUR117.5 
million in the 2014 fiscal year, reflecting a combination of factors including an improved product mix and the 
implementation of a reserved seating system across the network. The rate of increase in ancillary revenues 
exceeded that of the increase in overall passengers booked.
 The following table sets forth the components of ancillary revenues earned by Ryanair and each component 
expressed as a percentage of total ancillary revenues for each of the periods indicated:

Operating expenses. As a percentage of total revenues, Ryanair's operating expenses increased from 85.3% in the 
2013 fiscal year to 86.9% in the 2014 fiscal year. Total revenues increased by 3.1%, slower than the 5.1% increase 
in operating expenses. In absolute terms, total operating expenses increased 5.1%, from EUR4,165.8 million in the 
2013 fiscal year to EUR4,378.1 million in the 2014 fiscal year, principally as a result of a 6.8% increase in fuel and 
oil costs from EUR1,885.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year to EUR2,013.1 million in the 2014 fiscal year, partially 
offset by the weakening of the U.K. pound sterling to the euro. Airport and handling charges, maintenance, 
materials and repairs and marketing, distribution and other costs decreased as a percentage of total revenues, 
while staff costs, depreciation, route charges and fuel and oil expenses increased and aircraft rental expenses 
stayed constant. Total operating expenses per passenger increased by 2.0%, with the increase reflecting, 
principally, the increase in passenger capacity during the 2014 fiscal year and the impact of the higher fuel costs.
 The Company's decision to ground aircraft did not have a material impact on the results of the Company for the 
year ended March 31, 2014  and, at present, is not anticipated to have a material impact on future operations. The 
Company anticipates that any revenues which could have been generated had the Company operated the 
grounded aircraft would have been lower than the operating costs associated with operating these aircraft, due to 
significantly higher fuel costs, airport charges and taxes. The Company does not anticipate that any material staff 
costs will be incurred during future periods of the grounding of aircraft, as the relevant staff can be furloughed under 
the terms of their contracts without compensation and the maintenance costs associated with the grounded aircraft 
will be minimal. However, the Company will still incur aircraft ownership costs comprised of depreciation and 
amortization costs, lease rentals costs and financing costs.

Ryanair Holdings PLC
29 July 2004
                 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES NEW STAFF SHARE OPTIONS PLAN
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (Thursday, 29th July 2004)
confirmed a second grant on its share option scheme for all permanent staff.
Share options will average 20% of their pay at a strike price of EUR4.41. No
employee will receive less than EUR4,200.00 in this allocation. This is the second
tranche of shares issued to staff since the Company floated in 1997 and is
Revenue Commissioners approved and therefore qualifies for capital gains tax of
20%.
Since 1998, Ryanair's people have shared in the Company's success with over 30
million shares granted at a value of over EUR130M.
All qualifying staff at Ryanair will shortly receive information outlining their
share option value and the amount of allocated shares.
Ryanair CEO, Michael O'Leary said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC New Staff Share Option
        "Although the European airline industry is enduring difficult times, all
         Ryanair's staff are working hard to ensure Ryanair provides the lowest
         fares and best customer service. We expect the very tough trading
         conditions to continue and be particularly difficult this coming winter.
         This new scheme reflects the current low share price and allows our
         people to share in future increases of the share price.
        "Ryanair continues to demonstrate its commitment to its people by
         providing rewarding careers with industry leading pay and conditions -
         this latest update to the staff share scheme is just the latest
         confirmation of our policy."
Ends.                          Thursday, 29th July 2004

Body
 Using the debt capital markets to finance the Company and the 2013 Boeing Contract requires the Company to 
obtain and retain investment grade credit ratings, (the Company has a BBB+ (stable) credit rating from S&P and a 
BBB+ (stable) credit rating from Fitch). There is a risk that the Company will be unable, or unwilling, to access these 
markets if it is downgraded or is unable to retain its investment grade credit ratings and this could lead to a higher 
cost of finance for Ryanair.
 Ryanair has also entered into significant derivative transactions intended to hedge its current aircraft acquisition-
related debt obligations. These derivative transactions expose Ryanair to certain risks and could have adverse 
effects on its results of operations and financial condition. See "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures 
About Market Risk."
 The Company's Growth May Expose It to Risks. Ryanair's operations have grown rapidly since it pioneered the 
low-fares operating model in Europe in the early 1990s.  Ryanair intends to continue to expand its fleet and add 
new destinations and additional flights, with the goal of increasing Ryanair's booked passenger volumes to 
approximately 112.0 million passengers per annum by March 31, 2019, an increase of approximately 37% from the 
approximately 81.7 million passengers booked in the 2014 fiscal year. However, no assurance can be given that 
this target will be met. If growth in passenger traffic and Ryanair's revenues do not keep pace with the planned 
expansion of its fleet, Ryanair could suffer from overcapacity and its results of operations and financial condition 
(including its ability to fund scheduled purchases of the New Aircraft and related debt repayments) could be 
materially adversely affected.
 The continued expansion of Ryanair's fleet and operations, at a rate lower than in previous years (although in 
absolute terms it may be higher), in addition to other factors, may also strain existing management resources and 
related operational, financial, management information and information technology systems. Expansion will 
generally require additional skilled personnel, equipment, facilities and systems. An inability to hire skilled personnel 
or to secure required equipment and facilities efficiently and in a cost-effective manner may adversely affect 
Ryanair's ability to achieve its growth plans and sustain or increase its profitability.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -19-
 Ryanair's New Routes and Expanded Operations May Have an Adverse Financial Impact on its Results. Currently, 
a substantial number of carriers operate routes that compete with Ryanair, and the Company expects to face further 
intense competition.
 When Ryanair commences new routes, its load factors and fares tend to be lower than those on its established 
routes and its advertising and other promotional costs tend to be higher, which may result in initial losses that could 
have a material negative impact on Ryanair's results of operations as well as require a substantial amount of cash 
to fund. In addition, there can be no assurance that Ryanair's low-fares service will be accepted on new routes. 
Ryanair also periodically runs special promotional fare campaigns, in particular in connection with the opening of 
new routes. Promotional fares may have the effect of increasing load factors and reducing Ryanair's yield and 
passenger revenues on such routes during the periods that they are in effect. Ryanair has other significant cash 
needs as it expands, including as regards the cash required to fund aircraft purchases or aircraft deposits related to 
the acquisition of additional Boeing 737-800 series aircraft. There can be no assurance that Ryanair will have 
sufficient cash to make such expenditures and investments, and to the extent Ryanair is unable to expand its route 
system successfully, its future revenue and earnings growth will in turn be limited. See "-The Company Will Incur 
Significant Costs Acquiring New Aircraft and Any Instability in the Credit and Capital Markets Could Negatively 
Impact Ryanair's Ability to Obtain Financing on Acceptable Terms."
 Ryanair's Continued Growth is Dependent on Access to Suitable Airports; Charges for Airport Access are Subject 
to Increase. Airline traffic at certain European airports is regulated by a system of grandfathered "slot" allocations. 
Each slot represents authorization to take-off and land at the particular airport during a specified time period. 
Although the majority of Ryanair's bases currently have no slot allocations, traffic at a minority of the airports 
Ryanair serves, including some of its primary bases, is currently regulated through slot allocations. In addition, 
many of the primary airports that Ryanair intends to serve as part of its recent strategic initiatives are subject to slot 
allocations. There can be no assurance that Ryanair will be able to obtain a sufficient number of slots at slot-
controlled airports that it may wish to serve in the future, at the time it needs them, or on acceptable terms. There 
can also be no assurance that its non-slot constrained bases, or the other non-slot constrained airports Ryanair 
serves, will continue to operate without slot allocation restrictions in the future. See "Item 4. Information on the 
Company-Government Regulation-Slots." Airports may impose other operating restrictions such as curfews, limits 
on aircraft noise levels, mandatory flight paths, runway restrictions, and limits on the number of average daily 
departures. Such restrictions may limit the ability of Ryanair to provide service to, or increase service at, such 
airports.
 Ryanair's future growth also materially depends on its ability to access suitable airports located in its targeted 
geographic markets at costs that are consistent with Ryanair's strategy. Any condition that denies, limits, or delays 
Ryanair's access to airports it serves or seeks to serve in the future would constrain Ryanair's ability to grow. A 
change in the terms of Ryanair's access to these facilities or any increase in the relevant charges paid by Ryanair 
as a result of the expiration or termination of such arrangements and Ryanair's failure to renegotiate comparable 
terms or rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. 
For example in Spain, the Spanish government increased airport taxes at the two largest airports, Barcelona and 
Madrid, by over 100%, while smaller increases were implemented at other Spanish airports effective from July 1, 
2012. As a result, Ryanair cancelled routes and reduced capacity on remaining routes from Madrid and Barcelona 
in response to the Spanish government's decision to double airport taxes at the two airports.  For additional 
information, see "Item 4. Information on the Company-Airport Operations-Airport Charges." See also "-The 
Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings Alleging State Aid at Certain Airports."
 The Company's Acquisition of 29.8% of Aer Lingus and Subsequent Failure to Conclude a Complete Acquisition of 
Aer Lingus Could Expose the Company to Risk. During the 2007 fiscal year, the Company acquired 25.2% of Aer 
Lingus. The Company increased its interest to 29.3% during the 2008 fiscal year, and to 29.8% during the 2009 
fiscal year at a total aggregate cost of EUR407.2 million. Following the acquisition of its initial stake and upon the 
approval of the Company's shareholders, management proposed to effect a tender offer to acquire the entire share 
capital of Aer Lingus. This 2006 offer was, however, prohibited by the European Commission on competition 
grounds.
 In October 2007, the European Commission reached a formal decision that it would not force Ryanair to sell its 
shares in Aer Lingus. This decision has been affirmed on appeal. However, EU legislation may change in the future 
to require such a forced disposition. If eventually forced to dispose of its stake in Aer Lingus, Ryanair could suffer 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -19-
significant losses due to the negative impact on market prices of the forced sale of such a significant portion of Aer 
Lingus' shares.
 The United Kingdom's Office of Fair Trading ("OFT") wrote to Ryanair in September 2010, advising that it intended 
to investigate Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair objected on the basis that the OFT's investigation was 
time-barred. On June 15, 2012, the OFT referred the investigation of Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus to the 
U.K. Competition Commission (the "Competition Commission").
 On June 19, 2012, Ryanair announced its third all cash offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of Aer Lingus it 
did not own at a price of EUR1.30 per ordinary share and immediately commenced pre-notification discussions with 
the European Commission for the purpose of preparing a merger filing.  Ryanair contended that, pending the 
outcome of the European Commission's review of Ryanair's bid, on the basis of the duty of "sincere cooperation" 
between the EU and the Member States, and under the EU Merger Regulation, the UK Competition Commission's 
investigation of Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus should not have properly proceeded.  Nevertheless, Aer 
Lingus argued that the investigation should proceed and that Ryanair's offer was in breach of certain provisions of 
the UK Enterprise Act 2002.

 DANISH COURT CONFIRMS RYANAIR IS CONSUMER'S
 NO.1 AIRLINE IN DENMARK
 Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today welcomed a Danish court's
 decision which confirms that Ryanair is the Danish consumer's No. 1 airline
 for low fares, punctuality and customer service.
 The court confirmed that Ryanair's advertisements showed the lowest fares
 and that no complaints were received by Danish consumers. Earlier in court
 the Danish Ombudsman had admitted the complaints were filed by the high fare
 airlines SAS and MAERSK.
 Speaking in Denmark today, Ryanair spokesman Warwick Brady said: "We're
 delighted with the court decision, which threw out these baseless claims
 against Ryanair.
 "Ryanair has flown over 650,000 passengers to and from Denmark since 1999,
 saving Danish consumers millions over the high prices of SAS and Maersk.
 "The judge acknowledged the case was about SAS and MAERSK and not the
 consumer. The Ombudsman should resign now that he has admitted putting the
 interests of SAS and Maersk ahead of the Danish consumers. Ryanair has
 provided Danish consumers with Europe's No. 1 low fares, punctuality and
 customer service and the SAS/Maersk high fare airlines don't like it".

        RYANAIR CALLS ON POLISH GOVERNMENT TO INTRODUCE AIRPORT REFORMS
                 100,000 SEATS FOR 1 ZLOTY* ON 18 POLISH ROUTES
              100 FREE FLIGHTS** FOR SUPPORTERS OF AIRPORT REFORM
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline today (Tuesday, 11th April 2006)
called on the Polish Government to reform the management of its airports by
abolishing rigid centralised tariffs, which place regional airports at a
disadvantage and hinders their ability to grow. Ryanair also called on the
Government to open a secondary airport for Warsaw in Modlin, which would
significantly increase competition, and lower airfares for all passengers and
visitors to Warsaw.
If such reforms are made, Polish consumers would enjoy massive improvements in
low fare access to and from the regions allowing tourism and business to prosper
through increased visitor numbers. Ryanair alone would deliver an increase in
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR URGE POLISH GOVERNMEN
traffic from 1.6M to 10M passengers p.a. supporting 10,000 Polish jobs within 5
years.
Speaking today in Warsaw, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO said:
        "Poland has already benefited enormously from the growth that Ryanair
         low fares have brought, but if this is to continue, the Polish
         Government must introduce significant reform of its outdated airport
         system.
        "Regional airports in Poland must be allowed to fulfil their potential
         as wealth and job creators in their regions but they cannot do this when
         their costs are controlled centrally in Warsaw, restricting their
         capacity to compete for new business.
        "We are also calling on the Polish Government to open a secondary
         airport for Warsaw at the ex military base in Modlin. All over Europe
         secondary competing airports around major cities have been hugely
         beneficial in driving down airfares and increasing visitor numbers to
         capital cities.
        "Ryanair is committed to reducing the cost of travel for Polish
         consumers and visitors. We can only do this, if regional Polish airports
         are freed to compete on a level playing field for growth. To show we are
         serious about delivering growth in Poland if reforms are implemented,
         Ryanair is today offering 100,000 seats on 18 of its Polish routes for 1
         zloty* on www.ryanair.com. In addition, the first 100 people who email
         messages of support for reform in Polish airports to
         polishsupport@ryanair.com will receive a free flight**".

 RYANAIR PROFITS RISE BY 18% TO RECORD EUR237M.
 TRAFFIC GROWTH OF 29%, NET MARGIN OF 25%
 Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Monday, 7(th) November 2005) announced record half year profits 
of EUR237m.  Traffic grew by 29% to 18.0m passengers, yields increased by 3% and as a result total revenues 
rose by 33% to EUR946.2m.  Unit costs increased by 8% (excluding fuel they fell by 7%) as fuel costs rose by 
108% to EUR236.9m.  As a result of these significantly higher fuel costs, Ryanair's adjusted after tax margin for the 
half year fell by 3 points to 25% as adjusted net profit increased by 18% to EUR237m.

Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results
Note 1:    Adjusted profit after tax and EPS during the half year ended 30 September 2005 excludes a 
receipt, net of tax, of EUR5.2m arising from the settlement of an insurance claim for the scribing of 6 
Boeing 737-200 aircraft.
 Announcing these results Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, said:
 "These record traffic and profits reflect the continued successful roll-out of Ryanair's lowest fare 
model despite difficult trading conditions characterised by record high fuel prices and intense 
competition.  It also demonstrates the robustness of the Ryanair model, which delivers significant profits 
and passenger growth even during turbulent periods while many competitors are losing money.
 "As anticipated, yields were 3% higher than last year despite a 29% increase in seat capacity.  These 
slightly higher yields reflect the multiple fuel surcharges imposed by European flag carriers, which have 
continued to widen the gap between their high fares and Ryanair's lowest fares.  We have again reaffirmed 
our commitment not to impose fuel surcharges on our passengers and reaped the benefits of this strategy in 
terms of significant traffic growth and slightly higher yields during the half year.  Ancillary revenues 
grew by 40% significantly faster than the growth in passenger volumes and this year we expect that they 
will continue to outpace passenger growth.
 "Unit costs increased by 8% primarily due to higher fuel costs.  Excluding fuel all other unit costs were 
reduced by 7% thanks to the addition of more lower cost and efficient Boeing 737-800's, new lower cost 
airport and base agreements and continuing tight control over all other cost lines.  We continue to focus 
aggressively on costs and anticipate that the cost reductions achieved will continue to partially offset 
the significantly higher oil prices.
 "Our fuel costs rose by 108% to EUR237m as we were unhedged for almost the entire half year.   For the 
remainder of this fiscal year, to March 2006, we are 90% hedged at rates equivalent to $49 per barrel.  We 
are unhedged thereafter but continue to closely monitor forward prices with a view to hedging our 
requirements for summer of 2006.  However, we expect that fuel prices will continue at these higher levels 
for some time.
 "Our new routes and bases have performed well over the summer with Luton and Liverpool performing 
strongly whilst yields at Shannon continue to be lower than expected.  We recently commenced operations at 
Pisa, our 13(th) European base, in October with 10 routes, and announced our 14(th) base at Nottingham - 
East Midlands which will open in March 2006 with two based aircraft and a total of 15 routes.  We achieved 
a significant milestone during August by carrying more passengers on our shorthaul European network than 
British Airways did on their entire worldwide network in one month.
 "During the half year, we exercised 14 Boeing 737-800 options for delivery in 2007, at which date we plan 
to sell on 5 older Boeing 737-800's delivered in 1999.  This is a continuation of our strategy of 
operating the youngest fleet in Europe with the lowest unit operating costs and delivering the best on 
time performance.  At our recent investor day conference Management highlighted that we plan to double 
passenger volumes and profits by 2012 and believe that we are still now in the early stages of low fare 
development in Europe.  The exercise of these net 9 options is part of our strategy to continue to 
increase seat capacity to satisfy the growing demand for Ryanair's low fares.
 "We continue to fight the levy of unjust taxes on our passengers and we welcome the recent announcement 
by the UK government that it would not impose a GBP1 tax on air tickets.  This GBP1 tax was proposed by 
the CAA to cover their own failure to ensure that scheduled airlines had adequate financial resources to 
fly to and from the UK.  We also oppose the GBP4bn BAA farce at Stansted Airport where the BAA airport 
monopoly propose to build facilities that the users at the airport unanimously oppose, as they are 
extravagant and over specified.  The objective of this inflated proposal is to ensure that the BAA airport 
monopoly can claim a higher return on this GBP4bn of capital expenditure rather than the GBP400m to 
GBP600m, which more accurately reflects the cost of the facilities that the user airlines actually want 
them to build.
 "In Ireland the recent decision by the Commission for Aviation Regulation to allow Dublin Airport to 
increase airport charges by 23% from January next to pay for a proposed 2(nd) terminal, 5 years before it 
is built and without any consultation with the airline users (despite previous government assurances) is 
beyond belief.  We now have the bizarre situation that an over specified future airport development is 
being funded by increasing charges now even though not a sod has been turned on the facility, and there is 
no plan for it to be turned for quite some time.
 "We continue to remain cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year.  We anticipate that 
the fare differentials between Ryanair and the flag carriers will be partially eroded as the fuel 
surchargers are forced to lower their underlying fares to compete with Ryanair's lower prices.  We expect 
to achieve significant increases in passenger's volumes but also anticipate that yields in Q3 will be 
broadly in line with last year and Q4 yields will fall by a range of -5% to -10%, as previously guided.  
Our full year net profit guidance is unchanged.  This winter we expect that there will be continued 
intense competition and there will be fewer low fare carriers in the market as higher fuel prices force 
more carriers out of the industry.  Ryanair's combination of the lowest fare in every market, our lowest 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results
cost base and industry leading customer service will enable us to grow across Europe to the benefit of our 
passengers, our people and our shareholders".

Certain of the information included in this release is forward looking and is subject to important risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  It is not reasonably possible to itemise all of the 
many factors and specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an airline operating in the European 
economy.  Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results 
are the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for the 
replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., 
European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, fluctuations in currency 
exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour relations, the economic environment of the 
airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the UK and Continental Europe, the general 
willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social and political factors.
 Ryanair is Europe's largest low fares airline with 15 bases and 266 low fare routes across 21 countries.  By the end 
of March 2006 Ryanair will operate an entire fleet of 107 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft with firm orders for a further 
127 new aircraft (net of planned disposals), which will be delivered over the next 7 years.  Ryanair currently 
employs a team of 3,000 people and expects to carry approximately 35 million scheduled passengers in the current 
year.

 The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the 2012 
fiscal year are set out below. These have been applied consistently for all periods presented, except as 
otherwise stated.
 Business activity
 Ryanair Limited and its subsidiaries ("Ryanair Limited") has operated as an international airline since 
commencing operations in 1985. On August 23, 1996, Ryanair Holdings Limited, a newly formed holding 
company, acquired the entire issued share capital of Ryanair Limited. On May 16, 1997, Ryanair Holdings 
Limited re-registered as a public limited company, Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company"). Ryanair Holdings 
plc and its subsidiaries are hereafter together referred to as "Ryanair Holdings plc" (or "we", "our", 
"us", "Ryanair" or the "Company") and currently operate a low-fares airline headquartered in Dublin, 
Ireland. All trading activity continues to be undertaken by the group of companies headed by Ryanair 
Limited.
 Statement of compliance
 In accordance with the International Accounting Standards ("IAS") Regulation (EC 1606 (2002)) which 
applies throughout the European Union ("EU"), the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(collectively "IFRS") as adopted by the EU, which are effective for the year ended and as at March 31, 
2012. In addition to complying with its legal obligation to comply with IFRS as adopted by the EU, the 
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB"). The consolidated financial statements have also been 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012.
 Details of legislative changes and new accounting standards or amendments to accounting standards, which 
are not yet effective and have not been early adopted in these consolidated financial statements, and the 
likely impact on future financial statements are set forth below in the prospective accounting changes 
section.
 New accounting standards adopted during the year
 There were no new standards, interpretations or amendments to existing standards adopted for the first 
time during the year ended March 31, 2012, which had a material impact on our financial position or 
results from operations.
 Basis of preparation
 These consolidated financial statements are presented in euro millions, the euro being the functional 
currency of the parent entity and the majority of the group companies. They are prepared on the historical 
cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale securities which are stated 
at fair value, and share-based payments, which are based on fair value determined as at the grant date of 
the relevant share options. Certain non-current assets classified as held for sale are stated at the lower 
of cost and fair value less costs to sell.

   PENNANT INTERNATIONAL GROUP PLC
   Launch of Aviation Skills Charter
   Pennant International Group plc ("Pennant", the "Group", or the "Company"), the AIM quoted supplier of 
integrated training and support solutions, products and services which train and assist operators and 
maintainers in the defence and regulated civilian sectors, is pleased to announce that on 3 September 
2019, at an event at Cranfield University, aviation and aerospace industry leaders and educators came 
together as a unified body to support the launch of a new Charter for Aviation Skills.
   The purpose of this new Charter is to create commitment and responsibility amongst key stakeholders to 
address the widely-recognised shortage of skilled people within UK aviation industry and to formulate a 
tangible, and achievable action plan to deliver more trained pilots, aircraft technicians, air traffic 
controllers and groundcrew.
   Organisations attending the Charter event comprised major OEMs, operators and educational institutions 
and included Airbus, Boeing, British Airways, Ryanair, Leonardo, Marshalls and Cranfield University.
   The Charter, which aligns with the UK Government's draft 'Aviation 2050' strategy, anticipates a multi-
faceted approach to delivering more skilled people for UK aviation, which will include the creation of 
clear pathways into aviation careers, providing a catalyst for industry and educators to establish new 
training courses and academies.
   The Charter launch was co-ordinated by the Aviation Skills Partnership, part of the Pennant Group which 
has been a driving force in tackling this widely recognised skills gap.
   John Ponsonby OBE, Chairman of ASP commented:
   "The UK needs to re-establish its place at the forefront of aviation training to meet a global skills 
gap and to sustain and grow the UK aviation and aerospace industries. Launching this Charter, with its 
associated action plan, is the first step in this critical journey."

 The Company's profit after tax for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 (the first quarter of the Company's 2012 fiscal 
year) was EUR139.3 million, as compared to EUR93.7 million for the corresponding period of the previous year. 
The Company recorded an increase in operating profit, from EUR121.1 million in the first quarter of the 2011 fiscal 
year to EUR169.9 million in the recently completed quarter. Total operating revenues increased from EUR896.8 
million in the first quarter of 2011 to EUR1,155.4 million in the first quarter of 2012. The increase in operating profit 
was primarily due to an 11% increase in average fares and stronger ancillary revenues offset by higher fuel costs. 
Operating expenses increased from EUR775.7 million in the first quarter of 2011 to EUR985.5 million in the first 
quarter of 2012, due primarily to a 49% increase in fuel costs and an increase in other operating costs associated 
with a higher level of activity in line with the growth of the airline. The Company's cash and cash equivalents, 
restricted cash and financial assets with terms of less than three months amounted to EUR3,213.8 million at June 
30, 2011 as compared with EUR3,072.8 million at June 30, 2010.
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 The following discussion and analysis of Ryanair's financial condition and results of operations is based on its 
consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 18 and prepared in accordance with IFRS.
 The preparation of the Company's financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 The Company believes that its critical accounting policies, which are those that require management's most 
difficult, subjective and complex judgments, are those described in this section. These critical accounting policies, 
the judgments and other uncertainties affecting application of these policies and the sensitivity of reported results to 
changes in conditions and assumptions are factors to be considered in reviewing the consolidated financial 
statements included in Item 18 and the discussion and analysis below. For additional detail on these policies, see 
Note 1, "Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies," to the consolidated financial statements included 
in Item 18.
 Long-lived Assets
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -34-
 As of March 31, 2011, Ryanair had EUR4.9 billion of long-lived assets, virtually all of which were aircraft. In 
accounting for long-lived assets, Ryanair must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the 
expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and 
the cash flows they generate.
 In estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft, Ryanair has primarily relied on its own and 
industry experience, recommendations from Boeing, the manufacturer of all of the Company's aircraft, and other 
available marketplace information. Subsequent revisions to these estimates, which can be significant, could be 
caused by changes to Ryanair's maintenance program, changes in utilization of the aircraft, governmental 
regulations on aging of aircraft, changes in new aircraft technology, changes in new aircraft fuel efficiency and 
changing market prices for new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. Ryanair evaluates its estimates and 
assumptions in each reporting period, and, when warranted, adjusts these assumptions. Generally, these 
adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis, through depreciation expense.
 Ryanair periodically evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment. Factors that would indicate potential impairment 
would include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an aircraft, a significant change in 
an aircraft's physical condition and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the aircraft. While the 
airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these factors from time to time, Ryanair has not yet been 
seriously impacted and continues to record positive cash flows from these long-lived assets. Consequently, Ryanair 
has not yet identified any impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet. The Company will continue to monitor its 
long-lived assets and the general airline operating environment.
 The Company's estimate of the recoverable amount of aircraft residual values is 15% of current market value of 
new aircraft, determined periodically, based on independent valuations and actual aircraft disposals during the 
current and prior periods. Aircraft are depreciated over a useful life of 23 years from the date of manufacture to 
residual value.
 During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, accelerated depreciation of EUR51.6 million arose in relation to 
aircraft disposals during the year and an agreement to dispose of additional aircraft in the 2010 fiscal year. In 
particular, this charge arose due to an adverse change in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro 
between the accounting periods in which the aircraft were purchased and March 31, 2009. There was no such 
accelerated depreciation recognized in the 2010 or 2011 fiscal years.
 Heavy Maintenance
 An element of the cost of an acquired aircraft is attributed, on acquisition, to its service potential, reflecting the 
maintenance condition of the engines and airframe.
 For aircraft held under operating lease agreements, Ryanair is contractually committed to either return the aircraft 
in a certain condition or to compensate the lessor based on the actual condition of the airframe, engines and life-
limited parts upon return. In order to fulfill such conditions of the lease, maintenance, in the form of major airframe 
overhaul, engine maintenance checks, and restitution of major life-limited parts, is required to be performed during 
the period of the lease and upon return of the aircraft to the lessor. The estimated airframe and engine maintenance 
costs and the costs associated with the restitution of major life-limited parts, are accrued and charged to profit or 
loss over the lease term for this contractual obligation, based on the present value of the estimated future cost of 
the major airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks and restitution of major life-limited parts, calculated by 
reference to the number of hours flown or cycles operated during the year.
 Ryanair's aircraft operating lease agreements typically have a term of seven years, which closely correlates with 
the timing of heavy maintenance checks. The contractual obligation to maintain and replenish aircraft held under 
operating lease exists independently of any future actions within the control of Ryanair. While Ryanair may, in very 
limited circumstances, sub-lease its aircraft, it remains fully liable to perform all of its contractual obligations under 
the 'head lease' notwithstanding any such sub-leasing.
 Both of these elements of accounting policies involve the use of estimates in determining the quantum of both the 
initial maintenance asset and/or the amount of provisions to be recorded and the respective periods over which 
such amounts are charged to income. In making such estimates, Ryanair has primarily relied on its own and 
industry experience, industry regulations and recommendations from Boeing; however, these estimates can be 
subject to revision, depending on a number of factors, such as the timing of the planned maintenance, the ultimate 
utilization of the aircraft, changes to government regulations and increases or decreases in estimated costs. 
Ryanair evaluates its estimates and assumptions in each reporting period and, when warranted, adjusts its 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -34-
assumptions, which generally impact maintenance and depreciation expense in the income statement on a 
prospective basis.

 The following table sets forth certain income statement data (calculated under IFRS) for Ryanair expressed as a

        RYANAIR ANNOUNCES NEW 10 YEAR AGREEMENT WITH BRUSSELS CHARLEROI
                        5 NEW ROUTES AND $240M INVESTMENT
NEW ROUTES FROM BRUSSELS TO FARO, NIMES, MALAGA, SALZBURG, VALENCIA
                      1 MILLION FREE* SEAT SALE TO CELEBRATE
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline today (Wednesday, 14th December 2005)
announced a new 10 year agreement committing it to develop Brussels Charleroi
Airport until 2016. As part of this agreement Ryanair will base a 4th aircraft
in Charleroi, bringing its total investment in aircraft at Brussels Charleroi to
$240M. The airline will open 5 new routes, from Brussels to Faro, Nimes, Malaga,
Salzburg and Valencia from April 2006 onwards, bringing the total number of
Ryanair routes from Brussels Charleroi to 16. These 5 new routes will deliver
another quarter of a million passengers p.a. and bring Ryanair's annual traffic
at Charleroi to 2.3M .
Announcing this new agreement, and Ryanair's increased investment in BSCA,
Ryanair Holdings PLC 10yr agreement Brussels
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO said:
        "Our new 10 year deal with Brussels Charleroi Airport commits Ryanair to
         invest $240M in new aircraft and deliver 2.3M passengers p.a. These 2.3M
         passengers will save EUR230M annually over the high fares charged at
         Zaventem Airport and based on ACI** figures these passengers will
         generate 2,300 jobs at the airport and in the local Walloon region. In
         addition, visitors brought to the region by Ryanair's low fares will
         spend over EUR200M p.a.
        "In 2001, Ryanair launched its first base in continental Europe at
         Brussels Charleroi and since then it has transformed Charleroi from an
         unknown, unused airfield into the fastest growing airport in Belgium.
         BSCA for its part has responded by recently announcing plans for a new
         terminal capable of handling 5M passengers p.a. which will be opened in
         2007.
        "The passenger growth at Charleroi airport is unrivaled elsewhere in
         Belgium and has been achieved as a result of Ryanair's massive
         investment in aircraft and international advertising to promote low fare
         flights to and from Brussels Charleroi. The recent ill-informed press
         speculation surrounding the current investigation into Promocy is
         completely false and we look forward to co-operating with the Belgian
         authorities on the basis of the following facts:
      + Brussels Charleroi has increased its traffic tenfold since 2001
       + BSCA has developed into a thriving and profitable international
         airport operator
       + Promocy was set up to promote this development of traffic at Brussels
         Charleroi and is funded entirely by Ryanair and airport revenues.
      + Promocy receives/has received no funding from the Walloon region.
       + Any payments made by Promocy to Ryanair are to fund advertising and
         promotional activity of routes from Brussels Charleroi
       + During its 2-yr investigation the EU raised no concerns over the
         funding of Promocy.
        "To celebrate these 5 new routes and the continued growth of Brussels
         Charleroi, Ryanair is giving away 1M FREE* seats on www.ryanair.com
         until midnight Monday".

 --    Amendments to IAS 28: "Long-term interests in Associates and Joint Ventures" (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019)*
 * These standards or amendments to standards are not as yet EU endorsed.
 IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 IFRS 15 is effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018.  The standard establishes 
a five-step model to determine when to recognise revenue and at what amount.  Revenue is recognised when 
the good or service has been transferred to the customer and at the amount to which the entity expects to 
be entitled.
 Ryanair has reviewed the impact of applying IFRS 15 on all of its revenue streams.  For the majority of 
our revenue, the manner in which we currently recognise revenue is consistent with the requirements of 
IFRS 15.  For certain ancillary revenue streams however, the recognition of revenue will be deferred under 
IFRS 15 to the flight date where it is currently recognised on the date of booking.
 This change in the timing of revenue recognition will mean that an increased amount of revenue will be 
recognised in the first half of the year under IFRS 15, with less revenue recognised in the second half of 
the year, particularly in Quarter 4.
 Ryanair expects to apply the standard using the cumulative effect method.  On adoption of the standard, 
the adjustment to retained earnings at April 1, 2018 is expected to be a charge of between EUR250M and 
EUR300M. There will be a corresponding increase in unearned revenue within liabilities.
 IFRS 9: Financial Instruments
 IFRS 9 is effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018.  The standard introduces a 
new model for the classification and measurement of financial assets, a new impairment model based on 
expected credit losses and a new hedge accounting model to more closely align hedge accounting with risk 
management strategy and objectives.
 Financial assets, excluding derivatives, will be accounted for at amortised cost, fair value through 
other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss depending on the nature of the contractual 
cash flows of the asset and the business model in which it is held.  Ryanair has completed a review of its 
financial assets and is satisfied that all of them will continue to be held at amortised cost.  No 
material transition adjustment to carrying values is anticipated.
 Ryanair has reviewed the impact of applying the new expected loss impairment model to its financial 
assets. There will not be a material increase in provisions as a result of applying the new requirements.
 Ryanair does not expect any change from the hedge accounting provisions of IFRS 9.
 IFRS 16: Leases
 IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet, lease accounting model for lessees.  A lessee recognises a 
right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing 
its obligation to make lease payments. There are optional exemptions for short-term leases and leases of 
low value items.
 The standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Early adoption is 
permitted for entities that apply IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers at or before the date of 
initial application of IFRS 16.  Ryanair does not intend to early adopt IFRS 16.
 We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial 
statements and related disclosures but do not expect the impact to be material.
 2.            Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these condensed consolidated preliminary financial statements, the significant judgements 
made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation 
uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial 
statements.
 3.            Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly, 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.            Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the year ended March 31, 2018 
was 10.0% (March 31, 2017: 10.5%).  The tax charge for the year ended March 31, 2018 of EUR161.1M (March 
31, 2017: EUR154.4M) comprises a current tax charge of EUR152.0M and a deferred tax charge of EUR9.1M 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -5-
relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment recognised in the income 
statement.
 5.            Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR6.4M (March 31, 2017: EUR5.7M) is the fair value of 
various share options granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in 
accordance with employee services rendered.
 6.            Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.            Capital commitments
 At March 31, 2018 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 431 (2017: 383) Boeing 737 aircraft.  The Group 
agreed to purchase 183 new Boeing 737-800NG aircraft from the Boeing Corporation during the periods FY15 
to FY19 of which 154 aircraft (including 50 in the financial year) were delivered at March 31, 2018.
 The Group also agreed to purchase up to 210 (110 firm and 100 options) Boeing 737-Max-200 aircraft from 
the Boeing Corporation during the periods FY20 to FY24; these include 10 additional firm orders announced 
in June 2017 which will see aircraft deliveries increase by 5 in both spring 2019 and spring 2020.  This 
also includes a further 25 options that were converted to firm orders in April 2018 (See note 14 below).
 8.            Analysis of operating segment
 The Group is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car-hire, internet income and related sales to third parties. The Group 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.

 RYANAIR AND ONAIR LAUNCH EUROPE'S 1ST FLEET WIDE INFLIGHT MOBILE PHONE SERVICE
PASSENGERS CAN NOW CALL & TEXT ONBOARD 20 RYANAIR AIRCRAFT
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (19th Feb) launched its
 in-flight mobile phone service initially onboard 20 of its (mainly) Dublin based
 aircraft.   This is the first step in fitting Ryanair's entire fleet of over 170
 aircraft to allow all passengers to make and receive mobile calls and texts on
 all Ryanair flights.
Passengers on Ryanair's 20 OnAir enabled aircraft can now make and receive voice
 calls at (non- EU) international roaming rates (EUR2-EUR3 pm) text messages (50c+)
 and email (EUR1-EUR2) using their mobile phones, BlackBerrys and other
 smartphones.These price tariffs are set by each mobile service provider and are
 subject to each customer's individual price plan.
The service will initially be available to "02" and "Vodafone" customers and to
 customers of over 50 other mobile phone operators across Europe.  At the launch
 OnAir confirmed that it is working with other Irish mobile operators ("3" and
 "Meteor") to ensure that their customers can also keep in touch with the office,
 family and friends when travelling.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR & ONAIR LAUNCH INFLIGHT PHONE SERVICE
Michael O'Leary said:
"Today's launch by Ryanair and OnAir is the first step to offering in-flight
 mobile phone services onboard our entire fleet of over 170 aircraft over the
 next 18 months.  This service will allow passengers to keep in touch with the
 office, family or friends.  We expect customer demand for this service to
 grow rapidly and hope that customers of all Irish mobile operators will soon be
 able to call or text home from 30,000 feet to tell loved ones of yet another on
 time Ryanair flight."
Benoit Debains, CEO of OnAir, said,
"Mobile OnAir is the most advanced in-flight communications service in the world
 and this European fleet-wide rollout marks a real milestone in aviation. We are
 proud to work with Ryanair, the world's largest international scheduled airline,
 and to provide their 67 million passengers with access to this new technology
 which will enable them to send and receive emails, text messages, download
 attachments and make and receive calls just as they would on the ground.'

Note to Editor
How it works:
To access Mobile OnAir, passengers simply switch on their GSM-enabled phones
 when cabin signs indicate that the Mobile OnAir service may be used. As long as
 their mobile service provider has a roaming agreement with OnAir, passengers are
 able to use GSM and GPRS services as seamlessly as they would on the ground.
Phones or BlackBerry-type devices connect to an antenna onboard the aircraft and
 a mini-GSM network. The mini-GSM network sends the calls and data via an
 Inmarsat SwiftBroadband satellite link to the ground where it connects to the
 OnAir ground infrastructure. This then routes the calls and data to public
 networks (mobile and fixed network operators).
About pricing:
Pricing is set by your home mobile operator and varies from operator to
 operator. As a general rule, text messages will cost about EUR0.50, calls will
 cost between EUR2.00 and EUR3.00 per minute, and smart phone email sessions between
 EUR1.00 and EUR2.00 if there are no major file transfers (100 KB of data). Please
 check with your home mobile operator for specific rates. Switching on your
 mobile phone and receiving text messages is free. Communications costs will
 appear in the normal way on the bill.

Body
 The Board has carried out its annual evaluation of the independence of each of its non-executive directors, taking 
account of the relevant provisions of the 2012 Code, namely, whether the directors are independent in character 
and judgement and free from relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the 
directors' judgment. The Board regards all of the directors as independent and that no one individual or one 
grouping exerts an undue influence on others.
 The Board has considered Kyran McLaughlin's independence given his role as Deputy Chairman and Head of 
Capital Markets at Davy Stockbrokers. Davy Stockbrokers are one of Ryanair's corporate brokers and provide 
corporate advisory services to Ryanair from time to time. The Board has considered the fees paid to Davy 
Stockbrokers for these services and believe that they are immaterial to both Ryanair and Davy Stockbrokers given 
the size of each organisation's business operations and financial results. Having considered this relationship, the 
Board has concluded that Kyran McLaughlin continues to be an independent non-executive director within the spirit 
and meaning of the 2012 Code Rules.
 The Board has also considered the independence of David Bonderman given his shareholding in Ryanair Holdings 
plc. As at March 31, 2014, David Bonderman had a beneficial shareholding in the Company of 7,655,671 ordinary 
shares, equivalent to 0.55% of the issued share capital. Having considered this shareholding in light of the number 
of issued shares in Ryanair Holdings plc and the financial interest of the director, the Board has concluded that the 
interest is not so material as to breach the spirit of the independence rule contained in the 2012 Code.
 The Board has further considered the independence of Messrs. David Bonderman, James Osborne,  Kyran 
McLaughlin and Michael Horgan as they have each served more than nine years on the Board. The Board 
considers that each of these directors is independent in character and judgment as each has other significant 
commercial and professional commitments and each brings his own level of senior experience gained in their fields 
of international business and professional practice. When arriving at this decision, the Board has taken into account 
the comments made by the FRC in their report dated December, 2009 on their review of the impact and 
effectiveness of the Code, in particular their comment that independence is not the primary consideration when 
assessing the composition of the Board, and that the over-riding consideration should be that the Board is fit for 
purpose. For these reasons, and also because each director's independence is considered annually by the Board, 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -6-
the Board considers it appropriate that these directors have not been offered for annual re-election as is 
recommended by the 2012 Code.  The Nominations Committee have confirmed to the Board that they consider the 
directors offering themselves for re-election at the 2014 AGM to be independent and that they continue to 
effectively contribute to the work of the Board. The Nominations Committee recommends that the Company accept 
the re-election of the directors.
 Board Procedures
 All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and the Board has established a 
procedure whereby directors wishing to obtain advice in the furtherance of their duties may take independent 
professional advice at the Company's expense.
 Directors meet with key executives with a particular focus on ensuring non-executive directors are fully informed on 
issues of relevance to Ryanair and its operations. Extensive papers on key business issues are provided to all 
directors in connection with the Board meetings. All directors are encouraged to update and refresh their skills and 
knowledge, for example, through attending courses on technical areas or external briefings for non-executive 
directors.
 The Company has Directors & Officers liability insurance in place in respect of any legal actions taken against the 
directors in the course of the exercise of their duties. New non-executive directors are encouraged to meet the 
executive director and senior management for briefing on the Company's developments and plans.
 Meetings
 The Board meets at least on a quarterly basis and in the year to March 31, 2014 the Board convened meetings on 
nine occasions. Individual attendance at these meetings is set out in the table on page 24. Detailed Board papers 
are circulated in advance so that Board members have adequate time and information to be able to participate fully 
at the meeting.
 The holding of detailed regular Board meetings and the fact that many matters require Board approval, show that 
the running of the Company is firmly in the hands of the Board. The non-executive directors meet periodically 
without executives being present. Led by the senior independent director, the non-executive directors will meet 
without the Chairman present at least annually to appraise the Chairman's performance and on such other 
occasions as are deemed appropriate.
 Remuneration
 Details of remuneration paid to the directors are set out in Note 19 to the consolidated Financial Statements on 
pages 189 to 191. Also, please see the Report of the Remuneration Committee on Directors' Remuneration on 
page 29.
 Non-executive directors
 Non-executive directors are remunerated by way of directors' fees.  A number of non-executive directors have 
share options. While the 2012 Code notes that the remuneration of the non-executive director should not include 
share options, the Board believes that the quantum of options granted to non-executive directors is not so 
significant as to raise any issue concerning their independence. Michael Horgan is remunerated on a consultancy 
basis on safety issues and also by way of share options.
 Full details are disclosed in Note 19(b) and 19(d) on pages 190 to 191 of the consolidated financial statements.
 Executive director remuneration
 The Chief Executive of the Company is the only executive director on the Board. In addition to his base salary he is 
eligible for a performance bonus of up to 100% of salary and other bonuses dependent upon the achievement of 
certain financial targets and a pension. It is considered that the significant shareholding of the Chief Executive acts 
to align his interests with those of shareholders and gives him a keen incentive to perform to the highest levels.
 Full details of the executive director's remuneration are set out in Note 19(a) on page 190 of the consolidated 
financial statements.
 Share Ownership and Dealing
 Details of the directors' interests in Ryanair shares are set out in Note 19(d) on page 191 of the consolidated 
financial statements.
 The Board has adopted The Model Code, as set out in the Listing Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange and the UK 
Listing Authority, as the code of dealings applicable to dealings in Ryanair shares by directors and relevant 
Company employees. The code of dealing also includes provisions which are intended to ensure compliance with 
US securities laws and regulations of the NASDAQ National market. Under the policy, directors are required to 
obtain clearance from the Chairman or Chief Executive before dealing in Ryanair shares, whilst relevant Company 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -6-
employees must obtain clearance from designated senior management and are prohibited from dealing in the 
shares during prohibited periods as defined by the Listing Rules and at any time at which the individual is in 
possession of inside information (as defined in the Market Abuse (Directive 2003/6/EC) Regulations 2005).
 Board Succession and Structure
 The Board plans for its own succession with guidance from the Nomination Committee. The Nomination Committee 
regularly review the structure, size and composition (including the skills, knowledge and experience) required of the 
Board compared to its current position with regard to the strategic needs of Ryanair and recommends changes to 
the Board. There is a formal, thorough and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors to the Board. 
The Nominations Committee identifies and selects candidates on merit against objective criteria, to ensure that the 
Board have the skills, knowledge and expertise required.
 The Board currently comprises of ten directors, Chief Executive Officer, Michael O' Leary, is the only executive 
director. The nine non-executive directors include Chairman David Bonderman. Biographies of all current directors 
are set out on pages 106 of this report. Ryanair considers that the Board has the correct balance and depth of 
skills, knowledge, expertise and experience to optimally lead the Company and that all directors give adequate time 
to the performance of their duties and responsibilities.
 Ryanair considers that all directors discharge their directorial duties with the objectivity and impartiality they have 
demonstrated since commencing their respective roles and has determined that each of the non-executive directors 
is independent. In reaching that conclusion, Ryanair considered the character, judgement, objectivity and integrity 
of each director and had due regard for the 2012 Code.  Ryanair continually endeavors to maintain the quality and 
independence of its Board.
 Board Committees
 The Board of Directors has established a number of committees, including the following:
 Executive Committee
 The Board of Directors established the Executive Committee in August 1996. The Executive Committee can 
exercise the powers exercisable by the full Board of Directors in circumstances in which action by the Board of 
Directors is required but it is impracticable to convene a meeting of the full Board of Directors. Messrs. David 
Bonderman, Michael O'Leary, Kyran McLaughlin and James Osborne are the members of the Executive 
Committee.
 Audit Committee
 The Board of Directors established the Audit Committee in September 1996.

Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report
Chairman's Report
 Dear Shareholders,
 I am pleased to report a 13% increase in profit after tax to a new record of EUR569m.  This was an 
excellent result despite a EUR292m increase in fuel costs which we managed to offset by a 6% rise in 
average fares and strong growth in ancillary revenues.
 During the year Ryanair delivered a number of significant milestones:
 --      We grew our traffic by 5% to 79.3m passengers.
 --      We took delivery of 15 new aircraft for a year-end fleet of 305 Boeing 737-800's.
 --      We opened 7 new bases and 217 new routes bringing our route/network operated to over 1,600.
 --      We improved our industry leading passenger service with better punctuality, fewer lost bags and 
less cancellations.
 --      We completed a share buyback of EUR67m in April 2012, and paid a special dividend of EUR492m in 
November, 2012.
 Fuel costs in fiscal 2013 as a proportion of our total operating costs have risen to 45%.  We are 90% 
hedged for fiscal 2014, at approximately US$98 per barrel which is almost another EUR200m  increase in our 
fuel bill.  Oil price rises and high winter charges at certain airports will make it commercially sound to 
ground up to 60 aircraft next winter (80 aircraft last year) rather than incur losses operating these 
aircraft at lower winter yields.  Nevertheless, we still expect passenger volumes in fiscal 2014 to grow 
by approximately 3% to 82m passengers.
 At a recent June 2013 EGM shareholders approved our new 175 aircraft order with Boeing.  Net of 
disposals/lease returns this will enable Ryanair's fleet to increase to 410 aircraft and our traffic to 
grow by 39% to 110m by fiscal 2019.  We see tremendous opportunity in Europe to increase passenger volumes 
as our competitors merge/consolidate, cut short-haul capacity and in some cases exit the industry.  This 
new Boeing order at prices "not dissimilar" to our previous 2005 order will enable us to grow our business 
while at the same time locking in advantageous long term ownership costs in our fleet.
 We recently announced Ryanair's plans to return a further EUR1bn to shareholders (subject to shareholder 
approval at our AGM in September) via share buybacks and special dividends by the end of fiscal 2015.  The 
combination of a special dividend and buy backs (subject to shareholder approval) and previous 
buybacks/special dividends completed will mean that Ryanair will return EUR2.53bn to shareholders since 
2008 which is unprecedented in the airline industry.
 I would like to take this opportunity to thank Klaus Kirchberger for his contribution and commitment to 
Ryanair as a director over the last eleven years.  Klaus resigned from the board at the end of March 2013 
and we wish him much success in the future.  I would also like to warmly welcome three new directors 
Louise Phelan, Julie O'Neill and Dick Milliken. Louise and Julie joined the board in December 2012 while 
Dick joined in July 2013. They will all stand for election at the AGM in September, 2013.
 We look forward to growing Ryanair to 110m passengers and 410 aircraft by fiscal 2019.  The outstanding 
people at Ryanair continue to work hard on behalf of shareholders to reduce our costs while at the same 
time delivering the lowest fares in Europe for the benefit of our 82m passengers.
 Yours sincerely,
 David Bonderman
 Chairman
 Chief Executive's Report
 Dear Shareholders,
 Our results emphasise the enduring strength of Ryanair's unique ultra-low cost carrier model (ULCC) in 
Europe. Ryanair delivered a 13% increase in profits to a record EUR569m.  Our traffic grew 5% to 79.3m, as 
load factor remained stable at 82% and average fare (which includes optional checked in bag fees) improved 
by 6% to over EUR48.  Turnover rose 13% to EUR4,884m as ancillary revenues grew by 20% to EUR1,064m.
 Operating costs rose 12% to EUR4,166m mainly due to a EUR292m (18%) increase in our fuel bill to 
EUR1,886m and excessive unjustified price increases at Spanish Airports, where the Government owned AENA 
monopoly continues to raise airport fees while presiding over record traffic declines.  Over the past 5 
years, despite wasting millions on new - and unnecessary - terminals, AENA's traffic has declined from 
210m in 2007 to less than 180m currently.  Ryanair has made offers to AENA to reverse these declines and 
create thousands of jobs in Spanish tourism, but to date these offers have not been accepted.

 Ryanair Holdings plc
 Transaction in own shares
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") has previously announced an intention to return capital to shareholders by 
way of a share buy-back programme to be conducted pursuant to irrevocable arrangements with its brokers, 
Citigroup Global Markets Limited ("Citi") and J&E Davy ("Davy"). The Company today announces that on 18 April 
2016 it purchased for cancellation a total of 433,000 ordinary shares of nominal value EUR0.006 each in the capital 
of the Company ("Ordinary Shares").
 The Ordinary Shares repurchased have been repurchased at an average price of EUR13.0629 per Ordinary Share 
(high of EUR13.0988 and low of EUR13.0487).
 In respect of this programme, which will operate until not later than 31 October 2016, Citi and Davy will make 
trading decisions in relation to Ryanair's Ordinary Shares and American Depositary Receipts repurchased under 
the buy-back programme independently of, and uninfluenced by, Ryanair.  Any such acquisitions will be effected 
within certain pre-set parameters, and in accordance with both Ryanair's general authority to repurchase Ordinary 
Shares and Ordinary Shares underlying American Depositary Receipts, and Chapter 9 of the Listing Rules of the 
Irish Stock Exchange.
 Following the cancellation of the Ordinary Shares repurchased the Company will have 1,281,747,480 Ordinary 
Shares in issue. To the extent that further Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares underlying American 
Depositary Receipts) are repurchased under the programme, these will also be cancelled.

         GBP1 JULY SEAT SALE DRIVES RECORD DAY OF BUSINESS ON RYANAIR.COM
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline today (20th June) announced that it
had recorded its busiest ever day of business on www.ryanair.com on Monday 19th
June. Ryanair.com was launched in 2000 and now accounts for over 98% of all
sales. Yesterday the internet site registered a record 6.5M page views that
resulted in the airline taking 198,000 bookings in a single day.
Announcing the record day of business, Peter Sherrard Ryanair's Head of
Communications said:
"Yesterday the www.ryanair.com servers were going into overdrive to cope with an
unprecedented volume of bookings following the announcement of our GBP1 seat sale.
We are used to our seat sales generating big increases in traffic but because
this sale includes flights for GBP1* during the popular first half of July,
traffic volumes broke all previous records. The record 198,000 bookings is a 16%
Ryanair Holdings PLC SEAT SALE DRIVES RECORD DAY
increase on the previous record set in September 2005.
"Yesterday, Ryanair.com recorded:
   6.5M page views
    198,000 bookings on 341 routes
    18,000 bookings in the 1 hour period between 14.00 and 15.00
    98.9% of all bookings were made online
"The 500,000 seats for GBP1* sale continues until midnight Thursday so while

busiest ever week".

 The cost of jet fuel accounted for approximately 39% and 34% of Ryanair's total operating expenses in the fiscal 
years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively (in each case, this accounts for costs after giving effect to the 
Company's fuel hedging activities but excludes de-icing costs, which accounted for approximately 1% of total fuel 
costs in each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010). Jet fuel costs experienced substantial variance 
in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010. The future availability and cost of jet fuel cannot be predicted 
with any degree of certainty, and Ryanair's low-fares policy limits its ability to pass on increased fuel costs to 
passengers through increased fares. Jet fuel prices are dependent on crude oil prices, which are quoted in U.S. 
dollars. If the value of the U.S. dollar, which has been depressed (in historical terms) in recent years, rises against 
the euro, Ryanair's fuel costs, expressed in euro, may increase even absent any increase in the U.S. dollar price of 
crude oil. Ryanair has also entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against some currency 
fluctuations. See "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Foreign Currency Exposure 
and Hedging."
 Ryanair has historically entered into arrangements providing for substantial protection against fluctuations in fuel 
prices, generally through forward contracts covering periods of up to 18 months of anticipated jet fuel requirements. 
Ryanair (like many other airlines) has, in more recent periods, entered into hedging arrangements on a much more 
selective basis. As of July 22, 2011, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet kerosene) contracts covering 
approximately 90% of its estimated requirements for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012 at prices equivalent to 
approximately $820 per metric ton. In addition, as of July 22, 2011, Ryanair had entered into forward jet fuel (jet 
kerosene) contracts covering approximately 20% of its estimated requirements for the first quarter of the fiscal year 
ending March 31, 2013 at prices equivalent to approximately $1,035 per metric ton, and had not entered into any jet 
fuel hedging contracts with respect to its expected fuel purchases beyond that quarter. See "Item 3. Key 
Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel Availability Affect the 
Company's Results and Increase the Likelihood that the Company May Incur Losses" and "Item 11. Quantitative 
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Fuel Price Exposure and Hedging" for additional information on 
recent trends in fuel costs and the Company's related hedging activities, as well as certain associated risks. See 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -28-
also "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Fiscal Year 2011 Compared with Fiscal Year 2010-
Fuel and Oil."
 The following table details Ryanair's fuel consumption and costs for scheduled operations (i.e. it excludes costs 
related to de-icing) after giving effect to the Company's fuel hedging activities for fiscal years ended March 31, 
2011, 2010 and 2009. The excluded de-icing costs amounted to EUR10.9 million, EUR11.6 million, and EUR9.7 
million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. De-icing costs, which are costs 
incurred for the labor and anti-freeze used to de-ice aircraft, have increased significantly in recent years as the 
Company's route network and number of sectors flown have increased.

 INSURANCE
 Ryanair is exposed to potential catastrophic losses that may be incurred in the event of an aircraft accident or 
terrorist incident. Any such accident or incident could involve costs related to the repair or replacement of a 
damaged aircraft and its consequent temporary or permanent loss from service. In addition, an accident or incident 
could result in significant legal claims against the Company from injured passengers and others who experienced 
injury or property damage as a result of the accident or incident, including ground victims. Ryanair maintains 
aviation third-party liability insurance, passenger liability insurance, employer liability insurance, directors and 
officers liability insurance, aircraft insurance for aircraft loss or damage, and other business insurance in amounts 
per occurrence consistent with industry standards. Ryanair believes its insurance coverage is adequate, although 
not comprehensive. There can be no assurance that the amount of such coverage will not need to be increased, 
that insurance premiums will not increase significantly or that Ryanair will not be forced to bear substantial losses 
from accidents. Ryanair's insurance does not cover claims for losses incurred when, due to unforeseen events, 
airspace is closed and aircraft are grounded, such as the airspace closures described on page 48, which resulted 
from volcanic ash in the northern European airspace during April and May 2010.
 The cost of insurance coverage for certain third-party liabilities arising from "acts of war" or terrorism increased 
dramatically as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. In the immediate aftermath, aircraft liability war 
indemnities for amounts above $50 million were, in the absence of any alternative coverage, provided by the Irish 
Government at pre-September 11, 2001 levels of coverage on the basis of a per-passenger surcharge. In March 
2002, once such coverage was again commercially available, Ryanair arranged coverage to replace that provided 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -28-
by the government indemnity. The replacement insurance coverage operated on the basis of a per-passenger 
surcharge with an additional surcharge based on hull values. Ryanair's insurers have indicated that the scope of the 
Company's current war-related insurance coverage may exclude certain types of catastrophic incidents, which may 
result in the Company seeking alternative coverage. Ryanair to date has passed increased insurance costs on to 
passengers by means of a special "insurance levy" on each ticket.
 During the 2006 fiscal year, Ryanair established Aviation Insurance (IOM) Limited ("AIL"), a wholly owned 
insurance company subsidiary, to provide the Company with self-insurance as part of its ongoing risk-management 
strategy. AIL underwrites a portion of the Company's aviation insurance program, which covers not only the 
Company's aircraft but also its liability to passengers and to third parties. AIL reinsures virtually all of the aviation 
insurance risk it underwrites with recognized third parties in the aviation reinsurance market, with the amount of 
AIL's maximum aggregate exposure not currently subject to such reinsurance agreements being equal to 
approximately $15.75 million. In addition to aviation insurance, AIL has underwritten most of the single trip travel 
insurance policies sold on Ryanair.com since February 1, 2011.
 Council Regulation (EC) No. 2027/97, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No. 889/2002, governs air carrier 
liability. This legislation provides for unlimited liability of an air carrier in the event of death or bodily injuries suffered 
by passengers, implementing the Warsaw Convention of 1929 for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to 
Transportation by Air, as amended by the Montreal Convention of 1999. Ryanair has extended its liability insurance 
to meet the appropriate requirements of the legislation. See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to 
the Airline Industry-The Company Faces the Risk of Loss and Liability" for information on the Company's risks of 
loss and liability.

 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") has previously announced an intention to return capital to shareholders by 
way of a combination of share buybacks and dividends. The Company today announces that on 7 July 2015 it 
purchased for cancellation a total of 222,700 ordinary shares of nominal value EUR0.00635 each in the capital of 
the Company ("Ordinary Shares").
 The Ordinary Shares repurchased have been repurchased through Citigroup Global Markets Limited ("Citigroup")

August 2015, Citigroup will make its trading decisions in relation to Ryanair's Ordinary Shares repurchased under 
the buy-back programme independently of, and uninfluenced by, Ryanair. Any such acquisitions will be effected 
within certain pre-set parameters, and in accordance with both Ryanair's general authority to repurchase shares 
and Chapter 9 of the Listing Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange.
 Following the cancellation of the Ordinary Shares repurchased on 7 July 2015, the Company will have 
1,359,005,115 Ordinary Shares in issue. To the extent that further Ordinary Shares are repurchased under the 
programme, these shares will also be cancelled.

Directors are now seeking to put this authority in place, and may in future years seek the renewal of such 
authority in line with established market practice.

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES Q1 NET PROFIT OF EUR139m
 TRAFFIC GROWS 18% TO 21m -- F.Y. GUIDANCE UNCHANGED AT EUR400m.
 Ryanair, Europe's largest passenger airline today (July 25) announced a Q1 net profit of EUR139m a slight 
increase of 1% on Q1 last year. Revenues grew by 29% to EUR1,155m as traffic increased 18% and ave. fares 
rose 11%. Unit costs rose by 14% due to a 49% increase in fuel costs. Excluding fuel, sector length adjusted unit 
costs fell by 1%.

 ------------------------------------  ----------  --------------  ---------
Announcing these results Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
 "Traffic growth in Q1 was flattered by the unnecessary airspace closures in April/ May 2010 (following the Icelandic 
volcanic eruptions) which led to the cancellation of 9,400 flights, and the loss of almost 1.5m passengers. Our 18% 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
traffic growth combined with an 11% rise in ave. fares led to a 29% increase in revenues. Significantly higher 
revenues were largely offset by higher operating costs as fuel rose 49% (by EUR140m), to EUR427m. Despite 
substantially higher fuel costs we recorded a profit after tax of EUR139m, up on Q1 last year. This robust result is 
testimony to the strength of Ryanair's lowest fares/lowest cost model which continues to deliver profit and traffic 
growth despite the recession and high oil prices.
 Ancillary sales grew 22% to EUR248m, somewhat faster than traffic, and amounted to 21% of total revenues. We 
have recently started trials of "reserved seating" for 21 extra legroom seats on selected routes for a fee of EUR10 
per seat. If successful we will roll out reserved seating across more of our network this winter. Unit costs increased 
by 14% as fuel increased 49% to EUR427m. Excluding fuel, sector length adjusted they fell by 1%, as we rigorously 
controlled costs, despite a 2% increase in basic pay, higher Eurocontrol charges, and substantially higher charges 
at Dublin airport.
 Our new routes and bases are performing well. We recently announced our 45(th) base in Manchester which starts 
in October with 2 aircraft/17 routes rising to 4 aircraft/26 routes in summer 2012. A combination of recession and 
competitor capacity cuts continues to create growth opportunities across Europe as airports aggressively compete 
to attract Ryanair.
 We expect Dublin airport's traffic to fall in 2011 (its 4(th) consecutive annual fall), due to the DAA's unjustified 40% 
increase in airport charges, which has led to winter capacity cuts by Ryanair and many other carriers operating to 
Dublin. These higher charges were recently (and correctly) described as "insane" even by Aer Lingus. Traffic at 
Dublin has plummeted by 30% to just over 18m pax in 2010 from its 2007 peak of 24.5m pax. The Irish govt. can 
only reverse this downward spiral and return to tourism and jobs growth when the DAA airport monopoly is broken 
up, and replaced with competing terminals and competing airports which will lead to more competitive airport 
charges and more efficient terminal facilities. We have submitted a proposal to the Irish govt. to deliver 5m extra 
passengers p.a. over the next 5 years to kick start Irish tourism, and generate at least 5,000 much needed jobs in 
the Irish economy. This growth proposal is based on airport charges falling to competitive levels, and the govt. 
scrapping the EUR3 tourist tax and we await the government's response.
 The latest UK Competition Commission's confirmation (of its original 2008 recommendation), that the BAA airport 
monopoly should be forced to sell Stansted and at least one Scottish airport will, we hope, finally end the BAA 's 
policy of using legal manoeuvres to delay this sale. These delaying tactics have not stopped the BAA at Stansted 
overcharging airlines, generating excess monopoly profits, while losing more routes and traffic. The UK govt. should 
force the early sale of Stansted and one of the Scottish airports to allow competition between airports in order to 
deliver better facilities and lower costs for airport users. We intend to shortly launch legal proceedings against BAA 
Stansted, seeking a recovery of the substantial overcharges which Ryanair believes it and other Stansted airlines 
have suffered at the BAA Stansted monopoly's hands in recent years, which have been used to fund Ferrovial's 
(owners of Stansted airport) acquisition and operation of Heathrow.
 Fuel prices remain stubbornly high as spot is trading at $118 per barrel. We are 90% hedged for FY12 at $860 per 
tonne (approx. $86 per barrel), an 18% price increase on last year, but significantly below current prices. We have 
taken advantage of recent price dips to hedge 20% of Q1 FY13 at an ave. price of $1,035 per tonne (approx. $103 
per barrel). High oil prices are forcing competitors to further increase their fuel surcharges and fares which make 
Ryanair's low fares even more attractive. It will also drive further consolidation, and more airlines will exit the 
industry. This will generate growth opportunities for Ryanair because we operate the most fuel efficient aircraft, and 
have the lowest operating costs.
 The recent Brighter Planet survey of the world's 20 largest carriers confirmed that Ryanair was the cleanest 
greenest airline in the world and had the lowest CO2 emissions per passenger mile. Ryanair has invested over 
$8bn in an all new Boeing 737-800 fleet with low CO2 and noise emissions, with an ave. age of just 3 years. This is 
in stark contrast to our high fare, fuel surcharging, flag carrier competitors who continue to operate older, inefficient, 
gas guzzling aircraft.
 In June we signed an MOU with COMAC, the Chinese aircraft manufacturer, to enter discussions on a new 200 
seater shorthaul aircraft for Ryanair that should be available from 2018. We believe this aircraft will be a real 
alternative to the existing duopoly of Boeing and Airbus. Real competition in the aircraft manufacturing industry will 
deliver more choice and lower costs for airlines. We also believe that it will make economic sense for Ryanair to 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
become a 2 aircraft operator if the present Boeing fleet economies can be matched or improved by another aircraft 
manufacturer.
 Our outlook for the remainder of the year remains unchanged. We anticipate traffic in FY12 will grow by 4% 
comprising 10% growth in H1, and then fall by approx. 4% in H2 due to already announced winter capacity cuts. We 
expect average fares in FY12 to rise by up to 12% due to the better mix of new routes and bases, our winter 
capacity cuts, higher competitor fares and fuel surcharges. We anticipate Q2 yields will rise by 12% to 15%. We 
expect operating costs per passenger for FY12 to rise by 13% due to higher oil prices. Excluding fuel, sector length 
adjusted unit costs should rise by just 2% mainly due to Eurocontrol, Dublin airport, and staff cost increases. With 
very limited visibility on H2 bookings or yields at this time, our full year guidance remains unchanged as we expect 
profit after tax for FY12 to be similar to the FY11 result of EUR400m.

                    NO FUEL SURCHARGES AT RYANAIR - GUARANTEED
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline today (Friday, 24th June 2005) had its
prediction confirmed when BA yet again ripped-off its passengers by adding a 4th
fuel surcharge onto their already sky high fares. BA's fuel surcharges will now
increase to GBP16 return on short haul tickets and GBP48 on long haul trips.
Speaking this morning, Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications said:
        "BA has reacted to higher oil prices by continuing to rip-off passengers
         with yet another fuel surcharge, which adds between GBP16 to GBP48 onto the
         price of a return ticket. Why don't BA reduce other costs instead of
         always gouging their passengers? BA's fuel surcharges are now higher
         than most of Ryanair's airfares.
        "Only Ryanair GUARANTEESno fuel surcharge on all of our fares, not now,
         not ever. The only way passengers can guarantee that they won't pay fuel
         surcharges is by booking with Ryanair, Europe's largest and lowest fare
         airline".

11 July 2006
RYANAIR ANNOUNCES REDUCTIONS IN SERVICES TO SWEDEN DUE TO SWEDISH FLIGHT TAX
Ryanair, Europe's no.1 low-fares airline, today (Tuesday, 11th July 2006)
announced significant reductions in its services to and from Sweden. The airline
announced the cancellation of its twice daily service from Stockholm-Vasteras to
London-Luton, a reduction in its Malmo-Sturup to London-Stansted from twice
daily to a daily service and a reduction in its Gothenburg City Airport to
Glasgow-Prestwick service from five weekly flights to three weekly flights.
These reductions in service will be effective from the 28th of October 2006.
Passengers will be re-accommodated on another Ryanair service or, in the case of
Stockholm-Vasteras passengers will also be offered a full reimbursement of their
fare.
Ryanair has taken this decision due to the proposals by the Swedish Government
to introduce a new 94SEK tax, which will effectively add a further 30% to the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Announces Reductions Sweden
average cost of Ryanair's fares.
Announcing the decision at a press conference in Stockholm today, Ryanair's
Deputy Chief Executive, Michael Cawley, said;
    "The Swedish Government is destroying low fare travel for Swedes and for
     those people who want to visit this beautiful country by attempting to push
     up the average cost of Ryanair's fares by over 30%. The introduction of this
     tax will make Swedish tourism uncompetitive when compared with cheaper
     alternatives in Spain, Italy and elsewhere in Europe. Tourism into Sweden
     has grown only due to the introduction of low fares by Ryanair. Last year,
     we carried over 2.4 million passengers to and from Sweden and Ryanair's
     incoming passengers contribute over 2bn SEK to the Swedish economy. The
     volume of this tourism is completely dependent on the existence of low cost
     air access. With the introduction of this tax the Swedish Government is now
     attempting to charge a premium for passengers to visit Sweden over and above
     the cost of visiting all their other destinations in Europe.
    "On the one hand the Finance Minister Per Nuder is claiming that the Swedish
     travel industry must grow and that he intends to invest significant sums of
     money to attract tourists. However, his Government is putting in place
     policies which are destroying tourism and removing all the economic benefits
     which it brings. In addition, he is undermining the ability of Swedish
     industry to compete internationally by making the cost of travel more
     expensive.
    "Finally, his Government is removing the benefit of low cost access which
     Ryanair and other low fare carriers have brought to the country.
    "This is a very sad day for the Swedish consumer and Swedish tourism. We
     hope this Government will see sense and reverse its decision to implement
     this iniquitous tax".

 GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 Liberalization of the EU Air Transportation Market
 Ryanair began its flight operations in 1985, during a decade in which the governments of Ireland and the 
U.K. liberalized the bilateral arrangements for the operation of air services between the two countries. 
In 1992, the Council of Ministers of the EU adopted a package of measures intended to liberalize the 
internal market for air transportation in the EU. The liberalization included measures that allow EU air 
carriers substantial freedom to set air fares, provided EU air carriers greatly enhanced access to routes 
within the EU, and also introduced a licensing procedure for EU air carriers. Beginning in April 1997, EU 
air carriers have generally been able to provide passenger services on domestic routes within any EU 
member state outside their home country of operations without restriction.
 Regulatory Authorities
 Ryanair is subject to Irish and EU regulation, which is implemented primarily by the Department of 
Transport, Tourism and Sport ("DTTAS"), the Irish Aviation Authority ("IAA"), the European Commission, and 
the European Aviation Safety Agency ("EASA"). Management believes that the present regulatory environment 
in Ireland and the EU is characterized by high sensitivity to safety and security issues, which is 
demonstrated by intensive reviews of safety-related procedures, training, and equipment by the national 
and EU regulatory authorities.
 Commission for Aviation Regulation "CAR". The CAR is currently primarily responsible for deciding maximum 
airport charges only at Dublin Airport. See " 3/4 Airport Operations 3/4 Airport Charges" above.
 The CAR also has responsibility for licensing Irish airlines, subject to the requirements of EU law. It 
issues operating licenses under the provisions of EU Regulation 1008/2008 (formerly 2407/92). An operating 
license is an authorization permitting the holder to transport passengers, mail and/or cargo by air. The 
criteria for granting an operating license include, inter alia, an air carrier's financial fitness, the 
adequacy of its insurance, and the fitness of the persons who will manage the air carrier. In addition, in 
order to obtain and maintain an operating license, Irish and EU regulations require that (i) the air 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -32-
carrier must be owned and continue to be owned directly or through majority ownership by EU member states 
and/or nationals of EU member states and (ii) the air carrier must at all times be effectively controlled 
by such EU member states or EU nationals. The CAR has broad authority to revoke an operating license. See 
"Item 10. Additional Information--Limitations on Share Ownership by Non-EU Nationals." See also "Item 3. 
Risk Factors--Risks Related to Ownership of the Company's Ordinary Shares or ADRs-EU Rules Impose 
Restrictions on the Ownership of Ryanair Holdings' Ordinary Shares by Non-EU nationals and the Company has 
Instituted a Ban on the Purchase of Ordinary Shares by Non-EU Nationals" above.
 Ryanair's current operating license became effective on December 1, 1993, and is subject to periodic 
review. The Flight Operations Department is also subject to ongoing review by the IAA, which reviews the 
department's audits, including flight audits, training audits, document audits, and quality audits. 
Ryanair's current Air Operator Certificate No IE 7/94 was issued on January 28, 2014.
 Irish Aviation Authority. The IAA is primarily responsible for the operational and regulatory function 
and services relating to the safety, security and technical aspects of aviation in Ireland. To operate in 
Ireland and the EU, an Irish air carrier is required to hold an air operator's certificate granted by the 
IAA attesting to the air carrier's operational and technical competence to conduct airline services with 
specified types of aircraft. The IAA has broad authority to amend or revoke an air operator's certificate, 
with Ryanair's ability to continue to hold its air operator's certificate being subject to ongoing 
compliance with applicable statutes, rules and regulations pertaining to the airline industry, including 
any new rules and regulations that may be adopted in the future.
 The IAA is also responsible for overseeing and regulating the operations of Irish air carriers. Matters 
within the scope of the IAA's regulatory authority include: air safety; aircraft certification; personnel 
licensing and training; maintenance, manufacture, repair, airworthiness, and operation of aircraft; 
implementation of EU legislation; aircraft noise; aviation security and ground services. Each of the 
Company's aircraft is required to have a Certificate of Airworthiness, which is issued by the IAA. The 
validity of Certificates of Airworthiness is subject to the review by the IAA. Each certificate is 
generally valid for a 12-month period. In March 2009, Ryanair received "Sub-Part (I) approval" from the 
IAA, which gives Ryanair the authority to extend the validity of its certificates, subject to certain 
record checks and physical aircraft inspections being performed by Ryanair's quality department. The 
Company's flight personnel, flight and emergency procedures, aircraft, and maintenance facilities are 
subject to periodic inspections by the IAA. The IAA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including 
the authority to require reports; inspect the books, records, premises, and aircraft of a carrier; and 
investigate and institute enforcement proceedings. Failure to comply with IAA regulations can result in 
revocation of operating certification.
 In July 1999, the IAA awarded Ryanair an air operator's certificate, which is subject to routine audit 
and review, in recognition of Ryanair's satisfaction of the relevant EU requirements for the operation of 
commercial air transport ("EU OPS 1"). The requirements of EU OPS 1 have been incorporated into European 
law as prescribed in Regulation (EEC) 3922/91 and were applied in full on July 16, 2008. All current 
regulatory requirements are addressed in the Ryanair Operations Manual Part A (as amended). The current 
Manual, Issue 3 Revision9, was approved by the IAA on October 31, 2013.
 Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport ("DTTAS") is 
responsible for implementation of certain EU and Irish legislation and international standards relating to 
air transport.
 In June 2005, the Irish Minister for Transport enacted legislation strengthening rights for air 
passengers following the enactment of EU legislation requiring compensation of airline passengers who have 
been denied boarding on a flight for which they hold a valid ticket (Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004), which 
came into force on February 17, 2005. See "Item 3. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Airline Industry-EU 
Regulation on Passenger Compensation Could Significantly Increase Related Costs."
 The European Aviation Safety Agency. EASA is an agency of the EU that has been given specific regulatory 
and executive tasks in the field of aviation safety. EASA was established through Regulation (EC) No. 
1592/2002 of the European Parliament and the Council of July 15, 2002, repealed by Basic Regulation (EC) 
216-2008. The purpose of EASA is to draw-up common standards to ensure the highest levels of safety, 
oversee their uniform application across Europe and promote them at the global level. The EASA formally 
started its work on September 28, 2003, taking over the responsibility for regulating airworthiness, 
maintenance and air crew issues within the EU member states.
 Eurocontrol. The European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation ("Eurocontrol") is an autonomous 
European organization established under the Eurocontrol Convention of December 13, 1960. Eurocontrol is 
responsible for, inter alia, the safety of air navigation and the collection of route charges for en route 
air navigation facilities and services throughout Europe. Ireland is a party to several international 
agreements concerning Eurocontrol. These agreements have been implemented in Irish law, which provides for 
the payment of charges to Eurocontrol in respect of air navigation services for aircraft in airspace under 
the control of Eurocontrol. The relevant legislation imposes liability for the payment of any charges upon 
the operators of the aircraft in respect of which services are provided and upon the owners of such 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -32-
aircraft or the managers of airports used by such aircraft. Ryanair, as an aircraft operator, is primarily 
responsible for the payment to Eurocontrol of charges incurred in relation to its aircraft.
 The legislation authorizes the detention of aircraft in the case of default in the payment of any charge 
for air navigation services by the aircraft operator or the aircraft owner, as the case may be. This power 
of detention extends to any equipment, stores or documents, which may be onboard the aircraft when it is 
detained, and may result in the possible sale of the aircraft.

 (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) to 
(h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty to 
the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 Directive 
2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the lowest 
notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the requirements of

another undertaking then the second option applies.
 (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or 
legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed 
or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a 
full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or 
financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row 
free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
 (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.

 RYANAIR SMASHES WEEKLY BOOKINGS RECORD
 3 MILLION BOOKINGS IN ONE WEEK FOR FIRST TIME IN ITS HISTORY
 Ryanair today (15 Jan) announced that it smashed its weekly bookings record, taking over 3m bookings in 
one week (for the next 20-week period) for the first time in its history. This new weekly 3m bookings 
record is a direct result of Ryanair's low fares and the continuing success of the "Always Getting Better" 
customer experience programme.
 Wednesday (10 Jan) was the busiest day for bookings last week and the most popular destinations for 
customers included winter holidays to Lanzarote and Tenerife and city breaks to Porto, Milan and Naples.
 Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
 "We are delighted to announce this new weekly record of over 3 million bookings made on the Ryanair.com 
website and app last week, the equivalent of:
 --    5 bookings a second
 --    the population of Lithuania
 --    the population of Madrid
 --    more than half of the total passengers Virgin Atlantic carry in an entire year
 To celebrate our record week of bookings, we are releasing seats for sale from just EUR14.99 for travel 
between now and April, which are available for booking until midnight Wednesday (17 Jan). Since these 
amazing low prices will be snapped up quickly, customers should log onto www.ryanair.com and avoid missing 
out."

            ENAC STIFLES COMPETITION BY BANNING RYANAIR'S LOW FARES
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Thursday, 20th April 2006)
spoke out against ENAC for banning the airline's low fares flights on the Rome
(Ciampino) - Alghero route after May 01st. Ryanair has complained to the
European Commission against the abuse of the PSO rules in Italy whereby the
operation of some commercially viable routes is being granted exclusively to
selected Italian carriers in order to funnel more state aid to these airlines.
Ryanair has also applied to the Administrative Court in Rome to ensure that over
10,000 Italian consumers who are already booked to fly on this route after May
1st are not denied travel because of ENAC's anti-competitive favouritism towards
Italian carriers.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs & Company Secretary,
Jim Callaghan, said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC ENAC BANS RYANAIR
        "The Italian Government's attempt to impose a Public Service Obligation
         on this route is ludicrous. Ryanair has already carried 100,000
         passengers on the Rome-Alghero route in its first year of operation with
         fares of less than 40 euro and with no subsidies, which also means that
         the Italian taxpayer is not being gouged either. Air One is also
         offering services from Rome Fiumicino to Alghero. The imposition of a
         PSO is therefore clearly illegal under European law. We are confident
         that the European Commission and the Italian courts will put an end to
         this anti-competitive and illegal behaviour.
        "It is about time ENAC stopped trying to protect Alitalia and other
         Italian carriers and put a stop to illegal state aid. Such aid promotes
         high fares for Italian consumers and inefficient services. We are
         calling on our passengers to log on to www.ryanair.com and send a
         protest letter to Ryanair which we will forward to the Ministry of
         Transport. We are urging passengers to speak out now to ensure that
         Ryanair continues to operate its low fare, No.1 customer service route.
        "We are assuring passengers that we will continue to fight for low
         fares, competition and choice for Italian consumers on the Rome to
         Alghero route".

 RYANAIR CALLS FOR DUBLIN AIRPORT TO TRANSFER ITS EUR1.2BN WHITE ELEPHANT T2 TO
 NAMA
Ryanair cuts Dublin Winter capacity by 15%, as
 Dublin Airport traffic falls to 17m in 2010
Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline, today (8 July) called on the DAA to
 transfer its EUR1.2bn T2 to NAMA and to reverse the up to 40% increases in
 passenger charges at Dublin Airport in 2010, as Dublin Airport traffic continues
 to collapse.  The airline also called on the Govt to scrap its EUR10 tourist tax
 and follow the example of other EU countries, who have scrapped tourist taxes
 and returned to tourism growth.
Ryanair announced that its Dublin base this winter will be cut from 14 aircraft
 (2009) to 12 aircraft (in 2010) and Ryanair will operate less than 850 weekly
 flights from Dublin compared to 1,000 last winter.  These aircraft will be
 switched to other EU countries which have reduced airport charges and scrapped
 Govt tourist taxes, whereas Ireland continues to lose visitors by imposing
 tourist taxes and raising airport charges.
Recent independent analysis shows that the UK and Ireland, the two remaining EU
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Cuts Dublin Winter Capacity by 15%
 countries with tourist taxes, continue to suffer traffic declines, while most
 other European countries have returned to growth in 2010.  The Irish Govt's
 argument that Ireland's tourism decline is "due to the recession" is disproved
 by Ryanair's continuing rapid growth, and the return to growth of most other EU
 airports.  Since the Irish Govt imposed the EUR10 passenger tax in April 2009,
 traffic at Dublin Airport has fallen by some 30% from 23.5m in 2008 to under 17m
 in 2010, which is less than 2004 traffic levels at Dublin.  In just two years
 Dublin airport has lost over 7 years of hard won traffic growth.
The situation at Dublin Airport continues to worsen daily.  While Terminal 1
 (with the addition of Pier D) is now capable of handling 30 million passengers
 p.a., traffic in 2010 will be less than 17m. Dublin's current traffic can be
 easily handled in half the capacity of the existing terminal.  Yet Dublin
 Airport has wasted EUR1.2bn in developing T2 and its associated facilities (which
 is 5 times more than the DAA's original "EUR170m to EUR200m" budget).  The DAA now
 proposes to open this EUR1.2bn white elephant in November, so that it can claim up
 to 40% price increases which the Dept of Transport ordered the Aviation
 Regulator to approve in order to protect the viability of the DAA.  This means
 that Ryanair, Cityjet and Aer Arann passengers using the existing Terminal 1
 will now be paying up to 40% higher airport charges to subsidise those few
 passengers using the white elephant T2.  The DAA now expects Ryanair passengers
 to pay for Terminal 2, despite the fact that they'll never use it.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said today:
"Ryanair believes that T2 should be transferred to NAMA which is a Govt vehicle
 for working out the debts of reckless property developers, as Ryanair believes
 that T2 was the single most reckless, expensive and unnecessary property
 development of the entire Celtic tiger years.
"The DAA claims that T2 is a statement about modern Ireland and they are
 absolutely correct.  This building is massively oversized, over specified, and
 totally unneeded at Dublin Airport, where the existing terminal can handle 30m
 passengers p.a., yet traffic this year will be less than 17m passengers.  Dublin
 Airport passengers are now being asked to pay up to 40% higher airport charges,
 to fund a reckless property development, which the DAA originally promised to
 build for between EUR170m to EUR200m, but which has finally cost almost EUR1.2bn, a
 fivefold overrun.
"T2 is the most perfect example of Ireland's recent property bubble.  It is
 badly designed, badly located, massively oversized and effectively bankrupt.  By
 wasting EUR1.2bn on this unnecessary facility, despite the opposition of its
 airline users, the DAA now has a building that it doesn't need, can't pay for,
 and yet it proposes to open it in November and force all passengers to subsidise
 it, even those passengers who don't use it.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Cuts Dublin Winter Capacity by 15%
"The damage being done to Irish tourism by this reckless EUR1.2bn white elephant
 cannot be overstated.  Since the Govt introduced its EUR10 tourist tax in April
 2009, traffic and tourism have slumped.  In the face of this traffic collapse,
 the DAA is now - with the support of the Dept of Transport - imposing price
 increases of up to 40% on passengers to pay for a reckless terminal building
 they don't need and won't use.  These higher costs have now made the Irish
 airports totally uncompetitive, which is why traffic to Ireland continues to
 collapse, while traffic growth has returned to most other European airports.
"Ryanair believes that the only way out of this mess is for the Irish Govt to
 scrap its EUR10 tourist tax, as the Dutch and Belgians have already, and for the
 DAA to transfer the EUR1.2bn T2 white elephant to NAMA, which would allow the DAA
 to reverse these 40% passenger cost increases, make Dublin Airport competitive,
 and begin the process of reversing the damage done to tourism by the Govt's EUR10
 tourist tax and the DAA's reckless property development.  Terminal 2 is a
 gold-plated white elephant.  NAMA is now Ireland's home for white elephants and
 so T2 belongs in NAMA.  Who knows, in years to come some property developer
 might convert it into a concert venue, a hotel, or flats and apartments, since
 it will never be needed for passengers at Dublin Airport, because passengers at
 Dublin Airport could never pay for the EUR1.2bn which the DAA have recklessly
 wasted on T2, a fivefold overrun on its original EUR170m to EUR200m budget."

 RYANAIR & BOEING FINALISE FIRM ORDER FOR 175 NEW 737-800 AIRCRAFT
 OVER 100M RYANAIR PAX P.A. & 3,000 NEW JOBS
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra-low-cost carrier (ULCC), today (19 June) finalised a firm order with Boeing for 175 new 
737-800 aircraft in a deal worth $15.6 billion at current list prices, which will allow Ryanair to grow its fleet to more 
than 400 aircraft, serving more than 100m passengers p.a. across Europe by the end of the delivery stream in FY 
2019.
 The deal, which was originally announced as a commitment in March, is Boeing's largest ever firm aircraft order 
from a European airline and the largest industrial order in the history of the Irish State and was concluded by 
Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, and Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and chief executive, Ray Conner, at 
a ceremony today at the Paris Air Show.
 These 175 new Boeing aircraft will create more than 3,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers at 
Ryanair's growing number of aircraft bases across Europe and will allow Ryanair to grow by about 5% p.a. over the 
next five years, taking Ryanair's traffic to over 100m p.a. passengers by March 2019.
 Ryanair's order will also sustain thousands of skilled manufacturing jobs in Boeing and its supplier companies and 
represents the largest ever capital investment by an Irish company in U.S. manufacturing and U.S. jobs. The first of 
these new Boeing aircraft is due for delivery in September 2014 and a senior Ryanair working group is continuing to 
evaluate the benefits of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft, which enters service in 2017.
 Announcing the order, Ryanair CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
 "Ryanair is pleased to finalise this firm order with Boeing to purchase 175 new 737-800 jets, which will expand our 
fleet to over 400 units, creating over 3,000 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers, while allowing us to grow 
our traffic over the next 5 years to 100 million passengers p.a.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR & BOEING FINALISE ORDER
 Ryanair is proud to buy Boeing, who make great aircraft and the 737-800 has been the foundation of Ryanair's 
recent successful growth due to its great engineering and phenomenal reliability. These 175 new airplanes will 
enable us to lower costs and airfares even further, thereby widening Ryanair's price leadership over all other 
airlines in Europe. They provide Ryanair with the additional capacity to exploit substantial growth opportunities that 
now exist as many of Europe's flag and regional airlines are restructuring and are reducing their short-haul 
operations.
 Ryanair operates the largest fleet of Boeing airplanes in Europe, and this firm order for 175 aircraft will enable 
Ryanair to grow by offering more competition, lower prices, and better choice to passengers right across Europe. 
Ryanair is proud to be investing in high-quality US manufacturing and jobs."
 Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO, Ray Conner, said:
 "We are delighted to finalise this order, it is testament to the value that the Next-Generation 737 family brings to 
Ryanair. As the most efficient, reliable, large single-aisle airplane flying today, the Next-Generation 737 has been 
and will continue to be the cornerstone of the Ryanair fleet. I could not be more proud to see the partnership 
between Ryanair and The Boeing Company extended for the years to come."

 RYANAIR PARTNERS WITH GOOGLE FLIGHT SEARCH
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today (22 Jan) announced that its low fares are now 
available on Google Flight Search, allowing even faster access to its 1,600 routes and ensuring Google 
Flight Search users can see just how much cheaper Ryanair's fares are compared to every other European 
airline.
 Using Google Flight Search, customers in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain (as 
well as Canada and the USA) can quickly find and compare flights to and from any of Ryanair's 186 airports 
in Europe and North Africa, view prices in their local currency and then book these low fares directly 
with Ryanair.
 Google's Flight Search feature also allows users to:
 --    explore possible destinations and view live ticket prices by surfing on an interactive map
 --    browse and filter flights by price, airline, flight duration or date selector
 --    see a simple list of the most relevant flights, which are listed in order of price.
 Ryanair's partnership with Google Flight Search is the latest in a series of new digital innovations as 
Ryanair continues to improve its industry leading customer service, including a new Ryanair.com homepage 
and booking flow and a "My Ryanair" customer registration system, with mobile boarding passes, business 
and family products, a new mobile app and an entire Ryanair.com website overhaul to follow in the coming 
weeks and months.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "Ryanair is pleased to announce our partnership with Google Flight Search which will dramatically change 
how Europe's passengers select and book their flights. Customers can now view Ryanair's lowest fares on 
Google Flight Search, browsing by country, date or flight duration and can book these low fares directly 
on Ryanair.com through Google Flight Search. This is the latest digital innovation we have rolled out and 
will be followed in early 2014 by mobile boarding passes, an improved app and a brand new Ryanair.com 
website."
 Google's David Robles said:
 "Research suggests that users tend to visit around twenty different sites before they book a flight. 
Google wants to help improve the travel experience by drastically reducing the time wasted on researching 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR PARTNERS WITH GOOGLE FLIGHT SEARCH
and booking flights. Google Flight Search is fast, easy to use and interactive so business people, 
parents, and star crossed lovers can quickly pay for their travel and get back to their work, parenting or 
pining. We want to give users as many flight options as possible, so introducing Ryanair, which is 
Europe's largest airline, to the Google Flight Search family is very exciting."

                         BIGGEST EVER RYANAIR SEAT SALE
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline today (Monday, 11th July 2005)
announced its biggest ever seat sale of 3 million flights (equivalent to 1
entire month of Ryanair passenger bookings) across Europe from GBP0.99*. Seats can
be booked immediately on www.ryanair.com for travel between 1st September 2005
and 25th March 2006.
Speaking this morning, Ryanair Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, said:
        "Ryanair is lowering its fares in this biggest ever 3 million seat sale
         to ensure that passengers keep on flying. Last week's appalling attacks
         in London must not be allowed to succeed in their twisted goal of
         paralysing us with "fear, terror and panic." The best way for all of us
         to make our stand against these acts is to continue to travel. Travel is
         essential for our economy and tourism industry and Ryanair is today
         lowering 3 million fares in its biggest ever seat sale to ensure we can
         all do our part to fight back".

 Ryanair celebrated its Scottish growth and 3 new business routes by releasing 100,000 seats for sale across its 
European network, at prices from GBP19.99 for travel in August, September and October. These low fare seats are 
available for booking until midnight Monday (7 July). Ryanair's new Scottish routes go on sale on the Ryanair.com 
website tomorrow at fares from just GBP19.99, which are almost half of BA's and 40% cheaper than Easyjet's.
 In Edinburgh today, Ryanair's Chief Commercial Officer, David O'Brien said:
 "Ryanair is pleased to launch three new Scottish routes, between Edinburgh and London, Glasgow and London, 
and Glasgow and Dublin, starting this October, with three daily return flights on each route at fares starting from just 
GBP19.99, which are half of BA's fares and 40% cheaper than Easyjet's, in response to strong demand for 
Ryanair's low fares from Scottish consumers and business customers, and increased competition between Scottish 
airports. Ryanair will also open a new base at Glasgow International this winter, with 7 new routes and will deliver 
more than 500,000 new customers through Scottish airports this year.
 Scottish consumers already choose Ryanair for our low fares, industry leading customer service and great route 
choice. Now they can also book their flights on our improved website, carry a free small 2nd carry-on bag, enjoy 
allocated seats, avail of our recently announced new Family Extra service, and use their personal electronic devices 
at all stages of their flight, making Ryanair the ideal choice for families and friends. We also have a new app and 
business product coming soon, as Ryanair continues to deliver so much more than just the lowest fares.
 However, Scotland cannot fulfil its true tourism potential until Air Passenger Duty is removed and we would urge 
Scotland to follow the example of Ireland, where Ryanair has launched 21 new routes and will deliver over 1.2m 
new customers this year, in response to the Irish Government's welcome decision to scrap APD. Regardless of the 
outcome of the referendum, Scotland cannot unlock its full potential until APD is repealed."

 hedging contracts with respect to its expected fuel purchases beyond that period.
 While these hedging strategies can cushion the impact on Ryanair of fuel price increases in the short term, in the 
medium to longer-term, such strategies cannot be expected to eliminate the impact on the Company of an increase 
in the market price of jet fuel. The unrealized gains on outstanding forward agreements at March 31, 2014 and 
2013, based on their fair values, amounted to EUR17.2 million and EUR34.9 million (gross of tax), respectively. 
Based on Ryanair's fuel consumption for the 2014 fiscal year, a change of $1.00 in the average annual price per 
metric ton of jet fuel would have caused a change of approximately EUR2.0 million in Ryanair's fuel costs. See 
"Item 3. Key Information-Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Company-Changes in Fuel Costs and Fuel Availability 
Affect the Company's Results and Increase the Likelihood that the Company May Incur Losses."
 Under IFRS, the Company's fuel forward contracts are treated as cash-flow hedges of forecast fuel purchases for 
risks arising from the commodity price of fuel. The contracts are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet and are 
re-measured to fair value at the end of each fiscal period through equity to the extent effective, with any 
ineffectiveness recorded through the income statement. The Company has considered these hedges to be highly 
effective in offsetting variability in future cash flows arising from fluctuations in the market price of jet fuel because 
the jet fuel forward contracts typically relate to the same quantity, time, and location of delivery as the forecast jet 
fuel purchase being hedged and the duration of the contracts is typically short. Accordingly, the quantification of the 
change in expected cash flows of the forecast jet fuel purchase is based on the jet fuel forward price, and in the 
2014 fiscal year, the Company recorded no hedge ineffectiveness within earnings. The Company has recorded no 
level of ineffectiveness on its jet fuel hedges in its income statements to date. In the 2014 fiscal year, the Company 
recorded a positive fair-value adjustment of EUR15.0 million (net of tax) within accumulated other comprehensive 
income in respect of jet fuel forward contracts, and in the 2013 fiscal year, the Company recorded a positive fair-
value adjustment of EUR30.6 million (net of tax) within accumulated other comprehensive income.
 FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE AND HEDGING
 In recent years, Ryanair's revenues have been denominated primarily in two currencies, the euro and U.K. pound 
sterling. The U.K. pound sterling and the euro accounted for approximately 25% and 63%, respectively, of Ryanair's 
total revenues in both the 2014 and 2013 fiscal years. As Ryanair reports its results in euro, the Company is not 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -59-
exposed to any material currency risk as a result of its euro-denominated activities. Ryanair's operating expenses 
are primarily denominated in euro, U.K. pounds sterling and U.S. dollars. Ryanair's operations can be subject to 
significant direct exchange rate risks between the euro and the U.S. dollar because a significant portion of its 
operating costs (particularly those related to fuel purchases) is incurred in U.S. dollars, while none of its revenues 
are denominated in U.S. dollars. Appreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar positively impacts Ryanair's 
operating income because the euro equivalent of its U.S. dollar operating costs decreases, while depreciation of the 
euro against the U.S. dollar negatively impacts operating income. It is Ryanair's policy to hedge a significant portion 
of its exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro. From time to time, Ryanair 
hedges its operating surpluses and shortfalls in U.K. pound sterling. Ryanair matches certain U.K. pound sterling 
costs with U.K. pound sterling revenues and may choose to sell any surplus U.K. pound sterling cash flows for euro.
 Hedging associated with the income statement. In the 2014 and 2013 fiscal years, the Company entered into a 
series of forward contracts, principally euro/U.S. dollar forward contracts to hedge against variability in cash flows 
arising from market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates associated with its forecast fuel, maintenance and 
insurance costs and euro/U.K. pound sterling forward contracts to hedge certain surplus U.K. pound sterling cash 
flows. At March 31, 2014, the total unrealized loss relating to these contracts amounted to EUR51.2 million, 
compared to a EUR47.4 million unrealized gain at March 31, 2013.
 Under IFRS, these foreign currency forward contracts are treated as cash-flow hedges of forecast U.S. dollar and 
U.K. pound sterling purchases to address the risks arising from U.S. dollar and U.K. pound sterling exchange rates. 
The derivatives are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet and are re-measured to fair value at the end of each 
reporting period through equity to the extent effective, with ineffectiveness recorded through the income statement. 
Ryanair considers these hedges to be highly effective in offsetting variability in future cash flows arising from 
fluctuations in exchange rates, because the forward contracts are timed so as to match exactly the amount, 
currency and maturity date of the forecast foreign currency-denominated expense being hedged. In the 2014 fiscal 
year, the Company recorded a negative fair-value adjustment of EUR86.3 million (net of tax) within accumulated 
other comprehensive income in respect of these contracts, as compared to a negative adjustment of EUR42.3 
million in the 2013 fiscal year.
 Hedging associated with the balance sheet. In prior years, the Company entered into a series of cross currency 
interest rate swaps to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates of US dollar-denominated 
floating rate borrowings, together with managing the exposures to fluctuations in interest rates on these US dollar-
denominated floating rate borrowings. Cross currency interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert a portion of 
the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated debt to euro and floating rate interest exposures into fixed rate exposures 
and are set so as to match exactly the critical terms of the underlying debt being hedged (i.e. notional principal, 
interest rate settings, re-pricing dates). These are all classified as cash-flow hedges of the forecasted U.S. dollar 
variable interest payments on the Company's underlying debt and have been determined to be highly effective in 
achieving offsetting cash flows. Accordingly, no ineffectiveness has been recorded in the income statement relating 
to these hedges.
 At March 31, 2014, the fair value of the cross currency interest rate swap agreements relating to this U.S. dollar-
denominated floating rate debt was represented by a loss of EUR25.9 million (gross of tax) compared to a loss of 
EUR11.7 million in fiscal 2013. In the 2014 fiscal year, the Company recorded a negative fair-value adjustment of 
EUR12.4 million (net of tax), compared to a loss of EUR3.7 million in fiscal 2013, within accumulated other 
comprehensive income in respect of these contracts.
 Hedging associated with capital expenditures. During the 2014 and 2013 fiscal years, the Company also entered 
into a series of euro/U.S. dollar contracts to hedge against changes in the fair value of aircraft purchase 
commitments under the Boeing contracts, which arise from fluctuations in the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rates. 
There were no such contracts in effect at March 31, 2013. At March 31, 2014, the total unrealized loss relating to 
these contracts amounted to EUR15.0 million.
 Under IFRS, the Company generally accounts for these contracts as either cash-flow hedges or fair-value hedges. 
Fair-value hedges are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value. Any gains or losses arising on these instruments, 
as well as the related gain or loss on the underlying aircraft purchase commitment, are recorded in the balance 
sheet. Any related ineffectiveness is measured by the amount by which these adjustments to earnings do not 
match. Cash-flow hedges are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet and are re-measured to fair value at the 
end of the financial period through equity to the extent effective, with any ineffectiveness recorded through the 
income statement. The Company has found these hedges to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -59-
value of the aircraft purchase commitments arising from fluctuations in exchange rates because the forward 
exchange contracts are always for the same amount, currency and maturity dates as the corresponding aircraft 
purchase commitments.
 At March 31, 2014, the total unrealized losses relating to these contracts amounted to EUR15.0 million, while at 
March 31, 2013 unrealized gains amounted to EURnil. Under IFRS, the Company recorded fair-value adjustments 
of EUR13.1 million and fair-value adjustments of EURnil for cash-flow hedges in the 2014 and 2013 fiscal years, 
respectively. No amounts were recorded for such fair-value hedges from other accumulated comprehensive income 
in the 2014 and 2013 fiscal years.
 Holding other variables constant, if there were an adverse change of 10% in relevant foreign currency exchange 
rates, the market value of Ryanair's foreign currency contracts outstanding at March 31, 2014 would decrease by 
approximately EUR294.0 million (net of tax), all of which would ultimately impact earnings when such contracts 
mature.
