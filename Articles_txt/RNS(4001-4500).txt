Ryanair Holdings plc
 Interim Management Report
Introduction
This financial report for the six month period ended September 30, 2010 meets
 the reporting requirements pursuant to the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC)
 Regulations 2007 and Transparency Rules of the Republic of Ireland's Financial
 Regulator and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's
 Financial Services Authority.
This interim management report includes the following:
·       Reconciliation of results for the period under International Financial
 Reporting Standards ("IFRS") to adjusted results for the half-year period and
 quarter ended September 30, 2010;
·       Principal risks and uncertainties relating to the remaining six months
 of the year;

Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -12-
·       Post balance sheet events.
Results of operations for the six month period ended September 30, 2010 compared
 to the six month period ended September 30, 2009, including important events
 that occurred during the half-year, are set forth in the Operating and Financial
 review on pages 10-14.
Reconciliation of results for the period under IFRS to adjusted results for the
 half year period and quarter ended September 30, 2010
The unaudited condensed consolidated interim income statement for the half-year
 period and quarter ended September 30, 2010, as set forth on pages 5 and 6 of
 this half-yearly financial report, presents the results for the periods
 separately between pre-exceptional and exceptional items.  Certain items are
 presented separately, as exceptional items, which, by virtue of their size or
 incidence, are unusual in the context of the Groups's ongoing core operations,
 as we believe this presentation represents the underlying business more
 accurately and reflects the manner in which investors typically analyse the
 results.

Body
 As disclosed in note 1 - basis of preparation, the annual consolidated financial
 statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with International
 Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') as issued by the International Accounting
 Standards Board and as adopted by the European Union ('EU').  The condensed
 consolidated interim financial statements included in this half-yearly financial
 report have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, "Interim Financial
 Reporting," as adopted by the EU.
Our responsibility
Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed
 consolidated interim financial statements in the half-yearly financial report,
 based on our review.
Scope of review
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review
 Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information
 Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity issued by the Auditing
 Practices Board for use in Ireland and the UK.  A review of interim financial
 information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for
 financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review
 procedures.  A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
 accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -15-
 consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware
 of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.  Accordingly,
 we do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe
 that the condensed consolidated interim financial statements in the half-yearly
 financial report for the six months ended September 30, 2010 are not prepared,
 in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted by the EU, the
 Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and the Transparency Rules
 of the Republic of Ireland's Financial Regulator and the Disclosure and
 Transparency Rules of the UK FSA.

 (effective dates are dealt with on a standard-by-standard basis).
Exceptional items
 The Company presents certain items separately, which are unusual, by virtue of
 their size and incidence, in the context of our ongoing core operations, as we
 believe this presentation represents the underlying business more accurately and
 reflects the manner in which investors typically analyse the results.  In the
 current period we have presented the estimated costs relating to the closure of
 European air space due to the Icelandic volcanic ash disruptions as an
 exceptional item.  In the prior period comparative we have presented the
 impairment of our investment in Aer Lingus separately because of the unusual
 nature of these items.  Any amounts deemed "exceptional" for management
 discussion and analysis purposes have been classified for the purposes of the
 IFRS income statement in the same way as non exceptional amounts of the same
 nature.
2.       Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements,
 estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.  Actual
 results may differ from these estimates.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements
 made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key
 sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -13-
 most recent published consolidated financial statements.
3.         Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to
 quarter, and management expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors
 causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to general
 economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly the
 first half-year typically results in substantially higher revenues and results.
4.          Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the
 half-year ended September 30, 2010 was 12.1% (2009: 10.9%).  The tax charge for
 the half-year ended September 30, 2010 of EUR58.5m (2009: EUR45.9m) primarily
 comprises of a deferred tax charge relating to temporary differences for
 property, plant and equipment recognised in the income statement and the
 utilisation of previous trading losses.
5.           Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most
 recent published consolidated financial statements.  The charge to the income
 statement in the half-year of approximately EUR2.2m (2009: EUR2.8m) is related to
 the fair value of various share options granted in prior periods, which are
 being recognised within the income statement in accordance with employee
 services rendered.
6.            Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its
 business.  The Group does not believe that any such litigation will individually
 or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
 Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, management
 believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not
 expected to materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or
 financial position.
7.            Capital commitments
 At September 30, 2010 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 254 (31 March 2010: 193)
 Boeing 737-800 aircraft.  It also had firm orders for an additional 68 Boeing
 737-800's.  The delivery of these firm order aircraft will increase the fleet
 size (net of planned disposals) to 299 aircraft by March 31, 2013.
8.             Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR116.2m at March 31,
 2010 to EUR166.4m at September 30, 2010 is comprised of a gain of EUR50.2m,
 recognised through other comprehensive income, reflecting the increase in the
 share price from EUR0.73 per share at March 31, 2010 to EUR1.05 per share at
 September 30, 2010.  All impairment losses are required to be recognised in the
 income statement and are not subsequently reversed, while gains are recognised
 through other comprehensive income.
9.            Analysis of operating segment
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares
 airline-related services, including scheduled services, car hire services,
 internet and other related services to third parties across a European route
 network.   The Company operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed
 through a single route scheduling system.
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information
 that internally is provided to Michael O'Leary, CEO, who is the Company's Chief
 Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource allocation decisions the
 CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation
 decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the
 entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in type.  The objective in making
 resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial results,
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -13-
 rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated
 adjusted profit/(loss) after tax of the Company for the year. This measure
 excludes the effects of certain income and expense items, which are unusual, by
 virtue of their size and incidence, in the context of the Company's ongoing core
 operations, such as the costs relating to the closure of airspace in April and
 May 2010 due to the Icelandic volcanic ash disruptions and the impairment of a
 financial asset investment (see reconciliation on page 16).
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company
 has a single reportable segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which
 is flexibly employed across the Company's integrated route network and is
 directly attributable to its reportable segment operations.  In addition, as the
 Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and liabilities
 have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
 Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

 Adjusted profit after tax increased by 17% to EUR451.9m compared to EUR387.0m in the
 half year ended September 30, 2009 primarily due to a 12% increase in average
 fares, and strong ancillary revenues, offset by a 44% increase in fuel costs.
 Total operating revenues increased by 23% to EUR2,181.6m as average fares rose by
 12%.  Ancillary revenues grew by 22%, faster than the 10% increase in passenger
 volumes, to EUR423.8m due to a combination of higher onboard spend (which was
 helped by longer sector length), improved product mix and higher internet
 related revenues.  Total revenue per passenger as a result increased by 12%,
 whilst Load Factors remained flat at 85% during the period.
Total operating expenses rose by 25% to EUR1,636.2m, primarily due to an increase
 in fuel prices, the higher level of activity, and increased operating costs
 associated with the growth of the airline.  Fuel, which represents 40% of total
 operating costs compared to 35% in the comparative period, increased by 44% to
 EUR660.2m due to the increase in the price per gallon paid and a 21% increase in
 the number of hours flown.  Unit costs excluding fuel rose by 4% and including
 fuel they rose by 13%.  Operating margin decreased by 1 point to 25% whilst
 operating profit increased by 21% to EUR545.4m.
Adjusted net margin increased to 21% from 18% at September 30, 2009 for the
 reasons outlined above.
Adjusted earnings per share for the period were 30.47 euro cent compared to
 26.23 euro cent in the previous half year ended September 30, 2009.

 Total cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash of EUR61m, increased by
 EUR212.2m since March 31, 2010 to EUR3,025.6m.  The Group generated cash from
 operating activities of EUR391.9m which partially funded capital expenditure
 incurred during the period.  Capital expenditure of EUR506.0m largely consisted of
 advance aircraft payments for future aircraft deliveries and the delivery of 22
 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft in the half year.  Total debt, net of repayments,
 increased by EUR297.3m to EUR3,253.5m during the period.  Net debt at period end was

 RYANAIR CALLS ON OFT TO CLOSE ITS 'OUT OF TIME' QUERY
Ryanair today (29 Oct) confirmed that it was contacted over the past 4 weeks by
 the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) in relation to a query as to whether or not
 the OFT has jurisdiction to assess Ryanair's minority (29%) stake in Aer Lingus,
 and whether this gives Ryanair any material influence or control over Aer
 Lingus' policy.
Ryanair has made the following points to the OFT:
1.   Even if the OFT had jurisdiction in this case back in June 2007 (as
 suggested then by Aer Lingus), then given the considerable passage of time, the
 OFT is now legally out of time and no longer has jurisdiction.
2.   Both the EU Commission and (under appeal by Aer Lingus) the European Courts
 have already carried out detailed and extensive investigations into Ryanair's
 minority shareholding, and have conclusively ruled that Ryanair lacks influence
 or control over Aer Lingus. EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes confirmed
 in June 2007 that:
"Since Ryanair is not in a position to exert de jure
 or de facto control over Aer Lingus the Commission is not in a position to
 require Ryanair to divest its minority shareholding - which is, by the way, not
 a controlling stake".
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Calls On OFT To Close 'Out Of Time' Query
3.   This out of time query by the OFT, into a failed 2006 merger offer, between
 two non-UK companies (where the issue of influence and control has already been
 investigated and dismissed by the EU Commission and the EU Courts), sets an
 alarming precedent for all current and future mergers involving non UK
 companies.  It would appear that the OFT, by now enquiring into this failed
 merger, some four years after it was launched, and over three years after it was
 prohibited by the EU Commission, intends to second guess or get involved in
 mergers involving non UK Companies long after they have already been approved or
 prohibited by the EU merger authorities, even when these queries only arise more
 than three years after the OFT's own statutory deadline for jurisdiction has
 expired.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"We are surprised at this OFT query into a failed merger offer between two non
 UK companies, some four years after the offer, and some three years after the EU
 Commission has investigated and confirmed that Ryanair has no de jure or de
 facto control over Aer Lingus. We have asked our lawyers to liaise directly with
 the OFT to bring this out of time and unnecessary query to an early conclusion.
 Ryanair also calls on the OFT to close these queries without delay, and without
 wasting time or resources on what is clearly a non-existent issue over which the
 OFT clearly no longer has any jurisdiction."
Ends.
NOTE TO THE EDITORS
The Enterprise Act 2002 requires the OFT to make a reference to the Competition
 Commission within four months from the date of implementation of a merger. Under
 Section 122(4) of the Act this time limit can be extended only if there is a
 legal prohibition on the OFT making a reference. Such prohibition was in place
 until the European Commission's prohibition decision of June 2007 but not while
 the appeal of that decision to the EU's General Court was ongoing. Even if the
 OFT had jurisdiction to investigate, its jurisdiction therefore lapsed four
 months after the European Commission's prohibition decision of June 2007.

The Office of Fair Trading is considering whether a relevant merger situation
 has been created as a result of the acquisition of a minority interest by
 Ryanair Holdings plc in Aer Lingus Group plc and, if so, whether the creation of
 that relevant merger situation has resulted or may be expected to result in a
 substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United
 Kingdom for goods or services that warrants reference to the Competition
 Commission for investigation.
The Office of Fair Trading has released a statement, available on its website,

 The OFT has today started a merger investigation into Ryanair Holdings plc's
 (Ryanair's) acquisition of a minority shareholding in Aer Lingus Group plc (Aer
 Lingus). Ryanair currently owns 29.82 per cent of Aer Lingus.
 The OFT's investigation will have regard to two main questions:
 (i)         whether the OFT has jurisdiction under the Enterprise Act 2002 to
 review the acquisition as a relevant merger situation. This will include
 considering whether Ryanair has the ability to exercise material influence over
 the commercial policy of Aer Lingus (see Note 4)  as well as whether the OFT is
 within the statutory time period available to it to investigate the acquisition
 and, if need be, refer it to the Competition Commission (see Note 5); and
 (ii)        if so, whether the acquisition raises competition issues that give
 rise to a duty to refer the acquisition to the Competition Commission under the
 'substantial lessening of competition' test set out in the Enterprise Act 2002.
 After initially acquiring a minority stake in Aer Lingus in 2006, Ryanair
 mounted a public bid for the entire shareholding in Aer Lingus in October 2006.
 The European Commission investigated the bid and decided to prohibit it in June
 2007.
 Aer Lingus subsequently appealed against the European Commission's decision not
 to order Ryanair to divest its existing minority stake in Aer Lingus. In July
 2010, the European General Court ruled that the European Commission did not have
 the ability to require divestment of minority shareholdings that do not confer
 'decisive influence' for the purposes of the EC Merger Regulation. Separately,
 Ryanair also appealed, unsuccessfully, to the General Court on the grounds that
 the European Commission should not have prohibited its public bid for the entire
 shareholding in Aer Lingus.
 Given the termination of the European Commission investigation and related
 litigation, the OFT is now considering the acquisition.
 The OFT has written to Ryanair seeking information and its views on the
 acquisition. In line with its normal practice, the OFT has today invited
 comments from third parties on the acquisition, to be submitted by 12 November.
NOTES
 1.   Ryanair Holdings plc currently owns 29.82 per cent of Aer Lingus Group plc.
 Ryanair initially acquired a stake in Aer Lingus in late-2006. It mounted a
 public bid for the entire shareholding in Aer Lingus in October 2006. The
 European Commission investigated the public bid and decided to prohibit it in
 June 2007. The General Court ruled in July 2010 that the European Commission
 does not have the ability to examine or require divestment of minority
 shareholdings that do not confer 'decisive influence' for the purposes of the EC
 Merger Regulation - see Note 4).
 2.   The reference test - the OFT has a duty to make a reference to the
 Competition Commission if it believes that it is or may be the case that a
 relevant merger situation has been created and the creation of that situation
 has resulted, or may be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of
 competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or
 services.
 3.  Under the Enterprise Act 2002 a relevant merger situation is created if two
 or more enterprises have ceased to be distinct enterprises; and the value of the
 turnover in the United Kingdom of the enterprise being taken over exceeds GBP70
Office of Fair Trade Merger Update
 million; or as a result of the transaction, in relation to the supply of goods
 or services of any description, a 25 per cent share of supply in the UK (or a
 substantial part thereof) is created or enhanced.
 4.   Under the Enterprise Act 2002 the OFT may treat as a relevant merger
 situation a minority shareholding where that shareholding gives its owner the
 ability materially to influence the behaviour and policy of the target company
 including the target company's strategic direction and commercial objectives. As
 stated in the OFT's Mergers - jurisdictional and procedural guidance(OFT527,
 paragraph 3.15) this is a lower level of control than the 'decisive influence'
 test used by the European Commission under the EC Merger Regulation.
 5.   Under the Enterprise Act 2002 the OFT is able to refer to the Competition
 Commission completed relevant mergers within four months of the merger's

Aer Lingus response to announcement by Office of Fair Trading
Dublin & London, 29 October 2010:  Aer Lingus welcomes today's announcement by
 the Office of Fair Trading (the "OFT") that it intends to investigate Ryanair's
 minority shareholding in Aer Lingus under the UK's merger control legislation.
This investigation follows confirmation by the EU General Court in its decision
 earlier this year that, while the EU Merger Regulation does not give the EU
 Commission power to address such minority shareholdings, individual Member
 States remain free to apply their national competition law to Ryanair's
 shareholding.
Aer Lingus will cooperate in full with the OFT in this investigation.

Commenting on the markets, Vincent Devlin, representing the Investment Manager
 noted:
Fund Performance & Attribution
 During September the Company's NAV underperformed the reference index, although
 the share price outperformed. While the FTSE World Europe ex UK Index gained
 9.6% during September, the Company's NAV gained 9.2% and the share price gained
 13.2%.
Following a weak August, markets rallied in September as concerns over the
 economic environment began to lessen and investors put money backing into
 equities. In this context, Industrial companies performed well as the global
 business cycle remained strong, and rising commodity prices drove strong
 returns in the Basic Materials sector.
BlackRock Grtr Eur Portfolio Update
The Company's relative underperformance during the month was largely caused by
 positions within the Financials and Basic Materials sectors. Positions in Swiss
 banks Credit Suisse and Julius Baer both underperformed as the banking sector,
 as a whole, performed less well than the market. In addition, following a
 strong August, a position in Swiss hearing aid company Sonova detracted as
 headwinds from a strong Swiss Franc concerned investors.
On a more positive note, the Company's holding in Irish airline Ryanair
 continued to perform well, as did a position in Finnish crane manufacturer
 Konecranes, which continues to build upon its strong second quarter earnings
 with a solid order pipeline for the rest of the year. Within the Autos sector,
 positions in Daimler and Finnish winter tyre manufacturer Nokian Renkaat
 performed well, both of which benefit from continued strong demand from the
 emerging market consumer.
Relative to the reference index, the Company ended the period with a higher
 weighting in the Industrials, Consumer Services, Basic Materials, Health Care
 and Consumer Goods sectors and lower relative weighting in the Financials,
 Telecommunications, Utilities and Oil & Gas sectors. At the end of the month,
 the Company was 4% geared.
Outlook
 Our outlook remains positive, despite the well-publicised economic headwinds
 within the region. Europe remains under-owned and valuations continue to look
 compelling on a relative and historic basis. Europe also looks attractive on a
 yield basis with many European companies committing to or confirming dividend
 policies. With European valuations low and many companies holding net cash on
 their balance sheets we have begun to see an increase in M&A activity which we
 would expect to continue in coming months.
We feel it is important to distinguish between the economic situation within
 the region and the outlook for European corporate profitability. In addition,
 Europe offers a number of well managed companies that are able to access the
 strongest areas of global growth through high quality product offerings.

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES CLOSURE OF MARSEILLE BASE
 4 AIRCRAFT, 13 ROUTES, 200 JOBS LOST AT MARSEILLE,
 AS AIRCRAFT AND JOBS
 SWITCH TO SPAIN AND ITALY
Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (13th Oct) announced that it will
 close its only French base at Marseille Airport from Tuesday 11th Jan 2011,
 following the commencement of legal proceedings against Ryanair's Marseille
 base, where all of its 200 pilots and cabin crew work on Irish aircraft (i.e.
 Irish territory) and pay their taxes and social insurance contributions in
 Ireland where they receive their Irish pay.  The four Marseille based aircraft
 (and 200 Ryanair jobs) will now be moved in January to competitor airports in
 Spain, Italy and Lithuania, with the result that 13 Marseille routes will be
 closed from 11th January.  Ryanair will continue to operate 10 routes to/from
 Marseille Airport, on aircraft and crews that are based elsewhere.
Ryanair's base at Marseille and its Flight Crews fully comply with the European
 Directive on Transport Workers which allows all mobile transport workers to pay
 income tax and social insurance in the country they work (which in this case is
 Ireland because they work on Irish registered aircraft which is defined as Irish
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Closure Of Marseille Base
 territory) or where their employer is resident and where they are physically
 paid, which also in Ryanair's case is Ireland.  The French authorities wish to
 take a different view and claim that these mobile (Irish) workers should pay
 income tax and social insurance in France, rather than in Ireland, even though
 this is contrary to EU regulations.
The closure of Ryanair's Marseille base and the loss of these aircraft and jobs
 demonstrates why the European regulations on mobile workers should be respected
 by France and why this attempt by the French authorities to force these mobile
 workers to pay taxes in France, when they are employed on Irish territory and
 paid in Ireland, are doomed to failure. Ryanair has taken a case in the European
 Courts against this French decree which clearly runs counter to EU rules on
 international transport workers.
Speaking today in Marseille, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"We are very disappointed at this decision by the French authorities to initiate
 proceedings against Ryanair's base in Marseille, which complies fully with EU
 regulations for mobile transport workers.  These are not French jobs, but rather
 Irish jobs on Irish aircraft, which are defined by EU regulations as Irish
 territory.  All of these people pay their tax and social insurance, in
 accordance with EU regulations, in Ireland and they remain fully tax compliant.
"Sadly the loss of these 4 aircraft, 200 jobs and 13 routes at Marseille is the
 high price necessary to demonstrate that these are mobile Irish workers, which
 is why they are covered by the EU regulations for mobile transport workers; and
 not by a  local French decree which  Ryanair is currently appealing to the
 European Courts .  This ill-judged legal action has therefore cost Marseille and
 France jobs, foreign investment and lost visitors in circumstances where our
 Marseille base fully complies with EU regulations for transport workers.
"Ryanair remains committed to Marseille Airport and in particular to its low
 cost MP2 Terminal.  Ryanair will now be working with the management of Marseille
 Airport to try to grow other routes and traffic, on aircraft which are based
 overseas, particularly as Ryanair opens up bases elsewhere in Europe.  Sadly the
 loser in all of this will be Marseille Airport, tourism and jobs in the Provence
 region."

 RYANAIR WELCOMES COURT OF APPEAL RULING THAT BAA MONOPOLY CAN NOW BE BROKEN UP
Ryanair, Britain's favourite airline, today (Wed 13th Oct) welcomed the decision
 by the Court of Appeal to overturn the Feb 2010 decision of the Competition
 Appeals Tribunal which upheld an appeal by the BAA airport monopoly against the
 Competition Commission's original Mar 2009 ruling that the BAA airport monopoly
 should be broken up in the interests of competition and a better deal for
 consumers.
Ryanair welcomed the fact that today's decision to dismiss the BAA monopoly's
 appeal against the Competition Commission's decision means that the sale of
 Glasgow and Stansted airports can now proceed, which will promote competition
 and a better deal for airport users and passengers.  The Competition
 Commission's original findings highlighted:
a)         The BAA's monopoly ownership of Edinburgh and Glasgow airports has
 adversely affected competition.
b)         The BAA's monopoly ownership of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted
 airports has adversely affected competition.
c)         The way the BAA has conducted its business has adversely affected
 competition.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Welcomes BAA Court Of Appeal Ruling
d)         The inadequate regulatory regime operated by the CAA has adversely
 affected competition.
Ryanair renewed its call for the early sale of Stansted and Glasgow airports,
 which will pave the way for lower costs, lower fares and will reverse the
 traffic collapse which Stansted Airport in particular has suffered under the BAA
 monopoly's mismanagement in recent years.
Welcoming today's Court of Appeal judgement, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said;
"Today's Court of Appeal ruling to dismiss the BAA's appeal is a great result
 for competition, consumer choice and passengers.  Ryanair has fought long and
 hard for the break-up of the high cost, inefficient BAA airport monopoly, and we
 welcome today's ruling which vindicates the original findings of the Competition
 Commission.
"We hope that Ferrovial, the Spanish owners of the BAA airport monopoly, will
 now accept this Court of Appeal ruling and move quickly to sell Stansted and
 Glasgow airports, so that more competition and a better deal for consumers can
 be ushered in as soon as possible.
"Over the past 3 years, traffic at Stansted Airport has declined from a high of
 24m passengers to just 18m passengers in 2010.  This was entirely due to the
 BAA's high and rising prices, and the hopelessly ineffective regulatory regime
 run by the CAA which was long ago captured by the BAA monopoly.
"Ryanair congratulates the Competition Commission on successfully overturning
 the BAA monopoly's appeal, and we call again for the early disposal of Stansted
 and Glasgow airports, which will transform consumer choice, airport competition
 and will lower air fares for millions of passengers and visitors to the London
 and Scottish airports."

 RYANAIR AGM CALLS FOR EU ACTION TO REFORM EUROPE'S ATC TO END STRIKES AND DELAYS
Promote ATC competition and end failed ATC monopolies
Ryanair today (22nd Sept) at its AGM called on the EU Commission to take action
 to reform Europe's (national monopoly) ATC providers, and open them up to
 competition in order to improve passenger service and end the strikes which have
 caused unnecessary flight delays all summer, in particular within French,
 German, Spanish and UK airspace.
Ryanair condemned the failure of European Governments and their ATC to reform or
 end the repeated strikes, no shows, and work to rules which have delayed
 thousands of flights for millions of passengers across Europe.  These slot
 delays could be avoided if the EU's ATC providers were properly rostered and
 properly managed, instead of being run as bloated, inefficient state owned
 bureaucracies.  European ATC's are a vital service which should not be allowed
 to go on strike.  If they do, then European Governments should replace them with
 military and other substitutes in order to keep Europe's vital airspace open and
 running efficiently.
It's time for Europe to take similar action as Ronald Reagan did in the early
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Calls For EU Action To Reform Europe's ATC
 1980's when U.S. Air Traffic Controllers went on strike (he sacked and replaced
 them).  Europe's national ATC providers should be deregulated and allowed to
 compete against each other.  If, for example, the French go on strike, then the
 British or the Spanish should be allowed to manage French airspace to prevent
 flights being cancelled or delayed and consumers being blackmailed or held to
 ransom.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said today:
"The U.S. ATC service is far more efficient, cheaper and causes far fewer delays
 than Europe's mismanaged, unproductive ATC providers.  Europe's airlines and
 passengers have suffered all summer long, while the German, French and Spanish
 ATC's, have either gone on strike, failed to show up for work, or when at work,
 insist on applying ludicrous work to rule practices which impose totally
 unnecessary flight delays and penalties on Europe's airlines and passengers.
"The European Commission and Parliament keep banging on about passenger rights
 during  flight delays, when in reality most of this summer's flight delays have
 been caused by European Governments abject failure to manage their ATC services,
 with the result that Europe's airlines and passengers are blackmailed by ATC
 strikes, go slows and the feeble management which runs Europe's national ATC
 monopolies.
"These inefficient national ATC monopolies should now be opened up to
 competition (in the same way Europe's airlines were deregulated 20 years ago).
 We must allow the best and most efficient ATC providers to offer their services
 across Europe.  This will ensure that Europe's airlines and passengers are no
 longer held to ransom by striking ATC bureaucrats who think they can simply
 "no-show", strike or  work to rule, whenever it suits them, regardless of the
 impact of their actions on customer airlines or passengers.  We must now let
 competition succeed where these ATC monopolies have failed."
Ends.

 During August the Company's NAV outperformed its reference index, although the
 share price underperformed. The NAV fell 0.8% in Sterling terms and the share
 price decreased by 3.5%. During the same period, the FTSE World Europe ex UK
 Index (net) fell 2.8%.
Despite many positive earnings releases for the second quarter in the European
 region, macro economic factors continued to dominate both sentiment and market
 movements, with most major indices declining. Concerns over the spectre of a
 double-dip recession contributed to this decline, with much of the bad news
 emanating from the US. The Federal Reserve issued a more cautious outlook
BlackRock Grtr Eur Portfolio Update
 statement during the month and US jobless claims continued to remain high.
 Closer to home, the economic situation was decidedly more positive, with
 Germany reporting strong GDP growth for the quarter and Eurozone industrial
 production continued to see positive momentum.
The Company's performance during August was largely driven by strong stock
 selection within the Industrials, Health Care and Consumer Discretionary
 sectors. The second quarter earnings season has been broadly positive in
 Europe, with 60% of companies beating market expectations.
At a stock level, a position in Finnish winter tyre maker Nokian Renkaat
 performed well. The company continues to benefit from strong growth trends in
 the Russian foreign car sales market, and rallied by 9% after significantly
 beating expectations for second quarter earnings in the month. In addition, a
 position in Swiss luxury watch company Swatch performed well after the company
 reported record sales in the first half of the year, with exports out of the
 region boosted across all product lines. We view Swatch as a high quality brand
 with extremely strong penetration in Asia ex Japan, from which the company
 sources 40% of its sales. Positions in Danish pharmaceutical company
 Novo-Nordisk and Swiss hearing aid company Sonova both performed well within
 the Health Care sector relative to the reference index.
Relative to the reference index, the Company ended the period with a higher
 weighting in the Industrials, Consumer Services, Health Care, Oil & Gas and
 Basic Materials sectors and a lower weighting in the Financials, Utilities,
 Technology, Telecoms and Consumer Goods sectors.
The Company had an average gearing of 7.8% during the month, which dragged on
 performance in a falling market. This is a reflection of our positive view on
 the European stock market and high levels of conviction at present.
Outlook
 Our outlook remains positive, despite the well-publicized economic headwinds
 within the region. Europe remains under owned and valuations continue to look
 compelling on a relative and historic basis. Europe also looks attractive on a
 yield basis with many European companies committing to or confirming dividend
 policies.
We do not anticipate a double-dip recession, although we do expect a mid-cycle
 slowdown as economic growth slows. Within this context, European companies can
 perform well, with the corporate profit cycle still recovering and with margins
 expected to reach new heights in 2011.

 RYANAIR WINS SPANISH COURT VICTORY AGAINST SCREENSCRAPER ATRAPALO
Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, today (7th Sep) welcomed its victory in
 the Commercial Court of Barcelona (in a case brought by screenscraper website
 Atrapalo), which confirmed that Ryanair is entitled under the Spanish
 Constitution to exclusively distribute its low fares on www.ryanair.com.
The Spanish Court also ruled that Ryanair's comparative advertisements complied
 with Spanish law. These same ads were previously censored by another Spanish
 court, a decision which Ryanair appealed to the Constitutional Court of Spain.
The Court finally upheld Ryanair's right to defend its exclusive distribution
 policy by publicly addressing screenscrapers in terms such as: "illegal
 sellers", "parasites of the sector" and "dead wood". The Court ruled that
 Ryanair is not allowed to describe screenscrapers as "bastards".
This Spanish court victory is yet another milestone win for Ryanair after
 similar court wins against other screenscrapers in Germany, Ireland, the
 Netherlands and the UK.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Wins Court Victory Against Atrapalo
"This Spanish court victory is another milestone in Ryanair's fight against
 internet screenscrapers and resellers. Websites such as Atrapalo have for too
 long been getting away with unauthorised reselling of Ryanair's flights, with
 the addition of charges which consumers don't pay when they book directly with
 Ryanair.
Ryanair is pleased that the Spanish Court has recognised Ryanair's
 constitutional right to exclusively sell its low fares on www.ryanair.com. This
 policy is at the core of Ryanair's low-cost / low-fare business model and at the
 heart of our ongoing pro-consumer fight against the unauthorised use of
 Ryanair's website.
Genuine price comparison only websites, who wish to present Ryanair's low fares
 information to consumers, as opposed to reselling Ryanair flights with
 additional fees and charges, can enter into a licence agreement with Ryanair to
 provide price comparison only information. If Atrapalo is genuinely interested
 in providing an honest price comparison service, it is welcome to sign up to
 this licence which is subject to a charitable donation of EUR100."

 only one such market guide price published, PROVIDED THAT if there shall not be
 any market guide price published for any particular day then that day shall not
 count as one of the said five business days for the purpose of determining the

 subject to compliance with the requirements of the Acts, a poll shall be taken
 in such manner (including by the use of a ballot, electronic devices, voting
 papers or tickets) as the chairman in his discretion may direct and he may
 appoint scrutineers (who need not be Members) and fix a time and place for
 declaring the result of the poll.  The result of the poll shall be deemed to be

70    Appointment of proxy
Every Member entitled to attend and vote at a general meeting may appoint
 a proxy (or, where Shares are held in different securities accounts more than
 one proxy, but so that the number of proxies appointed shall not exceed the
 number of securities accounts in which Shares are held by that Member) to
 attend, speak and vote on his behalf.  A Member acting as an intermediary on
 behalf of a client may grant a proxy to each of his clients, or to any third
 party designated by a client.  The appointment of a proxy shall be in writing in
 any usual form or in any other form (including in electronic form) which the
 Directors may approve and shall be executed by or on behalf of the appointer (or
 otherwise authenticated in such manner or form as the Directors may approve).
 Any signature on such appointment of a proxy need not be witnessed.  A body
 corporate may execute a form of proxy under its common seal or under the hand of
 a duly authorised officer thereof.  A proxy need not be a Member.  No
 appointment of a proxy shall be valid after twelve months have elapsed from the
 date named in it as the date of its execution.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Replacement: Notice of AGM -2-
72A  Electronic proxy
Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in these Articles, in relation to
 any Shares, the Directors may from time to time permit appointments of proxies
 to be made by electronic means (including without limitation by means of
 Electronic Communication generated and sent by Members to the Company via a
 website for this purpose using identification numbers communicated by or on
 behalf of the Company to each Member) in such manner or form and subject to such
 terms, conditions or restrictions as the Directors may, subject to and in
 accordance with the Acts, determine or approve from time to time in their
 absolute discretion.  Subject as aforesaid, the Company and its Directors,
 Secretary or officers shall not be compelled to accept or receive any instrument
 appointing a proxy in accordance with this Article 72A until such time as the
 Directors shall have advised (pursuant to any terms and conditions of Electronic
 Communication or otherwise) the Members in writing of the manner, form and
 restrictions (if any) by which such appointment may be made. The Directors may
 prescribe the method of determining the time at which any such appointment of a
 proxy is to be treated as received by the Company.  The Directors may treat any
 such appointment which purports to be or is expressed to be sent on behalf of a
 Member as sufficient evidence of the authority of the person sending that
 instruction to send it on behalf of that Member.
For the purposes of Articles 72 and 72A, delivery of the appointment of proxy by
 the Member shall be to such number (including identification number) or address
 (including any number or address used for the purpose of communication by way of
 electronic mail or other Electronic Communication) or by such other means as is
 notified by the Directors to the Members whether by way of note to the notice
 convening the meeting or otherwise.
74    Effect of revocation of a proxy or of an authorisation
A vote given or poll demanded in accordance with the terms of an
 appointment of a proxy or a resolution authorising a representative to act on
 behalf of a body corporate shall be valid notwithstanding the death or insanity
 of the principal or the revocation of the appointment of a proxy or of the
 authority under which the appointment of a proxy was executed or otherwise
 authenticated in a manner approved by the Directors (as the case may be) or of
 the resolution authorising the representative to act or transfer the Share in
 respect of which the appointment of a proxy or the authorisation of the

 and subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, 1990 and the following
 restrictions and provisions:
7.1   The maximum aggregate number of Ordinary Shares authorised to be acquired
 pursuant to this resolution shall not exceed 74.2m Ordinary Shares;
7.2   The minimum price which may be paid for any such share shall be an amount
 equal to the nominal value thereof;
7.3   The maximum price which may be paid for any such share shall be an amount

 day on which there shall be a dealing on the Irish Stock Exchange (or any
 successor thereto) in respect of such shares, the last price of such share as
 published in the Irish Stock Exchange Daily Official List (or any successor
 publication thereto) and, in respect of any business day on which there shall be
 no such dealing, the price which is equal to (x) the mid-point between the high
 and low market guide prices in respect of such shares for such business day as
 published in the Irish Stock Exchange Daily Official List (or any successor
 publication thereto), or (y) the market guide price published if there shall be
 only one such market guide price published, PROVIDED THAT if there shall not be
 any market guide price published for any particular day then that day shall not
 count as one of the said five business days for the purpose of determining the
 maximum price.  If the means of providing the foregoing information as to
 dealings and prices, by reference to which the maximum price is to be
 determined, is altered or is replaced by some other means, then the maximum
 price shall be determined on the basis of the equivalent information published
 by the relevant authority in relation to dealings on the Irish Stock Exchange or
Ryanair Holdings PLC Notice of AGM
 its equivalent.
7.5   Such authority shall expire at the close of business on the earlier of the
 date of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or 15 months from the
 date of the passing of this Resolution, unless previously varied, revoked or
 renewed in accordance with the provisions of Section 215 of the 1990 Act.  The
 Company or any subsidiary may before such expiry enter into a contract for the
 purchase of Ordinary Shares which would or might be wholly or partly executed
 after such expiry and may complete any such contract as if the authority
 conferred hereby had not expired.

 70      Appointment of proxy
Every Member entitled to attend and vote at a general meeting may
 appoint a proxy (or, where Shares are held in different securities accounts more
 than one proxy, but so that the number of proxies appointed shall not exceed the
 number of securities accounts in which Shares are held by that Member) to
 attend, speak and vote on his behalf.  A Member acting as an intermediary on
 behalf of a client may grant a proxy to each of his clients, or to any third
 party designated by a client.  The appointment of a proxy shall be in writing in
 any usual form or in any other form (including in electronic form) which the
 Directors may approve and shall be executed by or on behalf of the appointer (or
 otherwise authenticated in such manner or form as the Directors may approve).
 Any signature on such appointment of a proxy need not be witnessed.  A body
 corporate may execute a form of proxy under its common seal or under the hand of
 a duly authorised officer thereof.  A proxy need not be a Member.  No
 appointment of a proxy shall be valid after twelve months have elapsed from the
 date named in it as the date of its execution.
72A  Electronic proxy
Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in these Articles, in relation to
 any Shares, the Directors may from time to time permit appointments of proxies
 to be made by electronic means (including without limitation by means of
 Electronic Communication generated and sent by Members to the Company via a
Ryanair Holdings PLC Notice of AGM -2-
 website for this purpose using identification numbers communicated by or on
 behalf of the Company to each Member) in such manner or form and subject to such
 terms, conditions or restrictions as the Directors may, subject to and in
 accordance with the Acts, determine or approve from time to time in their
 absolute discretion.  Subject as aforesaid, the Company and its Directors,
 Secretary or officers shall not be compelled to accept or receive any instrument
 appointing a proxy in accordance with this Article 72A until such time as the
 Directors shall have advised (pursuant to any terms and conditions of Electronic
 Communication or otherwise) the Members in writing of the manner, form and
 restrictions (if any) by which such appointment may be made. The Directors may
 prescribe the method of determining the time at which any such appointment of a
 proxy is to be treated as received by the Company.  The Directors may treat any
 such appointment which purports to be or is expressed to be sent on behalf of a
 Member as sufficient evidence of the authority of the person sending that
 instruction to send it on behalf of that Member.
For the purposes of Articles 72 and 72A, delivery of the appointment of proxy by
 the Member shall be to such number (including identification number) or address
 (including any number or address used for the purpose of communication by way of
 electronic mail or other Electronic Communication) or by such other means as is
 notified by the Directors to the Members whether by way of note to the notice
 convening the meeting or otherwise.
74      Effect of revocation of a proxy or of an authorisation
A vote given or poll demanded in accordance with the terms of an
 appointment of a proxy or a resolution authorising a representative to act on
 behalf of a body corporate shall be valid notwithstanding the death or insanity
 of the principal or the revocation of the appointment of a proxy or of the
 authority under which the appointment of a proxy was executed or otherwise
 authenticated in a manner approved by the Directors (as the case may be) or of
 the resolution authorising the representative to act or transfer the Share in
 respect of which the appointment of a proxy or the authorisation of the
 representative to act was given, provided that (a) no intimation in writing of
 such death, insanity, revocation or transfer shall have been received by the
 Company at the Office or at such other address as may be specified in the notice
 of meeting or in the notes thereto at least one hour or such longer period as
 may be specified by the Directors and so notified in the notice of meeting or in
 the notes thereto as aforesaid before the commencement of the meeting or
 adjourned meeting at which the appointment of a proxy is used or at which the
 representative acts and (b) in the case of any such intimation being given in
 electronic form, no such intimation shall have been received by the Company at
 least 24 hours before the commencement of the meeting, or such longer period as
 may be specified by the Directors and so notified in the notice of meeting or in
 the notes thereto as aforesaid before the commencement of the meeting or
Ryanair Holdings PLC Notice of AGM -2-
 adjourned meeting at which the appointment of a proxy is used or at which the
 representative acts.
The Directors may send, at the expense of the Company, by post, by electronic
 means or otherwise, to the Members appointments of a proxy (with or without
 stamped envelopes for their return) for use at any general meeting or at any
 class meeting, either in blank or nominating any one or more of the Directors or
 any other persons in the alternative.  If for the purpose of any meeting
 invitations to appoint as proxy a person or one of a number of persons specified
 in the invitations are issued at the expense of the Company, such invitations
 shall be issued to all (and not to some only) of the Members entitled to be sent
 a notice of the meeting and to vote thereat by proxy.  The accidental omission
 to issue the appointments of proxy herein referred to, or the non-receipt of any
 such invitation by, any Member entitled to receive such invitation shall not
 invalidate the proceedings at any such meeting.

 RYANAIR TO CLOSE BELFAST CITY BASE (1 AIRCRAFT) PROMISED RUNWAY EXTENSION
 DEFERRED... AGAIN
Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (31st Aug) announced that it would
 close its Belfast City Airport base at the end of the current summer schedule on
 Sun 31 October 2010, following the airport's confirmation that the public
 inquiry into the promised runway extension will be further delayed, thereby
 delaying yet again the launch of Ryanair low fare flights from Belfast City
 Airport to destinations all over Europe.
Ryanair regrets that despite repeated promises, the runway extension at Belfast
 City, which was originally scheduled to be delivered in 2008, still has not been
 approved by the Northern Ireland Government, and would now be the subject of a
 delayed public inquiry, which means the runway extension will not be delivered
 until 2012 at the earliest, some 4 years after it was originally promised.
Ryanair, which launched a base in Belfast City in Oct 2007, operates five routes
 to the UK because of the short runway at Belfast City.  Ryanair had planned to
 open up a wide range of low fare European routes from/to Belfast City once the
 promised runway extension was delivered, but this has sadly failed to
 materialise.  Today's closure of Ryanair's Belfast City base means that Belfast
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair to close Belfast City base
 and Northern Ireland tourism will lose up to 1 million passengers annually.
From early in November, Ryanair will switch its one Belfast City based aircraft
 to another European airport, with the loss of 50 Ryanair jobs (all staff will be
 offered relocation elsewhere in the UK or Europe) and the loss of 1 million
 passengers annually, which will result in the loss of up to 1,000 support jobs
 in and around Belfast City Airport.  Sadly passengers to/from all Belfast
 airports will now pay much higher fares to travel to/from the UK with other
 airlines.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"It is very disappointing that the promised runway extension at Belfast City
 Airport has still not materialised more than 3 years after we opened the base at
 Belfast City.  It makes no sense for Ryanair to continue to invest in Belfast
 City, operating restricted routes with less than full payloads between Belfast
 and other UK airports (which suffer a double APD penalty) unless there is clear
 and immediate prospect of Ryanair being enabled to safely operate longer
 European routes from Belfast City Airport and for this we need the runway
 extension.
While we recognise the right of the Government and people of Northern Ireland to
 subject this small runway extension to an extended planning process, these
 repeated delays, the reference to a public inquiry and now the further delay to
 the public inquiry for spurious noise reasons, shows a lack of willingness on
 the part of the local authorities to grow and develop traffic, routes, tourism
 and jobs in Northern Ireland.
In these circumstances sadly we have better alternative airports elsewhere in
 the UK and Europe, all of whom are willing and able to provide us with the
 runway infrastructure and low cost facilities we need in order to operate our
 lowest fare flights immediately, safely and profitably.
We will of course continue to work with Brian Ambrose and his team at Belfast
 City Airport, and wish them continued success in securing the runway extension,
 but we are not prepared to continue to operate at Belfast City with restricted
 routes and loads because of repeated planning delays.  I would like to
 personally thank Brian Ambrose and his team for their help and support in
 developing a successful route network there in recent years, which has seen
 Ryanair deliver more than 3m passengers over the past 3 years at Belfast City,
 whilst sustaining up to 50 direct and over 1,000 indirect jobs at the airport
 and local support services."

Commenting on the markets, Vincent Devlin, representing the Investment Manager
 noted:
Fund Performance & Attribution
 During July the Company's NAV underperformed its reference index, although the
 share price outperformed. The NAV gained 6.0% in Sterling terms and the share
 price increased 7.5% in the month. During the same period, the FTSE World
 Europe ex UK Index (net) rose 6.7%.
After a weak second quarter, European equity markets rallied in July as fears
 of a double-dip recession began to subside and positive company earnings
 releases for the second quarter of 2010 buttressed the case for a recovering
 corporate profit cycle. Following positive announcements regarding bank stress
 tests and the proposed Basel 3 regulation, Financials were the strongest
 performing sector in July, followed by Oil & Gas, Telecoms and Utilities.
The portfolio's underperformance during July was largely caused by a strong
 sector rotation as investors moved capital back into Financials and
 Telecommunications stocks. Positions in Utilities underperformed, and the
BlackRock Grtr Eur Portfolio Update
 Company suffered from not owning positions in Financials and Telecoms that make
 up larger parts of the reference index, although a position in higher-beta
 Financial, Société Générale, performed well. Other detractors at a stock level
 included a position in Swiss hearing aid company Sonova after two hearing aid
 distributors reported muted second quarter earnings, although this company
 continues to gain market share, especially in the higher end product lines.
The Company benefited from holdings in companies that reported strong second
 quarter earnings. These included Finnish industrial company Konecranes and
 Portugal-listed supermarket Jeronimo Martins. In addition, positions in
 non-life insurance company Euler Hermes and banking group Julius Baer performed
 well as Financials rallied.
Relative to the reference index, the Company ended the period with a higher
 weighting in Industrials, Consumer Goods, Consumer Services, Telecoms and
 Health Care and a lower weighting in Oil & Gas, Financials, Basic Materials and
 Utilities.
Outlook
 Our outlook remains positive, despite the well-publicised economic headwinds
 within the region. Europe remains under-owned and valuations continue to look
 compelling on a relative and historic basis. Europe also looks attractive on a
 yield basis, with many European companies committing to or confirming dividend
 policies. With net cash on their balance sheets, we would expect European
 corporates to look for M&A opportunities in the coming months.

GARTMORE IRISH GROWTH FUND PLC
INTERIM MANAGEMENT STATEMENT (UNAUDITED)
This interim management statement covers the period from 1 April 2010 to 30
 June 2010. It has been produced for the sole purpose of providing information
 to the Company's shareholders in accordance with the requirements of the UK
 Listing Authority's Disclosure and Transparency Rules. It should not be relied
 upon for any other purpose.
Investment Objective
The Company seeks to provide shareholders with long-term capital growth through
 investment in quoted companies which are either incorporated in the Republic of
 Ireland or Northern Ireland or, if elsewhere, derive the majority of their
 turnover or profits from the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland or are
 listed on the ISEQ Index.
It is considered that the Company, through the securities in which it invests,
 offers an attractive and relatively direct means of investing in Ireland,
 thereby giving exposure to:
? its attractive demographics;
? low corporation tax;
Gartmore Irish Interim Management Statement
? an attractive English-speaking base for international investors, particularly
 from the USA, to service the EU market;
? an attractive base from which Irish companies can develop international
 business; and
? a pro-business Government and culture.
Manager's Comments for the Three Months to 30 June 2010
Over the three months to 30 June 2010, the Company's NAV fell 11.3%, by
 comparison with the ISEQ Index which declined 16.9% in sterling terms.
There have been further equity placings within the Irish market this quarter,
 and we participated in those of Petroceltic, Bank of Ireland and Minco. We sold
 the Petroceltic position a few weeks later at a profit. Other new holdings
 during the quarter included CRH, Independent News, Merrion Pharmaceuticals and
 C&C Group.
The greatest contribution to performance over the quarter came from Andor
 Technology, which develops and manufactures high-performance digital cameras.
 Its share price rose significantly in April when it released a positive trading
 update and announced the acquisition of Photonic Instruments. During June,
 Andor announced excellent interim results, with turnover up 24% and pre-tax
 profit up 87%. These results surpassed expectations and led to broker upgrades,
 which in turn led to a sharp rise in the share price to nearly double the level
 at the beginning of the year.
We also profited from a position in Ryanair, which we sold in mid-April, just
 before the Icelandic volcanic eruption disrupted air travel across Europe. This
 marked the start of a significant decline in Ryanair's share price, during
 which time we had no exposure.
Adding to our Aer Lingus position during April also benefited the portfolio as
 the price rose during June. Towards the end of last year we identified Aer
 Lingus as a company that could attract greater investor interest, and it has
 since shown improvements in trading over last year. Management remain cautious
 on the outlook, but restructuring has been positive so far and there is scope
 for further operating improvements which could unlock more value.
Other contributors included our holdings in Icon, UTV Media and Aryzta. The
 poorest performance came from our holding in Bank of Ireland, which fell
 significantly after its placing near the end of April. Total Produce declined,
 as did a number of our larger positions including Greencore, Irish Continental
 and Norkom.
Investment Outlook
Ireland has received plaudits for starting its austerity program early, and
Gartmore Irish Interim Management Statement
 remains busy with the implementation of its plan which is designed to address
 the budget deficit. Early acknowledgement of its problems means that Ireland is
 ahead of other European countries - stress tests for banks and cuts in public
 spending, for instance, were introduced by Ireland before other countries. The
 upshot of this is that Ireland has not been hit quite as hard by the sovereign
 debt concerns of 2010 so far, despite the fears of contagion from Greece and
 other euro-zone countries with similar problems. Bearing in mind the scale of
 Ireland's problems, the progress made so far is impressive.
One thing very much in Ireland's favour is euro weakness, particularly against
 sterling. With the UK its largest trading partner, exporters stand to gain.
 Consumer demand is now also improving and surpassing expectations.
In terms of portfolio activity, there is no shortage of ideas and opportunities
 for the Fund. Good companies are still being overlooked because of their Irish
 incorporation, and when investors catch up with the reality of Ireland's
 improved prospects these companies should benefit. There is also a great deal
 of capital raising at attractive prices, and euro weakness makes Irish
 companies attractive takeover targets.
Material Events and Transactions
Over the three months to 30 June 2010 the Company repurchased 542,711 Ordinary
 shares at prices ranging from 613.46p to 705.85p per share excluding expenses
 (at discounts to net asset value including current period revenue of between
 8.52% and 14.65%). No shares have been repurchased subsequent to the end of the
 period under review. The shares in issue now total 6,706,409, none of which are
 held in Treasury. The Company will continue, as and when appropriate, to
 exercise its powers to buy back shares, with the objective of enhancing the NAV
 per share and of providing more liquidity in the quote.

RYANAIR'S TRAFFIC GROWS 13% IN JULY TO A RECORD 7.6M
 Ryanair, the world's favourite international airline, today (4th Aug) confirmed
 that its traffic grew by 13% in July 2010 to 7.61m passengers, a new monthly
 record - smashing the previous record of 6.8m passengers set in August 2009.
 Ryanair carried over 70m passengers in the 12 months ending July 2010, a new 12
 month record.
 Ryanair's growth confirms that passengers continue to switch from high fare,
 fuel surcharging flag carriers, such as Air France, BA and Lufthansa who
 continue to lose passengers to Ryanair's lowest fares and industry leading
 customer service (including No. 1 punctuality, baggage delivery and flight
 completion rate).
 Ryanair's booked passenger and load factor statistics for July 2010 are as
 follows:
 +-------------+---------+---------+----------+-------------+

Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair's Traffic Grows 13% In July To Record 7.6M
 passengers who were booked to fly on flights which were cancelled due to the
 unnecessary closures of parts of EU airspace following the volcanic eruptions in
 Iceland.
 Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
 "Ryanair's unbeatable formula of the lowest fares, no fuel surcharges and
 industry leading customer service continues to encourage passengers to switch
 from high fares, fuel surcharging, strike-ridden flag carriers who offer few
 frills to passengers other than delays, lost baggage, cancelations and strikes.
 Ryanair's July traffic increased by 13% to 7.61m passengers and with over
 70million passengers in the 12 months ending July 2010 Ryanair remains 'the
 world's favourite international airline'."

DUTCH COURT BANS INTERNET RESELLER WEGOLO FROM SELLING RYANAIR FLIGHTS
Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, today (29th July) welcomed a landmark
 victory in the Dutch (Utrecht) Courts which ruled that copying flight
 information from Ryanair's website for the purpose of reselling flights by
 internet reseller Wegolo is unlawful.
The Dutch court ruled that the extraction of flight data from Ryanair's website
 breached Ryanair's rights under Dutch Copyright law.  It also found that Wegolo
 can have a negative impact on Ryanair's website and damage Ryanair's reputation
 for offering the lowest fares in Europe. Wegolo must now surrender profits made
 from their unlicensed and unlawful activity to Ryanair and pay Ryanair damages
 and costs.  Wegolo is banned from extracting information from Ryanair's website
 for the purpose of selling Ryanair's flights.
This Dutch court decision is yet another victory for Ryanair after recent wins
 in Germany, Ireland and the UK.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
"Today's victory in the Dutch courts is another milestone in Ryanair's fight
Ryanair Holdings PLC Dutch Court Bans Wegolo Selling Ryanair Flights
 against internet screenscrapers and resellers.  Websites such as Wegolo have for
 too long been getting away with unauthorised reselling of Ryanair's flights with
 the addition of extra charges, which consumers don't pay when they book directly
 with Ryanair.
"Ryanair is pleased that the Dutch courts have recognised that this conduct is
 unlawful.  This decision, along with recent decisions in Germany, Ireland and
 the UK shows that European Courts support Ryanair's pro-consumer fight against
 the unauthorised use of Ryanair's website. It will be used as a precedent in
 ongoing litigation against screenscrapers.
"Genuine price comparison only websites, who wish to present Ryanair's low fares
 information to consumers as opposed to reselling Ryanair flights with additional
 fees and charges, can enter into a licence agreement with Ryanair to provide
 price comparison only information.  If Wegolo is genuinely interested in
 providing an honest price comparison service, it is welcome to sign up to this
 licence which is subject to a charitable donation of EUR100."

Commenting on the markets, Vincent Devlin, representing the Investment Manager
 noted:
Fund Performance & Attribution
 During June the Company's NAV outperformed its reference index, although the
 share price performed less well. The NAV fell by 2.6% (net) in Sterling terms
 and the share price fell by 3.3% in the month. During the same period, the FTSE
 World Europe ex UK Index (net) lost 3.0%.
European equity markets continued to slide in June. The poor performance was
 driven, in part, by continued fears over a double-dip recession and, at a
 global level, fears over China's economy having become overheated. In addition,
 uncertainty over bank stress tests and financial regulation fuelled investor
 caution. The Euro also continued to weaken relative to other currencies, most
 notably the dollar.
The Company's strong relative performance was driven by a combination of strong
 stock selection and sector positioning. At a sector level, a larger weighting
 in Industrials and Consumer Goods benefited the portfolio versus the weightings
 of the index. In addition, stock selection within the Basic Materials and
 Technology sectors performed particularly well.
At a stock level, a position in global freight forwarder Kuehne + Nagel
BlackRock Grtr Eur Portfolio Update
 benefited from strong demand for air freight and it continued to gain market
 share from its competitors. In addition, a holding in hearing aid manufacturer
 Sonova continued to perform due to its strong product line-up and future growth
 prospects, and the decision to participate in an IPO in probiotics company
 Christian Hansen proved successful within the month.
Positioning
 Relative to the reference index, the Company ended the period with a higher
 weighting in Industrials, Consumer Goods, Consumer Services, Telecoms and Oil &
 Gas and a lower weighting in Financials, Basic Materials and Utilities.
Outlook
 Our outlook for the second half of the year remains positive, despite the
 well-publicized economic headwinds within the region. Sovereign debt issues,
 fiscal austerity and concerns over financial regulation have provided
 significant cause for concern since the beginning of the year, manifest in both
 a weakening Euro and declining stock markets. We anticipate muted levels of
 growth in the worst-hit peripheral economies over the next few years, although
 we also recognize that areas of Europe are less indebted and more stable than
 many other global developed economies.
We feel it is important to distinguish between the economic situation within
 the region and the outlook for European corporate profitability. We recognize
 that a weakening Euro is a net positive for exporters outside the Eurozone and
 we continue to find a number of strong investment opportunities that are able
 to benefit from translational gains. In addition, Europe offers a number of
 well-managed companies that are able to access the strongest areas of global
 growth through high quality product offerings. We anticipate a stronger than
 expected second quarter earnings season and expect this may stabilize investor
 confidence in the absence of supportive economic data.

 RYANAIR Q1 PROFITS UP 1% TO EUR139M,
 TRAFFIC GROWS 8% TO 18M PASSENGERS.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest International scheduled airline, today (20th July
 2010) announced a Q1 Net Profit of EUR138.5m, an increase of 1% over last year's
 Q1 figure (excluding pre tax exceptional costs of EUR50m from the volcanic ash
 airspace closures in April and May).  Total revenues rose by 16% to EUR896.8m due
 to an 8% rise in traffic and a 5% increase in average fares.  Unit costs rose by
 9% due to higher fuel prices (excluding fuel they rose 1%) as sector length grew

Announcing these results Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
"Our Q1 profits were adversely impacted by the unnecessary closures of European
 airspace for 18 days in April and May.  Despite these volcanic ash disruptions
 Ryanair continues to increase traffic, yields, and profits, while most of our
 competitors are cutting capacity and reporting losses.  Yields rose by 5% due to
 a 13% increase in sector length offset by price promotions launched to get
 people flying again after the airspace closures.  Ancillary revenues also rose
 at a faster rate than the growth in traffic to 23% of total revenues.
Fuel costs rose by 34% to EUR287m due to higher oil prices and a 13% sector length
 increase.  Costs (excluding fuel) rose by just 1% due to unit cost reductions
 achieved in staff, airport and handling costs, and we continue to reduce costs
 across most other areas.  We are 90% hedged for FY11 at $730 per tonne, and we
 have hedged 90% of H1 FY12 at an average of $755 per tonne.
Our new routes and bases (Malaga and Malta) are performing well.  We open our
 42nd base in Barcelona (El Prat) in September (5 aircraft/20 new routes), and
 our 43rd in Valencia in November (2 aircraft/10 new routes).  We continue to see
 enormous opportunities to grow our business across Europe as many airports
 vigorously compete to attract Ryanair's traffic growth.  This aggressive
 competition between airports has resulted in airport unit costs falling by 8%,
 and we plan to announce more lower cost routes and bases later this year.
The Irish government's disastrous EUR10 tourist tax has caused a continuing
 collapse in Irish tourism.  Traffic at Dublin airport in May fell 15% to just
 1.6m, and is on track to fall by a further 3m to just 17m passengers in 2010,
 down almost 30% from the 23.5m pax. handled in 2008.  The Government's failed
 policy of gouging tourists with a EUR10 tax and the DAA monopoly's policy of
 increasing charges (by up to 40% in 2010) must be scrapped if this downward
 tourism spiral is to be reversed.  As a direct result of the EUR10 tourist tax and
 the DAA's higher fees, we have cut our winter capacity in Dublin by 15% and have
 switched these aircraft to other EU countries that have scrapped tourist taxes,
 lowered airport charges, and returned to tourism growth.
In the UK the tourist tax of GBP11 combined with the BAA's high airport charges
 are damaging both tourism and the British economy.  The BAA monopoly has seen
 its traffic collapse by 2.6m in the first 5 months of 2010 during a period when
 Ryanair has grown by 3m passengers.  We will cut our winter UK capacity by 16%,
 while Stansted capacity will fall by 17%.  The new UK government should urgently
 break up the high cost BAA monopoly (as recommended by the Competition
 Commission), and scrap the damaging GBP11 tourist tax which has caused a
 significant decline in UK traffic and tourism.
Ryanair Holdings PLC First Quarter Results
The unnecessary airspace closures in April and May (following the Icelandic
 volcano) led to the cancellation of 9,400 Ryanair flights, and the loss of
 almost 1.5m passengers in Q1.  We are currently processing claims under the
 unfair and disproportionate EU 261 regulations, although it will be some time
 before the full cost of these cancellations will be known.  As a result we have
 maintained our initial estimate of an exceptional cost of EUR50m.  This episode
 clearly shows that the EU 261 regulations should be amended to include a force
 majeure clause to relieve airlines of the "duty of care" in cases where the
 cancellation is not within the airlines control.   We have also called for a cap
 on the quantum and period that passengers can claim for.  Such a cap would
 prevent the discrimination which currently exists, whereby EU coaches and
 ferries already have their liability limited to the ticket price paid, whereas
 airlines are exposed to unlimited liability even when governments close their
 airspace and prevent airlines from flying.  These EU 261 regulations should be
 urgently amended to prevent this unfair, disproportionate, and discriminatory
 treatment of EU airlines.
Our outlook for the year remains cautious and unchanged.  We expect passenger
 volumes will rise by 11% to 73.5m (i.e. before any volcanic ash disruptions).
 We anticipate that yields in Q2 will rise by between 10% to 15%, but since we
 have no visibility, we must remain cautious about yields for the coming winter
 (H2).  We believe it is reasonable to expect that the yield increase for the
 full year will be within the range of 5% to 10% previously guided.  Unit costs
 excluding fuel will increase by approx. 4% (adjusted for sector length they will
 fall by 6%).  As a result we expect full year Net profits to rise by 10% to 15%
 or between approx. EUR350m to EUR375m, which remains in line with our previous
 guidance.
Cash in hand due to increased profits rose by EUR259m to EUR3.1bln.  In June we
 proposed a one off dividend of EUR500m payable on October 1 next, subject to
 shareholder approval at the AGM on 22 Sept, 2010.  For further details on the
 dividend payment, please go to the Investors Relations page on www.ryanair.com.
ENDS.                              Tuesday, 20th July 2010

 environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K.,
 European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory
 agencies, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport
 access and charges, labour relations, the economic environment of the airline
 industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the UK and Continental
 Europe, the general willingness of passengers to travel and other economics,
 social and political factors, and flight interruptions caused by volcanic ash
 emissions or other atmospheric disruptions.
Ryanair is the World's favourite airline with 43 bases and 1100+ low fare routes
 across 26 countries, connecting 155 destinations. Ryanair operates a fleet of
 250 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft with firm orders for a further 72 new aircraft
 (before taking account of planned disposals), which will be delivered over the
 next 2 years. Ryanair currently has a team of more than 8,000 people and expects
 to carry approximately 73.5 million passengers in the current fiscal year
 (pre-volcanic ash disruptions).

 revenues per passenger and a 5% increase in average fares.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 14% to EUR692.9m due to an 8% rise in
 passenger volumes and a 5% increase in average fares.  Load factor remained flat
 at 83%, compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2009.
Ancillary revenues increased by 23% to EUR203.9m, faster than the 8% increase in
 passenger volume, due to a 14% rise in average spend per passenger primarily due
 to a combination of higher onboard spend (which was helped by longer sector
 length),  improved product mix, increased take up of priority boarding, and
 higher internet related revenues.
Total operating expenses increased by 17% to EUR727.4m due to the 34% increase in
 fuel costs, a 1% increase in unit costs (excluding fuel) and the higher level of
 activity and costs associated with the growth of the airline.
Staff costs increased by 8% to EUR88.8m.  This reflects a 13% increase in average
 headcount to 7,828, offset by the impact of a company wide pay freeze, the
 higher portion of contract crew operating during the period, and the rise in
 cabin crew numbers during the quarter who earn lower than the average salary.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 13% to EUR61.9m.  This reflects an
 additional 46 lower cost 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this period compared to
 the quarter ended June 30, 2009.
Ryanair Holdings PLC First Quarter Results -8-
Fuel costs increased by 34% to EUR286.6m primarily due to the rise in fuel prices
 and an increase in the number of hours flown.
Maintenance costs increased by 14% to EUR21.8m due to an increase in the total
 number of leased aircraft from 47 to 55.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 11% to EUR24.0m, which is lower than the 17%
 increase in the total number of leased aircraft from 47 to 55, reflecting the
 positive impact of lower lease rentals achieved.
Route charges rose by 23% to EUR99.6m due to an increase in the number of sectors
 flown and an increase in average unit rates.
Airport & handling charges remained flat despite an 8% increase in passenger
 volumes, due to lower charges at new airports and bases launched and handling
 cost savings achieved.
Marketing, distribution and other expenses decreased by 4% to EUR28.5m,
 significantly lower than the 8% increase in passenger numbers, due to cost
 savings achieved.
Operating margin decreased by 1 point to 19% due to the reasons outlined above
 and operating profits have increased by 10% to EUR169.4m compared to the quarter
 ended June 30, 2009.
Finance income decreased by 16% to EUR6.2m primarily due to a combination of lower
 deposit interest rates and the impact of the placement of funds with highly
 rated and guaranteed financial institutions which typically provide a lower
 yield.
Finance expense increased by 10% to EUR20.2m due to the drawdown of additional
 debt to part finance the purchase of new aircraft, offset by lower interest
 rates.
Foreign exchange losses during the quarter of EUR0.8m are primarily due to the
 impact of movements in euro/sterling exchange rates.
Balance sheet
 Total cash and cash equivalents increased by EUR259.4m since March 31, 2010 to
 EUR3,072.8m.  The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR274.6m which
 partially funded capital expenditure incurred during the period.  Capital
 expenditure of EUR331.6m largely consisted of advance aircraft payments for future
 aircraft deliveries and the delivery of 18 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft in the
 quarter.  Total debt, net of repayments, increased by EUR303.6m to EUR3,259.8m
 during the quarter.  Net debt at period end was EUR187.0m.
Shareholders' equity at June 30, 2010 increased by EUR181.8m to EUR3,030.4m compared
 to March 31, 2010 due to the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for derivatives
 and available for sale financial assets, stock option grants, a net profit after
Ryanair Holdings PLC First Quarter Results -8-
 tax of EUR93.7m in the year and the issue of new shares of EUR12.8m (as detailed on
 page 8).

 Interim Management Report
Introduction
This financial report for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 meets the reporting
 requirements pursuant to the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations
 2007 and Transparency Rules of the Republic of Ireland's Financial Regulator and
 the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Services
 Authority.
This interim management report includes the following:
·       Reconciliation of results for the period under International Financial
 Reporting Standards ("IFRS") to adjusted results for the quarter ended June 30,
 2010;
·       Principal risks and uncertainties relating to the remaining nine months
 of the year;
·       Related party transactions; and
·       Post balance sheet events.
Results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 compared to the
 quarter ended June 30, 2009, including important events that occurred during the
 three months, are set forth in the Operating and Financial review on pages 9-11.
Reconciliation of results for the period under IFRS to adjusted results for the
 quarter ended June 30, 2010
The unaudited condensed consolidated interim income statement for the quarter
 ended June 30, 2010, as set forth on page 5 of this three month financial
 report, presents the results for the periods separately between pre-exceptional
 and exceptional items.  Certain items are presented separately, as exceptional
 items, which, by virtue of their size or incidence, are unusual in the context
 of the Groups's ongoing core operations, as we believe this presentation
 represents the underlying business more accurately and reflects the manner in
 which investors typically analyse the results.

 environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, costs
 associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the

 regulatory agencies, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates,
 airport access and charges, labour relations, the economic environment of the
 airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the UK, and
 Continental Europe, the general willingness of passengers to travel and other
 economic, social and political factors and flight interruptions caused by
 volcanic ash emissions or other atmospheric disruptions.

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Operating and Financial Overview
Introduction
For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") all figures
 and comments are by reference to the adjusted income statement excluding the
 exceptional items referred to below.  A reconciliation of the results for the
 period under IFRS to the adjusted results is provided on page 13.
Exceptional items in the quarter ended June 30, 2010 amounted to EUR50.0m (pre
 tax) reflecting the estimated costs relating to the closure of airspace in April
 and May due to the Icelandic volcanic ash disruptions.  Exceptional items in the
 quarter ended June 30, 2009 amounted to EUR13.5m reflecting an impairment of the
 Aer Lingus shareholding.
Adjusted profit after tax excluding exceptional items increased by 1% to
 EUR138.5m.  Including exceptional items the profit after tax for the quarter
 amounted to EUR93.7m compared to a profit of EUR123.0m in the quarter ended June 30,
 2009.
Summary quarter ended June 30, 2010
Adjusted profit after tax increased by 1% to EUR138.5m compared to EUR136.5m in the
 quarter ended June 30, 2009 primarily due to a 5% increase in average fares,
 offset by a 34% increase in fuel costs.  Total operating revenues increased by
 16% to EUR896.8m as average fares rose by 5% due to an increase in average sector
 lengths.  Ancillary revenues grew by 23%, faster than the increase in passenger
 volumes, to EUR203.9m due to a combination of higher onboard spend (which was
 helped by longer sector length), improved product mix, increased take up of
Ryanair Holdings PLC First Quarter Results -7-
 priority boarding, and higher internet related revenues.  Total revenue per
 passenger as a result increased by 7%, whilst Load Factors remained flat at 83%
 during the quarter.
Total operating expenses rose by 17% to EUR727.4m, primarily due to an increase in
 fuel prices, the higher level of activity, and increased operating costs
 associated with the growth of the airline.  Fuel, which represents 39% of total
 operating costs compared to 35% in the comparative quarter, increased by 34% to
 EUR286.6m due to the increase in the price per gallon paid and an 18% increase in
 the number of hours flown.  Unit costs excluding fuel rose by 1% and including
 fuel they rose by 9%.  Operating margin decreased by 1 point to 19% whilst
 operating profit increased by 10% to EUR169.4m.
Adjusted net margin decreased from 18% to 15% at June 30, 2010 for the reasons
 outlined above.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were 9.36 cent compared to 9.26 cent
 in the comparative quarter ended June 30, 2009.
Balance sheet
 Total cash and cash equivalents increased by EUR259.4m since March 31, 2010 to
 EUR3,072.8m.  The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR274.6m which
 partially funded capital expenditure incurred during the period.  Capital
 expenditure of EUR331.6m largely consisted of advance aircraft payments for future
 aircraft deliveries and the delivery of 18 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft in the
 quarter.  Total debt, net of repayments, increased by EUR303.6m to EUR3,259.8m
 during the quarter.  Net debt at period end was EUR187.0m.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis quarter ended June 30, 2010
Adjusted profit after tax, increased by 1% to EUR138.5m primarily due to a 5%
 increase in average fares and longer sector lengths offset by higher fuel costs.
 Total operating revenues increased by 16% to EUR896.8m due to a 5% increase in
 average fares, a 14% increase in ancillary revenues per passenger, and an 8%
 increase in passenger numbers.  Fuel, which represents 39% of total operating
 costs compared to 35% in the comparative quarter, increased by 34% to EUR286.6m
 due to a higher price per gallon paid, and an increase in the number of hours
 flown.  Unit costs excluding fuel rose by 1% and including fuel they rose by 9%.

 profit increased by 10% to EUR169.4m.
Total operating revenues increased by 16% to EUR896.8m due to a 5% increase in
 average fares, an 8% increase in passenger traffic to 18.0m, and a 23% increase

 Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as adopted by the EU
 ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full annual
 financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent
 published consolidated financial statements of the Group. The consolidated
 financial statements of the Group as at and for the year ended March 31, 2009
 are available at www.ryanair.com.
 The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2010 do not
 constitute statutory financial statements of the Group within the meaning of
 Regulation 40 of the European Communities (Companies, Group Accounts)
 Regulations, 1992.  The consolidated financial statements of the Groupfor the
 year ended March 31, 2010, together with the independent auditor's report
 thereon, will be filed with the Irish Registrar of Companies following the
 Company's Annual General Meeting and will also be available on the Company's
 website. Statutory financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2009 have
 been filed with the Companies' Office.  The auditors' report on those financial
 statements was unqualified.
The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors,
 approved the interim financial statements for the three months ended June 30,
 2010 on July 19, 2010.
Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been
 prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most
Ryanair Holdings PLC First Quarter Results -9-
 recent published consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in
 accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and in compliance with IFRS as issued
 by the International Accounting Standards Board.
There were no new standards, interpretations or amendments to existing standards
 adopted for the first time in the financial year 2010, which would have a
 material impact on our financial position or results from operations.
The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be
 adopted for purposes of the preparation of future financial statements, where
 applicable. We do not anticipate that the adoption of these new or revised
 standards and interpretations will have a material impact on our financial
 position or results from operations.
·      IFRS 3 (revised 2008), "Business Combinations" (effective for new
 acquisitions occurring in financial years beginning on or after July 1, 2009).
 ·      IFRIC 19, "Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments"
 (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after July 1, 2010).
 ·      IAS 24 (revised 2009), "Related Party Disclosures" (effective for fiscal
 periods beginning on or after January 1, 2011).
 ·      Amendments to IFRIC 14, "IAS 19 - The Limit on a Defined Benefit Assets,
 Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction" (effective for fiscal
 periods beginning on or after January 1, 2011).
 ·      IFRS 9, "Financial Instruments" (effective for fiscal periods beginning
 on or after January 1, 2013).
 ·      The IASB's third annual improvements project, "Improvements to
 International Financial Reporting Standards 2010", published on May 6, 2010
 (effective dates are dealt with on a standard-by-standard basis).
Exceptional items
 The Company presents certain items separately, which are unusual, by virtue of
 their size and incidence, in the context of our ongoing core operations, as we
 believe this presentation represents the underlying business more accurately and
 reflects the manner in which investors typically analyse the results.  In the
 current and prior period comparative we have presented the estimated costs
 relating to the closure of European air space due to the Icelandic volcanic ash
 disruptions as an exceptional item.  In the prior period comparative we have
 presented the impairment of our investment in Aer Lingus separately because of
 the unusual nature of these items.  Any amounts deemed "exceptional" for
 management discussion and analysis purposes have been classified for the
 purposes of the IFRS income statement in the same way as non exceptional amounts
 of the same nature.
2.  Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements,
 estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.  Actual
 results may differ from these estimates.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements
 made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key
Ryanair Holdings PLC First Quarter Results -9-
 sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the
 most recent published consolidated financial statements.
3.  Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to
 quarter, and management expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors
 causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to general
 economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly the
 first half-year typically results in substantially higher revenues and results.
4.  Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the
 quarter ended June 30, 2010 was 10.4% (2009:  8.6%).  The tax charge for the
 quarter ended June 30, 2010 of EUR10.9m (2009: EUR11.6m) primarily comprises of a
 deferred tax charge relating to temporary differences for property, plant and
 equipment recognised in the income statement and the utilisation of previous
 trading losses.
5.  Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most
 recent published consolidated financial statements.  The charge to the income
 statement in the year of approximately EUR1.2m (2009: EUR1.6m) is related to the
 fair value of various share options granted in prior periods, which are being
 recognised within the income statement in accordance with employee services
 rendered.
6.  Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its
 business.  The Group does not believe that any such litigation will individually
 or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
 Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, management
 believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not
 expected to materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or
 financial position.
7.  Capital commitments
 At June 30, 2010 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 250 (2009: 196) Boeing
 737-800 aircraft.  It also had firm orders for an additional 72 Boeing
 737-800's.  The delivery of these firm order aircraft will increase the fleet
 size (net of planned disposals) to 299 aircraft by March 31, 2013.
8.  Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR116.2m at March 31,
 2010 to EUR129.0m at June 30, 2010 is comprised of a gain of EUR12.8m, recognised
 through other comprehensive income, reflecting the increase in the share price
 from EUR0.73 per share at March 31, 2010 to EUR0.81 per share at June 30, 2010.  All
Ryanair Holdings PLC First Quarter Results -9-
 impairment losses are required to be recognised in the income statement and are
 not subsequently reversed, while gains are recognised through other
 comprehensive income.
9.  Analysis of operating segment
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares
 airline-related services, including scheduled services, car hire services,
 internet and other related services to third parties across a European route
 network.   The Company operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed
 through a single route scheduling system.
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information
 that internally is provided to Michael O'Leary, CEO, who is the Company's Chief
 Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource allocation decisions the
 CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation
 decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the
 entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in type.  The objective in making
 resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial results,
 rather than individual routes within the network.
The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated
 adjusted profit/(loss) after tax of the Company for the year. This measure
 excludes the effects of certain income and expense items, which are unusual, by
 virtue of their size and incidence, in the context of the Company's ongoing core
 operations, such as the costs relating to the closure of airspace in April and
 May 2010 due to the Icelandic volcanic ash disruptions and the impairment of a
 financial asset investment (see reconciliation on page 13).
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company
 has a single reportable segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which
 is flexibly employed across the Company's integrated route network and is
 directly attributable to its reportable segment operations.  In addition, as the
 Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and liabilities
 have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
 Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

 RUSH OF 'WORLD CUP' BOOKINGS HELPS RYANAIR SMASH MONTHLY PASSENGER RECORD
OVER 7M PASSENGERS BOOKED TO TRAVEL IN JULY - SO FAR
Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, today (16th July) confirmed that a rush
 of 'World Cup' bookings has seen over 7million passengers book to travel on its
 guaranteed lowest fares this July - a new monthly record and the first time any
 European airline will carry over 7m passengers in a single month.
Ryanair will carry more passengers to summer sun destinations in July than most
 airlines will carry during the entire summer season as its combination of
 Europe's guaranteed lowest fares and industry leading customer service, with the
 least lost bags, fewest cancelations and best on-time performance, make Ryanair
 Europe's biggest and best airline.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
"Ryanair will break a new monthly passenger record by carrying over 7m
 passengers in just one month, for the first time this July.  Ryanair.com
 experienced a rush of 'World Cup' bookings every time a European team got
 knocked out of the World Cup as holiday hungry families swamped our website in
Ryanair Holdings PLC Monthly Record Smashed with 7M Passengers
 search of unbeatable summer sun deals.  The great news is that even with these
 record breaking bookings there is still time for passengers to grab one of our
 guaranteed lowest fares this summer and help push us even further into the
 record books."

Stelios receives retraction and apology from Ryanair and Michael O'Leary
London, 15 July 2010.  Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou has today received a full
 retraction and apology from Ryanair and Chief Executive Michael O'Leary for
 running an advert at the beginning of this year suggesting that Stelios was
 lying about easyJet's punctuality.
The advert featured a picture of Stelios as Pinocchio and referred to him as
 "easyJet's - Mr Late Again" and called on "Stelios...to stop hiding the truth"
 about easyJet's flight delays and resume publishing weekly details of easyJet's
 on-time performance.
Stelios issued High Court proceedings against Ryanair and Michael O'Leary after
 the advert was published claiming that the statements made about him were
 libellous.
Michael O'Leary and Ryanair have today unreservedly apologised to Stelios in
 open court and in writing for these remarks in so far as they related to him
 personally and suggested that he was lying about the matter.  They accept that
 Stelios is not responsible for the non publication of easyJet's on-time
 statistics and was not involved in the decision by easyJet management to cease
easyGroup Holdings Retraction and apology from Ryanair and O'Leary
 publishing the figures.
"It is not very often that someone as arrogant and as powerful as O'Leary is
 forced to apologise to someone else in public and in writing. I took this legal
 action to protect my reputation. I am not a liar and that statement was
 libellous.
I would like to dedicate this little victory to all those members of the
 travelling public who have suffered verbal abuse and hidden extras at the hands
 of O'Leary."
A full page apology at the expense of Ryanair will run in today's Daily
 Telegraph and Guardian and will be repeated in those newspapers next week. It
 will also appear on Ryanair's website.
Michael O'Leary and Ryanair have undertaken not to publish the advert again and
 have agreed to pay Stelios damages and legal costs in settlement of the  libel
 claim.
The sum offered was GBP50,100 which Stelios has accepted. He will donate the
 money to his philanthropic foundation and it has been agreed it will be used for
 the Stelios Award for Disabled Entrepreneurs in the UK - 2010 which is run in
 partnership with Leonard Cheshire, the disability charity.

 RYANAIR CALLS FOR DUBLIN AIRPORT TO TRANSFER ITS EUR1.2BN WHITE ELEPHANT T2 TO
 NAMA
Ryanair cuts Dublin Winter capacity by 15%, as
 Dublin Airport traffic falls to 17m in 2010
Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline, today (8 July) called on the DAA to
 transfer its EUR1.2bn T2 to NAMA and to reverse the up to 40% increases in
 passenger charges at Dublin Airport in 2010, as Dublin Airport traffic continues
 to collapse.  The airline also called on the Govt to scrap its EUR10 tourist tax
 and follow the example of other EU countries, who have scrapped tourist taxes
 and returned to tourism growth.
Ryanair announced that its Dublin base this winter will be cut from 14 aircraft
 (2009) to 12 aircraft (in 2010) and Ryanair will operate less than 850 weekly
 flights from Dublin compared to 1,000 last winter.  These aircraft will be
 switched to other EU countries which have reduced airport charges and scrapped
 Govt tourist taxes, whereas Ireland continues to lose visitors by imposing
 tourist taxes and raising airport charges.
Recent independent analysis shows that the UK and Ireland, the two remaining EU
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Cuts Dublin Winter Capacity by 15%
 countries with tourist taxes, continue to suffer traffic declines, while most
 other European countries have returned to growth in 2010.  The Irish Govt's
 argument that Ireland's tourism decline is "due to the recession" is disproved
 by Ryanair's continuing rapid growth, and the return to growth of most other EU
 airports.  Since the Irish Govt imposed the EUR10 passenger tax in April 2009,
 traffic at Dublin Airport has fallen by some 30% from 23.5m in 2008 to under 17m
 in 2010, which is less than 2004 traffic levels at Dublin.  In just two years
 Dublin airport has lost over 7 years of hard won traffic growth.
The situation at Dublin Airport continues to worsen daily.  While Terminal 1
 (with the addition of Pier D) is now capable of handling 30 million passengers
 p.a., traffic in 2010 will be less than 17m. Dublin's current traffic can be
 easily handled in half the capacity of the existing terminal.  Yet Dublin
 Airport has wasted EUR1.2bn in developing T2 and its associated facilities (which
 is 5 times more than the DAA's original "EUR170m to EUR200m" budget).  The DAA now
 proposes to open this EUR1.2bn white elephant in November, so that it can claim up
 to 40% price increases which the Dept of Transport ordered the Aviation
 Regulator to approve in order to protect the viability of the DAA.  This means
 that Ryanair, Cityjet and Aer Arann passengers using the existing Terminal 1
 will now be paying up to 40% higher airport charges to subsidise those few
 passengers using the white elephant T2.  The DAA now expects Ryanair passengers
 to pay for Terminal 2, despite the fact that they'll never use it.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said today:
"Ryanair believes that T2 should be transferred to NAMA which is a Govt vehicle
 for working out the debts of reckless property developers, as Ryanair believes
 that T2 was the single most reckless, expensive and unnecessary property
 development of the entire Celtic tiger years.
"The DAA claims that T2 is a statement about modern Ireland and they are
 absolutely correct.  This building is massively oversized, over specified, and
 totally unneeded at Dublin Airport, where the existing terminal can handle 30m
 passengers p.a., yet traffic this year will be less than 17m passengers.  Dublin
 Airport passengers are now being asked to pay up to 40% higher airport charges,
 to fund a reckless property development, which the DAA originally promised to
 build for between EUR170m to EUR200m, but which has finally cost almost EUR1.2bn, a
 fivefold overrun.
"T2 is the most perfect example of Ireland's recent property bubble.  It is
 badly designed, badly located, massively oversized and effectively bankrupt.  By
 wasting EUR1.2bn on this unnecessary facility, despite the opposition of its
 airline users, the DAA now has a building that it doesn't need, can't pay for,
 and yet it proposes to open it in November and force all passengers to subsidise
 it, even those passengers who don't use it.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Cuts Dublin Winter Capacity by 15%
"The damage being done to Irish tourism by this reckless EUR1.2bn white elephant
 cannot be overstated.  Since the Govt introduced its EUR10 tourist tax in April
 2009, traffic and tourism have slumped.  In the face of this traffic collapse,
 the DAA is now - with the support of the Dept of Transport - imposing price
 increases of up to 40% on passengers to pay for a reckless terminal building
 they don't need and won't use.  These higher costs have now made the Irish
 airports totally uncompetitive, which is why traffic to Ireland continues to
 collapse, while traffic growth has returned to most other European airports.
"Ryanair believes that the only way out of this mess is for the Irish Govt to
 scrap its EUR10 tourist tax, as the Dutch and Belgians have already, and for the
 DAA to transfer the EUR1.2bn T2 white elephant to NAMA, which would allow the DAA
 to reverse these 40% passenger cost increases, make Dublin Airport competitive,
 and begin the process of reversing the damage done to tourism by the Govt's EUR10
 tourist tax and the DAA's reckless property development.  Terminal 2 is a
 gold-plated white elephant.  NAMA is now Ireland's home for white elephants and
 so T2 belongs in NAMA.  Who knows, in years to come some property developer
 might convert it into a concert venue, a hotel, or flats and apartments, since
 it will never be needed for passengers at Dublin Airport, because passengers at
 Dublin Airport could never pay for the EUR1.2bn which the DAA have recklessly
 wasted on T2, a fivefold overrun on its original EUR170m to EUR200m budget."

Aer Lingus Statement on Judgement of the EU General Court
Dublin & London, 6 July 2010: Aer Lingus welcomes today's judgement by the EU
 General Court in Luxembourg dismissing Ryanair's appeal against the prohibition
 of its hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus. This decision confirms the EU
 Commission's findings that consumers would be harmed by such a takeover which
 would remove the competition between Aer Lingus and Ryanair on Irish routes.
In a separate judgement the Court refused Aer Lingus' appeal in which it sought
 clarification on the powers of the EU Commission under the EU Merger Regulation
 to deal with Ryanair's minority shareholding in Aer Lingus (currently 29.8%).
 Aer Lingus will consider this judgement in detail before deciding whether to
 make a further appeal to the European Court of Justice.
Colm Barrington, Aer Lingus Chairman said, "Today's rejection by the European
 Court of Ryanair's appeal confirms that a takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair
 would harm consumers and lead to higher prices on Irish routes. It is
 regrettable that the Court has not taken this opportunity to take the further
 step necessary to address the anti-competitive effects of Ryanair's minority
Aer Lingus Group PLC Judgement of the EU General Court
 shareholding in Aer Lingus which is contrary to the interests of the majority of
 our shareholders."

 RYANAIR WELCOMES EU COURT RULING THAT IT CAN RETAIN ITS 29.8% STAKE IN AER
 LINGUS
Ryanair, the world's favorite airline, today (6 July) welcomed the EU Court's
 confirmation of the European Commission's 2007 decision that it can not force
 Ryanair to sell its shareholding in Aer Lingus.  Ryanair also noted the Court's
 decision to reject Ryanair's appeal of the EU Commission's decision to block
 Ryanair's 2006 offer for Aer Lingus. Ryanair is currently studying the details
 of this 125 page judgment.
The EU Competition Commissioner, Neelie Kroes, said on 27 June 2007 that "Since
 Ryanair is not in a position to exert de jure or de facto control over Aer
 Lingus, the European Commission is not in a position to require Ryanair to
 divest its minority shareholding, which is, by the way, not a controlling
 stake."
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"We welcome today's ruling of the EU General Court which confirms that Ryanair
 can not be forced to dispose of its 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus.  This is
 the third time since 2007 that Aer Lingus has lost appeals on this issue.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Response to EU Court Ruling
We note the Court's decision on our appeal against the EU Commission's ruling on
 our 2006 offer for Aer Lingus.  This will not prevent Ryanair making a future
 offer for Aer Lingus, but obviously any such offer will have to take account of
 the court's detailed ruling.  Ryanair has no immediate plans to make a third
 offer for Aer Lingus, which in any event would be unlikely to succeed unless the
 Irish Govt decides to sell its 25% stake.
Ryanair regrets however, that since the rejection of our two previous offers for
 Aer Lingus, both of which contained guarantees on growing Aer Lingus' traffic,
 fleet, jobs and profitability Aer Lingus has become a small peripheral regional
 airline with declining traffic, fleet, jobs and is reporting substantial losses.
We continue to believe that the long term financial viability of Aer Lingus can
 only be secured as part of one strong Irish airline group, particularly when the
 rest of Europe's airlines are consolidating to three main flag carriers, lead by
 Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa and two large low fares carriers,
 Ryanair and easyjet.  Unless Aer Lingus finds a strong airline partner then we
 believe it is doomed to fail because it can't compete with Ryanair's low fares,
 customer service or scale."
NOTE TO EDITOR:
 The current merger proposal in Greece between Olympic and Aegean airlines shows
 the need for small regional carriers like Aer Lingus to merge and/or
 consolidate.

 RYANAIR CUTS UK WINTER CAPACITY BY 16%
GOVT'S GBP11 TOURIST TAX DEVASTATES TOURISM
STANSTED WINTER CAPACITY CUT BY 17%
Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, today (29th June) announced it will cut
 UK winter capacity by 16% from November with the loss of over 2m passengers at
 UK airports this winter (vs. winter '09) as the UK govt's GBP11 tourist tax
 continues to damage British traffic, tourism and jobs.
Winter capacity at London Stansted will also be cut by 17% from November.
 Ryanair will base 22 a/c in Stansted this winter (24 last winter) with 135 fewer
 weekly frequencies and a loss of up to 1.5m passengers at Stansted between
 November and March 2011.
Ryanair will switch these London based aircraft to other European bases where
 govts have scrapped tourist taxes and reduced passenger charges, in some case to
 zero, in order to grow tourism and traffic.  Ryanair will also cut winter
 flights at most of its other UK bases, except Edinburgh and Leeds Bradford.

Ryanair called on the UK govt to scrap its GBP11 APD and published independent
 (RDC Aviation) analysis showing that tourist taxes have caused steep tourism
 declines in the UK while seat capacity (and traffic) grew strongly in those EU
 countries which have scrapped these tourist taxes.
Announcing these cutbacks in London, Michael O'Leary said:
"Sadly UK traffic and tourism continues to collapse while Ryanair continues to
 grow rapidly in those countries which welcome tourists instead of taxing them.
 Ryanair's 16% UK capacity cutback, 17% cut at Stansted, shows just how much the
 UK's tourist tax and the BAA's high airport charges are damaging UK tourism and
 the British economy generally.
"Independent capacity analysis shows that growth has returned to the Belgian,
 Dutch and Spanish markets after their governments scrapped tourist taxes and/or
 reduced airport charges, in some cases to zero, in order to stimulate tourism
 and jobs.
"Today's cutbacks underline the urgent need to, (a) break-up the high cost BAA
 Airport Monopoly (as recommended by the Competition Commission) and (b) scrap
 the damaging GBP11 tourist tax which has caused UK traffic to collapse over the
 past two years."

 RYANAIR TO OPPOSE AN UNDEMOCRATIC CHANGE OF AER LINGUS'
 ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION AT TOMORROW'S AGM
Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, today (Thu, 17 Jun) confirmed that it
 will vote against Resolution 10 at Aer Lingus' AGM tomorrow. Resolution 10
 proposes a number of reasonable amendments to Aer Lingus' Articles of
 Association, which Ryanair would be happy to support, but includes one
 undemocratic provision that shareholders can only table resolutions for
 Extraordinary General Meetings (EGMs) at least 30 days in advance of an EGM,
 whereas Aer Lingus can call EGMs at just 14 day notice, which effectively
 deprives shareholders of their right to put forward resolutions at EGMs called
 by the Company, and is therefore undemocratic.
Ryanair wrote to Aer Lingus on 25 May, 31 May and 1 June, requesting that this
 undemocratic (30 day notice) clause be removed from Resolution 10, and that
 shareholders be allowed to put forward EGM resolutions up to 7 days in advance
 of such EGMs. This would allow shareholders 7 days to propose resolutions in the
 case of EGMs called by Aer Lingus at 14 day notice, which would be both fair and
 reasonable. Regrettably, Ryanair's reasonable requests have been rejected by Aer
 Lingus.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Statement in Advance of Aer Lingus AGM
Ryanair has no objection to the other amendments in Resolution 10, with the
 exception of a typographical error which has already been pointed out to Aer
 Lingus. Ryanair calls on the Board of Aer Lingus to arrange an early EGM and put
 a new Resolution 10 to shareholders without the undemocratic clause which would
 deprive those same shareholders of their right to propose resolutions at EGMs
 called by the Company. Ryanair is willing to support such a change to the
 Articles of Association as long as it does not restrict or undermine shareholder
 rights.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
"It is disappointing that Aer Lingus appears determined to deprive its
 shareholders of their reasonable right to propose EGM resolutions. Ryanair has
 been left with no alternative but to oppose the current Resolution 10 (which
 contains this undemocratic clause) in order to protect the rights of all Aer
 Lingus shareholders.
We hope the Board of Aer Lingus will arrange an EGM at their convenience in
 order to approve the remainder of Resolution 10, i.e., all those amendments to
 Articles of Association which are not undemocratic. Ryanair will happily support
 such a revised resolution provided that the rights of Aer Lingus' shareholders
 are not restricted or undermined."

Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results
Announcing these results Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
"The principal highlights of the past year include:-
- Profits trebled to EUR319m.
 - Traffic growth of 14% to 67m.
 - 51 net new aircraft (y/e fleet 232xB737-800's).
 - 8 new bases Bari, Brindisi, Faro, Leeds, Oslo Rygge, Pescara, Porto, Trapani
 (total 42).
 - 284 new routes (total 940).
 -Passenger service statistics further improved (No 1 on time major airline).
 - A dividend of EUR500m proposed (EUR846m returned to shareholders over the past 3
 years).
Results
 We can be proud of delivering a 200% increase in profits and traffic growth
 during a global recession  when many of our competitors have announced losses or
 cutbacks, while more have gone bankrupt including, Bluewings (Ger), Globespan
 (UK), My Air (Italy), Segal Air and Sky Europe (Slovakia).  Revenues rose 2% to
 EUR2,988m as air fares fell 13% while traffic grew 14% to 67m.  Unit costs fell
 19% due to lower fuel and rigorous cost control.  Ancillary sales grew 11% to
 EUR664m slightly slower than traffic growth, and amounted to 22% of total
 revenues.
Fuel costs declined 29% to EUR894m as oil prices fell from $104 to $62 pbl.  We
 extended our hedging program to 90% for FY11 (at $730 per tonne), 50% of Q1 FY12
 (at $750 per tonne) and 20% of Q2 FY12 (at $750 per tonne).  Excluding fuel
 other unit costs fell by 3%.
Capacity cuts by many European flag and non flag carriers caused traffic to fall
 at many major European airports.  We are inundated with offers from large and
 small airports competing with lower costs and efficient facilities to win
 Ryanair's growth.  Our airport and handling unit costs fell by 9% despite steep
 increases at Dublin and Stansted.  New routes and bases launched this year will
 ensure that despite a scandalous (up to) 40% increase in charges at Dublin
 airport, our airport and handling unit costs will decline again in FY11.
The balance sheet has strengthened as cash has risen by EUR535m to EUR2.8bln.  We
 took advantage of recent historically low rates to lock in many of our 2009/2010
 deliveries at an all inclusive long term interest cost of under 4% pa.  We are
 fully financed for the remaining 34 deliveries out to January 2011.
 Our long term dollar hedging strategy for capex, which extends to the end of
 2011, means that we will be purchasing aircraft in 2010/2011 at exceptionally
 low euro prices with a EUR/$ exchange rate of 1.46, significantly better than
 current  rates.
Current Issues.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results
 As we predicted Ireland's tourism industry collapsed in 2009.  Traffic at Dublin
 fell by over 3m (-13%) in a year when Ryanair's traffic grew by 8m.  Traffic at
 Dublin in 2010 to date has fallen by a further 14%.  Ireland's damaging EUR10
 tourist tax and the govt. imposed (up to) 40% cost increases at Dublin airport
 will lead to a second year of government inspired tourism collapses.  The
 opening of the DAA's EUR1.2bln T2 in November is unnecessary as capacity at T1 has
 reached 30m pa while Dublin's traffic will fall to under 18m in 2010.  The DAA
 should mothball T2 which will reduce their operating costs, slash their high
 fees, and the government must scrap this damaging EUR10 tourist tax if Ireland is
 to return to being a competitive destination and reverse this 2 year tourism
 collapse.
The Icelandic volcanic ash "monitoring" led to repeated, unnecessary, closures
 of large swathes of European airspace over 18 days from the 15th of April.
 These closures have caused the cancellation of 9,400 Ryanair flights, and the
 loss of 1.5m passengers up to the 18th of May.  The full cost of these
 cancellations will not be known for some time and will depend on the claims we
 receive under the unfair and disproportionate EU261 regulations.  We estimate
 the cumulative exceptional cost of these unnecessary cancellations is approx.
 EUR50m and we will continue to up-date shareholders quarterly on the likely final
 outcome.  The recent revisions of the VAAC charts for guesstimating the position
 of non-existent volcanic ash "clouds" highlights the mis-management of these
 eruptions by EU governments and regulatory agencies, who repeatedly and
 unnecessarily closed European air space.
EU 261 is a manifestly unfair, disproportionate and discriminatory regulation
 which requires airlines to reimburse expenses of disrupted passengers even in
 force majeure cases.  While volcanic ash airspace closures disrupted 1.5m
 Ryanair passengers over a period of 18 days we believe that airlines should not
 be exposed to such unlimited liability when the cause of these cancellations
 were clearly beyond the airlines control.  Other competing transport providers
 such as coaches and ferries are not obliged under EU 261 to meet the cost of
 care during force majeure events.  EU 261 needs to be amended to include a force
 majeure clause to relieve EU airlines of the "duty to care" obligations in such
 cases.
The EU 261 legislation is also disproportionate as there is no cap on either the
 quantum or the period that air passengers can claim for.  This discriminates
 against airlines because coaches and ferries have their liability limited to the
 ticket price paid which caps their exposure.  The airlines liability to
 compensation and right to care reimbursements should also be limited to the
 ticket price paid.   This would restore proportionality to the regulation since
 air passengers who have chosen to pay lower fares, and have benefited from
 significant savings, cannot and should not expect to receive unlimited
 compensation or reimbursements.
Proposed EUR500m Dividend.
 In December 2009 we ended our discussions for a 200 new Boeing aircraft order.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results
 Since we don't anticipate a new deal with Boeing for the foreseeable future, our
 gross capex will fall substantially over the next 3 years.  We expect to
 generate up to EUR1bn in surplus cash by the end of FY13.  We now propose to
 return EUR500m of this cash in a one off dividend in October 2010 subject to
 shareholder approval at our September AGM.  We also anticipate that there may be
 a further EUR500m (absent any new aircraft orders or other capex) available for
 return to shareholders either via share buy backs or another one off dividend by
 the end of FY13.  This EUR500m dividend if approved in September will bring to
 EUR846m the amount of funds returned to shareholders by Ryanair in share buy backs
 and dividends over the past 3 years.
Outlook.
 We expect to grow traffic in FY11 by 11% to 73.5m (subject to volcanic ash
 disruptions).  Fuel costs will increase by EUR300m.  However, subject to no
 further air space closures and an early return to normal bookings, we expect
 airfares (which fell 13% last year) to rise by between 5% to 10% due to the
 positive impact of our new routes and bases.  Some of these, such as Faro and
 Malaga, are already producing higher fares during the summer although they will
 lead to a 10% increase in sector length.  Q1 will be adversely impacted by
 weaker yields in May and June due to the volcanic ash disruptions, and the
 inclusion of part of Easter revenues in the prior period, as a result Q1 Net
 Profits are expected to be slightly lower than last year.    Overall we expect
 costs per passenger to rise by 4% in 2010/11 (sector length adjusted they will
 fall by 6%). If as we expect, higher yields offset increased fuel and other
 operating costs, then profits (excluding exceptional costs from the recent
 volcanic ash disruptions) for the coming year should rise by between 10% to 15%
 to a range of approx. EUR350m to EUR375m".
ENDS.
Note 1 - March 2010 excludes an exceptional item of EUR13.5m for the impairment of
 our investment in Aer Lingus.
The comparable year end March 2009 excludes exceptional items of i) accelerated
 depreciation of EUR51.6m on aircraft disposals in financial years ended 31 March,
 2009 and 2010 and ii) a further EUR222.5m impairment of our investment in Aer
 Lingus to a year end value of EUR93.2m.

 factors and specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an
 airline operating in the European economy.  Among the factors that are subject
 to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results are the
 airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing
 carriers, market prices for the replacement aircraft, costs associated with
 environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K.,
 European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory
 agencies, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport
 access and charges, labour relations, the economic environment of the airline
 industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the UK and Continental
 Europe, the general willingness of passengers to travel and other economics,
 social and political factors.
Ryanair is the World's favourite airline with 42 bases and 1100+ low fare routes
 across 26 countries, connecting 155 destinations. Ryanair operates a fleet of
 247 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft with firm orders for a further 75 new aircraft
 (before taking account of planned disposals), which will be delivered over the
 next 2 years. Ryanair currently has a team of more than 7,000 people and expects
 traffic to grow to 73.5 million passengers in the current fiscal year.

Ryanair Holdings plc
 Notes forming Part of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
 Preliminary Financial Statements
1.  Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland.  The
 unaudited condensed consolidated preliminary financial statements of the Company
 for the year ended March 31, 2010 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries
 (together referred to as the "Group").
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 31,
 2009 are available at www.ryanair.com.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial information included in the
 preliminary announcement is prepared based on accounting policies which are
 consistent with those accounting policies applied in the 2009 annual report.
 The condensed consolidated financial information for the year ended March 31,
 2010 is prepared in accordance with the measurement principles of IFRS as
 adopted by the EU and in compliance with the measurement principles of IFRSs as
 issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, which are effective at
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results -9-
 March 31, 2010.
The condensed consolidated financial information presented herein does not
 constitute the Company's statutory financial statements for the years ended
 March 31, 2010 and 2009, within the meaning of the Companies (Amendment) Act,
 1986. The statutory financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2010 will
 be finalised on the basis of the financial information presented by the
 directors in this preliminary results announcement and, together with the
 independent auditor's report thereon, will be filed with the Irish Registrar of
 Companies following the Company's Annual General Meeting and will also be
 available on the Company's website.  The 2010 annual report and consolidated
 financial statements will be circulated to shareholders shortly.  Statutory
 financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2009 have been filed with the
 Irish Registrar of Companies.  The independent auditor's report on those
 financial statements was unqualified.
The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors,
 approved the preliminary financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2010
 on May 27, 2010.
The following new standards and amendments to standards were adopted by the
 Group for the first time for the financial year beginning April 1, 2009.
·    IFRS 8 - Operating Segments ("IFRS 8").  We adopted IFRS 8 which replaces
 IAS 14 - Segmental Reporting ("IAS 14"), during the year ended March 31, 2010.
 IFRS 8 requires a "management approach" under which segment information is
 presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.  IAS
 14 required identification of two sets of segments - one based on business units
 and the other on geographical areas.  IFRS 8 requires additional disclosures
 around identifying segments and their products and services.  Our operations are
 organised as a single business unit, which is the provision of low-fares
 airline-related activities, including scheduled services, car hire, internet
 income and related sales to third parties.  There has been no change to the
 operating segment as a result of the adoption of IFRS 8 and the reportable
 segment is consistent with that previously reported under the primary business
 segment format of the segment reporting under IAS 14.  The additional
 disclosures around identifying segments and their products and services will be
 disclosed in the 2010 annual financial statements.  Comparative segment
 information will be represented, where necessary, in conformity with the
 requirements of IFRS 8.  Since the change in accounting policy only impacts the
 presentation and disclosure aspects, there is no impact on reported results or
 earnings per share.
·    IAS 1 (revised) - Presentation of Financial Statements.  The revised
 standard prohibits the presentation of items of income and expenses (that is
 "non owner changes in equity") within the statement of changes in equity,
 therefore requiring "non owner changes in equity" to be presented separately
 from owner changes in equity.  All "non owner changes in equity" are required to
 be shown in a performance statement.  Entities can choose whether to present one
 performance statement (the statement of comprehensive income) or two statements
 (the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income).  We have
 elected to present two statements: an income statement and a statement of
 comprehensive income.  Also, the revised standard includes the statement of
 changes in shareholders' equity as a primary statement, rather than as a note to
 the financial statements.  Since the change in accounting policy only impacts
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results -9-
 the presentation and disclosure aspects, there is no impact on reported results
 or earnings per share.
·    Amendment to IFRS 7 "Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments".
 The relevant aspects of the amendment will be addressed in the 2010 Annual
 Report disclosures.
 We have considered all IFRS standards, amendments to these standards and IFRIC
 interpretations that have been issued, but which are not yet effective, and have
 not been early adopted in these financial statements.  The following revised and
 new standards and interpretations will be adopted in future financial
 statements, where applicable.  We do not anticipate that the adoption of these
 new or revised standards and interpretations will have a material impact on our
 financial position or results from operations.
 ·   IFRS 3 (revised 2008), "Business Combinations" (effective for new
 acquisitions occurring in financial years beginning on or after July 1, 2009).
·    Amendment to IAS 27, "Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements"
 (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after July 1, 2009).
·    Amendments to IAS 39, "Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement:
 Eligible Hedged Items" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after July
 1, 2009).
·    IFRIC 17, "Distribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners", (effective for
 fiscal periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009).
·    On April 16, 2009 the IASB published its second annual improvements
 project, "Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards 2009".
 Effective dates are dealt with on a standard-by-standard basis.
·    Amendments to IFRS 2 "Share-based Payment - Group Cash-settled Share-based
 Payment Transactions" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after
 January 1, 2010).
·    Amendment to IAS 32 "Financial Instruments: Presentation - Classification
 of Rights Issues" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after February
 1, 2010).
·    IFRIC 19 "Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity
 Instruments" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after July 1, 2010).
·    IAS 24 (revised 2009), "Related Party Disclosures", (revised 2009)
 (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2011).
·    Amendments to IFRIC 14 "IAS 19 - The Limit on a Defined Benefit Assets,
 Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction" (effective for fiscal
 periods beginning on or after January 1, 2011).
·    IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments"(effective for fiscal periods beginning on or
 after January 1, 2013).
·    On May 6, 2010 the IASB published its third annual improvements project,
 "Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards 2010".  Effective
 dates are dealt with on a standard-by-standard basis.
Exceptional items
 The Company presents certain items separately, which are unusual, by virtue of
 their size and incidence, in the context of our ongoing core operations, as we
 believe this presentation represents the underlying business more accurately and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results -9-
 reflects the manner in which investors typically analyse the results.  In the
 current and prior period comparative we have presented an impairment of a
 financial asset investment as an exceptional item.  In the prior year
 comparative we have presented accelerated depreciation related to aircraft
 disposals and the impairment of our investment in Aer Lingus separately because
 of the unusual nature of these items.  Any amounts deemed "exceptional" for
 management discussion and analysis purposes have been classified for the
 purposes of the IFRS income statement in the same way as non exceptional amounts
 of the same nature.
2.  Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements,
 estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.  Actual
 results may differ from these estimates.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements
 made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key
 sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the
 most recent published consolidated financial statements.
3.  Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to
 quarter, and management expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors
 causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to general
 economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly the
 first half-year typically results in substantially higher revenues and results.
4.  Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the
 year ended March 31, 2010 was 10.1% (2009:  negative 12.1%).  The tax charge for
 the year ended March 31, 2010 of EUR35.7m (2009: tax credit EUR11.3m) primarily

Reconciliation of results for the year under IFRS to adjusted results for the
 year ended March 31, 2010
The condensed consolidated preliminary income statement for year ended March 31,
 2010, as set forth on page 5 of this preliminary announcement, presents the
 results for the year separately between pre-exceptional and exceptional items.
 Certain items are presented separately, as exceptional items, which, by virtue
 of their size or incidence, are unusual in the context of the Group's ongoing
 core operations, as we believe this presentation represents the underlying
 business more accurately and reflects the manner in which investors typically
 analyse the results.
In the current year we have presented an impairment of a financial asset
 investment as an exceptional item.  Any amounts deemed "exceptional" for
 management discussion and analysis purposes have been classified for the
 purposes of the IFRS income statement in the same way as non exceptional amounts

 of the same nature.

 for basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share as the effect of all
 potentially dilutive ordinary shares of 2.7m outstanding was anti-dilutive.
11.  Property, plant and equipment
 Acquisitions and disposals
 During the year ended March 31, 2010, the Group acquired assets with a cost of
 EUR997.8m (March 31, 2009: EUR702.0m).  Three Boeing 737-800 aircraft and two spare
 engines were disposed of during the year, generating sales proceeds of EUR89.2m.
12.  Post balance sheet events
 (i)  A volcanic ash cloud covered most of Northern Europe between April 15, and
 April 22, 2010 which resulted in the closure of airspace for almost all of this
 period.  In addition, on various dates in May there were more airspace closures.
 These closures resulted in the cancellation of 9,490 flights for 1.5M
 passengers.  In addition, under EU 261/2004, the Company is required to either
 refund passengers the cost of their cancelled flights or, in the case of
 passengers who had already travelled, to reimburse them for reasonable receipted
 accommodation, meals and other expenses.  The Company expects to refund these
 monies and reimburse passengers reasonable expenses although it will take a
 substantial period of time to complete this and management estimates that the
 approximate costs of this and the non recoverable fiscal costs incurred during
 the cancellations will be in the order of EUR50M.
 (ii)  The directors, subject to shareholder approval at the Company's AGM in
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results -11-
 September 2010, have proposed a one off dividend of EUR500m for the year ended
 March 31, 2010 to be paid in October 2010.
13.  US GAAP Reconciliation
 Following on from the issuance by the SEC of Rule 3235 "Acceptance from Foreign
 Private Issuers of Financial Statements prepared in accordance with
 International Financial Reporting Standards without reconciliation to US GAAP",
 the Group has chosen to exclude a US GAAP Reconciliation from these preliminary
 financial statements.
14.  Related party transactions
 We have related party relationships with our subsidiaries, directors and senior
 key management personnel. All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on
 consolidation and are not disclosed.
 There were no related party transactions in the year ended March 31, 2010 that
 materially affected the financial position or the performance of the Company
 during that period and there were no changes in the related party transactions
 described in the 2009 Annual Report that could have a material effect on the
 financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.

 comprises a deferred tax charge relating to temporary differences for property,
 plant and equipment recognised in the income statement and the utilisation of
 previous trading losses.
5.  Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most
 recent published consolidated financial statements.  The charge to the income
 statement in the year of approximately EUR4.9m (2009: EUR3.8m) is related to the
 fair value of various share options granted in prior periods, which are being
 recognised within the income statement in accordance with employee services
 rendered.
6.  Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its
 business.  The Group does not believe that any such litigation will individually
 or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
 Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, management
 believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not
 expected to materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or
 financial position.
7.  Capital commitments
 At March 31, 2010 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 232 (2009: 181) Boeing
 737-800 aircraft.  It also had firm orders for an additional 90 Boeing
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results -10-
 737-800's.  The delivery of these firm order aircraft will increase the fleet
 size (net of planned disposals) to 299 aircraft by March 31, 2013.
8.  Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR93.2m at March 31,
 2009 to EUR116.2m at March 31, 2010 is comprised of an impairment charge of EUR13.5m
 on its shareholding in Aer Lingus, recognised in the income statement,
 reflecting a further decline in the Aer Lingus share price from EUR0.59 per share
 at March 31, 2009 to EUR0.50 at June 30, 2009.  This impairment charge is offset
 by a gain of EUR36.5m, recognised through other comprehensive income, reflecting
 the subsequent increase in the share price to EUR0.73 per share at March 31, 2010.
 All impairment losses are required to be recognised in the income statement and
 are not subsequently reversed, while gains are recognised through other
 comprehensive income.
9.  Analysis of operating segment
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares
 airline-related activities, including scheduled services, car hire, internet
 income and related sales to third parties.   The Company operates a single fleet
 of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 As of April 1, 2009 the Company determines and presents operating segments based
 on the information that internally is provided to the CEO, who is the Company's
 Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource allocation
 decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource
 allocation decisions are made based on the entire route network and the
 deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in type.  The
 objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated
 financial results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated
 adjusted profit/(loss) after tax of the Company for the year. This measure
 excludes the effects of certain income and expense items, which are unusual, by
 virtue of their size and incidence, in the context of the Company's ongoing core
 operations, such as the impairment of a financial asset investment and
 accelerated depreciation related to aircraft disposals (see reconciliation on
 page 9).
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company
 has a single reportable segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which
 is flexibly employed across the Company's integrated route network and is
 directly attributable to its reportable segment operations.  In addition, as the
 Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and liabilities
 have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
 There have been no changes to the basis of segmentation or the measurement basis
 for the segment profit or loss since March 31, 2009.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

Accelerated depreciation of EUR51.6m arose on aircraft disposed in the financial
 year 2009 and agreements to dispose of aircraft in financial year 2010, to write
 these aircraft down to their recoverable amounts when disposal occurs, thus
 leading to no gain or loss on disposal.
Impairment charge:  During the current year the Group recorded an impairment
 charge of EUR13.5m (2009: EUR222.5m) on its Aer Lingus shareholding reflecting the
 decline in the Aer Lingus share price from EUR0.59 per share at March 31, 2009 to
 EUR0.50 per share at June 30, 2009. (2009: EUR2.00 per share at March 31, 2008 to
 EUR0.59 per share at March 31, 2009).   These shares are currently trading at
 approx. EUR0.71 per share.
Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Operating and Financial Overview
Introduction
For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") all figures
 and comments are by reference to the adjusted income statement excluding the
 exceptional items referred to below.  A reconciliation of the results for the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results -8-
 year under IFRS to the adjusted results is provided on page 9.
Exceptional items in the year ended March 31, 2010 amounted to EUR13.5m reflecting
 an impairment of the Aer Lingus shareholding recorded in the quarter to June 30,
 2009.  Exceptional items in the year ended March 31, 2009 amounted to EUR274.1m
 consisting of an impairment of the Aer Lingus shareholding of EUR222.5m and an
 accelerated depreciation charge of EUR51.6m on aircraft disposed in financial
 years 2009 and 2010.
Adjusted profit after tax excluding exceptional items increased by EUR213.9m to
 EUR318.8m.  Including exceptional items the profit after tax for the year amounted
 to EUR305.3m compared to a loss of EUR169.2m in the year ended March 31, 2009.
 Summary year ended March 31, 2010
Adjusted profit after tax increased by EUR213.9m to EUR318.8m compared to EUR104.9m in
 the year ended March 31, 2009 primarily due to a 29% decrease in fuel costs,
 partially offset by a 13% decline in average fares.  Total operating revenues
 increased by 2% to EUR2,988.1m as average fares fell by 13% due to the recession,
 price promotions, and the adverse impact of the movement in euro/sterling
 exchange rates.  Ancillary revenues grew by 11% to EUR663.6m, lower than the
 increase in passenger volumes, due to a decline in average spend per passenger
 primarily due to lower excess baggage revenues, and the negative impact of the
 movement in euro/sterling exchange rates.  Total revenue per passenger as a
 result decreased by 11%, whilst the Load Factor increased by 1 point to 82%
 during the year.
Total operating expenses fell by 8% to EUR2,586.0m, primarily due to lower fuel
 prices, offset by the higher level of activity and increased operating costs
 associated with the growth of the airline.  Fuel, which represents 35% of total
 operating costs compared to 45% in the prior year, decreased by 29% to EUR893.9m
 due to the fall in the price per gallon paid offset by a 13% increase in the
 number of hours flown.  Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 3% and including fuel
 they fell by 19%.  Operating margin increased by 8 points to 13% whilst
 operating profit increased by EUR257.9m to EUR402.1m.
Net margins increased to 11% from 4% at March 31, 2009 for the reasons outlined
 above.
Adjusted earnings per share for the year were 21.59 cent compared to 7.10 cent
 in the previous year ended March 31, 2009.
Balance sheet
 Total cash and cash equivalents remained strong at EUR2,813.4m.  The Group
 generated cash from operating activities of EUR871.5m and a further EUR89.2m
 delivery proceeds on the sale of three Boeing 737-800 aircraft (and two spare
 engines) which partially funded capital expenditure incurred during the year.
 Capital expenditure of EUR997.8m largely consisted of advance aircraft payments
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results -8-
 for future aircraft deliveries and the delivery of 42 new Boeing 737-800
 aircraft in the year.  Total debt, net of repayments, increased by EUR557.8m to
 EUR2,956.2m during the year.  Net debt at year end was EUR142.8m.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis year ended March 31, 2010
Adjusted profit after tax, increased by EUR213.9m to EUR318.8m primarily due to
 lower fuel costs, partially offset by a 13% decline in average fares.  Total
 operating revenues increased by 2% to EUR2,988.1m as average fares fell by 13% due
 to the recession, price promotions, the adverse impact of the movement in
 euro/sterling exchange rates and a 2% decline in ancillary revenues per
 passenger, offset by a 14% increase in passenger numbers.  Fuel, which
 represents 35% of total operating costs compared to 45% in the prior year,
 decreased by 29% to EUR893.9m due to the fall in the price per gallon paid offset
 by an increase in the number of hours flown.  Unit costs excluding fuel fell by
 3% and including fuel they fell by 19%.   Operating margin, as a result,
 increased by 8 points to 13%, whilst operating profit increased by EUR257.9m to
 EUR402.1m.
Total operating revenues increased by 2% to EUR2,988.1m, as a 13% decline in
 average fares was offset by a 14% increase in passenger traffic to 66.5m.
Total revenue per passenger decreased by 11% due to a 2% decline in ancillary
 revenues per passenger and a 13% fall in average fares.
Scheduled passenger revenues decreased by 1% to EUR2,324.5m due to a 14% rise in
 passenger volumes offset by a 13% decrease in average fares, due to the
 recession, price promotions, lower baggage penetration rates, and the adverse
 impact of the movement in euro/sterling exchange rates.  Load factor increased
 by 1 point to 82%, compared to the year ended March 31, 2009.
Ancillary revenues increased by 11% to EUR663.6m, slower than the 14% increase in
 passenger volume, due to a 2% decline in average spend per passenger primarily
 due to lower excess baggage revenues, and the adverse impact of the movement in
 euro/sterling exchange rates.
Total operating expenses decreased by 8% to EUR2,586.0m due to the 29% decrease in
 fuel costs and 3% unit cost reductions (excluding fuel) delivered in the year
 offset partially by the higher level of activity and costs associated with the
 growth of the airline.
Staff costs increased by 8% to EUR335.0m.  This reflects a 10% increase in average
 headcount to 7,032, offset by the impact of, a company wide pay freeze, the
 higher portion of contract crew operating during the year, and the rise in cabin
 crew numbers during the year who earn lower than the average salary.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 15% to EUR235.4m.  This reflects, net
 of disposals, an additional 39 lower cost 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this
 year compared to the year ended March 31, 2009.
Fuel costs decreased by 29% to EUR893.9m primarily due to the decline in fuel
 prices offset by an increase in the number of hours flown.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results -8-
Maintenance costs increased by 29% to EUR86.0m due to, a combination of, an
 increase in the average number of leased aircraft from 40 to 50, additional
 costs arising from increased line maintenance activity at new bases, and
 handback provisions for leased aircraft due to be returned in 2010 and 2011.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 22% to EUR95.5m, which is lower than the 25%
 increase in the average number of leased aircraft from 40 to 50, reflecting the
 positive impact of lower lease rentals achieved.
Route charges rose by 17% to EUR336.3m due to an increase in the number of sectors
 flown and an increase in average unit rates, offset by the positive impact of
 euro/sterling exchange rates.
Airport & handling charges increased by 4% to EUR459.1m due to a 14% increase in
 passenger volumes, offset by lower costs at new airports and bases launched and
 savings achieved on handling costs.
Marketing, distribution and other expenses decreased by 5% to EUR144.8m, due to
 cost reductions achieved, and the increased focus on internet based promotions.
Operating margin increased by 8 points to 13% due to the reasons outlined above
 and operating profits have increased by EUR257.9m to EUR402.1m compared to the year
 ended March 31, 2009.
Finance income decreased by 69% to EUR23.5m primarily due to a combination of
 lower deposit interest rates and the impact of the placement of funds with
 highly rated and guaranteed financial institutions which typically provide a
 lower yield.
Finance expense decreased by 45% to EUR72.1m primarily due to the impact of lower
 interest rates offset by the drawdown of additional debt to part finance the
 purchase of new aircraft.
Foreign exchange losses during the year of EUR1.0m are primarily due to the impact
 of movements in sterling against the euro.
Balance sheet
 Total cash and cash equivalents remained strong at EUR2,813.4m.  The Group
 generated cash from operating activities of EUR871.5m and a further EUR89.2m
 delivery proceeds on the sale of three Boeing 737-800 aircraft (and two spare

 during the year to EUR2,956.2m.  Net debt at year end was EUR142.8m.
Shareholders' equity at March 31, 2010 increased by EUR423.5m to EUR2,848.6m
 compared to March 31, 2009 due to the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for

"When I started this one-man crusade 2 years ago, to stop this stupid arms-race
 of who is going to buy more aircraft for the sake of buying more aircraft,
 Michael O'Leary said, 'When the Queen knighted Stelios she hit him a bit hard
 with the sword . . . He is suffering concussion. Looking for a dividend from an
 airline is absurd,' (Michael O'Leary, Financial Times, 19 November 2008).
 I never thought the day would come so quickly when I would be able to say,
 'Thank you, Michael'.
 Obviously I hope Carolyn McCall and Mike Rake are watching this closely. I would
 expect nothing less from easyJet."

 Ryanair WELCOMES SWEDISH Court Decision TO REJECT Passenger Compensation CLAIM
 RYANAIR CALLS ON ARN AND RAD&RON TO APOLOGISE TO CONSUMERS FOR MISLEADING THEM
 AND FOR WRONGLY BLACKLISTING RYANAIR
 Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, today (26th May) welcomed the decision
 of the Svea Court of Appeal in Stockholm which declared that passengers are not
 entitled to compensation in cases where extraordinary circumstances apply, as
 the court overturned the decision of the District Court of Nykoping which
 awarded two passengers compensation (even though it accepted extraordinary
 circumstances were present) in breach of the provisions of EU261.
Ryanair again called on the ARN and RAD&RON to properly apply the EU261
 regulations and stop misleading Swedish passengers on compensation claims.
 Ryanair called for an end to its blacklisting for not paying compensation when
 EU261 confirms that passengers are not entitled to any such payments in
 extraordinary circumstances.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
"This decision of the Svea Court of Appeal reinforces the provisions of the
 EU261 which provides that no compensation is due to passengers in cases governed
 by extraordinary circumstances which are beyond an airlines' control. We
 understand that delayed flights can be frustrating.  However, airlines must
Ryanair Holdings PLC Welcomes Swedish Court Decision on Compensation
 always take decisions which prioritise the safety of our passengers, crew and
 aircraft over convenience.
"We now call on the ARN and RAD&RON to adhere to properly apply the EU261
 regulations and stop misleading passengers with incorrect advice about
 compensation payments which passengers are not entitled to in cases of
 extraordinary circumstances".

 to provide and operate the optical fibre network which underpins National Grid's
 core operational functions and a 5-year, GBP99 million dedicated contract for a
 Managed Service for the overall Operational Telecommunications Network

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES EUR25M MAINTENANCE AND CREW TRAINING FACILITY IN FRANKFURT HAHN
 AIRPORT
 RYANAIR TO CREATE UP TO 200 NEW JOBS IN FRANKFURT HAHN AIRPORT
 Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, today (Thursday, 20th May 2010)
 announced that it will build a new maintenance hangar, flight simulator and
 cabin crew training facility at Frankfurt Hahn Airport at a cost of approx EUR25m
 which will create up to 200 new jobs.  Details of the facility, which will be
 fully operational by December 2010, were revealed in Mainz by Minister of State
 for Economics & Transport Mr Hendrik Hering and Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary.
 The Rhineland-Palatinate Government and Frankfurt Hahn Airport secured this
 7,000 sq/m hangar investment following an extended (and intense) competition
 with three other airports in Europe.  This new EUR25m facility can accommodate up
 to two 737-800 aircraft side by side, and it will maintain a large portion of
 Ryanair's 240 aircraft fleet while the training centre will house up to 16
 classrooms, two pilot training flight simulators, a full size aircraft fuselage
 and 70 bedrooms to facilitate training courses for new and existing Ryanair
 crews from August.  Ryanair's 54 routes to/from its Frankfurt Hahn base delivers
 4m passengers p.a. which sustain 4,000 local jobs, including those of over 400
 Ryanair cabin crew, pilots and engineers at Frankfurt Hahn Airport.
 Wrapping up a great day for Germany, Ryanair celebrated its inaugural flights
 from Frankfurt Hahn to Greece with two on time departures at 7:30am to Kos and
 12:40pm to Volos today.
Ryanair Holdings PLC EUR25M Maintenance Facility in Frankfurt Hahn
 Speaking at the Ministerium in Mainz, Michael O'Leary said:
 "Ryanair wishes to thank Minister Hering, the Rhineland-Palatinate Government
 and Frankfurt Hahn Airport for their help and support in winning this new EUR25m
 hangar and training facility, which will deliver up to 200 new Ryanair jobs in
 Frankfurt Hahn, following an intense competition with three other European
 airports.  This new investment and these new jobs further strengthens Ryanair's
 presence in Frankfurt Hahn and in Germany".
 Welcoming Ryanair's new investment and jobs Minister Hendrik Hering said:
"I am delighted that Ryanair is strengthening its operations in Frankfurt Hahn
 and this announcement demonstrates that Hahn has the quality infrastructure and
 skilled workforce to secure this major project, having fought-off competition
 from a number of other European airports.
"Ryanair makes a substantial contribution to Germany's economy through
 encouraging tourism and business traffic at Frankfurt Hahn and the other seven
 German airports Ryanair operates from".
Jörg Schumacher, CEO Frankfurt Hahn Airport, said:
"Ryanair's decision to invest further in Frankfurt-Hahn is a great sign of trust
 and confidence and proves that Frankfurt-Hahn Airport has provided an excellent
 location for Ryanair over the past years".

 RYANAIR REJECTS FALSE CLAIMS ABOUT ITS MARSEILLE OPERATIONS
ALL RYANAIR CREW PAY TAX, SOCIAL INSURANCE AND
 PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS AS REQUIRED BY EU LAW
RYANAIR NOTIFIES CREWS IT WILL CLOSE MARSEILLE BASE IN NOVEMBER IF CHALLENGED BY
 AIX-EN-PROVENCE PROSECUTOR
UP TO 1M PASSENGERS AND 1,000 JOBS WILL BE LOST AT MARSEILLE
Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, today (Thursday, 20th May 2010) rejected
 the false claims made recently about Ryanair's contracts, employees and their
 tax arrangements at its Marseille base.  Ryanair condemned the false and
 misleading article in Le Figaro (2nd May) which followed their journalist's
 refusal to put his queries to Ryanair in advance, and then his failure to
 accurately report Ryanair's response which confirmed that "all Ryanair
 employment contracts comply with EU laws".
Ryanair has invested over EUR300m in its Marseille base since 2006 comprising four
 new B737 aircraft - all of them Irish registered (and therefore Irish territory)
 - over 120 pilots and cabin crew operating a network of 26 mainly international
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Reject False Claims re Marseille Opertions
 flights.  Since the launch of  the base in 2006, Ryanair's traffic at Marseille
 has risen from 200,000 to over 1.7m in 2010, with Ryanair bringing almost 1m
 inbound visitors annually to Marseille (and Aix-en-Provence), sustaining over
 1,500 local jobs in and around Marseille Airport.
Ryanair corrected a number of false claims in the Le Figaro (2nd May) article
 (which was the basis for many subsequent false reports of this issue) as
 follows:
1.   The activities of Ryanair's 120 employees take place on Irish territory
 (Irish aircraft) and not "in France" under the EU Transport Workers
 Regulations.
2.   All Ryanair's people operating Irish registered aircraft from Marseille are
 employed under Irish contracts, are paid in Ireland, and pay full labour taxes,
 social security and their pension obligations in Ireland, where they are
 paid.
3.   Since average pay in Ryanair is higher than it is in Air France, and since
 these people comply with EU laws by paying Irish tax and Irish social security
 arising from their work in Irish territory, there is no truth to the allegations
 of "clandestine work" or "illegal labour" or "social dumping" as falsely claimed
 in the Le Figaro article.
4.   The claim that this structure results in "considerable savings" is clearly
 untrue, since the average pay in Ryanair is higher than the average pay in Air
 France.
Ryanair is currently taking an action in the European Court of Human Rights
 against France to challenge a 2007 decree which attempts to impose unfair and
 restrictive legislation on international transport companies in France.  This
 French decree which was introduced after Ryanair's Marseille base was announced
 in May 2006 is contrary to the EU principles of free movement of labour within
 the EU.   Ryanair's Marseille operation fully complies with all EU laws and
 regulations relating to transport employees and employment contracts. Ryanair's
 policy of issuing Irish contracts to crew operating on Irish aircraft has
 already been upheld by the courts in Belgium, Germany and Spain which found that
 crews who operate on Irish registered aircraft are correctly employed in Ireland
 in accordance with EU law.
Ryanair has cooperated fully with recent enquiries from the Aix-en-Provence
 Prosecutor's Office and has demonstrated that it fully complies with EU
 Transport Workers Regulations.  Ryanair today announced that if the
 Aix-en-Provence Prosecutor's Office launches Court proceedings challenging
 Ryanair's employment or contractual arrangements at Marseille under this new
 French Decree (which is currently under appeal to the European Court of Human
 Rights), then Ryanair will close its Marseille base at the end of the current
 Summer schedule (October), and from November it will only fly to/from Marseille
 on aircraft which are based outside France, and all of the mobile crews in
 Marseille will also be transferred to non French bases.  This will mean
 that;
·    four Irish registered aircraft will be transferred to other non French
 bases in the EU,
 ·    the loss of 120 Ryanair jobs at Marseille, as crews are transferred
 elsewhere in Europe,
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Reject False Claims re Marseille Opertions
 ·    a reduction in the number of Ryanair's daily flights at Marseille from 33
 to 16,
 ·    a 1,000,000 cut in Ryanair's traffic at Marseille from over 1.7m to under
 800,000 p.a.,
 ·    a cut in jobs supported by Ryanair at Marseille from 1,600 to less than
 600,
 ·    a cut in the number of Ryanair routes served to/from Marseille Airport from
 26 to 16.
Ryanair regrets (and hopes to avoid) this Marseille base closure, but it is not
 prepared to have its lawful contractual arrangements subjected to false
 reporting in the French media or what it believes would be an unlawful
 prosecution (under current EU law) by Aix-en-Provence investigators.  If
 Ryanair's EUR300m investment and 120 jobs in Marseille Airport are not welcome,
 then Ryanair will relocate these aircraft, these jobs and these passengers
 elsewhere in Europe, where airports are clamouring to attract Ryanair, its
 aircraft, its employees, its traffic and its jobs.
Speaking today in Paris, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"Ryanair sincerely regrets the false and inaccurate claims made recently about
 our Marseille base in the French press, which failed to report Ryanair's
 response.  These allegations were inaccurate and designed to damage Ryanair's
 operations in Marseille, as well as our investment in France.  All of Ryanair's
 mobile employees are employed on lawful EU contracts.  They are required to -
 and do - pay taxes, social insurance and pension fees in accordance with EU
 regulations as a condition of their employment in Ryanair.
"We are not prepared to have our good name and reputation damaged by these
 unattributed leaks in the French media or by an unjustified ongoing
 investigation in Aix-en- Provence.  If the French authorities, or the French
 regions, don't want Ryanair to invest in bases and jobs at their regional
 airports, then we will simply move those aircraft and jobs elsewhere in Europe.
"This has happened before, where Ryanair flights on the Strasbourg-London route
 were blocked by an Air France Court action in 2003.  As a result traffic on the
 Strasbourg-London route has collapsed by over 85% from over 150,000 passengers
 p.a in 2003, to less than 20,000 in 2009, while Ryanair moved these flights and
 jobs across the border to Baden Baden, where traffic has increased from zero in
 2003 to over 500,000 p.a. in 2009.  France's loss has been Germany's gain.  It
 is disappointing to note that having forced Ryanair off the route, Air France
 subsequently reduced their traffic on the Strasbourg-London route by more than
 50% through high fares, fuel surcharges and reduced flight frequencies.
"Should the Aix-en-Provence authorities initiate any Court action against
 Ryanair's lawful Marseille operations, then jobs, traffic and inward investment
 will be lost in Marseille.  The only people who benefit will be Air France, who
 will again have eliminated competition, while consumers and visitors at
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Reject False Claims re Marseille Opertions
 Marseille will suffer higher fares.
"We would also respectfully request that Le Figaro or any other French newspaper
 wishing to write an article of false claims about Ryanair, would at least extend
 us the courtesy of sending us these claims in advance of publication, allowing
 us to respond and then accurately reporting our response.  We sincerely regret
 that Le Figaro didn't bother with these basic courtesies of a free press in this
 instance".

 RYANAIR DISMISSES ENAC'S FALSE CLAIMS OF 178 VIOLATIONS OF EU261 AND THEIR EUR3M
 FINE
Ryanair, Italy's favourite airline, today (Tuesday, 18th May 2010) condemned
 what it believes are the latest biased actions of ENAC which announced on
 Saturday that it had fined Ryanair EUR3m for 178 alleged violations of EU261
 between Sat 17th and Thur 22nd April last.
Ryanair today confirmed that it will vigorously defend/appeal any such fines if
 or when it receives any notification of them.  Ryanair finds it strange that no
 such violations (or fines) have even today been brought to its attention by
 ENAC, who appear to have "investigated" and "fined" Ryanair in 178 separate
 cases without even allowing Ryanair any opportunity to defend or respond to
 these alleged claims.  Ryanair pointed out the following facts:
1.   During the disruptions from 17th to 22nd April, all Ryanair passengers in
 Italy were provided with the EU261 Notice either by Ryanair's handling agents or
 through Ryanair's website, where all passengers were directed for info and/or
 rebooking.
2.   Many disrupted passengers in Italy were offered accommodation at Ryanair's
 expense in local hotels, and those that couldn't be accommodated (because of the

 hotel expenses to Ryanair at the end of their trips.  This is the same procedure
 applied by all airlines in Italy and across Europe during the week of the
 17th-22nd April and fully complies with EU261.
3.   Ryanair and its handling agents complied with its EU261 obligation and
 continues to do so.  ENAC referred to "investigations" into 178 cases, yet not
 one investigation or enquiry has been made by ENAC to Ryanair relating to any of
 these cases.  How can ENAC claim to have investigated these cases and fined
 Ryanair, without seeking any response or defence from Ryanair?
4.   ENAC cannot issue fines without first bringing the alleged violations to
 the attention of the airline, and allowing the airline to respond  to these
 allegations.  ENAC's fines are therefore unlawful and in breach of the EU261
 regulations.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
"It is extraordinary that ENAC would announce on Saturday that Ryanair has been
 fined EUR3m for 178 alleged violations of EU261, without ENAC having had the
 courtesy to notify Ryanair of any of these allegations, or allowing Ryanair an
 opportunity to explain how it complied with EU261 allegations before ENAC rushed
 to invent and then announce this alleged EUR3m fine.
"At a time when all airlines across Europe were cancelling thousands of flights
 and disrupting millions of passengers, it is extraordinary that ENAC could
 investigate and then impose a EUR3m fine only upon Ryanair, yet not any other
 airline.  This would appear to be the latest in a long series of biased, anti
 Ryanair rulings by ENAC, an organisation which has repeatedly shown its bias and
 its lack of impartiality when it comes to cases relating to Ryanair.
"In the meantime Ryanair welcomes the latest injunction secured against ENAC
 last week in which the Italian Courts have ruled that ENAC cannot prevent
 Ryanair's based aircraft landing at Rome Ciampino in the late evening.  This
 latest injunction successfully prevents ENAC from disrupting Ryanair's flights
 and passengers or forcing them to divert and land at Rome Fiumcino, instead of
 at Rome Ciampino.
"Perhaps ENAC's surprise announcement on Saturday of a EUR3m fine against Ryanair,
 for 178 claimed but unidentified breaches of EU261 is not unrelated to the fact
 that ENAC's anti Ryanair activities were the subject of yet another successful
 injunction in the Lazio Courts on Wednesday of last week.

HENDERSON EUROTRUST PLC
Interim Management Statement
 Review of the period from 1 February 2010 to 30 April 2010
The Directors of Henderson EuroTrust plc hereby announce the following:
MATERIAL EVENTS OR TRANSACTIONS DURING THE PERIOD
Portfolio Comments:
The three months since our Half Year Report have seen European markets suffer a
 period of volatility, especially during April. In spite of the concerns about
 the sovereign risk which built up in intensity during late April, markets have
 generally chosen to concentrate on better economic news from Europe and more
 particularly the USA. The Company has been performing well, helped by gearing
 which reached a peak of about 7.5% of the portfolio/assets in March.
Henderson Eurotrust Interim Management Statement
During the period we have sold a number of positions, including the Finnish
 insurance company Sampo, Irish low cost carrier Ryanair, Daimler, Deutsche
 Telekom and Synthes, the Swiss listed orthopaedics company. On the purchase side
 we invested in the new issue by Kabel Deutschland (German cable television), and
 returned to holding Philips and Adecco.
Given the recent market turmoil surrounding Greece and some other Eurozone
 members it is worth pointing out that we have not held any positions in the
 Greek market for some years and while we did have a position in Galp, a
 Portuguese company during the three months those shares were sold at a small
 profit before the end of April. In Spain our only current holding is still
 Inditex. The investments we hold are therefore predominantly "Northern"
 European, by country of listing.
We purchased some more of our own shares during the three months, when the
 discount widened to what in our opinion, were unreasonably high levels.
Outlook:
After a strong rise (especially in March) it was likely that any excuse would be
 found to cause a consolidation in the market While economic news has continued
 to be encouraging, equities have perhaps justifiably been intensely concerned by
 the crisis surrounding "Sovereign Debt" (ie debt at too high a level in most
 countries, but especially Greece). Clearly, with the benefit of hindsight,
 Greece should either have never been allowed to become a member of the Euro, or
 having taken a more relaxed attitude towards her fiscal position, she should at
 least have tried to reduce borrowing during the more recent "better" years. The
 recently announced IMF and ECB packages of aid should help avert an immediate
 crisis, and will have undoubtedly alerted those countries erring on the side of
 too much borrowing (Spain, Portugal - and yes the UK too are frequently being
 mentioned) to take action now to improve their fiscal balance.

We do not anticipate a collapse of the Euro, and it is worth pointing out that
 recent Euro weakness is advantageous to European exporters. Medium term some of
 the issues raised during this crisis will need to be resolved.
Having been geared for much of the last three months, the Company now has a
 small net cash position. We may use weakness to add to existing positions if
 further falls are seen.
Gearing: At the end of the quarter the Company was 7% geared (at 31 January
 2010:  4%)
Dividends:  An interim dividend of 4.0p per ordinary share, in respect of the
 year ending 31 July 2010, was paid on 30 April 2010 to holders on the Register
 of Members on 6 April 2010.  The ex-dividend date was 31 March 2010.
Henderson Eurotrust Interim Management Statement
Discount: The share price discount to net asset value at 30 April 2010 was 12.1%
 (at 31 January 2010: 7.5%)
Share Capital:  During the three month period the Company bought back 206,860
 shares, all of which were placed in Treasury. Accordingly, the issued share
 capital at 30 April 2010 was 22,968,063 ordinary shares of 5 pence each and the
 total number of voting rights was 20,960,065.
There are no other material events or transactions to report.

 RYANAIR WELCOMES EU CONFIRMATION THAT NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS MUST COMPENSATE
 AIRLINES FOR EU AIRSPACE CLOSURE
Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, welcomed today's (27 April 10) confirmation
 by EU Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas that National Governments would have to
 compensate airlines for the losses suffered following the unnecessary and
 inappropriate closure of European airspace by those EU Governments over the past
 week.
Ryanair confirmed that it has written to the Irish Dept. of Transport expressing
 its opposition to any State Aid for airlines, but proposing four simple and
 effective relief measures, which are within the power of the Dept of Transport
 and the Irish Government to initiate as follows:
1.   Ryanair has called for the 40% price increases currently planned by the
 Govt owned DAA airports from 1 May to be deferred for a minimum period of 12
 months.
2.   Ryanair has called for the Irish Govt's EUR10 tourist tax to be scrapped from
 1 May.
3.   Ryanair has called for the Dept of Transport to direct the Aviation
 Regulator to reject any follow on claims for price increases by regulated
 monopolies (DAA and  IAA) seeking further price increases to compensate them for
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Response to EU Report on Volcanic Ash
 the loss of revenue during last weeks closure of Irish airspace.
4.   Ryanair has called on the Irish Govt to lead the reform of the EU261
 legislation to limit passenger rights to the amount of the air fare paid (as is
 the case for European train, ferry and coach operators) and also to limit the
 liability of airlines in cases where the problem is not within the control of
 the airlines (such as last week's Government closure of EU airspace).
Ryanair and the other Irish airlines (who have written in similar terms to the
 Dept of Transport) are waiting for a positive response from the Minister and the
 Dept.  Ryanair today confirmed that it would in time be seeking a full recovery
 from the Irish Government of all refunds to passengers, both of air fares and
 any reasonable receipted expenses, during the recent unnecessary 7 day closure
 of EU airspace by EU Governments.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said today:
"We welcome Commissioner Kallas' confirmation that EU Governments must
 compensate their airlines for the losses suffered last week through the
 unnecessary closure of EU airspace, which was not the fault of airlines.  The
 Irish Government could go a long way towards meeting these costs by implementing
 the four simple relief measures already proposed by the main  Irish airlines.
 The Irish airlines, operating as we do from an island country, were more
 severely impacted by last week's events, since passengers could not transfer to
 alternative ground transportation in order to complete their journeys.  These
 EU261 regulations weren't designed for catastrophic, prolonged closures of
 European airspace.  When even travel insurers are not obliged to pay out
 (because the cause of this was an Act of God), it is clearly unfair that
 Europe's airlines are expected to be the insurer of last resort, when the
 responsibility for passenger costs and expenses should lie with the EU's
 Governments, who were the parties that closed European airspace, not the
 airlines".

 IMPACT OF VOLCANIC ASH
 FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS ON RYANAIR
Ryanair, today (Tue 20 April 2010) confirmed that its Southbound flights from
 Spain, Italy, Malta and Morocco continue to operate normally.  Ryanair also
 announced that its flight cancellations in Northern Europe have been extended
 from 1300hrs on Wed 21 April to 1300hrs on Thur 22 April, when (on the basis of
 improved meteorological forecasts) and more accurate analysis of the volcanic
 ash over Continental Europe, Ryanair hopes to resume a substantial proportion
 (but not all) of its flight operations across Continental Europe.
Ryanair also announced that it would cancel all of its flights between Ireland
 and the UK until 13.00hrs on Fri 23 April, to allow the airline operate extra
 flights on Thurs and Fri between the UK and Continental Europe, and between
 Ireland and Continental Europe, to clear any backlog of disrupted passengers.
 Ryanair's decision to cancel its flights between Ireland and the UK was taken in
 the knowledge that the significant ferry capacity which operates between Ireland
 and the UK can continue to accommodate large volumes of passengers, albeit with
 significant delays.
Ryanair's current best estimate is that its normal flight operations will resume
Ryanair Holdings PLC Impact of Volcanic Ash Flight Cancellations
 from approx. 1300hrs on Friday 23rd April.  Ryanair has notified all of its
 airport handling agents of revised handling procedures (incl. suspending airport
 check-in fees and baggage fees) for a number of days until the backlog of
 disrupted passengers has been cleared, either on Ryanair's scheduled flights or
 the large number of extra flights which Ryanair plans to operate.  Similarly,
 while we will consider all passenger requests for reimbursement of reasonable
 receipted expenses, any such reimbursement by Ryanair will be limited to a
 maximum of the original air fare paid.
Ryanair today confirmed that the financial impact of these disruptions was not
 an immediate concern.  Providing passengers with information and reroutings
 currently takes priority over profits.  Ryanair expects its net profit for the
 year end 31 March 2011 to be impacted by approx. EUR6m per day over the seven days
 of these substantial disruptions between Thurs 15 April to Wed 22 April.
 Obviously this figure will vary depending on how long these disruptions persist,
 the number of flights which Ryanair is able to operate following resumption of
 schedules, how quickly the backlogs can be cleared, and when load factors return
 to normal.  Ryanair will provide an analysis of the likely total cost of these
 disruptions in its full year results announcement on June 1 next.

 RYANAIR DISMISSES AIR FRANCE'S FALSE CLAIMS
EU COURT HAS CONFIRMED THAT AIRPORT AGREEMENTS ARE LEGAL, AND RYANAIR DOES NOT
 RECEIVE STATE AID OR SUBSIDY
Ryanair, the world's favourite airline today (30th March 10) dismissed the
 recent false Air France claims that Ryanair receives subsidies or State Aid at
 its regional French airports.  Ryanair briefed the French media in Paris on the
 facts of the Dec 2008 European Court of First Instance (ECFI) Judgement which
 declared that Ryanair's long-term, low cost agreement at Brussels Charleroi
 Airport was lawful and so Ryanair did not receive either subsidy or State Aid.
 The ECFI held that publicly owned airports like Brussels Charleroi were free to
 enter long-term, discounted arrangements with Ryanair (and other airlines) in
 return for new route and traffic growth and in so doing, the Court dismissed the
 EU Commission's claims that Ryanair's cost base at Charleroi included State aid
 or subsidies.
The ECFI also dismissed the EU Commission's original ruling (that Ryanair's
 discounted cost agreement with Brussels Charleroi was State Aid) as an "error of
 law" which "must be annulled".  The ECFI decision totally undermined the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Dismisses Air France's False Claims
 Commission's 2005 "Airport Guidelines" which were based on the Commission's
 original unlawful Charleroi decision.
This ECFI decision proves that the recent Air France claims were false.  Because
 the French regional airports are in public ownership, does not preclude those
 airports from (a) entering into long-term, low cost arrangements with airlines
 including Ryanair, in return for new route and traffic growth or (b) providing
 lower costs to reflect those lower cost facilities which low fare airlines such
 as Ryanair actually use.  This issue was tested in the French Courts by Air
 France's challenge to Ryanair's low cost base at Marseille, where Ryanair uses
 the low cost, inferior MP2 Terminal, yet has delivered rapid traffic growth on
 international flights, whereas Air France continues to use the higher cost MP1
 Terminal for its domestic services.  Marseille Airport have repeatedly offered
 Air France (among others) lower cost facilities in the lower cost MP2 Terminal,
 yet Air France has refused to move there or to commit to the level of traffic
 growth which Ryanair has delivered.
Ryanair believes that these latest Air France claims are designed to hide the
 damage being done by Air France to French regional airports and tourism.  Air
 France is restricting the growth of regional airports and tourism, by offering
 only domestic connections to its hubs at Paris CDG and Orly.  This denies many
 regional French airports the opportunity to develop international services or
 low fare flights, which is why so many of these airports now work in partnership
 with Ryanair to develop the routes that Air France has denied them for many
 years.  Ryanair routes and tourism investment in France has the support of the
 French regions and is opposed only by Air France, which would appear to want to
 block competition and consumer choice and force millions of French consumers and
 visitors to take high fare connections across Air France's hub in Paris, rather
 than flying direct to the regional French airports.
Ryanair also highlighted at its Paris press conference that it is Air France
 which has been repeatedly found by the EU Commission to have received unlawful
 State Aid in the form of discounted airport charges on domestic routes and other
 direct State subventions.  In total Ryanair believes that Air France has already
 been proven by the European Commission to have received in excess of EUR1billion
 in unlawful State Aid since 1994. In addition, Air France's subsidiary, KLM,
 received over EUR400 million in State aid at Amsterdam airport in 2008/2009.
Speaking today in Paris, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"There is no basis for Air France's false claims that Ryanair receives subsidies
 or State Aid.  The European Court of First Instance has already analysed and
 dismissed similar claims in the case of Brussels Charleroi as recently as
 December 2008.  The European Court decision has totally undermined the EU
 Commission's 2005 "Airport Guidelines" and dooms Air France's claims to failure,
 as similar claims have previously failed in the European Courts and in the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Dismisses Air France's False Claims
 French Courts in Marseille.
"It is remarkable that Air France should falsely accuse Ryanair of receiving
 subsidies or State Aid, when it is Air France which has been repeatedly found by
 the EU Commission to have received subsidies and unlawful State Aid.  In total
 over the past 2 decades, Air France and KLM have received unlawful State Aid
 subsidies of well over EUR1bn.
"Ryanair remains committed to investing in new aircraft, new routes, traffic
 growth and jobs at the 25 regional French airports where in 2010 Ryanair will
 carry over 7m passengers, sustaining over 7,000 jobs in the regions of France.
 Our Marseille base continues to grow from strength to strength, which proves
 that there is enormous demand from French consumers/visitors for Ryanair's low
 fare direct services to the regions and we will continue to grow those services
 by investing in France, while we continue to defeat these false claims and
 misguided legal actions by Air France".

 RYANAIR'S IN-FLIGHT PHONE SERVICE TEMPORARILY ON HOLD AS ONAIR TERMINATES
 SERVICE AFTER
 13 MONTH PROVING PERIOD
Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, today (29th March 10) confirmed that
 OnAir, Ryanair's in-flight phone service provider, has notified Ryanair of their
 intention to terminate the contract after 13 months proving period of service
 operations.
Ryanair was pleased with the performance of the OnAir system and the rapidly
 growing call/text and data volumes, and had notified OnAir of its wish to roll
 the service out across the entire Ryanair fleet. OnAir were unwilling to commit
 to this expansion at this time, and exercised their right to terminate the
 agreement at the end of the 13 month proving period of service operation.
Following this successful experience with in-flight phone services, Ryanair will
 now invite other in-flight communications providers to tender for access to
 Ryanair's 73 million annual passengers on Europe's largest international
 scheduled airline.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC In-Flight Phone Service Temporarily On Hold
"Ryanair regrets that OnAir were unwilling to commit to roll out its in-flight
 phone service to all Ryanair's 230 plus aircraft fleet.  As a result OnAir has
 decided to terminate its contract after a successful 13 month proving period of
 service operation.  We wish to thank OnAir for their help and support with this
 programme to date and wish them well for the future.
"Ryanair will now invite other in-flight communications providers to tender for
 access to Ryanair's 73million passengers to develop a fleet wide in-flight phone
 service on the world's No 1 international scheduled airline".

 adviser registered under Section 203 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, is
 the beneficial owner of 17,809,830 shares or 1.206% of the Common Stock
 outstanding of RYANAIR HOLDINGS PLC  ("the Company") as a result of acting as
 investment adviser to various investment companies registered under Section 8 of
 the Investment Company Act of 1940.
Edward C. Johnson 3d and FMR LLC, through its control of Fidelity,
 and the funds each has sole power to dispose of the 17,809,830 shares owned by
 the Funds.
Members of the family of Edward C. Johnson 3d, Chairman of FMR LLC,
 are the predominant owners, directly or through trusts, of Series B voting
 common shares of FMR LLC, representing 49% of the voting power of FMR LLC.  The
 Johnson family group and all other Series B shareholders have entered into a
 shareholders' voting agreement under which all Series B voting common shares
 will be voted in accordance with the majority vote of Series B voting common
 shares.  Accordingly, through their ownership of voting common shares and the
 execution of the shareholders' voting agreement, members of the Johnson family
 may be deemed, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, to form a controlling
 group with respect to FMR LLC.
Neither FMR LLC nor Edward C. Johnson 3d, Chairman of FMR LLC, has
 the sole power to vote or direct the voting of the shares owned directly by the
 Fidelity Funds, which power resides with the Funds' Boards of Trustees.
 Fidelity carries out the voting of the shares under written guidelines
 established by the Funds' Boards of Trustees.
FIL Limited ("FIL"), Pembroke Hall, 42 Crow Lane, Hamilton,
 Bermuda, and various foreign-based subsidiaries provide investment advisory and
 management services to a number of non-U.S. investment companies and certain
 institutional investors.  FIL, which is a qualified institution under section

Partnerships controlled predominantly by members of the family of
 Edward C. Johnson 3d, Chairman of FMR LLC and FIL, or trusts for their benefit,
 own shares of FIL voting stock with the right to cast approximately 47% of the
 total votes which may be cast by all holders of FIL voting stock.  FMR LLC and
 FIL are separate and independent corporate entities, and their Boards of
 Directors are generally composed of different individuals.
FMR LLC and FIL are of the view that they are not acting as a
 "group" for purposes of Section 13(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 (the "1934" Act) and that they are not otherwise required to attribute to each
 other the "beneficial ownership" of securities "beneficially owned" by the other
 corporation within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act.
 Therefore, they are of the view that the shares held by the other corporation
 need not be aggregated for purposes of Section 13(d). However, FMR LLC is making
 this filing on a voluntary basis as if all of the shares are beneficially owned
 by FMR LLC and FIL on a joint basis.
FIL has sole dispositive power over 24,043,972 shares owned by the
 International Funds. FIL has sole power to vote or direct the voting of
 21,983,672 shares and no power to vote or direct the voting of 2,060,300 shares

 RYANAIR CONDEMNS COMPETITION APPEAL TRIBUNAL DECISION TO DELAY THE BREAK UP OF
 THE BAA AIRPORT MONOPOLY
Ryanair, the UK's favourite airline, today (25th Feb 10) condemned the decision
 by the Competition Appeal Tribunal to overturn the universally acclaimed
 decision by the Competition Commission to force the break-up of the BAA airport
 monopoly by requiring the BAA to sell Gatwick, Stansted and one of its Scottish
 airports.
Today's decision, which was based on a finding that there might have been an
 appearance of bias in relation to one of the six members of the Commission,
 because of his advisory role to the pension fund of the employees of
 shareholders of Manchester Airport Group plc, is in Ryanair's view damaging to
 competition, damaging for consumers and damaging to British tourism.As a result
 of this decision, the sale of Stansted and one of the BAA's Scottish airports
 will now be delayed for a minimum period of two years, with the result that
 traffic at Stansted Airport will continue to decline, as consumers suffer
 squalid and inefficient terminal facilities and continue to be victimised by the
 BAA monopoly's high charges.
Ryanair believes that a sensible and practical outcome to any finding of an
Ryanair Holdings PLC Condemns Competition Appeal Tribunal Decision
 appearance of bias in this case would be for Manchester Airport Group plc to be
 prohibited from bidding for Stansted and/or one of the BAA's Scottish airports
 when disposed, but to delay the introduction of competition, lower prices and
 better services at Stansted by a period of at least two years, on this legal
 technicality is unfair on the travelling public.  The original decision to
 break-up the BAA airport monopoly was universally welcomed by airport users,
 airlines and national newspaper editorials all over the UK.  More importantly,
 none of the substantive findings of that decision was challenged by the BAA.
The sale of Gatwick Airport has already resulted in Gatwick now introducing some
 limited element of competition to Heathrow and Stansted.  The new owners of
 Gatwick are improving facilities and lowering charges in order to attract new
 routes and new traffic to the South East of London.  However the BAA monopoly
 continues to control (with high prices and inefficient facilities) the airport
 access at Heathrow and Stansted.  Ryanair trusts that its appeal of the
 Tribunal's ruling will be successful, leading to the break-up of the high cost,
 inefficient BAA monopoly which has done so much damage to UK airports, air
 traffic and tourism in recent years.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"The original Competition Commission decision to order the break-up of the BAA
 airport monopoly was welcomed by the entire airline industry, passengers and the
 national media.  Today's decision, which appears to be based on a legal
 technicality (or irrelevancy), will now delay the much needed introduction of
 competition and consumer choice at Stansted by at least two years.  We regret
 that passengers at Stansted will pay higher charges and suffer inferior
 facilities for at least two more years as a result of this regrettable
 Competition Appeal Tribunal decision.
"As traffic continues to decline at Stansted, and airlines and passengers
 continue to suffer high charges and badly run facilities, we again call on the
 BAA monopoly to sell Stansted Airport in order to introduce much needed
 competition in the London airport market, or alternatively for the  Court of
 Appeal to overturn the Tribunal's ruling and  bring forward the break-up of the
 high cost, inefficient and anti-consumer BAA airport monopoly in the interests
 of competition and a better deal for British consumers, passengers and tourism."

easyJet Annual General Meeting  2010 Chairman's Statement
Speaking at the Company's Annual General Meeting in Luton today, Sir Michael
 Rake, Chairman of easyJet plc, said:
"This is my first AGM as Chairman of easyJet and I am delighted to be taking
 over the Chairmanship of a company which has achieved so much since it started
 fourteen years ago.
easyJet has continued to be  one of the best performing European airlines even
 during the recession. It was one of the few airlines globally to make a profit
 last year with an underlying pre tax profit of GBP43.7 million. easyJet also
 delivered the best revenue performance of any European airline, driven by strong
 consumer demand because we offer the lowest fares to the most convenient
 airports.
In a tough environment, easyJet's continued superior performance is a testament
 to the quality of our business model: Europe's premier air transport network,
 strong customer proposition and service delivery linked to a highly efficient
easyJet PLC AGM Statement
 operating model that is predicated on simplicity and low cost.
At easyJet our people really do make the difference to the customer experience.
 We have outstanding people, including our front line cabin crew and pilots who
 are highly trained and professional. They all make a crucial contribution to our
 success by creating an easyJet personality which is an important competitive
 advantage. I would like to thank them all for helping to deliver such a
 resilient performance in very difficult economic circumstances.
Importantly, in the past year we have strengthened the fundamentals of the
 business. With improvements in network quality, enhancements to easyJet.com and
 a clear programme to take GBP190million of cost per annum out of the business
 which we expect to deliver after inflation a net GBP1 cost reduction per seat by
 end of September 2012. All of this will give easyJet a great platform for
 profitable growth in the medium term and to achieve our 15% return on equity
 target. The Board has also agreed a fleet plan of around 7.5% growth per annum
 in seats flown over the next five years. This fleet plan will enable easyJet to
 grow its share of the European short-haul market from around today's 7% to 10%.
 Whilst we have not recommended payment of a dividend for the year ended 30
 September 2009 the Board will keep the issue of returns to shareholders under
 review as we achieve our financial targets.
Contrary to the suggestions contained in the  inappropriate, inaccurate and
 personal attacks launched by  Ryanair on Stelios our founder, we believe that
 ensuring our customers arrive at their destinations on time is one of the  key
 factors in the  delivery of a winning customer proposition. This is why we
 continually measure on-time performance, and we  are pleased that in the  year
 the number of flights arriving  'on time' improved from 75.4% to  79.5%.  These
 statistics were clearly presented on our website as part of our annual report on
 20 January 2010.
Much of our future potential has its foundations in the work done by Andy
 Harrison and his team. Andy leaves later in the year to take up new challenges
 and we are making good progress with the recruitment of a chief executive to be
 his successor. I am pleased that Chris Kennedy will be joining the easyJet Board
 in June as Group Finance Director; he brings a strong combination of financial,
 business and leadership capabilities and I am sure that Chris will make an
 important contribution to easyJet.
I would like to thank Sir David Michels who took on the role of interim Chairman
 in July 2009; I'm delighted that given his wealth of experience he remains with
 the Company as its Deputy Chairman. I am looking forward to working with David
 and the rest of the Board and the easyJet senior management team to continue to
 develop the business.
The legal action with easyGroup over the interpretation of the brand licence
easyJet PLC AGM Statement
 agreement continues. As we have previously disclosed, following High Court
 directions in summer 2009, some elements of the easyGroup claim have been recast
 within notices alleging breach of contract. These include notices alleging
 non-compliance with some administrative obligations by easyJet, such as auditing
 sublicensees and monitoring compliance with the 75:25 Rule. Naturally, easyJet
 remains in correspondence with easyGroup on these points. However, the principal
 subject matters at issue remain the interpretation of "the 75:25 Rule" and the
 classification of certain revenue streams affecting that interpretation.
Obviously, the Litigation Committee of the Board is committed to ensuring the
 optimal outcome for the Company. Whilst we will be receptive to opportunities
 for an acceptable commercial settlement, we are preparing for a court hearing
 (scheduled for June 2010) which we hope will provide clarity on the issues in
 dispute. To this end we remain reassured by robust advice from our professional
 advisers that the Company's interpretation of the brand licence is well-founded.
The aviation industry plays a central role in global wealth creation and in the
 UK alone it contributes GBP11billion to GDP. Aviation contributes just three
 percent of global manmade greenhouse gas emissions but we know it is important
 that our industry addresses its wider responsibilities, in particular to ensure
 that we play our part in tackling climate change. However if this is done
 through purely constraining demand the economic and social benefits of travel
 will be put at risk. It is therefore critical that the right policy framework is
 put in place to deliver sustainable aviation with efficiency gains and lower
 emissions. This means pressuring airlines to use existing aircraft technology
 more efficiently and pressurising airframe and engine manufacturers to bring
 forward the next generation of technology with more urgency. We also need to
 ensure that air travel taxes are not blunt, ineffective taxes on passengers such
 as APD in the UK, but emissions based taxes which are designed encourage
 airlines to operate more efficiently.
We have now taken the first steps towards aviation entering into the European
 Emissions Trading System or ETS. This will put a price on aviation CO2 emissions
 to encourage greater airline efficiency. However we cannot simply rely on the
 carbon price mechanism to deliver the necessary efficiency gains. Additional
 measures are needed to force the pace of technical development. Specifically
 governments should set minimum standards for aircraft emissions in the same way
 as they do in other industries. Aircraft which did not meet these standards
 should not be permitted to fly; different standards and different emission
 milestones would be required for each class of aircraft. This approach provides
 a global solution for a global industry.
Finally as we commented in our Interim Management Statement released on 21
 January:
"easyJet's pre tax result in 2010 at current fuel prices and exchange rates1 is
easyJet PLC AGM Statement
 expected to benefit by around GBP60million in the first half of the year and
 GBP100million for the full year from the positive contribution of lower dollar
 fuel prices as higher price fuel hedges roll off and a stronger euro, partially
 offset by the negative impact of a strengthening US dollar.
Yield performance and any future levels of weather related disruption are the
 key variables in determining easyJet's first half performance and consequently
 the first half pre tax result is expected to be a loss in the range of
 GBP80million to GBP95million delivering a significant improvement compared to
 the first half of the prior financial year.
Economic conditions remain challenging and we continue to expect a tough trading
 environment. However, the underlying performance of the business in the first
 quarter has been encouraging and easyJet remains on track to deliver substantial
 profit improvement during 2010."

 Ryanair Holdings PLC
 10 February 2010
 Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, today (10th Feb 10) announced that it
 will build a second maintenance hangar at Glasgow Prestwick Airport at a cost of
 GBP8m which will create 200 new engineering jobs, increasing the total jobs
 sustained by Ryanair in Ayrshire to over 2,400.  The facility, which is due to
 open in October 2010, was announced in Prestwick by Scotland's First Minister,
 Alex Salmond and Ryanair's Michael O'Leary.
 The Scottish Government, Scottish Enterprise and Prestwick Airport secured this
 6,000 sq/m hangar investment despite intense competition from five other Ryanair
 bases throughout Europe.  They were also instrumental in securing Ryanair's
 existing 4,000 sq/m hangar which opened in 2004.
 By securing this new investment the Scottish Government has helped to create
 over 400 engineering and support jobs between the two hangars, which will
 maintain a large portion of Ryanair's 210 aircraft fleet.  Ryanair's 29 routes
 from its Prestwick base deliver 2m passengers p.a. which sustain 2,000 local
 jobs, including those of over 300 Ryanair cabin crew and pilots.
 Wrapping up a great day for Scotland, Ryanair also announced three new routes
 from Edinburgh to Faro, Marrakesh and Paris from May 2010 as well as increased
 frequencies on 16 other routes from Edinburgh and Glasgow Prestwick this summer.
 In total Ryanair expects to carry over 4m passengers to/from Scotland over the
 next 12 months, making Ryanair Scotland's favourite airline.
 Speaking at Glasgow Prestwick, Michael O'Leary said:
 "Ryanair wishes to thank First Minister Salmond, the Scottish Government,
 Scottish Enterprise and Prestwick Airport for their help and support in winning
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Second 8M Prestwick Hangar
 this new hangar and these 200 new jobs for Ayrshire and Scotland despite intense
 competition from five other European airports.  Ryanair's new(second)
 maintenance hangar at Glasgow Prestwick Airport, will create 200 new engineering
 jobs, in addition to the 2,200 local jobs which have already been created and
 sustained in Ayrshire as a direct result of Ryanair's base and our existing
 hangar facility at Glasgow Prestwick.
 "Ryanair's successful growth in Scotland is possible thanks to our on-going
 partnership with the Scottish Government and Scottish Enterprise, who have
 repeatedly supported our vision for many more low fare flights to/from
 Scotland."
 Welcoming the new investment and jobs First Minister Alex Salmond said:
"I am delighted that Ryanair is strengthening its operations in Scotland and
 this announcement demonstrates that Ayrshire has the quality infrastructure and
 skilled workforce to secure this major project, having fought-off competition
 from a number of European locations.
"The Scottish Government is investing GBP1.5 million in this GBP8 million
 project, which shows Ryanair's commitment to Ayrshire and builds on Prestwick's
 reputation as a centre for European excellence in maintenance, repair and
 overhaul projects.
"Ryanair makes a substantial contribution to Scotland's economy through its
 engineering facilities and encouraging tourism and business traffic via its
 Glasgow Prestwick, Aberdeen and Edinburgh flights".

 Ryanair Holdings PLC
 02 February 2010
 Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, today (2nd Feb 10) announced that it
 will open seven new summer sun routes, and temporarily base one additional
 aircraft at Cork for the 3 peak months of June, July and August, to offer Cork
 consumers competition, choice and much lower summer sun fares than Aer Lingus.
Ryanair's seven summer sun routes from Cork to Alicante, Barcelona (Reus),
 Bordeaux, Faro, La Rochelle, Lanzarote and Malaga will deliver an additional
 40,000 passengers through Cork airport in just three months.  However, Ryanair
 highlighted that year round growth at Cork is not possible due to the Irish
 Govt's EUR10 tourist tax and the high, and rising, charges imposed by the DAA
 Monopoly at Cork airport.
Ryanair's new routes will allow many families in Munster to travel to the sun at
 low fares from Cork Airport and make up for much of the flights lost as a result
 of Budget Travel's recent closure.
Ryanair celebrated these seven summer peak routes by slashing 30% off its
 current fares for travel in late February and March which are available for
 booking for 3 days only on www.ryanair.com.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC 7 Summer Sun Routes at Cork
"Ryanair's seven summer peak routes will mean that for the first time the people
 of Cork can escape to the sun by availing of Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares,
 avoiding Aer Lingus' high fares.
"To celebrate these new summer peak routes Ryanair is slashing 30% of all fares
 which are now available for travel across Europe in late February and March.
 Since seats at these crazy low prices will be snapped up quickly, we urge
 passengers to book them immediately on www.ryanair.com ".

 ·       Principal risks and uncertainties relating to the remaining three months
 of the year;
 ·       Related party transactions; and
 ·       Post balance sheet events.
Results of operations for the nine month period ended December 31, 2009 compared
 to the nine month period ended December 31, 2008, including important events
 that occurred during the nine months, are set forth in the Operating and
 Financial review on pages 10-14.
Reconciliation of results for the period under IFRS to adjusted results for the
 nine month period and quarter ended December 31, 2009
The unaudited condensed consolidated interim income statements for the nine
 month period and quarter ended December 31, 2009, as set forth on pages 5 and 6
 of this nine month financial report, presents the results for the periods
 separately between pre-exceptional and exceptional items. Certain items are
 presented separately, as exceptional items, which, by virtue of their size or
 incidence, are unusual in the context of the Groups's ongoing core operations,
 as we believe this presentation represents the underlying business more
 accurately and reflects the manner in which investors typically analyse the
 results.

 governments and their respective regulatory agencies, fluctuations in currency
 exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour relations,
 the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic
 environment in Ireland, the UK, and Continental Europe, the general willingness

 March 31, 2009 are available at www.ryanair.com.
 The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2009 do not
 constitute statutory financial statements of the Group within the meaning of
 Regulation 40 of the European Communities (Companies, Group Accounts)
 Regulations, 1992. Statutory financial statements for the year ended March 31,
 2009 have been filed with the Companies' Office. The auditors' report on those
 financial statements was unqualified.
In addition to the presentation of the condensed consolidated interim financial
 statements for the nine month period ended December 31, 2009, the condensed
 consolidated income statement and condensed consolidated statement of
 comprehensive income for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 have also been
 provided on a supplementary basis and have been prepared in accordance with the
 measurement and recognition principles of IFRS as adopted by the EU.  The
 quarterly financial information does not include all information required for
 interim financial reporting under IAS 34.
 The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors,
 approved the interim financial statements for the nine months ended December 31,
 2009 on January 29, 2010.
Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been
 prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most
 recent published consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in
 accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and in compliance with IFRSs as issued
 by the International Accounting Standards Board.
The following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the
 first time for the financial year beginning 1 April 2009.
*  IFRS 8 - Operating Segments ("IFRS 8"). We adopted IFRS 8 which replaces IAS 14
 - Segmental Reporting ("IAS 14"), during the nine months ended 31 December 2009.
 IFRS 8 requires a "management approach" under which segment information is
 presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes. IAS 14
 required identification of two sets of segments - one based on business units
Ryanair Holdings PLC Third Quarter Results -14-
 and the other on geographical areas. IFRS 8 requires additional disclosures
 around identifying segments and their products and services. Our operations are
 organised as a single business unit, that of the provision of low-fares
 airline-related activities, including scheduled services, car hire, internet
 income and related sales to third parties. There has been no change to the
 operating segment as a result of the adoption of IFRS 8 and the reportable
 segment is consistent with that previously reported under the primary business
 segment format of the segment reporting under IAS 14. The additional disclosures
 around identifying segments and their products and services will be disclosed in
 the 2010 annual financial statements.  Comparative segment information has been
 represented, where necessary, in conformity with the transitional requirements
 of IFRS 8. Since the change in accounting policy only impacts the presentation
 and disclosure aspects, there is no impact on reported results or earnings per
 share.
*  IAS 1 (revised) - Presentation of Financial Statements. The revised standard
 prohibits the presentation of items of income and expenses (that is "non owner
 changes in equity") in the statement of changes in equity, requiring "non owner
 changes in equity" to be presented separately from owner changes in equity. All
 "non owner changes in equity" are required to be shown in a performance
 statement. Entities can choose whether to present one performance statement (the
 statement of comprehensive income) or two statements (the income statement and
 the statement of comprehensive income). We have elected to present two
 statements: an income statement and a statement of comprehensive income. Also,

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Operating and Financial Overview
Introduction
For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") all figures
 and comments are by reference to the adjusted income statement excluding the
 exceptional items referred to below. A reconciliation of the results for the
 period under IFRS to the adjusted results is provided on page 15.
Exceptional items in the nine month period ended December 31, 2009 amounted to
 EUR13.5m reflecting an impairment of the Aer Lingus shareholding recorded in the
 quarter to June 30, 2009. Exceptional items in the nine month period ended
 December 31, 2008 amounted to EUR136.5m consisting of an impairment of the Aer
 Lingus shareholding of EUR93.6m and an accelerated depreciation charge of EUR42.9m
 on aircraft disposed in financial years 2009 and 2010.
Adjusted profit after tax excluding exceptional items increased by EUR263.0m to
 EUR376.1m. Including exceptional items the profit after tax for the nine months
 amounted to EUR362.6m compared to a loss of EUR23.4m in the nine month period ended
 December 31, 2008.
 Summary nine months ended December 31, 2009
Adjusted profit after tax increased by EUR263.0m to EUR376.1m compared to EUR113.1m in
 the nine month period ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to a 40% decrease in
 fuel costs, partially offset by a 16% decline in average fares. Total operating
 revenues decreased by 2% to EUR2,378.7m as average fares fell by 16% due to the
 recession, price promotions, and the adverse impact of the movement in
Ryanair Holdings PLC Third Quarter Results -12-
 euro/sterling exchange rates. Ancillary revenues grew by 7% to EUR485.7m, lower
 than the increase in passenger volumes, due to a decline in average spend per
 passenger primarily due to lower excess baggage revenues, and the negative
 impact of the movement in euro/sterling exchange rates. Total revenue per
 passenger as a result decreased by 14%, whilst the Load Factor remained flat at
 84% during the period.
Total operating expenses fell by 15% to EUR1,924.7m, primarily due to lower fuel
 prices, offset by the higher level of activity and increased operating costs
 associated with the growth of the airline. Fuel, which represents 35% of total
 operating costs compared to 49% in the comparative period, decreased by 40% to
 EUR666.4m due to the fall in the price per gallon paid offset by an increase in
 the number of hours flown. Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 5% and including
 fuel they fell by 26%. Operating margin increased by 13 points to 19% whilst
 operating profit increased by EUR309.5m to EUR454.0m.
 Net margins increased to 16% from 5% at December 31, 2008 for the reasons
 outlined above.
 Adjusted earnings per share for the period were 25.48 cent compared to 7.65 cent
 in the previous nine month period ended December 31, 2008.
 Balance sheet
 Total cash and cash equivalents remained strong at EUR2,439.7m.
 The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR409.2m and a further
 EUR93.3m delivery proceeds on the sale of four Boeing 737-800 aircraft (and two
 spare engines) which partially funded capital expenditure incurred during the
 period. Capital expenditure of EUR593.5m largely consisted of advance aircraft
 payments for future aircraft deliveries and the delivery of 32 new Boeing
 737-800 aircraft in the period. Total debt, net of repayments, increased by
 EUR242.1m to EUR2,640.5m during the period. Net debt at period end was EUR200.8m.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis nine month period ended December 31, 2009
Adjusted profit after tax, increased by EUR263.0m to EUR376.1m primarily due to
 lower fuel costs, partially offset by a 16% decline in average fares. Total
 operating revenues decreased by 2% to EUR2,378.7m as average fares fell by 16% due
 to the recession, price promotions, the adverse impact of the movement in
 euro/sterling exchange rates and a decline in ancillary revenues per passenger,
 offset by a 15% increase in passenger numbers. Fuel, which represents 35% of
 total operating costs compared to 49% in the prior period comparative, decreased
 by 40% to EUR666.4m due to the fall in the price per gallon paid offset by an
 increase in the number of hours flown. Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 5% and
 including fuel they fell by 26%.  Operating margin, as a result, increased by 13
 points to 19%, whilst operating profit increased by EUR309.5m to EUR454.0m.

Exceptional items
 The Company presents certain items separately, which are unusual, by virtue of
 their size and incidence, in the context of our ongoing core operations, as we
 believe this presentation represents the underlying business more accurately and
 reflects the manner in which investors typically analyse the results. In the
 current and prior period comparative we have presented an impairment of a
 financial asset investment and also accelerated depreciation related to aircraft
 disposals separately because of the unusual nature of these items. Any amounts
 deemed "exceptional" for management discussion and analysis purposes have been
 classified for the purposes of the income statement in the same way as non
 exceptional amounts of the same nature.
2.  Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements,
 estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual
 results may differ from these estimates.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements
 made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key
 sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the
 most recent published consolidated financial statements.
3.  Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to
 quarter, and management expects these variations to continue. Among the factors
 causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to general
 economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Accordingly the first
 half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.

4.  Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the
 nine months ended December 31, 2009 was 10.5% (2008: 0.0%). The tax charge for
 the nine months ended December 31, 2009 of EUR44.3m (2008: EUR0.0m) primarily
 comprises a deferred tax charge relating to the utilisation of previous trading
 losses.
5.  Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most
 recent published consolidated financial statements.  The charge to the income
 statement in the nine months of approximately EUR3.7m (2008: EUR2.5m) is related to
 the fair value of various share options granted in prior periods, which are
 being recognised within the income statement in accordance with employee
 services rendered.
6.  Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its
 business.  The Group does not believe that any such litigation will individually
 or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
 Group. Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, management
 believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not
 expected to materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or
 financial position.
7.  Capital commitments
 At December 31, 2009 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 210 (2008: 167) Boeing
 737-800 aircraft. It also had firm orders for an additional 112 Boeing
 737-800's.  This includes 10 options exercised by the Group in December 2009.
 The delivery of these firm order aircraft will increase the fleet size (net of
 planned disposals) to 299 aircraft by March 31, 2013.
8.  Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR93.2m at March 31,
 2009 to EUR101.9m at December 31, 2009 is comprised of an impairment charge of
 EUR13.5m on its shareholding in Aer Lingus, recognised in the income statement,
 reflecting a further decline in the Aer Lingus share price from EUR0.59 per share
 at March 31, 2009 to EUR0.50 at June 30, 2009. This impairment charge is offset by
 a gain of EUR22.2m, recognised through reserves, reflecting the subsequent
 increase in the share price to EUR0.64 per share at December 31, 2009. All such
 impairment losses are required to be recognised in the income statement and are
 not subsequently reversed, while gains are recognised through reserves.
9.  Analysis of operating segment
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares
 airline-related activities, including scheduled services, car hire, internet
 income and related sales to third parties. The Company operates a single fleet
 of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 As of April 1, 2009 the Company determines and presents operating segments based
Ryanair Holdings PLC Third Quarter Results -15-
 on the information that internally is provided to the CEO, who is the Company's
 Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). When making resource allocation decisions
 the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation
 decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the
 entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in type. The objective in making
 resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial results,
 rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated
 adjusted profit/(loss) after tax of the Company for the period. This measure
 excludes the effects of certain income and expense items, which are unusual, by
 virtue of their size and incidence, in the context of the Company's ongoing core
 operations, such as the impairment of a financial asset investment and
 accelerated depreciation related to aircraft disposals (see reconciliation on
 page 15).
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company
 has a single reportable segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which
 is flexibly employed across the Company's integrated route network and is
 directly attributable to its reportable segment operations. In addition, as the
 Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and liabilities
 have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
 There have been no changes to the basis of segmentation or the measurement basis
 for the segment profit or loss since March 31, 2009.

 Total operating revenues decreased by 2% to EUR2,378.7m, as a 16% decline in
 average fares was offset by a 15% increase in passenger traffic to 52.4m.
Total revenue per passenger decreased by 14% due to a 7% decline in ancillary
 revenues per passenger and a 16% fall in average fares.
Scheduled passenger revenues decreased by 3% to EUR1,893.0m due to a 15% rise in
 passenger volumes on existing routes offset by a 16% decrease in average fares,
 due to the recession, price promotions, lower baggage penetration rates, and the
 adverse impact of the movement in euro/sterling exchange rates. Load factor
 remained flat at 84%, compared to the period ended December 31, 2008.
Ancillary revenues increased by 7% to EUR485.7m, slower than the 15% increase in
 passenger volume, due to a decline in average spend per passenger primarily due
 to lower excess baggage revenues, and the adverse impact of the movement in
 euro/sterling exchange rates.
Total operating expenses decreased by 15% to EUR1,924.7m primarily due to the 40%
 decrease in fuel costs and 5% unit cost reductions (ex fuel) delivered in the
 period offset somewhat by the higher level of activity and costs associated with
 the growth of the airline.
Staff costs increased by 7% to EUR250.8m. This reflects an 11% increase in average
 headcount to 7,071, offset by the impact of a company wide pay freeze, the
 higher portion of contract crew operating during the period, and the rise in
Ryanair Holdings PLC Third Quarter Results -13-
 cabin crew numbers during the period who earn lower than the average salary.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 15% to EUR169.0m. This reflects, net of
 disposals, an additional 31 lower cost 'owned aircraft in the fleet this period
 compared to the period ended December 31, 2008.
Fuel costs decreased by 40% to EUR666.4m primarily due to the lower cost of fuel
 in the period.
Maintenance costs increased by 21% to EUR60.2m due to an increase in the number of
 leased aircraft from 39 to 49 and additional costs arising from increased line
 maintenance activity at new bases.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 21% to EUR69.6m, which is lower than the 26%
 increase in the average number of leased aircraft from 39 to 49, reflecting the
 positive impact of lower lease rentals achieved.
Route charges rose by 16% to EUR253.2m due to an increase in the number of sectors
 flown and an increase in average unit rates, offset by the positive impact of
 euro/sterling exchange rates.
 Airport & handling charges increased by 4% to EUR357.2m due to a 15% increase in
 passenger volumes, offset by lower costs at new airports and bases launched and
 savings achieved on handling costs.
Marketing, distribution and other expenses decreased by 4% to EUR98.3m, due to
 improved margins on some existing products, indirect cost reductions, and the
 increased focus on internet based promotions.
Operating margin increased by 13 points to 19% due to the reasons outlined above
 and operating profits have increased by EUR309.5m to EUR454.0m compared to the
 period ended December 31, 2008.
Finance income decreased by 72% to EUR17.9m primarily due to the impact of lower
 deposit interest rates and the prudent placement of funds with highly rated and
 guaranteed financial institutions which typically provide a lower yield.
Finance expense decreased by 43% to EUR53.0m primarilydue to the impact of lower
 interest rates offset by the drawdown of debt to part finance the purchase of
 new aircraft.
Foreign exchange losses during the period of EUR1.1m are primarily due to the
 impact of movement in the sterling rate against the euro.
Balance sheet
 Total cash and cash equivalents remained strong at EUR2,439.7m. The Group
 generated cash from operating activities of EUR409.2m and a further EUR93.3m
 delivery proceeds on the sale of four Boeing 737-800 aircraft (and two spare
 engines) which partially funded capital expenditure incurred during the period.
 Capital expenditure amounted to EUR593.5m and largely consisted of advance
Ryanair Holdings PLC Third Quarter Results -13-
 aircraft payments for future aircraft deliveries and the delivery of 32 new
 Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Total debt, net of repayments, increased by EUR242.1m
 during the period to EUR2,640.5m. Net debt at period end was EUR200.8m
Shareholders Equity at December 31, 2009 increased by EUR370.7m to EUR2,795.8m
 compared to March 31, 2009 due to the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for
 derivative financial assets, stock option grants, profit of EUR362.6m in the
 period and the issue of new shares of EUR10.4m (as detailed on page 9).
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Quarter ended December 31, 2009
There were no exceptional items in the quarter ended December 31, 2009.
 Exceptional items in the quarter ended December 31, 2008 amounted to EUR17.3m
 consisting of an accelerated depreciation charge on aircraft disposed in
 financial years 2009 and 2010.
Adjusted loss after tax, decreased by EUR90.6m to EUR10.9m primarily due to lower
 fuel costs, partially offset by a 12% decline in average fares. Total operating
 revenues increased by 1% to EUR611.9m as average fares fell by 12% due to the
 recession, price promotions, the adverse impact of the movement in euro/sterling
 exchange rates and a decline in ancillary revenues per passenger, offset by a
 14% increase in passenger numbers. Fuel, which represents 34% of total operating
 costs compared to 47% in the prior period comparative, decreased by 37% to
 EUR206.6m due to the fall in the price per gallon paid offset by an increase in
 the number of hours flown. Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 4%, despite a 3%
 increase in average sector length, and including fuel they fell by 23%.
 Operating margin, as a result, was marginally above breakeven, (an improvement
 of 15 points), whilst operating profit increased by EUR93.3m to EUR1.4m.
Total operating revenues increased by 1% to EUR611.9m, as a 14% increase in
 passenger traffic to 16.0m was offset by a 12% decline in average fares.
Total revenue per passenger decreased by 11% due to a 12% fall in average fares
 and a slower growth of ancillary revenues.
Scheduled passenger revenues remained flat at EUR472.5m due to a 14% rise in
 passenger volumes, offset by a 12% decline in average fares, due to the
 recession, price promotions, and the adverse impact of the movement in
 euro/sterling exchange rates. Load factor increased by 1% to 82% compared to the
 period ended December 31, 2008.
Ancillary revenues increased by 6% to EUR139.4m, slower than the 14% rise in
 passenger volumes due to a decline in average spend per passenger primarily due
 to lower excess baggage revenues, and the adverse impact of the movement in
 euro/sterling exchange rates.
Total operating expenses decreased by 12% to EUR610.5m primarily due to the 37%
 decrease in fuel prices and 4% unit cost reductions (ex fuel) delivered in the

 period offset somewhat by the higher level of activity and costs associated with
 the growth of the airline.
Staff costs increased by 10% to EUR82.2m. This reflects a 13% increase in average

 higher level of contract crew operating during the period, and the rise in cabin
 crew numbers who earn lower than the average salary.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 14% to EUR57.7m. This reflects, net of

 quarter compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2008.
Fuel costs decreased by 37% to EUR206.6m primarily due to the lower cost of fuel
 in the period.
Maintenance costs increased by 5% to EUR19.9m due to an increase in the average
 number of leased aircraft from 40 to 52 and additional costs arising from
 increased line maintenance activity at new bases, offset by a rise in warranty
 credits received.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 27% to EUR24.6m, due to an increase in the
 average number of leased aircraft from 40 to 52 offset by the positive impact of

 RYANAIR WELCOMES EC FINDING OF NO STATE AID
 IN THE BRATISLAVA INVESTIGATION
Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (27 Jan '10) welcomed the European
 Commission's confirmation that Ryanair's agreement with Bratislava airport does
 not involve any State aid. This decision marks another successful conclusion of
 a State aid investigation involving Ryanair, in addition to the Charleroi
 judgment in December 2008.
Following a detailed investigation resulting from a baseless complaint by Sky
 Europe, the Commission was able to conclude that Ryanair's agreement with
 Bratislava airport fully complies with the Market Economy Investor Principle.
 The Commission therefore confirmed that a private airport would have agreed to
 the same terms of the agreement with Ryanair, with the view to growing traffic
 and commercial revenues at the airport.
Ryanair's Juliusz Komorek said:
"The Commission's confirmation that Ryanair's agreement with Bratislava airport
 does not involve any State aid is good news for consumers and regional and
 secondary airports throughout Europe. It is also a welcome development in the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Welcomes EC Ruling of No State Aid in Bratislava
 Commission's application of State aid rules. The decision confirms that public
 airports are permitted to offer the same deals to airlines as their private
 counterparts do, with the view to attracting traffic and maximising commercial
 revenues.  It further reflects and affirms the commercial realities of the
 airline and airport markets following the liberalisation in the 1990s.
"Ryanair calls on the Commission to close the remaining seven State aid
 investigations at Alghero, Pau, Lübeck, Frankfurt Hahn, Berlin Schönefeld,
 Aarhus and Tampere, and confirm that Ryanair's agreements with these airports
 are arms-length commercial deals which do not involve State aid. This would
 remove the damaging uncertainty from the market, which was initially created by
 spurious complaints by high-fare, fuel-surcharging airlines and their fellow
 monopoly-abusing, consumer-overcharging airports".

Ryanair celebrates another victory for German consumers
Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, today (22nd Jan 10) celebrated a further
 victory for consumers after the Higher Regional Court of Hamburg ruled that
 'screenscraping' to resell Ryanair's flights is unlawful and banned a German
 website Vtours from screenscraping Ryanair's website.
Today's ruling against Vtours cements the decision handed down in Hamburg last
 May, which ruled that the scraping of Ryanair.com to resell Ryanair tickets is
 unlawful.  Vtours is now permanently banned from reselling Ryanair flights to
 consumers.
Ryanair has taken several high profile cases against screenscrapers throughout
 Europe as part of its long running campaign to try to stop their anti-consumer
 practices.  These online resellers access Ryanair's website in breach of its
 Terms of Use, take its flight information and sell Ryanair tickets to consumers,
 with high additional charges, which are not made clear to the consumer.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
"Ryanair celebrates todays victory for German consumers as it once again
Ryanair Holdings PLC Another Victory for German Consumers
 confirms that European courts support Ryanairs fight to protect consumers
 against overcharging screenscraping ticket-touts. Ryanair will continue its
 fight against screenscrapers in the interests of passengers until this practice
 of misleading consumers has been outlawed across Europe. Todays result is a
 milestone achievement in that fight.
"All price comparison websites can
 enter into a licence agreement with Ryanair to allow them to legally provide
 consumers with genuine price comparisons and guarantee that passengers are not
 subjected to additional charges. If Vtours is interested in genuinely providing
 an honest comparison  for consumers in Germany it is welcome to sign up to this
 licence".

RYANAIR CONFIRMS 20% CUT IN DUBLIN SUMMER 2010 TRAFFIC
 AS DAA 40% COST INCREASE AND EUR10 TAX DEVASTATE TOURISM
Ryanair, Dublin Airport's largest airline, today (21 Jan 10) confirmed that it
 will further reduce its flights and traffic at Dublin Airport this summer by up
 to 20% as high and rising DAA airport charges and the Govt's EUR10 tourist tax
 continue to devastate Irish traffic and tourism. These cuts come one week after
 BMI announced the closure of its Dublin base and cuts in its Dublin-Heathrow
 flights from 7 to 4 this summer.
The DAA's high costs, and the Govt's EUR10 tourist tax have caused Dublin
 Airport's traffic to collapse by 3m passengers in 2009 (during a year when
 Ryanair grew elsewhere by 8m passengers). Already this winter, Dublin Airport
 has suffered the loss of British Airways, Malev and Budget Travel in addition to
 BMI's Heathrow cutbacks.
Ryanair regrets the Govt's response to this tourism collapse which was to order
 the Aviation Regulator to approve up to 40% increases in the DAA's already high
 fees from 2010 onwards, to help the near bankrupt DAA pay for its unneeded and
 over specified EUR1.2bn T2, which has cost 6 times more than the EUR200m originally
Ryanair Holdings PLC 20% Cut at Dublin due to DAA Costs and Tourist Tax
 promised by the DAA.
Ryanair expects total traffic at Dublin Airport to fall from 20m to 18m in 2010,
 as it announced up to 20% cuts in its Dublin operations for summer 2010
 including:
*  A 17% cut in Dublin based summer fleet (from 18 in 2009 to 15 aircraft in 2010).
 *  A 19% cut in weekly rotations (from over 600 to less than 500).
 *  A 20% cut in Ryanair's Dublin traffic from 8.7m to approx 6.5m in the year to
 March 2011.
 *  The loss of 150 Ryr jobs (pilots, crew & engineers) and over 2,000 support jobs
 at Dublin.
 *  Further cuts in Ryanair's Dublin winter schedule will be announced later.
Ireland in general, and Dublin Airport in particular, are now high cost
 destinations, compared to other European cities where airports are lowering
 costs and Govt's are scrapping tourist taxes. Ryanair's operations at
 Dublin airport will focus on higher yield, outbound, peak month, summer sun
 routes, rather than stimulating year round inbound tourism with low access
 fares.Ryanair today announced a range of extra holiday flights from Dublin for
 the 3 peak summer months of June, July and August 2010 to Alicante, Canary
 Islands, Faro and Malaga (amongst others - see table below) for Irish people who
 simply want to get away for a sun holiday. These additional peak summer flights
 will take up much of the summer sun capacity lost as a result of the recent
 closure of Budget Travel and other tour operators, whose business at Dublin has
 collapsed under the DAA's high fees.
Ryanair will grow by over 7m passengers to 73m this year but all this expansion
 is taking place at EU airports and countries where Govts are reducing airports
 costs (in some cases to zero) and are scrapping tourist taxes. Ryanair will open
 new bases in 2010 in Bari, Brindisi, Faro, Malaga, Oslo (Rygge) and Leeds
 Bradford to support its continued growth.
Announcing these summer 2010 Dublin 20% cuts, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"The DAA's high costs and the Govt's EUR10 tourist tax have already cost Ireland
 more than 3m passengers in 2009.  Today's further cut backs means Ryanair will
 carry 2 million less passengers at Dublin and 1 million fewer passengers at
 Shannon in 2010/11. Irish tourism is now suffering a Govt induced tourism
 collapse under the weight of the EUR10 tourist tax and the extraordinary
 anti-consumer order by the Dept of Transport (to the Aviation Regulator) to
 approve increases in DAA fees of 40% to pay for a Terminal 2 which Dublin's
 airlines neither want nor need.  At a time when Govt's and airports all over
 Europe are scrapping taxes and slashing fees to win Ryanair's traffic growth,
 sadly the Irish Govt is more interested in protecting its high cost DAA monopoly
 at the expense of consumers or of our tourism industry and until this damaging
Ryanair Holdings PLC 20% Cut at Dublin due to DAA Costs and Tourist Tax
 policy is reversed, Dublin Airport and Irish tourism will continue to suffer
 traffic cuts and job losses.
"These events continue to prove Ryanair's case that the Dept of Transport is a
 corrupt and rotten organisation, whose sole policy is to protect the DAA
 monopoly, even at the expense of Irish aviation, tourism and jobs.  The only
 future for T2 is to put it into NAMA. After all, we believe the DAA is bankrupt
 and the building will be empty so let's stick it into NAMA and covert it into
 flats or a conference centre for North County Dublin".

 RYANAIR CALLS ON GOVERNMENT TO SCRAP EUR10 TOURIST TAX AND REVERSE 40% PASSENGER
 FEE INCREASES AT DUBLIN AIRPORT, AS BRITISH MIDLAND (BMI) CLOSE ITS DUBLIN BASE
Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline, today (Jan 12 10) said that the closure of
 British Midland's Dublin base, the loss of 33 jobs, and up to 300,000 passengers
 annually was yet another inevitable result of the Irish Government's EUR10 tourist
 tax and the recent direction by the Dept of Transport to increase Dublin Airport
 charges by 40% from January 2010 onwards.  These Govt price increases have made
 Dublin an expensive and uncompetitive tourist gateway.
Traffic at Dublin Airport fell from 23.5m in 2008 to just 20m in 2009.  As
 Dublin continues to lose airlines, routes and passengers, Ryanair believes that
 traffic at Dublin Airport will fall to just 18m in 2010, as the EUR10 tourist tax
 and the DAA's high and rising charges continue to damage tourism in Ireland.
The traffic crisis at Dublin will get progressively worse in 2010, when the
 Government owned DAA monopoly opens T 2 (allowing the DAA to again increase
 passenger fees), which will increase terminal  capacity at Dublin to over 50m
 passengers annually, at a time when traffic falls to just 18m passengers p.a..
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Calls on Irish Govt to Scrap Tourist Tax
"The Government and the DAA monopoly are entirely responsible for today's
 decision by BMI to cut flights, jobs and traffic at Dublin Airport. More cuts at
 Dublin are inevitable, as Irish traffic and tourism continues to be damaged by
 the Govt's EUR10 tourist tax and the Dept of Transport's recent decision to order
 a 40% increase in Dublin Airport's passenger charges. Irish tourism continues to
 suffer visitor and jobs losses while the Dept of Transport behaves like the
 downtown office of the DAA monopoly.
"This traffic and tourism loss can be reversed, but only when the Irish Govt
 scraps this  failed EUR10 tourist tax and slashes passenger charges at Dublin
 Airport to their 1997 levels. Irish is an island on the periphery of Europe.
 Irish tourism can grow, but only when the Govt returns to a policy of low access
 costs, which means scrapping tourist taxes and slashing the DAA's high charges".

 RYANAIR RESTORES ALL ITALIAN DOMESTIC FLIGHTS, AS AGREEMENT REACHED WITH ENAC
 THAT ALL PASSENGERS WILL PROVIDE PASSPORT OR EU/EEA ID CARDS
Ryanair, Italy's favourite airline, today (7th Jan 10) announced that it would
 restore all its Italian domestic flights - without interruption - from January
 23rd next, as Ryanair and ENAC today reached agreement that all passengers
 intending to travel on Ryanair's domestic Italian flights will provide either a
 passport or valid EU/EEA National Identity Card in full compliance with the
 security requirements, which apply on all Ryanair flights across the EU.
Because Ryanair operates a policy of 100% web check-in, it is imperative for the
 safety and security of all Ryanair flights, that cabin crew and boarding gate
 agents can readily identify all intending passengers and this is why Ryanair
 requires all passengers to produce either a passport or an EU/EEA National
 Identity Card, regardless of whether the flight is an international or domestic
 flight in Europe.
Ryanair welcomes today's agreement with ENAC which enhances the ID and security
 requirements on all Italian domestic flights and looks forward to the
 uninterrupted continuation of Ryanair's domestic Italian flights from 23rd
 January next.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Restores All Italian Domestic Flights
Speaking in Rome, Ryanair's Director of Ground Operations, Adrian Dunne said:
"We are pleased that today's agreement with ENAC will allow Ryanair's domestic
 flights in Italy to continue uninterrupted after 23rd January next. We believe
 that ENAC's new Ordinanza, which requires all passengers on domestic Italian
 flights to produce either a passport or an approved EU/EEA National Identity
 Card at the airport, enhances the safety and security of domestic flights within
 Italy.
"We would like to thank ENAC's Director General, Mr Alessio Quaranta and the
 Italian authorities for their help and assistance in resolving this dispute, and
 we will now be contacting all passengers with bookings on Ryanair's Italian
 domestic flights after the 23rd January to reassure them that their flights will
 operate as scheduled, without interruption and to ensure that all passengers
 travelling on these flights will produce either a passport or an approved EU/EEA
 National Identity Card, as they agreed to at the time of booking their flights
 on www.ryanair.com."

 Ryanair Investor Update
December traffic grows 12% to 5m
2009 traffic grows 13% to 65m
Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, held an investor briefing today (7th Jan
 10) during which it confirmed the following updates:
*  December traffic grew 12% to 4.9m pax; load factor rose 2% to 82%.
*  Annual traffic grew 13% to 65.3m for calendar year 2009.
*  Over 50% of y/e March 2011 fuel now hedged at approx $720 per tonne.
*  Annual capex to decline from EUR1.2bn (cur yr) to EUR100m p.a. (y/e Mar 2013)
*  There is no truth or basis to recent Irish media speculation that Ryanair is
 preparing a third bid for Aer Lingus. In the absence of any decision by the
 Irish Govt to sell its 25% stake, a third bid by Ryanair remains 'highly
 unlikely'.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said,
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Investor Update
"As our December traffic shows Ryanair is growing strongly and remains on course
 to carry over 66m passengers in the current fiscal year which makes Ryanair the
 world's favourite international airline. We have hedged over 50% of our fuel for
 the year ending March 2011 at approx $720 per tonne. With the unsuccessful
 termination of our talks with Boeing for a 200 aircraft order in December,
 planned capital expenditure will now decline from EUR1.2bn in the current year to
 as little as EUR100m p.a. in fiscal year ending March 2013.
"We expect our current cash reserves of EUR2.5bn to grow substantially by March
 2013 and we plan to distribute surplus cash to shareholders from that date. Our
 position on Aer Lingus remains unchanged. A third bid is highly unlikely unless
 or until the Irish Government decides to dispose of its 25% stake in this loss
 making, increasingly marginalised, regional carrier".
Ryanair's December 2009 traffic stats are as follows:

RYANAIR CONFIRMS BOEING NEGOTIATIONS HAVE TERMINATED UNSUCCESSFULLY
Ryanair, today (Fri 18th Dec 09) confirmed that its quarterly Board meeting
 yesterday determined that its negotiations with Boeing for an order of up to 200
 new B737-800 series aircraft for delivery during the period 2013-2016 cannot be
 successfully concluded prior to the end of the calendar year and accordingly the
 Board of Ryanair have confirmed that its negotiations with Boeing have
 terminated unsuccessfully.
Ryanair confirmed that the breakdown of these negotiations will not effect its
 plans to take delivery of 112 B737-800 aircraft during the next 3 calendar years
 2010 (48), 2011 (37) and 2012 (27), which will sustain Ryanair's strong traffic
 growth over the medium term. Ryanair will now bring forward plans to
 significantly reduce growth and capital expenditures, in order to maximise cash
 balances for distribution to shareholders during the period 2012-2015.
Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said:
"We regret that our prolonged negotiations with Boeing have failed to reach a
 mutually acceptable conclusion. While we reached agreement with Boeing on
 pricing for 200 aircraft deliveries during the 2013-16 period, Boeing were
Ryanair Holdings PLC Boeing Negotiations Terminated Unsuccessfully
 unwilling to incorporate some other terms and conditions from our existing
 agreement into this new aircraft order . Ryanair has made clear to Boeing that
 we will not order aircraft if we believe that either the pricing or the other
 contractual terms and conditions will be inferior to those which we currently
 enjoy, as this would not be a wise or sensible use of shareholders funds.
"We have no plans to reopen discussions with Boeing or any other aircraft
 manufacturers. Instead we will focus our efforts on maintaining Ryanair's strong
 traffic and new route growth into 2010 and we look forward to briefing
 shareholders in the first quarter of the New Year with a revised strategy which
 will comprise much reduced capital expenditures through 2011 and 2012, thereby
 generating substantial surplus cash balances for distribution during the period
 2012-2015.  I believe it is appropriate to return these surplus funds to
 shareholders, if we cannot use them to purchase aircraft on terms which enable
 us to meet our demanding return on capital targets.
"In the meantime we will continue to work with our partners in Boeing on the 48
 deliveries which Ryanair is scheduled to take in 2010 and perhaps in future
 there may be other opportunities for Ryanair and Boeing to work together to our
 mutual benefit during the period from 2013 onwards".

 Ryanair switches Alicante and Faro routes from Shannon
 to Kerry and Knock
Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, today (16th Dec 09) announced that it
 will switch its Alicante and Faro routes from Shannon Airport to Kerry and Knock
 from 30th March after Shannon Airport refused Ryanair's offer to keep four based
 aircraft in Shannon. As a result Ryanair's Shannon base will be reduced to one
 aircraft from 28th March 2010.
Ryanair's new Kerry and Knock routes, which go on sale on www.ryanair.com
 tomorrow, have been made possible thanks to lower costs at these airports
 compared to high cost Shannon.
Ryanair celebrated its new routes by releasing 1m EUR5 seats for travel Tuesdays,
 Wednesdays and Thursdays on over 500 routes across its European network in
 January. These EUR5 seats are available for booking on www.ryanair.com until
 midnight Thursday (17th Dec).
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
 "Ryanair is pleased to announce new Kerry and Knock routes to/from Alicante and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Switches Shannon Routes to Kerry and Knock
 Faro from summer 2010. These routes switch directly from Shannon Airport because
 of Shannon's high costs.
"As commercially run airports, Kerry and Knock realise that airports and
 airlines must work together to reduce the cost of travel to Ireland as the Irish
 Government's suicidal EUR10 tourist tax continues to collapse Irish traffic and
 tourism.  Shannon Airport will suffer steep traffic declines in 2010 because
 they prefer to impose high charges which render Shannon uncompetitive for
 visitors to the West of Ireland".

 TRAVEL TAX COSTS EUR482M, 3,000 JOBS &
 1.2M DEPARTING PASSENGERS
...... and all for a tax take of just EUR116m
A report published today (26th November) by aviation experts, Amsterdam Aviation
 Economics, confirmed that the Irish government's EUR10 travel tax will result in
 revenue losses of EUR482 million, up to 3,000 lost jobs and 1.2 million less
 departing passengers, yet will generate just EUR116 million in tax revenues in the
 first year following its introduction.*
The report, which was commissioned by Aer Lingus, Cityjet and Ryanair, who
 between them account for 83% of air travel passengers to and from Ireland, also
 warned of further losses to the Government as a result of its travel tax when
 reduced income tax, increased unemployment benefits, reduced VAT receipts and
 declining corporate tax are taken into account.
The chief executives of Aer Lingus, Cityjet and Ryanair again called on the
 Irish Government to axe the EUR10 travel tax which has had a devastating impact on
 airport traffic and visitor numbers since it was introduced on 30th March
 last.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Joint Report from Aer Lingus , Ryanair and Cityjet
Christoph Mueller (Aer Lingus), Geoffrey O'Byrne-White (Cityjet) and Michael
 O'Leary (Ryanair) said.
"This tax is completely counter productive and costing the country more than it
 can ever hope to generate. It does not make sense to sacrifice huge revenues and
 lose jobs and passengers by imposing a tax which will generate just EUR116
 million. We have always warned that the direct revenue generated by the travel
 tax would be significantly less than it would cost the State when the adverse
 impact on business, tourism, jobs and lost taxation receipts were taken into
 account. This view has now been vindicated by the findings of today's report".
The report found that the Irish airlines have absorbed most of the tax and have
 been forced to reduce capacity and move aircraft to bases outside Ireland as a
 direct result of the imposition of the tax.
Jan Veldhuis of Amsterdam Aviation Economics said:
"Our analysis clearly demonstrates that the travel tax in Ireland has resulted
 in a decline in revenues of a far greater magnitude than the tax likely to be
 collected. Airlines have had to absorb the tax in lower fares to maintain
 volumes and, as this will be unsustainable, capacity will further reduce as
 airlines continue to move aircraft to lower cost markets where no travel tax
 applies. This will have a further detrimental impact on the Irish economy and
 the tourism industry. The reduced airline network is impacting on connectivity
 to Ireland, making it less attractive to visit and to do business in Ireland,
 which is an impediment to economic recovery".
Editors Notes:
 The report entitled 'The Implications of the Irish Air Travel Tax' was compiled
 by the Amsterdam Aviation Economics (AAE) part of SEO Economic Research. It was
 commissioned by Aer Lingus, Ryanair and CityJet to quantify the effects of the
 air travel tax.
The Irish Air Travel Tax (ATT) imposes a tax of EUR10 per passenger to all flights
 from Irish airports to airports which are situated more than 300 kilometres from
 Dublin Airport. For flights from Irish airports to airports within this limit a
 reduced rate of EUR2 applies.
A similar tax introduced in the Netherlands on 1 July 2008 was abolished one
 year later when it became clear, following a similar report carried out by
 Amsterdam Aviation Economics, that the tax had direct negative effects on
 passenger numbers and economic sectors linked to the aviation industry.
* Results of the implementation of the Irish ATT if the tax is (partly) absorbed
 by the airlines and capacity from Irish airports has been reduced:

 EasyJet Warns of "Tough Winter" Because They Can't Compete
 with Ryanair's Low Fares
Ryanair today (17 Nov 09) rejected EasyJet's latest claims that it offered
 better value than Ryanair. Ryanair's 66m passengers are never wrong. The only
 reason why EasyJet is able to carry 45m passengers is because many of these
 people could not get seats on Ryanair's fully booked aircraft.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
"Passengers prefer Ryanair's average fare of GBP30 because it's half than
 EasyJet's fare of GBP60. This is why Ryanair is adding new bases and new routes
 all over Europe while Easyjet is closing bases and pulling aircraft from Luton,
 Liverpool, East Midlands, Bristol and Rome Ciampino.  EasyJet's results today
 show their ex-fuel unit costs have risen 6% in the past year while Ryanair has
 reduced its ex fuel unit costs by 5%.  The gap between Ryanair and high cost
 EasyJet is getting wide,r which is why EasyJet is slowing growth and pulling
 routes.
"In order for Ryanair to match EasyJet we would have to double our average fare,
 something we have no intention in doing because this winter we will lower our
Ryanair Holdings PLC EasyJet Can't Compete with Ryanair 's Low Fares
 fares even further to insure an even "tougher winter" for high fare airlines
 like EasyJet, BA and others".

 RYANAIR WELCOMES BA AND IBERIA'S WHITE FLAG
Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, today (13th Nov 09) welcomed the
 inevitable merger of British Airways and Iberia - two of Europe's high fares,
 fuel surcharging airlines.  This merger is the latest in a long line of European
 high fares airlines merging because they can't compete with Ryanair's lowest
 fares and no fuel surcharge flights.
In recent years Lufthansa has taken control of Swiss, Austrian, SN Brussels and
 BMI while Air France has bought KLM and Alitalia.  Ryanair believes that all of
 these mergers will lead to higher fares and even more fuel surcharges from these
 flag carriers.
Today's announcement bears out Ryanair's forecast that there will be just four
 large EU airlines - BA, Air France, Lufthansa and Ryanair, and of these four
 only Ryanair is committed to low fares and no fuel surcharges.  The combined
 BA / Iberia will carry approximately 60m pax pa with traffic declining by 4%
 /10% currently while Ryanair will still be bigger carrying over 66m pax this
 year as we grow by 15% p.a.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Welcomes BA and Iberia 's White Flag
"Flag carrier airlines throughout Europe are raising the white flag because they
 can't compete with Ryanair's rapid growth, low fares and no fuel surcharge
 guarantee.  Consolidation is the only option for these high fares airlines as
 more and more passengers switch to Ryanair's low fares.  The merger of BA and
 Iberia is like two drunks trying to prop each other up; both have reported large
 losses, both are facing a winter of industrial action and both charge high fares
 and fuel surcharges as their passengers switch to Ryanair's low fare services in
 the UK and Spain.
"Since consolidation of Europe's high fares airlines has never led to lower
 fares, this merger will be great for Ryanair's growth and we look forward to
 welcoming many more millions of BA's and Iberia's passengers as they switch to
 Ryanair's low fares flights".

 Ryanair FOUR TIMES BIGGER THAN BRITISH AIRWAYS
RYANAIR'S OCT TRAFFIC UP 15% TO 6.2m
BA'S TRAFFIC FALLS 4% TO 1.6m
Ryanair, the World's favourite airline, today (Friday, 6th November 2009)
 announced that it carried four times the UK and Europe short-haul traffic of
 British Airways (once the World's favourite airline) in October as
 6.2m passengers travelled throughout Europe on Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares
 (up 15%) while BA's short haul (UK and Europe) traffic fell by 4% to just 1.6m
 passengers.
Ryanair celebrated its continued growth and leadership over BA by releasing 1
 million GBP5 seats for travel in late November and December, which are available
 at www.ryanair.com until 24:00hrs Monday (9th Nov).
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
"Ryanair continues to grow rapidly during the recession as passengers switch to
 Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares from BA's high fares and unjustified fuel
 surcharges.  Ryanair's traffic grew by 15% in Oct to 6.2 million while BA's
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Four Times Bigger than British Airways
 comparable traffic fell by 4% to just 1.6 million. Ryanair now carries four
 times BA's traffic in the UK and Europe, their most important market. Ryanair
 will continue to grow and attract BA passengers because Ryanair will continue to
 lower fares.
"To celebrate our increased leadership over what used to be the world's
 favourite airline, but is now not even the UK's favourite, we are releasing 1m
 GBP5 seats for travel in late November and December which are available at
 www.ryanair.com until midnight Monday (9thNov)".

 revenue, partially offset by reduced project work, reduction in legacy revenue
 and lower voice revenue due to fewer minutes and changes in regulation, for more
 detail see below.
A selection of the contracts we have won over the period includes:
*  National Grid plc - a GBP207 million, 15 year agreement to deliver its core
 operational network and its wider telecommunications infrastructure;
 *  Ryanair - a EUR15 million, five year contract to manage its entire business
 critical European telecommunication network, including all airports, data
 centres and corporate offices;

Total gross margin
 Total gross margin for the first half of 2009/10 was GBP533 million, an increase
 of 29% on the equivalent period in 2008. The GBP119 million increase in gross
 margin is a result of including Thus gross margin and the continued growth of
 IP, data and hosting products. This growth was partially offset by the reduction
 in traditional voice volumes and project work due to the impact of the
Cable & Wireless PLC Half Yearly Report -8-
 recession.
Worldwide gross margin as a percentage of revenue has increased from 41% to 47%
 reflecting the continued change in our product mix towards higher margin IP,
 data and hosting.  About three and a half percentage points of this improvement
 is due to the effect of much reduced volumes of low margin traditional voice
 revenue.

IP, data and hosting - revenue and gross margin
 Worldwide IP, data and hosting revenue grew by 39% to GBP592 million in the
 first half of 2009/10 compared with GBP427 million in the equivalent period last
 year, driven by the inclusion of Thus revenue (approximately GBP135 million) and
 growth from increased demand for our strategic product set (approximately GBP50
 million) partially offset by the reduction in project work (approximately GBP20
 million).
IP, data and hosting revenue as a proportion of Worldwide revenue is 52% in the
 first half of 2009/10, up from 43% in the equivalent period of 2008/09. The
 proportion of our revenue comprising IP, data and hosting has more than doubled
 since the first half of 2005/06.
IP, data and hosting margin was GBP379 million, 64% of revenue. The margin has
 increased by GBP119 million compared with the equivalent period last year.
 Approximately GBP89 million of the improvement is a result of the inclusion of
Cable & Wireless PLC Half Yearly Report -8-
 Thus and increased demand for our strategic product set, partially offset by a
 reduction in project work. The remaining approximately GBP30 million increase in
 our IP, data and hosting gross margin includes GBP11 million from our cost
 reduction programmes, synergies from the Thus integration of GBP7 million and
 higher retrospective regulatory settlements due to the GBP12 million partial
 recognition of the Partial Private Circuits (PPCs) regulatory settlement. The
 Ofcom determination of historic charges for PPCs (part of which is recognised in
 the period) gives a slightly higher margin impact in the first half of 2009/10
 than in 2008/09.  We expect to see continuing benefits from the lower charges in
 the future.
Traditional voice - revenue and gross margin
 Traditional voice revenue in Worldwide fell by GBP3 million to GBP527 million in
 the first half of 2009/10.
The increase in voice revenue following the acquisition of Thus (approximately
 GBP110 million) was broadly offset by the impact of lower voice minutes due to
 the recession (approximately GBP50 million) as well as our decision to remove
 low margin traffic from our network (approximately GBP43 million) and changes to
 the regulated pricing of mobile termination rates and non-geographic number
 ranges (approximately GBP20 million).
Traditional voice gross margin increased by GBP15 million to GBP143 million
 compared with the equivalent period last year. This was due to the inclusion of
 margin from Thus (approximately GBP23 million), partially offset by falling
 voice minutes and the regulatory changes noted above (approximately GBP8
 million).
Traditional voice margins have increased to 27%, compared with 24% in the
 equivalent period last year, driven by the reduction in low margin traffic.
Legacy products - revenue and gross margin
 Revenue from our legacy products has reduced to GBP22 million compared with the
 first half of 2008/09 and now represents only 2% of Worldwide revenue and gross
 margin. The decline is due to the winding down of two dial-up internet services
 contracts, as customers migrate to broadband services.
As a result of the fall in revenue, gross margin from legacy products decreased
 by GBP15 million from the equivalent period in 2008/09 to GBP11 million, at a
 margin of 50% of revenue.
Operating costs
 Total operating costs were GBP328 million in the first half of 2009/10, an
 increase of GBP56 million on the first half of 2008/09 reflecting the inclusion
 of Thus operating costs (approximately GBP76 million) and an increase in
 provisions (approximately GBP12 million) partially offset by operating cost
 synergies from the Thus integration programme (approximately GBP16 million) and
Cable & Wireless PLC Half Yearly Report -8-
 continued cost reduction programmes within the existing Worldwide business
 (approximately GBP16 million).  We continue to reduce our costs as we focus on
 people and network cost savings, as well as driving best value from our
 suppliers.
EBITDA
 Worldwide EBITDA was GBP205 million in the first half of 2009/10, an increase of
 GBP63 million on the same period last year.
EBITDA as a percentage of revenue has improved from 14% to 18%. This increase
 reflects the growth in revenue of high margin IP, data and hosting products and
 the success of our Thus integration programme.
Depreciation and amortisation
 Depreciation and amortisation is GBP131 million for the first half of 2009/10
 compared with GBP88 million in the equivalent period of 2008/09, reflecting the
 level of capital expenditure in recent years, together with the GBP18 million of
 depreciation and amortisation associated with the Thus acquired asset base.
Thus integration
 The integration of Thus enterprise with our existing Worldwide business remains
 on track, with GBP23 million of EBITDA synergies recognised in the period, as
 well as GBP14 million of capital expenditure synergies delivered to date.
The target of total annualised synergies in 2011/12 has increased to GBP104
 million, as we have identified GBP14 million (GBP10 million of EBITDA and GBP4
 million of capital expenditure) of further opportunities compared to our
 expectation of GBP90 million set out in May 2009. The GBP104 million of
 synergies comprises GBP85 million of recurring EBITDA synergies and total
 avoided capital expenditure of GBP19 million.
As a result of the higher target for synergies, total costs to achieve for the
 Thus integration have increased by GBP20 million to GBP98 million, of which
 GBP73 million has been recognised to date.  The split of these total costs to
 achieve is expected to be GBP66 million of exceptional items and GBP32 million
 of capital expenditure, of which we have recognised to date GBP53 million and
 GBP20 million respectively.

 RYANAIR HALF YEAR PROFITS UP 80% TO EUR387M
 FARES FALL 17%, TRAFFIC GROWS 15% TO 36M PAX
 LOSSES IN Q3 AND Q4 LEAVES FULL YEAR GUIDANCE UNCHANGED
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (2nd Nov 09) announced an 80%
 increase in half year net profits to EUR387m. Revenues fell by 2% to EUR1.8bn, as a
 17% decline in average fares was largely offset by a 15% growth in traffic. Unit
 costs fell 27% due to lower fuel prices (excluding fuel, unit costs fell 5%) and
 rigorous cost discipline.

Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results
Highlights of the half year included:
*  Average fares down 17% to EUR39.
 *  Traffic growth up 15% to 36m pax.
 *  Net profit up 80% to EUR387m.
 *  Industry leading net profit margin of 22%.
 *  Ancillary revenues grew 8% to 20% of total revenues.
 *  Unit costs down 27% (ex fuel costs down 5%).
 *  100% web check-in from 1st October.
 *  Fuel hedges extended for fiscal 2011, Q.1 to 50% and Q.2 to 50%.
Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said:
"Ryanair's ability to grow both traffic and profits during the half year is a
 testament to the strength of Ryanair's lowest fare model, and our relentless
 cost discipline. However these results are heavily distorted by a 42% fall in
 fuel costs, which has masked a significant 17% decline in average fares. We
 expect average fares to decline by up to 20% during Quarters 3 and 4, which will
 result in both these quarters being loss making. Despite this our full year
 guidance remains unchanged and will be substantially profitable, at a time when
 many of our competitors are losing money, consolidating or going bust.  Recent
 weeks have seen the demise of SkyEurope and Seagle Air in Slovakia, and MyAir in
 Italy, and we expect further casualties this Winter. Ryanair is the only major
 European airline to grow traffic and profits strongly. We are winning
 substantial market share from the big three high fare flag carrier groups led by
 Air France, BA and Lufthansa and we expect this trend to continue.
"Market conditions in Ireland, the UK and Europe continue to be difficult,
 characterised by an absence of consumer confidence; and specific markets (i.e.
 Ireland and the UK) which have been damaged by misguided tourist taxes levied on
 air passengers but not on competing ferry or train journeys.  Traffic at many
 Irish and UK airports has slumped, with Ireland facing a decline of 15% of its
 air traffic, and the UK set to lose almost 10% of its traffic. We again call on
 the British and Irish Governments to scrap these stupid tourist taxes and reduce
 airport charges. VAT receipts on visitor spend alone would be a multiple of the
 revenues generated from these tourist taxes. The Belgian, Dutch, Greek and
 Spanish governments have led the way by scrapping passenger taxes and/or
 reducing airport charges (in some cases to zero) in order to stimulate traffic
 growth. We are switching a material proportion of Ryanair's Winter capacity and
 growth away from high tax, high cost countries like Britain and Ireland in
 favour of "no tax", lower cost countries like Belgium, Holland, Italy and Spain.
"Ryanair's relentless focus on costs continues to deliver savings. While fuel
 remains volatile, we have continued to reduce airport and handling
 costs, through our web check-in initiatives, and staff costs, with a pay freeze
 in both the current and coming year. At a time when many competitors are cutting
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results
 pay and jobs, Ryanair continues to provide secure employment without pay cuts
 for over 7,000 of the best professionals in the European airline industry.
"We continue to campaign for the break up of the BAA and DAA airport monopolies,
 which waste billions of pounds/euro building over-specified facilities which
 airline users neither want nor need, at Stansted and Dublin in particular. We
 welcome the sale of London Gatwick and again call for the early sale of Stansted
 and one of BAA's Scottish airports, so that inter airport competition can
 deliver lower costs and more efficient facilities which the BAA monopoly, and
 inept CAA regulation has repeatedly failed to deliver.
"The failure of the Irish Government to honour its promise to break up the DAA
 monopoly continues to damage Irish traffic and tourism. In 2010 the DAA monopoly
 will unfold Terminal 2, a EUR1.2bn white elephant, despite the fact that the 30
 million passengers p.a. (MPPA) capacity at Terminal 1 now substantially exceeds
 the 20 MPPA traffic at Dublin Airport. The fact that the DAA have built an
 entirely separate building just for "deep queuing check-in spaces", at a time
 when most airlines are moving to web check-in and no check-in queues, shows just
 how out of touch and clueless the DAA monopoly is. T2 should be mothballed, thus
 eliminating the enormous operating costs associated with its opening,
 particularly as the Irish economy faces a collapse of air traffic and tourism in
 the face of high airport charges and a crazy EUR10 tourist tax. It may take some
 time before the Irish Government realises that the only way forward is to lower
 airport fees and scrap tourist taxes.
"I regret to report that we have made little progress in our discussions with
 Boeing for an order of 200 aircraft for delivery between 2013 and 2016. We won't
 continue these discussions indefinitely and have signalled to Boeing that if
 they are not completed before the year end, then Ryanair will end its
 relationship with Boeing and confirm a series of order deferrals and
 cancellations. We see no point in continuing to grow rapidly in a declining
 yield environment, where our main aircraft partner is unwilling to play its part
 in our cost reduction programme by passing on some of the enormous savings which
 Boeing have enjoyed both from suppliers and more efficient manufacturing in
 recent years.
"We would prefer to grow, but if Boeing doesn't share our vision, then I believe
 that Ryanair should change course before the end of this fiscal year and manage
 the airline over the next three years to maximise cash for distribution to
 shareholders. If we cannot invest our surplus cash efficiently in new aircraft,
 then we should distribute it to shareholders.
"It is appropriate at a time of economic difficulty to remain cautious and
 conservative in our guidance. Our outlook for fiscal 2009/10 remains unchanged.
 Traffic growth is strong, but at the expense of declining average fares.
 Ryanair's yields are being negatively impacted by the weakness of Sterling
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results
 and tourist taxes in the UK and Ireland. We expect yields this Winter will
 continue to fall by up to 20%, which will cause material losses in Q.3 and Q.4
 and accordingly our full year net profit guidance remains at the lower end of
 the EUR200m to EUR300m range - as we previously guided.
"While this Winter will be a difficult one for the European airline industry,
 Ryanair will continue to grow traffic, market share and profits. We have the
 strongest balance sheet in the European airline industry with over EUR2.5bn in
 cash and we continue to negotiate significant cost reductions with airports and
 handling companies who are keen to share in our growth, while other customers
 consolidate or collapse. Ryanair remains ideally positioned to return to
 substantial profit growth as Europe emerges from this economic downturn and we
 remain confident that our "growth during a recession" policy will continue to
 deliver substantial returns for our passengers, our people and our
 shareholders".

 impact of the movement in euro/sterling exchange rates.Load factor remained flat
 at 88% compared to the period ended September 30, 2008.
Ancillary revenues increased by 3% to EUR181.0m, slower than the 18% rise in
 passenger volumes due to a decline in average spend per passenger primarily due
 to lower excess baggage revenues, and the adverse impact of the movement in
 euro/sterling exchange rates.
Total operating expenses decreased by 16% to EUR694.2m  primarily due to the
 42% decrease in fuel prices and 5% unit cost reductions (ex fuel) delivered in
 the period offset somewhat by the higher level of activity and costs associated
 with the growth of the airline.
Staff costs increased by 8% to EUR86.2m.  This reflects an 11% increase in average
 employee headcount to 7,181, offset by the impact of a company wide pay freeze,
 the higher portion of contract crew operating during the period, and the rise in
 cabin crew numbers who earn lower than the average salary.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 13% to EUR56.3m. This reflects, net of
 disposals, an additional 22 aircraft or a 17% increase in lower cost 'owned'
 aircraft in the fleet this quarter compared to the quarter ended September 30,
 2008 and the impact of overhaul checks undertaken during the period
Fuel costs decreased by 42% to EUR245.7m primarily due to the lower cost of fuel
 in the period.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -11-
Maintenance costs increased by 29% to EUR21.1m due to an increase in the number of
 leased aircraft from 39 to 51 and additional costs arising from increased line
 maintenance activity at new bases.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 22% to EUR23.3m, which is lower than the 31%
 increase in the number of leased aircraft from 39 to 51 compared to the period
 ended September 30, 2008, reflecting the positive impact of lower lease rentals
 achieved.
Route charges rose by 21% to EUR92.7m due to an increase in the number of sectors
 flown and an increase in average unit rates, offset by the positive impact of
 euro/sterling exchange rates.
Airport & handling charges increased by 7% to EUR132.8m due to an 18% increase in
 passenger volumes, offset by lower costs at new airports and bases launched and
 savings achieved on handling costs.
Marketing, distribution and other expenses increased by 3% to EUR36.1m, due to
 improved margins on some existing products, cost reductions on some indirect
 costs and the increased focus on internet based promotions.
Operating margin increased by 10 points to 30% due to the reasons outlined above
 and operating profits have increased by EUR87.2m to EUR297.9m compared to the period
 ended September 30, 2008.
Finance income decreased by 75% to EUR5.9m primarily due to the impact of lower
 base interest rates and the prudent placement of funds with highly rated and
 guaranteed financial institutions which typically provide a lower yield.
Finance expense decreased by 40% to EUR17.0m primarily due to the impact of lower
 interest rates offset by the drawdown of debt to part finance the purchase of
 new aircraft.
Foreign exchange losses during the quarter of EUR3.3m are primarily due to the
 impact of changes in the sterling rate against the euro.

 Interim Management Report
Introduction
This half-yearly financial report for the six month period ended September 30,
 2009 meets the reporting requirements pursuant to the Transparency (Directive
 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and Transparency Rules of the Republic of
 Ireland's Financial Regulator and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the
 United Kingdom's Financial Services Authority.
This interim management report includes the following:
*  Reconciliation of results for the period under International Financial Reporting
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -11-
 Standards ("IFRS") to adjusted results for the half-year period and quarter
 ended September 30, 2009;
*  Principal risks and uncertainties relating to the remaining six months of the
 year;
*  Related party transactions; and
*  Post balance sheet events.
Results of operations for the six month period ended September 30, 2009 compared
 to the six month period ended September 30, 2008, including important events
 that occurred during the half-year are set forth in the Operating and Financial
 review on pages 10-14.
Reconciliation of results for the period under IFRS to adjusted results for the
 half year period and quarter ended September 30, 2009
The unaudited condensed consolidated interim income statements for the half-year
 period and quarter ended September 30, 2009, as set forth on pages 5 and 6 of
 this half-yearly financial report, presents the results for the periods
 separately between pre-exceptional and exceptional items. Certain items are
 presented separately, as exceptional items, which, by virtue of their size or
 incidence, are unusual in the context of the Groups's ongoing core operations,
 as we believe this presentation represents the underlying business more
 accurately and reflects the manner in which investors typically analyse the
 results.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact
 Ryanair's expected results for the second half of the year are the airline
 pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers,
 market prices for the replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental,
 safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, UK, European Union ("EU")
 and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, fluctuations in
 currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour
 relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the general
 economic environment in Ireland, the UK, and Continental Europe, the general
 willingness of passengers to travel and other economic, social and political
 factors.

Independent review report of KPMG to Ryanair
 Holdings plc
Introduction
We have been engaged by Ryanair Holdings plc ("the Company") to review the
 condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended
 September 30, 2009, which comprise the condensed consolidated interim balance
 sheet, the condensed consolidated interim income statement, the condensed
 consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income, the condensed
 consolidated interim statement of cash flows, the condensed consolidated interim
 statement of changes in shareholders' equity and the related notes thereto. We
 have read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report
 and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material
 inconsistencies with the information in the condensed consolidated interim
 financial statements.
This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with the terms of our
 engagement to assist the Company in meeting the requirements of the Transparency
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -14-
 (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and the Transparency Rules of the
 Republic of Ireland's Financial Regulator and the Disclosure and Transparency
 Rules of the UK's Financial Services Authority ("the FSA"). Our review has been
 undertaken so that we might state to the Company those matters we are required
 to state to it in this report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
 permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than
 the Company for our review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have
 reached.
Directors' responsibilities
The half-yearly financial report, including the condensed consolidated interim
 financial statements contained therein, is the responsibility of, and has been
 approved by, the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the
 interim report in accordance with the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC)
 Regulations 2007 and the Transparency Rules of the Republic of Ireland's
 Financial Regulator and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the UK FSA.
As disclosed in note 1 - basis of preparation, the annual consolidated financial
 statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with International
 Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRSs') as issued by the International
 Accounting Standards Board and adopted by the European Union ('EU'). The
 condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this half-yearly
 financial report have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, "Interim
 Financial Reporting," as adopted by the EU.
Our responsibility
Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed
 consolidated interim financial statements in the half-yearly financial report,
 based on our review.
Scope of review
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review
 Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information
 Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity issued by the Auditing
 Practices Board for use in Ireland and the UK. A review of interim financial
 information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for
 financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review
 procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
 accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and
 consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware
 of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we
 do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -14-
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe
 that the condensed consolidated interim financial statements in the half-yearly
 financial report for the six months ended September 30, 2009 are not prepared,
 in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted by the EU, the
 Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and the Transparency Rules
 of the Republic of Ireland's Financial Regulator and the Disclosure and
 Transparency Rules of the UK FSA.

 condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the six
 months ended September 30, 2009 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries
 (together referred to as the "Group").
These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the
 interim financial statements"), which should be read in conjunction with our
 2009 Annual Report, have been prepared in accordance with International
 Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as adopted by the
 EU ("IAS 34"). They do not include all of the information required for full
 annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most
 recent published consolidated financial statements of the Group. The
 consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the year ended
 March 31, 2009 are available at www.ryanair.com.
 The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2009 do not
 constitute statutory financial statements of the Group within the meaning of
 Regulation 40 of the European Communities (Companies, Group Accounts)
 Regulations, 1992. Statutory financial statements for the year ended March 31,
 2009 have been filed with the Companies' Office. The auditors' report on those
 financial statements was unqualified.
In addition to the presentation of the condensed consolidated interim financial
 statements for the half-year period ended September 30, 2009, the condensed
 consolidated income statement and condensed consolidated statement of
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -12-
 comprehensive income for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 have also been
 provided on a supplementary basis and have been prepared in accordance with the
 measurement and recognition principles of IFRS as adopted by the EU.  The
 quarterly financial information does not include all information required for
 interim financial reporting under IAS 34.
 The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors,
 approved the interim financial statements for the six months ended September 30,
 2009 on October 30, 2009.
Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been
 prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most
 recent published consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in
 accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and in compliance with IFRSs as issued
 by the International Accounting Standards Board.
The following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the
 first time for the financial year beginning 1 April 2009.
*  IFRS 8 - Operating Segments ("IFRS 8"). We adopted IFRS 8 which replaces IAS 14
 - Segmental Reporting ("IAS 14"), during the six months ended 30 September 2009.
 IFRS 8 requires a "management approach" under which segment information is
 presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes. IAS 14
 required identification of two sets of segments - one based on business units
 and the other on geographical areas. IFRS 8 requires additional disclosures
 around identifying segments and their products and services. Our operations are
 organised as a single business unit, that of the provision of low-fares
 airline-related activities, including scheduled services, car hire, internet
 income and related sales to third parties. There has been no change to the
 operating segment as a result of the adoption of IFRS 8 and the reportable
 segment is consistent with that previously reported under the primary business
 segment format of the segment reporting under IAS 14. The additional disclosures
 around identifying segments and their products and services will be disclosed in
 the 2010 annual financial statements.  Comparative segment information has been
 represented, where necessary, in conformity with the transitional requirements
 of IFRS 8. Since the change in accounting policy only impacts the presentation
 and disclosure aspects, there is no impact on reported results or earnings per
 share.
*  IAS 1 (revised) - Presentation of Financial Statements. The revised standard
 prohibits the presentation of items of income and expenses (that is "non owner
 changes in equity") in the statement of changes in equity, requiring "non owner
 changes in equity" to be presented separately from owner changes in equity. All
 "non owner changes in equity" are required to be shown in a performance
 statement. Entities can choose whether to present one performance statement (the
 statement of comprehensive income) or two statements (the income statement and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -12-
 the statement of comprehensive income). We have elected to present two
 statements: an income statement and a statement of comprehensive income. Also,
 the revised standard includes the statement of changes in shareholders' equity
 as a primary statement, rather than as a note to the financial statements.
*  Amendment to IFRS 7 "Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments".The
 relevant aspects of the amendment will be addressed in the 2010 Annual Report
 disclosures.
The following standards, amendments to IFRS standards, IFRIC interpretations and
 improvements to IFRSs are mandatory for the first time for the financial year
 beginning 1 April 2009, but did not have an impact on the Company.
 *  Amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 27 "Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary,
 Jointly-Controlled Entity or Associate";
 *  Amendment to IFRS 2, "Share-based Payment - Vesting Conditions and
 Cancellations";
 *  Amendment to IAS 23, "Borrowing Costs";
 *  Amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1 regarding puttable financial instruments and
 obligations arising on liquidation;
 *  Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7, "Reclassification of Financial Assets";
 *  Amendment to IFRIC 9 and IAS 39 "Embedded Derivatives";
 *  IFRIC 15, "Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate";
 *  IFRIC 16, "Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation";
 *  IFRIC 17, "Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners";
 *  IFRIC 18, "Transfer of Assets from Customers"; and
 *  'Improvements to IFRSs 2008' (issued in May 2008).
The following standards, amendments to IFRS standards and interpretations have
 been issued, but are not effective for the financial year beginning 1 April 2009
 and have not been early adopted by the Company:
 *  IFRS 3 (revised) - Business Combinations and consequential amendments to IAS 27
 - Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, IAS 28 - Investments in
 Associates and IAS 31 - Interests in Joint Ventures, effective prospectively to
 business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the
 beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 July
 2009.
 *  Amendment to IFRS 2, "Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions";
 *  Amendment to IAS 32 "Classification of Rights Issues";
 *  Amendment to IAS 39 "Eligible Hedged Items"; and
 *  'Improvement to IFRSs 2009' (issued in April 2009).
Exceptional items
 The Company presents certain items separately, which are unusual, by virtue of
 their size and incidence, in the context of our ongoing core operations, as we
 believe this presentation represents the underlying business more accurately and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -12-
 reflects the manner in which investors typically analyse the results. In the
 current and prior period comparative we have presented an impairment of a
 financial asset investment and also accelerated depreciation related to aircraft
 disposals separately because of the unusual nature of these items. Any amounts
 deemed "exceptional" for management discussion and analysis purposes have been
 classified for the purposes of the income statement in the same way as non
 exceptional amounts of the same nature.
2.  Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements,
 estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual
 results may differ from these estimates.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements
 made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key
 sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the
 most recent published consolidated financial statements.
3.  Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to
 quarter, and management expects these variations to continue. Among the factors
 causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to general
 economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Accordingly the first
 half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
4.  Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the
 half-year ended September 30, 2009 was 10.9% (2008: 9.4%). The tax charge for
 the half-year ended September 30, 2009 of EUR45.9m (2008: EUR9.9m) primarily
 comprises a deferred tax charge relating to the utilisation of previous trading
 losses.
5.  Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most
 recent published consolidated financial statements.  The charge to the income
 statement in the half-year of approximately EUR2.8m (2008: EUR1.5m) is related to
 the fair value of various share options granted in prior periods, which are
 being recognised within the income statement in accordance with employee
 services rendered.
6.  Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its
 business.  The Group does not believe that any such litigation will individually
 or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
 Group. Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, management
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -12-
 believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not
 expected to materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or
 financial position.

7.  Capital commitments
 At September 30, 2009 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 202 (2008: 168) Boeing
 737-800 aircraft. It also had firm orders for an additional 110 Boeing
 737-800's. The delivery of these firm order aircraft will increase the fleet
 size (net of planned disposals) to 292 aircraft by March 31, 2012.
8.  Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR93.2m at March 31,
 2009 to EUR119.7m at September 30, 2009 is comprised of an impairment charge of
 EUR13.5m on its shareholding in Aer Lingus, recognised in the income statement,
 reflecting a further decline in the Aer Lingus share price from EUR0.59 per share
 at March 31, 2009 to EUR0.50 at June 30, 2009. This impairment charge is offset by
 a gain of EUR40.1m, recognised through reserves, reflecting the subsequent
 increase in the share price to EUR0.75 per share at September 30, 2009. All such
 impairment losses are required to be recognised in the income statement and are
 not subsequently reversed, while gains are recognised through reserves.
9.  Analysis of operating segment
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares
 airline-related activities, including scheduled services, car hire, internet
 income and related sales to third parties. The Company operates a single fleet
 of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 As of April 1, 2009 the Company determines and presents operating segments based
 on the information that internally is provided to the CEO, who is the Company's
 Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). When making resource allocation decisions
 the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -13-
 decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the
 entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in type. The objective in making
 resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial results,
 rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated
 adjusted profit/(loss) after tax of the Company for the period. This measure
 excludes the effects of certain income and expense items, which are unusual, by
 virtue of their size and incidence, in the context of the Company's ongoing core
 operations, such as the impairment of a financial asset investment and
 accelerated depreciation related to aircraft disposals (see reconciliation on
 page 15).
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company
 has a single reportable segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which
 is flexibly employed across the Company's integrated route network and is
 directly attributable to its reportable segment operations. In addition, as the
 Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and liabilities
 have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
 There have been no changes to the basis of segmentation or the measurement basis
 for the segment profit or loss since March 31, 2009.

 reflecting an impairment of the Aer Lingus shareholding. Exceptional items in
 the half year ended September 30, 2008 amounted to EUR119.3m consisting of an
 impairment of the Aer Lingus shareholding of EUR93.6m and an accelerated
 depreciation charge of EUR25.7m on aircraft disposed in financial years 2009 and
 2010.
Adjusted profit after tax excluding exceptional items increased by 80% to
 EUR387.0m. Including exceptional items the profit after tax for the half year
 amounted to EUR373.5m compared to a profit of EUR95.3m in the half year ended
 September 30, 2008.
 Summary half year ended September 30, 2009
Adjusted profit after tax increased by 80% to EUR387.0m compared to EUR214.6m in the
 half year ended September 30, 2008 primarily due to a 42% decrease in fuel
 costs, partially offset by a 17% decline in average fares.  Total operating
 revenues decreased by 2% to EUR1,766.8m as average fares fell by 17% due to the
 recession, price promotions, and the adverse impact of the movement in
 euro/sterling exchange rates. Ancillary revenues grew by 8% to EUR346.3m, lower
 than the increase in passenger volumes, due to a decline in average spend per
 passenger primarily due to lower excess baggage revenues, and the negative
 impact of the movement in euro/sterling exchange rates.  Total revenue per
 passenger as a result decreased by 15%, whilst the Load Factor remained flat at
 85% during the period.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -10-
Total operating expenses fell by 17% to EUR1,314.2m, primarily due to lower fuel
 prices, offset by the higher level of activity and increased operating costs
 associated with the growth of the airline.  Fuel, which represents 35% of total
 operating costs compared to 50% in the comparative period, decreased by 42% to
 EUR459.8m due to the fall in the price per gallon paid offset by an increase in
 the number of hours flown.  Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 5% and including
 fuel they fell by 27%.  Operating margin increased by 13 points to 26% whilst
 operating profit increased by EUR216.2m to EUR452.6m.
Net margins increased to 22% from 12% at September 30, 2008 for the reasons
 outlined above.
Adjusted earnings per share for the period were 26.23 cent compared to 14.44
 cent in the previous half year ended September 30, 2008.
Balance sheet
 Total cash and cash equivalents remained strong at EUR2,536.9m.  The Group
 generated cash from operating activities of EUR382.8m and a further EUR65.6m
 delivery proceeds on the sale of three Boeing 737-800 aircraft which together
 partially funded capital expenditure incurred during the period.  Capital
 expenditure of EUR386.8m largely consisted of advance aircraft payments for future
 aircraft deliveries and the delivery of 24 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft in the
 half year.  Total debt, net of repayments, increased by EUR187.7m to EUR2,586.1m
 during the period.  Net debt at period end was EUR49.2m.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Half Year ended September 30, 2009
Adjusted profit after tax, increased by EUR172.4m to EUR387.0m primarily due to
 lower fuel costs, partially offset by a 17% decline in average fares.  Total
 operating revenues decreased by 2% to EUR1,766.8m as average fares fell by 17% due
 to the recession, price promotions, the adverse impact of the movement in
 euro/sterling exchange rates and a decline in ancillary revenues per passenger,
 offset by a 15% increase in passenger numbers.  Fuel, which represents 35% of
 total operating costs compared to 50% in the prior period comparative, decreased
 by 42% to EUR459.8m due to the fall in the price per gallon paid offset by an
 increase in the number of hours flown.  Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 5%
 and including fuel they fell by 27%.   Operating margin, as a result, increased
 by 13 points to 26%, whilst operating profit increased by EUR216.2m to EUR452.6m.
Total operating revenues decreased by 2% to EUR1,766.8m, slower than the 15%
 increase in passenger traffic to 36.4m, which was offset by a 17% decline in
 average fares.
Total revenue per passenger decreased by 15% due to a 7% decline in ancillary
 revenues per passenger and a 17% fall in average fares.
Scheduled passenger revenues decreased by 5% to EUR1,420.5m due to a 15% rise in
 passenger volumes on existing routes offset by a 17% decrease in average fares,
 due to the recession, price promotions, lower baggage penetration rates, and the
 adverse impact of the movement in euro/sterling exchange rates.Load
 factor remained flat at 85%, compared to the period ended September 30, 2008.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -10-
Ancillary revenues increased by 8% to EUR346.3m, slower than the 15% increase in
 passenger volume, due to a decline in  average spend per passenger primarily due
 to lower excess baggage revenues, and the adverse impact of the movement in
 euro/sterling exchange rates.
Total operating expenses decreased by 17% to EUR1,314.2m primarily due to the
 42% decrease in fuel prices and 5% unit cost reductions (ex fuel) delivered in
 the period offset somewhat by the higher level of activity and costs associated
 with the growth of the airline.
Staff costs increased by 5% to EUR168.6m.  This reflects an 11% increase in
 average employee headcount to 7,059, offset by the impact of a company wide pay
 freeze, the higher portion of contract crew operating during the period, and the
 rise in cabin crew numbers during the period who earn lower than the average
 salary.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 15% to EUR111.3m. This reflects, net of
 disposals, an additional 22 aircraft or a 17% increase in lower cost 'owned'
 aircraft in the fleet this period compared to the period ended September 30,
 2008 and the impact of overhaul checks undertaken during the period.
Fuel costs decreased by 42% to EUR459.8m primarily due to the lower cost of fuel
 in the period.
Maintenance costs increased by 32% to EUR40.3m due to an increase in the number of
 leased aircraft from 39 to 51 and additional costs arising from increased line
 maintenance activity at new bases.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 18% to EUR45.0m, which is lower than the 31%
 increase in the number of leased aircraft from 39 to 51 compared to the period
 ended September 30, 2008, reflecting the positive impact of lower lease rentals
 achieved.
Route charges rose by 15% to EUR173.9m due to an increase in the number of sectors
 flown and an increase in average unit rates, offset by the positive impact of
 euro/sterling exchange rates.
Airport & handling charges increased by 5% to EUR249.5m due to a 15% increase in
 passenger volumes, offset by lower costs at new airports and bases launched and
 savings achieved on handling costs.
Marketing, distribution and other expenses decreased by 7% to EUR65.8m, due to
 improved margins on some existing products, cost reductions on some indirect
 costs and the increased focus on internet based promotions.
Operating margin increased by 13 points to 26% due to the reasons outlined above
 and operating profits have increased by EUR216.2m to EUR452.6m compared to the
 period ended September 30, 2008.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -10-
Finance income decreased by 71% to EUR13.3m primarily due to the impact of lower
 base interest rates and the prudent placement of funds with highly rated and
 guaranteed financial institutions which typically provide a lower yield.
Finance expense decreased by 40% to EUR35.3m primarily due to the impact of lower
 interest rates offset by the drawdown of debt to part finance the purchase of
 new aircraft.
Foreign exchange losses during the period of EUR0.6m are primarily due to the
 impact of movement in the sterling rate against the euro.
Balance sheet
 Total cash and cash equivalents remained strong at EUR2,536.9m.  The Group
 generated cash from operating activities of EUR382.8m and a further
 EUR65.6m delivery proceeds on the sale of three Boeing 737-800 aircraft which
 together partially funded capital expenditure incurred during the period.
 Capital expenditure amounted to EUR386.8m which largely consisted of advance
 aircraft payments for future aircraft deliveries and the delivery of 24 new
 Boeing 737-800 aircraft.  Total debt, net of repayments, increased by EUR187.7m
 during the period to EUR2,856.1m.  Net debt at period end was EUR49.2m
Shareholders' Equity at September 30, 2009 increased by EUR325.0m to EUR2,750.1,
 compared to March 31, 2009 due to the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for
 derivative financial assets, stock option grants, profit of EUR373.5m in the
 period and the issue of shares of EUR9.4m (as detailed on page 9).
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Quarter ended September 30, 2009
Adjusted profit after tax, increased by EUR56.9m to EUR250.5m primarily due to lower
 fuel costs, partially offset by a 20% decline in average fares.  Total operating
 revenues decreased by 4% to EUR992.1m as average fares fell by 20% due to the
 recession, price promotions, the adverse impact of the movement in euro/sterling
 exchange rates and a decline in ancillary revenues per passenger, offset by an
 18% increase in passenger numbers.  Fuel, which represents 35% of total
 operating costs compared to 51% in the prior period comparative, decreased by
 42% to EUR245.7m due to the fall in the price per gallon paid offset by an
 increase in the number of hours flown.  Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 5%
 and including fuel they fell by 29%.   Operating margin, as a result, increased
 by 10 points to 30%, whilst operating profit increased by EUR87.2m to EUR297.9m.
Total operating revenues decreased by 4% to EUR992.1m, slower than the 18%
 increase in passenger traffic to 19.7m which was offset by a 20% decline in
 average fares.
Total revenue per passenger decreased by 19% due to a 20% fall in average fares
 and a slower growth of ancillary revenues.
Scheduled passenger revenues decreased by 6% to EUR811.1m due to an 18% rise in
 passenger volumes, offset by a 20% decrease in average fares, due to the
 recession, price promotions, lower baggage penetration rates, and the adverse

 entered into discussions with Shannon Airport about the terms for an extension
 of Ryanair's 5 year base agreement at Shannon which runs out in April 2010.
 Under the current 5 year agreement which was signed in late 2004, Ryanair has
 invested over $400m in Shannon Airport, and has grown its annual traffic at
 Shannon from 300,000 passengers in 2004, to 1.9m last year, prior to the
 introduction in April 2009 of the Government's EUR10 tourist tax.
Since the Government's EUR10 tourist tax was introduced on April Fools Day 2009,
 traffic, particularly price sensitive passengers have declined at Shannon.
 Ryanair, which had based 6 aircraft (an investment of over $400m) in Shannon
 last winter, reduced this to 4 aircraft in summer 2009 and is reducing the base
 further to three aircraft in Winter 2009/10 as the Government's EUR10 tourist tax
 continues to devastate traffic and visitor numbers at all Irish airports and
 Shannon in particular.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair and Shannon Discuss 75% Cuts at Base
Ryanair has written to Shannon Airport confirming that it has lost money in each
 of the 5 years it has operated a base at Shannon Airport. Nevertheless Ryanair
 has confirmed that it is willing to continue to base aircraft and deliver
 substantial passenger numbers and jobs at Shannon if the EUR10 tourist tax is
 removed on or before 1st February 2010 and if Shannon Airport extends Ryanair's
 cost base on a competitive basis for a further 5 year period.  Ryanair is
 seeking a 50% reduction in its costs at Shannon, which would reflect the 70%
 decline in average fares which Ryanair has suffered at Shannon over the past 5
 years.
If the Government EUR10 travel tax is removed at Shannon, then Ryanair will commit
 to delivering more than 1.2m passengers annually, on up to 4 based aircraft and
 200 Ryanair jobs being maintained at the airport. However, if the Shannon cost
 base is not extended, or if the Government's EUR10 tourist tax is not removed,
 then Ryanair will reduce its Shannon base by 75% to 1 based aircraft, which will
 largely operate the London and some UK provincial routes, guaranteeing just 50
 jobs, and 300,000 passengers p.a.
Ryanair's Michael Cawley said:
"We call again on the Irish Government to scrap this stupid and damaging EUR10
 tourist tax. Since its introduction, traffic at the Irish airports has fallen by
 more than 15%, at a time when Ryanair is growing by almost 1 million passengers
 each month. All of Ryanair's and Aer Lingus' traffic growth is now taking place
 outside of Ireland because of the impact of the DAA's high costs and the
 Government's tourist tax.
"The Belgian and Dutch Government's have already realised the damage that these
 tourist taxes cause and have scrapped them. Similarly the Greek and Spanish
 Governments have reduced their airport charges, in some cases to zero, in order
 to reverse traffic and tourism declines during the current recession. The Irish
 Government and its inefficient airport monopoly the DAA must follow suit. It's
 time to lower airport charges and axe the tourist tax, before this Government
 turns away even more passengers, tourists and jobs at Shannon and the other
 Irish international airports".

 CSO confirms slump in visitors since Irish Govt EUR10 tourist tax introduced
 Ryanair calls on Govt to axe the EUR10 tourist tax
Ryanair, the World's favourite airline, today (15th Oct 09) welcomed the CSO
 traffic figures which confirm that 123,000 (13%) fewer visitors travelled to
 Ireland in August as the Govt's EUR10 tourist tax devastates Irish tourism, even
 during the summer peak. Ryanair's August traffic grew by 19%, over 1.1m new
 passengers, which disproves the Govt's false claim that this decline is due to
 the recession.

Ryanair warned that unless the Irish Government's EUR10 tourist tax is scrapped,
Ryanair Holdings PLC Tourist Tax - CSO Confirms Drop in Figures
 then the fall in Irish visitor numbers will worsen during winter, as more
 flights, routes and services are cut from the Government's high cost Dublin,
 Cork and Shannon Airports.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
"CSO figures show a 13% drop in visitor numbers in August and 11% for the year
 to date. The loss of 600,000 visitors so far this year confirms that the
 collapse in Irish tourism is accelerating as the EUR10 tourist tax makes Ireland
 an uncompetitive tourist destination.
"In recent months the Belgian, Dutch, Greek and Spanish governments have all
 scrapped tourist taxes and/or reduced airport charges, in some cases to zero, in
 order to stimulate tourism. Ryanair has expanded in these countries including
 our recent announcement of 43 new routes to/from Spain this winter.  The Irish
 Government cannot grow Irish tourism by taxing it.  We must axe this stupid EUR10
 tourist tax and start welcoming visitors, not taxing them".

 Jupiter European Opportunities Trust PLC
Interim Management Review for the three months ended 31 August 2009
The Board of Jupiter European Opportunities Trust PLC (the "Company")
 is pleased to announce its interim management review for the  quarter
 ended 31 August 2009.
During the period from 1 June  2009 to 31 August 2009, the  Company's
 net asset value per share excluding income and expenses rose by  14.2
 per cent. to 185.40p,  which compares with a  rise of 15.3 per  cent.
 for the Company's benchmark, the FTSE World Europe ex UK Total Return
 Index, over the same period.
Since 31  August  2009  the  Company's  net  asset  value  per  share
 excluding income and expenses has risen by a further 9.8 per cent. to
 203.49p as at 29th September 2009, which compares with a rise of  7.8
 per cent.  for the  Company's benchmark  over the  same period.   The
 Company's middle market  share price  as at 29th  September 2009  was
 177.0p which represents a  13.0 per cent. discount  to its net  asset
 value on that date.
Investment Manager's Report for the Quarter Ended 31 August 2009
Equity markets continued to rally over the summer led by cyclicals.
 Results from the start of the second quarter reporting season proved
 better than expected. Investors reacted positively to news that
 companies had been vigorous in their cost-cutting programmes.
Jupiter Euro OppsTst Interim Management Statement
 However, for many companies there were still few signs of top line
 sales growth, while outlook statements remained brief and
 non-committal.
Neopost, the postal services group, confirmed its resilient business
 model and reported second quarter sales up almost 4 per cent. and
 higher recurring revenues across all regions. Vopak, the global
 leader in tank storage services for chemical and oil industries,
 issued a strong trading update reflecting the increasing resilience
 of this business.
Shares in Reed Elsevier dipped slightly after new management gave
 itself some headroom for future investment via a modest rights issue
 to reduce debt. This rather overshadowed the half yearly results
 which were better than expected.
In July we bought into Aixtron. This electronic component maker
 expects strong order growth across Asia driven by demand for the
 light emitting diodes used in flat screen televisions. We also opened
 a small position in Ryanair. The low cost airline should be a major
 beneficiary of the potential failures and cutbacks of other carriers
 this winter.
We added to our position in Oriflame, which reported second quarter
 results broadly in line with consensus. This Swedish cosmetics group
 operates in 60 countries using a direct sales force. Cosmetics have
 historically been very resilient during recessions, where women
 consumers continue to spend on make-up while cutting down on big
 ticket items. They do, however, trade down to lower-end cosmetics.
 This should benefit Oriflame which is positioned in the middle-market
 but has a very strong brand name. The use of part-time sales agents
 makes the cost base flexible. We believe Oriflame shows
 contra-cyclical elements in its top line, where periods of economic
 weakness increase the inflow of consultants.
We top sliced our position in Norwegian bank Den Norske Bank as the
 shares continued to rally along with other financials. We took
 profits and sold out of KWS Saat. The shares had performed strongly
 on expectations that higher sugar prices would increase demand for
 the company's sugar beet seeds.
The global economy appears to be recovering from recession but the
 crisis is not yet over. Major economic imbalances still need to be
 corrected while the possibility of an escalation in protectionist
 measures should not be ruled out.

OBJECTIVE OF THE COMPANY
The objective of the Company is  to invest in securities of  European
 companies and in sectors or  geographical areas which are  considered
 by the investment manager to offer good prospects for capital growth,
 taking into account economic trends and business development.
INVESTMENT POLICY
The Investment Manager adopts a stock picking approach in the  belief
 that a thorough analysis and understanding  of a company is the  best
 way  to  identify   long-term  superior   earnings  prospects.   This
 understanding begins  with  identifying  those  companies  where  the
 ownership structure  and incumbent  management are  conducive to  the
 realisation of  the  aim  of achieving  superior  long-term  earnings
 growth. The Investment Manager will seek to identify companies  which
 enjoy certain key business characteristics  including some or all  of
 the following:
_ a strong management  record and team, and  the confidence that  the
 Investment Manager has  in that management's  ability to explain  and
 account for its actions;
_  proprietary  technology  and   other  factors  which  indicate   a
 sustainable competitive advantage;
_ a reasonable  expectation that  demand for  companies' products  or
 services will enhance long-term growth; and
_ an understanding that structural changes are likely to benefit that
 company's prospects rather than have a negative impact on them.
It is intended that  the Company will have  some exposure to most  of
 the major  sectors of  the European  economy.  There  may be  sectors
 which do not enjoy the  business characteristics described above  and
 in such circumstances  the Investment Manager  will seek to  identify
 companies that  are expected  to  generate superior  earnings  growth
 within that sector.
In analysing  potential  investments,  the  Investment  Manager  will
 employ differing valuation techniques depending on their relevance to
 the business characteristics  of a particular  company. However,  the
 underlying feature  will be  the sustainability  and growth  of  free
 cash-flow in the long-term.
Material Events
On 18  August 2009  the  board announced  the  payment of  a  special
 interim dividend  of 0.85p  (net) per  Ordinary share  payable on  25
 September 2009  to shareholders  who  appear on  the register  on  28
Jupiter Euro OppsTst Interim Management Statement
 August 2009.
This special interim dividend  is being paid in  order to ensure  the
 Company's continuing  status  with  HM  Revenue  and  Customs  as  an
 investment trust.  Section  842 of the  Income and Corporation  Taxes
 Act 1988 prohibits the Company from retaining more than 15 per  cent.
 of its  eligible investment  income from  one financial  year to  the
 next.
The Directors stated dividend policy is to manage the Company's
 affairs in order to achieve shareholder returns through capital
 growth rather than through the generation of income. It is therefore
 not expected that the Company will pay a regular dividend in future
 financial years.

Monthly fact sheets for the  Company are available for download  from
 www.jupiteronline.co.uk and  by  post  or fax  on  request  from  the
 company secretarial department.

 GOVERNMENT SHOULD EXPLAIN WHY IT REJECTED RYANAIR'S DEC 2008 OFFER,
 WHICH WOULD HAVE CREATED 1,000 NEW JOBS IN AER LINGUS,
 WHEN YESTERDAY THEY ANNOUNCE 670 JOB LOSSES
Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline today (Thursday, 8th October 2009) called
 on the Department of Transport, to explain why it rejected Ryanair's December
 2008 offer for Aer Lingus, which guaranteed to double the size of Aer Lingus'
 short-haul fleet and create 1,000 new jobs in the airline over a 5 year period,
 when yesterday the Board of Aer Lingus, which is controlled by the Irish
 Government and the trade unions announced 670 jobs losses, as well as pay and
 pension cuts in Aer Lingus.
Ryanair's Dec 2008 offer document for Aer Lingus guaranteed to double Aer
 Lingus' short-haul fleet from 30 to over 60 aircraft, create 1,000 new jobs for
 pilots, cabin crew and engineers over a 5 year period, while at the same time
 reducing Aer Lingus' fares, removing its fuel surcharges, securing its brand,
 Heathrow slots and connectivity.
Ryanair's offer would also have provided Aer Lingus with a strong financial
 partner, at a time when all other airlines across Europe are collapsing or
 consolidating into one of the big four European airlines led by Air France, BA,
Ryanair Holdings PLC Response to Aer Lingus Announcement
 Lufthansa and Ryanair.
Since the Minister for Transport rejected Ryanair's Dec 2008 offer, Aer Lingus
 has:
*  Announced record losses of over EUR100m for 2008.
 *  Guided increased losses in 2009.
 *  Seen its long-haul traffic collapse.
 *  Seen its net cash balances fall from over EUR800m, to less than EUR400m.
 *  Yesterday announced over 670 jobs losses, and pay and pension cuts.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"Yesterday's announcement of widespread job losses and pay cuts in Aer Lingus is
 further evidence of the incompetence of Ireland's Department of Transport. Since
 they rejected Ryanair's second offer for Aer Lingus last January, the Irish
 Government and the trade unions have controlled the Board of Aer Lingus and have
 spectacularly mismanaged it. Aer Lingus' share price has collapsed, its losses
 have exploded, its transatlantic business is in freefall and now they have
 announced over 670 job losses, together with pay and pension cuts, when just 10
 months ago they rejected  an offer of guaranteed investment, growth and 1,000
 new jobs in Aer Lingus.
"The Department of Transport should now explain to Aer Lingus shareholders, and
 the 670 Aer Lingus workers who are facing redundancy why they rejected an offer
 from the world's largest international airline, which would have doubled the
 size of the short-haul fleet  and created up to 1,000 new jobs at the airline,
 while securing  the future of Aer Lingus, its brand, and its connectivity. The
 sooner the dead hand of the Department of Transport and its corrupt Civil
 Service is removed from the transport sector in Ireland, the better it will
 function in the interests of consumers.
"Ryanair believes there is a bright future for Aer Lingus, but it will never be
 achieved while it is mismanaged by a bunch of political and trade union hacks on
 the Aer Lingus Board".

 GARTMORE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES plc
Interim Management Statement (unaudited)
In the quarter to 30 September 2009 the Company's Net Asset Value per Ordinary
 share increased by 23.6% to 507.94 pence per share. The benchmark FTSE SmallCap
 (ex investment companies) Index increased 34.0%.
Market Environment
Cyclical companies maintained their momentum as recovery-focused sentiment
 continued to dominate market movements despite weaker-than-expected data on
 several fronts. Share price increases were most aggressive in the real estate
 sector, where the Company's portfolio is underweight compared with the
 benchmark, but also very strong in businesses geared to an economic recovery.
 Business confidence rose sharply and second quarter GDP was revised upwards in
 August. However, the release of the minutes from the August meeting of the Bank
 of England's monetary policy committee showed that the optimism of investors
 was not shared by the MPC, with an extension of the quantitative easing program
 going against market expectations. Overall returns in the main market were
 amongst the highest recorded in a quarter.
Investment Strategy
Positive contributors to the September quarter performance included Jarvis,
Gartmore Growth Opps Interim Management Statement
 Sterling Energy and Morse. Rail contractor Jarvis delivered extraordinary gains
 in July despite posting a loss of GBP6.3m for its 2008/09 financial year. The
 company expects trading conditions beyond 2010 to improve considerably and that
 conviction was supported by both the incoming Chief Executive and Chairman
 purchasing shares during July.
Oil & gas producer Sterling Energy performed very well in the quarter.
 Sterling's competitor Gulf Keystone announced it had made a significant oil
 discovery in a region of Iraq where Sterling also has exploration assets.
 Sterling, which has interests in the Gulf of Mexico, Africa and the Middle
 East, also completed a share placing in September. With the business now
 well-funded to fulfil exploration activities under its new management team, the
 share price has recovered.
The share price of technology company Morse more than doubled over July
 following a positive earnings update and a preliminary take-over approach. The
 share price fell back slightly after the take-over talks ended in August, but
 has since recovered. We believe that the company remains undervalued at current
 prices.
Penna Consulting has also been performing well, building on the gains from an
 acquisition late in the second quarter of 2009.
Detractors from performance in the quarter included our large holding in Pace.
 Although the share price increased, it underperformed the benchmark index. Our
 holding in Gresham Computing also detracted after falling by over a third and
 Dart Group fell sharply during August on the news that Ryanair will be opening
 a new base at Leeds Bradford Airport, the home of Dart's airline Jet2. The
 additional competition, with the added pressure of facing Ryanair's aggressive
 pricing policies, led to a downgrade from one broker.
The portfolio remains positioned in small and micro-cap stocks where the
 Manager believes opportunities are the greatest. Although year-to-date returns
 remain excellent in this quarter some micro-cap share price moves were rather
 less than the market overall.
Investment Outlook
We believe that, despite the market increases in recent months, many of our
 positions have not yet received market recognition for their potential.
 Secondly, capital remains a scarce resource in our area of specialism and
 competence, providing us with new opportunities. We continue to introduce new
 names and identify opportunities to facilitate a scale of change in small
 businesses where we believe they offer commensurate returns.

 RYANAIR CALLS ON AER LINGUS TO END FREE FLIGHTS FOR FORMER DIRECTORS AND OTHERS
 TO REDUCE COSTS
Ryanair, the world's favourite airline today (6 Oct 09) wrote to Aer Lingus
 Chairman, Colm Barrington to request a full list of all those (non current
 employees and Board members) who are entitled to free flights on Aer Lingus.
 Ryanair, in common with many other shareholders believes that these free flight
 deals for former Directors (like Sean Fitzpatrick) and others are inappropriate
 and unjustifiable at a time when Aer Lingus is losing over EUR100m per year and
 considering "amputation, not cosmetic cuts".
Ryanair has asked Mr Barrington to confirm what other categories/groups/persons
 are entitled to free flights on Aer Lingus and specifically whether any of the
 following groups are entitled to free flights on Aer Lingus:
1.  Former Board members, advisors and employees of Aer Lingus
 2.  Current or former employees/Directors of the DAA or other Irish Semi State
 companies.
 3.  Current or former Taoisigh, Government Ministers, or politicians.

Ryanair Holdings PLC Statement re: Aer Lingus Free Flights to Directors
 6.  Current or former Journalists.
Ryanair has called on Aer Lingus to publish the details of those categories or
 groups of non employees who have an entitlement to free flights on Aer Lingus
 and to explain why this entitlement exists.Ryanair is calling on the Board of
 Aer Lingus to immediately end these free flight schemes which are an unjustified
 cost and waste at a time when Aer Lingus is losing money and considering
 substantial job cuts.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
"It is entirely wrong for Aer Lingus to be giving free flights entitlements to
 former Board Directors, including political appointees and possibly others at a
 time when the airline is losing money, is considering widespread job and pay
 cuts and is running down its cash balances at an alarming rate.
"Ryanair like all other Aer Lingus shareholders is concerned to ensure that the
 Board of Aer Lingus tackles its bloated cost base, and eliminates unnecessary
 cost and waste such as free flights for non employees such as Mr Fitzpatrick and
 any other political appointees to the Board of Aer Lingus at a time when the
 airline is losing money and cutting jobs."

Dear Colm,
Like all other Aer Lingus shareholders, Ryanair is deeply disturbed to read
 about the ridiculous free flights entitlements which Aer Lingus allocates to
 former Board Directors and possibly others. While there may be some
 justification for offering serving Directors free air travel during their tenure
 on the Board, there is no justification for a loss making airline to extend this
 privilege (and substantial cost) to people who have retired/resigned and are no
 longer making any contribution to the company.
This waste is remarkable, at a time when Aer Lingus claims to be considering
 "amputation rather than cosmetic cuts" and will shortly announce hundreds of job
Ryanair Holdings PLC Statement re: Aer Lingus Free Flights to Directors
 losses. Why has the Board of Aer Lingus not eliminated these free flight
 entitlements to anyone other than current employees and Board members. Free
 flight concessions should be one of the first areas of cost that your Board
 should tackle, particularly as you continue to preside over record losses at Aer
 Lingus.
Please provide us with a list of all persons, groups and organisations (who are
 not fulltime employees or Board members of Aer Lingus) who are currently
 entitled to free and/or discounted flights on Aer Lingus services from 1 Jan
 2008 to date.
More particularly please confirm whether any members of the following groups
 qualify for free or discounted Aer Lingus flights and the cost of all of these
 flights in 2008? Please explain why these entitlements have not been withdrawn
 by the Board as a cost saving and loss reduction measure;
1.  Former Board members, advisors, employees.
 2.  Current or former employees or directors of the DAA and any other State
 companies.
 3.  Current or former politicians including former Ministers and former Taoisigh.
 4.  Current or former Civil Servants.
 5.  Current or former Trade Union officials.
 6.  Current or former Journalists.
We look forward to receiving this information as a matter of urgency. It is
 particularly important to shareholders, given the scale of Aer Lingus'
 continuing losses that you publish details of all such unnecessary free and/or
 discounted flight deals and that the Board puts an end to these useless and
 unnecessary privileges in order to reduce costs and reduce Aer Lingus' losses.
Yours sincerely
Michael O'Leary
 Chief Executive

Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
 "Ryanair carried three times British Airways UK/ Europe passengers, and more

 more international passengers than any other airline, making Ryanair the World's

 RYANAIR POSITION REGARDING AER LINGUS
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary today (Monday, 5th October 2009) confirmed that there
 was 'no substance' to reports which appeared on FT.com claiming that Ryanair
 could take control to Aer Lingus through a Rights Issue.
"Our position on Aer Lingus was recently confirmed at the Ryanair AGM, which is
 that we are "highly unlikely" to make a third offer. Aer Lingus would now be
 profitable, growing and creating new jobs if the Irish Government had accepted
 either of Ryanair's two previous offers instead of which sadly Aer Lingus is
 suffering record losses and will shortly announce a huge redundancy programme as
 it continues to be mismanaged and controlled by its Government and trade union
 appointed Board", said Mr O'Leary.

Prime Minister SÓcrates LAUnCHES Ryanair's NEW PORTO BASE
3 aircraft, 22 routes and 2M passengerS P.A.
Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, today (Thursday, 3rd September 2009)
 celebrated the official opening of its first base in Portugal by Prime Minister,
 Mr. José Socrates. Ryanair's Porto base, its 33rd in Europe, will operate with
 three based aircraft, 22 routes and deliver 2m passengers p.a. which will
 sustain 2,000 local jobs at Porto Airport.
Prime Minister Sócrates joined Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, in urging all Irish
 voters to say 'Yes to Europe' in the referendum on October 2nd next.  Ryanair
 said that its growth from small regional Irish airline to the Europe's largest
 scheduled carrier and the creation of over 6,500 well paid jobs would not have
 been possible without the de-regulation of the airline industry by the European
 Union in 1997.
Ryanair celebrated the launch of its Porto base, by releasing 1 million FREE
 seats for travel across its European network in October and November, which are
 available for booking on www.ryanair.com until midnight Sunday (6th Sept).
Ryanair Holdings PLC Prime Minister Socrates Launches New Porto Base
In Porto, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"Ryanair is honoured that Prime Minister Sócrates has joined us to officially
 open our Porto base, which is our first in Portugal and our 33rd in Europe.
 Ryanair's 2m passengers p.a. in Porto will help to create and sustain 2,000
 local jobs. This new base demonstrates the opportunities that EU membership has
 delivered for Irish companies operating across Europe. Ryanair has become
 Europe's largest airline thanks to the de-regulation of the industry by the EU.
 A strong Europe allows small companies in countries like Ireland and Portugal to
 become world beaters, this is why I am again urging all Irish voters to say 'Sim
 à Europa' ('Yes to Europe')  on October 2nd next."
Prime Minister, José Sócrates said:
"The Portuguese Government made efforts to attract low cost airlines bringing
 new routes to obtain more tourists from more origins, contributing to economic
 development, more investments and employment. This operational base now confirms
 Porto and Northern Portugal as an even greater tourist destination, but will
 also strengthen the central role of Porto in the North-West of the Iberian
 Peninsula. The launch of this base is also a proof of confidence in the
 Portuguese economy and the recognition of the quality of our infrastructures and
 particularly in the Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport. Only the existence of a
 modern and efficient airport allowed Ryanair to install one of their operational
 bases in Portugal, which will have a significant economic impact in this region
 of the country."

 RYANAIR LAUNCHES SKYEUROPE RESCUE FARE
Ryanair, the World's favourite airline, today (1st Sept), launched a EUR25 (one
 way including taxes and charges) rescue fare* for SkyEurope passengers who may
 have been left stranded or have had their travel plans disrupted by the
 bankruptcy of the airline yesterday. This fare applies to Bratislava flights
 to/from Alicante, Barcelona (Girona), Brussels (Charleroi), Rome (Ciampino),
 Liverpool and London (Stansted).
Ryanair also pledged to assist with the repatriation of passengers who may be
 caught up in any future airline collapse and advised passengers that the best
 way to ensure travel plans are protected is to travel only with financially
 secure airlines such as Ryanair.
Ryanair's rescue fare can be booked via
 www.ryanair.com/member/SkyEuroperescuefare.html until 15th September for travel
 until 17th December, and applies to SkyEurope passengers only.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
"SkyEurope's failure underlines the risk of flying with an airline that is not
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Launches SkyEurope Rescue Fare
 financially stable.  Ryanair will help stranded passengers return home and
 ensure that those with travel plans up to 17thDecember can still travel.
Ryanair has the biggest route network in Europe making it easier for stranded
 SkyEurope passengers to find a local airport and return home.  SkyEurope
 passengers can book these rescue fares for only EUR25 including taxes and charges
 via www.ryanair.com until 15th September.
"Ryanair strongly advises all passengers to book airfares only with financially
 stable airlines.  By booking with Ryanair you will secure the guaranteed lowest
 fares and no fuel surcharges and can be sure that Ryanair will still be flying
 when your flight date arrives.  With over EUR2billion in cash reserves Ryanair is
 one of the most financially robust airlines in Europe".

 RYANAIR STATEMENT ON AER LINGUS RESULTS
IRISH STOCK EXCHANGE AND IRISH TAKEOVER PANEL SHOULD EXPLAIN WHY THEY ALLOWED
 AER LINGUS TO MISLEAD SHAREHOLDERS AND THE MARKETS IN THEIR DECEMBER 2008
 DEFENCE DOCUMENT
Ryanair, Ireland's favourite and largest airline, today (Thursday, 27 August
 2009) called on the Irish Stock Exchange and the Irish Takeover Panel to explain
 why they allowed the Board of Aer Lingus to mislead shareholders and the markets
 when they published their defence document on 22nd December 2008 - just 8 months
 ago.  Today's announcement by Aer Lingus of half year operating losses of EUR93m
 and the collapse of its net cash balances to EUR440m exposes the fact that Aer
 Lingus shareholders and the markets were misled by the Board of Aer Lingus in
 this Dec'08 Defence Document.
In Aer Lingus' Defence Document, Chairman, Mr Colm Barrington, made the
 following false claims to shareholders:
1."Despite these extremely challenging conditions, we expect to achieve profit
 overall in
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR STATEMENT ON AER LINGUS RESULTS
2008 ".
- Aer Lingus reported an after tax
 loss of EUR108m for 2008.
2."We expect that significantly reduced fuel prices and a number of management
 cost
reduction initiatives will enable Aer Lingus to continue to
 enhance profitability in
2009 and beyond".
 - Aer Lingus' H1 2009 losses have risen to EUR93m and it now refuses to give any
 guidance on the extent of its substantial losses for 2009.
3."Aer Lingus is and will be profitable"
 - 8 months later Aer Lingus has
 confirmed that it has and will continue to be loss making.
4."Our long-haul business also continues to grow".
 - Aer Lingus' long-haul
 traffic has declined by 12% in H1 2009.
Ryanair has previously submitted complaints to the Irish Stock Exchange, the
 Irish Takeover Panel and the Financial Services Regulator about these materially
 false Aer Lingus claims. To date no action has been taken by any of these
 regulatory agencies. Ryanair believes that Aer Lingus shareholders are entitled
 to know why a Ryanair offer of EUR1.40 per share was rejected by the Board of Aer
 Lingus just 8 months ago, on the basis of patently false claims about growth and
 profitability. Shareholders in Irish plc's are entitled to expect that the Irish
 Regulatory Authorities  (the Stock Exchange, the Takeover Panel and the FSR)
 will ensure that plc's like Aer Lingus  make accurate claims about growth and
 profitability, particularly during takeovers.
Ryanair calls on the Irish Stock Exchange and the Takeover Panel to explain why
 they failed to take any action about these patently false claims during the 7
 months since this takeover was withdrawn.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"Today's results from Aer Lingus prove conclusively that Chairman, Mr Colm
 Barrington, and the Board of Aer Lingus misled shareholders and the Stock
 Exchange in their Dec'08 Defence Document published just 8 months ago.
"I believe Aer Lingus' shareholders, who have now suffered further catastrophic
 losses, as the Aer Lingus share price has collapsed from over EUR1.40 to less than
 EUR0.50 are entitled to an explanation from the Irish Stock Exchange and the Irish
 Takeover Panel as to what action they have taken about these false Aer Lingus
 claims and why the regulatory authorities of Ireland were asleep on the job,
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR STATEMENT ON AER LINGUS RESULTS
 while the Board of Aer Lingus was misleading shareholders and the markets in
 December 2008.
"Is it any wonder that the reputation of the Irish Stock Exchange has suffered
 in recent months, when the regulatory authorities are so clearly unfit for
 purpose and unwilling to implement their own rules on truthfulness and accuracy
 on company announcements during contested takeovers".

 4 GERMAN INTERNET SCREENSCRAPERS AGREE to Stop SELLING RYANAIR FLIGHTS
Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (14th Aug 09) confirmed that 4 more
 German screenscraper ticket-tout websites (travelgreen.de, titanic.de,
 flycall.de and atr24.de) have signed legally binding declarations to stop
 scraping Ryanair's website and selling Ryanair's flights (at inflated prices) to
 German consumers. These are the latest of a growing number of screenscraper
 websites all over Europe that wisely chose to stop misleading consumers and
 avoid court proceedings in Ireland.Ryanair has launched proceedings in the
 Dublin High Court against other screenscrapers (including traveltopia,
 airlinedirect, billigflug) who continue to blatantly ignore consumer rights, and
 who remain in breach of Ryanair.com Terms of Use and property rights.
Screenscraping involves gaining unauthorised access to the Ryanair website and
 mis-selling of flights to consumers with exorbitant charges and mark-ups which
 are hidden from consumers.  Following the May 2009 decision of the Hamburg
 courts that screenscraping to resell Ryanair's flights is unlawful, Ryanair
 continues to pursue screenscraper websites in the courts in Ireland.
In the interest of consumers Ryanair allows "price comparison only" websites to
Ryanair Holdings PLC 4 German Websites Agree to Stop Screenscraping
 access its timetable and pricing information, for an annual charitable donation
 of EUR100, in order to compare Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares with those of
 high fare, fuel surcharging airlines. Ryanair's licence agreement is open to all
 genuine "price comparison only" websites and already many have signed up.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
"These legal commitments by screenscraping websites are the latest positive
 development in Ryanair's relentless pro-consumer campaign against internet
 ticket-touts.  Genuine price comparison websites can enter into a licence
 agreement with Ryanair, for a charitable donation of just EUR100, which will allow
 them to provide consumers with legitimate price comparison.  However, Ryanair
 will not allow consumers to be subjected to sneaky hidden charges by
 unauthorised screenscraping ticket-touts.
"We are confident that through Ryanair's sustained pressure and with the
 assistance of European consumer agencies, unauthorised screenscraping and
 overcharging of consumers will eventually be outlawed throughout Europe, to the
 benefit of consumers and legitimate businesses".

John Parkin, LBIA Chief Executive, said:
"This is a great vote of confidence in the potential of both the airport
 and our region from Europe's largest airline. Today's announcement makes us an
 exception in the sector and will help create much needed jobs. It shows Ryanair
 shares our confidence in the tremendous opportunity for strong market growth at
 the airport. Significantly it follows recent planning approval for the terminal
 development to deliver best in class facilities and build upon existing routes".

 RYANAIR WELCOMES BALPA'S CONFIRMATION THAT ITS RECOGNITION CAMPAIGN AMONG
 RYANAIR'S UK PILOTS HAS FAILED - AGAIN (SO IT'S BYE BYE BALPA)
Ryanair, the UK's largest airline today (7th Aug 09) welcomed BALPA's recent
 announcement that it has "temporarily suspended" its trade recognition campaign
 amongst Ryanair's UK pilots in the face of massive opposition from Ryanair's
 pilots towards BALPA (the British Airways Lunching Pilots Association).
On June 19th BALPA wrote to Ryanair seeking to impose union recognition among
 Ryanair's UK pilots. Ryanair told them to go away, because Ryanair's pilots
 continue to negotiate directly with the airline as evidenced by a recent
 extension of Ryanair's UK pilots four year pay and conditions agreement. This
 guaranteed Ryanair pilots a 5 on, 4 off roster (the best in the industry) as
 well as protecting Ryanair's pilots pay and job security at a time when BALPA
 was negotiating pay cuts and job cuts at British Airways, Virgin, Thompson-Fly
 and others.
However BALPA wouldn't take the hint and threatened to refer the matter to the
 CAC, who could (under UK legislation) require a secret ballot among Ryanair UK
 pilots to see whether they actually want trade union recognition. Following a
 groundswell of opposition to BALPA from Ryanair's UK pilots, BALPA have now
Ryanair Holdings PLC BALPA Confirms Recognition Campaign has Failed
 recognised that they don't have the support of a majority of Ryanair's pilots,
 that they won't win any such ballot, which is why their campaign to impose union
 recognition has now been "temporarily suspended" in another humiliating defeat
 for the British Airways Lunching Pilots Association.
Ryanair's Director of Personnel, Eddie Wilson said:
"The only reason why BALPA is "temporarily suspending" this campaign is because
 they know that they will lose. BALPA don't want to lose another secret ballot on
 recognition, because that will mean they can't have another go at Ryanair for a
 minimum period of three years.
"Perhaps now would be a good time for BALPA - the British Airways Lunching
 Pilots Association - to accept that Ryanair's UK pilots have better pay, better
 terms and conditions and better rosters than the pay cuts and job losses being
 negotiated by BALPA at many other British airlines. This is why Ryanair's UK
 pilots don't need and don't want the "help" of a failed BA pilots union, which
 last year spent four times more on lunches, conferences, entertainment  and
 travel (GBP886,000) than they did on legal fees defending their members
 (GBP191,000).
"This is another humiliating defeat for the British Airways Lunching Pilots
 Association, coming 8 years after they lost the last secret ballot on trade
 union recognition by a majority of over 4 to 1 against. At least this latest
 failure of BALPA's recognition campaign will give them more time for lunches,
 and they can spend even less money defending their members interests in British
 Airways, Virgin, Thomson-Fly and all the other UK airlines where BALPA are
 negotiating pay cuts and job cuts.  So it's Bye Bye BALPA - yet again!!"

 CSO confirms continuing slump in visitor figures since Irish Government's EUR10
 tourist tax introduced
 Ryanair calls on Government to scrap EUR10 tourist tax now
Ryanair, the World's favourite airline, today (6th Aug 09) welcomed the CSO June
 traffic figures which confirm that 114,000 (15%) fewer visitors travelled to
 Ireland in June as the Government's EUR10 tourist tax continues to devastate Irish
 tourism. Ryanair's traffic in June grew by 13%, more than 670,000 new
 passengers, which disproves the Governments false claim that that this decline
 is due to the recession.
Ryanair warned that unless the Irish Government's EUR10 tourist tax is scrapped,
 then the fall in Irish visitor numbers will worsen next winter, as more flights,
 routes and services are cut from Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports.
Ryanair's Daniel de Carvalho said:
"CSO figures show a 15% drop in visitor numbers in June. The loss of these
 114,000 visitors confirms that the collapse in Irish tourism is accelerating as
 the Irish Government's EUR10 tourist tax makes Ireland an uncompetitive tourist
 market.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Calls on Irish Govt. to Scrap Tourist Tax
"In recent months the Belgian, Dutch, Greek and Spanish governments have all
 scrapped tourist taxes and/or reduced airport charges to zero in order to
 stimulate tourism. Ryanair has expanded in these countries including our recent
 announcement of 43 new routes to/from Spain this winter.The Irish Government
 cannot grow Irish tourism by taxing it. We must scrap this stupid EUR10 tourist
 tax and start welcoming visitors, not taxing them".

RYANAIR'S TRAFFIC GROWS 19% IN JULY
Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, today (5 Aug 09) announced that its
 passenger traffic grew by 19% in July 2009 to 6.7m passengers which is a new
 monthly traffic record for Europe's largest low fares airline.
 Ryanair's continued growth underlines that passengers during this recession are
 increasingly switching from high fare, fuel surcharging flag carriers, such as
 Air France, BA, Lufthansa and Aer Lingus who are losing passengers to Ryanair's
 lowest fares and no fuel surcharge guarantee.
 The following are Ryanair's traffic and load factor stats for July 2009.

 Ryanair's lowest fares and no fuel surcharge guarantee over the high fares and

 carries almost three times BA's worldwide recent traffic which clearly makes
 Ryanair "the world's favourite airline".

RYANAIR ANNOUNCES $1.6BN AIRCRAFT FINANCING AGREEMENT
 FOR 55 NEW AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES
Ryanair, the world's favourite airline today (31 July 09) announced that it has
 awarded mandates to a syndicate of banks for approximately $1.6bn of financing
 for 55 aircraft delivering between November 2009 and October 2010. The syndicate
 of banks is comprised of BNP Paribas, Calyon, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
 Corporation. The banks have been mandated to act as joint arrangers for
 Ryanair's US Ex-Im Bank Euro dominated export credit facility. Calyon have
 underwritten 25 aircraft and BNP Paribas and SMBC have each underwritten 15
 aircraft.
Commenting on this financing, CFO Howard Millar said:
"Ryanair is pleased to announce the agreement for approximately $1.6bn of
 underwritten funding for 55 aircraft to be delivered between November 2009 and
 October 2010 with our partners BNP Paribas, Calyon and SMBC. It is testimony to
 the financial strength of Ryanair and the standing of our partners BNP Paribas,
 Calyon and SMBC that we have been able to complete a facility of this size in
 the current challenging financial markets. The securing of this facility will

 enable Ryanair to continue to grow its business and bring more competition,
 choice, and lower fares to consumers in Europe".
Commenting on this financing, Eric Eugène, Global Head of Transportation
 Group BNP Paribas, José Abramovici, Global Head of Aviation Group & Rail Finance
 Calyon and Craig Macdonald, Head of Aircraft Finance SMBC, collectively said:
"The Banks were most pleased to jointly support the financing of 55 B737-800
 aircraft for one of the leading European carriers. Ryanair has once again proven
 to be cost efficient not only in its operations, its aircraft purchasing, but
 also in negotiating the terms and conditions of its jumbo 55 aircraft financing
 in an unprecedented period of scarce liquidity from the aviation banking
 universe".

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES 20% FLIGHT CUTS AT DUBLIN AIRPORT FOR WINTER 2009
Ryanair, the World's favourite airline, today (30 July 09) announced 20% flight
 cuts at its Dublin base for the coming winter schedule (09/10). Compared to
 winter 2008/09, when Ryanair based 18 aircraft, and operated 1,200 weekly
 flights, Ryanair's Dublin schedule this winter will be cut by 22% to 14 based
 aircraft with 20% fewer flights at less than 1,000 each week.  Ryanair estimates
 that its Dublin traffic this winter will decline by a further 250,000 passengers
 compared to last winter's figures, as Dublin Airport loses over 2m passengers
 overall in 2009.
Ryanair's decision to cut based aircraft flights at Dublin Airport is for the
 following reasons:
*  Dublin is one of Ryanair's two most expensive base airports (Stansted is the
 other).
 *  Costs at the DAA monopoly continue to increase at above inflation rates.
 *  The Aviation Regulator continues to rubber stamp unjustified Dublin Airport cost
 increases while costs at most other UK and European airports are falling.
 *  The Irish Govts EUR10 tourist tax makes Ireland an uncompetitive tourist
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces 20% Flight Cuts
 destination at a time when other European Governments have scrapped their
 tourist taxes.
 *  Traffic at Dublin airport is collapsing (down 11% or 1m fewer pax in the first
 half of 2009) under the weight of these high airport fees and this stupid
 tourist tax.
The fact that the DAA monopoly are proposing further price increases at a time
 when most other UK and European airports are reducing their prices, highlights
 the damage being done to Irish aviation and tourism by this high cost,
 inefficient, badly run airport monopoly. Ryanair has repeatedly called on the
 Government to scrap the EUR10 tourist tax which has had an equally devastating
 impact on Irish tourism. Ireland cannot grow tourism by taxing tourists.  The
 Belgian and Dutch Governments have recently scrapped their tourist taxes, and
 the Spanish and Greek Governments have reduced their airport fees in some cases
 to zero this winter in order to reverse traffic declines.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said today:
"In winter 2007 Ryanair had 22 aircraft based at Dublin Airport. Last year we
 reduced this by 20% to 18 aircraft and this year we're cutting it by a further
 20% to just 14 aircraft. The high and rising costs at Dublin Airport, combined
 with an insanely stupid EUR10 tourist tax, are devastating tourism here in
 Ireland. These cuts come just  one day after Ryanair announced 39 new routes to
 the Canaries this Winter where the Spanish Government has reduced airport fees
 to zero. Last week Ryanair announced 11 new routes to Oslo airports this winter
 where again airport fees have been substantially reduced.
"The response of the Government owned DAA monopoly to this 11% traffic collapse
 is  to seek yet further price increases! The incompetent Irish Aviation
 Regulator has already proposed that Dublin airport charges for 2010 onwards will
 be "18% higher" than they would be if the DAA's traffic was not declining.
 Sadly the DAA gets rewarded by the regulator with price increases for its abject
 failure to grow and stimulate traffic.
"The Irish Government has compounded this tourism collapse by inflicting an
 insanely stupid EUR10 tourist tax on passengers at Irish airports at a time when
 the Belgian and Dutch Governments have scrapped their tourist taxes and the
 Spanish and Greek Governments have reduced their airport fees, in some cases to
 zero.  Ryanair again calls on the Irish Government to scrap this stupid EUR10
 tourist tax before even further damage is done to Irish tourism this winter".

RYANAIR ANNOUNCES Q1 PROFIT OF EUR137M
 FARES FALL 13% AS TRAFFIC GROWS 11% TO 17M PASSENGERS
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fare airline today (27 July 2009) announced a Q1
 Net Profit of EUR136.5m, a EUR115.5m (550%) increase over last year's Q1 figure.
 Total revenues were flat due to an 11% rise in traffic being offset by a 13%
 decline in average fares. Unit costs fell by 26% due to lower fuel prices
 (excluding fuel they fell by 5%) and reductions in staff, airport and handling
 costs.

Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
 +-----------------------------------+--------------+------------------+--------------+
Announcing these results Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
"These quarterly results are distorted by a 42% reduction in fuel costs. Thanks
 to a 13% reduction in average fares we grew traffic by 11%, which was a robust
 performance in a deep recession, when many of our competitors were cutting
 flights, losing traffic and reporting increased losses. Our Net Profit Margin
 rose to an industry leading 18% and our balance sheet was strengthened as cash
 balances rose to EUR2.5bn at the quarter end. Ancillary revenues also outpaced
 scheduled traffic growth and rose by 13% to EUR165.3m.
"Fuel costs fell by 42% to EUR214m as we reaped the benefit of not engaging in
 fuel hedging last year when prices were high. Unit costs (excluding fuel) fell
 by 5% as we continued to reduce costs across all other areas. We have taken
 advantage of the recent drop in fuel prices to extend our hedging programme for
 FY10 to 90% for the first 3 quarters at an ave. price of $620 per tonne and 60%
 for Q4 at $610 per tonne. Should we hedge the balance of our FY10 fuel at $620
 per tonne we would lock in a full year fuel cost saving of approx. EUR460m.
"Most of our competitors have recently reported declining traffic, falling
 yields and substantial losses. This is accelerating the pace of airline closures
 and consolidations. In recent weeks Sky Europe sought Chapter 11 protection in
 the Hungarian courts, and My Air ceased operations in Italy. Our Q1 traffic
 growth of 11% to 16.6m has extended Ryanair's leadership over the other Big 3
 (high fare, fuel surcharging) airline groups - Air France, BA and Lufthansa. Our
 successful roll out of new routes and bases demonstrates the fundamental
 strength of Ryanair's lowest fares model which even during deep recessions
 continues to deliver growth.
"The dramatic decline in Britain's traffic and tourism figures is directly due
 to the British government's GBP10 APD tax and the BAA's high airport charges. In
 the first half of 2009 traffic at the BAA's UK airports collapsed by 9%, a loss
 of almost 5m passengers. Sadly the Irish government decided to follow this
 failed tourism policy and imposed a EUR10 tourist tax in April. This caused
 Ireland to suffer a calamitous 18% decline in visitors in May alone, as a
 combination of the DAA's high airport fees and a crazy tourist tax, makes
 Ireland a totally uncompetitive tourism destination. We now expect the traffic
 at the main Irish airports to fall by 20% this winter as Irish tourism collapses
 under the weight of this EUR10 tourist tax. We again call on the Irish and British
 governments to follow the more sensible leads of the Belgian, Dutch, Greek and
 Spanish governments, all of whom have recently scrapped tourist taxes and have
 reduced airport charges, in some cases to zero, in order to stimulate tourism.
"Our 2 newest bases at Pescara and Trapani in Italy are performing well and we
 will open our 33rd European base at Porto (Northern Portugal) in September. We
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
 will base two aircraft there and will operate 11 routes, including four new
 routes, to Basel, Eindhoven, St. Etienne, and Tours. In Norway we will open
 seven new routes to/from Oslo-Rygge airport and four new routes from Oslo-Torp.
 This will offer Norwegian consumers even more competition, choice, and much
 lower fares compared to SAS's high fares and unjustified fuel surcharges.
"In Ireland airlines and passengers continue to suffer at the hands of an inept
 and incompetent aviation regulator who should be removed. Despite the recession
 and a traffic collapse at Dublin airport, this failed regulator has recently
 proposed further cost increases at Dublin Airport from January 2010, at a time
 when competitive airports all over Europe are reducing charges in order to grow
 traffic. This clueless regulator is totally out of touch with economic reality.
 He even admits that Dublin's latest price increases are 18% higher than they
 would have been if traffic had not fallen. Why is he rewarding Dublin airport
 for its traffic declines with an 18% price hike? As Dublin airport cost
 increase, the recent addition of the suicidal EUR10 tourist tax means that Irish
 passengers and tourism will continue to collapse in late 2009 and 2010.
"We announced plans to reduce Winter capacity at Stansted by 40% or 16 aircraft
 because of the BAA's unjustified increase in airport charges (despite enormous
 traffic falls) and the damage done to UK tourism by the GBP10 APD tourist tax.
 We will switch a substantial number of our aircraft from Irish and UK bases this
 winter to other European bases where progressive airports and sensible
 governments are scrapping tourist taxes and/or reducing airport fees, in some
 cases to zero.
"Our outlook remains cautious for the remainder of the fiscal year. Traffic
 growth is strong but at much weaker yields due to the recession and the impact
 of tourist tax in Ireland and the UK. We have limited visibility beyond the next
 two months but expect passengers to be very price sensitive for the rest of the
 year. On Friday last Lufthansa confirmed they were facing "crippling ticket
 price wars", and its economy traffic had "sunk drastically", as it struggled to
 compete with Ryanair's low fares (Note 2). We remain on track to deliver traffic
 growth of 15% to 67m passengers. We expect unit costs (excluding fuel) to fall
 by approx. 5%, and fuel costs will also be substantially lower thanks to our
 renewed hedging programme. We intend to use these fuel and other cost savings to
 fund continuous fare reductions. As a result we expect Q2 yields will be
 significantly lower than last year, at or even slightly above the minus 15% to
 20% range previously guided. Based on this yield performance in H1 we expect the
 full year yield decline will be at or slightly more than minus 20% and
 accordingly, our full year net profit will be towards the lower end of the EUR200m
 to EUR300m range, previously guided.
"We continue to see enormous opportunities to grow our business. We are besieged
 by many European airports who realise that Ryanair is their only credible
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
 partner if they wish to reverse recent traffic declines or to deliver growth.
 Many of our competitors are guiding increased losses and declining traffic or in
 some cases (such as Aer Lingus) have refused to give any guidance at all.
 Ryanair will be the only major European airline to deliver passenger and profit
 growth in the current year. The winners in a deep recession will always be those
 companies like Aldi, Lidl, McDonalds, and Ryanair who offer the lowest prices
 and the best service to consumers. We will continue to expand as others fail. We
 will also continue to drive down costs and pass these on in the form of lower
 fares right across Europe for the benefit of each of our 67m passengers".
ENDS.                  Monday, 27th July 2009
Note 1 - Excludes exceptional items. Exceptional items in the Quarter ended June

Reconciliation of results for the period under IFRS to adjusted results for the
 quarter ended June 30, 2009
The condensed consolidated interim income statement for quarter ended June 30,
 2009, as set forth on page 2 of this interim financial report, presents the
 results for the quarter separately between pre-exceptional and exceptional
 items. Certain items are presented separately, as exceptional items, which, by
 virtue of their size or incidence, are unusual in the context of the Group's
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -5-
 ongoing core operations, as we believe this presentation represents the
 underlying business more accurately and reflects the manner in which investors
 typically analyse the results.
In the current period we have presented an impairment of a financial asset
 investment separately because of the unusual nature of this item.  In the
 comparative quarter, in addition to the impairment of a financial asset, we have
 also categorised accelerated depreciation related to aircraft disposals as
 exceptional.  Any amounts deemed "exceptional" for management discussion and

All of the Group's operating profit arises from low fares airline-related
 activities, its only business segment. The major revenue earning assets of the
 Group are comprised of its aircraft fleet, which is registered in Ireland and
 therefore principally all profits accrue in Ireland. Since the Group's aircraft
 fleet is flexibly employed across its route network in Europe, there is no
 suitable basis of allocating such assets and related liabilities to geographical
 segments.

Diluted earnings per share takes account solely of the potential future
 exercises of share options granted under the Company's share option schemes and
 the weighted average number of shares includes weighted average share options
 assumed to be converted of 6.3m (2008: nil). For the quarter ended June 30, 2008
 there were no differences in the weighted-average number of ordinary shares used
 for basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share as the effect of all
 potentially dilutive ordinary shares of 2.2m outstanding was anti-dilutive.
12.  Property, plant and equipment
 Acquisitions and disposals
 During the quarter ended June 30, 2009, the Group acquired assets with a cost of
 EUR348.6m (quarter ended June 30, 2008: EUR110.4m).There were three Boeing 737-800
 aircraft disposed of during the period, the balance of the sales proceeds of
 which amounted to EUR65.6m.
13.  Post balance sheet events
 There were no significant post balance sheet events.
14.  US GAAP Reconciliation
 Following on from the issuance by the SEC of Rule 3235 "Acceptance from Foreign
 Private Issuers of Financial Statements prepared in accordance with
 International Financial Reporting Standards without reconciliation to US GAAP",
 the Group has chosen to exclude a US GAAP Reconciliation from these preliminary
 financial statements.
15.  Related party transactions
 We have related party relationships with our subsidiaries, directors and senior
 key management personnel. All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on
 consolidation and are not disclosed.
 There were no related party transactions that have taken place in the quarter
 ended June 30, 2009 that materially affected the financial position or the
 performance of the Company during the period and there were no changes in the
 related parties described in the 2008 Annual Report that could have a material
 effect on the financial position or performance of the Company in the year.

 passenger volumes on existing routes offset by a 13% decrease in average fares,
 due to the global recession, price promotions, lower baggage penetration rates,
 and the adverse impact of the movement in euro/sterling exchange rates.Load
 factor increased by 2 points to 83%, compared to the quarter ended June 30,
 2008.
Ancillary revenues continue to outpace the growth in passenger volumes and rose
 by 13% to EUR165.3m (21% of our total operating revenue).
Total operating expenses decreased by 17% to EUR620.0m primarily due to
 the 42% decrease in fuel prices and 5% unit cost reductions (ex fuel) delivered
 in the quarter offset somewhat by the higher level of activity and costs
 associated with the growth of the airline.
Staff costs increased by 2% to EUR82.4m.  This reflects a 10% increase in average
 employee headcount to 6,938, offset by the impact of a company wide pay freeze,
 the higher portion of contract pilots operating during the quarter, and the rise
 in cabin crew numbers during the quarter who earn lower than the average salary.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 17% to EUR55.0m. This reflects, net of
 disposals, an additional 22 lower cost 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this
 quarter compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2008 and the impact of overhaul
 checks undertaken during the quarter.
Fuel costs decreased by 42% to EUR214.1m primarily due to the lower cost of fuel
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -7-
 in the period.
Maintenance costs increased by 34% to EUR19.2m due to a 21% increase in the number
 of leased aircraft from 39 to 47 and additional costs arising from increased
 line maintenance activity at new bases.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 14% to EUR21.7m, which is lower than the 21%
 increase in the number of leased aircraft from 39 to 47 compared to the quarter
 ended June 30, 2008, reflecting the positive impact of lower lease
 rentals obtained.
Route charges rose by 10% to EUR81.2m due to an increase in the number of sectors
 flown offset by the positive impact of a stronger euro versus sterling.
Airport & handling charges increased by 3% to EUR116.7m due to an 11% increase in
 passenger volumes, offset by lower costs at new airports and bases launched and
 savings achieved on handling costs.
Marketing, distribution and other expenses decreased by 17% to EUR29.7m, which is
 lower than the growth in ancillary revenues, due to improved margins on some
 existing products, cost reductions on some indirect costs and the increased
 focus on internet based promotions.
Operating margin increased by 17 points to 20% due to the reasons outlined above
 and operating profits have increased by EUR129.0m to EUR154.7m compared to
 the quarter ended June 30, 2008.
Finance income decreased by 67% to EUR7.4m primarily due to the impact of lower
 base interest rates and the prudent placement of funds with highly rated and
 guaranteed financial institutions.
Finance expense decreased by 39% to EUR18.3m primarily due to the impact of lower
 interest rates and the drawdown of debt to part finance the purchase of new
 aircraft.
Foreign exchange gains during the period of EUR2.7m are primarily due to the
 impact of changes in the sterling rate against the euro.
Balance sheet
 Gross cash increased by EUR221.9m to EUR2,500.1m. The Group generated cash from
 operating activities of EUR291.8m and a further EUR65.6 from the sale proceeds of
 three Boeing 737-800 aircraft, which together partially funded capital
 expenditure in the quarter. Capital expenditure of EUR348.6m largely consisted of
 advance aircraft payments for future aircraft deliveries and the delivery of 18
 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft.  Long term debt, net of repayments, increased by
 EUR206.5m to EUR2,604.9m during the quarter.The Group had net debt of EUR104.8m at
 quarter end compared to net debt of EUR120.2m at March 31, 2009.
 Shareholders' equity at June 30, 2009 increased by EUR113.4m to EUR2,538.5m,
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -7-
 compared to March 31, 2009 due to the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for
 derivative financial investments, pensions and stock option grants and the post
 exceptional profit of EUR123.0m in the quarter. (See details in note 9).
Ryanair Holdings plc
 Notes forming Part of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
 Interim Financial Statements
1.  Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The
 unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for
 the quarter ended June 30, 2009 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries
 (together referred to as the "Group").
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 31,
 2008 are available at www.ryanair.com.
 These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the
 interim financial statements"), which should be read in conjunction with our
 2008 Annual Report, have been prepared in accordance with International
 Accounting Standard No. 34 ("IAS 34") "Interim Financial Reporting" as adopted
 by the EU. They do not include all of the information required for full annual
 financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent
 published consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been
 prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most
 recent published consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in
 accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and in compliance with IFRS's as
 issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2009 do not
 constitute statutory financial statements of the Group within the meaning of the
 Companies (Amendment) Act, 1986. Statutory financial statements for the year
 ended March 31, 2008 were filed with the Companies office and are also available
 on the Company's website.  The independent auditor's report on these financial
 statements was unqualified.
Exceptional items
 The Company presents certain items separately, which are unusual, by virtue of
 their size and incidence, in the context of our ongoing core operations, as we
 believe this presentation represents the underlying business more accurately and
 reflects the manner in which investors typically analyse the results. In the
 current period we have presented an impairment of a financial asset investment
 because of the unusual nature of this item. Any amounts deemed "exceptional" for
 management discussion and analysis purposes have been classified for the
 purposes of the income statement in the same way as non exceptional amounts of
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -7-
 the same nature.
The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors,
 approved the interim financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 on
 July 24, 2009.
2.  Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements,
 estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual
 results may differ from these estimates.
Except as described below, in preparing these unaudited condensed consolidated
 financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in applying
 the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty
 were the same as those that applied in the most recent published consolidated
 financial statements.
3.  Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to
 quarter, and management expects these variations to continue. Among the factors
 causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to general
 economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Accordingly the first
 half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
4.  Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the
 quarter ended June 30, 2009 was 8.6%.  The tax charge of EUR11.6m primarily
 comprises a deferred tax charge relating to the utilisation of previous trading
 losses.
5.  Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programmes are disclosed in the
 most recent published consolidated financial statements.  The charge to the
 income statement in the quarter of approximately EUR1.6m is related to the fair
 value of various share options granted in prior years, which are being
 recognised within the income statement in accordance with employee services
 rendered.
6.  Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its
 business.  The Group does not believe that any such litigation will individually
 or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
 Group. Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, management
 believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not
 expected to materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or
 financial position.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -7-
7.  Capital commitments
 At June 30, 2009 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 196 Boeing 737-800 aircraft.
 It also had firm orders for an additional 116 Boeing 737-800's. The delivery of
 these firm order aircraft will increase the fleet size (net of planned
 disposals) to 292 aircraft by March 31, 2012.
8.  Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 In the quarter ended June 30, 2009, the Group recorded an impairment charge of
 EUR13.5m on its shareholding in Aer Lingus reflecting a further decline in the Aer
 Lingus share price from EUR0.59 per share at March 31, 2009 to EUR0.50 at June 30,
 2009.

Accelerated depreciation of EUR17.9m arose in the quarter ended June 30, 2008 on
 aircraft ultimately disposed of in the financial year 2009/2010, to write these
 aircraft down to their recoverable amounts when disposal occurs, thus leading to
 no gain or loss on disposal.
Impairment charge:  During the quarter the Group recorded an impairment charge

 of EUR13.5m (2008: EUR93.6m) on its Aer Lingus shareholding reflecting the decline
 in the Aer Lingus share price from EUR0.59 per share at March 31, 2009 to EUR0.50
 per share at June 30, 2009.

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Operating and Financial Overview
Introduction
For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") all figures
 and comments are by reference to the adjusted results excluding the exceptional
 items referred to below.  A reconciliation of the results for the period under
 IFRS to the adjusted results is provided on page 5.
Exceptional items in the quarter ended June 30, 2009 amounted to EUR13.5m
 reflecting an impairment of the Aer Lingus shareholding. Exceptional items in
 the quarter ended June 30, 2008 amounted to EUR111.5m consisting of an impairment
 of the Aer Lingus shareholding of EUR93.6m and an accelerated depreciation charge
 of EUR17.9m on aircraft ultimately disposed of in the financial years 2009/2010.
Adjusted profit excluding exceptional items increased by EUR115.5m to EUR136.5m in
 the quarter ended June 30, 2009. Including exceptional items the profit for the
 quarter was EUR123.0m compared to a loss of EUR90.5m in the quarter ended June
 30, 2008.
 Summary quarter ended June 30, 2009
Adjusted profit after tax increased by EUR115.5m to EUR136.5m compared to EUR21.0m in
 the quarter ended June 30, 2008 primarily due to a 42% decrease in fuel
 costs, partially offset by a 13% decline in average fares.  Total operating
 revenues remained relatively flat at EUR774.7m, despite an 11% growth in passenger
 volumes, as average fares declined by 13%, due to the global recession, price
 promotions and weaker euro/sterling exchange rates.  Ancillary revenues grew by
 13% to EUR165.3m during the quarter.  Total revenue per passenger, as a
 result, decreased by 10%, whilst the Load Factor increased by 2 points to 83%
 during the quarter.
Total operating expenses fell by 18% to EUR620.0m, primarily due to lower fuel
 prices, offset by the higher level of activity and increased operating costs
 associated with the growth of the airline.  Fuel, which represents 35% of total
 operating costs compared to 49% in the comparative quarter, decreased by 42% to
 EUR214.1m due to the drop in the price per gallon paid offset by an increase in
 the number of hours flown.  Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 5% and including
 fuel they fell by 26%.  Operating margin increased by 17 points to 20%
 whilst operating profit increased by EUR129.0m to EUR154.7m.
Net margin increased from 3% at June 30, 2008 to 18% in the current quarter for
 the reasons outlined above.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -6-
Adjusted earnings per share for the year was 9.26 euro cent compared to earnings
 per share of 1.42 euro cent in the quarter ended June 30, 2008.
Gross cash increased by EUR221.9m to EUR2,500.1m. The Group generated cash from
 operating activities of EUR291.8m and a further EUR65.6m from the sale proceeds of
 three Boeing 737-800 aircraft, which together partially funded capital
 expenditure in the quarter.  Capital expenditure of EUR348.6m largely consisted of
 advance aircraft payments for future aircraft deliveries and the delivery of 18
 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft.  Long term debt, net of repayments, increased by
 EUR206.5m to EUR2,604.9m during the quarter.The Group had net debt of EUR104.8m at
 quarter end compared to net debt of EUR120.2m at March 31, 2009.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis quarter ended June 30, 2009
Adjusted profit after tax, increased by EUR115.5m to EUR136.5m primarily due
 to lower fuel costs, partially offset by a 13% decline in average fares.  Total
 operating revenues remained relatively flat at EUR774.7m as average fares fell by
 13% due to the global recession, price promotions and the adverse impact of the
 movement in euro/sterling exchange rates, offset by an 11% increase in passenger
 numbers and strong growth in ancillary revenues. Fuel, which represents 35% of

 RYANAIR CUTS STANSTED WINTER CAPACITY BY 40%
Ryanair, the World's favourite airline, today (21st July 09) announced a 40%
 capacity cutback in its Stansted Winter Schedule starting in October '09.
 Ryanair operated 40 aircraft from Stansted this summer but will reduce this to
 24 aircraft (a 40% reduction) this winter with a 30% reduction in the number of
 weekly flights and a loss of 2.5m passengers at Stansted between October and
 March 2010.
Ryanair is cutting Stansted winter capacity by 40% for the following reasons:
1.  BAA Stansted is one of Ryanair's two most expensive bases (Dublin is the other)
 and the BAA has rejected Ryanair's calls for deep cuts in these high passenger
 fees this winter.
2.   The UK Government will increase its GBP10 tourist tax (APD) to GBP11
 in November despite the continuing traffic and tourism
collapse (down
 6% in June) at the BAA's UK airports.
3.    The BAA Monopoly continues to increase airport charges as traffic
 falls and the BAA delays the sale of Gatwick and

In recent months the Belgian, Dutch, Greek and Spanish governments have all
 scrapped tourist taxes and/or reduced airport charges to zero in order to
 stimulate tourism.  Ryanair will now switch these 16 aircraft to other European
 bases where governments are scrapping tourist taxes and/or reducing passenger
 fees to zero. Ryanair has written to Gordon Brown calling for this Government to
 scrap this damaging tourist tax and pushing for much lower, more competitive
 airport fees at the BAA Monopoly airports.
Announcing this 40% winter cutback at Stansted, Michael O'Leary said:
"Sadly UK traffic and tourism continues to collapse while Ryanair continues to
 grow traffic rapidly in those countries which welcome tourists instead of taxing
 them.  Ryanair's 40% capacity cutback at London Stansted shows just how much
 Gordon Brown's GBP10 tourist tax and the BAA Monopoly's high airport charges are
 damaging London and UK tourism and the British economy generally.
"In recent months the Belgian, Dutch, Greek and Spanish governments have all
 scrapped tourist taxes and/or reduced airport charges to zero in order to
 stimulate tourism. These cutbacks underline the urgent need to; (a) break-up the
 high cost BAA Airport Monopoly (as recommended by the Competition Commission)

 RYANAIR CALLS ON UK GOVERNMENT TO SCRAP GBP10 TRAVEL TAX AS BAA AIRPORTS
 TRAFFIC FALLS 6% IN JUNE
 WHILE RYANAIRS TRAFFIC RISES 13% IN JUNE
 Ryanair, the World's favourite airline, today (15th July 2009) called on the UK
 Government to scrap its suicidal GBP10 APD travel tax after the BAA
 Airports' June traffic fell by 6% to just 12.7m - 800,000 fewer passengers than
 June 2008.  While the UK's traffic and tourism declines Ryanair's June traffic
 grew by 13% to a new monthly record of 5.8m passengers (up 700,000 on June
 2008).

Ryanair believes that the UK's traffic and tourism decline is a direct result of
 the Government's GBP10 APD tourist tax and the high/increasing charges imposed
 on passengers by the BAA's monopoly airports.  Ryanair called again on Gordon
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR CALLS ON UK GOVERNMENT TO SCRAP 10 TAX
 Brown's Government to follow the recent example of the Belgian, Dutch, Greek and
 Spanish governments all of whom have scrapped tourist taxes and/or reduced
 airport charges to zero in order to stimulate tourism.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
"Ryanair continues to grow rapidly as consumers switch from BA's high fares and
 fuel surcharges to Ryanair's low fares. Our June traffic grew by 13% or 700,000
 to a new monthly record of 5.8 million passengers, while traffic at the UK's BAA
 Monopoly Airports fell by 6% or 800,000 fewer passengers than in June 2008.
"Gordon Brown should now follow the example of the Belgian, Dutch, Greek and
 Spanish governments, stop taxing tourists and start welcoming them.Ryanair has
 already announced a freeze on growth from the UK.  Britain's traffic and tourism
 losses will continue to collapse if the Government's GBP10 APD tourist tax is
 not scrapped urgently."

 unjustified fuel surcharges.  Ryanair's passenger traffic grew by 13% in June to

Body
 The NAV per share fell by 49.2% in the year under review (2008: a decrease of
 13.5%) compared with a sterling adjusted decrease in the ISEQ Index of 58.7%
 (2008: a decrease of 22.6%). The mid-market price of the Company's Ordinary
 shares fell by 55.0% (2008: a fall of 22.2%). Positive contributors to
 performance included the Company's investments in CRH and Ryanair, which
 showed considerable resilience even as the broad stock market fell back
 sharply. Net cash balances, which were held through most of the year, also
 benefitted returns. Conversely, investments in Fyffes and Smurfit Kappa Group
 detracted from returns.
It is also relevant to consider performance over a longer period. The
 Company's investment policy was varied in 2002 to allow the inclusion in the
 portfolio of the largest quoted companies in the investment universe;
 previously they had been excluded. In the period since 31 March 2002, the NAV
 per share has increased by 75.4% compared with a decrease in the ISEQ Index of
 36.0% and an increase in the Davy Mid-Cap Index of 25.6%. Over the same
 period, the FTSE All-Share Index decreased by 22.4%, with the Hoare Govett
 Smaller Companies Index down 3.5% and the FTSE Europe ex UK Index down 5.3%.
 The mid-market price of the Company's Ordinary shares increased by 56.2% over
 this period
For more information regarding the Company's performance, please refer to the
 Chairman's Statement, the Manager's Review and the financial statistics.
Gartmore Irish Annual Financial Report -4-
Financial Position
The Company's net assets at 31 March 2009 amounted to GBP48.8 million, compared
 with GBP113.7 million at 31 March 2008. GBP10.7 million of this reduction resulted
 from the buy-back of shares. All of the Company's investments are listed on
 recognised exchanges and are realisable in normal market conditions.
There were no borrowings at 31 March 2009.
Share Capital
At the year end the Company's issued share capital comprised 10,968,342
 Ordinary shares, none of which were held in Treasury (2008: 12,987,542 and
 zero respectively). At general meetings of the Company, the holders of the
 Ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for every share held.
During the year 2,019,200 shares were bought back for cancellation at prices
 ranging from 314.99p to 770.00p per share (excluding expenses) at discounts to
 NAV (including current period revenue) of between 7.52% and 24.31% and
 representing 15.55% of the shares in issue on 1 April 2008. Since 31 March
 2009, no further shares have been bought back for cancellation.
No shares were issued during the year, but the Directors favour increasing the
 number of shares in issue if this can be achieved at prices that will not
 dilute the interests of existing shareholders. Increasing the size of the
 Company could improve the liquidity of its shares in the market and would
 dilute the impact of fixed costs.
Discount Management
At the year end, the Company's share price stood at a discount of 21.6% to NAV
 compared with a discount of 11.5% a year ago. During the year, the discount
 ranged from 5.95% to 23.33% (using the NAV including current period revenue).
 The Board has been willing to buy stock for cancellation, or to be held in
 Treasury, and during the year shares purchased have been cancelled. This had
 the dual benefits of increasing short-term demand for the Company's shares and
 resulting in a modest uplift in the NAV. The Company will continue, as and
 when appropriate, to exercise its powers to buy back shares.
Dividends and Total Expense Ratio
The net revenue return for the year, after expenses and taxation, amounted to
 GBP1,541,000, compared with a net revenue return of GBP144,000 for the previous
 year. GBP1,074,000 of this year's increase arises from the recovery during the
 year of VAT paid on past management fees, together with related interest. The
 Company's total expense ratio to average net assets ("TER") for the year was
 2.3% (excluding the VAT recovery but reflecting the effect of costs on a
 significantly reduced portfolio value) (2008: 1.5%). The Directors are
Gartmore Irish Annual Financial Report -4-
 recommending a final dividend for the year of 1.27p per share (2008: 1.06p).
 In addition, a special dividend of 10.88p primarily relating to the VAT
 recovery is also being proposed. These dividends will be paid, if approved, on
 21 September 2009 to shareholders on the register on 21 August 2009.
Corporate Social Responsibility and Socially Responsible Investment
The Company has no employees and the Board is comprised entirely of
 non-executive Directors. As an investment trust, the Company has no direct
 impact on the environment. In carrying out its activities and in relationships
 with suppliers and the community, the Company aims to conduct itself
 responsibly, ethically and fairly.
The Company has delegated responsibility for making and holding investments to
 the Manager. The Company's policy is that, subject to an overriding
 requirement to pursue the best financial interests of the Company and its
 shareholders, the Manager should take account of social, environmental and
 ethical factors.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The principal risks and the Company's policies for managing these risks and
 the policy and practice with regard to financial instruments are summarised in
 note 24 to the financial statements.
The following additional risks and uncertainties have been identified and are
 discussed below, with an outline of how the Board recognises and seeks to
 control these risks.
Poor Company and Market Performance
Since the Company is an investment company, returns to shareholders depend
 upon the performance of the companies and the stock markets in which it
 invests. Until recently the trend had been positive for some time, but, as
 experienced in recent unsettled markets, this can change over time.
 Consequently, there is potential for the Company to suffer periods of low or
 negative returns. Investment risk is spread by holding a diversified portfolio
 of approximately 40 holdings. In accordance with the Listing Rules, the Board,
 acting in its capacity as the management engagement committee, reviews
 performance and the continuing engagement of the Manager on an ongoing basis.
 The basis of the Board's reappointment of the Manager is explained below.
Limited Investment Universe
The scale of the Irish and Northern Irish economies is relatively modest when
 compared to those of the Eurozone or the UK. The Company has a limited
 universe of stocks within which it can invest, with the largest holdings
 tending to be between 3% and 15% of the value of the portfolio. The Company is
Gartmore Irish Annual Financial Report -4-
 therefore subject to the uncertainties relating to a relatively small number
 of holdings, including the risks of volatility. Additionally, since the
 portfolio has no precise correlation with the various comparator indices,
 performance can be expected to deviate significantly from those indices. The
 focused nature of the portfolio offers shareholders the prospect of
 significant capital gain if the positive trends anticipated deliver good
 investment returns.
Gearing
The Company has the ability to gear to up to 25% of the Group's net assets.
 The use of debt magnifies movements in the asset value of the Company, be they
 positive or negative. The level of gearing is regularly monitored by the
 Board.
Previously, gearing has been achieved through the use of flexible borrowing
 facilities. In the recent turbulence in banking markets in Ireland and in
 other countries, the Company has not been able to renew its borrowing
 facilities on acceptable terms. The Board has accordingly authorised the
 Manager to use contracts for difference ("CFDs") for gearing purposes. The use
 of CFDs is subject to the limits which applied when bank loan facilities were
 used, and total gearing remains subject to a maximum of 25% of shareholders'
 funds.
Third Party Advisers
Like most investment trust companies, the Company has no employees. All of the
 Directors are non-executive. The Company relies on services provided by third
 parties, including, in particular, the Manager, Gartmore Investment Limited,
 Capita Sinclair Henderson Limited, who provide company secretarial and
 accounting services, and The Northern Trust Company, who act as custodian. The
 Company reviews the internal control procedures of its service providers on a
 regular basis.
Regulatory Breaches
Relevant legislation and regulations which apply to the Company include the
 Companies Act 1985 and the Companies Act 2006 (as enacted) (the "Companies
 Acts"), the ICTA and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority
 ("FSA"). The Company has noted the recommendations of the Combined Code on
 Corporate Governance and the AIC Code of Corporate Governance and the relevant
 AIC Guide for investment companies. A breach of ICTA could result in the
 Company losing its status as an investment trust company and becoming subject
 to capital gains tax, whilst a breach of the Listing Rules might result in
 censure by the FSA. At each Board meeting the status of the Company is
 considered and discussed, so as to check that all regulations are being
 adhered to by the Company and its service providers.
Gartmore Irish Annual Financial Report -4-
There have been no breaches of laws or regulation during the period under
 review and up to the date of this report.
Life of the Company
The Company's Articles of Association contain a requirement for shareholders
 to vote on the continuation of the Company every three years. Under this
 provision, if that resolution is not passed the Directors will, within three
 months thereafter, convene an Extraordinary General Meeting at which a special
 resolution for winding up will be proposed. Shareholders voted for the Company
 to continue as an investment trust at the Annual General Meeting in 2008. The
 next continuation vote will accordingly be put to shareholders at the Annual
 General Meeting to be held in 2011.
Future Trends
While slowing economic growth and euro strength in relation to both sterling
 and the US dollar constitute headwinds in the near term, favourable local

 GOVERNMENT MUST SCRAP GBP10 TOURIST TAX AND BREAKUP BAA MONOPOLY AS BAA TRAFFIC
 FALLS 4.5 MILLION IN 5 MONTHS
Ryanair freezes growth at 9 UK bases with immediate effect
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (23rd June 09) confirmed that
 it will freeze growth at its nine UK bases with immediate effect. Ryanair
 highlighted that Gordon Brown's GBP10 tourist tax, combined with the
 BAA Monopoly's high airport charges have caused the loss of over 4.5 million
 passengers at the BAA UK airports in the first five months of the year.
Ryanair called on Gordon Brown to scrap this GBP10 APD tax and speed up the sale
 of Gatwick and Stansted airports to prevent a further collapse in UK tourism and
 related jobs next winter.  If the UK traffic collapse continues for the full
 year the UK economy will lose over 10 million passengers, 10,000 airport jobs
 and over GBP2.5billion in tourism spend in 2009 alone, with the Government
 losing at least GBP350 million in VAT receipts.
The UK is now a high cost tourism destination which is in steep decline. Ryanair
 urged the British Government to follow the lead of the Belgian, Dutch, Greek and
 Spanish Governments who have recently scrapped similar tourist taxes and/or
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Freezes Growth at 9 UK Bases
 airport charges in order to reverse falling passenger numbers and prevent
 further tourism and job losses.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"Ryanair will grow by 15% this year to over 67 million passengers. However, the
 UK will not share in any of this growth in 2009 as Ryanair (the only major
 European airline continuing to grow) freezes growth at our nine UK bases.
 Gordon Brown's GBP10 tourist tax will see Britain lose over 10 million
 passengers, 10,000 airport jobs and more than GBP2.5 billion in tourism spend in
 the UK this year alone.The Government should follow the example of their
 Belgian, Dutch, Greek and Spanish counterparts by immediately scrapping this
 stupid and regressive tourist tax to avoid any further devastation to British
 tourism and jobs.
"Tourism is one of the UK's most important industries and employers. It responds
 quickly to price changes. The Government's GBP10 tourist tax is making the UK an
 uncompetitive destination and they must scrap this tax now to prevent a further
 collapse of UK passenger, tourism and job numbers.  While the UK keeps taxing
 tourists Ryanair will switch its growth to other EU countries where low cost
 airports are growing and where Governments are welcoming tourists not taxing
 them".

 RYANAIR CUTS WINTER FLIGHTS & JOBS AS
 IRISH GOVT'S EUR10 TAX DEVASTATES TOURISM
Ryanair, Ireland's largest airline, today (17th June 09) announced cuts in its
 winter based aircraft, flights and jobs at Dublin and Shannon Airports as the
 Government's EUR10 tourist tax continues to devastate Irish traffic and tourism.
In the first five months of 2009 traffic at Dublin Airport has fallen by 11%, a
 loss of 1 million passengers in just five months. If this traffic collapse
 continues for the full year it will mean the loss of 2.5 million passengers,
 2,500 jobs at Dublin Airport and EUR750 million of tourism spend in the Irish
 economy in 2009.
Ryanair today announced that it will cut its base aircraft by one at both Dublin
 (from 17 to 16) and Shannon (from 4 to 3) this winter, resulting in the loss of
 350,000 passengers and 350 jobs at Dublin Airport and a further 300,000
 passengers and 300 jobs in Shannon Airport.
Further cuts in winter flight and traffic numbers will be announced in the
 coming months if the Government fails to scrap this EUR10 tourist tax. Ryanair
 will switch these aircraft and continue to grow in lower cost/no tourist tax
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Cuts Winter Flights And Jobs
 countries such as Belgium, Holland, Greece and Spain where governments have
 recently scrapped tourist taxes and airport charges to promote tourism.
Ryanair confirmed that these winter cutbacks can be reversed if the Government
 scraps its EUR10 tourist tax.
Ryanair announced reductions as follows for the winter 2009 schedule:
*  A 25% cut in Shannon based aircraft (4 to 3).
 *  A 6% cut in Dublin based aircraft (17 to 16).
 *  A cut of 36 flights per week at Shannon.
 *  A cut of 44 flights per week at Dublin.
 *  The loss of 650 airport and tourism jobs.
 *  The loss of EUR750 million in tourism spend.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"The Irish Government's EUR10 tourist tax is "tourism suicide" which
 is devastating visitor numbers and jobs.  Price sensitive visitors are switching
 to lower cost destinations in Europe where governments welcome tourists, not tax
 them.
"Ryanair will remove one aircraft from both Dublin and Shannon this winter and
 further cuts can be expected in the coming months if the EUR10 tourist tax is not
 scrapped.  If the tourist tax is scrapped these cuts, and the tourism collapse,
 will be reversed.
This tourist tax will raise just EUR125 million per annum and for this tiny tax
 revenue the Irish government will lose over 2,500 jobs and more than EUR750
 million in tourism spend, the VAT receipts on which would exceed EUR150 million".

 RYANAIR CALLS FOR  EARLY SALE OF LONDON STANSTED  AS TRAFFIC COLLAPSES
Ryanair, the UK's largest airline, today (10th June 2009) called for the early
 sale of London Stansted after BAA figures confirmed that passenger traffic at
 the airport collapsed by 19% in May and highlighted that traffic has now
 plummeted by 15% at London Stansted in the first five months of 2009.
Ryanair also called for Gordon Brown to follow the lead of the Belgian and Dutch
 governments by scrapping his GBP10 tourist tax in response to the 7% fall in
 traffic at BAA's UK airports so far this year which has resulted in huge losses
 for London and UK tourism.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said,
"Today's confirmation that London Stansted traffic has collapsed by 19% so far
 this year, proves that the Competition Commission's recommendation that that
 airport be sold is the only way to protect London tourism and jobs and we call
 for the fast-tracking of its sale in order to tackle the airport's plummeting
 traffic.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR CALLS FOR EARLY SALE OF LONDON STANSTED
The abysmal performance of the BAA airports underlines the urgent need for
 government action to protect UK tourism and UK jobs.  BAA airports have lost
 almost 5 million passengers so far this year and the UK Government must follow
 the lead of the Belgian and Dutch governments by scrapping its insane GBP10
 tourist tax."

 Ryanair's UNBEATABLE PUNCTUALITY forceS Easyjet to hide their poor performance
 Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (5th June) confirmed that its
 unrivalled on-time performance has resulted in Easyjet refusing to publish their
 on-time statistics on their website since 27th April last.  Ryanair is Europe's
 most punctual airline with 92% of April flights on-time compared to just 83% of
 Easyjet's.  Ryanair's punctuality has out performed Easyjet's every week since
 2003 and Ryanair challenged Easyjet to recommence publishing weekly punctuality
 statistics.
Ryanair is committed to publishing customer service statistics each month and
 these confirm that Ryanair delivers Europe's best customer service as:
 *  92% of Ryanair's 32,000+ flights during April arrived on time.
 *  Ryanair received less than 1 (0.98) complaints per 1,000 passengers in April.
 *  Ryanair received less than 1 (0.38) mislaid bag claim per 1,000 passengers in
 April.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said,
 "Ryanair is Europe's most punctual airline, beating Easyjet every week since
 2003, and is the only airline to guarantee the lowest fares and no fuel
 surcharges ever. Such is the gulf between Ryanair's and Easyjet's on-time
 performance that Easyjet has not published its punctuality statistics since 27
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 's Unbeatable Punctuality
 April to prevent passengers realizing that they can not compete with Ryanair's
 guaranteed lowest fares and unrivalled  punctuality.
 Ryanair is committed to publishing customer service statistics each month to
 prove that we are Europe's leading customer service provider and we challenge
 Easyjet to start publishing its on-time performance statistics once again."

 Aer Lingus rejects Ryanair's cost cutting proposals - again
Ryanair regrets today's (5th June 09) rejection by the Aer Lingus Board of two
 AGM resolutions to reduce the bloated fees paid to the Aer Lingus Non-Executive
 Directors and Chairman (all of whom were appointed by the Irish Government and
 trade unions).  This again proves that Aer Lingus and its Board are controlled
 by the Irish Government and the trade unions.   This perhaps explains why Aer
 Lingus continues to lurch from crisis to crisis losing passengers, losing money,
 and burning through the cash that shareholders provided to Aer Lingus at its
 September 2006 IPO.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
"Under the current Board and Irish Government control, Aer Lingus shareholders
 have lost over EUR1 billion in the value of their shares which have plummeted from
 over EUR3 in Jan '07 to less than 60c in May '09.  Aer Lingus has announced
 enormous losses in 2008 and has warned of significantly increased losses in
 2009, and urgently needs to cut costs and lower fares if it is to survive and
 thrive. Cutting bloated Directors' fees (which totalled EUR730,000 in 2008) to the
 2006 levels, is an appropriate place to start, but it seems that Colm Barrington
 and the Minister are more concerned about protecting these fat cat fees than
 they are about the future of Aer Lingus.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus rejects Ryanairs cost cutting proposals
"Sadly today's rejection of Ryanair's cost cutting proposals leaves the Board of
 Aer Lingus and the Minister for Transport with no credibility when they begin
 talking to staff and other suppliers over the coming months about the cost cuts
 needed to restore Aer Lingus to profitability. For example, how can trade union
 boss David Begg, who received almost EUR5,000 per Board meeting in 2008 seriously
 ask low paid Aer Lingus workers to accept pay cuts when his snout and that of
 Colm Barrington are firmly wedged in the Aer Lingus fees trough?"

3rd June, 2009
Mr Noel Dempsey TD
 Minister for Transport
 Transport House
 44 Kildare Street
 Dublin 2 OPEN LETTER
Dear Minister,
You have misunderstood (deliberately?) the nature of the proxy over Ryanair's
 29.8% shares which we have executed in your favour prior to Friday's AGM. The
 effect of this proxy gives you control (over Ryanair's 29.8% shareholding) and a
 55% majority vote on the two resolutions to cut the bloated EUR730,000 fees paid
 to Aer Lingus' Non-Exec Chairman and Non-Exec Directors, all of whom have been
 appointed by the Government and the trade unions/ESOT, (who between you control
 Aer Lingus and are sadly running it into the ground).
It is up to you whether you vote Ryanair's shares in favour of the resolutions
Ryanair Holdings PLC Open Letter to Irish Minister for Transport
 or in favour of Aer Lingus' recommendation to protect these bloated "Fat Cat"
 fees, but you cannot "decline our offer", since we have already executed the
 proxy in your favour.
As the Minister for Transport, who just two weeks ago was calling on Aer Lingus
 to cut costs, you must agree that the right place to start is to reduce these
 excessive Directors fees under which trade union bosses like David Begg were
 paid almost EUR5,000 per Board meeting last year and the Non-Exec Chairman who was
 paid an astounding EUR15,000 per Board meeting.These resolutions, if passed by you
 on Friday will reduce Aer Lingus' costs by over EUR500,000 p.a. and will
 significantly boost Aer Lingus' profitability and shareholder value.  Should you
 fail to cut these excessive fees, then sadly you will have as little credibility
 as the Board of Aer Lingus, when in the coming months they seek to cut employee
 costs to reduce Aer Lingus' enormous losses. Perhaps Friday is the last chance
 for the Minister for Transport to stop talking about cost cuts and actually do
 something useful in the interests of Aer Lingus' passengers and shareholders.Why
 is Aer Lingus charging high fares just to pay Government and Union Directors
 these enormous and unjustified fees?
Rest assured that when I'm not expanding Ryanair, lowering fares, and creating
 thousands of new jobs, I am always thinking of you. You have my deepest
 sympathies at presiding over the institutionally incompetent Department of
 Transport, which continues to control and preside over hopeless mismanagement in
 the Dublin Airport monopoly and Aer Lingus.
Yours sincerely
Michael O'Leary
 Chief Executive

Reconciliation of results for the period under IFRS to adjusted results for the
 year ended March 31, 2009
The condensed consolidated preliminary income statements for year ended March
 31, 2009, as set forth on page 2 of this preliminary announcement, presents the
 results for the year separately between pre-exceptional and exceptional items.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Full Year Results -6-
 Certain items are presented separately, as exceptional items, which, by virtue
 of their size or incidence, are unusual in the context of the Group's ongoing
 core operations, as we believe this presentation represents the underlying
 business more accurately and reflects the manner in which investors typically
 analyse the results.
In the current period we have presented an impairment of a financial asset
 investment and also accelerated depreciation related to aircraft disposals
 separately because of the unusual nature of these items. Any amounts deemed
 "exceptional" for management discussion and analysis purposes have been
 classified for the purposes of the income statement in the same way as non
 exceptional amounts of the same nature.

11.  Analysis of operating revenues and segmental analysis
 All revenues derive from the Group's principal activity and business segment as
 a low fares airline and includes  scheduled services, car hire, internet income
 and related sales to third parties.
Revenue is analysed by geographical area (by country of origin) as follows:

All of the Group's operating profit arises from low fares airline-related
 activities, its only business segment. The major revenue earning assets of the
 Group are comprised of its aircraft fleet, which is registered in Ireland and
 therefore principally all profits accrue in Ireland. Since the Group's aircraft
 fleet is flexibly employed across its route network in Europe, there is no
 suitable basis of allocating such assets and related liabilities to geographical
 segments.

Body
 Preliminary Financial Statements
1.  Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The
 unaudited condensed consolidated preliminary financial statements of the Company
 for the year ended March 31, 2009 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries
 (together referred to as the "Group").
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 31,
 2008 are available at www.ryanair.com.
 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial information included in the
 preliminary announcement is prepared based on accounting policies which are
 consistent with those accounting policies applied in the 2008 annual report. The
 condensed consolidated financial information for the year ended March 31, 2009
 is prepared in accordance with the measurement principles of IFRS as adopted by
 the EU and in compliance with the measurement principles of IFRSs as issued by
 the International Accounting Standards Board, which are effective at March 31,
 2009.
The condensed consolidated financial information presented herein does not
 constitute the Company's statutory financial statements for the years ended
 March 31, 2009 and 2008, within the meaning of the Companies (Amendment) Act,
 1986. The statutory financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2009 will
 be finalised on the basis of the financial information presented by the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Full Year Results -8-
 directors in this preliminary results announcement and, together with the
 independent auditor's report thereon, will be filed with the Irish Registrar of
 Companies following the Company's Annual General Meeting and will also be
 available on the Company's website. The 2009 annual report and consolidated
 financial statements will be circulated to shareholders shortly. Statutory
 financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2008 have been filed with the
 Irish Registrar of Companies. The independent auditor's report on those
 financial statements was unqualified.
The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors,
 approved the preliminary financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2009
 on May 29, 2009.
Reclassifications
 The Company has reclassified the following amounts in its comparative balance
 sheet as at March 31, 2008:
 *  a reclassification of EUR2.0m from other creditors to provisions, both within
 non-current liabilities, reflecting the present value of the Company's net
 pension obligations; and
 *  a reclassification of EUR23.1m from the capital redemption reserve fund to share
 premium related to the share buy-back.
Amounts have been reclassified so as to present these balances on a consistent
 basis with the current period presentation.
2.  Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements,
 estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual
 results may differ from these estimates.
 Except as described below, in preparing these unaudited condensed consolidated
 financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in applying
 the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty
 were the same as those that applied in the most recent published consolidated
 financial statements.
3.  Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to
 quarter, and management expects these variations to continue. Among the factors
 causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to general
 economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Accordingly the first
 half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
4.  Income tax credit
 The income tax credit of EUR11.3m is primarily due to a deferred tax asset in
 respect of losses recognised.

5.  Capital and reserves
 Share buy back programme.
 Pursuant to the share buy-back programme announced in February 2008, from April
 1, 2008 to date, the Company has repurchased and cancelled 18.1m shares at a
 total cost of EUR46.0m. This is equivalent to 1.2% of the issued share capital of
 the Company at March 31, 2009.
6.  Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programmes are disclosed in the
 most recent published consolidated financial statements.  The charge to the
 income statement in the period of approximately EUR3.8m is related to the fair
 value of various share options granted, which are being recognised within the
 income statement in accordance with employee services rendered.
7.  Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its
 business.  The Group does not believe that any such litigation will individually
 or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
 Group. Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, management
 believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not
 expected to materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or
 financial position.
8.  Capital commitments
 During the year ended March 31, 2009 the Group exercised thirty options
 under its contract with Boeing whereby it will increase its "firm" aircraft
 deliveries by this amount during 2011 and 2012 fiscal years.At March 31, 2009,
 this brings Ryanair's total firm orders for Boeing 737-800 aircraft to 134 and
 the total fleet size (net of planned disposals) to 291 by 2012.
9.  Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 In the year ended March 31, 2009, the Group recorded an impairment charge of
 EUR222.5m on its shareholding in Aer Lingus reflecting a further decline in the
 Aer Lingus share price from EUR2.00 per share at March 31, 2008 to EUR0.59 at March
 31, 2009.  The Aer Lingus shares are currently trading at approx EUR0.65 per
 share.

 Diluted earnings per share takes account solely of the potential future
 exercises of share options granted under the Company's share option schemes and
 the weighted average number of shares includes weighted average share options
 assumed to be converted of Nil (2008: 12.9m). For the year ended 31 March 2009
 there were no differences in the weighted-average number of ordinary shares used
 for basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share as the effect of all
 potentially dilutive ordinary shares of 2.7m outstanding was anti-dilutive.

 Acquisitions and disposals
 During the year ended March 31, 2009, the Group acquired assets with a cost of
 EUR702.0m (year ended March 31, 2008: EUR937.1m).There were 16 Boeing 737-800

 regional airline, which has a high cost base and declining traffic numbers. This
 has recently been confirmed by Aer Lingus' 2008 results which revealed an
 enormous after tax loss of EUR108m and forecast further substantial losses again
 in 2009. Aer Lingus continues to lose traffic on both its short and longhaul
 routes, and we believe it is suffering material losses at its two new bases in
 Belfast and Gatwick. We have urged the Board of Aer Lingus to take the action
 necessary to, stem these losses, reduce costs, lower fares, and restore the
 airline to growth and profitability. Sadly they continue to ignore our advice.
 It is hard to have any confidence in Mr Barrington or the Board, who have
 presided over yet another collapse in Aer Lingus' share price from over EUR1.30 in
 January to less than EUR0.60 in May. We believe Aer Lingus should start a new cost
 reduction programme by slashing its bloated non-executive director's fees to
 levels more appropriate for a company with a market cap of just EUR300m. Ryanair
 has and will continue to support sensible cost reduction measures in Aer Lingus
 but sadly we have no influence or control over this government and trade union
 ran airline.
We have at the year end written down our investment in Aer Lingus by a further
 EUR222m to a current value of just EUR93m which reflects Aer Lingus' year end share
 price of just EUR0.59. We remain deeply concerned about the future of Aer Lingus
 which continues to lose traffic, suffer rising losses and falling cash balances
 under a board which has shown it has no vision and no strategy for improving
 shareholder value.

Balance Sheet
 Ryanair's balance sheet continues to be one of the strongest in the industry
 with EUR2.3bn in cash and rising. Our large floating cash deposits provide a
 "no-cost" hedge to our floating debt but we intend to take advantage of
 historically low interest rates to lock in a portion of our 2009 aircraft
 deliveries at low fixed interest rates. Our long term dollar hedging strategy
 means that in 2009/10 we will be purchasing new aircraft at exceptionally low
 prices with a EUR/$ exchange rate of 1.46 which is significantly better than
 current market rates. We have recently completed the financing of 45 aircraft
 which deliver between October 2009 and September 2010 at very competitive rates,
 and as a result we are now fully financed for the next 16 months.
Outlook for 2009/10
 In fiscal 2009/10 we expect to grow traffic by 15% to 67m. Significantly lower
 oil prices has encouraged us to restart hedging and Ryanair is now 90% hedged
 for the first 3 quarters of the coming year at much lower prices than
 competitors. If oil prices remain at current levels then our full year fuel bill
 will be EUR450m lower. We expect operating costs per passenger (excluding fuel)
 will also fall by approx. 5% and we intend to use these reductions in both fuel
 and other unit costs to drive fares materially lower. Lower fares will help
 Ryanair to grow traffic, maintain high load factors and, despite a deep
 recession - gain traffic from high fare competitors. While we have limited
 visibility on bookings we expect that a combination of a deep recession, weaker
 sterling and our own capacity growth will cause average fares to fall by between
 15% to 20% this year to as little as EUR32 per passenger.
On the basis of these fuel and yield expectations (which carry a heavy health
 warning) we currently expect that after tax profits for the coming year will at
 least double to a range of between EUR200m to EUR300m.
At a time when all of our competitors are suffering increasing costs, Ryanair
 uniquely is reducing unit costs in the current year. In this recessionary
 environment we intend to continue to offer European consumers, more competition,
 more choice, and even better value just like Aldi, Lidl, IKEA and McDonalds are
 doing in their respective industries. The dramatic traffic declines, stalled
 growth, and increased losses being suffered by our competitors will inevitably
 lead to further consolidation and fewer players at the end of this recession.
 Ryanair as the largest of the big four European carriers expects to
 significantly increase traffic, market share, and profits this year, while at
 the same time substantially reducing average fares for the benefit of our
 passengers, our people and shareholders".

Announcing these results Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
"Despite the global recession and record high oil prices Ryanair's lowest
 fare/lowest cost airline services again delivered traffic growth and
 profitability which demonstrates the fundamental strength of the Ryanair model.
 The principal highlights of the past year included:-
- After tax profit of EUR105m.
 - Traffic growth of 15% to 59m.
 - 18 net new aircraft (year end fleet 181 Boeing 737-800 aircraft).
 - 6 new bases at Alghero, Birmingham, Bologna, Bournemouth, Cagliari, and
 Edinburgh.
 - 223 new routes.
 - BAA airport monopoly broken up - Gatwick, Stansted and Edinburgh to be sold.
 - EU's Charleroi state aid decision dismissed by the European courts.
 - Passenger service further improved (No 1 on time major airline).
To deliver a Net Profit of EUR105m (although a disappointing EUR376m decline over
 last year's figure) was a robust performance during a year of record high oil
 prices when our fuel bill jumped by EUR466m (up 59%). In a year when most airline
 competitors announced large losses, Ryanair's profit exceeded our previous
 guidance. Average fares (due to the global recession and weaker Sterling) fell
 by 8% to EUR40, but this was largely funded by a 3% reduction in non fuel
 operating costs. The recession and declining consumer confidence is proving to
 be good for Ryanair's growth, as millions of passengers switch to our lower
 fares. All of our major competitors have reported material reductions in
 short-haul capacity and traffic. Ryanair will continue to lower fares to
 stimulate traffic growth, maintain high load factors and win more shorthaul
 traffic from our high fare competitors.
Ancillary revenues grew by 23% to EUR598m. We have now achieved our target of 20%
 of revenues (18% last year) one year ahead of schedule. Our onboard mobile
 telephony service trial commenced at the end of February and is now available on
 over 40 aircraft based in Ireland and Italy. Early indications prove that
 consumers love this service and penetration rates continue to rise. While
 initial revenues will be small, we believe that in-flight communications will
 make a meaningful contribution to ancillary profit growth in future years if
 this trial proves successful.
Fuel costs rose by EUR466m (59%) to EUR1.257bn and accounted for 45% of our
 operating costs compared to 37% in fiscal '08. We have taken advantage of recent
 falls in jet fuel prices to extend our hedging programme for FY'10 to 90% for
 the first 3 quarters at an average price of approx. $620 per tonne and 5% of Q4
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Full Year Results
 at approx. $490 per tonne. Assuming that we hedge the balance of our fuel
 requirements at current rates this would reduce our fuel bill by approx. EUR450m
 in FY'10. Excluding fuel, other operating costs fell by 3% on a per passenger
 basis.
Competitive Environment
 Most of our competitors are reporting material traffic and yield declines which
 has led to greater losses and an accelerating trend of airline
 closure/consolidations. European air travel is increasingly dominated by 4 major
 airlines comprising 3 high fare airline groups (led by Air France, BA &
 Lufthansa) and one very large low fares airline, Ryanair. Ryanair's continued
 fare cuts and traffic growth has seen us overtake Lufthansa's traffic figures in
 March 09 to finally become Europe's largest airline by both traffic and market
 cap. We are determined to ensure that Europe's consumers and airports will
 always have real competition and a choice over high fare, fuel surcharging
 airlines like Air France, BA, and Lufthansa.

Airport Costs
 Significant reductions in capacity across Europe has led to Ryanair being
 besieged by many large and small airports who are aggressively competing with
 lower costs and more efficient facilities to attract Ryanair to grow in their
 markets. This recession is delivering real cost benefits for Ryanair through the
 combination of a weaker dollar, lower interest rates, lower airport costs, and
 lower unit costs. It is also encouraging passengers to become much more price
 sensitive which is why they are switching to Ryanair's low fares and unbeatable
 customer service over all other competitors.
The break-up of the UK's BAA airport monopoly has finally forced the welcome
 sale of Gatwick and Stansted airports in London, and Edinburgh in Scotland. This
 breakup cannot come a moment too soon for UK consumers and airport users. We
 need real competition between these UK airports to deliver efficient additional
 capacity at much lower cost than the over specified Taj Mahal palaces preferred
 by the high charging BAA monopoly. Regulation of the BAA by the clueless
 economists of the CAA over the past 20 years has utterly failed to protect
 consumers, yet Harry Bush has again approved further unjustified airport price
 increases in Stansted at a time when competitor airports across the UK and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Full Year Results
 Europe are lowering prices. The sooner this inept and hopelessly out of touch
 regulator is booted out the better.
Travel Taxes
 In Ireland our tourism industry is collapsing with 600,000 fewer passengers
 using the DAA's high cost Dublin airport in the first quarter of 2009 alone.
 This tourism collapse will accelerate following the 30 March introduction of the
 government's suicidal EUR10 tourist tax. Ireland is now facing a loss of over 3m
 passengers at its airports in 2009.
We again call on the Irish government to remove this self defeating tourist tax,
 reduce the DAA's monopoly charges, make Ireland a more competitive tourist
 destination again, and reverse this year's collapse in visitor numbers. The
 Belgian and the Dutch governments have already realised that tourism cannot be
 stimulated by taxing tourists and have sensibly decided to scrap their tourist
 taxes.
The Greek and Spanish governments are also reducing airport charges, in some
 cases to zero, and we believe that the Irish government should follow their
 example and scrap this tourist tax before even further damage is done to Irish
 tourism.
Regulatory Developments
 In Ireland we continue to suffer under an incompetent aviation regulator who has
 now been criticised by the Irish government's own appeals panel for 'passive
 regulation'. We again call on this useless and clueless regulator to resign and
 let competing terminals at Dublin airport lead to lower costs where Mr Guiomard
 has hopelessly failed.
We achieved a landmark victory in December when the ECFI dismissed the EU
 Commissions 2004 Charleroi state aid decision. This is not just a success for
 Ryanair but also for European consumers, and regional airports who can now work
 actively with Ryanair to increase their traffic and business using the EU's
 approved Market Economy Investor Principal (MEIP) to enable them to lower costs
 and grow profitability. We also welcome the recent EU Commissions decision on
 the illegal state aid (in the form of discounted domestic airport charges)
 received by Air France at French regional airports and we hope that these
 monies, which amount to over EUR1bn, will be repaid in due course by Air France.
Aer Lingus
 As we advised at the time we withdrew our EUR1.40 per share offer in January, we
 believe that Aer Lingus faces a bleak future as a loss making, subscale,

Accelerated depreciation of EUR51.6m (2008: EUR10.6m) arose on aircraft disposed in
 the financial year 2009 and agreements to dispose of aircraft in financial year
 2010, to write these aircraft down to their recoverable amounts when disposal
 occurs, thus leading to no gain or loss on disposal.
Impairment charge:  During the year the Group recorded an impairment charge of
 EUR222.5m (2008: EUR91.6m) on its Aer Lingus shareholding reflecting the decline in
 the Aer Lingus share price from EUR2.00 per share at March 31, 2008 to EUR0.59 per

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Operating and Financial Overview
Introduction
For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") all figures
 and comments are by reference to the adjusted results excluding the exceptional
 items referred to below.  A reconciliation of the results for the period under
 IFRS to the adjusted results is provided on page 5.
Exceptional items in the year ended March 31, 2009 amounted to EUR274.1m (2008:
 EUR90.2m) consisting of a EUR222.5m (2008: EUR91.6m) impairment of the Aer Lingus
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Full Year Results -7-
 shareholding and an accelerated depreciation charge of EUR51.6m (2008:
 EUR10.6m) on aircraft disposed in the financial year 2008 and 2009 and
 for agreements to dispose of aircraft  in the financial year 2010 and a gain of
 EUR12.1m in the year ended March 31,2008 on aircraft disposed in the financial
 year 2008.
Adjusted profit excluding exceptional items decreased by 78% to EUR105.0m in the
 year ended March 31, 2009. Including exceptional items the loss for the year
 amounted to EUR169.2m compared to a profit of EUR390.7m in the year ended
 March 31, 2008.
 Summary year ended March 31, 2009
Profit after tax decreased to EUR105.0m compared to EUR480.9m in the year
 ended March 31, 2008 primarily due to a 59% increase in fuel costs.  Total
 operating revenues increased by 8% to EUR2,942.0m, slower than the 15% growth in
 passenger volumes, as average fares declined by 8% due to the absence of Easter
 in the year, weaker euro/sterling exchange rates and aggressive fare
 promotions.  Ancillary revenues grew by 23% to EUR598.1m during the year.  Total
 revenue per passenger, as a result, decreased by 6%, whilst the Load
 Factor decreased by 1 point to 81% during the year.
Total operating expenses increased by 29% to EUR2,797.7m, primarily due to the
 increase in fuel prices, the higher level of activity and increased costs
 associated with the growth of the airline.  Fuel, which represents 45% of total
 operating costs compared to 37% in the previous year, increased by 59% to
 EUR1,257.1m due to the increase in the price per gallon and an increase in the
 number of hours flown, offset by a positive movement in the US dollar exchange
 rate versus the euro.  Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 3% and including fuel
 they rose by 12%.  Operating margin fell by 15 points to 5% whilst operating
 profit decreased by 74% to EUR144.2m.
Net margin fell from 18% at March 31, 2008 to 4% for the reasons outlined above.
Adjusted earnings per share for the year was 7.10 euro cent compared to earnings
 per share of 31.80 euro cent in the year ended March 31, 2008.
Gross cash increased by EUR108.6m to EUR2,278.2m. The Group generated cash from
 operating activities of EUR413.1m and a further EUR314.2m from the sale of 16 Boeing
 737-800 aircraft which funded the higher fuel costs, a EUR46.0m share buy back
 programme and capital expenditure incurred during the year.  Capital expenditure
 of EUR702.0m largely consisted of advance aircraft payments for future aircraft
 deliveries and the delivery of new Boeing 737-800 aircraft.  Long term debt, net
 of repayments, increased by EUR131.9m during the year.The Group had net debt of
 EUR120.2m at year end compared to net debt of EUR96.9m at March 31, 2008.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis year ended March 31, 2009
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Full Year Results -7-
Adjusted profit after tax, decreased by 78% to EUR105.0m primarily due to higher
 fuel costs.  Total operating revenues grew by 8% due to a 15% increase in
 passenger numbers and strong growth in ancillary revenues compared to the year
 ended March 31, 2008. This however, was partially offset by a decrease in fares
 due to the absence of Easter, the adverse impact of the movement in
 euro/sterling exchange rates and aggressive fare promotions.  The growth in
 revenues was significantly offset by increases in fuel prices, which rose by 59%
 to EUR1,257.1m.  Operating margin, as a result, fell by 15 points to 5%,
 whilst operating profit decreased by 74% to EUR144.2m.
Total operating revenues increased by 8% to EUR2,942.0m, slower than the 15%
 increase in passenger volumes to 58.5m.  Total revenue per passenger decreased
 by 6% due to the 8% fall in average fares.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 5% to EUR2,343.9m reflecting a 15% rise
 in traffic due to increased passenger numbers on existing routes and the
 successful launch of new routes and bases. This is offset by an 8% decrease in
 average fares due to the absence of Easter, lower baggage penetration rates and
 the adverse impact of the movement in euro/sterling exchange rates and
 aggressive fare promotions.Load factor decreased by 1 point to 81%, compared to
 the year ended March 31, 2008.
Ancillary revenues continue to outpace the growth of passenger volumes and rose
 by 23% to EUR598.1m.  This performance reflects the growth of onboard sales,
 non-flight scheduled revenues, and other ancillary products.
Total operating expenses rose by 29% to EUR2,797.7m primarily due to the 59%
 increase in fuel prices, the higher level of activity, and the increased costs
 associated with the growth of the airline.
Staff costs increased by 8% to EUR309.3m.  Excluding a one off charge of EUR7.0m,
 for a staff share option grant, in the prior year ended March 31, 2008, staff
 costs increased by 11%.  This primarily reflects a 21% increase in average
 employee headcount to 6,369. Cabin crew, who earn lower than the average salary,
 accounted for the vast majority of the increase in employee headcount.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 24% to EUR204.5m. This reflects, net of
 disposals, an additional 10 aircraft added to the fleet or a 16% increase in the
 weighted average number of lower cost 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this year
 compared to the year ended March 31, 2008.
Fuel costs rose by 59% to EUR1,257.1m due to the higher cost of fuel in the period
 and a 13% increase in the number of hours flown.
Maintenance costs increased by 18% to EUR66.8m due to a 23% increase in the number
 of leased aircraft from 35 to 43 and increased costs arising from increased line
 maintenance activity at new bases.  These increases were partially offset by
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Full Year Results -7-
 a stronger euro versus US dollar exchange rate during the period.
Marketing and distribution costs decreased by 26% to EUR12.8m due to tight control
 on expenditure and the increased focus on internet based promotions.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 8% to EUR78.2m, which is lower than the 23%
 increase in the number of leased aircraft from 35 to 43 compared to the year
 ended March 31, 2008, reflecting the positive impact of lower lease
 rentals obtained and a stronger euro versus US dollar exchange rate.
Route charges rose by 11% to EUR286.6m due to an increase in the number of sectors
 flown offset by the positive impact of a stronger euro versus sterling.
Airport and handling charges increased by 12% to EUR443.4m due to a 15% increase
 in passenger volumes, offset by lower costs at new airports and bases launched
 and savings achieved on handling costs.
Other expenses increased by 14% to EUR139.1m, which is lower than the growth in
 ancillary revenues, due to improved margins on some existing products and cost
 reductions on some indirect costs.
Operating margin declined by 15 points to 5% due to the reasons outlined above
 and operating profits have decreased by 74% to EUR144.2m compared to the year
 ended March 31, 2008.
Finance income decreased by 10% to EUR75.5m primarily due to the impact of lower
 interest rates resulting from reductions in interest rates and the prudent
 placement of funds with highly rated and guaranteed financial institutions.
Finance expense increased by 34% to EUR130.5m primarily due to the drawdown of
 debt to part finance the purchase of new aircraft and the restructuring costs
 incurred in relation to aircraft disposals.
Foreign exchange gains during the period of EUR4.4m are primarily due to the
 impact of changes in the US dollar exchange rate against the euro.
Tax credit during the period of EUR11.3m is primarily due to a deferred tax asset
 in respect of losses recognised.
Balance sheet
 Gross cash increased by EUR108.6m to EUR2,278.2m. The Group generated cash from
 operating activities of EUR413.1m and a further EUR314.2m from the sale of 16 Boeing
 737-800 aircraft which funded the higher fuel costs, a EUR46.0m share buy back
 programme and capital expenditure incurred during the year. Capital expenditure
 of EUR702.0m largely consisted of advance aircraft payments for future aircraft
 deliveries and the delivery of new Boeing 737-800 aircraft.  Long term debt, net
 of repayments, increased by EUR131.9m during the year.The Group had net debt of
 EUR120.2m at year end compared to net debt of EUR96.9m at March 31, 2008.
 Shareholders' Equity at March 31, 2009 decreased by EUR77.1m to EUR2,425.1m,
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Full Year Results -7-
 compared to March 31, 2008 due to the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for
 derivative financial investments, pensions and stock option grants, offset by
 the EUR46.0m share buy back and the post exceptional loss of EUR169.2m in the year.

 Glorious Victory for German Consumers over German Screenscraper Website
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (28th May 09) celebrated a
 glorious victory in the Hamburg Courts which upheld an earlier decision (of the
 Regional Court of Hamburg) to grant Ryanair an injunction preventing Vtours, an
 unauthorised ticket-tout website, from scraping Ryanair's website to resell its
 flights at inflated prices in breach of Ryanair's Terms of Use.
The Higher Hamburg Court found that the scraping of Ryanair's website to resell
 Ryanair's flights at higher fares is unlawful in Germany. Vtours now remains
 banned from reselling Ryanair's flights at inflated prices or with hidden
 charges to German consumers.
Ryanair allows "price comparison only" websites to access its timetable and
 pricing information, for an annual charitable donation of EUR100, in order to
 compare Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares with those of high fare, fuel
 surcharging, competitor airlines.  Ryanair continues to fight against all
 ticket-tout websites, like Vtours, which are selling Ryanair flights to
 consumers at inflated prices.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Glorious Victory over German Screenscraper Website
"Ryanair celebrates a glorious victory for German consumers as it confirms that
 the European courts support Ryanair's fight to protect passengers against
 overcharging screenscraping ticket-touts.  These website ticket-touts mislead
 passengers by unlawfully reselling Ryanair's flights with hugely inflated fares
 and hidden charges.  Ryanair will continue its fight against these unlawful and
 misleading ticket-touts in the interest of passengers and today's decision of
 the Hamburg Courts is a victory for all German consumers and visitors.
"Vtours, like all other cost comparison websites, can enter into a licence
 agreement with Ryanair, for a charitable donation of just EUR100, which will allow
 it to legally provide consumers with genuine cost comparisons and guarantee that
 passengers are not subjected to sneaky hidden charges".

 29 May 2009
 RYANAIR RESPONDS TO AER LINGUS' REJECTION OF ITS AGM PROPOSALS TO REDUCE THE
 BLOATED FEES PAID TO AER LINGUS' NON EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN AND DIRECTORS
Ryanair today (29th May 09) expressed its disappointment that the Board of Aer
 Lingus has recommended rejection of its two AGM proposals to cut Aer Lingus'
 bloated Non-Exec Chairman and Directors fees. Ryanair believes that these two
 resolutions are clearly in the best interests of all Aer Lingus shareholders.
 This latest rejection of Ryanair's proposals by the Board of Aer Lingus proves
 again that it is controlled by the Government and trade unions, leaving Ryanair
 - its largest shareholder - with no influence whatsoever. Ryanair pointed out
 that its resolutions, if passed, will reduce the fees paid to the Aer Lingus
 Board from EUR730,000 in 2008, to a still substantial EUR141,000 in 2009, thereby
 reducing Aer Lingus' costs by almost EUR600,000 to the benefit of Aer Lingus'
 profits, its share price and shareholder value.
Ryanair said that this was the fifth time over the past 2 years that Aer Lingus
 has ignored or rejected proposals from Ryanair, its largest (29.8%) shareholder,
 which included:
1.  Ryanair's Aug'07 call for an EGM on the closure of the profitable Shannon base.
 2.  Ryanair's Mar'08 call for Aer Lingus to lower fares to stimulate traffic growth
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Response To Aer Lingus
 and profits.
 3.  Ryanair's May'08 call for Aer Lingus to scrap its unfair long-haul fuel
 surcharges which were damaging Aer Lingus' long-haul traffic.
 4.  Ryanair's Feb'09 request that secret multi-million euro senior executive
 resignation bonuses at Aer Lingus should not be agreed in future without
 shareholder approval.
 5.  Ryanair's June'09 ordinary resolutions to reduce Aer Lingus' bloated Non Exec
 Director (and Chairman's) fees which have increased five fold over the past 2
 years from EUR141,000 in 2006 to EUR730,000 in 2008.
The irrational and illogical determination of the Aer Lingus Board to
 dismissively reject every proposal from its largest shareholder (as illustrated
 above) even when these sensible proposals would boost Aer Lingus profits and
 share price confirms again that Ryanair has no influence whatsoever or control
 over the Board of Aer Lingus whose only policy appears to consist of taking the
 opposite course to that recommended by Ryanair regardless of the damage done to
 Aer Lingus' shareholder value.
Since the Aer Lingus Board continues to be controlled and run by the Irish
 Government and the trade unions (who between them have appointed the entire Aer
 Lingus Board) who have presided over an 80% collapse in its share price over the
 past two years (from over EUR3 in 2007 to under EUR0.60 in May 2009) Ryanair has
 accepted this reality and today announced that it has given a proxy over its
 29.8% share of votes at the AGM in favour of the Minister for Transport, Mr Noel
 Dempsey on the two resolutions covering Non-Exec fees.
The effect of this action is to allow the Minister for Transport - on his own -
 to decide whether:
1.  Fees of EUR140,000 p.a. to a Non Executive Chairman who attends approx 9 Board
 meetings a year (a cost of over EUR15,000 per Board meeting) is reasonable or
 justified,
 2.  Fees of EUR36,000 p.a. to a Non Exec Director such as (fat cat trade union boss)
 David Begg (at a cost of EUR4,000 per Board meeting) is reasonable or justified in
 the context of a company whose market cap has fallen to just over EUR300m, and
 which reported losses of EUR108m in 2008 and has warned of increased losses in
 2009.
Ryanair said it does not expect these individuals to work for free. It simply
 believes that a majority of non Government and non trade union shareholders
 would share its view that Non Executive Chairman's fees of EUR35,000 p.a. and Non
 Executive Directors fees of EUR17,500 p.a. (which is what was paid to Aer Lingus
 Directors in 2006, and is what is currently paid to Directors of other Irish
 Government Semi-States like the DAA Plc) is fair and reasonable for the limited
 time involved and the shareholder value destruction delivered by this Board at
 Aer Lingus.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Response To Aer Lingus
Speaking today, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"We have decided on this course of action today in order to avoid conflict at
 Aer Lingus' AGM on 5th June next. Giving a proxy over Ryanair's votes in favour
 of the Minister for Transport on the two resolutions concerning the bloated fees
 paid to Aer Lingus' Chairman and Non Executive Directors simply recognises the
 reality that Aer Lingus is controlled and run by the Government and the trade
 unions, which is why shareholder value is being destroyed. These recent events
 sadly confirm that Ryanair has no control or influence whatsoever over this
 failing, loss making airline.
"The fact that the Board of Aer Lingus has refused to reduce its Directors' fees
 to the level they were at just over  two years ago in 2006, in recognition of
 the urgent need to reduce costs in the face of rising losses, or to bring them
 into line with Directors' fees paid by other comparable semi-state companies
 (such as the Dublin Airport Authority plc) leaves the Board of Aer Lingus with
 little or no credibility when it comes to negotiating further cost
 reductions with its work force and trade unions in order to restore Aer Lingus
 to profitability.
"Sadly the Board of Aer Lingus seem more concerned to defeat every reasonable
 Ryanair proposal to improve profitability and shareholder value, in order to
 repeatedly prove that Ryanair has no influence or control over Aer Lingus. The
 rejection of these latest proposals is yet another sign of lamentable leadership
 at Aer Lingus and demonstrates once again that its Chairman and Board are
 completely out of touch with reality and have no regard whatsoever for the
 reasonable concerns of its shareholders or shareholder value.
 "With Ryanair's votes in his pocket, the Minister for Transport can now alone
 decide whether fees of over EUR15,000 per Board meeting are reasonable in the case
 of Aer Lingus' Non Exec Chairman or fees of EUR4,000 per Board meeting are
 reasonable in the case of Aer Lingus' Non Executive Directors, all of whom are
 either Government appointees or trade union appointees like ICTU boss David
 Begg.
"If the Minister for Transport, Noel Dempsey, abstains or votes to protect these
 bloated Directors fees, then he too will have zero credibility when it comes to
 negotiations with Aer Lingus' trade unions and its workers on the
 significant cost reductions and productivity improvements necessary to return
 Aer Lingus to profitability and restore shareholder value.
"Ryanair will be represented at Aer Lingus' AGM next Friday and will be
 addressing a series of questions to Aer Lingus Chairman, Colm Barrington and
 Board. We welcome Aer Lingus' recent (22 May) confirmation that Ryanair is
 welcome to attend the AGM and that we can ask anything we like. We look forward
 to taking Aer Lingus up on this invitation".

AER LINGUS RECOMMENDS SHAREHOLDERS
 VOTE AGAINST RYANAIR RESOLUTIONS
Dublin, London, 26 May 2009: Aer Lingus Group plc (the "Company") notes that
 shareholders will shortly receive a letter from Ryanair Limited ("Ryanair")
 regarding the forthcoming Aer Lingus Annual General Meeting ("AGM") on Friday, 5
 June, 2009. The letter refers to three resolutions which Ryanair intend for
 shareholders to vote on at the meeting. The Aer Lingus Board advises Aer Lingus
 shareholders to ignore the assertions in Ryanair's letter that the resolutions
 it will propose are in the best interests of the Company and all its
 shareholders.
One of the three resolutions cannot be put to a shareholder vote at the AGM
 because it does not form part of the ordinary business of the meeting and would
 first require the passing of a special resolution amending the Company's
 Articles of Association. Although this position has been explained to Ryanair,
 it continues to insist it will try to propose this resolution at the AGM; an
Aer Lingus Group PLC AGM Statement
 action which is clearly intended to disrupt the meeting. This resolution will be
 ruled out of order on the day of the AGM.
The Company will allow Ryanair to propose two of the resolutions submitted by
 Ryanair as part of the ordinary business of the AGM. These resolutions relate to
 the fixing of the ordinary remuneration of the Directors. In summary, Ryanair
 have indicated they will propose resolutions regarding:
1.  A proposed reduction in the remuneration of the Chairman from EUR175,000 to
 EUR35,000; and
 2.  A proposed reduction in the remuneration of Non Executive Directors from EUR45,000
 to EUR17,500.
Aer Lingus' non-executive Directors are remunerated by way of Directors' fees.
 For the year ended 31 December 2008, non-executive Directors' fees were set at
 EUR45,000 per annum and the Chairman's fees were set at EUR175,000. Other than the
 Chairman of the Audit Committee, no Aer Lingus Director receives additional fees
 for their participation on Board Sub-Committees, unlike many other public
 companies.
On 3 February 2009, all Aer Lingus Board members voluntarily reduced their fees
 by 20%, resulting in annual Directors' fees of EUR36,000 and an annual Chairman's
 fee of EUR140,000 for 2009.
Aer Lingus' non-executive Directors' and Chairman's fees, prior to the 20%
 reduction, were in line, if not lower than fees at comparable Irish public
 companies. This does not factor in the high level of Board activity (including
 regular consultation outside of scheduled Board meetings); the fact that fees
 are not supplemented for participation on Board sub-committees; or, the recent
 20% fee reduction. In addition, comparisons with Directors' fees prior to the
 Company's IPO are not valid given the increase in Directors' duties and
 responsibilities following the Company's public listing, the introduction of
 IFRS' and the EU Transparency Directive.
Accordingly, the Aer Lingus Board recommends that shareholders attending the AGM
 vote AGAINST the Ryanair resolutions. If shareholders do not intend to attend
 the AGM in person, the Aer Lingus Board recommends that such shareholders
 appoint the Chairman of the meeting as proxy to vote on their behalf at the
 meeting at his discretion. The Chairman intends to vote AGAINST these
 resolutions.

 21 May 2009
 RYANAIR SEEKS CUTS IN AER LINGUS BLOATED DIRECTORS FEES AND ASKS THAT
 SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE ANY FUTURE MULTI MILLION EURO EXECUTIVE RESIGNATION BONUSES
Ryanair, which is the largest minority shareholder in Aer Lingus (with a 29.8%
 stake), today (21st May 09) confirmed that it has written to all of Aer Lingus'
 shareholders including the Minister for Transport and the Aer Lingus Employee
 Share Option Trust (ESOT) seeking their support for the three resolutions which
 Ryanair proposes to raise at Aer Lingus' forthcoming AGM on 5th June next.
 Ryanair believes that these resolutions are reasonable and appropriate in light
 of (a) the recent collapse of Aer Lingus' share price (from over EUR1.30 in
 January to under EUR0.60 in May), (b) the enormous losses reported by Aer Lingus
 for 2008 (EUR108m after tax), (c) its forecast increased losses in 2009, (d) the
 decline in Aer Lingus' short-haul traffic (down 6% in Q1) and long-haul traffic
 (down 15% in Q1) and (e) the recent (11 March) admission by Aer Lingus that its
 net cash of EUR803m last December is "expected to be circa EUR400m" by the end of
 2009.
Ryanair believes that the Chairman and Board of Aer Lingus cannot credibly lead
 any cost reduction or efficiency programme without first reducing the bloated
 Non Executive Directors fees (over EUR700,000 in 2008), which are excessive and
 unjustified in a small company whose market capitalisation has fallen to just
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Seeks Cut In Aer Lingus Directors Fees
 over EUR300m, and where these Directors already enjoy the considerable benefit of
 free first class air travel on Aer Lingus and other worldwide airlines.
Ryanair believes that the fees of some EUR200,000 p.a. payable to Aer Lingus' Non
 Exec Chairman are unwarranted and unjustified and pointed out that Ryanair's
 Chairman receives no fee whatsoever for his non-exec role. Ryanair also pointed
 out that the EUR45,000 Non Exec fee paid to other Aer Lingus Directors including
 David Begg (Boss of the ICTU trade union) is EUR13,000 more than the average
 industrial wage in Ireland.
Ryanair has proposed 3 resolutions at the 5th June AGM as follows:
1.  That Mr Barrington's Non Exec Director fees be reduced from some EUR200,000 to the
 EUR35,000 fee paid by Aer Lingus to its previous Non Executive Chairman in 2006.
 2.  That the EUR45,000 Non Exec Directors fee be reduced to the EUR17,500 per
 person paid by Aer Lingus to its Non Exec Directors in 2006.
 3.  That the multi million euro resignation bonuses agreed in late 2008 for Aer
 Lingus' Chief Executive (Mr Mannion) and 5 other Senior Executives should not be
 repeated for future Senior Executives without seeking the prior approval of Aer
 Lingus shareholders in general meeting.
Aer Lingus have agreed that resolutions 1 and 2 may be put to the 5 June AGM.
 However Aer Lingus have to date refused to allow resolution 3 to be put to the
 AGM.  Ryanair believes this is an attempt to deny shareholders openness and
 transparency. Ryanair will be calling on other Aer Lingus shareholders including
 the Minister for Transport and the ESOT to support these resolutions which would
 reduce bloated Directors fees, would promote transparency, shareholder democracy
 and good corporate governance on the issue of future multi-million euro bonuses
 for Senior Executives.  It is important in a company like Aer Lingus, which has
 gone through 10 Chief Executives over the past 16 years that the company and its
 shareholders do not suffer large bonus payments to (frequently) departing Senior
 Managers simply because they choose to resign.
Ryanair will also be using the forthcoming AGM to ask Aer Lingus Chairman, Mr
 Barrington for a progress report on his campaign announced on 11 December last,
 when he "vowed to find a friendly investor who will take a majority stake in the
 airline".  Shareholders will wish to know whether Mr Barrington (who has
 presided over a 50% collapse in Aer Lingus' shareholder value over the past 4
 months) has any credible plans to restore Aer Lingus' share price and increase
 shareholder value.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"We believe that the three resolutions we have proposed are in the best
 interests of Aer Lingus, its stakeholders and shareholders. If there are to be
 more cost cuts and efficiency at Aer Lingus, then the Non Executive Chairman and
 Directors should lead from the front. The current level of Directors fees are
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Seeks Cut In Aer Lingus Directors Fees
 bloated, excessive and unjustified in a small company which has a market
 capitalisation of just over EUR300m and where those Directors already receive the
 substantial benefit of free first class travel on Aer Lingus and other airlines
 worldwide.
"We believe that the Minister for Transport, the ESOT, as well as other Aer
 Lingus shareholders will also support Ryanair's call for reduced Directors fees
 as well as transparency and openness in any future resignation bonuses for
 Senior Executives.  Since both the Minister for Transport and the ESOT were
 vociferous in their objection to the recent multi million euro resignation
 bonuses payable to Messrs Mannion and others when they were exposed in January,
 we believe there is an overwhelming majority of shareholders who support our
 resolution that any similar resignation bonuses should not be agreed without
 first being approved by shareholders.
"We will also be using the AGM to ask the Chairman and Board of Aer Lingus to
 explain why they were guiding "a profit overall in 2008" and "enhanced
 profitability in 2009" at the end of December, when just 10 weeks later on 11th
 March they reported an enormous loss of EUR108m for 2008 and warned of
 significantly increased losses in 2009. Mr Barrington and his Board have much to
 do if they are to restore shareholder trust and confidence and improve
 shareholder value in Aer Lingus, and we hope they'll use the forthcoming 5th
 June AGM and these three simple resolutions as a good place to start".

RE: AER LINGUS AGM - 5 JUNE 2009
Dear Fellow Aer Lingus Shareholder,
I am sure you are, like us, concerned at the recent performance of the Chairman
 and Board of Aer Lingus who have presided over another disastrous collapse in
 the share price from over EUR1.30 in January to less than EUR0.60 in May. Aer
 Lingus' market cap has now fallen to just over EUR300m. Under this Board and
 Management the airline in recent months is losing money, losing cash, losing
 traffic on both its short and long-haul routes and has launched two bases in
 Belfast and Gatwick both of which are we believe, loss making.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Seeks Cut In Aer Lingus Directors Fees
We find it impossible to reconcile the airline's current plight with the
 positive and upbeat assurances given to shareholders by the Chairman, Mr
 Barrington and the Board in their letter of 22nd December last. In that letter
 Mr Barrington gave shareholders the following assurances:
1.  "We expect to achieve profit overall in 2008".      - but they reported an
 after-tax loss of EUR108m just 10 weeks later.
 2.  "We expect Aer Lingus to enhance profitability in 2009"- but they warned of
 substantial increased losses for 2009 just 10 weeks later.
 3.  "Our short-haul business continues to grow".-but their short-haul traffic has
 declined by 6% in Q1 '09.
 4.  "Our long-haul business continues to grow".- but their long-haul traffic has
 declined by 15% in Q1 '09.
 5.  "Aer Lingus has net cash of EUR803m".    - but on 11 March they warned that year
 end net cash is expected to be circa EUR400m.
It is clear that if Aer Lingus is to prosper and recover this calamitous loss of
 shareholder value - as well as the trust of its shareholders - then it needs
 radical action to, cut costs, increase efficiency, return its long-haul and
 short-haul businesses to growth, and to find a strong airline partner which can
 preserve the Aer Lingus brand as a separate identity. Mr Barrington himself
 "vowed" last December "to find a friendly investor who will take a majority
 stake in the airline". Perhaps he will update shareholders at the AGM on the
 progress of his quest?.
Ryanair believes that the Chairman and Board of Aer Lingus cannot credibly lead
 this cost reduction programme unless they significantly reduce their bloated
 Directors fees which are excessive and inappropriate for a small company with a
 market cap of some EUR300m, facing substantially increased losses in 2009. In
 2008, Aer Lingus' Non Executive Chairman received fees of over EUR200,000, and its
 Non Executive Directors (many of whom are Government or trade union appointees)
 received fees of EUR45,000 each, which is EUR13,000 more than the average industrial
 wage in Ireland.
 At the forthcoming AGM on 5th June next, Ryanair has proposed three
 resolutions. The first of these would see the Non Executive Chairman's fees
 reduced from around EUR200,000 p.a. to the EUR35,000 p.a., which is what the Non
 Exec Chairman's fee was in 2006. The second would reduce the Non Exec Directors
 fees from EUR45,000 to EUR17,500 per person, which again is where it was in 2006.
 Aer Lingus has agreed that these resolutions may be voted on at the AGM as part
 of the ordinary business of the meeting.
Ryanair has also proposed a third resolution which would we believe avoid a
 repetition of the secret multi million euro resignation bonuses put in place for
 the previous Chief Executive, Mr Mannion and 5 other Senior Executives in late
 2008. These excessive resignation bonuses were condemned by Aer Lingus Board
 members including Mr Barrington and Mr Begg, and by other major shareholders
 including the Irish Government and the ESOT when they were revealed in January.

 They were surrendered by those executives during the Ryanair takeover, thereby
 saving Aer Lingus and its shareholders any exposure to future multi million
 bonus claims.
We believe that Aer Lingus shareholders at the AGM should be allowed to express
 their views on these multi million resignation bonuses and have asked the
 company to allow shareholders to vote on this third resolution which doesn't in
 any way restrict compensation for executives - as wrongly claimed by the Aer
 Lingus Board - but will require any similar multi million bonuses to be approved
 in advance by shareholders.
The company has refused to allow this resolution by trying to hide behind
 spurious legal arguments, and so we are taking the unusual step of writing to
 all Aer Lingus shareholders, copying you with this correspondence (attached) and
 asking you to support our call for this issue to be raised at the AGM, so that
 shareholders can be allowed to vote on it. Given the publicly stated position of
 the Minister for Transport and the ESOT, we believe there is a substantial
 majority of shareholders in favour of the company not entering into any similar
 million euro termination bonuses again and we believe that in the interests of
 good corporate governance the company should allow shareholders to vote
 democratically on this issue. We regret that your Chairman and the Board wish to
 prevent all shareholders from discussing these excessive bonuses openly,
 transparently and democratically at the AGM.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Seeks Cut In Aer -2-
As a minority shareholder, Ryanair cannot influence or control the outcome of
 these resolutions. All we can do is propose that they be considered by all Aer
 Lingus shareholders at the AGM. In light of (a) the crisis currently facing Aer
 Lingus, (b) the failure of the Chairman and Board to deliver on any of the
 assurances they gave to shareholders in their 22 Dec Defence Document, (c) the
 collapse of the company's share price to under EUR0.60, and (d) the destruction of
 shareholder value as Aer Lingus' market cap falls to just EUR300m, we believe that
 these proposed resolutions reducing bloated Directors fees, as well as seeking
 transparency for any future Senior Executive termination bonuses, are fair,
 reasonable and in the best interests of the company and all its shareholders.
We would welcome your support for these resolutions at the forthcoming AGM.
 Please do not sign your voting proxy in favour of the Chairman. Instead we hope
 you will attend the AGM and work with all other shareholders to try to build a
 better, prosperous and viable future for Aer Lingus.
Yours faithfully
Michael O'Leary

Additional shareholder resolutions for AGM
Dublin, London, 21 May 2009: Aer Lingus Group plc (the "Company") today
 announces that a shareholder has informed the Company of its intention to
 propose the following two resolutions at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting
 on Friday, 5 June 2009. A shareholder is entitled to propose a resolution at the
 Annual General Meeting if it concerns one of the items of ordinary business of
 the meeting (and this includes the fixing of the ordinary remuneration of
 Directors).
The shareholder, Ryanair Limited, has indicated that it intends to propose the
 following resolutions which will form part of the ordinary business of the AGM
 as they concern the fixing of the ordinary remuneration of the Directors:-
1.IT WAS RESOLVED THAT in light of the Company's stated need to significantly
 reduce costs (and in particular in the recent "transformational programme" which
 required employees to accept job cuts and pay cuts) that the remuneration of the
 Non Executive Chairman should be reduced from EUR175,000 (in 2007), back to the
Aer Lingus Group PLC AGM Statement
 amount of EUR35,000 earned by the previous Non Executive Chairman in 2006, and
 that any future increases in the remuneration of the Non Executive Chairman
 should not exceed the general level of pay increase agreed between the Company
 and its employees.
2.IT WAS RESOLVED THAT in light of the Company's ongoing need to significantly
 reduce costs (and particularly the recent "transformational programme" which
 required employees to accept job cuts and pay cuts) that the remuneration of the
 Non Executive Directors should be reduced from EUR45,000 (in 2007), back to the
 amount of EUR17,500 earned by each Non Executive Director in 2006, and that any
 future increases in the remuneration of the Non Executive Directors should not
 exceed the general level of pay increase agreed between the Company and its
 employees.
Aer Lingus' non-executive Directors are remunerated by way of Directors' fees.
 For the year ended 31 December 2008, non-executive Directors' fees were set at
 EUR45,000 per annum and the Chairman's fees were set at EUR175,000. Other than the
 Chairman of the Audit Committee, no Aer Lingus Director receives additional fees
 for their participation on Board Sub-Committees.
On 3 February 2009, all Aer Lingus Board members voluntarily decided to reduce
 their fees by 20%, resulting in annual Directors' fees of EUR36,000 and an annual
 Chairman's fee of EUR140,000 for 2009.
The Aer Lingus Board believes that the existing non-executive Directors' fees
 and Chairman's fees are reasonable having regard to the high level of Board
 activity and the increase in Directors' responsibilities since the IPO. The Aer
 Lingus Board therefore recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST the above
 resolutions at the Annual General Meeting of the Company on Friday, 5 June 2009.

 Ryanair's 5.3M April passengerS double those of BA
 12% INCREASE IN RYANAIR'S PASSENGER NUMBERS
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fare airline today (6th May 09) confirmed April
 traffic of 5.3million, a 12% increase over April 2008 and more than double
 British Airways' declining April traffic.
Ryanair's continued growth proves that passengers prefer Ryanair's low fares
 over the high fares and fuel surcharges imposed by flag carriers, such as Air
 France, British Airways and Lufthansa.
The following are Ryanair's passenger and load factor statistics for April 2009:
+---------------+-----------+-----------+----------+
 |               |  Apr 08   |  Apr 09   |Increase  |

 2.  Represents the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 's 5.3M April Passengers Double those of BA
 available to passengers.
Stephen McNamara, Head of Communications, said:
"We continue to grow our monthly traffic as passengers switch to Ryanair's
 guaranteed lowest fares and no fuel surcharge from BA's high fares, unfair fuel
 surcharges and flight delays.
"Ryanair carried 5.3 million passengers in April, an increase of 12%, and while
 some growth can be attributed to Easter falling later this year April was
 another strong month of growth at the expense of high cost airlines who see
 passengers continue to switch to Ryanair. Ryanair now carries more than double
 the monthly traffic of BA proving, yet again, that the self titled "World's
 favourite airline" isn't even Britain's favourite anymore".

Ryanair's issued share capital consists of 1,473,547,148 Ordinary Shares of

 RYANAIR TAKES DELIVERY OF ITS 200th NEW BOEING 737-800 AIRCRAFT
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (25th Mar 09) celebrated the
 delivery of its 200th brand new Boeing 737-800 Next Generation aircraft. This
 year Ryanair's fleet will carry 67 million passengers as it continues to grow
 traffic with its guaranteed lowest fares, which now average just EUR34, as
 passengers save billions by switching to Ryanair from high cost fuel surcharging
 flag carrier airlines.
 Ryanair celebrated its 200th aircraft by releasing 1million EUR10* seats for
 travel across its European network in April, May and June. These low fares are
 now available for booking on www.ryanair.com.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
"We are delighted to take delivery of our 200th brand new Boeing aircraft. The
 total value of the Ryanair fleet is now over $12billion. We are proud to operate
 the youngest, greenest and most fuel efficient fleet of any major European
 airline.
"This aircraft will help us to grow to 67 million passengers this year as we
 continue to lower fares and guarantee no fuel surcharges, which is why so many

 Ryanair Welcomes Competition Commission's DECISION TO break-up THE BAA MONOPOLY
 Renews call for harry bush to resign OR BE SACKED
Ryanair, Britain's largest airline, today (19th Mar 09) welcomed the Competition
 Commission's final report which recommends the break-up of the BAA Monopoly's
 control over London's three main airports.  This groundbreaking report will
 result in Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted finally being freed to compete against
 each other to provide low cost better services at lower prices for airport users
 and consumers.
The Competition Commission's report confirms that the BAA Airport Monopoly has
 been bad for competition and bad for consumers and highlights the abject failure
 of the CAA to properly or effectively regulate the BAA monopoly.
Ryanair believes that regulator Harry Bush's position is now untenable and he
 should resign or be sacked.
Ryanair's Director of Legal & Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan, said:
"Ryanair welcomes the Competition Commission's final report and fully endorses
 its findings including its justified criticism of the CAA regulatory regime
 which has repeatedly failed passengers and airlines for so many years.   The BAA
 Monopoly has long ignored the needs of its airline users and the travelling
Ryanair Holdings PLC Welcomes Decision to Break-Up BAA Monopoly
 public and provided inefficient, gold plated and overly expensive facilities,
 encouraged by an ineffectual and incompetent regulator, the CAA.
"Monopolies don't work.  The BAA monopoly has done enormous damage to
 competition and the travelling public and Ryanair welcomes the CC's
 recommendation to break-up the BAA Airport Monopoly. Competition in the airline
 industry has delivered huge benefits for consumers and this will now be
 replicated at the three main London airports.  Ryanair looks forward to working
 with the new owner of Stansted and we call on the Competition Commission to
 ensure the early sale of both Gatwick and Stansted Airports.
"We once again call on failed regulator Harry Bush to resign as the CC report
 once again highlights his abject failure to effectively regulate the out of
 control and abusive BAA Monopoly.  Regulatory failure such as his warrants and
 deserves the sack as his regulatory incompetence has led to higher costs and
 abject services for the travelling public, which has directly led to the
 collapse of passenger numbers at the BAA airports over the past year".

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES MORE ROUTE AND FLIGHT CUTS AT DUBLIN AS GOVT OWNED IAA RAISES
 FEES 12%
Ryanair, Ireland's largest airline, today (16th Mar 09) announced a further
 series of route, flight and frequency cuts at Dublin Airport from July, as the
 impact of the EUR10 tourist tax and other Government price hikes cause numbers at
 Dublin to decline - down 12% in February alone.  Ryanair confirmed that these
 latest cuts were being implemented in response to the decision of the Government
 owned Irish Aviation Authority to increase ATC charges by 12% this summer, at
 more than 12 times the rate of inflation.
From July 2009 Ryanair will close four routes from Dublin to Basel, Doncaster,
 Oporto and Teesside, and reduce frequencies on eight more routes from Dublin to
 Aberdeen, Biarritz, Billund, Bournemouth, Carcassonne, East Midlands, Malaga and
 Rome (Ciampino). These cuts will result in one additional based aircraft (five
 in total) being switched from high cost Dublin Airport to a low cost Ryanair
 European base in July.
Ryanair's latest cuts at Dublin for summer 2009 will see:
*  A 22% cut in Dublin based aircraft (from 22 to 17).
Ryanair Holdings PLC Route And Flight Cuts At Dublin Airport
 *  A 20% cut in weekly rotations (from over 700 to under 600).
 *  A 23% drop in Ryanair's Dublin traffic (10.8m to 8.3m pax in 2009/10).
 *  The loss of 50 Dublin based jobs (250 in total).
 *  Further cuts in Ryanair's Dublin winter schedule will be announced later.
Announcing these further Dublin cuts today, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"This latest 12% increase in Government owned ATC charges at Dublin Airport is
 another nail in the coffin of Irish tourism.  These increases have been
 rubber-stamped yet again by Ireland's useless Aviation Regulator, Cathal
 Guiomard, proving again how useless he is and that he should be sacked. How can
 any regulator approve a 12% increase in ATC charges in a year when inflation
 will be negative?  This is impossible to justify.
"These IAA increases show that this gutless Government has no interest in Irish
 tourism.  Over the last three months traffic at Dublin Airport has declined by
 12%, with 500,000 fewer passengers, and this collapse will get worse from April
 when the Government EUR10 travel tax and these IAA increases come in.
"These massive Government cost increases prove that this Government is
 devastating the tourism industry. Already this year the DAA has increased
 airport charges, increased wheelchair charges, is double charging for kiosk
 installation and now the Government and its clueless Regulator allows the IAA to
 raise ATC charges by 12%, when inflation is at 0%.
"At a time when Governments and airports all over Europe are reducing costs in
 order to stimulate tourism, the Irish Government is raising costs and
 introducing taxes which can only damage tourism. Ryanair calls again on the
 Irish Government to promote tourism by scrapping the travel tax and sacking
 Cathal Guiomard, the useless and incompetent Aviation Regulator."

 RYANAIR CALLS ON AER LINGUS TO APOLOGISE FOR MISLEADING SHAREHOLDERS AND THE
 STOCK EXCHANGE ABOUT ITS LOSSES IN 2008 AND AGAIN IN 2009
Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline today (Wednesday, 11th March 2009) called
 on Aer Lingus Chairman Colm Barrington to apologise for misleading Aer Lingus
 shareholders and the Stock Exchange in its 22 December Defence Document -
 published just 9 days before the year end - in which Aer Lingus made the
 following claims - which have now been proven to be untrue by the enormous
 losses announced this morning by Aer Lingus for 2008 and again in 2009.
In Aer Lingus's 22 December Defence Document - published just 10 weeks ago,
Aer Lingus Chairman Colm Barrington made the following false claims:
1.  "Despite these extremely challenging conditions we expect to achieve profit
 overall in 2008".
This morning Aer Lingus announced an after tax loss of EUR108m for 2008, clearly
 proving that Aer Lingus misled shareholders and the Stock Exchange in its
 Defence Document.
2. "We expect that significantly reduced fuel prices and a number of management
Ryanair Holdings PLC Response to Aer Lingus Results
 cost reduction initiatives will enable Aer Lingus to continue to enhance
 profitability in 2009 and beyond".
In this morning's results Aer Lingus confirmed that "In 2009 Aer Lingus will
 experience a larger operating loss than in 2008 and the Group is unlikely to
 meet its previous guidance of a pre-tax profit in 2009".  This morning's results
 confirm that Aer Lingus misled its shareholders and the Stock Exchange about its
 claims to "enhance profitability in 2009".
3."Aer Lingus is and will be profitable".
This morning's confirmed losses in 2008 and larger operating losses in 2009
 proves that these claims - made just 10 weeks ago - were false.
4."Our long-haul business also continues to grow".
Aer Lingus' recent traffic figures which show a consistent reduction in monthly
 long-haul traffic of over 10% proves this Defence Document claim was also false.
Ryanair called today on Aer Lingus Chairman Colm Barrington and its Board to
 explain to shareholders why they continue to preside over an enormous collapse
 in shareholder value and why they recommended rejection of Ryanair's EUR1.40 per
 share offer just 10 weeks ago, at a time when they were presiding over enormous
 losses in 2008, increased operating losses in 2009, and a share price which has
 collapsed by more than 50% from EUR1.40 to less than 70 cents today.
Speaking today Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"Today's results from Aer Lingus prove conclusively that the Chairman Colm
 Barrington, Board and Management of Aer Lingus misled shareholders and the Stock
 Exchange in their Defence Document of just 10 weeks ago. Shareholders are
 entitled to ask why there is no mention in today's results about restoring or
 improving shareholder value.  It would appear that the Board and Management of
 Aer Lingus care more about lining their own pockets with excessive and
 unjustified Director fees and multi million euro resignation bonuses for failed
 management than they do about growing Aer Lingus, delivering profitability or
 shareholder value.
"Irish taxpayers are entitled to ask the Department of Transport why they
 rejected Ryanair's EUR1.40 offer and claimed that "The EUR1.40 offer for Ryanair
 greatly undervalues Aer Lingus", when just ten weeks later the taxpayer
 investment in Aer Lingus has collapsed by more than 50%. What does this say
 about the Department of Transport's financial judgement?
"We intend to submit formal complaints to the London and Irish Stock Exchange,
 the Takeover Panel and the Financial Services Regulator about the patently false
 claims and misleading advice given by Aer Lingus to shareholders in its 22
 December Defence Document.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Response to Aer Lingus Results
"Consumers can celebrate Aer Lingus's continuing losses and failure as Ryanair
 this morning released 108,000 free seats - 1,000 seats for every EUR1m after tax
 losses announced by Aer Lingus this morning - for travel in March and returning
 in the first week of April. These will be the last free flights on Ryanair from
 Ireland before the Government introduces its crazy EUR10 tourist tax in Ireland".

 standard rate per tonne), which increased by 50.0% year on year. Average yields
 reduced by 8.0%, while tonnes decreased by 3.1%. Short haul tonnage continued to
 grow, reaching 4,536 (an increase of 34.8%), while long haul tonnage dropped
 marginally, by 1.4%, to 23,408 tonnes.
Operating costs
In 2008, the Group made significant progress on cost reduction initiatives,
 particularly in relation to new agreements on maintenance and staff costs, which
 will deliver savings in 2009 and beyond. In 2008, cash operating unit cost
 before employee profit share and net exceptional items and excluding fuel
 continued to fall, dropping from 4.19c to 3.80c per available seat kilometre.
 Total operating costs before the employee profit share and net exceptional items
 increased by 14.9% to EUR1,375.0m, primarily as a result of higher oil prices and
 increased operations.
The largest increase was in fuel costs, rising by EUR148.0m (58.4%) to EUR401.3m.
 Fuel represented 29.2% of operating costs before employee profit share and net
 exceptional items in 2008, up from 21.2% in 2007.
Staff costs, which represent 24.3% of operating costs before employee profit
 share and net exceptional items (2007: 25.7%), rose by 8.8% to EUR334.3m, while
 the average numbers employed increased from 3,905 in 2007 to 4,035 in 2008.
Airport charges represent 17.7% of operating costs before employee profit share
Aer Lingus Group PLC Preliminary Results 2008 -3-
 and net exceptional items (2007: 18.5%) and increased by 9.7% through a
 combination of higher passenger volumes and increased charges by the airports
 served.
During the year, the Group concluded new contracts with a number of world-class
 suppliers on the provision of maintenance services. This resulted in the
 reduction in maintenance cost provisions to reflect the new contracts agreed in
 the year. Maintenance costs decreased from EUR82.6m in 2007 to EUR74.4m in 2008.
Employee profit share
There was no charge for employee profit share in 2008, as minimum return targets
 were not met. A charge of EUR9.8m was made in respect of the employee profit share
 for 2007.
Financing income and costs
Finance income fell by 6.6% to EUR60.9m with the decrease driven by reducing
 interest rates. While borrowings increased by 47.3% in the year, interest
 payable decreased by 2.5% to EUR22.0m again, due to reducing interest rates.
Net exceptional items
Net exceptional losses of EUR140.9m were recorded in 2008. This consisted of
 EUR117.5m in relation to staff cost restructuring, EUR5.9m relating to the defence
 of a takeover bid by Ryanair Holdings plc and EUR17.5m compensation payments under
 the Programme for Continuous Improvement.
Balance sheet
The Group continues to maintain a strong balance sheet position. Net cash has
 reduced to EUR653.9m (2006: EUR757.0m) as a result of operating losses and
 significant capital expenditure. Following the amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7
 Reclassification of Financial Assets, the Group reclassified as loans and
 receivables, all the financial assets that had previously been classified as
 available-for-sale, with effect from 1 July 2008. This resulted in a reduction
 of net cash of EUR9.6m at 31 December 2008.
Capital expenditure during the year totalled EUR115.4m, of which EUR109.1m related
 to flight equipment. This primarily relates to aircraft deposits for future
 deliveries, capitalised maintenance costs and costs of the A330 retrofit
 programme.
Fuel and currency hedging
To achieve greater certainty on costs we manage our exposure to fluctuations in
 the price of fuel and foreign currency through hedging. At 31 December 2008, our
 estimated fuel requirements for 2009 were hedged as follows:

At 28 February 2009, our estimated fuel requirements for the remainder of 2009
 were hedged as follows:
+------------------------------------------+----------+----------+

Our major foreign currency exposure is to the US dollar. At 31 December 2008,
 our estimated US dollar trading requirements for 2009 were fully hedged at an
 average rate of EUR1=$1.48. In addition, we had purchased 72% and 23% of our
 estimated US dollar trading requirements for 2010 and 2011 at EUR1=$1.48 and $1.42
 respectively.
At 28 February 2009, we had fully hedged our estimated trading requirements for
 US dollars for the ten months to 31 December 2009 at EUR1=$1.48. In addition, our
 forward purchases of US dollars comprised 76% of the estimated trading
 requirements for 2010 at a rate of EUR1=$1.48, and 24% of the estimated trading
 requirement for 2011 at EUR1 = $1.42.  Future developments
Aer Lingus made significant progress in 2008 towards it primary objective to
 deliver profitable growth over the medium-term. These initiatives include the
 delivery of a significant and sustained reduction to operating costs, the
 establishment of a new international base and new long-haul partnership with
 United Airlines.
Cost reduction
 On 8 December 2008, Aer Lingus announced that it was on track to deliver at
 least EUR52.0m in annual staff cost savings following the positive agreements with
 the principal employee unions. The restructuring agreements with staff are
 delivering significant changes in work practices and reductions in operating
 costs. These savings, combined with a significant reduction in the cost of fuel,
 underpin Aer Lingus' ability to deliver growth over the medium-term. The central
 objective of the cost reduction programme is to ensure Aer Lingus maintains a
 competitive cost base that can underpin the profitable growth of the airline. In
 addition, cost reductions in the areas of professional fees, marketing and
 distribution, and airport and other costs will also be delivered in 2009.
Aer Lingus Group PLC Preliminary Results 2008 -3-
 Savings will continue to be achieved from the contracts agreed with new
 suppliers for the provision of maintenance services concluded during 2008.
Gatwick base
 In December 2008, the Group announced the opening of its new international base
 at London Gatwick Airport. The base is the Group's first outside the island of
 Ireland and will position Aer Lingus for profitable growth in Europe's largest
 aviation market. Aer Lingus will initially locate four Airbus A320 short haul
 aircraft at Gatwick from April 2009 and will operate services to Malaga, Munich,
 Nice, Vienna, Dublin, Knock, Faro and Zurich. Within 12 months the new base is
 expected to grow to 8 aircraft with the potential for up to 2.5 million
 passengers a year.
Long haul initiatives
 On 1 November 2008, Aer Lingus commenced a code-share arrangement with United
 Airlines. The codeshare agreement covers all six of Aer Lingus' US gateways and
 delivers significant benefits for Aer Lingus customers, by providing access to
 over 200 additional destinations in the US market on the United Airlines
 network. US customers also benefit from greater access to destinations in
 Ireland and, through Aer Lingus' extensive short-haul network, to destinations
 in the UK and Continental Europe. The United Airlines flight code is placed on
 all Aer Lingus transatlantic flights to and from Shannon and Dublin.
The relationship with United Airlines has recently been further extended. On 22
 January 2009, an innovative extension of the relationship was announced on
 select long haul services between Europe and North America. This partnership
 will capitalise on the growth opportunities presented by the Open Skies
 agreement between the European Union and the United States by opening new
 transatlantic non-stop services. The partners will launch a service between
 Washington, Dulles and Madrid, which will be available for sale from April 2009,
 and will commence daily operations from March 2010. It is anticipated that
 additional routes may be made available -for sale during 2010 to
 commence operation in Summer 2011.

 in-flight mobile phone service initially onboard 20 of its (mainly) Dublin based
 aircraft.   This is the first step in fitting Ryanair's entire fleet of over 170
 aircraft to allow all passengers to make and receive mobile calls and texts on
 all Ryanair flights.
Passengers on Ryanair's 20 OnAir enabled aircraft can now make and receive voice
 calls at (non- EU) international roaming rates (EUR2-EUR3 pm) text messages (50c+)
 and email (EUR1-EUR2) using their mobile phones, BlackBerrys and other
 smartphones.These price tariffs are set by each mobile service provider and are
 subject to each customer's individual price plan.
The service will initially be available to "02" and "Vodafone" customers and to
 customers of over 50 other mobile phone operators across Europe.  At the launch
 OnAir confirmed that it is working with other Irish mobile operators ("3" and
 "Meteor") to ensure that their customers can also keep in touch with the office,
 family and friends when travelling.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR & ONAIR LAUNCH INFLIGHT PHONE SERVICE
Michael O'Leary said:
"Today's launch by Ryanair and OnAir is the first step to offering in-flight
 mobile phone services onboard our entire fleet of over 170 aircraft over the
 next 18 months.  This service will allow passengers to keep in touch with the
 office, family or friends.  We expect customer demand for this service to
 grow rapidly and hope that customers of all Irish mobile operators will soon be
 able to call or text home from 30,000 feet to tell loved ones of yet another on
 time Ryanair flight."
Benoit Debains, CEO of OnAir, said,
"Mobile OnAir is the most advanced in-flight communications service in the world
 and this European fleet-wide rollout marks a real milestone in aviation. We are
 proud to work with Ryanair, the world's largest international scheduled airline,
 and to provide their 67 million passengers with access to this new technology
 which will enable them to send and receive emails, text messages, download
 attachments and make and receive calls just as they would on the ground.'

Note to Editor
How it works:
To access Mobile OnAir, passengers simply switch on their GSM-enabled phones
 when cabin signs indicate that the Mobile OnAir service may be used. As long as
 their mobile service provider has a roaming agreement with OnAir, passengers are
 able to use GSM and GPRS services as seamlessly as they would on the ground.
Phones or BlackBerry-type devices connect to an antenna onboard the aircraft and
 a mini-GSM network. The mini-GSM network sends the calls and data via an
 Inmarsat SwiftBroadband satellite link to the ground where it connects to the
 OnAir ground infrastructure. This then routes the calls and data to public
 networks (mobile and fixed network operators).
About pricing:
Pricing is set by your home mobile operator and varies from operator to
 operator. As a general rule, text messages will cost about EUR0.50, calls will
 cost between EUR2.00 and EUR3.00 per minute, and smart phone email sessions between
 EUR1.00 and EUR2.00 if there are no major file transfers (100 KB of data). Please
 check with your home mobile operator for specific rates. Switching on your
 mobile phone and receiving text messages is free. Communications costs will
 appear in the normal way on the bill.

Ryanair WELCOMES COMMISSION'S DECISION NOT TO APPEAL POSITIVE CHARLEROI RULING
 RYANAIR AGAIN CALLS ON DG TRANSPORT TO "PUT CONSUMERS FIRST"
 Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (19th Feb) welcomed reports
 that the European Commission will not appeal the European Court's decision in
 Ryanair's successful challenge of the Charleroi case. In December 2008, the
 Court annulled the Commission's 2004 decision which wrongly found that Ryanair
 received state aid from Charleroi or the Walloon region. The Court found that
 the Commission had failed to properly apply the crucial Market Economy Investor
 Principle (MEIP), which allows public companies to offer the same commercial
 terms as their private competitors. In the five years since the Commission's
 decision Charleroi Airport has proven to be remarkably successful, again
 demonstrating that the Commission got it wrong in its 2004 decision.
 Ryanair also again called on the Commission to drop the 8 other State Aid cases
 that were brought against similar regional and secondary airports in Alghero,
 Aarhus, Bratislava, Frankfurt Hahn, Hamburg Lubeck, Pau, Berlin Schonefeld and
 Tampere and to focus instead on the real and blatant breaches of the state aid
 rules by Europe's biggest flag carriers, such as the multi-billion euro bailout
 of Alitalia by the Italian Government, the EUR500m. state aid by the Austrian
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR WELCOMES DECISION ON CHARLEROI RULING
 Government to Lufthansa as a 'sweetener' to persuade them to buy Austrian
 Airlines, and the most recent illegal bailout of SAS in Scandinavia.
Welcoming the Commission's decision not to appeal, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary
 said:
"We are happy but not surprised at the Commission's decision not to appeal what
 was a thorough vindication of the low cost airport model and Ryanair's agreement
 with Charleroi Airport. The Commission simply got it wrong, as has been
 subsequently proven by the huge success of Charleroi Airport.  Charleroi airport
 has been profitable in each of the past six years, which disproves the
 Commission's original claim that Charleroi would be loss making for the term of
 the Ryanair contract. Charleroi is now a model for low cost airport development
 around Europe.
"We hope that the Commission will now drop their other baseless state aid cases
 against similar regional and secondary airports, most of which have been brought
 to the Commission by larger competitor airports and airlines who are trying to
 block competition and lower fares.  These investigations are all based on the
 same flawed reasoning that has now been annulled in the Charleroi decision."
"We look forward to meeting with the Transport Commissioner to discuss our
 shared objective of "putting consumers first" so that European's largest
 international airline can begin working closely with the Commission to promote
 and develop more low fare flights, more choice and competition, more regional
 and secondary airports, more jobs, and much more traffic and tourism growth for
 the benefit of European integration and all of Europe's citizens. This is
 particularly important at a time of unprecedented economic crisis when flag
 carrier airlines are reducing services and increasing prices to European
 consumers".

 GARTMORE IRISH GROWTH FUND PLC
INTERIM MANAGEMENT STATEMENT (UNAUDITED)
This interim management statement covers the period from 1 October 2008 to 31
 December 2008. It has been produced for the sole purpose of providing
 information to the Company's shareholders in accordance with the requirements
 of the UK Listing Authority's Disclosure and Transparency Rules. It should not
 be relied upon for any other purpose.
Investment Objective
The Company seeks to provide shareholders with long-term capital growth through
 investment in quoted companies which are either incorporated in the Republic of
 Ireland or Northern Ireland or, if elsewhere, derive the majority of their
 turnover or profits from the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland.
Manager's Comments
The period under review saw unprecedented upheavals in national and
 international financial markets. The sub-prime crisis in the United States has
 resulted in major bank failures, and the American government was forced to make
 strenuous efforts to stop contagion which, at one stage, appeared to threaten
 systemic failure of the American banking system.
That contagion had obviously spread to the United Kingdom, Ireland, Iceland and
Gartmore Irish Interim Management Statement
 other European countries. In the UK and Ireland the governments found it
 necessary to nationalise failing financial institutions and to recapitalise
 major banks.
Many closed-ended funds saw steep falls in their net asset values and we
 suffered with the rest. In the quarter ended 31 December 2008 the Company's
 diluted net asset value fell by 13.3% by comparison with a fall of 19% in the
 ISEQ Index (adjusted for sterling). Published economic data in the UK and
 Ireland continues to deteriorate and the prospects of dividend cuts and of
 falling earnings have worsened.
Our holding in CRH, Ireland's biggest building materials group, performed
 better than most other holdings, in part due to the anticipation of increased
 infrastructure spend in the United States at the initiative of a new President.
 The group reported challenging conditions across its major markets, but adhered
 to its 2008 profit forecasts citing encouraging performance from its operations
 in Poland and the Ukraine.
A major investment in the packaging products manufacturer Smurfit Kappa has so
 far proved somewhat disappointing, adversely affecting the Company's returns.
 Despite this we believe that, given the group's broad international operating
 base, the improvements which have been made in operating efficiencies are not
 reflected in the current share price and that there is considerable scope for
 positive earnings surprises.
We trimmed our investment in Aer Lingus during the quarter on concerns that the
 airline is losing market share in its long-haul business. However, we acquired
 a new stake in Ryanair in the belief that it will enjoy significant benefits
 from the steep fall in the oil price, and that its continuing success in
 winning business from higher-cost airlines offers scope for profits to beat
 market forecasts.
We are naturally cautious on the near-term economic outlook in Ireland, but, in
 time, factors such as the country's low rate of corporation tax and favourable
 demographics should support the longer-term case for investment. At the stock
 level, despite the disappointments so far, we believe that a number of the
 multi-nationals are trading at attractive levels and that our holdings in
 companies such as CRH, Smurfit Kappa and Dragon Oil should deliver good returns
 for investors prepared to look beyond short-term volatility.
Gearing
The Company's loan and overdraft facilities expired during the period under
 review and we found the terms offered for renewal unacceptable. In the
 difficult financial environment which prevailed for most of last year we had

 facilities continue in the expectation that they may be required when the
 markets turn. Meanwhile, should he wish to do so, the Manager may obtain geared
 exposure in the portfolio through the use of derivatives, such as contracts for

 on payment of a margin, rather than of the full market price of the relevant
 stock.

 12 February 2009
 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES FLIGHT & JOB CUTS AT DUBLIN AIRPORT, AS IRISH GOVT EUR10 TAX
 DEVASTATES TOURISM
Ryanair, Dublin airport's largest airline, today (Thurs 12th Feb 09) announced
 details of its first ever Summer season flights and traffic cut backs at Dublin
 Airport, as the combination of high and rising DAA charges, allied to the Irish
 Government's crazy decision to impose a EUR10 tourist tax from 30th March next is
 set to decimate traffic and tourism through Dublin Airport.
Ryanair confirmed that the combination of the DAA's high costs and third rate
 facilities has already caused traffic at Dublin to collapse this winter, with
 DAA's monthly traffic now running some 9% behind the previous year. This is a
 loss of 150,000 passengers per month or almost 2 million passengers annually.
 Ryanair believes this traffic decline will accelerate on 30th March next when
 the Irish Government's idiotic EUR10 tourist tax is introduced. This will make
 Dublin and Ireland a higher cost destination and render it uncompetitive against
 other European cities/countries, where airports are lowering costs and
 Governments are welcoming tourists, not taxing them.  Ryanair's traffic
 continues to grow at airports that do not impose such idiotic taxes as
 demonstrated by Ryanair's 11% traffic growth in January 2009.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Flights, Job Cuts at Dublin due to Govt. Tax
Ryanair today announced substantial reductions in its base at Dublin Airport for
 the summer 2009 schedule including:
*  A 20% cut in Dublin based aircraft (22 to 18).
 *  A 18% cut in weekly rotations (from over 700 to under 600).
 *  A 20% drop in Ryanair's Dublin traffic from 10.8m to 8.7m pax in 2009/10.
 *  The loss of 200 jobs among pilots, cabin crew and engineers.
 *  Further cuts in Ryanair's Dublin winter schedule will be announced later.
Announcing these Dublin cutbacks, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"The combination of the DAA's high costs, and awful facilities has already
 created a traffic collapse at Dublin Airport this winter (December traffic fell
 by 9% with 150,000 fewer passengers). The decision by the Irish Government to
 introduce a flat rate EUR10 tourist tax from April is nothing less than "tourism
 suicide". This travel tax when introduced (appropriately on April Fools Day)
 will exacerbate the traffic decline at Dublin, as price sensitive visitors will
 avoid Ireland and choose other lower cost destinations.
"Ryanair has repeatedly called for this tax to be made fairer by making it a
 percentage of the air fare paid, or alternatively why not scrap the tax
 altogether and generate equivalent savings by closing quangos like Tourism
 Ireland and Fáilte Ireland which spend over EUR150m p.a., but deliver few if any
 visitors.
"This travel tax has already failed in the UK and Dutch markets, where they
 caused traffic declines and sadly the Irish Government's tourist tax is doomed
 to a similar failure. This Government must realise you can only promote tourism
 by welcoming visitors, not taxing them.
"The catastrophic collapse in Irish traffic and tourism over the coming year
 will add more weight to the growing calls for the break up of the DAA monopoly,
 the dismissal of the useless Irish Aviation Regulator and further evidence, if
 it were needed, that the Department of Transport's sole policy continues to be
 the protection of its high cost, inefficient semi-state monopolies at the
 expense of Irish consumers and visitors.
"As in Shannon, these cuts can and will be reversed if the Government's suicidal
 EUR10 tourism tax is reversed on or before 30th March next".

 RYANAIR REDUCES SHANNON BASE, AS UNFAIR EUR10 GOVT. TRAVEL TAX TURNS
 OFF TOURISTS
RYANAIR SHANNON TRAFFIC TO FALL 40% FROM 1.9M TO 1.2M P.A.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Thurs, 5 Feb)
 confirmed that the Government's new and unfair EUR10 travel tax is
 already having a damaging impact on forward bookings from 30th March
 next.  This EUR10 tourist tax, which has already caused traffic
 declines in the UK and Holland when previously introduced, is
 devastating forward bookings in Shannon, because in many cases it
 exceeds the air fare paid by many passengers on Ryanair's low fares
 routes from Shannon.  Ryanair regrets that this 100% rate of tax
 leaves it with no alternative other than to reduce its aircraft
 numbers, routes, flights and traffic to/from Shannon from 30th March.
Ryanair confirmed this morning that from 30th March, it will:
*          Reduce its Shannon based aircraft numbers from 6 to 4 in
 Summer'09.
 *          Reduce its route network at Shannon from 30 to 25.
 *          Cut its weekly Shannon flights from 136 to 116 flights.
 *          Reduce its Shannon traffic from 1.9m to 1.2m in the first
 year of this unfair EUR10 tourist tax.
 *          Reduce its Shannon jobs from over 300 to less than 200.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Reduces Shannon Base as Unfair EUR10 Govt. Travel Tax Turns Off Tourists
These cuts will result in over 100 Ryanair jobs at Shannon being
 transferred to other bases.  The loss of 700,000 passengers will also
 give rise to the loss of approximately 700 support jobs in and around
 Shannon Airport.
Ryanair condemned the Irish Government's insane decision to levy a
 flat rate EUR10 tourist tax on passengers travelling from the West of
 Ireland, at fares which are frequently less than EUR10 one way.
 Ryanair called again on the Irish Government - even at this late
 stage - to cancel this insane and stupid tax which will devastate
 traffic and tourism numbers in Ireland in 2009.
Speaking today in Shannon, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"Having invested millions of euro and sustained large losses growing
 Ryanair's base in Shannon over the past 4 years from 400,000 to 1.9m
 passengers (at a time when Aer Lingus and many other airlines pulled
 out) this insane EUR10 visitor tax will devastate traffic at Shannon.
 The only reason why many of the 1.9m passengers travel with Ryanair
 to/from Shannon is because of Ryanair's exceptionally low fares, many
 of which are less than EUR10.  This Government's decision to impose a
 travel tax of more than 100% on these price sensitive visitors is
 insane and simply "tourism suicide".
"It is not as if the Irish Government hasn't seen examples from other
 EU countries of the devastating failure this travel tax will have on
 visitor numbers.  The UK's traffic has already fallen 10% and Dutch
 visitors by even more since they introduced an equally stupid and
 self defeating tourist tax.  Ryanair again calls on the Government to
 scrap this suicidal tax measure and make greater savings by
 withdrawing funding from useless quangos like Tourism Ireland (EUR40m)
 or Fáilte Ireland (over EUR60m).
"Irish tourism can only succeed if Ireland is a low cost
 destination.  Irish tourism has been the beneficiary of Ryanair's
 extremely low fares and no fuel surcharges for many years, but now
 this Government seems determined to kill the tourism industry with
 this insane EUR10 visitor tax.  Ryanair will do its utmost to maintain
 the maximum number of flights and traffic at Shannon, but we cannot
 do so when the Government taxes are greater than our ticket prices,
 which makes Shannon and the West of Ireland totally uncompetitive
 against the many other low cost - non taxed - destinations across
 Europe."

Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Third Quarter Results
Announcing these results Ryanair's, CEO Michael O'Leary said:
Results
 "Our Q3 loss of EUR102m was disappointing, but in line with expectations, and was
 almost entirely due to a EUR136m increase in fuel costs. Average fares (due to
 recession and weaker Sterling) fell by 9% to EUR34, but this decline was largely
 funded by a 3% reduction in non fuel operating costs. The general economic
 environment remains extremely difficult, as the recession saps consumer
 confidence, but this is proving to be good for Ryanair's traffic growth, as more
 and more passengers switch to Ryanair's lowest fare lowest cost model. Many of
 our competitors have in recent months reported short-haul traffic falls, while
 Ryanair continues to grow. We will continue to lower fares to maintain our
 traffic growth and high load factors.
"Ancillary revenues grew by 19% to EUR132m, and now account for 22% of revenues
 (19% last year). We expect our onboard mobile telephony service to become
 operational at the end of February on 20 Dublin based aircraft, and this trial,
 which will last for 6 months should be extended to some 40 aircraft by the end
 of the summer. We expect initial revenues to be small, but believe that
 in-flight communication will be a strong source of ancillary revenue growth in
 future years.
"Q.3 fuel costs rose by 71% to EUR328m and accounted for 47% of our operating
 costs (37% in Q.3 '08). We have taken advantage of recent falls in jet fuel
 prices to extend our hedging position for FY'10 to 75% of Q.1 and Q.2, and 50%
 of Q.3, at an average price of $650 per tonne, which is 38% lower than the
 average $1,050 per tonne paid in the current year. If our average cost in FY'10
 finishes at $650 per tonne, it will reduce our fuel bill by approx. EUR500m in the
 next fiscal year. Excluding fuel, other operating costs in Q.3 fell by 3% on a
 per passenger basis due to improved unit cost performances on staff costs,
 airport and handling costs, and depreciation.
Competitive Environment
 "The rate of airline closures and consolidation across Europe continues to
 accelerate. Recent developments include the Air France/KLM 25% stake in
 Alitalia, the EU's approval of the Clickair/Vuelling merger in Spain and the
 January bankruptcy of the Lithuanian carrier FlyLAL. As losses increase in 2009,
 more EU airlines will close and/or consolidate, as many lack the cash reserves
 to survive next winter.
 This consolidation is hastening the emergence of four large European airlines,
 comprising three high fare fuel surchargers, led by Air France, BA and
 Lufthansa, and one very large low fare airline, Ryanair. Ryanair's success is
 good news for Europe's consumers and airports, as we will continue to offer
 choice, competition, growth and even lower prices.
Airport Costs
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Third Quarter Results
 "The dramatic cuts in flights and capacity by many of Europe's flag carriers has
 created traffic collapses at many of Europe's larger airports. This is creating
 enormous opportunities for Ryanair, as these airports compete to reduce charges
 in order to attract Ryanair's growth and to develop low cost facilities to take
 advantage of Ryanair's quick turnarounds and our improved web check-in
 facilities. This movement towards lower cost, more efficient airports in Europe
 is welcome, even if it is 20 years too late.
"In the UK, we welcome and strongly support the CAA's recent recommendation that
 the high cost BAA airport monopoly be forced to sell Gatwick and Stansted
 airports in London and Edinburgh in Scotland to finally introduce much needed
 competition and speed up the delivery of low cost, efficient, additional
 capacity, something that the BAA monopoly has repeatedly failed to do. The CAA
 Regulator remains hopelessly inadequate and has recently approved another round
 of cost increases at Stansted at a time when airports all over Europe are
 lowering prices. The sooner real airport competition replaces the incompetent
 CAA Regulator in the UK, the better.
"In Ireland, we welcomed the Government report in December which confirmed
 Ryanair's view that the DAA's Terminal 2 is "considerably over-sized" and that
 the risk of this over-sizing should be borne by the DAA monopoly and not by
 passengers. We hope that the equally incompetent Aviation Regulator in Ireland
 will now act upon the recommendations of this Government panel having been
 correctly criticised for "passive regulation". The fact that Dublin Airport's
 traffic is now in freefall (down 9% in December) exposes the damage being done
 to Irish tourism and the wider economy by this high cost, inefficient,
 Government owned airport monopoly. We call again for the Government to allow a
 competing terminal to be developed at Dublin Airport. Ryanair would be willing
 to build and pay for such a facility which will relieve passengers from the high
 costs, long walks and even longer queues which are a feature of the third rate,
 third world services provided by Dublin Airport.
Regulatory Developments
 "The European Court of First Instance's decision in December to dismiss the EU
 Commission's flawed 2004 Charleroi decision was a stunning victory for Ryanair,
 competition and regional airports across Europe. This ruling confirms that
 Ryanair did not receive unlawful State Aid or subsidies from Charleroi. This
 ruling renders the Commission's 2005 Airport Guidelines redundant. We again call
 on the European Commission to abandon the 8 other State Aid cases against
 regional airports in Europe and focus instead upon the real abuse of State Aid
 including the latest Government bail-out of Alitalia, and the State Aid recently
 given by the Austrian Government to its flag carrier to induce Lufthansa to buy
 them. We warmly welcome the EU's ruling last week that the over EUR1bn of
 discounted domestic airport charges, received by Air France at French airports
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Third Quarter Results
 was unlawful State Aid. There will now be a level playing field between
 international charges and domestic charges at French airports. The EU Commission
 should be commended for finally exposing this blatant abuse of the State Aid
 rules by Air France.
Aer Lingus Offer
 "On 22nd January last, the Irish Government announced that it would not accept
 Ryanair's cash offer of EUR1.40 per share for its 25% stake in Aer Lingus. We are
 disappointed by this rejection of a generous offer which valued Aer Lingus at
 EUR748m, but respected it and immediately withdrew the offer. This sadly condemns
 Aer Lingus to a bleak future as a loss making, subscale, regional airline, which
 has a high cost base and declining traffic numbers, and which, we believe, will
 report substantial losses in 2008 and again in 2009.
"Whilst we regret that the Government's decision means that we can not now
 deliver on our promises to reduce Aer Lingus's short-haul fares, double its
 short-haul fleet and create 1,000 new jobs, this decision clears the way for
 Ryanair to continue to focus on our own growth and expansion, reducing our costs
 and returning to substantial profitability over the coming year. It is doubtful
 that Ryanair will waste any further management time or resources making another
 offer for Aer Lingus, as its scale and losses will continue to render it
 increasingly irrelevant in Europe's airline landscape.
Balance Sheet
 "Our balance sheet continues to be one of the strongest in the industry with
 over EUR1.8bn in cash at the end of Q3. The rebound in profitability in fiscal
 2009/10 should lead to a further growth in our cash balances. Our large floating
 cash deposits provide a no-cost hedge to our floating debt and we plan to take
 advantage of the historically low interest rates to lock in much of our 2009
 aircraft deliveries at these low fixed interest rates. Our long term dollar
 hedging strategy will mean that in 2009/10 we will benefit by paying for
 aircraft at EUR/$ exchange rate of 1.50, significantly better than current market
 rates. We also recently exercised options over 13 Boeing aircraft for delivery
 in 2011, which will enable us to add cheaper and more fuel efficient aircraft to
 our business.
Q.4 and full year outlook
 "Our outlook for the fourth quarter has improved somewhat. Our decision not to

 hedge Q.4 oil prices has been vindicated by their continuing decline and we will
 benefit from much lower oil costs in Q.4 of approx. $500 per tonne. Some of this
 cost advantage will be diluted by weaker yields, which are the result of our
 aggressive price promotions, the decline in Sterling and the impact of the
 recession which is making consumers much more price sensitive. As a result of
 this degrading environment we expect Q.4 average fares to fall by 20% at the
 upper end of our previously guided range. Thanks to lower oil costs and
 continuing reductions in non oil operating costs, we expect the Q.4 loss will be
 smaller than previously anticipated, so we are upgrading our full year 2008/09
 guidance from break even to a net profit after tax in a range of EUR50m to EUR80m
 (Pre-exceptionals).
"Looking forward into fiscal 2009/10, Ryanair will enjoy significantly lower oil
 costs thanks to our recent hedging programme, when most of our competitors are
 already hedged at much higher prices. We intend to use this cost advantage to
 again lower fares. These lower prices will drive Ryanair's traffic growth,
 maintain high load factors (and ancillary sales) and capture market share from
 higher cost fuel surcharging competitors. We won't be in a position to give
 earnings guidance for next year, until the fare environment becomes somewhat
 clearer. At this time we expect fares to fall next year by over 10%, although if
 the recession deepens, it could be worse than this. However the 38% reduction in
 oil prices which our fuel hedging has secured will ensure that Ryanair returns
 to substantial profitability next year, when many of our competitors will be

 reporting losses.
"The longer and deeper this recession, the better it will be for the lowest cost
 producers in every sector. Like Lidl, Aldi, Ikea and McDonalds, Ryanair, is the
 lowest cost provider - by a distance - in the European airline industry, and we
 are poised for substantial traffic and profit growth in the coming year as the
 recession forces millions of passengers to focus on price, while still (in the
 case of Ryanair) enjoying our superior punctuality, fewer cancellations and
 younger aircraft fleet".
ENDS.    Monday, 2 February 2009
Note 1 - Quarter end December 2008, excludes exceptional costs of EUR17.3m on 15
 aircraft to be disposed of in 2008/09 and 2009/10.

 *Calculated on profit/(loss) for the year before exceptional items
Diluted earnings per share takes account solely of the potential future
 exercises of share options granted under the Company's share option schemes and
 the weighted average number of shares includes weighted average share options
 assumed to be converted of 1.6m (2007: 20.4m).
13.  Property, plant and equipment
 Acquisitions and disposals
 During the nine months ended December 31, 2008, the Group acquired assets with a
 cost of EUR401.8 million (period ended December 31, 2007: EUR578.4 million).There
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Third Quarter -12-
 were eight Boeing 737-800 aircraft disposed of during the period, the balance of
 the sales proceeds of which amounted to EUR169.6m.  Deposits have also been
 received in relation to future aircraft disposals.
14.  Post balance sheet events
 In January 2009, the Group exercised thirteen options under the 2005 contract
 with Boeing increasing its firm aircraft deliveries by this amount during the
 2011 fiscal year.
On December 1, 2008 the Group launched an offer to purchase Aer Lingus at a
 price of EUR1.40 per share. Ryanair currently owns 29.8% of Aer Lingus. On January
 22, 2009 the Irish Government decided not to accept Ryanair's all cash offer of
 EUR1.40 per share which valued Aer Lingus at EUR748m. The Government's decision
 means that the offer could not be successful since the 90% acceptance condition
 cannot be satisfied.  Accordingly on January 28, 2009 the offer was withdrawn.
15.  US GAAP Reconciliation
 Following on from the issuance by the SEC of Rule 3235 "Acceptance from Foreign
 Private Issuers of Financial Statements prepared in accordance with
 International Financial Reporting Standards without reconciliation to US GAAP",
 the Group has chosen to exclude a US GAAP Reconciliation from these interim
 financial statements.
16.Related party transactions
 We have related party relationships with our subsidiaries, directors and senior
 key management personnel. All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on
 consolidation and are not disclosed.
 There were no related party transactions that have taken place in the nine month
 period ended December 31, 2008 that materially affected the financial position
 or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no changes
 in the related party transactions described in the 2008 Annual Report that could
 have a material effect on the financial position or performance of the Company
 in the same period.

Reconciliation of results for the period under IFRS to adjusted results for the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Third Quarter -5-
 nine month period and quarter ended December 31, 2008
The unaudited condensed consolidated interim income statements for the nine
 month period and quarter ended December 31, 2008, as set forth on pages 6 and 7
 of this financial report, presents the results for the periods separately
 between pre-exceptional and exceptional items. Certain items are presented
 separately, as exceptional items, which, by virtue of their size or incidence,
 are unusual in the context of the Group's ongoing core operations, as we believe
 this presentation represents the underlying business more accurately and
 reflects the manner in which investors typically analyse the results.

Analysis of operating revenues and segmental analysis
 All revenues derive from the Group's principal activity and business segment as
 a low fares airline and includes scheduled services, car hire, internet income
 and related sales to third parties.
Revenue is analysed by geographical area (by country of origin) as follows:

All of the Group's operating profit arises from low fares airline-related
 activities, its only business segment. The major revenue earning assets of the
 Group are comprised of its aircraft fleet, which is registered in Ireland and
 therefore principally all profits accrue in Ireland. Since the Group's aircraft
 fleet is flexibly employed across its route network in Europe, there is no
 suitable basis of allocating such assets and related liabilities to geographical

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Third Quarter -7-
 Operating and Financial Overview
Introduction
For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") all figures
 and comments are by reference to the adjusted income statement excluding the
 exceptional items referred to below.  A reconciliation of the results for the
 period under IFRS to the adjusted results is provided on page 8.
Exceptional items in the nine month period December 31, 2008 amounted to
 EUR136.5m consisting of a EUR93.6m impairment of the Aer Lingus shareholding and an
 accelerated depreciation charge of EUR42.9m on aircraft to be disposed in the
 financial years 2008/9 and 2009/10.
Adjusted profit excluding exceptional items decreased by 74% to EUR113.1m in the
 nine months ended December 31, 2008. Including exceptional items the loss for
 the period amounted to EUR23.4m compared to a profit of EUR454.8m in the nine month
 period ended December 31, 2007.
 Summary nine month period ended December 31, 2008
Profit after tax decreased by 74% to EUR113.1m compared to EUR442.6m in the nine
 month period ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to a 91% increase in fuel
 costs.  Total operating revenues increased by 14% to EUR2,415.1m, slower than the
 17% growth in passenger volumes, as average fares declined by 5%, due to the
 absence of Easter in the period, lower baggage penetration rates, the combined
 impact of the movement in sterling/euro exchange rates and the aggressive fare
 promotions.  Ancillary revenues grew by 25% to EUR454.0m during the period.  Total
 revenue per passenger as a result decreased by 3%, whilst the Load
 Factor remained flat during the period at 84%.
Total operating expenses increased by 40% to EUR2,270.6m, primarily due to the
 increase in fuel prices, the higher level of activity, and increased costs,
 associated with the growth of the airline.  Fuel, which represents 49% of total
 operating costs compared to 36% in the previous period, increased by 91% to
 EUR1,116.5m due to the increase in the price per gallon and an increase in the
 number of hours flown, offset by a positive movement in the US dollar exchange
 rate versus the euro.  Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 5% and including fuel
 they rose by 20%.  Operating margins fell by 18 points to 6% whilst operating
 profit decreased by 71% to EUR144.5m.
Net margins fell from 21% at December 31, 2007 to 5% for the reasons outlined
 above.
Earnings per share for the period was 7.65 cent compared to 29.14 cent in the
 previous period ended December 31, 2007.
Gross cash decreased by EUR355.0m primarily due to the reduction in profitability
 arising from the increase in fuel costs. The Group generated cash from operating
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Third Quarter -7-
 activities of EUR46.6m and a further EUR169.6m of delivery proceeds arising from the
 sale of eight Boeing 737-800 aircraft which part funded a EUR46.0m share buy back
 programme and capital expenditure incurred during the period.  Capital
 expenditure of EUR401.8m largely consisted of advance aircraft payments for future
 aircraft deliveries and the delivery of twelve new Boeing 737-800 aircraft.
 Long term debt, net of repayments, decreased by EUR119.7m during the period.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis nine month period ended December 31, 2008
Adjusted profit after tax, decreased by 74% to EUR113.1m primarily due to higher
 fuel costs.  Total operating revenues grew by 14% due to a 17% increase in
 passenger numbers and the strong growth in ancillary revenues compared to the
 period ended December 31, 2007. This was partially offset by a decrease in fares
 due to the absence of Easter, lower baggage penetration rates, the adverse
 impact of the movement in sterling and aggressive fare promotions.  The growth
 in revenues was offset primarily by increases in fuel prices, which rose by 91%
 to EUR1,116.5m.  Operating margins, as a result, fell by 18 points to 6%,
 whilst operating profit decreased by 71% to EUR144.5m.
Total operating revenues increased by 14% to EUR2,415.1m, slower than the 17%
 increase in passenger volumes to 45.7m.  Total revenue per passenger decreased
 by 3% due to the 5% fall in average fares.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 11% to EUR1,961.2m reflecting a 17% rise
 in traffic due to increased passenger numbers on existing routes and the
 successful launch of new routes and bases. This is offset by a 5% decrease in
 average fares due to the absence of Easter, lower baggage penetration rates and
 the adverse impact of the movement in sterling to the euro.Load factor remained
 flat at 84%, compared to the period ended December 31, 2007.
Ancillary revenues continue to outpace the growth of passenger volumes and rose
 by 25% to EUR454.0m.  This performance reflects the growth of onboard sales,
 non-flight scheduled revenues, and other ancillary products.
Total operating expenses rose by 40% to EUR2,270.6 primarily due to the 91%
 increase in fuel prices, the higher level of activity, and the increased costs
 associated with the growth of the airline.
Staff costs increased by 10% to EUR234.9m.  Excluding the one off charge of EUR7.0m,
 for a staff share option grant, in the prior year period ended December 31,
 2007, staff costs increased by 14%.  This primarily reflects a 26% increase in
 average employee numbers to 6,347. Cabin crew, who earn lower than the average
 salary, accounted for the vast majority of the increase.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 19% to EUR147.5m. This reflects, net of
 disposals, an additional 12 aircraft or a 19% increase in the weighted average
 number of lower cost 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this period compared to the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Third Quarter -7-
 period ended December 31, 2007.
Fuel costs rose by 91% to EUR1,116.5m due to the higher cost of fuel in the period
 and an 18% increase in the number of hours flown.
Maintenance costs increased by 20% to EUR49.6m due to a 17% increase in the number
 of leased aircraft from 35 to 41 and increased costs arising from the growth of
 line maintenance activity at new bases.  These increases were partially offset
 by a stronger euro versus US dollar exchange rate during the period.
Marketing and distribution costs decreased by 41% to EUR9.3m due to tight control
 on expenditure and the increased focus on internet based promotions.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 4% to EUR57.5m, which is lower than the 17%
 increase in the number of leased aircraft from 35 to 41 compared to the period
 ended December 31, 2007 reflecting the positive impact of lower lease rental
 rates obtained and the impact of a stronger euro versus US dollar exchange rate.
Route charges rose by 13% to EUR218.0m due to an increase in the number of sectors
 flown offset by the positive impact of a stronger euro versus sterling.
Airport and handling charges increased by 14% to EUR344.5m due to the 17% increase
 in passenger volumes, offset by lower costs at new airports and bases launched
 and savings achieved on handling costs.

 Other expenses increased by 4% to EUR92.8m, which is lower than the growth in
 ancillary revenues, due to improved margins on some existing products and cost
 reductions on some indirect costs.
Operating margins have declined by 18 points to 6% due to the reasons outlined
 above and operating profits have decreased by 71% to EUR144.5m compared to
 the period ended December 31, 2007.
Finance income increased by 2% to EUR64.0m primarily due to higher returns
 achieved in the early part of the year offset by lower interest rates in the
 third quarter.
Finance expense increased by 32% to EUR92.7m primarily due to the drawdown of debt
 to part finance the purchase of new aircraft and the restructuring costs
 incurred in relation to aircraft disposals.
Foreign exchange losses during the period of EUR1.5m are primarily due to the
 impact of changes in the US dollar exchange rate against the euro.
Exceptional items:
Accelerated depreciation of EUR42.9m arose on aircraft to be disposed in the
 financial years 2008/9 and 2009/10, to write these aircraft down to their
 recoverable amounts when disposal occurs, thus leading to no gain or loss on
 disposal.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Third Quarter -8-
Impairment charge:  During the period the Group recognised an impairment charge
 of EUR93.6m on its Aer Lingus shareholding reflecting the decline in the Aer
 Lingus share price from EUR2.00 per share at March 31, 2008 to EUR1.40 per share at
 June 30, 2008.  The share price was EUR1.50 at December 31, 2008.  Under IFRS
 accounting rules, this positive mark to market movement, in the period to
 December 31, 2008, can only be recorded in the balance sheet through reserves.
 These shares are currently trading at approx. EUR1.00 per share and if they remain
 at this price at the end of the fourth quarter an additional impairment charge
 of EUR63.3m will arise.
Balance sheet
 Gross cash decreased by EUR355.0m primarily due to the reduction in profitability
 arising from the increase in fuel costs.  The Group generated cash from
 operating activities of EUR46.6m and a further EUR169.6m delivery proceeds on the
 sale of eight Boeing 737-800 aircraft which part funded a EUR46.0m share buy back
 programme and capital expenditure incurred during the period.  Capital
 expenditure of EUR401.8m largely consisted of advance aircraft payments for future
 aircraft deliveries and the delivery of twelve new Boeing 737-800 aircraft.
 Long term debt, net of repayments, decreased by EUR119.7m during the period.
 Shareholders' Equity at December 31, 2008 increased by EUR104.8m to EUR2,607.0m,
 compared to March 31, 2008 due to the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for
 derivative financial assets, pensions and stock option grants, offset by
 the EUR46.0m share buy back and the post exceptional loss of EUR23.4m in the period.
 (See details in note 10).
Quarter ended December 31, 2008
Introduction
Exceptional items in the quarter ended December 31, 2008 amounted to EUR17.3m
 consisting of an accelerated depreciation charge on aircraft to be disposed in
 the financial years 2008/9 and 2009/10.
The adjusted loss excluding exceptional items was EUR101.5m in the quarter ended
 December 31, 2008. Including exceptional items the loss for the quarter amounted
 to EUR118.8m compared to a profit of EUR47.2m in the quarter ended December 31,
 2007.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Quarter ended December 31, 2008
The company suffered an adjusted loss after tax of EUR101.5m in the quarter,
 compared to an adjusted profit after tax of EUR35.0m in the comparative quarter
 ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to a 71% increase in fuel costs and a 9%
 decrease in average fares.  Operating revenues grew at 6%, slower than the 13%
 increase in passenger numbers, due to a 9% decrease in average fares arising
 from lower baggage penetration rates, the adverse impact of the movement in
 sterling to the euro and aggressive fare promotions, partially offset by a rise
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Third Quarter -8-
 in ancillary revenues. The growth in revenues was more than offset by a 71%
 increase in fuel costs to EUR328.0m. As a result of the above, operating margins
 were negative (15%) and the Group reported an operating loss of EUR91.9m.
Total operating revenues increased by 6% to EUR604.5m whilst passenger volumes
 increased by 13% to 14.0m.  Total revenue per passenger decreased by 6% as
 average fares fell by 9%.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 3% to EUR472.7m, slower than the 13%
 increase in traffic, as average fares fell by 9% due to the impact of fare
 promotions, lower baggage penetration rates and the adverse impact of the
 movement in sterling and aggressive fare promotions.Load factor remained flat at
 81% for the quarter ended December 31, 2008.
Ancillary revenues continue to outpace the growth of passenger volumes and rose
 by 19% to EUR131.8m in the quarter. This performance reflects the growth of on
 board sales, non-flight scheduled revenues, and other ancillary products.
Total operating expenses rose by 33% to EUR696.4m primarily due to the 71%
 increase in fuel prices, the higher level of activity, and the increased costs
 associated with the growth of the airline. Total operating expenses were also
 positively impacted by a 3% decrease in average sector length.
Staff costs have increased by 12% to EUR74.9m.  This primarily reflects a 16%
 increase in average employee numbers to 6,298. Cabin crew, who earn lower than
 the average salary, accounted for the vast majority of the increase.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 7% to EUR50.7m. This reflects, net of
 disposals, an additional 12 aircraft compared to the quarter ended December 31,
 2007.  Due to the Boeing strike, most of the additional aircraft were delivered
 towards the end of the quarter.
Fuel costs rose by 71% to EUR328.0m due to the increase in fuel costs and a 10%
 increase in the number of hours flown.
Maintenance costs increased by 33% to EUR18.9m primarily due to a combination of a
 17% increase in the number of leased aircraft from 35 to 41 and increased costs
 arising from the growth of line maintenance activity at new bases.  These
 increases were partially offset by a stronger euro versus US dollar exchange
 rate during the period.
Marketing and distribution costs increased by EUR0.9m to EUR2.0m due to an increased
 level of activity in the period offset by tight control on expenditure and the
 increased focus on internet based promotions.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 5% to EUR19.3m as the number of leased aircraft
 increased by 17% to 41 compared to the quarter ended December 31,
 2007 reflecting the positive impact of lower lease rental rates obtained, the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Third Quarter -8-
 impact of a stronger euro versus US dollar exchange rate and the delivery of the
 new aircraft towards at the end of the quarter.
Route charges rose by 6% to EUR67.0m due to an increase in the number of sectors
 flown and a 3% decrease in the average sector length and the positive impact of
 a stronger euro versus sterling.
Airport and handling charges increased by 13% to EUR106.2m whilst passenger
 volumes increased by 13%.
Other expenses increased by 6% to EUR29.4m, which is lower than the growth in
 ancillary revenues, due to improved margins on some existing products and cost
 reductions on some indirect costs.
Operating margins have declined by 23 points to a negative margin of 15% due to
 the reasons outlined above and operating losses of EUR91.9m arose in the quarter,
 down from operating profits of EUR44.2m for the period ended December 31, 2007.
Finance income has decreased by 18% to EUR17.6m in the quarter due to lower
 average cash balances and interest rate cuts in the quarter.
Finance expense increased by 35% to EUR34.2m primarily due to the drawdown of debt
 to part finance the purchase of 21 new aircraft and the restructuring costs
 incurred in relation to aircraft disposals.
Foreign exchange losses during the quarter of EUR1.6m are primarily due to the
 impact of changes in the US dollar exchange rate against the euro.
Exceptional items:
Accelerated depreciation of EUR17.3m arose on aircraft to be disposed in the
 financial years 2008/9 and 2009/10, to write these aircraft down to their

 RYANAIR CALLS FOR 30% CUT IN DUBLIN AIRPORT'S
 HIGH FEES (AND THE SCRAPPING OF THE EUR10 TRAVEL TAX) TO REVERSE
 TRAFFIC DECLINES
Ryanair today (Friday, 30th January 2009) called on the Government
 owned DAA monopoly to cut airport charges by 30% - thereby reversing
 the price increases imposed on airlines and passengers over the past
 3 years.  These unjustified price increases from carparks to check-in
 desks, to the treble charging for kiosks have created a wave of route
 closures and airline departures from high cost Dublin Airport, as
 competitor airports across the UK and Europe lower their charges,
 leaving Dublin Airport uncompetitive and out of touch.
Dublin Airport's traffic declined by 9% in December and is now in
 freefall.  The DAA's attempt to blame this on fuel surcharges is
 absurd, when very few passengers at Dublin pay fuel surcharges.  This
 traffic collapse will accelerate next April when the Government's new
 EUR10 travel tax is introduced.  At a time when the Irish Government is
 looking for ways to stimulate economic activity and job creation, the
 DAA's policy of imposing inflation busting price increases, building
 inefficient and over-specified facilities and delivering perhaps the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Calls for 30% Cut in Dublin Airport's High Fees (and the Scrapping of the 
EUR10 Travel T
 worst airport service in Europe, continues to damage Irish traffic
 and Ireland's reputation abroad.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
"Ryanair and other airlines at Dublin have long complained about the
 high cost, out of touch, "couldn't care less" attitude of the
 Government owned DAA monopoly.  The traffic collapse at Dublin
 Airport in recent months shows the damage the DAA monopoly is doing
 to Irish tourism and the Irish economy.  At a time when Ryanair is
 growing traffic by 14%, at lower cost airports all over Europe, the
 9% fall in Dublin's traffic in December can only be explained by the
 high costs and third rate facilities passengers are subjected to by
 the DAA monopoly.
"The DAA which has increased charges by 30% over the past three years
 - more than twice the rate of inflation - should now reverse these
 charges by reducing carparking, airport check-in fees and passenger
 fees by 30%, and eliminating the double and treble charging for
 things like kiosks in terminals which are already fully paid for by
 the airlines through high passenger charges.  The Government can also
 play its part by scrapping the insane EUR10 travel tax which is to be
 levied on passengers next April.
"As the string of route closures and airline withdrawals from Dublin
 over the past 12 months demonstrates, the DAA monopoly is doing real
 damage to Irish tourism and the Irish economy.  This traffic collapse
 will get worse next April when the Government's crazy EUR10 passenger
 tax is introduced.  At a time when the Government is asking all
 sectors of Irish society to share the pain, it is not unreasonable to
 ask the Government's own airport monopoly to lead the way by
 reversing the cost increases imposed on airlines and passengers over
 the past 3 years.  This 30% cut in charges if implemented will simply
 return the DAA to the charging levels which prevailed back in 2007.
 It would reverse the traffic declines which the DAA has been
 responsible for at Dublin Airport last year, although even with a 30%
 cut in costs, Dublin Airport would still be much more expensive than
 most other UK and European airports who are now  reducing costs to
 stimulate traffic and tourism growth".

 RYANAIR WELCOMES EU RULING ON OVER EUR1 BILLION IN UNLAWFUL STATE AID
 TO AIR FRANCE
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Thursday, 29th
 January 2009) welcomed yesterday's decision by the European
 Commission to disallow unlawful State aid to Air France in the form
 of reduced airport charges on domestic routes in France.  The
 Commission's investigation resulted from Ryanair's State aid
 complaint in May 2006 against the over EUR1 billion in State aid
 received by Air France in the form of these unlawful domestic route
 discounts.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Jim Callaghan said:
"Yesterday's decision confirms yet again that flag carriers
 throughout Europe have been, and are, in receipt of billions of euros
 in State aid, while the Commission has been wasting time pursuing
 tiny regional and secondary airports, like Charleroi, for, what the
 Courts have now found, were commercial arms-length deals with
 Ryanair, easyJet and other low fares airlines.
"Following the recent dismissal by the European Court of First
 Instance of the Commission's flawed 2004 Charleroi decision,
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Welcomes EU Ruling On State Aid To Air France
 yesterday's decision is a second significant victory for European
 consumers and low fares airlines in less than two months.  The
 Commission should now recognise the benefits of low fares air travel
 to regional and secondary airports, and start promoting low-cost
 regional airport development similar to Charleroi, Tampere, Lübeck,
 Schönefeld, Alghero, Pau, Aarhus, Bratislava and Hahn.
"Ryanair regrets that the Commission did not order Air France to
 repay the EUR1 billion in unlawful State aid, which it received between
 1997 and 2008 in the form of reduced domestic airport charges within
 France.  Nevertheless, yesterday's decision is a welcome change in
 the Commission's record of ignoring State aid to Europe's flag
 carrier airlines".

 RYANAIR CONGRATULATES AER LINGUS ON FINDING A PARTNER WHICH IS EVEN
 WEAKER AND IN WORSE SHAPE THAN AER LINGUS
Ryanair, today (Thursday, 22nd Jan '09), congratulated Aer Lingus on
 the announcement of its "partnership" with United Airlines to operate
 a route between Washington and Madrid - in 15 months time - from
 March 2010 onwards.
This partnership, which joins Aer Lingus to one of the weakest U.S.
 airlines doesn't add one job, one passenger, or one visitor to
 Ireland whatsoever.  United Airlines in 2005 defaulted on pension
 obligations for 122,000 employees, when its $9.8 Billion pension
 default was one of the largest in U.S. history.  Ryanair believes
 that United Airlines is in many ways similar to Aer Lingus.  Both
 have recently announced losses (in United's case a $5.35 Billion -
 yes Billion - loss) for 2008, and both airlines have recently
 announced capacity cuts, route cuts, pay cuts and job cuts.
Responding to this "partnership" today, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary
 said:
"Aer Lingus and United Airways share many similar traits.  They both
 used to be big in the 1950's and 1960's, but sadly today they are
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Congratulates Aer Lingus on Finding a Partner Which is Even Weaker and in 
Worse Shape Th
 just shadows of their former glory.  Both have recently announced
 losses, job cuts and pay cuts.  After months of trawling around
 looking for partners, it is a sad reflection on Aer Lingus that the
 best they could come up with is one of the weakest and biggest loss
 makers in the U.S. airline industry.  Given the scale of United's
 losses there is no guarantee that they will even be around in March
 2010 to operate this "partnership".
"It is hard to think of any transatlantic airline losing any sleep at
 the thought of being faced with the combined weakness of Aer Lingus
 and United Airlines on the Madrid-Washington route.  Today's
 announcement shows just how desperate Aer Lingus is to find a
 partner, any partner it can, even if the flights don't start until
 March 2010.  This so called "partnership" with another "loser" like
 United shows that Aer Lingus has no independent strategy, and no
 prospect of remaining independent.
"Today's "partnership" comes on the back of a series of recent
 flip-flops by Aer Lingus on fuel surcharging, the Heathrow-Shannon
 route and Dermot Mannion's EUR2.8m failure fee and sadly shows that Aer
 Lingus has no credible strategy either for independence or for
 growing traffic, tourism and jobs in Ireland.  Aer Lingus can't match
 Ryanair's prices, it can't match Ryanair's punctuality, and it can't
 match Ryanair's strong growth and vision for the future either".

 UPDATE ON RYANAIR'S OFFER FOR AER LINGUS
Ryanair, today (Thursday, 22 January 2009) at a media briefing in
 Dublin, confirmed that time was running out for acceptances of its
 offer for Aer Lingus.  Ryanair confirmed that there is just one week
 remaining (to Fri 30 Jan) for Ryanair to make any decision to amend
 any of the terms of its offer (to address possible Aer Lingus
 shareholder concerns) and just 3 weeks left (to Fri 13 Feb) for Aer
 Lingus shareholders to accept Ryanair's offer.
Ryanair confirmed that it remains open to meeting with Aer Lingus
 shareholders to discuss any areas of concern that they may have in
 relation to Ryanair's offer to merge with Aer Lingus, and Ryanair's
 proposals to rapidly grow and expand Aer Lingus, while at the same
 time lowering its shorthaul fares and improving its service (such as
 punctuality) to Ryanair levels.
Ryanair confirmed its view that the trend of EU airline consolidation
 continues to accelerate, as evidenced by the EU's 12 Jan approval of
 the Vueling/Clickair merger in Spain, and the EU's 19 Jan approval of
 the Austrian Government's investment in Austrian to enable its sale
 to Lufthansa to proceed.  The new (21 Jan) announcement by Finnair
 that it is now "open to evaluating a combination with SAS", is
 noteworthy, because Finnair was one of the independent airline models
 previously quoted by Aer Lingus as an example of its "independence"
 strategy.   Ryanair said it was interesting that while all this
 merger and consolidation activity is taking place, no airline other
Ryanair Holdings PLC Update on Ryanair 's Offer for Aer Lingus
 than Ryanair has publicly expressed any interest in Aer Lingus.
Ryanair also referred to details of the European Airline Share Index
 since 26 Nov 2008 (just prior to its offer).  Over this period the
 average share price of quoted European airlines has fallen by some
 6%.  By contrast Aer Lingus' share price has risen 34%, thanks
 largely Ryanair believes to its takeover offer.  Ryanair believes
 that if its offer is unsuccessful on 13 February next, then Aer
 Lingus' share price will fall substantially as the markets begin to
 focus upon Aer Lingus' adverse fuel hedging position in 2009, and
 what Ryanair believes will be Aer Lingus' substantial post
 exceptional after tax losses in 2008 and 2009, and the impact of the
 deepening Irish recession upon Aer Lingus' traffic and yields over
 the coming year or two.
Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
"Ryanair's all cash offer of EUR1.40 per share values Aer Lingus at
 EUR748m.  At yesterday's closing prices, Ryanair is offering to pay
 almost as much in cash for Aer Lingus as the combined market value of
 Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks plc.  This is an extremely
 generous all cash offer at a time of collapsing equity values in
 Ireland and across Europe.
"Aer Lingus shareholders and in particular the Government and the
 ESOT must decide before 13 February whether they wish to accept the
 substantial cash proceeds which will accrue from Ryanair's offer and
 the 1,000 jobs which has Ryanair has committed to creating in Aer
 Lingus over the next 5 years, if our offer is successful.  The
 Government, the ESOT and all other Aer Lingus shareholders must now
 decide whether they want to accept this cash offer and see these
 1,000 new jobs created or not".

 RYANAIR RESPONDS TO IRISH GOVERNMENT STATEMENT ON AER LINGUS TAKEOVER
 OFFER
Ryanair said this evening (22 Jan) that it was disappointed by the
 Irish Government's decision not to accept its all cash offer of EUR1.40
 per share, which values Aer Lingus at EUR748m.  However Ryanair will
 respect and abide by the Government's decision, which  means that
 Ryanair's offer will not be successful, since our 90% acceptance
 condition cannot be satisfied.
Ryanair believes the Government's decision is a wrong one, as this
 cash offer greatly exceeds the intrinsic value of Aer Lingus
 (something which Ryanair believes will be reflected in a sharp fall
 in Aer Lingus' share price over the coming days).  The Government's
 decision also means that Ryanair's plan to double the size of Aer
 Lingus' short-haul fleet and create 1,000 new Aer Lingus jobs cannot
 now proceed.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"We will respect and abide by the Government's decision.  We don't
 think it is in the best interests of Aer Lingus, which will be
 isolated as a small, peripheral, loss making airline, reduced to
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Responds to Irish Government Statement on Aer Lingus Takeover Offer
 announcing so called "partnerships" with other loss makers like
 United Airlines.
"It is strange, when the Irish Government is looking for EUR2bn in cost
 savings, that it would reject an offer of EUR188m for its 25% stake in
 Aer Lingus.  It is also sad,  when thousands of jobs are being lost
 in Ireland, that Ryanair's offer to create 1,000 new Irish jobs in
 Aer Lingus over the next 5 years has been rejected.
"We would like to thank the Government and other Aer Lingus
 shareholders for the time and consideration they have given to our
 offer over the past 7 weeks.  Ryanair will now focus all of our
 energies on continuing to successfully grow and develop Ireland's
 biggest airline and we will ensure that Ireland will still be home to
 one of Europe's big four airline groups (Ryanair, Air France, BA and
 Lufthansa)."

RYANAIR UPDATE ON OFFER FOR AER LINGUS
Since the commencement of the Offer, Ryanair has met with representatives of the
 Aer Lingus Board, the ESOT, Tailwind Nominees and other shareholders and
 stakeholders to outline the benefits of Ryanair's proposed merger with Aer
 Lingus. Ryanair hopes to meet shortly with the Minister for Transport and/ or
 his advisers to highlight the substantial cash proceeds for shareholders (almost
 EUR750 million for 100%) and 1,000 new jobs which Ryanair has committed to deliver
 in Aer Lingus should its Offer be successful.
Ryanair filed the Form CO notification for the proposed merger with the EU
 Competition Commission on 8 January 2009. The Commission is expected to
 determine within 25 working days ("Phase I') whether the proposed merger will be
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Update on Offer for Aer Lingus
 approved, or to initiate a more detailed "Phase II" process.
Any Phase II process will absorb substantial government, EU and company
 resources. Ryanair does not see any benefit for the parties in such a protracted
 and time-consuming process unless the proposed merger has significant prior
 support from Aer Lingus shareholders. Accordingly, Ryanair announces that it
 does not intend to engage in a lengthy Phase II review process with the EU
 unless it receives such support from Aer Lingus shareholders, including the
 acceptance of the Offer by either the Irish Government or the ESOT
As previously announced, the Offer will remain open for acceptance until 1.00
 p.m. (Dublin time) on 13 February, 2009. Accordingly, the last effective date
 for any change to the terms of Ryanair's Offer will be 30 January, 2009.
Ryanair CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
"The benefits of this merger are compelling for all Aer Lingus shareholders. At
 a time of crisis and consolidation in the European airline industry and, what we
 believe will be post-exceptional, after-tax losses in Aer Lingus, we are
 offering almost EUR750m in cash (for 100%), and we have committed to create 1,000
 jobs in Aer Lingus as well as securing the future of Aer Lingus when, in our
 view, it has been bypassed and isolated by the rapidly accelerating process of
 European airline consolidation.
"We believe that 2009 will be a bleak time for Aer Lingus and its shareholders
 with substantial post-exceptional, after-tax losses as well as a significant
 hole in its pension schemes. However, we don't intend to waste our time or that
 of the Irish Government or EU Commission over the next six months if Aer Lingus
 shareholders do not want the only merger offer currently available to them to
 secure Aer Lingus' future".
The Offer remains subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Offer
 Document.

"Significant prior support" means a level of acceptances from Aer Lingus
 shareholders that is significant in the context of the acceptance condition. The
 Offer is subject to the condition of valid acceptances being received (and not
 withdrawn) in respect of not less than 90 per cent. in nominal value of Aer
 Lingus Shares, or such lower percentage as Ryanair may determine, subject always
 to the Takeover Rules, provided that this condition shall not be satisfied
 unless Ryanair shall have acquired or agreed to acquire (whether pursuant to the
 Offer or otherwise) Aer Lingus Shares carrying in aggregate more than 50 per
 cent. of the voting rights then exercisable at a general meeting of Aer Lingus.
 Ryanair has not made any decision in relation to the acceptance condition. As at
 3.00 p.m. on 5 January 2009 valid acceptances had been received in respect of
 approximately 29.83 per cent. of the issued share capital of Aer Lingus,
 including acceptances received from Ryanair Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary
 of Ryanair, representing 29.82 per cent. of the issued share capital of Aer
 Lingus.

RYANAIR UPDATE ON OFFER FOR AER LINGUS
In response to questions at a Ryanair seat sale press conference in Dublin this
 morning, Michael O'Leary commented:
"While no decision has been made in relation to any change in the terms of our
 merger Offer, we have no intention of increasing our Offer to a price of EUR2 or
 above. We are not stupid people and will not pay stupid prices.
"Our Offer will deliver almost EUR750 million to Aer Lingus shareholders including
 almost EUR190 million for the Irish government as well as 1,000 new jobs in Aer
 Lingus at a time when thousands of jobs are being lost in Ireland.
"The market valued Aer Lingus shares at less than EUR1 before our Offer and I
 believe that if our Offer is not successful by 13 February, 2009, the Aer Lingus
Ryanair Holdings PLC Offer Update in Response to Media Questions
 share price will return to these pre Offer levels.
"Ryanair advisers are seeking an early meeting with the Minister for Transport's
 advisers, IBI to emphasise that a decision must be made on Ryanair's Offer
 within the next three weeks".
This statement of intention is a no increase statement under the Takeover
 Rules. In accordance with the Takeover Rules, following this statement Ryanair
 cannot increase its Offer to EUR2 or above per Aer Lingus Share save with Panel
 consent.

Aer Lingus Chairman Challenges Ryanair to Provide Remedy Proposals
Aer Lingus believes that Ryanair Offer is unlikely to be Capable of Completion
Aer Lingus notes Ryanair's announcement today that it will not proceed with a
 Phase II review of its Offer for Aer Lingus without significant support from Aer
 Lingus shareholders, including the acceptances of the Irish Government or the
 ESOT.
Aer Lingus continues to believe that the Offer is diversionary and fatally
 flawed. Ryanair has not disclosed any new remedies to Aer Lingus shareholders
 nor provided any new evidence that clearance could be achieved. Ryanair has
 failed to disclose to Aer Lingus shareholders the nature of any new remedies
Aer Lingus Group PLC Challenges Ryanair to provide remedy proposals
 that it believes will enable it to secure competition approval from the European
 Commission. We believe this failure is unacceptable in the context of a bid that
 seeks to overturn a recent prohibition.
The Chairman of Aer Lingus, Colm Barrington, is writing to the Chairman of
 Ryanair, David Bonderman, requesting that Ryanair provide to all Aer Lingus
 shareholders the full details of the remedies that Ryanair has discussed with
 the European Commission or those remedies it believes will enable it to secure
 Commission approval. Without transparency on this matter, Aer Lingus
 shareholders may conclude that the Offer is incapable of completion. Aer Lingus
 expects that Ryanair will respond positively to this invitation if Ryanair truly
 wishes to demonstrate its offer is capable of completion.
Aer Lingus has a Vibrant Future as an Independent Airline
Since its IPO in 2006, Aer Lingus has grown in a disciplined manner, continuing
 to develop its operations from Dublin, Cork and Shannon and developing new
 international bases in Belfast and Gatwick. Aer Lingus has significant
 opportunities to grow its profitable operations further, underpinned by lower
 fuel prices, a significant fleet order from Airbus and the development of T2 at
 Dublin Airport. Aer Lingus has launched 42 new routes since Ryanair's last
 diversionary Offer and maintained its position as the preferred Irish carrier,
 with 83% of surveyed Irish consumers preferring to fly Aer Lingus to Ryanair.
At the same time, Aer Lingus has achieved Unit Cost reductions in airport costs,
 fuel management, employee costs and productivity, maintenance and distribution.
 Unit Costs excluding fuel have fallen over 12% since 2005 (from EURcents 4.38 to
 EURcents 3.83) enabling Aer Lingus to report an expected Profit in 2008. Aer
 Lingus believes further Unit Cost reductions will be delivered with the
 implementation of its recent restructuring, the expansion of its fleet and the
 development of new international bases. This underpins an expected Profit in
 2009.  Aer Lingus' profit forecast has been independently reviewed by
 PricewaterhouseCoopers and their report is set out at Appendix VI of the
 circular to shareholders published on 22 December 2008, as required by the
 Takeover Rules.
Aer Lingus' shareholders should not be distracted by Ryanair's claim that
 European airline consolidation is inevitable. In the past five years the only
 consolidations of any comparable size that have taken place have involved
 failing airlines such as Alitalia, Austrian Airlines and Swiss. Aer Lingus
 clearly does not fall into this category. Aer Lingus has unmatched financial
 strength, with one of the highest Net Cash balances and the best liquidity of
 all major European airlines. Even Ryanair's own advisers believe that Aer Lingus
 is one of the best placed of all European airlines, having been quoted as saying
 that "the chances of Aer Lingus going bust are zero".
Aer Lingus Group PLC Challenges Ryanair to provide remedy proposals
The Ryanair Offer is not capable of completion without remedies
Aer Lingus believes that Ryanair has attempted to divert Aer Lingus
 shareholders' attention away from the central issues of the Offer. In
 particular, Aer Lingus believes that Ryanair has not faced up to the realities
 in relation to its ability to achieve approval from the European Commission for
 a merger of Aer Lingus and Ryanair.
In June 2007 the European Commission prohibited the merger of Aer Lingus and
 Ryanair, as the combination would have created a monopoly or dominant position
 on 35 routes. The Commission did not accept that Ryanair's remedy proposals
 would allow for competition to be achieved. Today, a combination of Aer Lingus
 and Ryanair would be even more dominant with the number of monopoly and
 overlapping routes increasing since June 2007. Moreover, according to a recent
 survey the Irish consumer remains unconvinced, with less than a quarter
 supporting a Ryanair acquisition of Aer Lingus.
Ryanair is still seeking to overturn the 2007 European Commission prohibition by
 an appeal. We note Ryanair's comments today in relation to not wanting to waste
 the time of the Irish Government or the European Commission in another Phase II
 investigation without significant shareholder support. Given this, and to avoid
 another significant waste of shareholder funds, Ryanair should withdraw their
 appeal of the 2007 prohibition.
Aer Lingus believe that the Ryanair Offer is unlikely to be capable of
 completion. Despite this, Ryanair has limited itself to repeating to Aer Lingus
 shareholders part of the remedies package which the European Commission rejected
 as insufficient last time. Ryanair has failed to disclose to Aer Lingus
 shareholders the complete remedies it will offer this time that will enable it
 to secure competition approval from the Commission. Aer Lingus believes that
 this is because Ryanair does not have remedy proposals that are capable of
 delivering this Offer.
Clarifications
On 30 December 2008, Aer Lingus spokesman Enda Corneille was quoted as saying
 "Paying out over 25k of his own shareholder's funds to reprint a letter that is
 out of date shows how desperate Michael O'Leary is to avoid facing up to the
 fundamental issue, which is that his bid drastically undervalues Aer Lingus and
 is not capable of completion". Aer Lingus continues to believe that Ryanair is
 wasting the funds of both Ryanair and Aer Lingus shareholders and that Ryanair
 is avoiding the fundamental issues of the Offer. Aer Lingus would like to
 clarify that the comment "not capable of completion" is an expression of opinion
 by Mr Corneille and should have been qualified by reference to the Ryanair Offer
 being unlikely to be capable of completion, as referred to above.
On 18 December 2008, Aer Lingus Chairman Colm Barrington made a statement to the
Aer Lingus Group PLC Challenges Ryanair to provide remedy proposals
 Oireachtas Transport Committee that "Aer Lingus has made over EUR200m profits
 since the IPO". Aer Lingus has reported a cumulative total of EUR209m of Profit
 since 2006 with Profit for 2006 being based on an underlying measure of
 profitability as detailed in the Aer Lingus Annual Report 2006, and 2007 Profit
 and H1 2008 Profit being based on Aer Lingus Annual Report 2007 and Aer Lingus
 Interim Report 2008.

 AER LINGUS' LATEST FLIP-FLOP
 UNLAWFUL AGREEMENT REMOVES ANY CREDIBILITY
 FROM MESSRS. BARRINGTON AND MANNION
 Ryanair this evening (Friday, 9th January 2009) welcomed the latest
 flip-flop decision from Aer Lingus.   So far in recent weeks we have
 seen Aer Lingus reinstate the Shannon-Heathrow route, withdraw its
 fuel surcharges, open a base in Gatwick and today, withdraw the
 indefensible and illegal 'Failure Fee' awarded to its Chief Executive
 Dermot Mannion.
 Speaking this evening, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary
 said:
"Neither the Chairman nor the Chief Executive of Aer Lingus have any
 credibility after this series of flip-flop decisions, made only in
 response to Ryanair's merger proposal with Aer Lingus.  How can
 shareholders believe anything that they say?  Why did the Chairman of
 Aer Lingus defend the Chief Executives 'Failure Fee' just five days
 ago and state that "such a contract is perfectly normal" and a week
 later rescind it.  Aer Lingus claimed that this was a 'constructive
 dismissal' payment.  It is now evident to everyone that it was
 nothing of the sort.  This payment, which did not have the support of
 the Board, let alone the shareholders, was nothing less than an
 attempt to defraud the Company and its shareholders.  This Board and
 Management has no credibility left with its shareholders".
Ends.

Aer Lingus Announcement
Dublin, London, 9 January: Dermot Mannion, Chief Executive and Sean Coyle, Chief Financial Officer have 
requested that a condition in their contracts of employment which would provide for compensation in the event of 
constructive dismissal if the airline was acquired by a third party, be removed from their contracts. Their decision 
was taken to prevent the issue becoming a needless distraction from the task of ensuring that Aer Lingus maintains 
independence in line with Group strategy. On behalf of the Board, the Chairman, Colm Barrington, thanks Mr 
Mannion and Mr Coyle for this decisive action.
Commenting on the decision Mr Mannion said:
"We have no hesitation in terminating this condition with immediate effect in order to focus our attention on 
defeating the unsolicited bid from Ryanair which fundamentally undervalues Aer Lingus and is incapable of 
completion"

 LETTER FROM THE CEO OF RYANAIR
Mr Colm Barrington
 Chairman
 Aer Lingus Group plc
 Head Office
 Dublin Airport
 8 January 2009
Does Aer Lingus Really Have A Viable Independent Future?
Dear Chairman,
We  refer  to  your  22  December  letter  to  all  Aer  Lingus
 shareholders in  which you  (wrongly) claimed  that European  airline
 consolidation  is  not   really  happening  and   that  Aer   Lingus'
 "independence"  strategy   is  a   viable  alternative   to   airline
 consolidation. Since  we believe  these  claims are  patently  untrue
 perhaps you could explain to  your shareholders why you are  ignoring
 the following facts:
1.      Airline  consolidation  is accelerating  across  Europe.  Air
 France has in recent years acquired (among others) Cityjet, KLM, VLM,
 Martinair and  is  now  in  talks  to  consolidate  with  the  merged
 Alitalia/AirOne combine in Italy. Likewise, Lufthansa has acquired or
 agreed to  acquire substantial  stakes  in Swiss,  Austrian,  British
 Midland and SN Brussels. Lufthansa has also expressed its interest in
 consolidating with  Alitalia/AirOne and  is currently  in talks  with
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair letter - Does Aer Lingus Really Have a Viable Independent Future?
 SAS. BA has a  significant stake in Iberia  and both airlines are  in
 active merger discussions. Why then has Aer Lingus been bypassed  and
 ignored by this pan-European airline consolidation?
2.      Aer Lingus'  own advisor (Goldman  Sachs) doesn't believe  it
 has an independent future.  In its latest  airline research paper  (3
 Dec.  2008)  Goldman  Sachs  confirmed  its  belief  that  "it  seems
 inevitable that all European carriers will  belong to one of the  big
 three  groups  (BA,  Lufthansa  and  AF-KLM)  either  through  direct
 ownership or  deeper  alliances".  Is there  any  independent  expert
 outside of  Aer  Lingus who  has  any faith  that  your  independence
 strategy will be successful?
3.      Aer Lingus'  Chairman doesn't believe  it has an  independent
 future. In your  interview with the  Irish Times (12  Dec. 2008)  you
 "vowed to find a friendly investor who will take a majority stake  in
 the airline". You also went on  to claim that from a "consumer  point
 of view" and a  "country point of view",  Air France-KLM "would be  a
 better option  than Ryanair"  but "I  haven't got  a call  yet".  Aer
 Lingus' shareholders are entitled to a progress update on your  "vow"
 to find a friendly majority investor  and an explanation as to how  a
 friendly  majority   investor   reconciles   with   a   strategy   of
 "independence"?
4.      Aer Lingus' Chief Executive doesn't seem to believe it has an
 "independent future". In  his "keynote address"  (to the ISTT  Annual
 Conference (30 Sept-2  Oct 2008)  in Dublin)  "On the  Future of  the
 Travel Industry" Dermot Mannion suggested  that by 2015, there  could
 be just  5  large  European airlines  left,  namely  Air  France-KLM,
 BA/Iberia, Lufthansa, easyJet  and Ryanair.  Can you  explain to  Aer
 Lingus shareholders why your Chief Executive believes that Aer Lingus
 may not exist as an independent airline in just 6 years time?
Perhaps this is why Mr  Mannion has recently negotiated an  agreement
 with Aer Lingus,  which will allow  him to trigger  the payment of  a
 "failure fee" of up to EUR2.8 million  to himself if there is a  change
 in control of  Aer Lingus  and he chooses  to resign.  Why would  Aer
 Lingus or  Mr  Mannion  discuss,  negotiate or  agree  such  a  large
 "failure fee" if  either you or  Mr Mannion really  believe that  Aer
 Lingus has an "independent future"?
Yours sincerely,
Michael O'Leary
 Chief Executive

 $770 per tonne (equivalent to approx. $70 pbl of crude). As a result of this
 recent increase in its hedging position, Ryanair's average cost per tonne for
 the 50% hedged in fiscal 2009/10 is $700 (equivalent to approx. $64 pbl of
 crude).  The average cost per tonne in the current year (fiscal 2008/09) was
 $1,220 (equivalent to approx. $110 pbl of crude) for the first 3 quarters.  This
 increase in Ryanair's jet fuel hedging position will deliver, on average, a 42%
 reduction in Ryanair's hedged cost per tonne compared to the same period in
 fiscal 2008/09.
Commenting on Ryanair's extended hedging position, CEO Michael O'Leary said:
"We have taken advantage of the recent fall in fuel prices to extend our hedging
 position and we now have 50% of our requirement for the first 3 Quarters of
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Fuel Hedging Position
 fiscal 2009/2010 at $700 per tonne (equivalent to approx. $64 pbl of crude).
 This will lock in a 42% reduction of our hedged fuel cost per passenger compared
 to fiscal 2008/09, and will enable Ryanair to continue to grow traffic and
 reduce fares, during these recessionary times, when most airlines are increasing
 them".

 RYANAIR STATES AER LINGUS CLAIMS THAT ITS OFFER IS "NOT CAPABLE
 OF COMPLETION" ARE FALSE AND IN BREACH OF TAKEOVER RULES
 RYANAIR MAKES FORMAL COMPLAINT TO TAKEOVER PANEL.
Ryanair Holdings PLC today (Wednesday, 7th Jan 2009) stated that Aer
 Lingus' claims in recent media statements and in their stock exchange
 announcement issued today that the Ryanair's offer "ignores the
 substantial competition issues and is therefore not capable of
 completion" are completely false.  Ryanair believes that these false
 claims are also in breach of Takeover Rules and has today lodged a
 formal complaint with the Takeover Panel.
Commenting on these false claims Ryanair's, CEO Michael O'Leary said:
"Contrary to Aer Lingus' false claims there is no prohibition in
 place on the current offer, a point that was clearly addressed by the
 European Commission in June 2007 when Commissioner Kroes stated "the
 European Commission does not rule out a future merger between Ryanair
 Holdings plc and Aer Lingus Group plc under the right conditions".
"The reality is that the new Ryanair Offer is capable of completion,
 and Aer Lingus' claims to the contrary are false and in breach of
 Takeover Rules.  As a result, Ryanair has made a formal complaint to
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Makes Formal Complaint to Takeover Panel re: Aer Lingus Claims
 the Takeover Panel in relation to these repeated breaches of the
 Takeover Rules".

Ryanair carried over 5 million passengers in one month for the first time in May
 while  August was Ryanair's busiest month with over 5.7million passengers
 snapping up one of its guaranteed lowest fares and no fuel surcharges seats.
Ryanair called on passengers to continue to take advantage of its guaranteed
 lowest fares and no fuel surcharges by securing one of its 1MILLION EUR5 seats
 which are available for booking on www.ryanair.com until Sunday midnight, for
 travel in January, February and March.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR GROWS TO 58 MILLION PASSENGERS IN 2008
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
"Ryanair continues to attract millions of passengers with our guaranteed lowest
 fares and no fuel surcharges while also delivering Europe's number one on time
 performance, fewest lost bags and least cancelled services. We are delighted
 with our 8 million traffic growth in 2008 and aim to carry over 65 million
 passengers in 2009 as more passengers chose Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares in
 tougher economic times.
"Ryanair's 1 Million EUR5 flights for travel in January, February and March are
 sure to be snapped up so we urge passengers to log on to www.ryanair.com and
 continue to take part in the travel revolution which has seen millions of
 passengers turn their back on high cost, fuel surcharging airlines with dismal
 service performance and opt for Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares, no fuel
 surcharges and unrivalled performance".

Notice of Requisition of EGM of Aer Lingus Group plc
Dear Sirs,
As a 29.82% shareholder in Aer Lingus Group, plc (the "Company"), we
 are deeply concerned by the reported amendments to Mr Mannion's
 employment agreement summarised on page 37 of Aer Lingus' 22 December
 defence document.
We note from the version of Mr Mannion's amendment letter made
 available to us on 5 January, 2009, and which is undated by Mr
 Mannion, that he will now be entitled to claim up to EUR2.8m of
 shareholders' funds should he decide to resign following a change of
 control of the Company, even if the new owners (as is the case with
 Ryanair) are happy for him to continue in office. This "failure
 bonus" appears to us to be both excessive and indefensible.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Notice of Requisition of EGM of Aer Lingus Group plc
We believe that such arrangements - where multi-million euro sums are
 paid to Aer Lingus management at their choosing where they
 voluntarily decide to resign - are not only unprecedented, but are
 also in breach of both Irish Takeover Rules (Rule 21) and Irish
 company law (s186 and s188 of the Companies Act, 1963), unless they
 have been approved in advance by the Company's shareholders in
 general meeting.
Accordingly, we hereby requisition an Extraordinary General Meeting
 of the Company to consider, and if thought fit, pass the following
 resolutions as ordinary resolutions;
1.            That the  letter of amendment to Mr Mannion's
 employment contract awarding him a payment of up to EUR2.8m should he
 decide to resign following a change of control, be and is hereby
 revoked;
2.            That the letter of amendment to Mr Coyle's employment
 contract awarding him a payment of up to EUR1.4m should he decide to
 resign following a change of control, be and is hereby revoked;
3.            That the Board of Directors of the Company be censured
 for breaching Irish company law by failing to seek shareholder
 approval for the above  employment contract amendments prior to their
 signature by the Company.
These requisitions are made pursuant to Article 55 of the Articles of
 Association of the Company and Section 132 of the Companies Act, 1963
 (the "Act").
Please confirm in writing that you will proceed to convene the said
 meeting within 21 days of today's date in accordance with the
 Articles of Association of the Company and the Act.
Signed by:
For and on behalf of
 Ryanair Limited

Update to Shareholders on Aer Lingus Cost Improvements
Ryanair's Offer Fails to Achieve Aer Lingus Shareholder Support
In advance of a number of meetings with shareholders, Aer Lingus today provides a further update to shareholders 
in relation to its continued cost improvements and outlook for the business and its financial condition.
Fuel and Currency Hedging Positions as at 31 December 2008
Aer Lingus confirms that the fuel hedging position of the company as at 31 December 2008 is 72% cover for 2009 
at a price of US$911 per tonne; and, 22% cover for 2010 at a price of US$876 per tonne. The 2009 position has 
improved from Aer Lingus' previously disclosed position of 64% of 2009 requirements hedged at US$995.
The continued fall in fuel prices has allowed Aer Lingus to be the first transatlantic airline to eliminate fuel 
surcharges completely. The elimination of the fuel surcharge has been incorporated in the expectations of the 
Board that Aer Lingus will report a Profit in 2008 and 2009.
Aer Lingus Group Plc Statement re Shareholder Update
In addition, Aer Lingus confirms that it has hedged 100% of its dollar trading exposure for 2009 at a rate of 
US$1.48, 72% of its dollar trading exposure for 2010 at a rate of US$1.48 and 23% of its dollar trading exposure for 
2011 at a rate of US$1.42. In addition, the Company has put over US$870m of cover in place for capital 
expenditure on future aircraft deliveries at a blended rate of better than US$1.44. Finally, the Company confirms 
that cover for over 70% of its expected 2009 Sterling surplus is in place at a rate of GBP0.76 to the euro.
Cost reduction programme to deliver at least EUR50 million annual cost savings
On 8 December, 2008, Aer Lingus announced that it was on track to deliver at least EUR50 million in annual cost 
savings following the positive agreements with SIPTU and IMPACT. The process for implementing these 
agreements has not yet been completed and, therefore, the savings and associated exceptional costs of 
implementing the cost reductions have not been finalised. Aer Lingus will update shareholders on the exact costs of 
implementation once these are finalised. Further cost reductions in the areas of professional fees, marketing and 
distribution, and airport and other costs will also be delivered.
The agreements with staff, combined with a significant reduction in the cost of fuel, underpin Aer Lingus' ability to 
deliver growth for the future. The central objective of the cost reduction programme is to ensure Aer Lingus 
maintains a competitive cost base that can underpin the profitable growth of the airline. The re-opening of a 
Shannon / Heathrow service, following discussions with Aer Lingus staff and Shannon Airport Authority over a 
number of months, is a clear demonstration of this.
Pension contributions
As outlined in the IPO listing particulars and again in the Company's annual report there are two principle schemes 
(one of which is a multi-employer scheme with DAA and SR Technics (the "Main Scheme")) to which Aer Lingus 
makes fixed contributions which do not vary according to the funding level of the schemes. As the Company 
contribution rate is entirely independent of the funding levels of the schemes, the value of the schemes assets and 
liabilities are not relevant in the context of reporting under IAS 19, Retirement Benefits.
Financial outlook
Aer Lingus' guidance for 2008 remains unchanged. We expect to report a Profit despite an operating loss of 
approximately EUR20 million.
Aer Lingus also expects to report a Profit in 2009. The 2009 financial outcome includes the impact of lower net 
interest income and the benefits of the recently agreed cost reduction programme and the significant reduction in 
fuel prices. Aer Lingus' profit forecast has been independently reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers and their 
report is set out at Appendix VI of the circular to shareholders published on 22 December 2008, as required by the 
Takeover Rules.
In August, 2008, Aer Lingus guided towards a net cash balance of EUR550 million for 2009 at a time when the 
Group anticipated a significant loss in 2009, when fuel was expected to be US$117 a barrel, before any of the cost 
savings previously mentioned had been achieved, and on the basis that the two A330 purchases in 2009 - replacing 
two leased units - were debt financed.
Aer Lingus now expects significantly higher cash balances resulting from a substantially better performance in 2009 
than was anticipated in August and the positive impacts of funding arrangements available for the 2009 aircraft 
deliveries, offset by one-off cash costs associated with the implementation of our cost reduction programme. Aer 
Lingus will also incur costs in the defence of the unsolicited Offer by Ryanair. While these costs will be substantially 
below the amount incurred in the defence of Ryanair's previous unsolicited offer in 2006, Aer Lingus regrets this 
unnecessary waste of shareholder's cash especially as the Ryanair Offer is not capable of completion.
On 11 November, 2008 Aer Lingus announced a reduction to short haul capacity for the Winter 2008/09 season in 
response to economic conditions. Aer Lingus management had always planned for further growth in short haul in 
Aer Lingus Group Plc Statement re Shareholder Update
2009 and this growth will be further enhanced by the opening of the Gatwick base. The current long haul fleet is an 
8 aircraft operation and Aer Lingus expects to grow this business over the medium term.
The circular published by Aer Lingus on 22 December, 2008 further elaborates on Aer Lingus' proven track record 
and excellent prospects.
Ryanair's Offer Fails to Achieve Aer Lingus Shareholder Support
The Board notes the extremely low level of acceptances received by Ryanair in respect of its unsolicited and 
unwelcome Offer for Aer Lingus. Excluding its own holding, Ryanair has received a pathetic 0.01% acceptance 
level from Aer Lingus shareholders reflecting the unanimous view of the Aer Lingus Board that the Offer 
significantly undervalues Aer Lingus and is not capable of completion.
It is a fact that Ryanair is currently prohibited from acquiring control of Aer Lingus under the EC Merger Regulation. 
Ryanair's current offer cannot be completed until Ryanair makes a fresh submission under the EC Merger 
Regulation and obtains a clearance. Ryanair has not provided any indication of how it would construct a viable 
remedy package under the EC Merger Regulation and therefore there is no basis to believe that the Ryanair offer is 
capable of completion.
Certain terms used in this announcement, including certain technical and other terms, are defined and explained in 
the circular to shareholders published on 22 December 2008.

 RYANAIR CALLS ON AER LINGUS BOARD TO EXPLAIN
 MANNION'S EUR2.8 MILLION 'FAILURE BONUS'
[IF AER LINGUS HAS AN 'INDEPENDENT' FUTURE,
 WHY HAS MANNION A LIFEBOAT WITH EUR2.8 MILLION OF SHAREHOLDERS CASH]
Ryanair today (Sunday, 4th Jan 2009) called on the Board of Aer
 Lingus to explain why Aer Lingus' CEO Dermot Mannion has recently
 been granted an indefensible and unprecedented  EUR2.8 million 'Failure
 Bonus', if Aer Lingus undergoes a change of control.  Ryanair called
 this 'Failure Bonus' unprecedented, because it is not compensation
 for loss of office, but rather a spectacular secret bonus, which can
 be triggered by Dermot Mannion himself should he choose to resign
 immediately following a change of control of Aer Lingus.  Ryanair
 believes that this secret 'Failure Bonus' should be put to all
 shareholders for approval at Aer Lingus' next AGM, which will allow
 all shareholders (including Government, ESOT, Tailwinds and Ryanair)
 to consider whether Mr. Mannion, who has delivered substantial
 operating losses in two of the last three years (2006 and 2008),
 should be able to trigger such an excessively generous 'Failure
 Bonus'.
Commenting on today's Sunday Independent scoop, Ryanair's Chief
Ryanair Holdings PLC Call on Aer Lingus to explain Mannion's 'Failure Bonus'
 Executive Michael O'Leary, said:
 "It is extraordinary at a time when Aer Lingus is cutting jobs and
 cutting pay, that it is doing a secret deal with Dermot Mannion to
 award him a EUR2.8 million 'Failure Bonus', which he alone can trigger
 simply by resigning.
 "This secretly negotiated EUR2.8 million deal proves that Dermot
 Mannion has no faith in Aer Lingus' future as an independent
 airline.  If Dermot Mannion and the Aer Lingus Board really believed
 that Aer Lingus has an 'independent' future, then they wouldn't be
 secretly stuffing EUR2.8 million of shareholders cash into Dermot
 Mannion's resignation lifeboat.
 "The recently departed FAS Chief Executive received deserved
 criticism for his EUR500,000 resignation pay off.  He looks to have
 been short-changed by comparison with the almost EUR3 million failure
 bonus, which Dermot Mannion has secretly negotiated and can trigger
 simply by resigning.  I know of no other plc, which while cutting pay
 and jobs, is at the same time stuffing the Chief Executives lifeboat
 with EUR2.8 million of shareholders cash.
 "The Board of Aer Lingus must explain this unprecedented, unjustified
 extraordinary secret deal to all shareholders".

 LETTER FROM THE CEO OF RYANAIR
Mr Colm Barrington
 Chairman
 Aer Lingus Group plc
 Head Office
 Dublin Airport
 5 January 2009
EUR2.8m "Failure Fee" for Aer Lingus CEO
 Dear Chairman,
 According to  the Aer  Lingus Defence Document  (page 37),  Aer
 Lingus has (recently)  amended the  employment contract  of its  CEO,
 Dermot Mannion, by agreeing to allow him to claim a "failure fee"  of
 up to EUR2.8 million should he  decide to resign following a change  of
 control in Aer Lingus, even if  the group's new owners are happy  for
 him to continue in office (as Ryanair is). This amendment was  agreed
 without Aer  Lingus  shareholder approval  or  the clearance  of  the
 Takeover Panel and so  appears to be in  breach of both the  Takeover
 Rules and Irish company law.
We believe  all Aer Lingus  shareholders would appreciate,  and
 are entitled to, answers to the following questions:
1.      The copy of this agreement made available by Aer Lingus  (for
Ryanair Holdings PLC LETTER FROM THE CEO OF RYANAIR
 inspection  by  all  shareholders  at  the  offices  of  Arthur  Cox,
 Earlsfort Centre, Dublin 2) is unsigned and undated. Why?
2.      Please confirm when  this agreement was  approved by the  Aer
 Lingus Board and  executed by Mr  Mannion. If it  was only  concluded
 following the Ryanair Offer (of 1  December, last), do you intend  to
 seek the approval of the  Takeover Panel and Aer Lingus  shareholders
 for this agreement?
3.      If Aer Lingus has an independent future as both yourself  and
 Mr Mannion have  claimed ("an  independent strong Aer  Lingus is  the
 right way to go"),  why does the Board  believe it is appropriate  to
 allow Mr Mannion to receive a "failure fee" of up to EUR2.8 million  if
 Aer Lingus  does not  remain independent  and he  chooses to  resign?
 Isn't this agreement  just a  reward for  failure which  demonstrates
 that Mr Mannion does not believe  that Aer Lingus has an  independent
 future?
4.      Please confirm to all Aer Lingus shareholders the details  of
 any  other  unlawful  payments,  "sweetheart"  deals  and/or  "golden
 parachute" arrangements entered  into by  Aer Lingus  with its  Board
 members and management.
Yours sincerely,
Michael O'Leary
 Chief Executive
The following statements and information are included in this letter
 in accordance with the requirements of the Irish Takeover Rules.
The directors of Ryanair and Coinside (a wholly owned subsidiary of
 Ryanair and the company making the Offer) accept responsibility for
 the information contained in this letter, save that the only
 responsibility accepted by the directors of Ryanair and Coinside in
 respect of the information contained herein relating to Aer Lingus
 and the Aer Lingus Group, which has been compiled from published
 sources, has been to ensure that such information has been correctly
 and fairly reproduced or presented (and no steps have been taken by
 the directors of Ryanair or Coinside to verify such information). To
 the best of the knowledge and belief of the directors of Ryanair and
 Coinside (having taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the
 case), the information contained herein for which the directors of
 Ryanair and Coinside accept responsibility is in accordance with the
 facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such
 information.
Reference to Mr Mannion's termination compensation payment is
 calculated by reference to (i) 2008 basic salary of EUR440,000; plus
 (ii) 150% (of basic salary) annual performance related bonus
 totalling EUR660,000; plus (iii) pension contribution totalling
 EUR312,000 for 2007; plus (iv) car bonus of EUR32,500; all sourced from
Ryanair Holdings PLC LETTER FROM THE CEO OF RYANAIR
 Aer Lingus' defence document dated 22 December 2008 (pages 36 and
 37).
Mr Mannion's statement that "an independent strong Aer Lingus is the
 right way to go" was made during a radio interview with Cathal
 MacCoille for the Morning Ireland Show on 9 December 2008.

Aer Lingus Response to Ryanair Offer
Aer Lingus shareholders advised to reject unsolicited offer
The board of Aer Lingus announces today that it is posting a circular setting out its detailed response to Ryanair's 
offer of 15 December 2008. The Directors believe that the Ryanair offer significantly undervalues Aer Lingus and 
unanimously recommend that Aer Lingus shareholders take no action in relation to the offer.
In its response to the Ryanair Offer the board of Aer Lingus highlighted that Aer Lingus:
-- Is a Profitable Business
-- Has a Clear Strategy for Profitable Growth
-- Has Unmatched Financial Strength
-- Has Delivered on Its Promises
-- Has a Vibrant Independent Future and does not need Ryanair
Aer Lingus Chairman, Colm Barrington has written to all shareholders as follows:
"22 December
Aer Lingus Group Plc Offer Rejection
Dear Shareholder,
On 1 December, 2008 Ryanair announced that it was making an offer for your company at EUR1.40 per share, and 
has since posted its Offer Document to you. The Board considered and unanimously rejected the Offer.
This letter sets out why you should reject Ryanair's opportunistic Offer. The Offer fundamentally undervalues Aer 
Lingus, its robust financial position and strong growth prospects. The Offer also misrepresents the significant 
progress of Aer Lingus since the IPO in 2006 and seeks to undermine Aer Lingus' vibrant future as an independent 
airline.
The Aer Lingus business model is succeeding
Since I was appointed as Chairman of Aer Lingus in October 2008, I have been hugely impressed by the 
management team's successes and determination to continue to develop the Aer Lingus business in challenging 
markets.
Our short haul business model offers low fares which compete with those of other low cost carriers, while delivering 
a compelling product and superior service that passengers value. This business continues to grow and to generate 
high returns on capital. We are clearly meeting customer needs and meeting competition head-on. We cannot allow 
Ryanair to take Aer Lingus' superior brand and customer proposition at a price that fundamentally undervalues our 
business.
In 2007 we expanded Aer Lingus' bases outside the Republic of Ireland for the first time and we have now 
announced a significant new base at London Gatwick. We are extremely excited by this expansion into one of 
Europe's key markets, which has the potential to significantly increase our short haul business and, in turn, 
substantially increase our income, further reducing our unit costs and delivering a high return on your capital.
Our long haul business also continues to grow. We have increased capacity by 30% since the IPO. Our long haul 
service has proven itself against the large US carriers on the Ireland / transatlantic market, and we consistently 
achieve the largest share of this market. We continue to develop strategic alliances with partners such as United 
Airlines and jetBlue to facilitate further development of the long haul business.
The Aer Lingus business model has consistently generated high levels of return since the IPO in 2006 and we 
expect this to continue with the expansion of the business in Ireland and beyond.
Aer Lingus is and will be profitable
2008 has been a very difficult year for all airlines worldwide, as a result of the major increase in fuel prices 
experienced during the year and broader economic uncertainty. IATA, the global air transport organisation, predicts 
that the global airline industry will lose US$5 billion in 2008. Despite these extremely challenging conditions, we 
expect to achieve Profit overall in 2008.
While maintaining revenue is crucial, we expect that significantly reduced fuel prices and a number of management 
cost reduction initiatives will enable Aer Lingus to continue to enhance profitability in 2009 and beyond. I would like 
to highlight the recent agreements with SIPTU and IMPACT as a defining moment for Aer Lingus - our employees 
have cooperatively agreed significant changes in work practices and reductions in costs which will allow the airline 
to grow further and will underpin both employment and profitability in the future. As a first step we have 
recommenced operations between Shannon and Heathrow which along with our other London routes will provide 
an important level of business connectivity between London and the west of Ireland.
Aer Lingus has unmatched financial strength
Aer Lingus has a strong balance sheet - one of the strongest in the industry - with total cash reserves of EUR1.3 
billion and net cash of EUR803 million.
Aer Lingus Group Plc Offer Rejection
Ryanair seeks to pay other shareholders EUR525 million to acquire control of Aer Lingus in order to gain access to 
this EUR1.3 billion cash balance. For this reason alone, the Offer is worthy of rejection. That is before considering 
the market value of our owned fleet of EUR601 million. That is also before considering the value of our other assets 
including Heathrow slots, our fleet orders, our brand, our successful operations and our strong market position.
Aer Lingus does not need Ryanair
Aer Lingus has proven that it can compete with major flag carriers on the one hand and low cost operators on the 
other. This is not a model to be sacrificed for the benefit of Ryanair and its shareholders.
Ryanair has no experience of managing a long haul business. Ryanair has no experience of managing a business 
that offers a superior customer proposition. In fact, it delights in not doing so. Ryanair has no experience of 
managing a unionised workforce in Ireland, and has publicly ridiculed and shown its contempt for employee unions. 
Ryanair's entire experience and focus has been on developing a low fares, low service short haul product.
Ryanair claims that Aer Lingus needs Ryanair to survive and to continue to grow. This is emphatically not the case. 
Aer Lingus has grown strongly in the face of direct and aggressive competition from Ryanair for over twenty years. 
Ryanair seeks to gain opportunity and value from what Aer Lingus has created.
Ryanair's proposition is simple - it is opportunistically attempting to capitalise on current market fears and 
uncertainties to profit from our proven business model and gain access to our huge cash resources and valuable 
assets. Do not let this rip-off happen.
Alternatives to airline consolidation
It has been stated by Ryanair that airline consolidation is happening at a pace in Europe and that such 
consolidation justifies, and indeed requires, that Ryanair be joined with Aer Lingus. This is factually incorrect. Since 
the acquisition of KLM by Air France in October 2003, the European mergers of size that have actually completed 
have involved failing airlines needing to be rescued.
It is simply untrue that Aer Lingus is a uniquely isolated airline incapable of an independent future. The liberalisation 
of airline regulations in Europe has resulted in the development of a vibrant regional European airline industry. 
Airline failures in 2008 have generally been among the smaller, poorly financed and weaker airlines. Aer Lingus, 
with its 10 million passengers, its 106 routes, its 42 aircraft, and its EUR1.3 billion in the bank, is not one of these 
weak carriers. Aer Lingus does not need to be rescued by Ryanair!
In fact, Ryanair has failed to give a coherent explanation on where it stands on consolidation. On the one hand it 
bases the entire logic of the Offer as being a need to combine forces to create one Irish airline, and on the other 
hand Ryanair has argued that Aer Lingus will be separate from, and not managed by, Ryanair! Is it credible that 
Ryanair is really going to allow Aer Lingus to operate separately, with the existing management team, employees 
and business? What is Ryanair adding? We don't believe Ryanair. It will be a monopoly. It will be a monopoly that 
will flatter to deceive and give meaningless guarantees. That is what monopolies do.
The Offer is diversionary and flawed
Ryanair's first bid for Aer Lingus was fatally flawed - and Ryanair has publicly acknowledged this. The European 
Commission ruled against Ryanair's last bid for Aer Lingus because of the anti-competitive nature of the combined 
entity. The Board sees no reason to believe the Commission would change its view, particularly as the level of 
competition between Aer Lingus and Ryanair has increased and a number of airlines have withdrawn from Irish 
routes in the interim. Ryanair's appeal of this ruling is still outstanding.
Ryanair's posturing around this lower bid is pointless, and, we believe, will ultimately prove futile. Ryanair has not 
offered any new remedies nor provided any new evidence that clearance could be achieved. It has at its heart the 
same flaws in relation to shareholder value, passenger choice and credibility as its original diversionary attempt in 
2006.
Aer Lingus Group Plc Offer Rejection
In the longer term, we believe that Ryanair's maintenance of a 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus - and use of this 
position to continue to harass Aer Lingus commercially in order to deflect Aer Lingus management from its 
continued progress - is a gross breach of the principles of competition. This distraction and the considerable 
expense incurred in responding to the unsolicited offer, especially in the absence of a comprehensive competition 
solution being provided by Ryanair, is to the significant detriment of Aer Lingus' other shareholders. Aer Lingus 
continues to pursue remedies to this situation.

Additional Information
1.Opinion of Aer Lingus Board on Ryanair's Plans for Aer Lingus and Its Employees
The views of the Board and management of Aer Lingus on the Offer generally are expressed in the Letter from the 
Chairman of Aer Lingus and the quote from the Chief Executive of Aer Lingus. In addition, as required by the 
Takeover Rules, the Board's views on the effects of implementation of the Offer on all of Aer Lingus' interests 
(including, specifically, employment), and on Ryanair's strategic plans for Aer Lingus and the likely repercussions of 
such plans on employment and on the locations of Aer Lingus' places of business are set out below.
1.1.Heathrow Slots
During the course of its 2006 Offer, Ryanair publicly stated that it would retain Aer Lingus' Heathrow slots, but 
privately agreed to surrender Heathrow slots owned by Aer Lingus to persuade the European Commission to 
approve its offer. In light of this, the Board of Aer Lingus believes that Ryanair's statements made during the course 
of this Offer with respect to the Heathrow slots cannot be relied upon. Furthermore, the Board has received legal 
advice that the "irrevocable contractual commitments" and "legally binding guarantee" in relation to the Heathrow 
slots referred to in the Offer Document are unenforceable.

 RYANAIR QUESTIONS AER LINGUS PROFITABILITY
 EXPECTS NET LOSS IN 2008 (THE SECOND SUCH LOSS IN 3 YEARS '06-'08)
Aer Lingus demonstrated again today (Monday, 22nd December 2008) that
 shareholders cannot trust an Aer Lingus defence document.
Commenting on Aer Lingus' defence document, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"Aer Lingus have once again shown they cannot be trusted. Aer Lingus today
 claim that "we expect to achieve profit overall in 2008".  Unfortunately for Aer
 Lingus shareholders, the reality is that Aer Lingus has incurred substantial
 - as yet undisclosed - exceptional costs, and companies have to pay tax, so the
 result will be another year of substantial net losses.  It beggars belief that
 Aer Lingus claim - just one week before their year end - they do not yet know
 the exceptional costs for 2008 (while still making a forecast), and it is
 insulting to Aer Lingus shareholders to pretend that the business is operating
 at a profit, when it is clearly going to make a substantial net loss this
 year."
Ryanair believes this continues a long history of Aer Lingus' false promises to
 its shareholders.  In its 2006 Aer Lingus defence document, Aer Lingus Group plc
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Questions Aer Lingus Profitability
 promised it was:
1.  "Committed to reduce unit costs" (yet operating costs per pax have risen 18% in
 the last 2½ years).
 2.  "Has excellent prospects as an independent carrier" (yet today EU independent
 carriers are rapidly consolidating).
 3.  "Superior returns justify a premium rating" (Aer Lingus' negative returns have
 led to a rating collapse).
 4.  "Will deliver future value through profitable growth" (Ryanair believes this
 growth has delivered substantial net losses in 2008).
 5.  "Expects to add significant value" (shareholders saw over EUR960m of value lost
 between Nov'06 and Nov'08).
Today Aer Lingus has produced a Defence Document which continues this policy of
 misleading shareholders as follows:
1.  Aer Lingus' Defence Document claimed it made profits in 2006 and again in 2007,
 yet Aer Lingus' annual report shows it made a loss after tax of EUR70m in 2006.
 The Board of Ryanair rejects Aer Lingus' claim that "we expect to achieve profit
 overall in 2008.  This claim is Ryanair believes a false one.
 2.  In Aer Lingus' 11 November 2008 Interim Statement, the company confirmed it
 would make an operating loss in 2008 of "closer to EUR20m".  When recent
 additional costs, including (a) the reported EUR100m cost of Aer Lingus'
 transformational deal, (b) its defence costs of the Ryanair offer, and (c) the
 cost of its above market fuel hedging arrangements, Ryanair believes that Aer
 Lingus' net loss (after tax) in 2008 will be substantial.
Ryanair now calls on Aer Lingus to reply to the 7 simple questions set out in
 Ryanair's (18 Dec 2008) letter to Aer Lingus' Chairman.  These specific
 questions relate to Aer Lingus' net losses in 2008 and 2009 and call for
 clarification of Aer Lingus' previous guidance to shareholders that its net cash
 balance will decline to "about EUR550m" by the end of 2009.  Ryanair has attached
 a copy of this letter to this press release and now calls on Aer Lingus again to
 answer these 7 simple questions openly and honestly for all shareholders.
Ends.

 OPEN
 LETTER
Dear Chairman,
We refer to Aer Lingus' recent interim
 management statement dated 11 Nov 08 and the subsequent comments and claims made
 by Aer Lingus group management following the launch of Ryanair's recent merger
 offer. We, as a large shareholder, are concerned about some of these apparently
 contradictory claims and forecasts, and their impact upon Aer Lingus' forecast
 post exceptional net profit (loss) after tax for 2008 and 2009.
We
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Questions Aer Lingus Profitability
 believe all shareholders would appreciate and are entitled to receive a detailed
 clarification of the impact of the following items on Aer Lingus' forecast post
 exceptional net profit (loss) after tax, and net cash balances, for 2008 and
 2009.
1.       How much cash compensation and exceptional costs have
 been, or will be, incurred to deliver the recently announced "transformational
 deal"?  Is the reported cost of EUR100m an accurate one, or is the final cost
 greater than this figure? Please confirm for all shareholders that this
 "transformation" will only reduce Aer Lingus' costs by as little as EUR5 per
 passenger.
2.      We note that a similar team (to that in 2006), led
 by Goldman Sachs, has been appointed by Aer Lingus to defend Ryanair's current
 merger offer. Since Aer Lingus previously spent over EUR24m of shareholder funds
 defending a higher offer (in Oct 2006), can the company confirm for all
 shareholders the amount of the cap, referred to by you before the parliamentary
 committee today, which has been placed on Aer Lingus' defence costs this time
 around.
3.      Can the company confirm for all shareholders the
 current (Dec 2008) deficit in the Aer Lingus defined benefit pension schemes?
 In light of the recent collapse in Irish pension scheme valuations, can the
 company confirm that its pension schemes are fully funded or will a further
 exceptional cost increase (in the form of pension contribution top ups) be
 required by Aer Lingus Group plc to fund the hole in its pension
 schemes?
4.      Since the company last week announced that it would
 eliminate long haul fuel surcharges with immediate effect, can the  company
 please confirm for all shareholders the impact of this revenue loss on Aer
 Lingus' forecast post exceptional net profit (loss) after tax for 2008 and
 2009.
5.      Since Aer Lingus Group plc has previously forecast an
 operating loss of approx. EUR20m in 2008 (11 Nov interim statement)  and another
 operating loss of approx. EUR70m in 2009 (investor conference call 28th Aug 2008),
 can the company, in light of the above substantial cost increases and revenue
 reductions, please confirm its forecast post exceptional net profit (loss) after
 tax for both 2008 and 2009.
6.      During the course of Aer Lingus'
 most recent investor conference call (28th Aug 2008), the company forecast that
 its net  cash balance would decline to "about EUR550m" by the end of 2009. In
 light of the impact of: (i) the substantial cost increases outlined above,  (ii)
 the loss of revenue arising from the elimination of fuel surcharges, (iii) the
 impact of the company's current fuel hedges, (iv) the compensation cost for the
 recent "transformational deal", and (v) the company's expected defence fees, can
 the company please confirm for all shareholders its revised forecast net cash
 balances at year end 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2009.
7.     Can
 the company please explain to all shareholders the apparent contradiction
 between Aer Lingus' interim statement of just 5 weeks ago (11 Nov 2008) (in
 which Aer Lingus announced capacity reductions on its long haul and short haul
 network) with its recent statements to the media and at today's parliamentary
 committee of a campaign of growth in 2009. Can the company please confirm for
 all shareholders its revised capacity and capex forecast for 2009 and its impact
 on the company's forecast net cash balance of "about EUR550m" by the end of
 2009.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Questions Aer Lingus Profitability

Body
 During his appearance on "The Late Late Show" on 5 December 2008, Michael O'Leary said that Ryanair was 
"going to guarantee to create a thousand new jobs in Aer Lingus by doubling their fleet in the next five years" and 
indicated that a "promise" would be given to the Irish government to deliver these jobs in Ireland. No such 
guarantee or promise is included in the Offer Document. Aer Lingus' Board believes that the jobs referred to are the 
same 1,000 jobs that Ryanair previously promised to create in its own business, now transferred to Aer Lingus, and 
that Ryanair's failure to offer a guarantee of its intentions is evidence of the lack of seriousness of its "promise".
During the 2006 Offer, Ryanair told the EU Commission that it would achieve efficiencies at Aer Lingus by reducing 
the size of its work force by 1,000 to 1,500 employees; in light of this, the Aer Lingus Board believes that Ryanair's 
statement in this Offer Document of its "plans" to create 1,000 jobs is nothing more than a cynical ploy on the part 
of Ryanair to win support from the employee shareholders in Aer Lingus.
1.3. Aer Lingus' Brand
Aer Lingus' brand would be tarnished by association with Ryanair. While consumers associate Aer Lingus with 
value-for-money and superior service, they associate Ryanair with no frills.
1.4.Aer Lingus' Fleet
Aer Lingus is committed to obtaining a superior return on its assets. Aer Lingus' fleet expansion plans are outlined 
in this document and the Board of Aer Lingus believes that its prudent approach to growing Aer Lingus' business 
while maintaining a superior return on its fleet investments is preferable to Ryanair's "commitment" to double the 
size of the Aer Lingus short haul fleet over the next 5 years without regard to the profitability or sustainability of such 
expansion.
1.5.Short Haul Fares
Aer Lingus Group Plc Offer Rejection -6-
Aer Lingus' short haul fares fell by 6.1% in the trailing 12 months to 30 September 2008. In the opinion of Aer 
Lingus' Board, this demonstrates that Ryanair's "guarantee" to cut Aer Lingus' short haul fares is unnecessary and 
indeed an empty promise.
1.6.Fuel Surcharges on Long Haul Flights
On the day that the Offer Document was issued, Aer Lingus no longer had any fuel surcharges on its long haul 
flights, which makes Ryanair's undertaking in the Offer Document to "eliminate Aer Lingus' long haul fuel 
surcharges on Completion" unnecessary and misleading.
1.7.Long Haul Service
Ryanair has no experience of operating or expertise in developing a long haul service. Aer Lingus' existing long 
haul service has the largest market share in the Irish transatlantic market. Aer Lingus is infinitely better placed than 
Ryanair to grow and develop Aer Lingus' long haul business.

Body
 Our short haul business model offers low fares which compete with those of other low cost carriers, while delivering 
a compelling product and superior service that passengers value. This business continues to grow and to generate 
high returns on capital. We are clearly meeting customer needs and meeting competition head-on. We cannot allow 
Ryanair to take Aer Lingus' superior brand and customer proposition at a price that fundamentally undervalues our 
business.
In 2007 we expanded Aer Lingus' bases outside the Republic of Ireland for the first time and we have now 
announced a significant new base at London Gatwick. We are extremely excited by this expansion into one of 
Europe's key markets, which has the potential to significantly increase our short haul business and, in turn, 
substantially increase our income, further reducing our unit costs and delivering a high return on your capital.
Our long haul business also continues to grow. We have increased capacity by 30% since the IPO. Our long haul 
service has proven itself against the large US carriers on the Ireland/transatlantic market, and we consistently 
achieve the largest share of this market. We continue to develop strategic alliances with partners such as United 
Airlines and jetBlue to facilitate further development of the long haul business.
The Aer Lingus business model has consistently generated high levels of return since the IPO in 2006 and we 
expect this to continue with the expansion of the business in Ireland and beyond.
Aer Lingus is and will be profitable
2008 has been a very difficult year for all airlines worldwide, as a result of the major increase in fuel prices 
experienced during the year and broader economic uncertainty. IATA, the global air transport organisation, predicts 
that the global airline industry will lose US$5 billion in 2008. Despite these extremely challenging conditions, we 
expect to achieve Profit overall in 2008.
While maintaining revenue is crucial, we expect that significantly reduced fuel prices and a number of management 
cost reduction initiatives will enable Aer Lingus to continue to enhance profitability in 2009 and beyond. I would like 
Aer Lingus Group Plc Offer Rejection -3-
to highlight the recent agreements with SIPTU and IMPACT as a defining moment for Aer Lingus - our employees 
have cooperatively agreed significant changes in work practices and reductions in costs which will allow the airline 
to grow further and will underpin both employment and profitability in the future. As a first step we have 
recommenced operations between Shannon and Heathrow which along with our other London routes will provide 
an important level of business connectivity between London and the west of Ireland.
Aer Lingus has unmatched financial strength
Aer Lingus has a strong balance sheet - one of the strongest in the industry - with total cash reserves of EUR1.3 
billion and net cash of EUR803 million.
Ryanair seeks to pay other shareholders EUR525 million to acquire control of Aer Lingus in order to gain access to 
this EUR1.3 billion cash balance. For this reason alone, the Offer is worthy of rejection. That is before considering 
the market value of our owned fleet of EUR601 million. That is also before considering the value of our other assets 
including Heathrow slots, our fleet orders, our brand, our successful operations and our strong market position.
Aer Lingus does not need Ryanair
Aer Lingus has proven that it can compete with major flag carriers on the one hand and low cost operators on the 
other. This is not a model to be sacrificed for the benefit of Ryanair and its shareholders.
Ryanair has no experience of managing a long haul business. Ryanair has no experience of managing a business 
that offers a superior customer proposition. In fact, it delights in not doing so. Ryanair has no experience of 
managing a unionised workforce in Ireland, and has publicly ridiculed and shown its contempt for employee unions. 
Ryanair's entire experience and focus has been on developing a low fares, low service short haul product.
Ryanair claims that Aer Lingus needs Ryanair to survive and to continue to grow. This is emphatically not the case. 
Aer Lingus has grown strongly in the face of direct and aggressive competition from Ryanair for over twenty years. 
Ryanair seeks to gain opportunity and value from what Aer Lingus has created.
Ryanair's proposition is simple - it is opportunistically attempting to capitalise on current market fears and 
uncertainties to profit from our proven business model and gain access to our huge cash resources and valuable 
assets. Do not let this rip-off happen.
Alternatives to airline consolidation
It has been stated by Ryanair that airline consolidation is happening at a pace in Europe and that such 
consolidation justifies, and indeed requires, that Ryanair be joined with Aer Lingus. This is factually incorrect. Since 
the acquisition of KLM by Air France in October 2003, the European mergers of size that have actually completed 
have involved failing airlines needing to be rescued.
It is simply untrue that Aer Lingus is a uniquely isolated airline incapable of an independent future. The liberalisation 
of airline regulations in Europe has resulted in the development of a vibrant regional European airline industry. 
Airline failures in 2008 have generally been among the smaller, poorly financed and weaker airlines. Aer Lingus, 
with its 10 million passengers, its 106 routes, its 42 aircraft, and its EUR1.3 billion in the bank, is not one of these 
weak carriers. Aer Lingus does not need to be rescued by Ryanair!
In fact, Ryanair has failed to give a coherent explanation on where it stands on consolidation. On the one hand it 
bases the entire logic of the Offer as being a need to combine forces to create one Irish airline, and on the other 
hand Ryanair has argued that Aer Lingus will be separate from, and not managed by, Ryanair! Is it credible that 
Ryanair is really going to allow Aer Lingus to operate separately, with the existing management team, employees 
and business? What is Ryanair adding? We don't believe Ryanair. It will be a monopoly. It will be a monopoly that 
will flatter to deceive and give meaningless guarantees. That is what monopolies do.
The Offer is diversionary and flawed
Aer Lingus Group Plc Offer Rejection -3-
Ryanair's first bid for Aer Lingus was fatally flawed - and Ryanair has publicly acknowledged this. The European 
Commission ruled against Ryanair's last bid for Aer Lingus because of the anti-competitive nature of the combined 
entity. The Board sees no reason to believe the Commission would change its view, particularly as the level of 
competition between Aer Lingus and Ryanair has increased and a number of airlines have withdrawn from Irish 
routes in the interim. Ryanair's appeal of this ruling is still outstanding.
Ryanair's posturing around this lower bid is pointless, and, we believe, will ultimately prove futile. Ryanair has not 
offered any new remedies nor provided any new evidence that clearance could be achieved. It has at its heart the 
same flaws in relation to shareholder value, passenger choice and credibility as its original diversionary attempt in 
2006.
In the longer term, we believe that Ryanair's maintenance of a 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus - and use of this 
position to continue to harass Aer Lingus commercially in order to deflect Aer Lingus management from its 
continued progress - is a gross breach of the principles of competition. This distraction and the considerable 
expense incurred in responding to the unsolicited offer, especially in the absence of a comprehensive competition 
solution being provided by Ryanair, is to the significant detriment of Aer Lingus' other shareholders. Aer Lingus 
continues to pursue remedies to this situation.
Take no action
Ignore Ryanair's threats, contradictions and insinuations. Aer Lingus is a strong, growing, cash-rich and valuable 
airline that is dedicated to providing its customers with choice and with a high quality product, its employees with a 
vibrant workplace and its shareholders with superior returns. Do not hand over this value to our main competitor. 
Reject Ryanair's bid.
The Directors believe that Ryanair's Offer does not reflect the true value of the company based on its market 
position, its fleet, its cash and its brand. These assets will produce greater value for our shareholders in the future. 
The Directors, who have been so advised by Goldman Sachs International and Boodbody Corporate Finance, 
believe that the Offer significantly undervalues Aer Lingus. In providing advice to the Directors, Goldman Sachs 
International and Boodbody Corporate Finance have relied upon the commercial assessments of the Directors.
Accordingly, the Directors unanimously recommend that you take no action in relation to the Offer. The Directors 
will not be accepting the Offer in respect of their own legal and beneficial holdings of Aer Lingus Shares.
The way to reject the Offer is to take no action. Do not sign any document which Ryanair or its advisers send you.
Yours faithfully,
Colm BarringtonChairman
No Better Competitor
"Aer Lingus is one of the most successful airlines in Europe in the way it has transformed its business model to 
profitably compete in the ultra-competitive low fare short haul market.
Although we are a low fare airline, Aer Lingus still provides a superior service offering with a strong brand and 
leading market position, and this has been the platform for profitable growth.
We have grown our fleet by 20% to 42 aircraft since the IPO in late 2006, and have additional orders for a further 
12. Passenger numbers have increased by over 17% since the IPO. Growth has been achieved in both our short 
haul and long haul businesses.
In relation to our short haul business, load factors are very robust in the face of both intense competition and the 
challenging economic environment. Our load factor was 77.6% in the 11 months to end November 2008.

 Since 2006 our short haul route network has increased from 75 to 95. At the same time, Ryanair has withdrawn 
year-round services on no less than 34 routes from Ireland. No airline can compete better with Ryanair than Aer 
Lingus.
In common with all transatlantic carriers, our long haul business has been adversely affected by the global 
recession. We have a range of initiatives underway to turn this around including a web-enabled revenue alliance 
with jetBlue since 03 April 2008 and our United Airlines code share agreement on all long haul since from 1 
November 2008. In addition, we are confident the status of Aer Lingus as the largest tenant for Dublin Airport 
Terminal 2 (opening in 2010) will uniquely position us to benefit from increased long haul traffic flows through 
enhanced connectivity.
Overall, our model is continuing to achieve high returns on capital. Despite the current environment, we anticipate 
that Aer Lingus will break even at an operating profit level in the second half of 2008 - this in a year where the 
industry is suffering massive losses. Aer Lingus will continue to be a strong and profitable airline in 2009, with 
significant resources and a platform for future growth.
We are working hard to reduce costs. Disciplined control has resulted in unit costs excluding fuel falling by 10% 
since 2006. Recently, we announced an agreement with our staff that will result in EUR50 million in annualised 
savings. With the commitment of management and staff, we will continue to deliver on our track record of strong 
financial performance which will drive tangible shareholder value.
I am privileged to lead one of Europe's success stories in the aviation market. Other airlines look to Aer Lingus as a 
model for successful transformation. I am not prepared to see our heritage, our special brand, current success and 
potential for future profitability be expropriated for the benefit of Ryanair's shareholders. Ryanair is opportunistically 
attempting to buy our profitable route network, gain access to our strong balance sheet, and secure a monopoly in 
one of its largest markets.
Don't let this happen.Reject the offer by taking no action."

 Ignore Ryanair's threats, contradictions and insinuations. Aer Lingus is a strong, growing, cash-rich and valuable 
airline that is dedicated to providing its customers with choice and with a high quality product, its employees with a 
vibrant workplace and its shareholders with superior returns. Do not hand over this value to our main competitor. 
Reject Ryanair's bid.
The Directors believe that Ryanair's Offer does not reflect the true value of the company based on its market 
position, its fleet, its cash and its brand. These assets will produce greater value for our shareholders in the future. 
The Directors, who have been so advised by Goldman Sachs International and Goodbody Corporate Finance, 
believe that the Offer significantly undervalues Aer Lingus. In providing advice to the Directors, Goldman Sachs 
International and Goodbody Corporate Finance have relied upon the commercial assessments of the Directors.
Accordingly, the Directors unanimously recommend that you take no action in relation to the Offer. The Directors 
will not be accepting the Offer in respect of their own legal and beneficial holdings of Aer Lingus Shares.
The way to reject the Offer is to take no action. Do not sign any document which Ryanair or its advisers send you.
Yours faithfully,
Colm BarringtonChairman"
The circular published today and reproduced below further elaborates on Aer Lingus' proven track record and 
excellent prospects.

From the Chairman
22 December 2008
Dear Shareholder,
On 1 December 2008 Ryanair announced that it was making an offer for your company at EUR1.40 per share, and 
has since posted its Offer Document to you. The Board considered and unanimously rejected the Offer.
This letter sets out why you should reject Ryanair's opportunistic Offer. The Offer fundamentally undervalues Aer 
Lingus, its robust financial position and strong growth prospects. The Offer also misrepresents the significant 
progress of Aer Lingus since the IPO in 2006 and seeks to undermine Aer Lingus' vibrant future as an independent 
airline.
The Aer Lingus business model is succeeding
Since I was appointed as Chairman of Aer Lingus in October 2008, I have been hugely impressed by the 
management team's successes and determination to continue to develop the Aer Lingus business in challenging 
markets.

Directors. The Minister for Transport of Ireland is entitled to nominate for appointment up to three Directors. The

Fleet Valuation Report
December 18, 2008
 Aer Lingus Group plc
 Head Office
 Dublin Airport
 Ireland
Dear Sirs,
AVITAS, Inc. has been retained by Aer Lingus, (the "Client") to provide its opinion as to the Market Value as at 
December 18, 2008 for twenty one (21) Airbus aircraft. The subject aircraft are identified and their values are set 
forth in Figure 1 on page Three.
In determining the values, AVITAS has not had the opportunity to recently inspect the subject aircraft nor review 
their related technical documentation. Consequently, unless otherwise stated, we use the following assumptions for 
each aircraft in our valuation:
-- It is in good physical condition
-- It is in half-life, half-time condition with regard to the airframe,
 engines, landing gear and other critical components, unless the
 aircraft is new or nearly new
-- It is in passenger configuration
-- It is operated under the air transport regulations of a major nation
 the historical maintenance documentation has been properly controlled
 under internationally recognized standards
-- It is in compliance with all mandatory airworthiness directives
-- Its specifications and modification status are comparable to other
 aircraft of its type and age
-- Its utilization rate is similar to that of other aircraft of its type
 and age
The values presented in this report do not take into consideration fleet sales, attached leases, tax considerations or 
other factors that might be considered in structuring the terms and conditions of a specific transaction. These 
factors do not directly affect the value of the aircraft itself but can affect the economics of the transaction. Therefore, 
the negotiated striking price in an aircraft transaction may take into consideration factors such as the present value 
of the future lease stream, the terms and conditions of the specific lease agreement and the impact of tax 
considerations.
Definitions
AVITAS's value definition conforms to those of the International Society of Transport Aircraft Trading ("ISTAT") 
adopted in January 1994, and is summarized as follows:
-- Market Value (or Current Market Value if the value
 pertains to the time of the analysis) is the appraiser's opinion of
Aer Lingus Group Plc Offer Rejection -14-
 the most likely trading price that may be generated for an aircraft
 under the market conditions that are perceived to exist at the time in
 question. Market Value assumes that the aircraft is valued for its
 highest, best use, that the parties to the hypothetical transaction
 are willing, able, prudent and knowledgeable, and under no unusual
 pressure for a prompt sale, and that the transaction would be
 negotiated in an open and unrestricted market on an arm s-length
 basis, for a single-unit, for cash or equivalent consideration, and
 given an adequate amount of time for effective exposure to prospective
 buyers. Market Value assumes that an aircraft's physical condition is
 average for an aircraft of its type and age, and its maintenance time
 status is at mid-life, mid-time (or benefiting from an above-average
 maintenance status if it is new or nearly new). Market Value is
 synonymous with Fair Market Value in that both reflect the state of
 supply and demand in the market that exists at the time.
Aircraft Values
AVITAS's opinion as to the value of the subject aircraft is presented below in millions of Euro, having been 
converted from US dollars at the Client requested exchange rate of one Euro = US dollar 1.350.

 Ryanair Holdings PLC
 19 December 2008
 ab/MOL/12046
18 December 2008
Mr Colm
 Barrington
 Chairman
 Aer Lingus Group plc
 Head Office
 Dublin
 Airport      OPEN LETTER
Dear Chairman,
We refer to Aer Lingus'
 recent interim management statement dated 11 Nov 08 and the subsequent comments
 and claims made by Aer Lingus group management following the launch of Ryanair's
 recent merger offer. We, as a large shareholder, are concerned about some of
 these apparently contradictory claims and forecasts, and their impact upon Aer
 Lingus' forecast post exceptional net profit (loss) after tax for 2008 and
 2009.
We believe all shareholders would appreciate and are entitled to
 receive a detailed clarification of the impact of the following items on Aer
Ryanair Holdings PLC Shareholder Letter to Aer Lingus Chairman
 Lingus' forecast post exceptional net profit (loss) after tax, and net cash
 balances, for 2008 and 2009.
1.       How much cash compensation and
 exceptional costs have been, or will be, incurred to deliver the recently
 announced "transformational deal"?  Is the reported cost of EUR100m an accurate
 one, or is the final cost greater than this figure? Please confirm for all
 shareholders that this "transformation" will only reduce Aer Lingus' costs by as
 little as EUR5 per passenger.
2.      We note that a similar team (to
 that in 2006), led by Goldman Sachs, has been appointed by Aer Lingus to defend
 Ryanair's current merger offer. Since Aer Lingus previously spent over EUR24m of
 shareholder funds defending a higher offer (in Oct 2006), can the company
 confirm for all shareholders the amount of the cap, referred to by you before
 the parliamentary committee today, which has been placed on Aer Lingus' defence
 costs this time around.
3.      Can the company confirm for all
 shareholders the current (Dec 2008) deficit in the Aer Lingus defined benefit
 pension schemes?  In light of the recent collapse in Irish pension scheme
 valuations, can the company confirm that its pension schemes are fully funded or
 will a further exceptional cost increase (in the form of pension contribution
 top ups) be required by Aer Lingus Group plc to fund the hole in its pension
 schemes?
4.      Since the company last week announced that it would
 eliminate long haul fuel surcharges with immediate effect, can the  company
 please confirm for all shareholders the impact of this revenue loss on Aer
 Lingus' forecast post exceptional net profit (loss) after tax for 2008 and
 2009.
5.      Since Aer Lingus Group plc has previously forecast an
 operating loss of approx. EUR20m in 2008 (11 Nov interim statement)  and another
 operating loss of approx. EUR70m in 2009 (investor conference call 28th Aug 2008),
 can the company, in light of the above substantial cost increases and revenue
 reductions, please confirm its forecast post exceptional net profit (loss) after
 tax for both 2008 and 2009.
6.      During the course of Aer Lingus'
 most recent investor conference call (28th Aug 2008), the company forecast that
 its net  cash balance would decline to "about EUR550m" by the end of 2009. In
 light of the impact of: (i) the substantial cost increases outlined above,  (ii)
 the loss of revenue arising from the elimination of fuel surcharges, (iii) the
 impact of the company's current fuel hedges, (iv) the compensation cost for the
 recent "transformational deal", and (v) the company's expected defence fees, can
 the company please confirm for all shareholders its revised forecast net cash
 balances at year end 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2009.
7.     Can
 the company please explain to all shareholders the apparent contradiction
 between Aer Lingus' interim statement of just 5 weeks ago (11 Nov 2008) (in
 which Aer Lingus announced capacity reductions on its long haul and short haul
 network) with its recent statements to the media and at today's parliamentary
 committee of a campaign of growth in 2009. Can the company please confirm for
 all shareholders its revised capacity and capex forecast for 2009 and its impact
 on the company's forecast net cash balance of "about EUR550m" by the end of
 2009.
Like all other investors in Aer Lingus Group plc, we would
 appreciate a detailed clarification of the above issues and their impact on
Ryanair Holdings PLC Shareholder Letter to Aer Lingus Chairman
 forecast post exceptional net profit (loss) after tax in 2008 and again in 2009,
 for all shareholders, in your forthcoming defence document. As I'm sure you will
 appreciate, the above issues will be of utmost importance to all stakeholders in
 maximising shareholder value in Aer Lingus Group plc.
Yours sincerely,
______________

Ryanair offer document contains nothing new
The Board of Aer Lingus has already unanimously rejected Ryanair's Offer, which
 significantly undervalues Aer Lingus and would see Ryanair build a monopoly of
 air transportation to and from Ireland. There is nothing new in today's
 document.
Colm Barrington, Chairman of Aer Lingus, said: "This document
Aer Lingus Group PLC Ryanair offer document contains nothing new
 contains nothing new. It is the usual stream of invective, spin and
 misrepresentation that we expect from the people at Ryanair. It also fails to
 address the recent EU prohibition decision which found emphatically that Ryanair
 wants to destroy consumer choice. It is a desperate last effort to create an
 airline monopoly in Ireland, and is clearly not in the interests of Aer Lingus
 shareholders and the travelling public. Aer Lingus is and will continue to be a
 strong independent airline. Ryanair clearly needs Aer Lingus but we do not need
 Ryanair."

 Irish Takeover Panel
 12 December 2008
Irish Takeover Panel Announcement
Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus")
Ryanair Holdings plc ("Ryanair")
On 4 December 2008 Ryanair issued an announcement ("the Announcement") setting
 out certain undertakings in respect of its proposed offer for Aer Lingus. This
 information had been disclosed at a meeting with the Minister for Transport on 3
 December. These undertakings were not set out in Ryanair's Rule 2.5 announcement
 released on 1 December.
The Panel has considered these undertakings (the headings of which are
 reproduced in the attached Appendix) in the context of Rule 16 of the Irish
 Takeover Panel Act, 1997 Takeover Rules, 2007 to 2008 ("Rules") and General
 Principle 1 of the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997, as amended ("Act").
The Panel's statutory function is inter alia to monitor and supervise takeovers
 so as to ensure compliance with the General Principles and the Rules. General
 Principle 1 states inter alia that all holders of the securities of an offeree
 of the same class must be afforded equivalent treatment. Rule 16, which deals
Irish Takeover Panel Panel Announcement
 with special arrangements with favourable terms, states inter alia that except
 with Panel consent, neither an offeror nor any person acting in concert with it
 may during an offer period make any arrangement with any offeree shareholder
 which involves a dealing in, or acceptance of an offer for, or otherwise relates
 to, offeree shares, if there would be attached to such arrangement a term
 favourable to such shareholder or any other person which is not being extended
 under the offer to all offeree shareholders.
The Panel has ruled that the making by Ryanair of arrangements as described in
 paragraphs C, D and E of the Announcement would constitute a breach of Rule 16
 and General Principle 1 as they would constitute arrangements with an Aer Lingus
 shareholder containing favourable terms which were not being extended to all Aer
 Lingus shareholders (the Irish Government through the Minister for Finance holds
 a 25.1% shareholding in Aer Lingus). Consequently, the Panel has given a
 direction pursuant to section 9(2) of the Act to Ryanair prohibiting it from
 extending these undertakings under its proposed offer for Aer Lingus or from
 making arrangements with any shareholder of Aer Lingus in respect of these
 undertakings at any time when Rule 16 and/or General Principle 1 is applicable.
With regard to the undertakings described in paragraphs A and B of the
 Announcement, while it is not clear from the Announcement whether an arrangement
 is contemplated with any Aer Lingus shareholder, the Panel has directed Ryanair
 not to extend these undertakings under its proposed offer for Aer Lingus unless:
(i)     it is clear to whom the commitments are being given;
(ii)     they are in compliance with Rule 16 and General Principle 1;
(iii)    Ryanair and its advisers are satisfied that Rule 19.1 (standards of
 care) is complied
 with; and
(iv)    Ryanair and its advisers have consulted the Panel if there is any doubt

Ryanair Statement on Takeover Panel Ruling
Morgan Stanley & Co. Limited and Davy Corporate Finance, financial advisers to
 Ryanair, note today's Announcement (12 December) by the Irish Takeover Panel in
 relation to certain undertakings by Ryanair in respect of its proposed offer for
 Aer Lingus.
In its announcement of 4 Dec., Ryanair undertook that, if its Offer is
 successful, it will:
A)Continue Aer Lingus' trade union recognition policy
 B)    Restore Shannon-Heathrow connectivity
 C)    Provide the Irish Government and Minister for Transport with a legally
 binding guarantee which will ensure that
Aer Lingus' Heathrow slots
 cannot be sold, transferred, leased or switched by Aer Lingus to any other
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Statement on Takeover Panel Ruling
 airline
or any other route without the prior written approval of
 the Irish Minister for Transport
 D)    Provide a EUR100 million bank guarantee
 that Aer Lingus' short haul fares will be reduced by a minimum of 5%
for a three year period post completion
 E)    Provide an additional EUR100 million bank guarantee that Aer Lingus' fuel
 surcharges will be eliminated in their
entirety (for all new
 bookings) within 28 days of completion of the Offer.
These commitments and bank guarantees were intended to provide all Aer Lingus
 stakeholders including its employees, consumers, and the Irish Government an
 absolute assurance that the undertakings put forward by Ryanair in its 1
 December Offer for Aer Lingus would be delivered upon.
Ryanair met with the Minister of Transport in his capacity as custodian of Irish
 national aviation policy solely to highlight the benefits of this Offer for all
 Aer Lingus stakeholders. Ryanair has held similar meetings with other government
 parties, opposition parties, and consumer groups, to highlight in an identical
 manner, how these benefits will be delivered and guaranteed for all
 stakeholders.
Morgan Stanley & Co. Limited and Davy Corporate Finance, on behalf of
 Ryanair, strongly disagree with the decision of the Takeover Panel.
The effect of today's decision by the Irish Takeover Panel seems to render the
 Minister for Transport as an inappropriate representative of consumer and
 stakeholder interests in Aer Lingus during an offer period, while the Minister
 for Finance remains a shareholder in Aer Lingus. This would appear to prevent
 the Minister for Transport or the Government securing the Heathrow slots or
 Ireland's connectivity (in line with national aviation policy), with any party
 who wishes to merge with or acquire Aer Lingus.
Ryanair remains committed to providing these benefits and guarantees to all Aer
 Lingus stakeholders including employees and consumers, who are the ultimate
 beneficiaries of these commitments and Ryanair intends to proceed with the
 proposed Offer including the delivery of these benefits and guarantees in a form
 consistent with the constraints imposed by the Irish Takeover Panel.
Ryanair welcomed today's ruling by the Takeover Panel to compel Aer Lingus to
 provide Ryanair with a copy of its shareholder register, following the Panel's
 ruling that Aer Lingus had breached the Takeover Rules (Rule 10.2).

Aer Lingus announces removal of fuel surcharges from long haul flights
Dublin, London, 12th December 2008: Aer Lingus announces, with immediate effect,
 the removal of all fuel surcharges on its long haul services booked on flights
 from today (12th December 2008). Since the introduction of fuel surcharges, the
 airline has kept the price of oil under review and has adjusted the surcharge
 level in line with movements in fuel prices. Today's decision has been taken in
 the context of reductions in fuel prices over a sustained period.
Aer Lingus Group PLC Removal of Fuel Surcharge
Dermot Mannion, Aer Lingus Chief Executive, said, "This is very good news for
 Aer Lingus customers. We have been consistent in our approach to the fuel
 surcharge.
 Now that oil prices have fallen and stabilised over the past number of months,
 we believe the right thing to do is to remove these surcharges altogether."
Aer Lingus did not impose a fuel surcharge on its short haul services.

Aer Lingus discusses Ryanair's plans for monopoly with the
 Minister for Transport
Chairman and CEO reiterate Aer Lingus Board's unanimous rejection of
 Ryanair Offer
Aer Lingus announces that its Chairman, Colm Barrington, and Chief Executive,
 Dermot Mannion, met today with the Irish Minister for Transport, Noel Dempsey TD
 to discuss with him Ryanair's announced intention to make an unsolicited offer
Aer Lingus Group PLC Meeting with Minister for Transport
 to shareholders.
They made clear to the Minister that the Board unanimously rejects the offer
 which significantly undervalues Aer Lingus and would see Ryanair establish a
 monopoly on air travel / connectivity to and from Ireland.
The Group's Chairman and CEO pointed out that there are significant shortcomings
 in Ryanair's proposals and that these will be detailed in an Aer Lingus response
 circular to shareholders in due course. The Minister was briefed on the new
 agreements recently concluded with members of SIPTU and Impact, the two largest
 unions in Aer Lingus, which fundamentally change Aer Lingus' staff cost and
 productivity going forward.
In addition, they emphasised Aer Lingus' exceptionally strong financial
 condition which will enable the Group to continue to provide strong, sustainable
 and vigorous competition in the best interests of consumers who fly into and out
 of Ireland. They outlined that this offer is an effort to eliminate competition
 in the Irish market place, which would be a disaster for the government and is
 unacceptable to both consumers and to the EU Commission.
Following the meeting, Chief Executive, Dermot Mannion said:
"We had a productive meeting with the Minister today and have committed to give
 the Government, as well as all other shareholders, a comprehensive rebuttal of
 Ryanair's offer after the publication of its Offer Document.
"Ryanair cannot spin away the fact that Aer Lingus is and will continue to be
 its fiercest competitor into and out of Ireland. It is offering other Aer Lingus
 shareholders a mere EUR525 million, a pathetic sum in the context of the EUR1.3
 billion in cash on the Group's balance sheet, the substantial value of our fleet
 and the value of the Heathrow slots. Aer Lingus remains a strong business with
 significant cash reserves and a robust long-term future. Despite all of
 Ryanair's insincere promises, this Offer, if accepted, would be bad for Irish
 consumers, for Aer Lingus' shareholders and for everyone who works in the
 airline."

Aer Lingus welcomes outcome of IMPACT decision
Airline on track to deliver EUR50 million cost savingsCost restructuring secures Shannon future and growth 
opportunity
Dublin & London, 8 December, 2008: Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus" or "Group"), today welcomed the outcome 
of the IMPACT decision to vote in favour of alternative cost saving measures including work practice changes which 
will deliver the required savings from cabin crew. This announcement, together with a pay freeze in all other areas 
of the company and the outcome of the SIPTU vote last Friday, December 5th 2008, means the Company will 
deliver annualised staff cost savings of EUR50 million.
This decision by IMPACT also secures the future of the company's long haul services for the Shannon region. In 
addition, it allows the company to examine the possibility of new short haul services from Shannon following a 
commitment given to the Shannon Inter-Union Business Review Group on November 28th last. These 
commitments were given in light of Ryanair's threat to reduce services from the airport in Autumn 2009 following the 
introduction of the Irish travel tax in the recent budget.
Commenting on the development, Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion said
"This decision by IMPACT is a milestone development for the airline and will enable us to deliver on our stated 
objectives of securing annual staff cost savings of EUR50 million.
Aer Lingus Group Plc Statement re IMPACT decision
The outcome of the vote today, combined with a significant reduction in the cost of fuel, underpins our ability to 
deliver growth for the future and secures our long haul service into and out of the Shannon region, and allows us to 
look at opportunities for short haul growth from Shannon airport.
Once again, we would like to acknowledge the contribution of our staff throughout this process who have 
succeeded in delivering an alternative solution."
Aer Lingus also acknowledged the role of the Labour Relations Commission during this process.

Aer Lingus confirms SIPTU staff cost savings
Dublin & London, 5 December, 2008: Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus" or
 "Group"), today welcomed the positive outcome of the recent SIPTU ballot which
 delivers significant cost savings, work practice changes and pay inflation
 moderation for the airline. The examination of the options chosen by individual
 staff members indicates at this point that the necessary take ups required in
 each of Dublin, Cork and Shannon will be sufficient to deliver the annualised
 target savings of EUR25 million relevant to the SIPTU areas of the airline.
Speaking today Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion said
Aer Lingus Group PLC Aer Lingus confirms SIPTU staff cost savings
"Crucially, this transformational programme of change will provide an excellent
 platform for growth at each base in the future.
I would like to acknowledge the cooperation, commitment and determination of all
 of the members of our management, staff and their representatives who worked
 collectively to deliver the required level of cost savings as an alternative to
 outsourcing."
Aer Lingus will make further announcements on the progress of its cost reduction
 programme shortly.

For Immediate Release
Not for release, publication or distribution, in whole or in part, in or into or

 jurisdiction where it would be unlawful to do so.
Update on
 Cash Offer by
 Coinside Limited
 a wholly owned subsidiary of
Ryanair Holdings plc
 for
 Aer Lingus Group plc
Since Ryanair's announcement of its Offer, it has noted a range of observations
 and comments from a variety of interested parties and stakeholders. Opinions
 have also been expressed that Ryanair's Offer is unlikely to receive European
 Commission merger approval.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Update on Cash Offer for Aer Lingus
At a meeting between Ryanair and the Minister for Transport last night, 3
 December, 2008, Ryanair highlighted the benefits which the Offer, if successful,
 would deliver to Ireland, Irish consumers, Aer Lingus employees and all other
 Aer Lingus stakeholders.
In this announcement Ryanair outlines some of the details of its proposals in
 order to demonstrate how the Offer promotes and secures competition and how it
 will promote national aviation policy and perceived Irish Government concerns in
 that regard.
With respect to the Offer, Ryanair is undertaking that, if its Offer is
 successful, it will:
A)     Recognise the Trade Unions in Aer Lingus. Ryanair will commit and
 guarantee that Aer Lingus will continue to honour and respect Aer Lingus'
 long-standing policy of trade union recognition within Aer Lingus.
B)     Shannon-Heathrow connectivity will be restored. Ryanair will ensure that
 Aer Lingus returns to the Shannon-Heathrow route with a minimum daily frequency
 of a morning and evening rotation, at the first seasonal schedule change
 following completion of the Offer. The Heathrow slots necessary to meet this
 commitment will be switched from one of Aer Lingus' other Heathrow routes. This
 will meet the Government's national aviation objective of restoring connectivity
 between Heathrow and the Shannon/Midwest region, and improving Ireland's
 connectivity to London Heathrow.
C)     Government will be given control over London Heathrow slots. Ryanair
 propose that the Articles of Association of Aer Lingus will be amended upon
 completion of the Offer to provide the Irish Government and Minister for
 Transport with a legally binding guarantee that will ensure Aer Lingus' Heathrow
 slots cannot be sold, transferred, leased or switched by Aer Lingus to any other
 airline or to any other route without the prior written approval of the Irish
 Minister for Transport. This legally binding guarantee will protect Ireland's
 connectivity to Heathrow and the world.
This will ensure that the Irish Government's national aviation policy (as
 articulated at the time of the Aer Lingus' IPO), to ensure a minimum level of
 connectivity between London Heathrow and Dublin, Cork and Shannon, will be
 guaranteed into the future. This proposed provision in the Aer Lingus articles
 of association (which will be detailed in the Offer Document) will correct the
 deficiencies in Aer Lingus' existing Articles, which allowed Aer Lingus to close
 the Shannon-Heathrow route and replace it with a Belfast-Heathrow route, despite
 the Government's objection. This guarantee' will ensure that Heathrow's
 connectivity to Dublin, Cork and Shannon can be protected by the current and
 future Irish Ministers for Transport for the benefit of Ireland and all Irish
 consumers/visitors.
D)     Ryanair will provide a EUR100 million bank guarantee that Aer Lingus' short
 haul fares will be reduced by a minimum of 5% for a three year period. Ryanair's
 Offer guarantee's to reduce Aer Lingus' short haul fares (EUR94 in 2007) by a
 minimum of 5%, on a like for like basis, for a three year period post
 completion. The merged Ryanair/Aer Lingus Group will provide the Irish
 Government with a EUR100 million bank guarantee which can be drawn down by the
 Irish Government on behalf of consumer/taxpayers if an independent auditor,
 nominated by the Government, cannot confirm that the Ryanair/Aer Lingus Group
Ryanair Holdings PLC Update on Cash Offer for Aer Lingus
 have complied with this fare reduction guarantee each year for the 3 years post
 completion of the Offer. The Ryanair/Aer Lingus Group will also reimburse the
 Government for all costs associated with this annual independent audit of Aer
 Lingus' short haul fare reduction. This EUR100 million bank guarantee will provide
 consumers, the Irish Government and all other stakeholders with absolute
 assurance that the annual EUR40 million consumer savings arising from the minimum
 5% reduction in Aer Lingus' average short haul fare will be delivered, in order
 to promote competition and growth on Aer Lingus' short haul route network.
E)     Ryanair will provide an additional EUR100 million bank guarantee that Aer
 Lingus' fuel surcharges will be eliminated in their entirety (for all new
 bookings) within 28 days of completion of the Offer. The merged Ryanair/Aer
 Lingus Group will provide the Irish Government with a EUR100 million bank
 guarantee which can be drawn down by the Irish Government on behalf of
 consumers/taxpayers if an independent auditor nominated by the Government cannot
 confirm that the Ryanair/Aer Lingus Group have complied with this fuel surcharge
 elimination within 28 days of completion of the Ryanair Offer (for all new
 bookings). The Ryanair/Aer Lingus Group will also reimburse the Government for
 all costs associated with this independent audit of Aer Lingus' fuel surcharge
 elimination. This EUR100 million bank guarantee will provide consumers, the Irish
 Government and all other stakeholders with absolute assurance that the annual
 EUR100 million consumer saving arising from the elimination of Aer Lingus' fuel
 surcharges will be delivered in order to promote competition and growth on the
 Aer Lingus' long haul route network.
Ryanair believes that these substantial guarantees and financial penalties,
 which will be unique to the proposed Ryanair-Aer Lingus airline merger, will
 afford consumers, the Irish Government, the European Commission and all other
 stakeholders the necessary confidence in Ryanair's guarantees. Ryanair believes
 that these reductions in Aer Lingus' short haul fares and removal of Aer Lingus'
 fuel surcharges will deliver annual consumer savings of over EUR140 million, and
 will meet national aviation policy by promoting and securing the competitiveness
 of Aer Lingus' short and long haul network, and increasing competition between
 Aer Lingus' lower fares and Ryanair's services on short haul routes to and from
 Ireland.
Full details of these proposals and the full terms and conditions of the Offer
 will be contained in the Offer Document. The Offer Document will be posted to
 Aer Lingus Shareholders in due course.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
REJECTION BY AER LINGUS OF RYANAIR PROPOSAL
The Board of Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus") has considered the announcement by Ryanair Holdings plc 
("Ryanair") of its intention to make another unsolicited offer for the whole of the issued and to be issued ordinary 
share capital of Aer Lingus not already owned by Ryanair at a price of EUR1.40 per share (the "Offer").
Ryanair's prior offer for Aer Lingus lapsed on 20th December 2006, having failed to achieve antitrust clearance. 
Following a thorough review, the European Commission prohibited Ryanair's takeover of Aer Lingus on 27th June 
2007. Ryanair is now appealing the European Commission prohibition. Consequently, this new lower Offer is not 
capable of completion.
Aer Lingus remains a strong business with significant cash reserves and a robust long term future. The Board 
believes that the Offer significantly undervalues Aer Lingus.
The Board rejects this new Offer and Aer Lingus shareholders are strongly advised to take no action in relation to 
the Offer.

 A wholly owned subsidiary
of
Ryanair Holdings plc
for
Aer Lingus Group plc
1. Introduction
The Board of Ryanair today announces the terms of a Cash Offer for 100 per cent.
 of the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Aer Lingus.
 Ryanair intends to make this offer through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
 Coinside. The Ryanair Group owns approximately 29.82 per cent. of the current
 issued share capital of Aer Lingus and expects to accept the Cash Offer in
 respect of these shares. The making of the Cash Offer is subject to certain
 conditions set out in Appendix I, including amongst other conditions, the
 acceptance by Aer Lingus Shareholders holding not less than 90 per cent. of the
 issued and to be issued share capital of Aer Lingus (or such lower percentage as
 Ryanair may determine, subject always to the Takeover Rules), the passing of the
 Ryanair Shareholder Resolutions at an EGM to be held as soon as reasonably
 practicable to approve the Cash Offer, and Ryanair obtaining EU Commission
 clearance or (as the case may be) Irish and other applicable EU member state
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer -3-
 competition law clearance for the combination of Ryanair and Aer Lingus.
2. The Cash Offer
Coinside will offer to acquire all of the issued and to be issued share capital
 of Aer Lingus, subject to the conditions and on the terms set out in Appendix I
 to this announcement and the full terms and conditions which well be set out in
 the Offer Document and the related Form of Acceptance, on the following basis:
EUR1.40 in cash for every Aer Lingus Share
The Cash Offer values the entire issued ordinary share capital of Aer Lingus at
 approximately EUR748 million. Key features of the Offer are:
*  It is an all cash offer
*  It represents a premium of approximately 28 per cent. over the average Closing
 Price (EUR1.09) of an Aer Lingus share for the 30 Business Days to 28 November
 2008 (being the last Business Day prior to the date of this announcement)
*  It represents a premium of approximately 25 per cent. over the Closing Price
 (EUR1.12) of an Aer Lingus Share on 28 November 2008
The Board of Ryanair believes that the Cash Offer represents very attractive and
 certain value to Aer Lingus Shareholders. If they accept the Cash Offer and the
 Offer is successful, the Irish Government will realise, with certainty, a
 further EUR188 million from the sale of its Aer Lingus Shares (in addition to the
 approximately EUR160 million realised in September 2006 at the time of the Aer
 Lingus Initial Public Offering). This is clearly beneficial in the context of
 the current recessionary environment and will make a valuable contribution
 towards budget spending in such important areas as health and education. In
 addition, the Aer Lingus ESOT and Aer Lingus employees (including through a
 combination of their Tailwind investment vehicle and Irish Airline Pilots
 Pensions Limited holdings) will realise, with certainty, over EUR137 million if
 they accept the Offer and the Offer is successful. Ryanair believes that this
 Cash Offer is generous in the context of:
*  The collapse in Aer Lingus' share price from a high of over EUR3.00 in December
 2006 to less than EUR1.00 in November 2008
 *  Aer Lingus' load factors which have declined by over 7% (long haul) and almost
 2% (short haul) in 2008
 *  Aer Lingus' forecast operating losses for 2008 and again in 2009
 *  The current airline industry crisis amid the deepening economic recession
 *  Declining equity prices
In addition the merger will establish for Ireland one of Europe's "Big Four"
 airline groups which will be financially strong, and Irish managed and
 headquartered; a key objective of all stakeholders. This new airline group will
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer -3-
 have the cleanest, most fuel efficient fleet of Europe's Big Four airline
 groups.
In contrast, the Board of Ryanair believes that the shareholders and other
 stakeholders in Aer Lingus face significant uncertainty with regard to the
 future operating, financial and share price performance of Aer Lingus as an
 independent airline. The airline sector is under unprecedented pressure from the
 deepening economic recession and high oil prices. Over 30 carriers have failed
 in the year 2008 to date (including XL Airways UK, Futura, LTE and Sterling
 Airways). An isolated, uncompetitive, loss-making EU flag carrier like Aer
 Lingus, overly-dependent on a deteriorating Irish economy is, we believe,
 significantly more exposed to the global recession. In addition, we believe that
 Aer Lingus has few realistic third-party alternatives. The Board of Ryanair
 believes that a sale of Aer Lingus to one of the three other large mega-carriers
 that are consolidating the EU airline industry (Air France, British Airways and
 Lufthansa) represents a very unattractive outcome for all of Aer Lingus'
 stakeholders (potentially resulting in higher fares and fuel surcharges, a loss
 of Aer Lingus' Heathrow slots, a reduced route network, and Aer Lingus being
 headquartered and controlled from outside Ireland).
Compounding the malaise in the industry, it is the opinion of the Board of
 Ryanair that Aer Lingus' management have failed to deliver on the justifications
 for remaining an independent company put forward in 2006:
û"Track record of superior returns justifies premium rating":
 -The Board of Aer Lingus labelled Ryanair's previous offer of EUR2.80 per share as
 "derisory" yet they have presided over a share price that has declined from over
 EUR3.00 in December 2006 to under EUR1.00 in November 2008, resulting in a EUR960m
 loss in value
 -Aer Lingus spent over EUR24 million on its defence of Ryanair's 2006 offer
 -Aer Lingus has allowed its director's basic annual fee to almost treble from
 EUR17,500 to EUR45,000
 -Aer Lingus has increased its non-executive Chairman's basic annual fee fivefold
 from EUR35,000 to EUR175,000
 -In its interim management statement, released 11th November, 2008, Aer Lingus
 confirmed that it forecasts to make operating losses in both 2008 and again in
 2009
 -Aer Lingus' most recent attempts to make its operating cost base competitive
 (through the out-sourcing of 1,300 staff) have resulted in further threats of
 industrial action
 -Aer Lingus has hedged the vast majority of its fuel costs in the remainder of
 2008 and the majority of its fuel costs in 2009 at levels very significantly
 above current spot and future levels
 -Aer Lingus ordered new A330 aircraft in 2007 (at the top of the cycle), but
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer -3-
 then deferred an A330 delivery in November 2008
û "Excellent prospects as an independent company":
 -EU-wide consolidation is accelerating and unsustainable stand alone EU flag
 carriers are consolidating under Air France/KLM, British Airways, and Lufthansa
 -As confirmed in its interim management statement, released 11th November, 2008,
 Aer Lingus is significantly reducing both long haul and short haul capacity and
 deferring aircraft delivery. Growth since Ryanair's previous offer has been
 loss-making
 -In December 2007, Aer Lingus closed its Shannon base and replaced it with a new
 Belfast base which is performing poorly
 -Aer Lingus' short haul fares continue to be uncompetitive versus Ryanair's and
 other low cost airlines such as easyjet
 -Aer Lingus' cost base is still not competitive by comparison with low cost
 airlines such as Ryanair and easyjet, and Ryanair believes that Aer Lingus'
 current restructuring plans will make no appreciable difference to this cost
 disadvantage
 -Aer Lingus continues to trail Ryanair and other airlines in punctuality and
 consistently does not publish its lost baggage and flight cancellation
 statistics
 -Ryanair believes Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges and load factors continue to
 damage its long haul competitiveness as evidenced by its 17 consecutive months
 of long haul load factor declines to end October 2008
 -Aer Lingus has suffered short haul load factor declines in 9 out of the 12
 months to end October 2008
 -It is not possible to reconcile forecast operating losses in 2008 and again
 2009 with "excellent prospects as an independent company"
ûA combination of Ryanair and Aer Lingus is " ill-conceived":
 -The Ryanair proposal to merge the two airlines will result in one strong Irish
 airline group under common ownership but with both airlines operating
 separately, with separate distinctive brands, thereby preserving the best
 features of both, including Ryanair's low fares, high punctuality operations,
 and Aer Lingus' special brand, service culture and long haul operations
 -The Board of Ryanair believes that the only way to secure the long-term future
 of Aer Lingus as a financially secure, Irish managed, regulated and
 headquartered airline is through this proposal
 -The rationale for one strong airline group for Ireland and European consumers
 is more compelling than ever given the rapid acceleration of EU-wide
 consolidation in the industry
The Offer will extend to all Aer Lingus Shares unconditionally issued on the
 date of the Offer, together with any further such shares which are
 unconditionally issued while the Offer remains open for acceptance or until such
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer -3-
 earlier date as, subject to the Takeover Rules, Ryanair may determine.
The Aer Lingus Shares are to be acquired fully paid or credited as fully paid
 and free from all liens, charges, equitable interests and encumbrances, rights
 of pre-emption and any other rights or interests of any nature whatsoever and
 together with all rights now and hereafter attaching thereto including voting
 rights and the right to receive and retain all dividends and other distributions
 (if any) declared, made or paid thereafter.
The Offer shall be made by Coinside, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ryanair.

 waived), Coinside intends to exercise its rights pursuant to the provisions of

 and to propose a resolution to re-register Aer Lingus as a private company under
 the relevant provisions of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983. If this

 and marketability of any Aer Lingus Shares not assented to the Cash Offer. It is
 anticipated that the cancellations will take effect no earlier than 20 Business
 Days from either the date Coinside has acquired 75% of the voting rights in Aer
 Lingus or on the first date of issue of compulsory acquisition notices by
 Coinside pursuant to Regulation 23 of the Takeover Regulations.

 EUR140m p.a. and repeated restructurings have led to pay cuts and job losses with
 no substantial benefit as operating costs per passenger have risen by 18% in
 just 2 years. Aer Lingus is now suffering load factor declines, and has recently
 announced capacity reductions and forecast operating losses in 2008 and again in
 2009.
Ryanair's merger proposal today offers Ireland a better future by:-
- delivering over EUR325m in cash to the Irish government, the ESOT and Aer Lingus
 employees
 - guaranteeing that Aer Lingus will remain a separate company with a special
 brand
 - securing Heathrow slots and their connectivity for Ireland at lower fares
 - doubling of Aer Lingus' short haul fleet to 66 aircraft within 5 years,
 creating over 1000 associated new jobs in Aer Lingus
 - cutting Aer Lingus' short haul fares by 5% for 3 years, saving consumers over
 EUR40m annually
 - removing Aer Lingus' long haul fuel surcharges, saving consumers over EUR100m
 annually
 - creating an Irish national champion in the airline sector with a growing
 pan-European and transatlantic network
 - assuring Aer Lingus' future in one of the EU's Big Four airline groups (Air
 France/KLM, British Airways Group, Lufthansa/Swiss & Aer Lingus/Ryanair)
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer -2-
We have today requested early meetings with the Irish Ministers for Finance and
 Transport, the Board of Aer Lingus, and Aer Lingus's ESOT trustees to highlight
 the benefits for Ireland and all other stakeholders of this comprehensive and
 valuable merger proposal."

 objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions expressed in such forward
 looking statements made by  Ryanair or Aer Lingus or on their behalf include,
 but are not limited to, general economic conditions in Ireland, the United

 for
 Aer Lingus Group plc
RYANAIR ANNOUNCES MERGER PROPOSAL WITH AER LINGUS, BY OFFERING EUR1.40 PER AER
 LINGUS SHARE WHICH WILL LEAD TO ONE STRONG IRISH AIRLINE GROUP, LOWER FARES FOR
 CONSUMERS, RAPID FLEET GROWTH AND 1,000 NEW JOBS IN AER LINGUS. OFFER WORTH OVER
 EUR325M IN CASH TO IRISH GOVERNMENT AND ESOT/ AER LINGUS EMPLOYEES.
Summary
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer for Aer Lingus Group
The Board of Ryanair today announces its intention to make a Cash Offer of EUR1.40
 per Aer Lingus Share for 100 per cent. of the issued and to be issued share
 capital of Aer Lingus. Ryanair intends to make this offer through its
 wholly-owned subsidiary, Coinside.  Ryanair already owns approximately 29.82 per
 cent. of the current issued share capital of Aer Lingus and expects to accept
 the Cash Offer in respect of these shares.
The Board of Ryanair proposes to merge the two airlines into one strong Irish
 airline group under common ownership. Similar to previous European airline
 mergers such as Air France/KLM and Lufthansa/Swiss, both airlines will operate
 as separate companies, with distinctive brands, thereby preserving the best
 features of both, including Ryanair's low fare, high punctuality operations, and
 Aer Lingus' special brand, service culture as well as its long haul operations.
Benefits for Aer Lingus Shareholders
The Offer values the entire issued ordinary share capital of Aer Lingus at
 approximately EUR748 million. Key features of the Offer are:
*  This is an all cash offer
*  It represents a premium of approximately 28 per cent. over the average Closing
 Price (EUR1.09) of an Aer Lingus share for the 30 days to 28 November 2008 (being
 the last Business Day prior to the date of this announcement)
*  It represents a premium of approximately 25 per cent. over the Closing Price
 (EUR1.12) of an Aer Lingus Share on 28 November 2008
Benefits for Aer Lingus and its Employees
Ryanair has requested an early meeting with the Chairman and Board
 representatives of Aer Lingus, as well as the ESOT trustees, to explain the
 benefits Ryanair believes will flow to the Aer Lingus business and its employees
 from this proposed merger, including:
*  The Aer Lingus ESOT and employee shareholders will receive over EUR137 million in
 cash if the Offer is successful
 *  A commitment to double the size of the Aer Lingus short haul fleet, from 33 to
 66 aircraft over the next 5 years, thereby creating 1,000 new jobs in Aer Lingus
 during that period
 *  Better promotion prospects for Aer Lingus employees through this rapid growth
 *  Improved job security as part of one strong Irish airline group
 *  Aer Lingus employees will join one of Europe's Big Four airline groups (Air
 France/KLM, Lufthansa/Swiss, British Airways Group and Aer Lingus/Ryanair)
 *  Aer Lingus employees join an Irish national champion with pan-European network
 *  Aer Lingus to remain a separate company and retain its special brand like KLM
 and Swiss precedents
 *  The Aer Lingus Chairman will be invited to join the Board of Ryanair
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer for Aer Lingus Group
Benefits for Irish Government and Consumers
Ryanair has requested early meetings with the Minister for Finance and the
 Minister for Transport to highlight the benefits Ryanair believes will flow from
 this merger for the Irish Government and consumers including:
*  Ireland will establish one of Europe's "Big Four" airlines which will be
 financially strong, as well as managed and headquartered in Dublin
 *  Securing Aer Lingus' special brand, Heathrow slots and connectivity for Ireland
 *  Doubling Aer Lingus' short haul fleet to 66 aircraft and creating 1,000
 associated new jobs in Aer Lingus over a 5 year period
 *  Irish Government will receive over EUR188 million in cash if the Offer is
 successful, which will make a valuable contribution towards current budget
 spending in areas such as health and education
 *  Ryanair's commitment to growth and lower fares will help the government combat
 recent declines in Irish traffic and tourism
 *  Merged Irish group will have the cleanest, most fuel efficient fleet of Europe's
 Big Four airline groups
 *  Ryanair's commitment to cut Aer Lingus' average short haul fares (EUR94 in 2007)
 by 5% for 3 years, generating an approx EUR40 million p.a. saving for consumers
 *  Ryanair's commitment to eliminate Aer Lingus' long haul fuel surcharges on
 completion, generating an approx EUR100 million p.a. saving for consumers
 *  Improve Aer Lingus' on-time performance to Ryanair's levels
 *  Ryanair secures the Cork and Dublin slots at Heathrow, as well as Heathrow
 connectivity at lower fares for Ireland
 *  Ryanair will upgrade and develop Aer Lingus' long haul product and service
Ryanair believes this Cash Offer provides attractive and certain value for Aer
 Lingus shareholders. Ryanair believes the Cash Offer is generous in the context
 of:
*  The collapse in Aer Lingus' share price from a high of over EUR3.00 in December
 2006 to less than EUR1.00 in November 2008
 *  Aer Lingus' load factors which have declined by over 7% (long haul) and almost
 2% (short haul) in 2008
 *  Aer Lingus' forecast operating losses for 2008 and again in 2009
 *  The current airline industry crisis amid the deepening economic recession
 *  Declining equity prices
In the opinion of the Board of Ryanair, Aer Lingus' management have failed to
 deliver on the reasons they articulated in their 2006 defence documents for
 remaining an independent airline. Since 2006, when Aer Lingus rejected Ryanair's
 EUR2.80 offer, they have:
*  Spent over EUR24 million on its defence of Ryanair's 2006 EUR2.80 offer
 *  Allowed its director's basic annual fee to almost treble from EUR17,500 to EUR45,000
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer for Aer Lingus Group
 *  Allowed its non-executive Chairman's basic annual fee to increase fivefold from
 EUR35,000 to EUR175,000
 *  Increased short haul fares by 7% to EUR94
 *  Increased fuel surcharges 5 times to a current average of EUR75 per sector
 *  Suffered repeated strike threats in April 2006, February, August and November
 2007, February and November 2008
 *  Closed its Shannon base in December 2007
 *  Opened a Belfast base in December 2007 which is performing poorly
 *  Ordered new A330 aircraft in 2007 (at the top of the cycle), but then deferred
 an A330 delivery in November 2008
 *  Suffered short haul and long haul load factor declines in 2008
 *  Forecast operating losses of EUR20 million in 2008 and another operating loss for
 2009
Ryanair believes that Aer Lingus is an isolated, uncompetitive, loss making EU
 flag carrier which has been bypassed by accelerating EU wide airline
 consolidation. Ryanair believes that Aer Lingus needs to find a strong airline
 partner to secure its future. Over the past two years, the trading environment
 for all European airlines has deteriorated dramatically as a result of high oil
 prices and the global recession. This has triggered a wave of EU airline
 closures and failures (in all, over 30 airlines have failed this year). In
 response, pan-European airline consolidation has accelerated as Europe sees the
 emergence of three large mega-carriers, Air France, British Airways and
 Lufthansa, and the rapid growth of Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline.
 So far this year, the following consolidations have been either announced,
 proposed or are being considered:
*  Easyjet - GB Airways
 *  ClickAir - Vueling - Iberia
 *  Alitalia - Air One
 *  Lufthansa - SN Brussels
 *  Air France/KLM - VLM
 *  Air France/KLM - Martinair (proposed)
 *  Lufthansa - BMI (proposed)
 *  Lufthansa - Austrian (proposed)
 *  British Airways - Iberia (being considered)
 *  Air France/KLM or Lufthansa - Alitalia/AirOne (being considered)
Ryanair believes that today's Offer provides a financially robust partner, in
 one strong Irish airline group, within which Aer Lingus will retain its separate
 brand as well as secure the Heathrow slots and connectivity for Ireland at lower
 fares.
The Cash Offer, which will be made by Coinside, a wholly owned subsidiary of
 Ryanair, will be subject to certain conditions set out in Appendix I, including,
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer for Aer Lingus Group
 amongst other conditions, the acceptance by Aer Lingus Shareholders holding not
 less than 90 per cent. of the issued and to be issued share capital of Aer
 Lingus (or such lower percentage as Ryanair may determine, subject always to the
 Takeover Rules), the passing of the Ryanair Shareholder Resolutions at an EGM to
 be held as soon as reasonably practicable to approve the Cash Offer, and Ryanair
 obtaining EU Commission clearance or (as the case may be) Irish and other
 applicable EU member state competition law clearance for the combination of
 Ryanair and Aer Lingus.
Commenting on the Offer, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"This proposed merger of Ryanair and Aer Lingus will form one Irish airline
 group with the financial strength to compete with Europe's 3 major airline
 groups - Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa.
The world has changed dramatically over the past two years, as high oil prices
 and deep recession have caused a flood of airline bankruptcies, consolidations
 and capacity cutbacks. Aer Lingus, as a small, stand alone, regional airline has
 been marginalised and bypassed as most other EU flag carriers consolidate.
Over the past 2 years, the management of Aer Lingus have failed its
 shareholders, customers and staff. Its shares have fallen from over EUR3, to less
 than EUR1 recently. Fares and fuel surcharge increases have cost consumers over

 services to and from Ireland. Aer Lingus operates a single economy class service

 period ended 30 June 2008. Gross assets of Aer Lingus at 30 June 2008 were
 EUR2,159,453,000.

Coinside is a wholly owned non-operating subsidiary of Ryanair. Coinside has not
 traded except for entering into transactions relating to Aer Lingus Shares.
Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley are acting as financial advisers to
 Ryanair and Coinside.
5. Reasons for the Offer and Ryanair's Strategy for Aer Lingus
The Board of Ryanair proposes to merge the two airlines into one strong Irish
 airline group under common ownership. Similar to previous European airline
 mergers such as Air France/KLM and Lufthansa/Swiss, both airlines will operate
 separately, with separate distinctive brands, thereby preserving the best
 features of both, including Ryanair's low fare, high punctuality operations, and
 Aer Lingus' special brand, service culture, and long haul operations. The
 Chairman of Aer Lingus will be invited to join the Board of Ryanair.
Ryanair believes that Aer Lingus is an isolated, uncompetitive, loss making EU
 flag carrier which has been bypassed by ongoing EU wide airline consolidation,
 and needs to find a strong airline partner to secure its future. Over the past
 two years, the trading environment and competitive landscape for all European
 airlines has deteriorated dramatically with high oil prices and the global
 recession. This has triggered a wave of airline closures and failures (in all,
 over 30 airlines have failed this year). In response, EU airline consolidation
 has accelerated as Europe sees the emergence of three large mega-carriers, Air
 France, British Airways and Lufthansa, and the rapid growth of Ryanair, Europe's
 largest low fares airline.
Ryanair believes that the harsh economic downturn, coupled with accelerating
 industry consolidation, leave Aer Lingus exposed to the risk that, as a small,
 isolated, uncompetitive and loss making airline, it will be unable to survive as
 a viable independent operator. Ryanair believes that today's Offer for Aer
 Lingus provides a financially strong partner, in one strong Irish airline group,
 within which Aer Lingus can continue to retain its special brand while improving
 its competitive base by lowering fares, eliminating fuel surcharges and reducing
 costs.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer -4-
Against this background, Ryanair looks forward to receiving EU Commission
 clearance for this pro-consumer combination. European governments and the EU
 Commission have faced up to economic realities in endorsing consolidation over
 competition in both the airline and banking sectors and Ryanair hopes that a
 similar level of realism will be adopted in this scenario.
The Board of Ryanair believes that there are significant consumer benefits of
 combining these two Irish and European airlines for the stakeholders and
 customers of Aer Lingus and makes the following commitments:
üTo cut Aer Lingus' average short haul fares (approximately EUR94 in 2007) by 5%
 for 3 years (generating an approx EUR40 million annual saving for consumers)
 üTo eliminate Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges on completion (generating an approx
 EUR100 million annual saving for consumers)
 üTo retain the Aer Lingus brand, guarantee the Cork and Dublin slots at Heathrow
 and secure Heathrow connectivity for Ireland at lower fares
 üTo double the size of Aer Lingus' short haul fleet (from 33 to 66 aircraft)
 creating a minimum of 1,000 associated new jobs over the next 5 years following
 the successful completion of the Offer
 üTo run Aer Lingus as a separate company under common ownership with Ryanair
 (like Air France/KLM and Lufthansa/Swiss) but competing on the routes where it
 overlaps with Ryanair
As an island nation with an economy in recession, it is critical that Ireland
 continues to benefit from strong and secure low fare airline services in order
 to sustain and support tourism and economic growth. Ryanair believes that the
 Offer may help to combat recent Irish traffic and tourism declines.
As outlined above, the Board of Ryanair envisages that the two companies would
 be run as separate subsidiaries of Ryanair Holdings plc so that nothing in this
 transaction will deflect Ryanair Limited from continuing to relentlessly focus
 on its own pan-European expansion, navigating the current industry downturn by
 lowering costs and thereby, Ryanair believes, doubling traffic and profits by
 2012. In addition, Ryanair shareholders will benefit as there will be
 opportunities (through the combination of Ryanair's and Aer Lingus' combined
 purchasing power and marketing skills) to further reduce operating costs and
 increase efficiencies.
6. Financing
The Offer will be financed from the cash reserves of Ryanair.
Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley confirm they are satisfied that
 resources are available to Ryanair sufficient to satisfy full acceptance of the
 Offer.
7. Employees
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer -4-
Following the Cash Offer becoming or being declared unconditional in all
 respects, the existing employment rights of the management and employees of the
 Aer Lingus Group will be safeguarded in accordance with statutory requirements.
8. Ryanair Shareholder Approval
In view of the size of Aer Lingus relative to Ryanair, amongst other conditions
 to the Cash Offer (as set out in Appendix I), the approval of Ryanair
 shareholders at an EGM is required in accordance with the Listing Rules of the
 Irish Stock Exchange and the UK Listing Authority. An ordinary resolution of
 Ryanair shareholders will be proposed to approve, implement and effect the Offer
 by Ryanair and to authorise the directors of Ryanair to do all such things as
 they consider necessary or appropriate in connection with the Offer.
9. Offer Document
The Offer Document, containing the full terms and conditions of the Offer, will
 be posted as soon as practicable to Aer Lingus Shareholders.
10. Disclosure of Interests in Aer Lingus

 day prior to the date of this announcement, Ryanair owned 159,231,025 Aer Lingus

 RYANAIR CONFIRMS INCREASED AIR PASSENGER DUTY Will Devastate UK TOURISM
 Ryanair today (Tuesday,  25th November 2008) condemned the UK Government's
 increase in air passenger duty (APD) for short haul traffic from GBP10 to GBP11
 in 2009 and GBP12 in 2010 as regressive, damaging to the UK tourism industry
 (when visitor numbers are already falling) and devastating for regional airports
 where passengers and visitors demand low fares and are most price sensitive.
Ryanair blasted the tax which had been billed as an environmental tax since it
 was introduced confirming that not one penny of the tax has done anything to
 address environmental issues.  Ryanair pointed out that the tax fails to reward
 airlines, such as Ryanair, which invest in brand new aircraft and operate
 younger, cleaner, more environmentally friendly aircraft.
Ryanair confirmed that it will now enter into discussions with regional airports
 about the future viability of passenger traffic and growth in light of this
 increased cost.  Ryanair highlighted that its average fare during the winter at
 regional airports is just GBP10 with Ryanair absorbing the current GBP10 tax.
 However Ryanair warned that it will be unable to continue to absorb taxes which
 continue to increase the cost of air travel.
Ryanair released 1 million GBP10 seats for travel in December, January and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Increased APD Will Devastate UK Tourism
 February to highlight that the need to keep average fares low during the winter
 months and to underline the damage this tax will have to UK regional airports
 where passengers are most price sensitive.  Ryanair encouraged passengers to log
 on to www.ryanair.com before midnight Sunday to secure one of these GBP10 seats
 while they still can.
Calling today for an urgent rethink on increasing airport passenger duty,
 Ryanair's Michael Cawley said:
"This Government must realise that it can't tax the tourism industry out of a
 recession.  BAA traffic figures show that passenger traffic has fallen since
 this tax was introduced and this increase will have a further damaging effect on
 passengers.  BAA traffic fell by 5% in September and 6% in October with the
 first 10 months of the year showing a decline of 2%.  As Ryanair has repeatedly
 shown, the tourism industry can only grow and thrive if it has lower access
 costs and not idiotic regressive taxation which hits the poorest, most price
 sensitive passengers, and makes UK tourism an increasingly unattractive option.
 "Our greatest concern is the devastation this regressive tax will have on our
 regional bases, which we have grown due to Ryanair's commitment to lowering
 fares.  The Government is insane if it thinks these price sensitive passengers
 will continue to travel if faced with increased costs.  We have released
 1million GBP10 fares to demonstrate the need for airfares, airport charges and
 so called environmental taxes to be kept low in order to keep passengers
 travelling - especially during the winter and the current recession.  I urge
 passengers to log on to www.ryanair.com before midnight Sunday (30th Nov) to
 secure one of these GBP10 seats".

 BORD FAILTE STATISTICS CONFIRM TRAFFIC FALLS AT IRISH AIRPORTS
Ryanair today (Thursday, 20th November 2008) drew attention to the Bord Failte
 release of passenger statistics to/from the Republic of Ireland for the month of
 October 2008, which shows a continuing decline in air and ferry traffic to/from
 Ireland, with total air traffic down 1%, compared to October 2007, whilst total
 ferry traffic has collapsed by 15%, compared to October 2007.
Ryanair said that these traffic declines, which first became evident in
 September, will increase significantly this Winter, as more flights and services
 are cut from Dublin Airport, in response to the DAA's high and increasing
 monopoly airport charges. Ferry passengers, which account for less than 10% of
 the overall market, are now in freefall, collapsing by 15% on the same month
 last year. Air traffic which has begun to decline for the first time in 15
 years, will see an accelerated rate of decline this Winter as a result of the
 DAA's high and unjustified airport charges, and a further precipitous decline in
 2009 when the Government launches its crazy tourist tax under which visitors to
 Ireland will be charged a EUR10 tax for the privilege of leaving the island.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Bord Failte Confirm Traffic Fall at Irish Airports
"These are the first traffic declines that Ireland has seen for over 15 years.
 The era of low fare traffic and tourism growth is now over, and this decline
 will turn into a collapse this Winter, as traffic and tourism is turned off
 visiting Ireland by the DAA's high airport charges and the Government's crazy
 tourism tax. The only way to develop and grow our tourism business is to lower
 costs and no taxes and yet the Irish Government is doing exactly the opposite
 through its DAA airport monopoly and its crazy tourist tax. Only two other
 countries in Europe (the UK and Holland) have previously introduced this air
 passenger tax. Both have suffered sudden and steep declines in air passenger
 numbers, and it is inevitable that Ireland will suffer a similar fate in 2009.
 The Government cannot grow travel or tourism by taxing it. This didn't work in
 the 1970's and 1980's and it won't work in 2009 either.
"We applaud the Belgian Government, who had proposed a similar visitor tax in
 Belgium, but has since had the good sense in this recession to abandon these
 plans to tax tourists and visitors. We call on the Irish Government to do
 likewise before the traffic declines which have already emerged in recent months
 turn into a collapse this Winter and next Spring on the back of higher
 Government airport monopoly charges, and this crazy tourist tax which will make
 Ireland less competitive for potential visitors and will devastate traffic and
 tourism on and off the island of Ireland in 2009".

Competition Commission Report Confirms Need to Break-up BAA Monopoly
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares carrier, today (4th Nov) warned that the
 Competition Commission's (CC) report on the Price Review for Stansted underlines
 the urgent need for Stansted airport to be sold by the BAA monopoly which
 currently controls London's main airports.  The price increases identified in
 the CC's report further reward the BAA monopoly and will further
 reduce passenger numbers at Stansted Airport.
Speaking today, Jim Callaghan, Ryanair, said:
"The Competition Commission is hamstrung by the current failed regulatory system
 which has allowed the BAA monopoly to build up huge amounts of unnecessary
 capital expenditure over the years. This Taj Mahal approach to expenditure
 rewards the airport monopoly with higher charges to the travelling public.
The CC had recommended the sale of two London airports in its earlier report
 noting that BAA's joint ownership of the three main London airports and the
 flawed regulatory system were having a highly negative effect on competition.
 It is now clear that BAA needs to be forced to immediately sell off Stansted
Ryanair Holdings PLC C.C. Report Confirms Need to Break-up BAA Monopoly
 airport in order to allow the market to introduce lower prices and better
 services for consumers.
Ryanair will continue to work with the CC to ensure that Stansted is sold off as
 soon as possible."

Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said:
"Achieving a half year net profit of EUR215m in very difficult trading conditions
 with record oil prices is a testimony to the strength of the Ryanair lowest fare
 model, which delivered 19% traffic growth, and a 4% yield decline (due to the
 absence of Easter and falling baggage penetration rates). Ancillary revenues
 which grew by 28% to EUR322m account for almost 18% of revenues versus 16% last
 year. Unit costs including fuel rose by 21%. Fuel accounted for more than 50% of
 our total operating costs as the cost per barrel doubled from $63 to $125.
"Spot fuel prices have fallen recently to $60 pbl as the worldwide recession has
 led to a collapse in consumer confidence and consumption. Our fuel hedging
 position remains unchanged for fiscal 2008/09. We are 80% hedged for Q3 at $124
 pbl and totally unhedged in Q4. In recent months a significant disconnect has
 emerged between spot and forward oil prices resulting in fiscal Q1 and Q2
 pricing at a premium of $17 pbl over spot rates. In addition the hedging markets
 are illiquid which partly explains these high premiums. We have taken advantage
 of these recent falls in oil prices to hedge 25% of Q1 and Q2 fiscal 2009/10
 supply at an average of $77 pbl. This will lock in a substantial saving over the
 $125 pbl paid in the half year to September 2008. We continue to closely monitor
 fuel prices and look for opportunities to extend our hedges at these much lower
 oil prices.
"High oil prices and the global recession has, (as we predicted), caused a
 string of airline bankruptcies and/or consolidations in Europe. Recent failures
 include Alitalia, Excel Airways, Futura, LTE, Sterling and Zoom. Many more loss
 making European airlines will go bust this winter because of unsustainable
 losses and insufficient cash reserves. Airline consolidation will continue as
 flag carriers merge into 3 high fare, fuel surcharging groups, led by Air
 France, BA, and Lufthansa. Ryanair will continue to compete with these high fare
 mega carriers most of whom stubbornly refuse to reduce their fuel surcharges to
 reflect the recent 50% fall in oil prices.
"Our new bases at Birmingham, Bologna, Bournemouth, Edinburgh and Reus performed
 well as consumers flock to Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares and no fuel
 surcharges. We have announced 3 new Italian bases for March'09 at Alghero and
 Cagliari in Sardinia and Trapani in Sicily to capitalise on Alitalia's cutbacks
 as more airports realise that only Ryanair can deliver rapid sustainable traffic
 growth. Advance bookings this winter are slightly ahead of target although this
 is due to repeated price promotions resulting in lower than expected fares.
"The Irish government recently announced plans to introduce a EUR10 air travel tax
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results
 which will discriminate against air transport as it is not applied to competing
 trains or ferries. We have called on the Irish government to replace this
 regressive flat rate tax with a fairer and more progressive percentage tax of
 the fare paid. This flat rate tax is grossly inequitable. Why should rich
 (business) passengers on EUR3,000 transatlantic airfares only pay the same EUR10 tax
 as price sensitive shorthaul passengers who (on many Ryanair flights) pay an
 airfare of less than EUR10. This flat rate travel tax has already failed in the UK
 and Holland where traffic at many airports is in steep decline. It is inevitable
 that Irish traffic/tourism will suffer a similar decline next year. While this
 tax will seriously damage our investment in Aer Lingus (who are almost entirely
 exposed to Irish originating traffic and whose load factors are steadily
 declining), its impact on Ryanair will be minor since just 15% of our traffic
 originates in Ireland. However, our base at Shannon (where average airfares are
 less than EUR10 all winter long) will be particularly hard hit and we expect to
 reduce flights and traffic by up to 75% from November 2009 if this penal flat
 rate tax is implemented as announced.
"In the UK we continue to call for the removal of Mr Harry Bush, the hopeless
 CAA regulator, as well as the sale of Stansted by the BAA monopoly. Mr Bush has
 rubber stamped almost all of the BAA's cost increases and capex proposals
 including their crazy plan to waste GBP4bn on Terminal 2 despite the unanimous
 opposition of all Stansted airline users to this gold plated Taj Mahal. He has
 stood idly by while airlines and passengers suffered lengthy security and
 passport queues, repeated baggage belt failures and a doubling of passenger
 charges over the past 18 months. The result of this regulatory failure has been
 the first decline in Stansted traffic over the last 20 years. The proposed sale
 of Gatwick is just the latest ruse by the BAA monopoly to avoid the Competition
 Commission's break-up recommendations. We believe the UK government and the
 Competition Authority must force the BAA to bring forward the early sale of
 Stansted and at least one of the Scottish airports. This will lead to real
 competition and better passenger service. It will also ensure that efficient
 facilities are built at Stansted which will meet the needs of airlines and
 consumers rather than inflate the costs and profits of the BAA monopoly.
"We have implemented our plans to ground 15 Stansted aircraft and 4 Dublin
 aircraft this winter following further unjustified increases in the already high
 passenger charges at these airports. Despite these reductions, we expect
 Ryanair's traffic will still grow by 9% this winter, and by 14% to 58m for the
 full year. The economic recession has caused consumer confidence to collapse.
 Ryanair's fares are now even more attractive as consumers become more price
 sensitive and trade down from high fare, fuel surcharging airlines, like Air
 France, BA and Lufthansa. As more airlines go bust, and the wave of European
 consolidation continues, the strongest survivors will be those airlines -like
 Ryanair- who are well financed, have a strong balance sheet, and the lowest cost

 base.
"The outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year (2008/09) is dependant upon
 fares and fuel prices. The recession will continue to drive down oil prices and
 fares this winter. We will continue to respond with lower fares and aggressive
 price promotions to keep Europe flying and to maintain our market leading load
 factors. Although we have limited visibility, we now believe that average fares
 in the second half will fall by between -15% to -20% leading to losses in the
 3rd and 4th quarters. Our full year average fare could fall by almost -12%
 although these lower fares will be largely offset by lower fuel costs (currently
 $73 pbl in Q4). As a result our previous guidance remains unchanged and we
 remain confident that we will break even for the full year.
"We expect continuing bankruptcies and consolidations to create even more
 opportunities for Ryanair to grow. If oil prices remain at approx. $80 pbl next
 year then our earnings will rebound strongly. We have a significant cost
 advantage over our competitors many of whom have hedged fuel next year at
 significantly higher levels than current market prices. This will force
 competitors to further increase airfares and widen the price gap between them
 and Ryanair's lowest fares. With one of the strongest balance sheets in the
 airline industry, EUR2.1bn in cash and the lowest cost base, Ryanair is strongly
 positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that will inevitably arise
 from the financial crisis and economic recession over the coming year".
To celebrate these half year results today we have today launched a 1 million
 seat sale with EUR10 inclusive fares on every seat, every flight ( Monday to
 Thursday plus Saturday), across 250 routes for travel in late November, early
 December 2008 and January. These EUR10 seats are available for sale this week only
 on www.ryanair.com.
