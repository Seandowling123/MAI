(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC is considering a move to a listing in Brussels from Dublin currently, the 
Sunday Times reported. 
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said there is "no reason" why the company should be listed in Dublin over 
Brussels, according to the Sunday Times. 
The newspaper said that while Ryanair's Dublin listing is not under immediate threat, the firm is frustrated by its 
listing rules. O'Leary believes the listing rules are too closely aligned with the London Stock Exchange's, instead of 
other Euronext NV arenas. The Dublin stock exchange forms part of the Euronext group.

Ryanair had completed its delisting from the LSE in December 2021, blaming shrivelling post-Brexit trading 
volumes in London for the move. It has a primary listing in Dublin. 
A departure for Ryanair would be a blow to the Dublin market. Building materials firm CRH PLC's delisting from 
Dublin comes into effect on Monday. It will continue to trade in London, though its primary listing will be in New 
York. It will depart the blue-chip FTSE 100 index as a result, being replaced by kitchen supplier Howden Joinery 
Group PLC.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) has ditched seventeen of its routes out of Dublin Airport for the winter season in 
a row over incentives for more sustainable aircraft and passenger charges.
Some 19 of its Boeing 737 MAX jets will be relocated under the move to European airports and the likes of Luton in 
the UK.
Though the move will lead to a 10% reduction in capacity on last year, according to boss Eddie Wilson, it could see 
Ryanair avoid paying increased passenger charges to fund development at the airport.
 Today Ryanair announces Dublin airport will lose 17 routes & 19 enviro friendly aircraft due to DAA 45% increase 
in costs. - Ryanair (@Ryanair) September 21, 2023
According to Ryanair, these costs are set to increase by as much as 45%, although The Dublin Airport Authority 
(DAA) disputed the figure.
"There are no incentives at Dublin to grow traffic or reward investment in aircraft with lower carbon dioxide and 
noise emissions," the Irish carrier said.
"Unlike most other EU airports, the DAA is unfortunately focused on increasing passenger charges [...] and wasting 
[money]."
Dublin Airport boss Kenny Jacobs accused Ryanair of making false claims, adding that better infrastructure was 
needed at the site for safety reasons.

Ryanair selling practices face Italy probe as row escalates

Italy's competition watchdog is to investigate Ryanair over alleged abuse of its market power, widening the ambit of 
the clash between prime minister Giorgia Meloni's government and the Irish budget carrier.
The inquiry is focusing on Ryanair's efforts to sell non-aviation services on its booking platform, the watchdog said 
in a statement yesterday. The authority has received complaints since May that the Irish airline is taking advantage 
of its "dominant position" to "extend its market power" by offering travel-related services such as hotels and rental 
cars on its ticket-selling platform, it said.
A preliminary assessment had indicated that Ryanair's business tactics, which include discouraging consumers 
from purchasing airline tickets through travel agencies, are "harming travel agencies, both online and offline, as well 
as clients that buy from such agencies," the authority added.
Ryanair is embroiled in a long-running dispute with Europe's largest online travel agents, including 
www.Booking.com and Expedia, and has called on all passengers to book through its own website.
Ryanair did not immediately comment on the antitrust investigation.
The inquiry comes a day after Rome scrapped plans to cap ticket prices on routes from Italy's mainland to the 
islands of Sicily and Sardinia, after ticket prices surged more than 70 per cent during this summer's holiday rush.
Ryanair selling practices face Italy probe as row escalates
Industry minister Adolfo Urso said that Rome was instead giving enhanced powers to the competition authority to 
monitor pricing trends, and to intervene if they felt that prices had jumped too high.
The proposal to cap prices had provoked uproar among European airlines.
Trade body Airlines for Europe sent a formal protest to Brussels, while companies' executives questioned how the 
measure, which was supposed to be based on past average prices, would work in practice. Ryanair announced it 
was cutting back its winter flight schedule flights to Sardinia in response.
The new antitrust investigation into Ryanair's selling practices comes as airlines increasingly seek to "upsell" extra 
products, such as car rentals, hotel rooms and travel insurance, to customers through their booking platforms.

Body
Italy's competition watchdog is to investigate Ryanair over alleged abuse of its market power, widening the ambit of 
the clash between prime minister Giorgia Meloni's government and the Irish budget carrier.
The inquiry is focusing on Ryanair's efforts to sell non-aviation services on its booking platform, the watchdog said 
in a statement yesterday. The authority has received complaints since May that the Irish airline is taking advantage 
of its "dominant position" to "extend its market power" by offering travel-related services such as hotels and rental 
cars on its ticket-selling platform, it said.
A preliminary assessment had indicated that Ryanair's business tactics, which include discouraging consumers 
from purchasing airline tickets through travel agencies, are "harming travel agencies, both online and offline, as well 
as clients that buy from such agencies," the authority added.
Ryanair is embroiled in a long-running dispute with Europe's largest online travel agents, including 
www.Booking.com and Expedia, and has called on all passengers to book through its own website.
Ryanair did not immediately comment on the antitrust investigation.
The inquiry comes a day after Rome scrapped plans to cap ticket prices on routes from Italy's mainland to the 
islands of Sicily and Sardinia, after ticket prices surged more than 70 per cent during this summer's holiday rush.

Highlight: The low budget airline is already in contention with Italian authorities over a price cap for domestic flight 
to the country's islands.
Body
The Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) has opened an investigation into Ryanair over alleged abuse of its 
dominant power in the travel industry to extend its power into other markets such as hotels and car rentals. The 
AGCM released a statement claiming that its preliminary view found Ryanair's leveraging of its dominant position 
could harm travel agencies, particularly by possibly impeding travel agencies from directly acquiring tickets through 
their own sites. The statement explained: "Ryanair's conduct seeks to restrict travel agencies from selling airline 
tickets, which is typically the initial step in planning a holiday and a crucial entry point for selling additional services. 
"As such, it could have adverse consequences on both travel agencies and end-consumers, leading to a 
deterioration of conditions, both in terms of quantity and quality and unjustified difficulties in managing 
reservations."  AGCM's statement also spelled out its belief that Ryanair limited traditional travel agencies' use of 
the GDS platform to purchase tickets and subjected them to less favourable pricing and a more limited range of 
available flights.  The investigation will likely serve to heighten the existing tension between Ryanair and Italian 
authorities, which have already come to loggerheads over the Italian Government's newly introduced price cap for 
domestic flights to the country's islands, which limits dynamically adjusting tariffs during peak periods of demand.  
Upon announcing its winter schedule for the country, Ryanair reported a 10% cut in domestic flights to and from 
Sicily, blaming the price cap, which it claims will result in higher overall fares due to a reduction in capacity.  CEO 
Eddie Wilson said: "Community law guarantees airlines the freedom to set prices, but this illegitimate decree 
damages domestic traffic and, unfortunately, has forced Ryanair to cut its Italian network to/from Sicily by 10%, with 
the unintended consequence of reduced choice and increase fares for Sicilians. Ryanair has amply demonstrated 
its commitment to the Sicilian market to date."

The low-cost airline will transfer the new planes to other airports in Europe and the UK, saying the decision was a

 Ryanair's (RYA.IR) Ryanair DAC Chief Executive Officer Eddie Wilson said it would be "politically impossible" for 
the European Union to implement minimum prices or compulsory limits on flights as it would disenfranchise poorer 
people.
The executive made the statement after French Transport Minister Clement Beaune said he would lobby a 
minimum price on flights in Europe to other member countries of the bloc, citing the aviation sector's contribution to 
climate change, Reuters reported Thursday. EU officials said the Netherlands and Belgium expressed in-principle 
support for the proposal.
Wilson added that the use of sustainable fuels and larger, less noisy aircraft will help cut emissions from the airline 
industry.
The ultra-low-cost airline was down about 2% late morning Thursday.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) is facing an investigation in Italy over suspicions the low-cost Irish carrier has 
been abusing its dominant position in the country's travel sector.
"In [our] preliminary view, Ryanair is leveraging on its dominant position in several markets of air transport sector in 
order to extend its market power," the Italian Competition Authority said on Wednesday.
According to the regulator, Ryanair has sought to restrict travel agencies' ability to sell tickets for its flights.
This is done by preventing travel agencies from purchasing tickets through its website, limiting their ability to sell 
travel alongside accommodation, the regulator said.
"Ryanair's conduct seeks to restrict travel agencies from selling airline tickets, which is typically the initial step in 
planning a holiday and a crucial entry point for selling additional services," the authority added.
"As such, it could have adverse consequences on both travel agencies and end-consumers."
Given Ryanair also offers customers deals on hotels, as well as car rental services, the regulator argued the 
practice of limiting tickets for others to sell was a bid to extend its power.
Alongside easyJet PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ), Ryanair is already under scrutiny by Italian 
authorities over alleged price-fixing on flights to and from neighbouring Sicily. 
Lower-cost airlines make much of their revenue from selling additional services such as priority boarding and extra 
baggage space, but also accommodation and airport transport.
Ryanair market dominance investigated in Italy
These add-ons, known as ancillary fees, generated a total of (EURO)1.18 billion for the Irish carrier during the first 
quarter-up 15%- of total revenue worth (EURO)3.65 billion.
Low-cost rival easyJet marked a 28% increase in ancillary revenue in its latest quarterly results meanwhile, to £622 
million, as passenger revenue climbed to £1.5 billion.
Per average passenger, Ryanair made (EURO)23.30 (£20.08) in ancillary revenue in the three months to June, 
while easyJet gained £23.75.
Some nations have moved to crack down on such sales, however, since passengers often end up paying far more 
than the price of their originally advertised ticket.
Spain has already threatened fines pending an investigation. In the UK, such additional costs across different 
sectors are set to be the subject of a government consultation.

       The Italian Competition Authority AGCM Wednesday said it has opened an investigation on Ryanair Holdings' 
(RYAAY) Italian unit for an alleged exclusionary abuse of dominant position.
 The investigation has been initiated against Ryanair DAC, the first air carrier in Italy offering scheduled air transport 
services of passengers on national flights and flights to and from Italy.
 According to the Authority, the carrier's conduct would harm travel agencies and consumers by attempting to 
extend its market power into the provision of other tourist services, such as hotels and car rental. AGCM said the 
action was taken after receiving several reports since last May.
 In AGCM preliminary view, Ryanair DAC is leveraging on its dominant position in several markets of air transport 
sector harming travel agencies, both online and offline, as well as clients that buy from such agencies those other 
services.
 "In particular, on one side Ryanair appears to impede travel agencies from directly acquiring airline tickets through 
their own websites; on the other side, Ryanair permits the purchase of airline tickets exclusively for traditional travel 
agencies via the GDS platform, subjecting them to considerably less favorable conditions in terms of pricing, range 
of available services, and post-sale management of airline tickets," AGCM said.
 The Authority noted that Ryanair's conduct seeks to restrict travel agencies from selling airline tickets, which is 
typically the initial step in planning a holiday and a crucial entry point for selling additional services.
 As such, it could have adverse consequences on both travel agencies and end-consumers, leading to a 
deterioration of conditions, both in terms of quantity and quality, and unjustified difficulties in managing reservations.

(ANSA) - SEP 20 - Italy's antitrust authority said Wednesday that it had opened a probe into Ryanair for possible 
abuse of its dominant market position. It said the probe regarded reports it received from May onward over the 
airline's alleged attempts to "extend its market power" by offering additional services, such as hotel and car-hire 
bookings. The authority said it was looking into whether Ryanair was harming travel agencies - both online and 
offline ones - and consumers by doing so. 
It said Ryanair seems to hamper the acquisition of air tickets by travel agents directly from its site, while allowing 
traditional agencies to buy them via the GDS platform, but under less favourable conditions. The probe comes after 
the government dropped a controversial fare cap to services to Sicily and Sardinia included in a recent decree on 
air-transport prices but boosted the antitrust authority's powers to verify possible abuses. So a clampdown on 
airlines' "unfair" use of algorithms to set the price of tickets, which was linked to soaring flight prices in the summer, 
especially for services connecting the mainland to Sicily and Sardinia, remains. "The expensive-flights measure has 
been better calibrated to give more significant powers to the Antitrust to vanquish the algorithm, where it profiles 
users and creates price mechanism that could be called market distorting," Urso said. Ryanair CEO Eddie Wilson 
said that the antitrust probe into the low-cost airline was "welcome". "Let's hope that it is extended to other aspects 
(of the business) too, so that it leads to transparency for everyone," Wilson said at the presentation of the 
company's winter-season programme in Palermo. However, in a statement issued later in the day, the company 
also said it was "surprised that the antitrust authority has shown no interest in the fact that the prices of Ryanair 
flights and optional services on online travel agency sites are often up to 200% higher than the prices on 
Ryanair.com". "Ryanair continues to offer licensed access to its fares to compare prices on online platforms; travel 
agents can also access Ryanair inventory through our GDS partners," said the airline. In a letter to the European 
Commission, trade body Airlines for Europe (A4E) had contested the price cap, arguing that it could "set a 
precedent and lead to a domino effect" as well as "violating" the rights of companies to '"compete wherever 
possible, set prices and define services as they see fit". Wilson had also blasted the measure, describing it as 
"ridiculous, illegal and interfering with the free market, according to European law" and later announcing a 8% 
reduction in the air line's services to and from the Italian island region of Sardinia this winter as a direct result.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC is being probed in Italy over alleged market abuse which risks leaving 
travel agents out of pocket, the nation's competition watchdog said Wednesday. 
The Italian Competition Authority said it has kicked off its probe after receiving a number of reports since last May. 
The watchdog's preliminary view is that the Dublin-based carrier is "leveraging on its dominant position" in the travel 
sector to provide other tourist services, such as hotel and car rental bookings. This is harming travel agencies, the 
regulator said. 
"In particular, on one side Ryanair appears to impede travel agencies from directly acquiring airline tickets through

agencies via the [global distribution system] platform, subjecting them to considerably less favourable conditions in

the base effect caused by the very high price level of the previous year.
 The producer price index fell 12.6 percent year-over-year in August, much faster than the 6.0 percent decline in the 
prior month, which was the first decline since November 2020. That was in line with economists' expectations.
 Elsewhere, data showed the U.K. consumer price inflation slowed unexpectedly in August.
 U.K. consumer price index posted an annual increase of 6.7 percent in August after rising 6.8 percent in July, 
according to the Office for National Statistics. This was the weakest inflation since February 2022.

Italy's antitrust watchdog said Wednesday it has opened an investigation into Ryanair over allegations the Irish low-
cost airline is abusing its dominant market position.
The Italian Competition Authority accused Ryanair, which is the leading airline in Italy in terms of routes and flights 
offered, of trying to "extend its market power" by offering other tourist services such as hotel and car rental 
reservations.
Ryanair, which offers national flights along with services to and from Italy, "appears to impede travel agencies from 
directly acquiring airline tickets" from its website, the regulator said.
Instead, travel agencies have to buy tickets via a reservation platform that subjects them to "considerably less 
favourable conditions" in terms of prices and services, it said.
"The carrier's conduct would harm travel agencies and consumers by attempting to extend its market power into the 
provision of other tourist services," the authority said.
Ryanair issued a typically defiant statement in response. It welcomed the probe, which it said "will make it clear to 
passengers that they should book directly" on its website, for the best fares and up to date information.
It expressed surprise that there was no investigation into why Ryanair flights and services offered by online travel 
agents were often far higher than those on its own site.
The watchdog's investigation comes the day after Italy's hard-right government indicated it would withdraw its 
controversial plan to cap prices of flights to and from its islands.
The cap was approved by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's right-wing government last month but must still go 
through parliament.

Ryanair had declared the move illegal and complained to the European Commission, before announcing that in 
response, it would reduce the number of flights to Sardinia and Sicily.
According to Italy's civil aviation industry, Ryanair carried 45.7 million passengers in 2022, the market leader with 
some 37 percent of the national and international market.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.IR) is facing an antitrust investigation in Italy for alleged abuse of its dominant position with 
a foray into other tourist services, according to a Wednesday release.
The Italian Competition Authority launched the inquiry after receiving several complaints since May 2022. Following 
a preliminary investigation, the watchdog believes that Ryanair is using its leading position in a number of air 
transport markets to offer additional tourist services that are harming travel agencies. The services include hotels 
and car rentals.
The airline is also subjecting travel agencies to less favorable conditions in the acquisition of air tickets, the 
regulator added.
Ryanair gained nearly 1% on Wednesday morning.

(ANSA) - SEP 20 - Business Minister Adolfo Urso said Wednesday that the probe Italy's Antitrust authority has 
opened into Ryanair was "an important signal for a market that needs maximum transparency to protect fair 
competition between operators, and (to protect) users". The probe comes after the government dropped a fare cap 
to services to Sicily and Sardinia included in a recent decree on air-transport prices but boosted the antitrust 
authority's powers to verify possible abuses. So a clampdown on airlines' "unfair" use of algorithms to set the price 
of tickets, which was linked to soaring flight prices in the summer, especially for services connecting the mainland to 
Sicily and Sardinia, remains. "The expensive-flights measure has been better calibrated to give more significant 
powers to the Antitrust to vanquish the algorithm, where it profiles users and creates price mechanism that could be 
called market distorting," Urso said.

(ANSA) - SEP 20 - Italy's antitrust authority said Wednesday that it had opened a probe into Ryanair for possible 
abuse of its dominant market position. It said the probe regarded reports it received from May onward over the 
airline's alleged attempts to "extend its market power" by offering additional services, such as hotel and car-hire 
bookings. The authority said it was looking into whether Ryanair was harming travel agencies - both online and 
offline ones - and consumers by doing so. It said Ryanair seems to hamper the acquisition of air tickets by travel 
agents directly from its site, while allowing traditional agencies to buy them via the GDS platform, but under less 
favourable conditions.

in a statement Wednesday. "In this way, we will then be able to communicate directly with (passengers) to ensure 
that they make the necessary security declarations and are informed of all security protocols and regulations, as 
required by law," said Ryanair. "However, we are surprised that the antitrust authority has shown no interest in the 
fact that the prices of Ryanair flights and optional services on online travel agency sites are often up to 200% higher 
than the prices on Ryanair.com," it added. "Ryanair continues to offer licensed access to its fares to compare prices 
on online platforms; travel agents can also access Ryanair inventory through our GDS partners," it concluded.

Government rethinks air fare cap rules (3) Gives powers to antitrust authority
Government rethinks air fare cap rules (3); Gives powers to antitrust

(ANSA) - SEP 19 - The government of Premier Giorgia Meloni has reconsidered controversial new rules concerning 
air fares on certain domestic routes, it emerged on Tuesday. In an amendment to the so-called Asset decree 
currently before parliament for conversion into law, the executive has eliminated the price cap of 200% of the 
average fare and given the Italian antitrust authority powers to verify possible abuses. "The conduct exercised (by 
airlines) on the routes to the islands, the period of peak seasonal demand, and prices that are more than 200% 
above the average fare are considered circumstances and indications that the Authority can take into account," 
reads the technical report. 
In a letter to the European Commission trade body Airlines for Europe (A4E) contested the price cap, arguing that it 
could "set a precedent and lead to a domino effect" as well as "violating" the rights of companies to '"compete 
wherever possible, set prices and define services as they see fit". Ryanair CEO Eddie Wilson also blasted the 
measure, describing it as "ridiculous, illegal and interfering with the free market, according to European law" and 
later announcing  a 8% reduction in the air line's services to and from the Italian island region of Sardinia this winter 
as a direct result. However, ENAC President Pierluigi Di Palma said an "oligopoly" had formed in the Italian 
domestic air-transport market. "Particularly in the case of Ryanair, which has bought other companies like Air Malta. 
"It's clear there is a no longer a free market, but the imposition of the price and little consumer protection," he said. 
Antitrust Authority President Roberto Rustichelli, meanwhile, told a Senate hearing on the law conversion bill that 
the measure did not hinder airlines' ability to "independently set their price policies", adding that it appeared to try to 
impede "illegal exploitation of market power to the damage of particularly vulnerable consumers".

 The Zacks Airline[1]industry has been benefiting from buoyant air travel demand, following the easing of COVID-19 
travel restrictions and the reopening of the global economy. The industry is witnessing a solid recovery in demand 
for domestic as well as international flights. People are again booking flights, thereby leading to higher passenger 
revenues, which contribute to the bulk of most airlines' top lines. 
Notably, the Zacks Airline[1]industry has risen 6.4% so far this year, outperforming 5.9% growth of the broader 
Zacks Transportation[2]sector. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Driven by the buoyant scenario with respect to air traffic, Copa Holdings CPA[3], Azul S.A. AZUL[4], Gol Linhas 
Aereas Inteligentes GOL[5] and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[6] reported impressive traffic numbers for August. Each 
of the aforementioned stocks presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's 
Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7]. 
Let's take an in-depth look at these companies' August traffic reports. 
Driven by high passenger volumes, Copa Holdings' revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) rose in double 
digits in August on a year-over-year basis. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In August, 
available seat miles (a measure of capacity) increased 12.8% year over year. Revenue passenger miles increased 
13.3%. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) 
improved to 87% from 86.6% in August 2022. 
Brazilian carrier, Azul reported double-digit year-over-year increases in traffic and capacity for August 2023. 
In August, the Brazilian carrier's consolidated revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of air traffic) and available 
seat kilometers (a measure of capacity) increased 13.5% and 13.1%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. With 
consolidated passenger traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (the percentage of seats filled 
by passengers) improved to 81.6% from 81.3% in August 2022. 
On the domestic front, with revenue passenger kilometers (7.5%) outpacing available seat kilometers (6.8%), the 
load factor increased to 80.2% from 79.7% in August 2022. 
Internationally, revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 38.4% and 41.8%, 
respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The load factor was 86.3%. 
Airlines Post Impressive August Traffic Numbers: An Analysis

In August, consolidated revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of air traffic) and available seat kilometers (a 
measure of capacity) increased 11.6% and 7.7%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. With traffic growth 
outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) for August 2023 improved 
to 84.4% from 81.5% in August 2022. The number of flight departures at GOL in August registered a 17.8% year-
over-year increase. Consolidated passengers on board rose 22.4% year over year.

Internationally, the load factor increased to 82.7% from 82.3% in August 2022. 
Ryanair, a European carrier, also reported impressive traffic numbers for August 2023, driven by upbeat air-travel 
demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in August was 18.9 million, implying an increase of 
12% from a year ago. Owing to upbeat traffic, the load factor was as high as 96% in August. The reading was 
similar in the year-ago period.

(ANSA) - SEP 12 - Business and Made in Italy Minister Adolfo Urso said Tuesday that "Italy is a sovereign country 
and won't be blackmailed by anyone" after Ryanair Group CEO Michael O'Leary announced reductions in services 
over the government's flight-price decree. Urso also dismissed assertions that the decree was illegal, saying what 
was illegal was the conduct of an airline that "has been punished 11 times by the competition and market authority 
for having breached the market rules and the rights of consumers of this country". The decree, passed last month, 
effectively caps fares to Sicily and Sardinia. 
It clamps down on the use of algorithms to set flight prices amid claims that they were responsible for soaring fares 
in the summer. The decree bans the algorithms if applied to connections to Sicily and Sardinia; if applied to peaks 
in demand linked to seasonal factors; and if they lead to the price of tickets or accessory services being 200% 
higher than the average price. "The price decree is based on rubbish data," O' Leary said as he presented the 
company's winter services, arguing civil-aviation authority ENAC had given the government "false, inaccurate 
advice". "It is a stupid, idiotic decree, which will reduce flights by increasing fares. "We have already reduced flights 
by 10% to Sardinia and we will do this same for Sicily this winter". He added that the only new routes Ryanair would 
operated from Italy this winter would be international services, not domestic ones.

average price. "The price decree is based on rubbish data," O' Leary said as he presented the company's winter 
services, arguing civil-aviation authority ENAC had given the government "false, inaccurate advice". "It is a stupid, 
idiotic decree, which will reduce flights by increasing fares. "We have already reduced flights by 10% to Sardinia 
and we will do this same for Sicily this winter". He added that the only new routes Ryanair would operate from Italy 
this winter would be international services, not domestic ones. ENAC President Pierluigi Di Palma said O'Leary's 
comments were "surreal". He said an "oligopoly" had formed in the Italian domestic air-transport market. 
"particularly in the case of Ryanair, which has bought other companies like Air Malta. "It's clear there is a no longer 
a free market, but the imposition of the price and little consumer protection".

(ANSA) - SEP 12 - Business and Made in Italy Minister Adolfo Urso said Tuesday that "Italy is a sovereign country 
and won't be blackmailed by anyone" after Ryanair Group CEO Michael O'Leary announced reductions in services 
over the government's flight-price decree. Urso also dismissed assertions that the decree was illegal, saying what 
was illegal was the conduct of an airline that "has been punished 11 times by the competition and market authority 
for having breached the market rules and the rights of consumers of this country". The decree, passed last month, 
effectively caps fares to Sicily and Sardinia. It clamps down on the use of algorithms to set flight prices amid claims 
that they were responsible for soaring fares in the summer.

particularly vulnerable consumers".

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) filed a complaint to the European Union in response to Italy's new airfare cap to curb rising 
airfares, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday. 
Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary deemed the decree as "illegal and completely unenforceable" and said the 
airline may consider reducing flights in the country if the government continues to maintain the price cap.
The government decree, approved by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's cabinet in August, aims to restrict the use of 
algorithms to set ticket prices following the collapse of ITA Airways' predecessor Alitalia, and the pullback of other 
carriers during the pandemic, the report noted.
Shares of the budget airline were up 3% in morning trading.

Vietnam Airlines to expand fleet with Boeing 737 MAX order
Vietnam Airlines to expand fleet with Boeing 737 MAX order

Highlight: Vietnam Airlines has chosen Boeing's 737 MAX to expand its single-aisle fleet with a multi-billion-dollar 
commitment to order 50 of the 737-8 aeroplanes, announced as part of a partnership between the US and Vietnam.
Body
The announcement was designed to coincide with US President Joe Biden's visit to Vietnam as the two countries 
look to build closer diplomatic ties. Dang Ngoc Hoa, chairman of the board of directors for Vietnam Airlines, said: "In 
line with Vietnam Airlines' 2025-2030 fleet strategy and a vision to 2035, aircraft investment is a crucial project that 
underpins positive recovery momentum and a prosperous outlook for the airline.  "The new narrow-body fleet will 
allow us to foster our overall development and extend our high-quality service on Vietnam Airlines' domestic and 
Asian routes, as well as modernising our fuel-efficient fleet." According to Boeing, the 737 MAX aircraft offers a 
20% reduction in emissions and a smaller noise footprint than similar planes. 
The expansion of the Vietnam Airlines fleet continues work on its home country's goal of becoming an international 
aviation hub and will significantly expand its existing Boeing fleet, which includes 15 787 Dreamliner planes. The 
airline has been building on a growing need for single-aisle aircraft, with current orders seeing its fleet grow by 60 
aircraft by 2030 and 100 aircraft by 2035. It currently has a total fleet of 100 aircraft, including 65 narrow-bodies. 
Boeing's senior vice-president of commercial sales and marketing Brad McMullen celebrated the manufacturer's 28-
year relationship with the airline, adding: "Southeast Asia is one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets and 
the 737 MAX is the perfect aeroplane for Vietnam Airlines to efficiently meet that regional demand." The latest order 
continues a successful year for the 737 family, which has seen large orders from Air India and Ryanair with 
Boeing's Q2 2023 report highlighting a ramping up of 737 production up to 38 completions a month.

 H2Fly, acquired by Joby Aviation JOBY[1] in 2021, created a buzz in the aviation space by achieving a milestone 
that no other company has accomplished so far. H2Fly announced that it has completed a series of liquid hydrogen-
powered piloted flights of its four-seater HY4 demonstrator. 
One of the flights lasted for more than three hours. Previously, H2Fly had completed flights powered by pressurized 
gaseous hydrogen. 
The successful completion of these flights demonstrates the utility of employing cryogenically-stored liquid 
hydrogen instead of gaseous hydrogen. The usage leads to significantly lower tank weights and volume, which, in 
turn, leads to longer range. 
The success of flights with liquid hydrogen is expected to increase the range of H2FLY's HY4 demonstrator aircraft 
from 750 km to 1500 km. This is in-line with the achievement of the long-term goal of decarbonization of mid-to-long 
range aviation. 
The achievement of this milestone implies the ending of Project HEAVEN, a European government-backed 
consortium led by H2FLY, on a happy note. The consortium was created to explore the use of cryogenic liquid 
hydrogen in planes. Following this achievement, JOBY's wholly-owned subsidiary will now shift its focus on the path 
to commercialization. 
Expressing delight on this accomplishment Joby Aviation's founder and CEO, JoeBen Bevirt, said, 'H2FLY are 
pioneers in their field, and we're proud of them achieving this watershed moment in the use of liquid hydrogen to 
power aircraft." Zacks Rank & Key Picks Joby Aviation currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). 
Investors interested in the Zacks Transportation [2]sector may consider stocks like Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] and 
Air Transport Services Group ATSG[4]. Each stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can seethe 
complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[5]. 
Ryanair Holdings' growth prospects are being supported by an upbeat in air-travel-demand scenario. An uptick in 
passenger volumes is leading the company to post impressive traffic numbers over the past few months. 
Measures for expanding its fleet to cater to the rising travel demand are encouraging as well. Riding on the buoyant 
air-traffic scenario, RYAAY shares have gained 28.5% year to date. RYAAY surpassed the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters by 21.4%, on average. 
JOBY 's Unit Completes Liquid H2-Powered Piloted Flights
An uptrend with respect to e-commerce, even in the post-pandemic scenario, is a huge positive for Air Transport 
Services. It is the primary driver behind an uptick in demand for midsize air freighters. 
Driven by the upbeat demand, ATSG delivered a record six converted freighters under lease in a month to its 
customers worldwide. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ATSG's current-year earnings has been revised 11.2% 
upward over the past 60 days. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double"  
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months

Meloni pushes EU to give thumbs up to Lufthansa - ITA airline deal
Meloni pushes EU to give thumbs up to Lufthansa-ITA airline deal
dpa international (Englischer Dienst)

Dateline: New Delhi/Rome (dpa) - 
Body
Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is putting pressure on the European Commission to back an agreement where 
German airline Lufthansa would take over a minority stake in the Italian airline ITA.
"It is strange that the European Commission is blocking the solution to the ITA problem," Meloni said on Sunday 
after the G20 summit wrapped up in New Delhi.
Lufthansa is to take over a 41% stake in ITA, which was formed in 2020 after a restructuring of the failed carrier 
Alitalia, for an initial investment of (EURO)325 million ($348 million).
The Italian government took control of the airline in March 2020 when various takeover bids failed.
After months of negotiations, the German MDax-listed Lufthansa Group and Rome announced the deal at the end 
of April.
The European Commission must still approve the agreement.
The decision is the responsibility of the EU Economy Commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni.
Gentiloni, a social democrat and former Italian prime minister, belongs to a rival political party to Meloni's far-right 
party Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy).
The deal is subject to competition law reviews at both a national and European level.
EU competition authorities are expected to pay particular attention to whether a monopoly situation is created at the 
airports in Rome and Milan.
Meloni pushes EU to give thumbs up to Lufthansa - ITA airline deal
At present, the Lufthansa Group only attracts transfer passengers from wealthier northern Italy to the Munich hub 
with flights operated by Air Dolomiti.
Now, with ITA, Lufthansa is acquiring a market share in an environment dominated by non-domestic low-cost 
carriers such as Ryanair and Easyjet.
Deutsche Lufthansa AG has already taken over the former state-owned airlines of neighbouring Switzerland, 
Austria and Belgium and has continued to operate them as independent brands.
The Belgian Sabena successor Brussels Airlines was taken over by Lufthansa in two stages, initially also starting 
with a minority stake.
Lufthansa is also looking to possibly take over Portugal's TAP.

In the past week, management of airline heavyweights — United Airlines  UAL , Alaska Air Group  ALK  and 
Southwest Airlines  LUV  increased their respective projections for third-quarter 2023 fuel price per gallon. Hawaiian 
Holdings  HA , meanwhile, revised its projections downward for key metrics for third-quarter as well as full-year 
2023.
The devastation caused by wildfire to the Lahaina town in West Maui resulted in dull projections. Also, issues with 
RTX's Pratt & Whitney engines that power Airbus' popular A320neo jets added to the woes. We note that HA's fleet 
includes A320neo jets with engines, which need to be inspected following problems identified by Pratt & Whitney. 
European carrier, Ryanair Holdings  RYAAY , grabbed headlines by virtue of its stellar traffic numbers for the month 
of August.
Read the Last Airline Roundup here
Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories
1. United Airlines' management stated that 'since mid-July 2023, jet fuel prices have climbed over 20%'. United 
Airlinesnow expects the fuel cost per gallon in the $2.95-$3.05 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.5-$2.8 
range). Southwest Airlines now expects the fuel cost per gallon in the $2.7-$2.8 band (the earlier guidance was in 
the $2.55-$2.65 range). Operating revenue per available seat mile for the third quarter of 2023 is now expected to 
decline in the 5-7% band from third-quarter 2022 actuals (the earlier projection was for a 3-7% decline).
Alaska Air now expects the fuel cost per gallon in the $3.15-$3.25 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.7-$2.8 
range). Due to high costs, the third-quarter adjusted pre-tax margin is now expected in the 10-12% range (earlier 
guidance was 14-16%). Total revenues are now expected to increase in the 1-2% range from third-quarter 2022 
actuals (the earlier projection was for a 0-3% increase). Non-fuel unit costs are now expected to be down 1-2% 
(earlier guidance: down 0-2%). Available seat miles (a measure of capacity) are now expected to be up 
approximately 13% in third-quarter 2023 from the third-quarter 2022 actuals (earlier guidance: up 10-13%)
Airline Stock Roundup: UAL , ALK & LUV 's Q3 Fuel Cost Warning, HA's Dull View
2. Ryanair, currently sporting a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy), reported highly impressive traffic numbers for the 
month of August, driven by upbeat air travel demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in 
August was 18.9 million, implying that 12% more passengers flew than a year ago. This was an all-time monthly 
high traffic number. Owing to upbeat traffic, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was as high 
as 96%  in August.
3. For the third quarter of 2023, available seat miles or ASM are now projected by HA to increase 4-5.5% from third-
quarter 2022 levels (earlier guidance: 4.5-7.5% rise). Total revenues per available seat miles are now anticipated to 
decrease 4-7% from third-quarter 2022 levels (prior projection: 2-5% decline). Fuel price per gallon is now expected 
at $2.91 in third-quarter 2023 (the earlier view was $2.67). The effective tax rate is still anticipated to be 21% in the 
third quarter. ASMs are now projected  to climb in the 8-10% band for full-year 2023 (earlier guidance: 8.5-10.5% 
jump).

 Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL) recently reported a double-digit year-over-year increase in traffic and 
capacity for August 2023. 
In August, consolidated revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of air traffic) and available seat kilometers (a 
measure of capacity) increased 11.6% and 7.7%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. With traffic growth 
outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) for August 2023 improved 
to 84.4% from 81.5% in August 2022. The number of flight departures at GOL in August registered a 17.8% year-
over-year increase. Consolidated passengers on board rose 22.4% year over year. 
On the domestic front, with revenue passenger kilometers (13.7%) outpacing available seat kilometers (9.4%), the 
load factor increased to 84.6% from 81.4% in August 2022. 
Internationally, the load factor increased to 82.7% from 82.3% in August 2022. 
Domestic departures, accounting for more than 95% of total departures during the month, grew 18.1% on a year-
over-year basis. On the domestic front, the number of seats increased 21.8% in August. International departures 
increased 11.7% in August on a year-over-year basis. The number of seats rose 17.4% internationally. 
On the domestic front, passengers on board rose 22.7% year over year. Internationally, the metric increased 13% 
year over year. 
Given the buoyant traffic scenario, Gol Linhas is not the only airline to report impressive traffic numbers for August. 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1], a European carrier, also reported impressive traffic numbers for August 2023, driven 
by upbeat air-travel demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in August was 18.9 million, 
implying an increase of 12% from a year ago. Owing to upbeat traffic, the load factor was as high as 96% in August.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GATX's current-year earnings has improved 2.1% over the past 90 days. 
Shares of GATX have gained 6% year to date. 
SkyWest's fleet-modernization efforts are commendable. A fall in operating expenses is a tailwind for SkyWest. In 
second-quarter 2023, the metric dipped 2.4% to $693.8 million due to a decline in operating costs. Low operating 
expenses boost bottom-line results. Shares of SKYW have surged 163.6% year to date.

Sep 08, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, management of airline heavyweights --- United Airlines UAL[1], Alaska Air Group ALK[2] and 
Southwest Airlines LUV[3] increased their respective projections for third-quarter 2023 fuel price per gallon. 
Hawaiian Holdings HA[4], meanwhile, revised its projections downward for key metrics for third-quarter as well as 
full-year 2023. 
The devastation caused by wildfire to the Lahaina town in West Maui resulted in dull projections. Also, issues with 
RTX's Pratt & Whitney engines that power Airbus' popular A320neo jets added to the woes. We note that HA's fleet 
includes A320neo jets with engines, which need to be inspected following problems identified by Pratt & Whitney. 
European carrier, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5], grabbed headlines by virtue of its stellar traffic numbers for the 
month of August. 
Read the Last Airline Roundup here[6] Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. United Airlines' 
management stated that 'since mid-July 2023, jet fuel prices have climbed over 20%'. United Airlinesnow expects 
the fuel cost per gallon in the $2.95-$3.05 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.5-$2.8 range). Southwest 
Airlines now expects the fuel cost per gallon in the $2.7-$2.8 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.55-$2.65 
range). Operating revenue per available seat milefor the third quarter of 2023 is now expected to decline in the 5-
7% band from third-quarter 2022 actuals (the earlier projection was for a 3-7% decline). 
Alaska Air now expects the fuel cost per gallon in the $3.15-$3.25 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.7-$2.8 
range). Due to high costs, the third-quarter adjusted pre-tax margin is now expected in the 10-12% range (earlier 
guidance was 14-16%). Total revenues are now expected to increase in the 1-2% range from third-quarter 2022 
actuals (the earlier projection was for a 0-3% increase). Non-fuel unit costs are now expected to be down 1-2% 
(earlier guidance: down 0-2%). Available seat miles (a measure of capacity) are now expected to be up 
approximately 13% in third-quarter 2023 from the third-quarter 2022 actuals (earlier guidance: up 10-13%) 
2. Ryanair, currently sporting a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy), reported highly impressive traffic numbers for the 
month of August, driven by upbeat air travel demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in 
August was 18.9 million, implying that 12% more passengers flew than a year ago. This was an all-time monthly 
Airline Stock Roundup: UAL , ALK & LUV 's Q3 Fuel Cost Warning, HA's Dull View
high traffic number. Owing to upbeat traffic, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was as high 
as 96%[7] in August. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[8]. 
3. For the third quarter of 2023, available seat miles or ASM are now projected by HA to increase 4-5.5% from third-
quarter 2022 levels (earlier guidance: 4.5-7.5% rise). Total revenues per available seat miles are now anticipated to 
decrease 4-7% from third-quarter 2022 levels (prior projection: 2-5% decline). Fuel price per gallon is now expected 
at $2.91 in third-quarter 2023 (the earlier view was $2.67). The effective tax rate is still anticipated to be 21% in the 
third quarter. ASMs are now projected[9] to climb in the 8-10% band for full-year 2023 (earlier guidance: 8.5-10.5% 
jump). Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past

Ryanair cuts Sardinia services in response to price cap (3); Airline 
announces 8% reduction in operations this winter

Body
(ANSA) - SEP 7 - Ryanair on Thursday announced a 8% reduction in its services to and from the Italian island 
region of Sardinia this winter. The airline said the move is a direct result of a recent government decision to cap 
fares to Sicily and Sardinia. 
In total 10 routes have been affected including three that have been cancelled, Ryanair said. "Unfortunately, I am 
here to announce something that we certainly would not have wanted," Chief Commercial Officer Jason Mc 
Guinness told reporters in Cagliari. "A reduction of almost 10% compared to the planned schedule is entirely linked 
to the Italian government's decree, which we consider totally illegal and which will only have the effect of reducing 
connectivity," he added. In early August the government of Premier Giorgia Meloni approved a decree clamping 
down on the use of algorithms to set flight prices amid claims that they were responsible for soaring fares in recent 
months, especially for services connecting the mainland to Sicily and Sardinia in the absence of alternative road or 
rail links. The decree bans the algorithms if applied to connections to Sicily and Sardinia; if applied to peaks in 
demand linked to seasonal factors; and if they lead to the price of tickets or accessory services being 200% higher 
than the average price. Ryanair CEO Eddie Wilson immediately blasted the measure as "ridiculous, illegal and 
interfering with the free market, according to European law", and called for it to be cancelled. The European 
Commission said it had asked for clarifications from Rome, adding that price capping is rarely an effective means of 
achieving affordable prices.

Regulator will probe air traffic control system failure Bank holiday chaos
Regulator will probe air traffic control system failure; Bank holiday chaos

Body
The aviation regulator is to launch a review of the failure of the air traffic control system over the August bank 
holiday, which grounded hundreds of aircraft and left thousands of passengers stranded.
The move by the Civil Aviation Authority comes after an interim report by National Air Traffic Services found that a 
"logic error" occurred after a part of its system incorrectly processed a flight plan from an airline that was due to fly 
over UK airspace.
As airlines stepped up calls for their costs to be covered, Nats said the failure was a "one in 15mn event". The 
company described it as "an extremely rare set of circumstances presented by a flight plan that included two 
identically named, but separate, way point markers outside UK airspace".
The outage on August 28 was the worst in more than a decade and led to the cancellation of over 1,500 flights on 
the day, with more on subsequent days as airlines recovered their schedules.
Tim Alderslade, chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, said carriers were "seeking clarity on what options 
exist for Nats to cover our costs".
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, criticised the Nats report as a "whitewash", adding that it played down 
the impact of the outage on the industry. He said the disruption had left the low-cost airline with a bill of between 
£15mn and £20mn in passenger refunds.
Regulator will probe air traffic control system failure Bank holiday chaos
Nats chief executive Martin Rolfe said the incident was caused by a specific flight plan. "That flight plan that the 
airline entered was not faulty ... However, it presented data to our systems that had never been seen before and it 
did it in a way that generated a logic error ... it was our system that didn't process the flight plan."
Nats stressed that air safety was not compromised and that a similar scenario had not been encountered by a 
system which, in its five years in service, had processed more than 15mn flight plans. The company said it had 
implemented a fix to avoid any recurrence.

Highlight: APEXX Global, the global payments orchestration platform, has partnered with Klarna, offering its BNPL 
solution, APEXX Connect, to merchants globally.
Body
APEXX Connect, which allows merchants to host multiple BNPL services via a single API, has integrated Klarna. 
The collaboration opens up the travel sector for Klarna. The companies say that the alliance will help APEXX's 
merchants reduce their transaction costs, increase sales and access Klarna's widespread customer base. 
APEXX is a one stop shop for all merchant payment needs - as it is partner agnostic, APEXX can route domestic 
and cross border payments in the most efficient and cost-effective way. This helps other businesses like Ryanair, 
CarTrawler and Avon to reduce payment cost and increase payment speed and conversion rates. The payments 
system has historically been balanced completely in favour of the card schemes to the detriment of merchants - 
APEXX is changing that. The partnership between APEXX and Klarna is already in effect. Brian Joseph, VP, 
Partnerships at APEXX Global said: "We are proud to partner with a market-leading payments network in Klarna. 
This aligns with our mission to provide the most innovative solutions to our merchants. APEXX Connect will now be 
available in over 50 markets. This is testament to our commitment to serving a global clientele in every major

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary got a rude welcome in Brussels on Thursday when he received two cream pies to 
the face while standing next to a cardboard cutout of EU chief Ursula von der Leyen.
The tarts were landed by two women environmental activists as O'Leary was holding a one-man protest outside the 
European Commission against repeated air traffic controllers' strikes in the EU impacting his low-cost Irish airline, 
Europe's biggest by passenger numbers.
"Welcome in Belgium," said one of the activists as she planted her pie, according to video of the scene broadcast 
by Belgian news channels LN24 and RTL Info.
"Stop the pollution" from planes said the other activist as she smeared her pastry on O'Leary before both walked 
off.
The Ryanair chief, who regularly courts publicity, laughed off the stunt, calmly telling an assistant to take his soiled 
jacket away to be cleaned.
Ryanair's feed on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, later posted that O'Leary got a "warm welcome in 
Brussels".
"Passengers so happy with our routes and petition that they're celebrating with cake," it said.
The activists' pie protest came as Ryanair pilots in Belgium announced a new strike on September 14 and 15 - their 
fourth stoppage in two months - over pay and working conditions.

region of Sardinia this winter. The airline said the move is a direct result of a recent government decision to cap 
fares to Sicily and Sardinia. In total 10 routes have been affected including three that have been cancelled, Ryanair 
said. "Unfortunately, I am here to announce something that we certainly would not have wanted," Chief Commercial 
Officer Jason Mc Guinness told reporters in Cagliari. "A reduction of almost 10% compared to the planned schedule 
is entirely linked to the Italian government's decree, which we consider totally illegal and which will only have the 
effect of reducing connectivity," he added.

Sep 07, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence 
are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both. 
The popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to 
daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and 
Premium stock screens. 
Zacks Premium also includes the Zacks Style Scores. 
What are the Zacks Style Scores? 
The Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and 
were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose 
securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days. 
Each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. 
Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the 
better chance the stock will outperform. 
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories: 
Value Score 
Finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what 
value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, 
Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks. 
Growth Score 
Growth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength 
of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, 
and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time. 
Momentum Score 
Momentum traders and investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." This investing style is all about taking 
advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week 
Why Ryanair (RYAAY) is a Top Value Stock for the Long-Term
price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate 
favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks. 
VGM Score 
If you like to use all three kinds of investing, then the VGM Score is for you. It's a combination of all Style Scores, 
and is an important indicator to use with the Zacks Rank. The VGM Score rates each stock on their shared 
weighted styles, narrowing down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most 
promising momentum. 
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank 
The Zacks Rank, which is a proprietary stock-rating model, employs earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a 
company's earnings expectations, to make building a winning portfolio easier. 
Investors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% 
average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large 
number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, 
on any given day. 
But it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks 
to choose from. 
That's where the Style Scores come in. 
To maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking 
stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a 
#3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible. 
The direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to 
buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank. 
A stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a 
declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too. 
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better. 
Stock to Watch: Ryanair (RYAAY) 
Ryanair Holdings is the parent company of Ryanair Designated Activity Company (formerly known as Ryanair 
Limited). Ryanair, which commenced its flight operations in 1985, is based in headquartered in Swords, Ireland. 
RYAAY is a #1 (Strong Buy) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B. 
It also boasts a Value Style Score of B thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 10.75; value 
investors should take notice. 
Four analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024, while the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate has increased $1.51 to $9.04 per share. RYAAY also boasts an average earnings surprise of 17.2%. 
With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, RYAAY should be on investors' short list. 
 Zacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock  
 It's only 1/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is 
still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom. 
 With strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for 
Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to 
explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028. See This Stock Now for Free  > >[1] Want the latest

Ryanair slams air traffic control over 'bogus' report on travel chaos

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) boss Michael O'Leary has slammed National Air Traffic Services (NATS) after 
the publication of its report into an issue which caused last week's travel chaos. 
Dubbing the report "bogus", O'Leary echoed calls from across the industry for NATS to take responsibility for the 
fault, which saw thousands of flights cancelled and around 300,000 people affected.
"You don't need a remit to do the right thing," he said in a video posted on X.
"NATS should be providing reimbursement of those costs to their airline customers that we're providing to our 
customers."

September 6, 2023
Questions still remain over the issue that caused Britain's air traffic control system to shut down, easyJet PLC boss 
Johan Lundgren said.
His warning comes in spite of the NATS report, which detailed that the system went into shutdown after receiving 
data it could not process.
"Many questions are still left unanswered," Lundgren commented, "an incident on this scale should not have 
happened and must not happen again".
Ryanair slams air traffic control over 'bogus' report on travel chaos
Industry body Airlines UK also called for airlines to receive compensation over the error, after carriers were said to 
have faced a near-£100 million hit from the chaos.
Airlines are obligated to accommodate or reroute passengers struck by flight cancellations, even if the cause of the 
issue is out of their hands.
"Airlines cannot be the insurer of a last resort," Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade commented.
NATS should be held accountable, he argued, adding: "We can't have a situation whereby airlines carry the can 
every time we see disruption of this magnitude." 
Regulator the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is poised to independently review NATS' response to the event, 
suggesting action could be taken if any licences were breached.

Brazil's Modern Logistics (WD) achieved a significant milestone with the delivery of its inaugural B737-800(BCF) on 
October 2, 2023. The cargo aircraft, bearing registration 2-BPDK (msn 33566), completed its journey from storage 
in Haikou, China, to Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, via stops in Doha, Malta, and Sal Amilcar Cabral International. 
The 19.2-year-old aircraft, previously operated by Ryanair in passenger configuration, is owned by BBAM and will 
be re-registered as PP-YBF in Brazil.
Modern Logistics plans to expand its fleet further with the arrival of its second B737-800(BCF) anticipated in the 
second quarter of 2024. The Brazilian cargo specialist is also exploring options to add two more aircraft in the 
future.
Currently, Modern Logistics operates a fleet consisting of two B737-300(F)s and one B737-400(SF), as indicated by 
data from the ch-aviation fleets advanced module. The addition of the B737-800(BCF) underscores Modern 
Logistics' commitment to enhancing its cargo capabilities and expanding its operations in the dynamic airfreight 
sector.

 Most hedge fund managers rake in millions of dollars every year, and many give back by donating large sums of 
money to charity on a regular basis, including through their own foundations. Archegos Capital founder Bill Hwang, 
who founded Tiger Asia Management and managed it until it was shut down in 2012, is one of those who uses their 
own foundation to dole out their fortunes. 
His legal problems and upcoming trial on fraud charges notwithstanding, we can get an idea about Hwang's favorite 
fund managers by reviewing his foundation's annual filing. According to the 990 for its 2021 fiscal year[1], which 
was filed in November 2022, The Grace and Mercy Foundation had $662 million in assets at the end of the year. 
Q2 2023 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[2] 
Capital Gains And Losses 
Of course, Hwang is a Tiger cub, meaning he learned the finer points of hedge fund management at Julian 
Robertson's Tiger Management. His foundation recorded capital gains and losses on several funds in fiscal 2021, 
including funds operated by several other Tiger cubs: 
Tiger Veda Global - Founded by fellow Tiger cub Manish Chopra, Tiger Veda announced plans to shut down in 
2015, citing the "needle-in-a-haystack process" that was making it difficult to find a new "value" long investment. 
Given that this fund planned to return all of its investor capital by early 2016, it's unclear why The Grace and Mercy 
Foundation listed its holdings in the fund as being sold in April 2021. Tiger Global - Founded by fellow Tiger cub 
Chase Coleman III, Tiger Global now stands in the midst of a major controversy over an alleged memo that the firm 
said came from a disgruntled former employee bent on spreading misinformation[3]. Aside from that bit of recent 
news, Tiger Global fell on hard times during the most recent crash in tech stocks, although it remains open, unlike 
many other Tiger-cub funds. Teng Yue Partners - This China-focused fund was founded by Tao Li in 2011 and 
focuses on public and private equity investments using fundamental analysis with a global perspective and local 
expertise. Teng Yue also targets companies outside China "where core research informs the investment ideas." 
Woodson Capital Partners - Woodson Capital Management is a Tiger seed fund, meaning Robertson's Tiger 
Management gave the firm some starting-out funds to get things going. Woodson generated triple-digit gains on its 
big bet on pandemic-era winner Peloton Interactive and then turned to homebuilding stocks in 2022. Currently, the 
firm's top holdings include Ryanair Holdings, Deckers Outdoor, Mister Car Wash, Suncor Energy and Callaway 
These Were Archegos Capital Founder Bill Hwang's Favorite Hedge Funds
Golf. Falcon Edge Global - Founded in 2012 by Rick Gerson, Ryan Khoury and Navroz Udwadia, Falcon Edge 
rebranded to Alpha Wave Global in late 2021. The Tiger "grandcub" firm invests across asset classes and counts 
some well-known names among its portfolio companies, including Elon Musk's SpaceX and The Boring Company, 
Alibaba and its fintech arm, Ant Group, and Asian ridesharing firm DiDi and its competitor Lyft. Alpha Wave's top 
holdings during the second quarter included PNM Resources, which accounted for over 20% of its portfolio, Amylyx 
Pharmaceuticals, BWX Technologies, NextGen Energy, and Mister Car Wash. Miura Global Partners - Founded by 
Francisco Alfaro and Richard Turnure in 2004, Miura Global is a Tiger seed fund that utilizes a long/ short equity 
strategy with a global focus. As of the second quarter, the firm's top holdings included put options in the Invesco 
QQQ Trust, which accounted for over 38% of its portfolio, Microsoft, Boston Scientific, Inmode and Arthur J. 
Gallagher. Totem Point Offshore Fund - Totem Point Management, another Tiger cub, launched its long/ short 
equity fund in 2013, followed by its long-only fund in 2018 and private investments in 2021. As of the second 
quarter, the firm's top holdings included Analog Devices, S&P Global, NVIDIA, MSCI and ON Semiconductor. Tiger 
Pacific Offshore Fund - Tiger Pacific Capital is managed by Run Ye, another Tiger cub, who founded it in 2012. The 
long/ short equity hedge fund follows a fundamental-driven equity selection approach utilizing bottom-up research. 
As of the second quarter, Tiger Pacific's top holdings included ZTO Express Cayman, TAL Education Group 
America, 360 DigiTech, KANZHUN and Pinduoduo. AlphaKeys - UBS sold its AlphaKeys Funds platform to iCapital 
in 2022[4]. It had about $7 billion in assets under management at the time. 
The Grace and Mercy Foundation also recorded capital gains and losses on currency exchanges from euros to U.S. 
dollars, and on equity swaps through Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse. 
Other Fund Holdings 
The foundation also listed additional holdings in these funds: 
Lone Cascade - Another Tiger cub, Lone Pine Capital utilizes a research-driven, fundamental-equity approach. As 
of the second quarter, the firm's top holdings included Microsoft, Taiwan Semiconductor, Amazon, Bath & Body 
Works, and RH. KKR Global Impact Fund - As the fund's name suggests, this is an impact fund operated by KKR 
(Kohlberg Kravis Roberts). The private equity fund targets companies that deliver impact through their products or 
services while actively managing ESG-related risks. KKR particularly looks for companies that address global 
challenges based on the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. The KKR Global Impact Fund focuses on 
the lower-middle PE market, with a particular emphasis on climate action, inclusive growth, sustainable living and 
lifelong learning. Tiger Global Private Investment Partners XI - This is a venture-capital fund managed by 
Coleman's Tiger Global that invests in the U.S., China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and India. Further Global Capital 
Partners A - Further Global Capital Management invests in the financial services industry providing "creative, 
bespoke solutions" within its target universe. The firm targets equity investments of $75 million to $200 million, 
although it can execute significantly larger co-investment transactions. Further Global usually seeks controlling 
interests, although it is also comfortable operating as a minority owner in certain situations. Ascend Capital Partners 
Co-Invest (Blocker) - This firm describes itself as "business starters and operators who have worked across Eastern 
and Western cultures." Ascend Capital seeks early-stage disruptive tech companies with commercial potential in 
the U.S., Europe and China, especially those that complement its existing portfolio to create "holistic solutions." The 
firm especially focuses on the medtech and mobility industries.

RYANAIR flew a record number of passengers for the fourth month in a row in August, despite reporting 350 
cancellations due to the recent air traffic control scandal.
The low-cost carrier said it had carried 18.9m passengers in August, up 11 per cent year-on-year and representing 
an increase from a July record of 18.7m.
The figures provide a fitting end to one of the busiest summer seasons of travel, with budget rival Wizz Air also 
reporting a 23.9 per cent year-on-year increase in passengers, with over 6m flying with Wizz Air in August.
Load factor, which refers to the proportion of seats filled by its passengers, also remained strong for both airlines - 
at 96 per cent and 94.1 per cent for Ryanair and Wizz Air respectively.
However, the bumper summer period has also marred by disruption, with air traffic control chaos in the UK and 
France, as well as wildfires in Southern Europe, forcing carriers to cancel thousands of flights.
Ryanair yesterday said the air traffic control failure in the UK had resulted in the cancellation of over 350 flights over 
the two following days, affecting 63,000 passengers and questioned why the cause had "still not been explained".
Additionally, it said it had been forced to cancel over 1,700 flights due to industrial action in France.

£ Ryanair carried over 18.9m passengers in August, a new record high, up 11 per cent versus a year ago. It 
operated 103 thousand flights during the month with over 350 flights cancelled due to the air traffic control computer 
failure issues over August bank holiday weekend. Shares in Ryanair have rallied sharply this year, driven by robust 
post-Covid demand for summer holiday travel and a jump in prices. However the winter could be more challenging 
as the cost of living weighs on consumer spending.

easyJet leads grilling of air traffic control after week of chaos
easyJet leads grilling of air traffic control after week of chaos

easyJet PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) have asked questions of Britain's air traffic control systems 
after an hours-long failure last week sent the industry into chaos.
Airlines have effectively been left in the dark following the failure, which affected around 300,000 people and 
caused the cancellations of several thousand flights, the budget duo said.
"An incident of this scale should not have happened and must not happen again in the future," easyJet boss Johan 
Lundgren commented.
Ryanair said the failure "has still not been explained" meanwhile, as the Irish carrier revealed some 63,000 of its 
passengers were affected and 350 flights cancelled as a result.
According to National Air Traffic Services (NATS), its entire system went into shutdown on Monday for several 
hours due to some incorrect incoming data.
This left air traffic controllers having to manually input flight data, leading to a restriction being placed on the number 
of in and outgoing UK flights that could be handled.
Lundgren argued that "passengers deserve to see a full independent review" of the event, with this already 
promised to regulator the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) by NATS last week.
easyJet leads grilling of air traffic control after week of chaos
"[This should] not only result in meaningful improvements to prevent an incident of this scale happening again but 
also consider a wide range of issues beyond this incident," Lundgren said, "including staffing levels required at 
NATS to deliver today's flying and what modernisation is needed."
Over a quarter of Britain's flights are estimated to have been cancelled last Monday due to the fault, with thousands 
more delayed and issues continuing late into the week.
Most chaos-hit passengers had reached their final destinated come Saturday, according to transport secretary Mark 
Harper, with the review having been expected on Sunday.
How did it happen?
NATS first publicly notified that it was experiencing an issue at 12:10 British summer time (BST) on Monday 
afternoon.
"We are currently experiencing a technical issue and have applied traffic flow restrictions to maintain safety. 
Engineers are working to find and fix the fault," NATS reported initially.
Issues then continued into the afternoon, with another blog post at 12:40 BST reassuring that the air traffic 
controller was still working "hard to resolve the technical issue".
"To clarify, UK airspace is not closed, we have had to apply air traffic flow restrictions which ensures we can 
maintain safety," NATS then added.
An update at 14:20 then confirmed air traffic controllers had taken to manually inputting flight data, prompting the 
traffic restrictions given the more painstaking process.
Airlines such as easyJet, Ryanair and British Airways then warned of "severe" disruption, acknowledging flights 
would have to be cancelled.
At 15:15, just over three hours after the issue was first reported, NATS updated that the fault had been "identified 
and remedied".
Though seemingly just hours long, the fault had already ensured disruption for thousands of flights and the 
hundreds of passengers due to travel on each flight.
Given its severity, the industry has since called for answers to show such an issue could happen and who should 
bear the costs, with this tipped by the International Air Transport Association to be much as £100 million for the 
airlines affected.

Airlines' ancillary costs face scrutiny in government consultation
Airlines' ancillary costs face scrutiny in government consultation

Airlines' practice of hitting passengers with add-ons at the booking stage is facing public scrutiny through a 
government consultation.
Government research found that ancillary costs across a range of industries, including extra charges for specific 
seats or additional bags on flights, cost consumers £1.6 billion a year.
Given costs are often not advertised in the original price of flights, making them look cheaper at first glance, the 
consultation will seek ways to clamp down on the practice.
The Department for Business and Trade consultation will last six weeks from Monday, covering a range of 
industries, including the aviation sector.
"Fake reviews and hidden fees can make choices increasingly confusing and leaves customers unsure about what 
product is right for them," business minister Kevin Hollinrake commented.
Airlines generated some £81 billion through ancillary costs last year, in stark contrast with the £31 billion made 
through such add-ons in 2013.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) and easyJet PLC are among those to score significant proportions of revenue 
through these costs, with both seeing marked increases in their latest respective quarters.
Ancillary sales generated a total of (EURO)1.18 billion (£1.01 billion) for the Irish carrier during the first quarter-up 
15%-of total revenue worth (EURO)3.65 billion.
Airlines' ancillary costs face scrutiny in government consultation
easyJet marked a 28% increase in ancillary revenue in its latest quarterly results meanwhile, to £622 million, as 
passenger revenue climbed to £1.5 billion.
Per average passenger, Ryanair made (EURO)23.30 in ancillary revenue in the three months to June, while 
easyJet gained £23.75.
Though the costs range from priority boarding to food and drink on flights, reports have slated airlines for charging 
hefty prices for services such as printing ticket at airports.
The industry backed keeping such costs separate to ticket prices, arguing it allowed for better deals.
"Delivering value for consumers is at the heart of an airline business, with the competitiveness of the industry 
meaning it already delivers excellent choice, service and value to consumers," trade group Airlines UK commented.

Body
Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) has revealed around 63,000 of its passengers had their flights cancelled due to 
last week's air traffic control failure.
This disruption, which left thousands stranded overseas, was caused by an issue with the National Air Traffic 
Services (Nats) processing flight plans automatically.
Despite these setbacks, the Irish carrier announced a record-breaking 11% increase in passengers for August 
compared to the same month last year. The airline transported 18.9 million passengers, surpassing its previous 
record set in July.
Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, criticised Nats for the disruption, describing it as "unacceptable" and 
demanding an explanation for the failure.
The disruption came at a particularly challenging time for the airline industry, with the end of the summer break for 
many schools leaving little spare capacity across the sector.
The shares, traded in Dublin, were up around 1% early on.

Highlight: The positive after-effects from Friday’s US jobs figures linger with the FTSE 100 continuing to rally on 
hopes of an end to interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
Body
The FTSE 100 has jumped another 0.7% on excitement that last Friday’s US jobs figures could mean an end to 
interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.  
The UK blue-chip index gained 56 points to 7,520, extending a two-week rally that has seen the benchmark 
advance 3.6%, nearly eliminating its losses for the year which in capital terms stand at 0.4%. 
Susannah Streeter, head of markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said markets enjoyed a ‘dose of Monday motivation, 
as investors assess the slightly sunnier prospects for the world economy’. 
‘Hopes have lifted that the US Federal Reserve’s efforts in taming unruly inflation in the US are working and not 
much more interest rate stick will be needed,’ Streeter said. 
‘There is also relief that Chinese efforts in stimulating demand might finally be paying off.’ 
Job numbers from the US on Friday showed the tightness in the jobs market was easing and the US is still 
considered resilient enough to avoid a recession. There is now an expectation that rates will be kept on hold at the 
upcoming Fed meeting and may now be unchanged for the rest of the year. 
Oil prices rose thanks to more upbeat manufacturing in China and the expectations of a continued squeeze in 
supply from Opec countries. Brent crude is now hovering around $88 a barrel. 
Glencore (GLEN) jumped to the top of the index, up 1.9%, or 8p, at 435p, followed by: 
•
Rio Tinto (RIO) up 1.6%, or 80p, at £50.55.
•
Anglo American (AAL) up 1.4%, or 30p, at £21.66.
•
BP (BP) up 1.1%, or 5p, at 506p.
•
Weir (WEIR) up 1%, or 18p, at £18.60.
Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said China-sensitive stocks like Glencore, Rio Tinto, 
and Anglo American also benefited from overnight gains in Asia that saw Hong Kong’s Hang Seng leap 2.5%. 
FTSE climbs on US cheer, up 3.6% in two-week rally
‘The Hang Seng rallied sharply after China reduced borrowing requirements for homebuyers in a bid to shore up its 
embattled real estate sector,’ Scholar said. 
‘Chinese property developer Country Garden shares surged after its creditors agreed to restructure some of its 
overdue debts, helping the business to avoid a default.’ 
In London, travel stocks rose as mid-cap Wizz Air (WIZZ) and Ryanair (RYA) reported passenger increases in 
August. The budget airline carrier flew 18.9m passengers, up from July’s record of 18.7m and 11% more than in 
August 2022. 
FTSE constituent and British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines (IAG) gained 1.7%, or 2p, to 
162p. 
The FTSE 250 put on 0.4%, or 74 points, to 18,610, taking its advance since 21 August to 3.8%. Year to date, 
excluding dividends from companies, the index is still down 2.7% in price terms. 
Wizz Air added 2.1%, or 28p, at £22.48, with package holiday operator Tui (TUI) up 1.7%, or 8p, at 461p, while 
Easyjet (EZJ) added 1.7%, or 7p, to trade at 432p. 
BlackRock World Mining (BRWM ) investment trust rose 2.2%, or 13p, to 605p on the optimism for commodities 
consumption.

Sep 04, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported highly impressive traffic numbers for the month of August, driven by upbeat 
air travel demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in August was 18.9 million, implying that 
12% more passengers flew than a year ago. 
Owing to upbeat traffic, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was as high as 96% in August. 
This, however, remained flat from its year-ago figure. 
Owing to buoyant air travel demand, shares of Ryanair have gained 34.7% over the past year compared with the 
12.1% growth of the Zacks Airline [2]industry. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Ryanair has been benefiting from a stronger-than-expected recovery in air travel demand from the pandemic lows. 
While passenger volumes continue to be strong, what is all the more encouraging is the strong bounce back of 
international travel. 
Ryanair expects its traffic for fiscal 2024 to be 183.5 million. In spite of upbeat passenger volumes, RYAAY 
continues to be hurt due to headwinds like air traffic control strikes and further probable Boeing delivery delays. Due 
to the challenges, management trimmed its fiscal 2024 traffic forecast from 185 million. Zacks Rank & Key Picks 
Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation[3] sector are GATX Corporation 
GATX[4] and Triton International Limited TRTN[5]. 
GATX, which presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has strengthened its railcar leasing operations. You can see 
the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6]. 
For third-quarter and full-year 2023, GATX's earnings are expected to register 36.6% and 14.3% growth, 
respectively, on a year-over-year basis. 
Triton, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, is benefiting from its consistent efforts to reward shareholders 
through dividends and share repurchases. 
Triton has an impressive liquidity position. Its current ratio (a measure of liquidity) was 3.83 at the end of second-
quarter 2023. A current ratio of more than 1 often indicates that the company will be easily paying off its short-term 
obligations.

Ryanair Group faces 737 Max delivery delays
Ryanair Group faces 737 Max delivery delays

Ryanair has said ongoing production delays will leave the company 13 Boeing 737 Max aircraft deliveries short of 
the expected 27 aircraft expected ahead of this year's winter season.
The delays, which may extend into 2024, will push the company to cut winter capacity across Europe as it has no 
spare aircraft due to scheduled maintenance necessary across the fleet to be ready for summer 2024.
Ryanair said it is working with Boeing to try to accelerate deliveries so that it can enter the summer 2024 period with 
all 57 new Boeing aircraft deliveries as expected by May 2024.
"We are working closely with Boeing and their supplier, Spirit, to minimise these delivery delays. It is deeply 
regrettable that production problems in Wichita, and in Seattle, have yet again delayed Boeing's contracted 
deliveries to Ryanair this winter," commented Ryanair Group chief executive officer Michael O'Leary.
"We are in regular dialogue with Boeing, and our primary objective is to ensure we get delivery of all 57 contracted 
B737 aircraft before the end of May 2024, so that Ryanair's fleet can grow to over 600 aircraft for what will be our 
largest ever summer flight programme."
Ryanair said these delivery delays will not impact its full-year traffic guidance of 183.5 million passengers, however 
if the delays worsen or extend further into the first quarter, it may have to adjust "slightly downward".

Boeing registered 35 deliveries in August, down from 43 units in July, and the same number as in August last year.
It was also the slowest delivery month for Boeing since April, according to the data.
Year-to-date deliveries for the US manufacturer now stand at 344 aircraft, including 271 Boeing 737 Max aircraft.
The 737 Max made up 22 of last month's deliveries, with seven units for Southwest Airlines, five for United Airlines, 
two for American Airlines and one each for Gol Linhas Aereas, Ryanair and Alaska Airlines.
Five 787 family aircraft were delivered, including a 787-8 for Japan Airlines.
Boeing also delivered three 777 freighters, two for Fedex and one unit going to China Airlines.
Lessors accounted for only four direct deliveries last month, with three 737 Max aircraft handed over to Aercap and 
one to BOC Aviation.
However, August's order activity was dominated by lessors, with Aviation Capital Group and SMBC Aviation Capital 
making up all 38 of the total 737 Max orders placed last month.
The SMBC AC order was confirmed this week, bringing lessor 737 Max orders to 1,300 units.
Another seven 787-family aircraft were ordered by undisclosed customers, bring gross orders to 45 units in August.
Boeing's 737 Max unfilled order list consists of 2,776 737 Max 8s, 336 737 Max 8-200s and 131 737 Max 9s, with 
297 and 813 yet-to-enter service 737 Max 7s and 10s respectively.

Airlines losing millions as fingers pointed over air traffic control chaos
Airlines losing millions as fingers pointed over air traffic control chaos

Monday's air traffic control system failure will likely be costing airlines millions of pounds, industry members have 
warned, as focus turns to the causes of the chaos.
After some 1,500 flights faced cancellations on Monday on the back of the National Air Traffic Services (Nats) 
system failure, carriers have faced pressure to act swiftly in helping the roughly 300,000 passengers affected.
Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) and easyJet PLC have since launched repatriation flights to rescue those strewn 
across Europe for instance, though two days after the issue, disruption continues.
 While there is still some disruption due to Monday's air traffic restrictions, most passengers will be able to travel as 
planned through Heathrow today. Passengers are reminded to check with their airline for the latest info about their 
flight. - Heathrow Airport (@HeathrowAirport) August 30, 2023
International Air Transport Association director general Willie Walsh warned on Wednesday that airlines have likely 
faced huge financial hits meanwhile, as questions build over how such a failure could happen.
"We're looking at costs in the tens of millions probably at this stage," he said on BBC Radio.
"[It's] too early to estimate fully, but I would imagine at an industry level we'll be getting close to £100 million of 
additional costs that airlines have encountered as a result."
Walsh also argued that Nats should be made to pay for the disruption, which ultimately saw air traffic controllers 
resort to inputting flight data manually for several hours on Monday.
Airlines losing millions as fingers pointed over air traffic control chaos
"The people responsible for the cancellations should bear the costs [...] this is a failure that shouldn't have 
happened," he added.
Consumer group Which? explained it was indeed the airlines that are responsible for ensuring passengers are kept 
up to date and accommodated if their flights are cancelled though.
"Airlines have a duty of care to passengers and are required to provide food and drink after two to three hours of 
delay," the consumer group said.
However, whether passengers are granted compensation is another matter, it warned.
"The air traffic control failure took place on 28 August," the group continued.
"Any disruption on that day and the following days will be classed as extraordinary circumstances, which means no 
compensation is due.
"However, if your flight several days or a week later is cancelled or delayed and the airline claims it's a result of the 
air traffic control system failure, you may be due compensation."
A report on the system failure is due from Nats to the UK regulator the Civil Aviation Authority "in the coming days", 
according to transport secretary Mark Harper.
Given speculation that it was incorrect information from a French airline that sent the system into shutdown and firm 
denial that the issue was caused by a cyberattack, the true cause remains to be seen.

"Airlines are clear about their responsibilities to passengers and are working with the rest of the industry to safely 
get them to their destinations," Harper added.
"The aviation minister Charlotte Vere and I are being kept up to date on the latest developments and will be 
reviewing the interim report from NATS."

Flight chaos CAA to probe air traffic control failure
Flight chaos CAA to probe air traffic control failure

The aviation regulator is preparing to launch an investigation into the collapse of the air traffic control system at the 
end of a busy bank holiday weekend, as delays continued with around 300 flights cancelled yesterday.
The Civil Aviation Authority is in talks with the government about the scope of an inquiry into the failure at National 
Air Traffic Services on Monday, a person familiar with the discussions said.
More than a quarter of flights in and out of the UK were cancelled on Monday, and many more were delayed as a 
result of the failure.
Transport secretary Mark Harper said yesterday that the CAA would have to take "an independent look" given the 
scale of the problem. "A report will then come to me and we will look at that to see if there are lessons to be learned 
about reducing the risk of it happening again," he told ITV's Good Morning Britain.
The failure, which Nats blamed on a "technical issue", grounded hundreds of flights on one of the busiest days of 
the year as air traffic controllers had to input flight plans manually. Nats said yesterday it had launched a "thorough 
investigation", which it would share with the CAA and the government.
Harper said his priority was to make sure passengers "get where they need to be as quickly as possible". The 
government was ready to provide "further appropriate support" to airlines if required. Nats said its systems were 
"operating as normal" but airlines and airports were dealing with a backlog of passengers, leading to some 
cancellations.
Flight chaos CAA to probe air traffic control failure
Cirium, an aviation analytics group, said that based on early estimates about 5 per cent of flights had been 
cancelled, affecting 147 departures and 134 arrivals.
Despite the widespread disruption, passengers are unlikely to be able to claim compensation from airlines as the 
rules exempt "extraordinary circumstances", such as air traffic control system failures.
British Airways said it was still experiencing "knock-on effects". EasyJet said "some flights ... were, unfortunately, 
unable to operate".
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, said it was "not acceptable" that Nats had allowed its "computer 
systems to be taken down and everybody's flights get cancelled".
Willy Walsh, head of the International Air Transport Association, which represents the big airlines worldwide, 
criticised the CAA. "The failure of this essential service is unacceptable and brings into question the oversight of the 
CAA who are required to review the Nats resilience plan under the terms of its licence," he said.
"Airlines will bear significant sums in care and assistance charges, on top of the costs of disruption
But it will cost Nats nothing." Sylvia Pfeifer, Leke Oso Alabi and Jim Pickard

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary said the UK's National Air Traffic Service, or NATS, 
should not have allowed their computer systems to be taken down in light of the technical disruption that caused 
hundreds of flight cancellations on Monday.
O'Leary said they are yet to receive an explanation from the air traffic controller regarding the cause and the 
absence of backup systems amid the disruption, City A.M. reported Tuesday.
On Monday, the Irish ultra-low-cost carrier canceled 250 flights and another 70 on Tuesday. 
Ryanair rose marginally when Tuesday's trading closed.

Hyatt Faces Class Action Over Resort Fees. Late last week, consumer advocacy group, Travelers United, filed a 
class action in Washington D.C. superior court over Hyatt's alleged resort or destination fee practices. This lawsuit

France calls for minimum price on European flights

France's transport minister called Wednesday for a minimum price for plane flights in Europe to battle climate 
change.
Transport Minister Clement Beaune said in an interview with the weekly L'Obs that he would submit such a 
proposal to his EU counterparts in the coming days.
"Plane tickets for 10 euros when we're in the midst of the ecological transition, that's no longer possible," Beaune 
told the magazine.
"That doesn't reflect the price for the planet," he added.
Low-cost airlines made major inroads in Europe by offering rock-bottom fares on some routes, with Ryanair 
becoming the region's largest airline.
But the low fares sometimes don't cover costs, and flying emits more greenhouse gases than travelling by train.
"I openly call for taxing polluting activities to invest in the ecological transition," said Beaune, adding that the 
government plans to increase the tax on flights departing France to fund rail investments.
Increased levies on companies managing France's highways and on airline tickets are likely figure in the 2024 
budget due to be unveiled at the end of September.
Low-cost airlines have also been a source of controversy in France over their wages and labour practices.

 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - August 30, 2023 - Stocks in this week's article are Medpace Holdings, Inc. 
MEDP[1], Invitation Home Inc. INVH[2] and Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[3]. 3 Top Stocks Exhibiting Superb 
Earnings Growth Earnings growth is the main priority for any organization. This is because if the company doesn't 
make money, it won't last sooner or later. 
So, what's earnings growth? Study a company's revenues over a given period, subtract the production cost, and 
you have earnings. Incidentally, this is also considered the most important variable manipulating the share price. 
But, expectations of earnings play a significant role. Earnings Estimates & Share Price Movements Frequently, we 
have seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in price following an earnings decline. 
This is largely the result of a company's earnings failing to meet market expectations. 
Earnings estimates embody analysts' opinions on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive 
industry environment, profit margins, and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool, while 
making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair 
value of a firm. 
Thus, investors should be on the lookout for stocks ready to make a big move. Hence, investors need to buy stocks 
with historical earnings growth and are seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates. 
The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,839 stocks to only six. Here are the top three stocks 
that stand out: 
Medpace Holdings, Inc. is a scientifically driven, global, full-service clinical contract research organization. Medpace 
has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). MEDP's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 15.3%. You can 
see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[4]. 
Invitation Home Inc. provides real estate services. It focuses on owning, renovating, leasing and operating single-
family residential properties. Invitation Home has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). INVH's expected earnings growth rate for 
the current year is 7.2%. 
Ryanair Holdings plc provides scheduled passenger airline services. Ryanair has a Zacks Rank #1. RYAAY's 
expected earnings growth rate for the current year is almost 25%.

Disruption to flights in and out of the UK is set to last for days following an air traffic control technical fault on 
Monday.
After more than 1,500 flights were cancelled on Monday, transport secretary Mark Harper warned on BBC Radio 4 
that further disruption was expected.
"It is going to take some days to get completely everybody back to where they should be," he said.
"Airlines have a responsibility either to get people back on a flight to get them home or to pay for them to be 
accommodated and to sort out accommodation of them, and for food or drink as well."
A flight planning system technical fault saw National Air Traffic Services (Nats) forced to turn to manual operations 
on Monday, prompting delays and cancellations to flights to and from the UK.
Though Nats said the issue had been identified and fixed by Monday afternoon, several hours of controllers having 
to input flight data manually saw the likes of British Airways, easyJet, Tui and Ryanair all cancel flights.
"We are continuing to experience the knock-on effects of yesterday's Nats air traffic control issue, which includes 
unavoidable delays and cancellations," BA said on Tuesday.
Heathrow, which experienced the highest number of cancellations, also warned of further delays on Tuesday.

Flight chaos to last for days after UK air traffic control fault
"Schedules continue to be affected by yesterday's restrictions on UK airspace," an airport spokesperson 
commented.
"While the majority of passengers will still be able to travel, there will unfortunately be some disruption on some 
routes, including flight cancellations."

Some 300 flights have been cancelled on Tuesday, following the grounding of thousands on Monday due to an air 
traffic control fault, prompting criticism of airlines.
Though the National Air Traffic Services (Nats) failure, which forced controllers to turn to manually inputting flight 
data, was said to be fixed on Monday afternoon, disruption has continued.
Some 75 flights are said to have been cancelled at Gatwick, with 74 axed at Heathrow, alongside further flights at 
the likes of Manchester, Stansted, Luton and Edinburgh.
The cancellations are likely to have hit over 300,000 people, prompting huge pressure on airlines to accommodate 
and feed those affected.
Airlines should be "proactively" communicating with passengers and take "every possible step" to address the 
disruption, Downing Street said on Tuesday.
Individual accounts have suggested some stranded passengers have been offered little information about 
alternative flights as the chaos continues though.
Portia Oduba slated easyJet on Instagram after becoming stranded in Greece with her husband - television 
presenter Ore Oduba - and their children.
"easyJet have cancelled all flights leaving till Sunday," she said before the family booked an alternative flight

"But it's ok. They've offered us a voucher for the next time we fly. Maybe we can fly home on that, magic carpet 
style."
A spokesperson for prime minister Rishi Sunak reiterated that it seemed to be a technical fault that had affected the 
Nats system and not a cyber-attack.
Rumours have also circulated that an inputting error by a French airline could have sparked the system failure.
"There's going to be an investigation by the Civil Aviation Authority and a report shared with government [...] in 
days," the spokesperson added.
"It's not acceptable that UK Nats simply allow their computer systems to be taken down, and everybody's flights get 
cancelled or delayed," Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said in a video posted on social media.

Ryanair has announced the upcoming launch of a new two-aircraft base in Copenhagen in December 2023. The 
new base will create up to 100 jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers as part of a US$200m new aircraft 
investment.
The Copenhagen base will be the second Ryanair base operating in Denmark, joining the airline's two-aircraft base 
in Billund, central Denmark.
"Ryanair is pleased to announce this two-aircraft base in Copenhagen from Dec, which will compliment our two-
aircraft base in Billund," said Michael O'Leary, CEO of Ryanair. "This represents a further $200m investment by 
Ryanair in the recovery of air traffic and tourism in Copenhagen, which continues to lag behind its pre-Covid 
volumes. Ryanair believes this is because the high airport fees and the high fares being charged by NAS and SAS, 
which hampers recovery of Danish traffic and tourism."
Ryanair expects to carry 184 million passengers in 2023/2024, up by 24% from pre-Covid traffic figures, which saw 
149 million passengers. The addition of the new base will offer passengers flying from Copenhagen low fares and 
more choice for early morning departures and late evening arrivals in Copenhagen.
"Ryanair's new Copenhagen base will build on our existing 20 routes, which we operate to/from Copenhagen on 
aircraft based outside Denmark," added O'Leary. "Today's announcement means that from Dec, these low fares will 
now extend to early morning departures and late evening arrivals and will provide much-needed choice and low fare 
competition to Denmark's State-aided, high-fare airlines SAS and NAS."

Britain's government on Tuesday ordered a review after the country's air traffic control system suffered its worst 
disruption in almost 10 years, stranding thousands of passengers.
Flights departing and arriving in the UK continued to be cancelled, one day after air traffic control systems were 
temporarily hit by a technical fault.
Transport Secretary Mark Harper said there would be an independent review into the worst incident of its kind for 
"nearly a decade" that is expected to last well into the week.
"This was a technical fault. We do not think this was a cybersecurity incident," he told GB News.
The last Monday of August -- a public holiday in England, Wales and Northern Ireland -- traditionally sees large 
numbers of passengers returning from summer vacations.
"I know people will be enormously frustrated by the disruption that's impacting them," Prime Minister Rishi Sunak 
told British broadcasters.
"Thankfully things like this are rare and the issue itself was fixed in a matter of hours, but the disruption obviously is 
continuing and will last for a little while longer."
The National Air Traffic Services (NATS) said it "identified and remedied" a technical issue which forced it to impose 
traffic flow restrictions.
NATS said the issue meant flight plans had to be processed manually, while it indicated to AFP that hundreds of 
flights had been affected and that it would take "several days" for the situation to return to normal.
London's main airports were the worst hit, with Heathrow and Gatwick cancelling dozens of flights Tuesday.
British Airways was the worst affected airline.
UK Orders Review Into Air Traffic Control Chaos
Aviation analytics company Cirium said 790 departures and 785 arrivals were cancelled across all UK airports on 
Monday.
That was equivalent to just over one quarter of planned flights, dealing a blow to the sector following its recent 
strong recovery from the Covid shutdown.
The boss of Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, said the no-frills carrier had to cancel about 250 flights, affecting some 
40,000 passengers.
"Last night (Monday) we had 20 aircraft that couldn't get back to their home bases so they're out of place for today," 
he said from Dublin.
"Today, unfortunately, it looks like we're going to cancel about another 70 flights," he added, hoping that the 
situation would return to normal by Wednesday.
At Heathrow, passengers voiced frustration at the delays, which also saw planes diverted, adding hours to journey 
times.
George McHugh returned from a weekend wedding in Spain on Tuesday morning but his friends were still stuck in 
Madrid after being due to fly back on Monday.
"Once they got to the airport it was absolute chaos, everything was cancelled," he told AFP. "So we were stuck up 
in hotels and things like that.
"I'm probably just lucky that I got there this morning instead of yesterday when it all happened," he added.
On social media, angry passengers said airlines could have done better in providing support and communicating 
with passengers.
Rory Boland, travel editor at consumer advice publication Which?, said carriers were obliged to offer "timely 
rerouting" or provide overnight accommodation.

(Alliance News) - The UK government on Tuesday ordered a review after the country's air traffic control system

Thousands of airline passengers faced long delays and flight cancellations at the end of the busy summer bank 
holiday weekend after a failure in the UK's air traffic control system yesterday grounded hundreds of aircraft.
National Air Traffic Services said it had identified and remedied a "technical issue" that had hit its capacity to 
process flight plans automatically, but the knock-on effects were set to cause continued disruption to services as 
airlines and airports scrambled to reorganise flights this week.
The problem severely restricted the number of aircraft allowed to land and take off as Nats was forced to input flight 
plans manually during the outage.
The chaos came on one of the busiest days of the year, with holidaymakers returning on the final day of the bank 
holiday weekend, days before the new school year begins.
Thousands of delayed passengers were faced with hours stuck in crowded departure halls, including families with 
children unable to return home, some having to rebook for another day. Others were trapped on planes on the 
tarmac awaiting further information on whether their flights would take off.
The delays unleashed a torrent of frustrated posts on social media from stranded travellers.
Travellers braced for more delays after air traffic fault brings holiday turmoil; Systems failure grounds planes 
Knock-on effect from flight disruption Carriers....
Chris McLaughlin, the former cochair of the UK Spaceflight Safety and Regulatory Council, wrote: "Bank Holiday 
Monday and where better to be than the BA Lounge at Heathrow. Air Traffic Failure over UK and my flight pushed 
to late afternoon - maybe."
John Strickland, an aviation analyst, said "hundreds of thousands" of passengers were affected. He said that the 
disruption was likely to spill into the next few days as airlines rearranged their planes and flight crews.
"It's an enormous problem, given the complexity on what should be a gold mine period for UK airlines," he added, 
warning of the financial impact on airlines of having to rebook passengers and reorganise schedules.
British Airways said it had been "severely disrupted" and warned that it would have to make "significant changes" to 
its schedule. It said passengers on short-haul services should check the status of their flights.
Ryanair warned that the problems were affecting "all airlines operating to and from the UK today" and said it would 
be forced to delay or cancel "a number of flights" as a result.
The system failure was one of the worst problems to hit Nats in recent years, which have included computer 
glitches and radar display problems. Nats said it would work closely with airlines and airports to manage the flights 
as efficiently as possible. "Our engineers will be carefully monitoring the system's performance as we return to 
normal operations," it added.
While the system failure affected all flights into and out of British airports, Nats said, UK airspace had remained 
open throughout.
Data provider Cirium said 232 flights had been cancelled departing UK airports as of yesterday afternoon, 
equivalent to around 8 per cent of all departures. It said that it had identified 271 arriving flights that had also been 
cancelled. But it warned there were many more aircraft that had been delayed.
Eurocontrol, the organisation that oversees air traffic management for Europe, said the failure related to the UK's 
"flight data processing system".

Highlight: Airlines and airports from across the UK have been seeking to calm passengers and the wider aviation 
industry after a technical issue hit the country's air traffic control systems over a bank holiday this week.
Body
While the issue has been resolved by NATS and flights should be returning to normal levels, many passengers are 
likely to continue experiencing delays and cancellations as airlines attempt to bring their staff and aircraft back in 
line with schedules.  A spokesperson for Heathrow Airport said: "Schedules continue to be affected by yesterday's 
restrictions on UK airspace. While the majority of passengers will still be able to travel, there will unfortunately be 
some disruption on some routes, including flight cancellations." Manchester Airport also echoed similar sentiments 
and said: "There is obviously a backlog from yesterday to work through. 
Were it not for that, it would be business as usual, but because of that, it's obviously going to be a very busy day for 
our airlines and we expect there to be some delays and cancellations."  Gatwick, Edinburgh and Belfast 
International Airports also said that they were planning on running to a normal schedule but that passengers should 
still check with their airlines about possible changes to their flights.  On the airline side, Ryanair said it was trying to 
get its operations back on schedule after over 20 aircraft could not return to their home bases and expected some 
continued disruption as a result.  The airline's CEO Michael O'Leary also released a video statement to say that 
Ryanair had had to cancel about 250 flights due to the traffic restrictions on Monday, affecting 40,000 passengers 
and would be cancelling another 70 on August 29. He said that the airline was hoping to be running as normal by 
August 30, adding: "We're looking to run a couple of additional flights today, rescue flights, but it's very difficult 
because we're tight on crews, we're also tight on aircraft." The outspoken CEO also criticised NATS for not telling 
the airline what had happened and for not having backup systems, saying: "It's not acceptable that UK NATS simply 
allow their computer systems to be taken down and everybody's flights get cancelled or delayed."

%5Etweet Jet2.com also said that it would be adding extra flights to its schedule but expected more delays, with an 
update from the airline saying: "We would of course like to apologise to everyone that is affected by this situation, 
which is unfortunately completely outside of our control and await the outcome of the CAA National Air Traffic 
Services investigation into what happened."  British Airways expressed similar concerns about continuing knock-on

effects but clarified that it is offering customers on short-haul services the opportunity to move flights to a later date 
for free. Meanwhile, Virgin Atlantic did not experience mass cancellations; the airline said that its VS231 and VS232 
flights from Heathrow to Austin and back were cancelled but had experienced delays and said more were still likely.

Interest in artificial intelligence (AI) has soared since the debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT last November. The platform 
forced the public to rethink what is currently possible with AI and has attracted countless companies to the market. 
As a result, AI stocks have been on the rise this year, boosting the market into recovery mode after last year's sell-
off.
Despite the rally, it's not too late to invest in the high-growth sector and profit from the long-term development of AI. 
Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are two attractive options. One has the advantage of 
being the world's biggest cloud company, while the other holds a majority market share in AI chips.
So, let's examine whether Amazon or Nvidia is the better stock to back the $137 billion AI market.
Amazon
Amazon shares have risen 58% since Jan. 1, rallying investors with increasing potential in AI . The company 
appeared to start the year at a disadvantage as its biggest competitor, Microsoft, acquired exclusive licenses on 
some of OpenAI's most powerful AI models. However, in recent months, Amazon has used its vast resources to 
invest heavily in the industry and has shown it shouldn't be underestimated.
The tech giant is using its leading cloud market share to its advantage by swiftly expanding Amazon Web Services 
(AWS). In June, the company unveiled several new AI-enabled services to AWS. Bedrock uses a language model 
similar to ChatGPT to help clients build chatbots and image generators. Meanwhile, CodeWhisperer and 
HealthScribe are tools geared toward web developers and healthcare providers.
According to Reuters, the new AI offerings are attracting thousands of customers, with Sony and Ryanair reportedly 
testing Bedrock.
Moreover, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy revealed last month that the company has developed two AI chips it calls 
Inferentia and Trainium. Amazon has promised to offer the best price-to-performance in the market, which could 
give chipmakers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices a run for their money over the long term.
Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Amazon vs. Nvidia
Nvidia
Nvidia has become a star amid the AI boom, snapping up about 90% of the market share in chips. Its stock has 
risen 214% year to date as bullish investors have rushed to back the company's potential in the lucrative market.
Investor excitement hasn't been unfounded, as proven by the glowing second-quarter 2024 (July 2023) earnings 
results. The quarter saw Nvidia revenue rise 101% year over year, beating analysts' expectations by over $2 billion. 
A rise in AI chip demand was the main driver of growth, with the company projecting an even larger revenue 
increase in its current quarter as it overcomes supply strains quicker than expected.
Nvidia's data center business has exploded thanks to AI, with the company's years of dominance in graphics 
processing units (GPU) perfectly positioning it to rule the market. The company could face challenges over the long 
term as the competition catches up. But until then, Nvidia's command of the sector makes its stock a compelling 
option.
Is Amazon or Nvidia the better stock to invest in AI?
Amazon  and Nvidia have soared to the top in AI this year, becoming among the best ways to invest in the rapidly 
developing market. However, Nvidia's meteoric stock growth means much of its short-term potential is already 
priced into its shares, making its current position an expensive option. Meanwhile, Amazon's stock remains 29% 
down from its all-time high in July 2021, suggesting it has more room to rise.
Additionally, Amazon's position as the leader of the cloud market  and its recent venture into chips grant it a more 
diversified role in AI. The company has the brand recognition and vast resources to attract big names to its AI 
offerings, which could make it a true threat to Nvidia and others in the market. Meanwhile, Amazon's business as a 
whole appears to be on a growth path after reporting significant improvements in its e-commerce business in Q2 
2023.
As a result, Amazon is the better stock to invest in AI and an excellent long-term investment.
John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board 
of directors. Dani Cook  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and 
recommends Advanced Micro Devices, Amazon.com, Microsoft, and Nvidia. The Motley Fool has a disclosure

 An air traffic control glitch that left thousands of passengers stranded has caused knock-on effects that are set to 
last for days. The government on Tuesday vowed to investigate the "rare" incident.The British government has 
ordered a review into the country's air traffic control system on Tuesday after a glitch stranded thousands of 
passengers and caused delays that are set to last for days. 
More than 1,500 flights were cancelled on Monday, which was a public holiday and one of the year's busiest travel 
dates as school holidays draw to a close. 
Transport Secretary Mark Harper said the incident was the worst of its kind for "nearly a decade" and ordered an 
independent review. 
"This was a technical fault," he told GB News. "We do not think this was a cybersecurity incident." 
Delays for days 
Although the system was brought back online within hours, the United Kingdom's National Air Traffic Services said 
the backlog of flights would last for "several days." 
That's because airline schedules have been disrupted, and many flight crews are still out of place. 
"I know people will be enormously frustrated by the disruption that's impacting them," Prime Minister Rishi Sunak 
said in a broadcast statement. 
"Thankfully things like this are rare and the issue itself was fixed in a matter of hours, but the disruption obviously is 
continuing and will last for a little while longer." 
Airlines battle travel chaos 
British Airways was the worst-affected airline. 
It said it was working "to get back on track" and offered short-haul passengers the option to change their flight dates 
for free. 
Meanwhile, budget carrier Ryanair said on Tuesday that it expected "considerable flight delays" plus some further 
flight cancellations. 
The UK's busiest airport, London Heathrow, told passengers to contact their airline before travelling to the airport on 
Tuesday.

(ANSA) - AUG 28 - Three rightwing Italian League party MEPS on Monday asked the European Commission to 
clarify whether Ryanair's recent action in denying an Italian ALS sufferer a place on a flight from Cagliari to Venice 
was in line with EU law. The Italian engineer, who is unable to breathe because of his ALS, was refused permission 
to bring onto the flight an artificial respirator. The Irish budget airline said this was in line with their policy, which 
differs from other airlines which would have allowed the respirator in the cabin. MEPS Marco Campomenosi, Paolo 
Borchia and Annalisa Tardino, members of the EO's transport committee, also said the passenger was denied 
adequate service on the ground and "re-protection" for another ensuing flight. "If these facts were to be proven it 
would be very serious," said the League MEPS. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neurone 
disease (MND) or Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rare neurodegenerative disease that results in the progressive loss of 
motor neurons that control voluntary muscles. It usually leads to death, quite rapidly in the most severe form, 
although some sufferers like the late physicist Stephen Hawking live on for many years with a less severe form.

The popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to

What are the Zacks Style Scores? 
The Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks 
based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances 
of beating the market over the next 30 days. 
Each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. 
Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the 
better chance the stock will outperform. 
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:

stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value 
Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks. 
Growth Score 
While good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, 
and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into 
account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth. 
Momentum Score 
Momentum traders and investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." This investing style is all about taking 
advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week 
Here's Why Ryanair ( RYAAY ) is a Strong Growth Stock
price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate 
favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks. 
VGM Score 
If you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on 
their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, 
and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. 
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank 
The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or 
changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio. 
It's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 
1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 
companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day. 
With more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are 
right for you and your investing journey. 
That's where the Style Scores come in. 
To maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking 
stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a 
#3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible. 
Since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate 
revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy. 
For instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a 
downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well. 
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better. 
Stock to Watch: Ryanair (RYAAY) 
Ryanair Holdings is the parent company of Ryanair Designated Activity Company (formerly known as Ryanair 
Limited). Ryanair, which commenced its flight operations in 1985, is based in headquartered in Swords, Ireland. 
RYAAY is a #1 (Strong Buy) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A. 
Additionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. RYAAY has a Growth Style Score of A, 
forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 25% for the current fiscal year. 
Four analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus 
Estimate has increased $1.58 to $9.11 per share. RYAAY boasts an average earnings surprise of 17.2%. 
With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, RYAAY should be on investors' short list.

With air travel demand bouncing back strongly from the pandemic lows, prospects of stocks in the Zacks 
Transportation - Airline  industry appear bright indeed. It is well documented that air travel demand is particularly 
strong on the leisure front. What is more encouraging is that international demand made a roaring comeback.The 
decline in fuel expenses represents another tailwind for the industry.
Driven by the abovementioned positives, investors interested in the industry would do well to keep stocks like  
Ryanair Holdings  RYAAY , United Airlines  UAL  and American Airlines   AAL  on their radar.
About the Industry
The Zacks Airline industry players are engaged in transporting passengers and cargo to various destinations 
globally. Most operators maintain a fleet of multiple mainline jets in addition to several regional planes. Their 
operations are aided by their regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers. Additionally, industry 
players utilize their respective cargo divisions to offer a wide range of freight and mail services. The players invest 
substantially to upgrade technology. The industry, apart from comprising legacy carriers, includes low-cost players. 
The well-being of companies in this group is linked to the health of the overall economy. For example, the aviation 
space was one of the worst pandemic-hit corners, with passenger revenues taking a beating. However, air travel 
demand is extremely rosy now. The focus on boosting cargo revenues is a positive too.
Factors Relevant to the Industry's Fortunes
Rosy Air Traffic Scenario:  The stronger-than-expected recovery in air travel demand from pandemic lows is a huge 
positive for the industry, which was one of the worst hit in the peak COVID-19 period. The removal of COVID-
related restrictions is aiding air travel, which is now strong on the international front as well. Reflecting the recovery 
in air travel demand, overall global traffic was up 47.2% in the first half compared with the year-ago period, with 
double-digit increases on both the domestic and international fronts, per IATA.
3 Airline Stocks to Watch Amid Upbeat Passenger Volumes
People are again resorting to air travel as they resume their normal activities. Expecting the strong passenger 
volumes to continue, some airline companies like United Airlines have lifted their earnings per share view for the 
current year.
Declining Fuel Costs:  The southward movement of oil price bodes well for the bottom-line growth of industry 
participants. This is because fuel expenses are a significant input cost for the aviation space. Notably, oil price 
declined 6.6% in the April-June period of 2023. Per IATA, the average jet fuel cost is expected  to be $98.5 per 
barrel in 2023 (earlier forecast was $111.9 per barrel).
High Labor Costs : Increased operating costs are limiting bottom-line growth. With expenses on fuel moving south, 
costs will likely continue to be steep going forward due to escalated labor costs. Moreover, as U.S. airlines grapple 
with pilot shortage, the bargaining power of this labor group has increased. As a result, we have seen pay-hike 
deals being inked in the space. This is resulting in a spike in labor costs. American Airlines recently lifted  its 
forecast for third-quarter non-fuel unit costs due to the four-year pay-related deal with pilots.
Zacks Industry Rank Signals Bright Prospects
The Zacks Airline industry is a 28-stock group within the broader Zacks  Transportation  sector. The industry 
currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #74, which places it in the top 29% of 250 plus Zacks industries.
The group's  Zacks Industry Rank , basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates 
bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the 
bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for 
the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that 
analysts are optimistic about this group's earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimate for 2023 has 
moved up 27.3% since March 2023.
Before we present a few stocks that you may want to add or retain in your portfolio, let's look at the industry's recent 
stock-market performance and its valuation picture.
Industry Lags S&P 500 But Outperforms Sector
Over the past year, the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry has gained 5.8% compared with the S&P 500 
composite's rise of 6%. The broader sector has declined 3.4% in the said time frame.
Valuation Picture
The price/sales (P/S) ratio is often used to value airline stocks. The industry currently has a forward 12-month P/S 
of 0.44X compared with the S&P 500's 3.71X. It is also below the sector's forward-12-month P/S of 1.62X.
Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.02X, as low as 0.33X and at the median of 0.64X.
3 Stocks to Keep a Tab on
Ryanair Holdings ' growth prospects are being supported by an upbeat air travel demand scenario. Upbeat 
passenger volumes are leading to the company posting impressive traffic numbers over the past few months.
Measures to expand its fleet to cater to the rising travel demand are encouraging as well. Riding on the buoyant air-
traffic scenario, RYAAY shares have gained 31% year to date. RYAAY surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
for earnings in each of the last four quarters by 21.4%. Ryanair currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
United Airlines is seeing steady recovery in domestic and international air travel demand. Driven by the rosy air 
travel demand scenario, UAL expects third-quarter earnings per share in the $3.85-$4.35 band. Management has 
3 Airline Stocks to Watch Amid Upbeat Passenger Volumes
lifted its earnings forecast for 2023 and now expects 2023 earnings per share in the band of $11-12 (prior view: 
$10-$12).
Riding on the buoyant air traffic scenario, UAL shares have gained 31.1% year to date. UAL surpassed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters and missed the mark on the other occasion. The 
average beat is 17.2%. UAL too currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.
American Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is benefiting from an improvement in air travel 
demand. Recently, American Airlines' management lifted the earnings per share forecast for 2023. The company 
now expects 2023 earnings (on an adjusted basis) in the band of $3-$3.75 per share (earlier view was in the $2.5-
$3.5 per share range).
Driven by upbeat demand, current-year adjusted operating margin is now anticipated in the 7-9% band (earlier 
guidance:11-13%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AAL's current-year earnings has been revised upward by 
17% in the past 60 days.

3 Dirt-Cheap Stocks That Could Skyrocket

August 25th, 2023 ( The Motley Fool  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Like bargains? Most people do, even when the bargain in question is a stock. And these three stocks are so cheap 
right now that they could soon skyrocket. Their values are arguably just too low for most investors to pass up. All 
they need is the right nudge.
1. Citigroup
It's a tough time to be in the banking  business. Although higher interest rates make lending a higher-margin 
business, the economic weakness that often accompanies periods of rising interest rates also raises the odds of 
delinquencies and defaults. Never even mind the fact that higher interest rates crimp demand for loans.
Citigroup (NYSE: C) isn't immune to either of these headwinds. In fact, it's showing subtle signs that such 
headwinds are already putting some pressure on it. Its total loans as of the end of the second quarter were right 
around where they were a year earlier, and its allowance for credit losses is creeping higher. Deposits are down, 
and the amount of credit card loans between 30 days and 90 days past due is markedly higher now than it was as 
of the end of last year. The banking business seems to be taking a turn for the worse, and investors are acting 
accordingly.
The thing is, the punishment doesn't fit the crime.
Citi share prices are now down by nearly 50% from their mid-2021 peak. And, thanks to their 13% pullback over the 
course of just the past four weeks they're now knocking on the door of a new 52-week low. That has dragged the 
stock's forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio down to less than 7 (based on next year's projected earnings of 
$5.98 per share) and pushed its dividend yield up to around 5%. That's about as cheap as the stock's been in 
several years, and the dividend yield is as high as it has been in over a decade.
That's a dividend, by the way, that isn't in any immediate jeopardy of being halted, or even reduced. Following the 
Fed's recently administered stress tests, the bank raised its quarterly dividend payment for the first time since 2019, 
from $0.51 per share to $0.53 per share.
3 Dirt-Cheap Stocks That Could Skyrocket
2. Expedia
Demand for travel accommodations soared while the COVID-19 pandemic was winding down. Now, however, 
consumers are seemingly starting to balk at such spending. American Airlines ' management has pointed out that 
airfares are declining, which they fear indicates waning demand. In Europe, Ryanair execs recently voiced similar 
concerns. The U.S. Travel Association reports total travel spending in June was only up marginally year over year.
In this vein, although online travel agent Expedia Group (NASDAQ: EXPE) reported a 6% increase in revenue for 
the second quarter along with a 5% year-over-year improvement in total bookings, both figures fell short of analysts' 
consensus estimates.Expedia shares fell 16% the day after it released its Q2 numbers, as the shortfalls were 
broadly seen as evidence of weakening demand for travel services.
Don't be too quick to come to sweeping conclusions based on recent travel-related headlines, though. While the 
industry is a bit rattled right now, the travel business is still likely in better shape than a cursory glance would 
suggest.
Consider, for example, the latest guidance from Expedia rival Booking Holdings. It's forecasting gross bookings 
growth of 20% during the quarter now underway, paired with year-over-year EBITDA growth at the same pace. 
Meanwhile, when it recently reported its Q2 numbers, Delta Air Lines upped its full-year earnings-per-share 
guidance from a range of $5 to $6 to a range of $6 to $7. The airline also reiterated its previous 2024 profit forecast 
of more than $7 per share.
It's not clear why so many investors are pricing in only the red flags when it comes to Expedia stock and ignoring 
the bullish clues. With the stock trading at less than 10 times next year's projected earnings versus sales growth of 
10%, however, you may not want to waste any time trying to figure it out.
3. D.R. Horton
Last but not least, add homebuilder  D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI) to your list of dirt-cheap stocks to buy. It's priced at 
less than 9 times this year's earnings of $13.24 per share, and next year's expected earnings of $13.73 per share. 
Although it's still well up from its mid-2022 low, it has the potential to skyrocket if it bounces back from the sizable 
sell-off it has experienced since late July.
Yes, higher interest rates are a problem for would-be homebuyers. The average interest rate on a 30-year 
mortgage, in fact, is still near the 23-year high of almost 7.5% it hit earlier this month, according to Mortgage News 
Daily. And the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that demand for mortgage loans reached a 28-year low just 
last week, down by 30% from year-ago levels.
Take a closer look at other key real estate data, though. Demand for homes remains robust, as the housing 
shortage persists. The bottleneck is a lack of existing homes available for sale -- that category usually makes up the 
large majority of home purchases and is therefore a key driver of mortgage loan volumes. The National Association 
of Realtors reports that the number of existing homes for sale was back to a multi-year low near 1.1 million as of 
July, extending a decline that got started all the way back in 2008 in the wake of the subprime mortgage meltdown. 
Online realtor Redfin reports a near-record-breaking 31.4% of homes now for sale in the United States are newly 
built homes, yet that's still not enough inventory to sate demand. The National Association of Realtors estimates 
sales of new homes will grow to the tune of 12.3% this year before accelerating to a growth pace of 13.9% next 
year.
That, of course, is good news for D.R. Horton, which can help meet this demand.
It's no mere flash-in-the-pan opportunity either. The National Association of Realtors reckons it could take a decade 
or more of steady effort to build the 5.5 million additional homes the nation needs.
Given this dynamic, it's not clear why this stock is still trading at such a discount. As the old saying goes though, 
never look a gift horse in the mouth.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin International) will reopen its Copenhagen Kastrup base in December 2023,more than eight 
years after a union dispute prompted its closure.
The LCC said it would initially base two B737-800s out of the Danish capital and launch four new routes - to Faro, 
Düsseldorf Weeze, Warsaw Modlin, and Paris Beauvais, while adding more frequencies on its existing routes to 
Kraków and Gdansk.
"All 100 jobs for pilots, cabin crew, and engineers will be recruited under the national collective labour agreement 
Ryanair has agreed with Danske Metal, Denmark's largest national union, and Ryanair looks forward to continued 
growth and investment in Denmark as soon as the Danish regulator makes a decision to lower airport fees at 
Copenhagen Airport," Ryanair Holdings Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said.
The holding previously closed its Copenhagen base in mid-2015 over a pay dispute with local unions. At that time, 
the Irish holding had a policy to refuse recognition of any organised labour, which was reversed amidst growing 
pressure in 2017. Despite the base's closure, Ryanair did not quit Copenhagen altogether and today operates 127 
weekly scheduled departures from the airport using aircraft based elsewhere. It has a 6.6% market share by 
scheduled weekly capacity, trailing only SAS Scandinavian Airlines and Norwegian.
Ryanair has an existing two-aircraft base at Billund, operated by Malta Air (MAY, Malta International).

Italy 'flying in wrong direction' on price caps says FT (3) 'Move could contravene EU law'
Italy 'flying in wrong direction' on price caps says FT (3); 'Move could 
contravene EU law'
ANSA English Corporate Service

Dateline: ROME 
Body
(ANSA) - AUG 24 - The Financial Times has taken a new swipe at the government of Premier Giorgia Meloni, on 
Thursday claiming it is "flying in the wrong direction" with its plans to cap air fares on popular domestic routes and 
limit the use of algorithms to set prices. "If Italy's prime minister Giorgia Meloni thinks a cap on prices is the way to 
lower the fares of trips to the summer hotspots of Sicily and Sardinia, she is mistaken - and not just because such a 
move could contravene EU law," writes International business editor Peggy Hollinger. "Any price cap will almost 
certainly lead to higher fares across the year," she continued, adding that "the move to limit profiling algorithms also 
presumes that the aviation industry is more technologically sophisticated than it really is". "Very few airlines are 
remotely close to having the intelligence required to personalise pricing for those not in their loyalty programmes," 
insists Hollinger, saying that artificial intelligence isn't the answer either. 
"The government may be cynically tapping into this general discontent (with airlines) to win a few headlines" but 
ministers "know (the measures) are impossible to implement," she concludes. Earlier this month the government 
approved a decree banning the use of algorithms if applied to connections to Sicily and Sardinia; if applied to peaks 
in demand linked to seasonal factors; and if they lead to the price of tickets or accessory services being 200% 
higher than the average price. Last week the trade body Airlines for Europe (A4E) called on Brussels "to clarify with 
Italy that this intervention impacts the free and deregulated air transport market in Europe", arguing that it could "set 
a precedent and lead to a domino effect". Limiting fares would "violate" the rights of companies to '"compete 
wherever possible, set prices and define services as they see fit", the trade body added. Ryanair CEO Eddie Wilson 
has also blasted the measure and called for it to be scrapped. "It's ridiculous, illegal and interferes with the free 
market, according to European law," Wilson told ANSA last Wednesday. "It must be cancelled. "If it isn't, there will 
be an impact on Ryanair's ability to operate in Italy," he added. The European Commission subsequently said that it 
has asked for clarifications from Rome, adding that price capping is rarely an effective means of achieving 
affordable prices. "The commission supports measures to promote connectivity at an affordable price in line with 
EU internal market rules," said Commission spokesperson Adalbert Jahnz. "Sustainable competition with free price 
setting is usually the best guarantor of affordable prices in the EU's highly successful and liberalised transport 
market," he added.

J ust mention the words Italy and price cap and the blood pressure at Ryanair's head office shoots off the scale.
That happened last week when I tried to talk to Eddie Wilson, the budget airline's chief executive, about Italy's 
recent proposal to cap fares from the mainland to Sicily and Sardinia at 200 per cent above the annual average, 
and to limit the use of "profiling algorithms" to set prices.
"They think we have algorithms that mean I can tell which people have iPhones and we charge them more. 
Rubbish," said Wilson in one of his calmer moments. Air fares "are built on demand. If flights aren't moving we 
lower fares." The implication was that, obviously, the reverse must be true if demand exceeds supply.
Air fares have risen substantially in the post-coronavirus era, up 30 per cent this summer in Europe compared with 
last year. Airlines complain of a scarcity of aircraft and labour, as well as higher fuel costs, even as they report 
bumper profits on the back of increased fares. But the industry's net margins this year are still forecast to hit only 
1.2 per cent.
So if Giorgia Meloni, Italy's prime minister, thinks that a cap on prices is the way to lower the fares for trips to the 
summer hotspots of Sicily and Sardinia, she is mistaken - and not just because such a move could contravene EU 
law.
Meloni's air fare price cap idea won't fly but will pull in some votes
Any price cap will almost certainly lead to higher fares across the year. Why would any airline offer rock-bottom 
prices out of season - when locals may be the main passengers - if they only drag down the average and, by 
extension, their ability to price according to demand in peak season?
Yes, they want to fill their aircraft during the winter months. But the frequency of flights can be scaled back and 
extra aircraft used on other routes to drive those prices higher.
Italy's move to impose limits on profiling algorithms also presumes that the aviation industry is more technologically 
sophisticated than it really is.
"Most airlines run on systems that were designed in the stone age of technology," says Anand Krishnan, chief 
executive of IBS Software, a leading supplier to airlines.
'Your biggest to maximise is to sell all the and then sell beyond the seat'
Essentially, carriers divide a flight into "buckets" of seats with different fares, based on expected demand and what 
the competition is doing. When one bucket sells out, customers are directed to the next one.
But as many airlines sell a many of their tickets through global distribution systems, they do not usually know who a 
passenger is, what their spending power might be, and what might push them to buy. As a result, the carriers are 
often left with empty seats.
"Your biggest opportunity to maximise revenue is to sell all the seats and then sell things beyond the seat," says 
Krishnan. "The right call might have been to make that sale at $150 instead of $200."
Very few airlines are remotely close to having the intelligence required to personalise pricing for those passengers 
who are not members of their loyalty programmes.
Nor is artificial intelligence the answer.
"Even if [the airlines] could dynamically create a price point for you, their revenue management, accounting and 
invoicing systems cannot cope with anything close to the complexity required," Krishnan adds.
Instead, airlines have resorted to unbundling the fare into its constituent parts - the seats, luggage, boarding priority, 
etc - asking passengers to pay for what suits their needs. They are also trying to sell a host of extra services, from 
cars to insurance to holidays, forcing travellers to wade through page after page of marketing.
"It's a dilemma because you have to maximise revenues in a competitive arena," says Andrea Giuricin, a transport 
economist. "But it means that you are making it more difficult for the customer."
That strategy has driven suspicion that airlines are charging more and delivering less. According to a recent survey 
by Which?, the UK consumer rights group, bankers are more trusted than airlines. In the US, a Gallup poll last year 
found that for the first time in a decade that more passengers had a negative view of the industry than positive.
Meloni's government may be cynically tapping into this general discontent to win a few headlines with measures 
that ministers know are impossible to implement. But the initiative would not feel like a vote winner if airlines 
understood their passengers in the first place - and were able to deliver a better service.

prices out of season - when locals may be the main passengers - if they only drag down the average and, by 
extension, their ability to price according to demand in peak season?
Yes, they want to fill their aircraft during the winter months. But the frequency of flights can be scaled back and 
extra aircraft used on other routes to drive those prices higher.
Italy's move to impose limits on profiling algorithms also presumes that the aviation industry is more technologically 
sophisticated than it really is.
"Most airlines run on systems that were designed in the stone age of technology," says Anand Krishnan, chief 
executive of IBS Software, a leading supplier to airlines.
'Your biggest to maximise is to sell all the and then sell beyond the seat'
Essentially, carriers divide a flight into "buckets" of seats with different fares, based on expected demand and what 
the competition is doing. When one bucket sells out, customers are directed to the next one.
But as many airlines sell a many of their tickets through global distribution systems, they do not usually know who a 
passenger is, what their spending power might be, and what might push them to buy. As a result, the carriers are 
often left with empty seats.
"Your biggest opportunity to maximise revenue is to sell all the seats and then sell things beyond the seat," says 
Krishnan. "The right call might have been to make that sale at $150 instead of $200."
Very few airlines are remotely close to having the intelligence required to personalise pricing for those passengers 
who are not members of their loyalty programmes.
Nor is artificial intelligence the answer.
"Even if [the airlines] could dynamically create a price point for you, their revenue management, accounting and 
invoicing systems cannot cope with anything close to the complexity required," Krishnan adds.
Instead, airlines have resorted to unbundling the fare into its constituent parts - the seats, luggage, boarding priority, 
etc - asking passengers to pay for what suits their needs. They are also trying to sell a host of extra services, from 
cars to insurance to holidays, forcing travellers to wade through page after page of marketing.
"It's a dilemma because you have to maximise revenues in a competitive arena," says Andrea Giuricin, a transport 
economist. "But it means that you are making it more difficult for the customer."
That strategy has driven suspicion that airlines are charging more and delivering less. According to a recent survey 
by Which?, the UK consumer rights group, bankers are more trusted than airlines. In the US, a Gallup poll last year 
found that for the first time in a decade that more passengers had a negative view of the industry than positive.
Meloni's government may be cynically tapping into this general discontent to win a few headlines with measures 
that ministers know are impossible to implement. But the initiative would not feel like a vote winner if airlines 
understood their passengers in the first place - and were able to deliver a better service.

J ust mention the words Italy and price cap and the blood pressure at Ryanair's head office shoots off the scale.
That happened last week when I tried to talk to Eddie Wilson, the budget airline's chief executive, about Italy's 
recent proposal to cap fares from the mainland to Sicily and Sardinia at 200 per cent above the annual average, 
and to limit the use of "profiling algorithms" to set prices.
"They think we have algorithms that mean I can tell which people have iPhones and we charge them more. 
Rubbish," said Wilson in one of his calmer moments. Air fares "are built on demand. If flights aren't moving we 
lower fares." The implication was that, obviously, the reverse must be true if demand exceeds supply.
Air fares have risen substantially in the post-coronavirus era, up 30 per cent this summer in Europe compared with 
last year. Airlines complain of a scarcity of aircraft and labour, as well as higher fuel costs, even as they report 
bumper profits on the back of increased fares. But the industry's net margins this year are still forecast to hit only 
1.2 per cent.
So if Giorgia Meloni, Italy's prime minister, thinks that a cap on prices is the way to lower the fares for trips to the 
summer hotspots of Sicily and Sardinia, she is mistaken - and not just because such a move could contravene EU 
law.

Happy first birthday to Runway 10L/28R at Dublin Airport (more commonly known as "North Runway") which 
opened on-time and on-budget on this day last year.
Since the inaugural flight - a Ryanair flight to Eindhoven - departed shortly after noon on August 24, 2022, just over 
4.9 million passengers have taken off or landed on the new 3.1km runway, enabling increased connectivity for 
tourism, trade and FDI.

3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks With More Potential Than Any Cryptocurrency
3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks With More Potential Than Any 
Cryptocurrency

August 24th, 2023 ( The Motley Fool  — Delivered by  Newstex )
According to data from Grand View Research, the world's most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is projected to have 
a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27% through 2030. Meanwhile, the artificial intelligence (AI) market is 
expected to have a CAGR of 36% in the same period.
While other crypto options might offer more growth, it's hard to justify passing up the reliability of the tech market for 
the potential volatility that has become commonplace among cryptocurrencies.
The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT last November kicked off a boom in AI and has attracted countless tech 
companies. It is expected to boost numerous sectors across tech, including cloud computing, healthcare, consumer 
products, education, and more. As a result, investing in the companies pushing the technology could be a way to 
enjoy significant gains over the long term.
Here are three artificial intelligence stocks with more potential than any cryptocurrency.
1. Advanced Micro Devices
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has a history of outperforming the crypto market. Its stock has climbed 
about 425% in the last five years, with Bitcoin's price rising 310% in the same period. Even since the start of 2023, 
AMD has offered more growth than the cryptocurrency.
The chipmaker is investing heavily in AI, pouring significant resources into developing hardware that will match 
market leader Nvidia 's products.
In June, it debuted the MI300X, which the company calls its most powerful graphics process unit (GPU). It remains 
to be seen what companies will use the MI300X, but AMD has lots of support since increased competition will bring 
down the cost of chips.
3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks With More Potential Than Any Cryptocurrency
It also expanded its position in AI last year with the acquisition of Xilinx, which has developed software that uses AI 
accelerators. And that experience in the field led AMD to bring on Victor Peng, former president of Xilinx, as its 
head of AI strategy.
As a leading chipmaker, AMD has great possibilities in AI, with its growth history giving it more potential than any 
cryptocurrency, making its stock an attractive buy this month.
2. Amazon
Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has exciting prospects in artificial intelligence as the home of the world's largest cloud 
platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company has made a major push into the technology this year by 
unveiling several new AI tools on that platform.
In June, the company debuted Bedrock, a service that helps clients build chatbots and image generators. Another 
new service, CodeWhisperer, is geared toward developers by producing code. And HealthScribe can transcribe 
meetings between doctors and patients.
These new services attracted thousands of customers to AWS, with Sony, Ryanair, and Sun Life Financial among 
the companies recently signing on to use Bedrock.
Amazon is further diversifying its position in AI by becoming one of the first cloud companies to venture into chip 
production. The company announced in June that it had developed two new chips, promising the best price-to-
performance in the market. The tech giant's brand recognition and dominance in the cloud industry could attract 
many companies to its hardware.
Amazon's stock has increased by 61% since Jan. 1, outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum. With expanding positions 
in multiple areas of AI, the company could offer far more gains over the long term.
3. Apple
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) holds leading market shares in smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. 
This command over tech gives it the potential to become a leading driver in the public adoption of AI. Studies have 
proven consumers' preference for Apple's products, which will be the tools to get AI into the hands of millions of 
users worldwide.
In early August, Tim Cook said in an earnings call that an increase in research and development spending was 
driven primarily by work on generative AI. And Bloomberg reported in July that Apple has built its own framework for 
creating large language models and has used it to develop an AI chatbot that its engineers have dubbed Apple 
GPT.
The iPhone maker is gradually introducing AI-enabled features across its product lineup. In June, Apple  announced 
a revamp to the iPhone's autocorrect that uses a language model to better predict users' texting styles. AirPods Pro 
will automatically turn off noise canceling once the wearer starts a conversation, a feature made possible by AI.
Apple is the world's most valuable company, becoming the first to achieve a market cap of $3 trillion earlier this 
year. The company's journey in AI isn't as far along as it is for companies like Microsoft or Amazon. However, that 
could mean its stock has more room to run. Meanwhile, its dominance in multiple areas of tech and vast resources 
could take it far with AI. And with that, Apple's stock is a far better bet than any cryptocurrency.
John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board 
of directors. Dani Cook  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and 
recommends Advanced Micro Devices, Amazon.com, Apple, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Microsoft, and Nvidia. The Motley 
Fool has a disclosure policy .

Boeing has for the first time revealed the sales breakdown for its 737 Max family, with the developmental -10 
closing in on the 1,000-order mark.
Although the baseline 737 Max 8 remains the most popular variant of the twinjet – Boeing has unfilled orders for 
2,751 examples and has already delivered 965 units – the Max 10 is the next most popular family member, with the 
airframer sitting on an undelivered backlog of 810 aircraft.
The largest aircraft in the Max family, able to accommodate up to 230 passengers, the Max 10 is the only aircraft in 
Boeing’s narrowbody line-up capable of competing with the Airbus A321neo, particularly its long-range LR and XLR 
variants.
Boeing advertises the 737 Max 10 as capable of carrying 188-204 passengers in a two-class layout on routes of up 
to 3,100nm (5,740km), versus 180-220 for the A321XLR, which has an advertised range of 4,700nm.
Both aircraft are currently in development and are expected to enter service next year.
Meanwhile, the high-density 737 Max 8-200 has attracted 468 net orders, with 124 aircraft having been delivered as 
of 31 July. Irish budget carrier Ryanair accounts for almost 45% of the total, having placed orders for 210 examples.
Rounding out the narrowbody line-up are the 737 Max 9 – of which Boeing has delivered 187 units and holds 
unfilled orders for 137 aircraft – and the Max 7, with 297 orders. The latter jet is expected to enter service next year 
following a recent schedule adjustment.
The total undelivered backlog for the 737 Max family at the end of July stood at 4,339 aircraft. Although Boeing lists 
4,358 total unfilled orders for the 737 – including 17 P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft and a pair of -800s – 
accounting adjustments remove 519 aircraft, leaving a firm 737 backlog of 3,839 jets.
Max order split shows growing appeal of -10

Low-cost Irish carrier group Ryanair has announced that it will reopen its base at Copenhagen Airport (CPH), with 
its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) wearing a themed outfit for the occasion.
Dressed in a Denmark-themed t-shirt plus a Viking helmet, Michael O'Leary, the CEO of Ryanair Group, announced 
that Ryanair will place two aircraft at CPH from the winter 2023 season onwards.
"We already operate 20 routes from Copenhagen Airport but they are all on aircraft that are based elsewhere," 
O'Leary said in a video shared on X, adding that the pair of Boeing 737s will fly out from CPH starting early 
December 2023.
According to Ryanair's release, the resurrected base will create 100 direct pilot, cabin crew and engineering jobs in 
the Danish capital, where the airline is already the third largest in terms of its market size on flights from/to CPH.
The Irish low-cost carrier also has a two-aircraft base at Billund Airport (BLL), Denmark, known for its close 
proximity to Legoland.
O'Leary pointed out that the base "represents a further $200m investment by Ryanair in the recovery of air traffic 
and tourism in Copenhagen" which is lagging behind its pre-pandemic levels. "Ryanair believes this is because of 
the high airport fees and the high fares being charged by NAS and SAS, which hampers recovery of Danish traffic 
and tourism," the Irish executive said.
He noted: "Ryanair looks froward to continued growth and investment in Denmark as soon as the Danish Regulator 
makes a decision to lower airport fees at Copenhagen Airport," adding that lower fees would be passed down to 
passengers in the form of lower fares.
Ryanair first opened a base at CPH in October 2014, which became the 70th base on its network. However, the 
situation did not last long, as the low-cost carrier relocated the base to Kaunas Airport (KUN), Lithuania in July 
2014, when local Danish unions looked to strike against the airline.
"John Dybart of the Danish unions this week claimed that 'Ryanair was bluffing' when we threatened to close the 
whole Copenhagen base," Eddie Wilson, the CEO of the airline Ryanair, said at the time. "Perhaps now he will

realise that the Danish economy and the Danish unions cannot succeed by forcing Danish jobs overseas," Wilson 
continued, as reported by Denmark's The Local.

 Budget airlines Ryanair (RYA.IR) and Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) are among the worst offenders for "drip-selling" in Europe 
as they charge the highest hidden fees to customers, City AM reported Monday, citing research from money-saving 
voucher site Netvouchercodes.
Ryanair's additional fees account for 344% of its average 18.39 pound-sterling flight cost, while Wizz Air charges an 
average of 93.56 pounds in hidden costs. Easyjet's (EZJ.L) hidden costs total 62.84 pounds on average or 170% of 
its flight cost, the report said.
However, Ryanair and Wizz Air denied the claims in the report for being "factually inaccurate" as add-ons such as 
seat selection and onboard WiFi are optional for customers, the report said.
Shares in Ryanair were up almost 1%, Wizz Air gained more than 1%, and EasyJet lost marginally on Monday's 
close.

Aug 22, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 For those looking to find strong Transportation stocks, it is prudent to search for companies in the group that are 
outperforming their peers. Ryanair (RYAAY) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but 
do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? A quick glance at the company's year-to-date 
performance in comparison to the rest of the Transportation sector should help us answer this question. 
Ryanair is a member of our Transportation group, which includes 131 different companies and currently sits at #13 
in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to 
worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. 
The Zacks Rank is a proven system that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions, highlighting a 
variety of stocks that are displaying the right characteristics to beat the market over the next one to three months. 
Ryanair is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RYAAY's full-year earnings has moved 23.3% higher within the past quarter. 
This is a sign of improving analyst sentiment and a positive earnings outlook trend. 
According to our latest data, RYAAY has moved about 33.2% on a year-to-date basis. Meanwhile, stocks in the 
Transportation group have gained about 8.6% on average. This shows that Ryanair is outperforming its peers so far 
this year. 
United Airlines (UAL) is another Transportation stock that has outperformed the sector so far this year. Since the 
beginning of the year, the stock has returned 31.7%. 
The consensus estimate for United Airlines' current year EPS has increased 21% over the past three months. The 
stock currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). 
Looking more specifically, Ryanair belongs to the Transportation - Airline industry, a group that includes 30 
individual stocks and currently sits at #73 in the Zacks Industry Rank. This group has gained an average of 13.5% 
so far this year, so RYAAY is performing better in this area. United Airlines is also part of the same industry. 
Going forward, investors interested in Transportation stocks should continue to pay close attention to Ryanair and 
United Airlines as they could maintain their solid performance.

Claims and counterclaims in Ryanair 's battle with OTAs
Claims and counterclaims in Ryanair's battle with OTAs

The battle between Ryanair (FR, Dublin International) and online travel agencies (OTAs) continues without pause. 
While the low-cost carrier has enjoyed a legal win in Italy against Kiwi.com, another front is opening in the United 
Kingdom, with a group of OTAs complaining to government regulators about the airline.
This week, the Civil Court of Milan dismissed an injunction application by OTA Kiwi.com to remove Ryanair's check-
in procedures for passengers who used OTAs to make bookings. "We welcome this Court ruling," said Ryanair's 
Dara Brady. "Ryanair does not have a commercial relationship with Kiwi, and we strongly object to Kiwi selling our 
flights."
The low-cost carrier applies so-called "enhanced check-in procedures" for passengers who book flights from any 
fare reseller, whether authorised or unauthorised. It requires passengers to submit significant amounts of personal 
information, including providing images for facial verification, to manage a booking or check-in online.
OTAs argue that the data collection is unnecessary and its real aim is to send prospective passengers to Ryanair's 
own booking portal. Last week, as reported in the Irish Times, several OTAs, including Booking.com, Expedia, and 
Skyscanner, wrote to the UK's Civil Aviation Authority and Information Commissioner's Office, calling on both 
bodies to investigate the airline.
"Ryanair may be breaching UK data protection rules which require data collection to be necessary and kept to a 
minimum, which is clearly not the case with these additional checks," their letter read.
Ryanair says its business model depends on passengers using its own booking portal and alleges many OTAs 
"mis-sell" their fares. They say the data collection is necessary for them to contact passengers directly if an issue 
arises with their flight.
The airline also promptly responded to the OTAs' call for an investigation, saying OTAs that scrapped fare data for 
resale amounted to nothing more than "internet pirates." In a statement issued on August 11, Ryanair said its data 
collection policy, in addition to smoothing out communication procedures with passengers, also ensures the airline 
complies with its legal obligations.
"Unsuspecting consumers are being duped and/or overcharged by this group of OTAs who unlawfully scrape 
Ryanair's website (a clear example of "internet piracy"), who then use this unlawfully obtained data to mislead 
Claims and counterclaims in Ryanair 's battle with OTAs
consumers and mis-sell our flights with significant mark-ups," Ryanair's statement said. "Among the members of 
this "Pirates of the European" association are OTAs who knowingly overcharge consumers for Ryanair fares and/or 
ancillary services such as bag check-in, seat allocation, flight changes, etc."
Ryanair says it has repeatedly called on the Competition and Markets Authority and the Civil Aviation Authority to 
take action against the OTAs. "We are amazed that the UK Consumer Agencies and the UK Govt have failed to 
take any action against this rampant internet piracy and this overcharging of unsuspecting consumers for airfares or 
ancillary services," said Group CEO Michael O'Leary while again reiterating his airline's call for an investigation.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) said Aug. 18 it filed an appeal against Aena's (AENA.MC) plan to increase fees at its airports in 
Spain, noting that the proposal violates a five-year freeze imposed by the government in 2021.
The Irish low-cost air carrier urged the Spanish Council of Ministers and the Spanish regulator CNMC to enforce the 
government regulation freezing airport charges until 2027. The company claimed that the ruling played an important 
role in the air traffic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic.
The airline also argued that Aena's move to increase charges will negatively impact jobs in the local tourism 
industry, as well as air connectivity in the peripheral island regions of the Canaries and Balearics.
Ryanair lost 1% at the close of trading on Aug. 18, while Aena marginally fell.

Causeway Capital Management leader
Sarah Ketterer  ( Trades , Portfolio ) disclosed her second-quarter portfolio earlier this month.
Seeking to post superior risk-adjusted returns, the guru's Los Angeles-based firm, which she founded with Harry 
Hartford in 2001, invests in mispriced equities in both developed and emerging markets. The investment team looks 
for potential opportunities among mid- and large-cap companies using quantitative and value-oriented methods. 
Each stock also receives a risk score based on the amount of volatility it adds to the portfolio. The team then enters 
positions in the stocks with the highest expected risk-adjusted returns that also have a lower price-earnings ratio 
and higher dividend yield than the market.
With these criteria in mind, the 13F filing shows Ketterer's firm entered nine new positions during the three months 
ended June 30, sold out of nine stocks and trimmed or added to a number of other existing investments. The most 
significant trades included a new stake in AbbVie Inc. (
ABBV ,  Financial ), reduced bets on Canadian National Railway Co. (  CNI  ,  Financial ), Ryanair Holdings PLC (  
RYAAY  ,  Financial ) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (  TSM  ,  Financial ) and the divestment 
of Credicorp Ltd. (  BAP  ,  Financial ).
Investors should be aware that 13F filings do not give a complete picture of a firm's holdings as the reports only 
include its positions in U.S. stocks and American depository receipts, but they can still provide valuable information. 
Further, the reports only reflect trades and holdings as of the most-recent portfolio filing date, which may or may not 
be held by the reporting firm today or even when this article was published.

In this week's episode, we discuss:
Automation and the elderly
When an elderly couple were charged 110 by Ryanair to print out their boarding passes this week, the airline was 
roundly criticised. But is this a portent of wider problems to come? Rail companies are planning to close ticket 
offices, an increasing number of shops are refusing to take cash and many services now require an app or an 
online account. Will those unable or unwilling to use technology find themselves excluded from society?
Edgy books
A children's book on Princess Diana has garnered controversy this week, as it intends to discuss bulimia. While 
some have suggested tackling such a sensitive topic is a pioneering force for education and openness, others find it 
inappropriate to introduce young children to such themes. Is omitting challenging topics from childrens' literature a 
form of censorship? Or do authors and parents alike have a duty to shield young minds from issues they do not yet 
understand?
Women and alcohol
The Week Unwrapped: Age barriers, women's drinking and edgy books
A new study in the US has found that more women are dying from alcohol than ever before. Experts point the finger 
at an increase in marketing of alcohol towards women with surveys suggesting more women are drinking to excess 
for fun than ever before - but is enough known on the gender divide when it comes to how alcohol affects the body 
and what about the 'sober curious' next generation of adults?

August 18th, 2023 ( The Week UK  — Delivered by  Newstex )
England's Lionesses are looking to make history when they face Spain in the Women's World Cup final on Sunday.
After their stunning 3-1 victory over hosts Australia  this week, the Lionesses will now be aiming to become the first 
senior England football team since 1966 to lift a World Cup.
But as excitement builds across the country, fans of the women's game have been left disgruntled by the news that 
Prince William, president of the Football Association (FA) and as such responsible for promoting the sport both 
nationally and internationally, would not be attending the final at Stadium Australia in Sydney.
The FA said a trip down under had never been planned despite the chance of England reaching the final. But the 
lack of royal attendance could prove controversial after the Royal Spanish Football Federation announced that 
Spain's Queen Letizia and her 16-year-old daughter Sofia will be at the game, 'to show, once again, the royal 
household's support for national football'.
Meanwhile, in the US, leading Republican presidential hopefuls, including Donald Trump, former vice-president 
Mike Pence and Florida governor Ron DeSantis, kicked off their campaigns at a traditional state fair  last weekend.
Trump, the former president, showed he would 'not concede even a moment of the spotlight' to his rivals, said The 
New York Times. He was given 'a much warmer reception' than his main challenger DeSantis, who has 'struggled 
to connect with voters in more unscripted moments' and was even booed by the very Trump supporters he 'hopes 
to win over'.

In the past week, Southwest Airlines  LUV  received encouraging news on the labor front when it reached a 
provisional agreement with the union that represents more than 17,000 of its ramp, operations, provisioning and 
cargo employees.
Meanwhile, Copa Holdings ' CPA  traffic report for July was impressive owing to the post-pandemic surge in air 
travel demand. Owing to the uptick in passenger volumes, European carrier Ryanair Holdings  RYAAY  anticipates 
carrying a higher number of passengers in the current month than in July. If the expectation materializes, RYAAY 
would establish a new monthly traffic record.
Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories
1. The provisional deal inked between LUV's management and the Transport Workers Union Local 555 or TWU 555 
provides substantial wage increase, better retirement and other benefits to the concerned employees.  The deal will 
materialize only if it is approved through the ratification voting process. The details of LUV's current agreement and 
voting timeline will be directly communicated to Southwest Airlines' members by TWU 555.
2. In July, revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) rose in double digits, i.e., 12.5% on a year-over-year 
basis at CPA. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In July, available seat miles (a measure 
of capacity) increased 9.9% year over year. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor 
(percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved to 89% from 87% in July 2022.
Copa Holdings was also in the news when it reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues for 
second-quarter 2023. The news was covered in the previous week's write up .
3. According to a  Reuters report , Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings expects to carry more passengers in August than 
the actual figure in July. We remind investors that Ryanair carried 18.7 million passengers in July, which itself is a 
record. The load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) in July was as high as 96%.
Airline Stock Roundup: LUV 's Tentative Labor Deal, CPA's Traffic Report & More
Per Eddie Wilson, the head of Ryanair DAC, the largest airline in the group, 'It should be slightly more (than July) 
people are still travelling.' Healthy booking trends have resulted in the upbeat expectation. Ryanair has been 
benefiting from the stronger-than-expected recovery in air travel demand from the pandemic lows.
Currently, RYAAY carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
4.  In a bid to meet   the strong recovery in international travel in the post-pandemic scenario, Delta Air Lines  DAL  
has decided to expand its flight schedule to China. To this end, this Atlanta-based carrier has decided to operate 10 
weekly flights to the Shanghai-Pudong International Airport from its hubs in Seattle and Detroit hubs this winter. 
From Oct 29, the airline will operate daily flights from Shanghai and three-times-a-week flights from Detroit. 
Moreover, Delta intends to resume four-times-weekly flights to the Shanghai-Pudong International Airport from Los 
Angeles. DAL has not operated on the route since early 2020.
According to a Reuters report , American Airlines  AAL  has also decided to expand its China operations. The 
carrier has decided to commence daily flights from Dallas-Fort Worth to Shanghai-Pudong International Airport from 
January 2024.

August 18th, 2023 ( The Motley Fool  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The COVID-19 pandemic and 2022's economic downturn have made the last few years challenging for 
stockholders. The market has gone through extreme fluctuations, with companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) 
being some of the hardest hit.
The retail giant thrived amid lockdowns in 2021 as homebound consumers opted to buy most things online. 
However, macroeconomic headwinds the following year brought e-commerce sales crashing down. Despite the 
setbacks, easing inflation and an expansion in artificial intelligence (AI) appearto have Amazon back on a growth 
path.
Here's why Amazon is my top growth stock to buy right now.
Expanding in multiple high-growth markets
Amazon shares have risen 8% since the company released its second quarter of 2023 earnings on Aug. 2. 
Investors have grown increasingly bullish as its e-commerce business recovers and the tech giant pivots its cloud 
services to AI.
Data from Statista shows the e-commerce industry is projected to hit $4 trillion in 2023 and achieve $6 trillion by 
2027.Meanwhile, Amazon holds a leading 38% market share in the sector.The company's dominance in the 
industry suggests it has the most to gain as online-retail purchases rise over the long term despite a dip in sales last 
year.
In Q2 2023, Amazon's North American segment hit more than $3 billion in operating income after reporting losses 
of $627 million the year before. The improvement has come thanks to easing inflation and strategic moves by 
Amazon, which included scaling back on operational warehouses, shuttering less profitable businesses, and layoffs. 
The comeback has proven the company's resilience and ability to pivot under economically challenging conditions.
Here's My Top Growth Stock to Buy Now
In addition to e-commerce growth, Amazon is making promising moves in AI . The market is projected to develop at 
a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030.Meanwhile, the tech giant swiftly expanded its AI offerings on 
its cloud platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) this year.
In June, the company unveiled a service called Bedrock, which uses a language model similar to OpenAI's 
ChatGPT to help clients build chatbots and other generative tools. AWS also recently debuted a code generator 
called CodeWhisperer. It's meant to make software development more efficient. The new AI-enabled services have 
attracted thousands of customers, including companies such as Sony, Ryanair, and Sun Life.
Amazon's dominating positions in e-commerce and the cloud market give it massive potential over the long term, 
making its stock one of the most attractive investments this year.
A bargain buy
Despite a recent rally, Amazon's stock still has a long way to go before surpassing the all-time high it achieved 
during COVID-19 lockdowns. Its share price was 26% down from July 2021, suggesting significant growth potential.
Meanwhile, the chart below illustrates how some of Amazon's biggest competitors, including Apple, Alphabet, and 
Microsoft, have experienced far more stock growth since then. If Amazon can continue to deliver e-commerce gains 
and expand its AI profits, the company could be the best long-term investment among these companies.
Data by YCharts.
Wall Street seems equally optimistic. Amazon's average 12-month price target of $167 is about 21% higher than its 
current position. Analysts are increasingly confident in Amazon's ability to use its leading cloud-market share to its 
advantage in AI and eventually outperform companies like Microsoft and Alphabet.
Over the last decade, Amazon's annual revenue gained more than 1,500%, while operating income climbed 590%. 
In that time, the company achieved dominating positions in retail, cloud computing, video streaming, consumer 
robotics, and more, which have seen it become the world's fifth most valuable company by market cap.
Recent challenges have wreaked havoc on Amazon's stock. However, its gradual recovery in 2023 and long-term 
potential in multiple high-growth markets make it one of the best growth stocks  to buy right now.

CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. Dani 
Cook  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Alphabet, 
Amazon.com, Apple, and Microsoft. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .

Ryanair Triumphs in Legal Battle Against Online Travel Agency Kiwi

Ryanair welcomed the recent ruling of the Civil Court of Milan against online travel agency (OTA) Kiwi.
In a press release, issued on August 17, 2023, the Irish low-cost carrier group said that it welcomed the court's 
decision to prevent passengers who booked Ryanair flights through Kiwi from not using the airline's "enhanced-
security check-in procedures for passengers whose bookings were made by [OTAs]".
"We welcome this Court ruling which ensures passengers who have booked via OTAs can continue to use our 
enhanced-security check-in procedures to check-in personally with Ryanair and are notified of important safety, 
security and public health protocols, and to correct passenger contact details," Dara Brady, the director of 
Marketing & Digital at Ryanair, said.
The executive added that the low-cost carrier has no relationship with the OTA, while also strongly objecting to Kiwi 
selling its flights.
As such, Ryanair encourages its customers "to look out for the Ryanair Verified Seal, a branded tick which 
guarantees you are booking via an official Ryanair channel, and to book directly with us through our website or 
mobile app to get the best Ryanair service and the lowest fares".
In early August 2023, the Irish low-cost carrier reiterated that customers should only use official Ryanair channels to 
book flights, arguing that OTAs "provide airlines with inaccurate passenger details which can block passengers 
from managing their bookings and making the necessary security declarations required for travel, as well as 
preventing them from receiving important travel information from the airline, including potential departure time 
changes, delays, and cancellation updates".
"Ryanair has long campaigned to protect customers from the malpractices of OTAs, including the introduction of a 
customer verification process, which enables passengers who have booked via OTAs to identify themselves to 
Ryanair in order to comply with flight safety and security protocols," the airline said at the time.
Brady also said at the time that OTAs "continue to mislead passengers to believe that they are getting the cheapest 
price available by falsely advertising lower fares than the airlines themselves".

Highlight: Travel company TUI have announced that it will incorporate OpenAI's ChatGPT into its UK mobile app.
Body
The generative AI features will provide customers with personalised holiday recommendations, including location 
and restaurant suggestions.  TUI state that this feature was developed out of an experiment into generative AI by 
three of its tech engineers.  The company also clarified that the launch is part of a wider initiative to feature AI 
across its products. The company announced they had launched an internal AI lab. TUI's AI lab aims to provide 
training and guidance to staff members and further testing of AI in post-holiday customer communications is also 
underway.  TUI CEO Sebastian Ebel has an optimistic outlook on generative AI.  "ChatGPT technology can help to 
simplify processes and services for customers or make information more easily available." 
Ebel explains, "Our goal is to be a leader in the use of new technologies and to actively shape the future of 
tourism."  TUI assures its customers that their data is not being shared when using the new AI features.  The 
company also state that safeguards and a developing team have been put in place to mitigate the potential for 
inappropriate generated responses. According to TUI, a constant feedback loop has been put in place to ensure the 
features run smoothly and uphold TUI standards.  TUI's reassurance over data privacy is vital to customer trust.  
Just this July privacy rights advocates NYOB launched a complaint towards Ryanair for its use of biometric data in 
its online booking system.  In a 2023 GlobalData survey, 43% of businesses stated that AI was already significantly 
disrupting their industries. A further 15% believed that AI would begin to disrupt their sector in the next 12 months.  
As AI becomes more widely used in online holiday bookings and customer relationship management, businesses 
will have to ensure that they are taking precautions to uphold consumer trust.

Aug 17, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Southwest Airlines LUV[1] received encouraging news on the labor front when it reached a 
provisional agreement with the union that represents more than 17,000 of its ramp, operations, provisioning and 
cargo employees. 
Meanwhile, Copa Holdings' CPA[2] traffic report for July was impressive owing to the post-pandemic surge in air 
travel demand. Owing to the uptick in passenger volumes, European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] anticipates 
carrying a higher number of passengers in the current month than in July. If the expectation materializes, RYAAY 
would establish a new monthly traffic record. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. The provisional 
deal inked between LUV's management and the Transport Workers Union Local 555 or TWU 555 provides 
substantial wage increase, better retirement and other benefits to the concerned employees. The deal will 
materialize only if it is approved through the ratification voting process. The details of LUV's current agreement and 
voting timeline will be directly communicated to Southwest Airlines' members by TWU 555. 
2. In July, revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) rose in double digits, i.e., 12.5% on a year-over-year 
basis at CPA. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In July, available seat miles (a measure 
of capacity) increased 9.9% year over year. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor 
(percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved to 89% from 87% in July 2022. 
Copa Holdings was also in the news when it reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues for 
second-quarter 2023. The news was covered in the previous week's write up[4]. 
3. According to aReuters report[5], Irish carrierRyanair Holdingsexpects to carry more passengers in August than 
the actual figure in July. We remind investors that Ryanair carried 18.7 million passengers in July, which itself is a 
record. The load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) in July was as high as 96%. 
Per Eddie Wilson, the head of Ryanair DAC, the largest airline in the group, "It should be slightly more (than July) ... 
people are still travelling." Healthy booking trends have resulted in the upbeat expectation. Ryanair has been 
benefiting from the stronger-than-expected recovery in air travel demand from the pandemic lows. 
Currently, RYAAY carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here[6].

4. In a bid to meet the strong recovery in international travel in the post-pandemic scenario, Delta Air Lines DAL[7] 
has decided to expand its flight schedule to China. To this end, this Atlanta-based carrier has decided to operate 10 
weekly flights to the Shanghai-Pudong International Airport from its hubs in Seattle and Detroit hubs this winter. 
From Oct 29, the airline will operate daily flights from Shanghai and three-times-a-week flights from Detroit. 
Moreover, Delta intends to resume four-times-weekly flights to the Shanghai-Pudong International Airport from Los 
Angeles. DAL has not operated on the route since early 2020. 
According to a Reuters report[8], American Airlines AAL[9] has also decided to expand its China operations. The 
carrier has decided to commence daily flights from Dallas-Fort Worth to Shanghai-Pudong International Airport from 
January 2024.

Airlines object to Italy 's 'illegal' flight price cap

EUROPEAN airlines have called on the European Commission to intervene in a feud with Italian Prime Minister 
Georgia Meloni, over proposals to cap air fares on certain routes.
Last week, Meloni's populist government announced plans to cap the price of tickets between the mainland and 
Sardinia and Sicily during peak periods at 200 per cent of the average annual price.
In a letter seen by the Financial Times, trade body Airlines for Europe (A4E) said that Brussels must "clarify with 
Italy that this intervention impacts the free and deregulated air transport market in Europe".
A4E's managing director Ourania Georgoutsakou said airlines were "strongly concerned" that should the law be 
adopted, "it could set a precedent and lead to a domino effect resulting in similar regulations being adopted in other 
EU member states".
The changes, he argued, would "violate" the right of airlines "to compete wherever possible, set prices and define 
services as they see fit".
Major European carriers have strongly objected to the proposals, with A4E representing the likes of Easyjet and 
Ryanair.
Ryanair's CEO Eddie Wilson slammed the decision to "unlawfully interfere on how airlines set prices for airfares", 
arguing it would "reduce capacity, halt route development, take winter connectivity away and will raise prices for all 
passengers flying from the Islands to the Italian mainland".
Airlines object to Italy 's 'illegal' flight price cap
The Dublin-based carrier claims the plans are "illegal" under current European Union law and could cause future air 
fare hikes as a result of a reduction in the number of flights.
Wizz Air, which is not a member of A4E, confirmed to City A.M. that they had also raised concerns with the 
European Commission yesterday.
"Our strong view is that the proposed plan is contrary to the principle of pricing freedom, which is entrenched in EU 
law," a spokesperson said.
"Ultimately, we don't believe that the decree will achieve what the Italian government intends - which is the 
reduction of high fares."
Amid booming post-pandemic demand this year, the sector has faced criticism over rising ticket prices. Industry 
body IATA said it expects fares to keep rising for the next 10 to 15 years/ The European Commission was 
contacted for comment.
It came just days after a proposed windfall tax on banks' bumper profits sent shares in a host of European lenders 
plummeting, in a separate row between the Italian premier and the business world.

(ANSA) - AUG 16 - Airlines have asked the European Commission to intervene in relation to plans by the Italian 
government to cap air fares on certain domestic routes, according to an article published by the Financial Times on 
Tuesday. In a letter seen by the London newspaper the trade body Airlines for Europe (A4E) has called on Brussels 
"to clarify with Italy that this intervention impacts the free and deregulated air transport market in Europe". Last 
week the government of Premier Giorgia Meloni approved a decree setting a ceiling on the prices of flights to the 
Italian island regions of Sicily and Sardinia. However, A4E argues that this could "set a precedent and lead to a 
domino effect". Limiting fares would "violate" the rights of companies to '"compete wherever possible, set prices and 
define services as they see fit", the trade body added. 
Ryanair CEO Eddie Wilson has already blasted the measure clamping down on the use of algorithms to set flight 
prices, calling for it to be scrapped. "It's ridiculous, illegal and interferes with the free market, according to European 
law," Wilson told ANSA last Wednesday. "It must be cancelled. "If it isn't, there will be an impact on Ryanair's ability 
to operate in Italy," he added. The government has blamed the algorithms for soaring prices in recent months, 
especially for services connecting the mainland to Sicily and Sardinia in the absence of alternative road or rail links. 
The decree bans the algorithms if applied to connections to Sicily and Sardinia; if applied to peaks in demand linked 
to seasonal factors; and if they lead to the price of tickets or accessory services being 200% higher than the 
average price. "It's a public relations stunt, the stuff of populism," said Wilson. "They tried it in Moscow in 1917," he 
added.

(ANSA) - AUG 16 - Italy's proposed cap on air fares is in line with European Union norms and is not a breach of 
free-market rules as claimed by European airlines who have asked the European Commission to intervene in the 
matter, Italy's transport ministry said Wednesday. "The measures introduced by the Ministry of Enterprise and Made 
in Italy (against the high cost of flights) are fully in line with European directives on the protection of consumers in 
the face of speculative phenomena, or in any case distortions of the market, such as those reported in recent 
months by the controlling authorities for some air routes", said ministry sources. They added that "the ministry has 
all the elements needed to respond, in a complete manner, to any requests from the European Commission as is 
customary through its own offices". Airlines have asked the European Commission to intervene in relation to plans 
by the Italian government to cap air fares on certain domestic routes, according to an article published by the

Airlines have called on Brussels to step into a row over Giorgia Meloni's plan to cap air fares on some routes, as the 
Italian prime minister came under pressure from within her coalition to water down further a windfall tax on banks. In 
addition to the windfall tax on banks, Meloni's rightwing government last week outlined plans for price caps on 
flights between mainland Italy and its islands of Sicily and Sardinia after ticket prices rose 70 per cent on those 
routes.
Airlines responded furiously to Meloni's proposals, which represent an unusual attempt to cap fares.
Trade body Airlines for Europe (A4E) called on Brussels "to clarify with Italy that this intervention impacts the free 
and deregulated air transport market in Europe", according to a letter seen by the Financial Times.

in similar regulations being adopted in other EU member states," A4E managing director Ourania Georgoutsakou 
wrote. Capping fares on these routes would "violate" the rights of airlines "to compete wherever possible, set prices 
and define services as they see fit".
Unease in Meloni's coalition over clashes with the corporate world deepened yesterday when Antonio Tajani, 
deputy prime minister, called for the bank windfall tax to be watered down further. Tajani, who also serves as 
foreign minister and leads the Forza Italia party, said in an interview yesterday that the windfall tax should not apply 
to the country's smaller lenders.

He told Naples-based daily Il Mattino that he wanted the government to apply the levy only on the incomes of larger 
lenders that are overseen by the European Central Bank. "The main thing we are asking for is for the banks that 
aren't under the ECB's [supervision] to be excluded from the tax."
Tajani's attempt to distance himself from the levy comes after Meloni said she took "full responsibility" for the tax, 
which will apply to net interest income. Tajani said: "I understand the prime minister's [position] but we [Forza Italia] 
won't change our mind."
Under the separate airfare plan, prices during the high season would be capped at 200 per cent of the average 
while the use of "profiling algorithms" that might affect prices would be limited, according to a statement from the 
prime minister's office.
Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, described Italy's plans as "illegal" under EU law. The low-cost carrier said the 
intervention would "have unintended consequences" of raising air fares in the long run by reducing flight and 
passenger numbers.
The commission said last week it was seeking clarification from Rome, adding that price capping was rarely an 
effective means of achieving affordable prices. The commission said this week it would "assess the compatibility 
with EU law of any measure taken".
Italian officials have blamed the media for "inflating" the issue and said it was normal for the government to make 
sure prices did not rise excessively between the mainland and its islands. People close to industry minister Adolfo 
Urso said the measures were "in line with European law".
Airlines have long argued that the liberalisation of the European skies has benefited passengers by increasing 
connectivity and largely driving down air fares through competition.
Yet ticket prices have risen sharply - by as much as 30 per cent across Europe this year, according to estimates by 
airports - as companies cash in on booming demand for leisure travel after the Covid-19 pandemic amid a shortage 
of aircraft and rising labour and fuel costs.
Italian officials said Urso would meet airline representatives and industry associations to discuss the matter in 
September.

addition to the windfall tax on banks, Meloni's rightwing government last week outlined plans for price caps on 
flights between mainland Italy and its islands of Sicily and Sardinia after ticket prices rose 70 per cent on those 
routes.
Airlines responded furiously to Meloni's proposals, which represent an unusual attempt to cap fares.
Trade body Airlines for Europe (A4E) called on Brussels "to clarify with Italy that this intervention impacts the free 
and deregulated air transport market in Europe", according to a letter seen by the Financial Times.
"We are strongly concerned that if this law is adopted, it could set a precedent and lead to a domino effect resulting 
in similar regulations being adopted in other EU member states," A4E managing director Ourania Georgoutsakou 
wrote. Capping fares on these routes would "violate" the rights of airlines "to compete wherever possible, set prices 
and define services as they see fit".
Unease in Meloni's coalition over clashes with the corporate world deepened yesterday when Antonio Tajani, 
deputy prime minister, called for the bank windfall tax to be watered down further. Tajani, who also serves as 
foreign minister and leads the Forza Italia party, said in an interview yesterday that the windfall tax should not apply 
to the country's smaller lenders.
Airlines appeal to Brussels over Italy plan on capping fares; Corporate clash
He told Naples-based daily Il Mattino that he wanted the government to apply the levy only on the incomes of larger 
lenders that are overseen by the European Central Bank. "The main thing we are asking for is for the banks that 
aren't under the ECB's [supervision] to be excluded from the tax."
Tajani's attempt to distance himself from the levy comes after Meloni said she took "full responsibility" for the tax, 
which will apply to net interest income. Tajani said: "I understand the prime minister's [position] but we [Forza Italia] 
won't change our mind."
Under the separate airfare plan, prices during the high season would be capped at 200 per cent of the average 
while the use of "profiling algorithms" that might affect prices would be limited, according to a statement from the 
prime minister's office.
Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, described Italy's plans as "illegal" under EU law. The low-cost carrier said the 
intervention would "have unintended consequences" of raising air fares in the long run by reducing flight and 
passenger numbers.
The commission said last week it was seeking clarification from Rome, adding that price capping was rarely an 
effective means of achieving affordable prices. The commission said this week it would "assess the compatibility 
with EU law of any measure taken".
Italian officials have blamed the media for "inflating" the issue and said it was normal for the government to make 
sure prices did not rise excessively between the mainland and its islands. People close to industry minister Adolfo 
Urso said the measures were "in line with European law".
Airlines have long argued that the liberalisation of the European skies has benefited passengers by increasing 
connectivity and largely driving down air fares through competition.
Yet ticket prices have risen sharply - by as much as 30 per cent across Europe this year, according to estimates by 
airports - as companies cash in on booming demand for leisure travel after the Covid-19 pandemic amid a shortage 
of aircraft and rising labour and fuel costs.
Italian officials said Urso would meet airline representatives and industry associations to discuss the matter in 
September.

An elderly couple have described how they were left 'flustered and upset' after being charged 110 by Ryanair for 
printing incorrect boarding passes.
Ruth Jaffe, 79, and Peter Jaffe, 80, were forced to pay the fee after they 'accidentally downloaded their return 
boarding passes instead of the outgoing ones for a flight to France', reported The Guardian .The couple told BBC 
Radio 4's 'Today' programme that the airline's 'confusing' website design had led to the error.

SEE MORE How greater online regulation is prompting fears of a 'splinternet'
Ryanair faced a backlash on social media after the couple's daughter posted on Twitter about how her parents had 
been charged 55 each by the airline for new boarding cards following their'honest mistake'. She added: '110 for 2 
pieces of paper which took 1 minute. Shame on you [Ryanair].'
The airline said the charges were in line with its policy, but the row has shone a spotlight on the predicament of 
many elderly people struggling to navigate an increasingly digitised and online world.
'Less likely to use the internet'
Mrs Jaffe told the BBC that 'if you're elderly and you haven't been brought up using computers from day one, it can 
be very difficult'.
'I think there's such a number of people of my generation who will be having problems, that there's got to be some 
means of catering for them. Not everybody can go out and buy computers and suddenly become computer savvy,' 
she said.
And the issue isn't limited only to travel. The Telegraph  reported in May that Marks & Spencer had been accused 
of 'snubbing' its older customers by introducing touchscreens for ordering in its new automated 'digital M&S cafes'. 
Ryanair row: has digital revolution left elderly behind?
And The Express  warned earlier this month that older people could be paying more for goods and services 
'because they are less likely to use the internet'.
More older people becoming tech savvy
But the number of older people who do use technology is growing - in the US at least - according to research from 
the Pew Research Center . The use of smartphones among people aged 65 and over increased from 13% in 2012 
to 61% in 2021, the study found. And the number of older people using technology such as tablets has gone up 
since 2018, from 38% to 44%.
Yet many older people are being left isolated by an increasingly online world. One possible solution, said Wired , is 
for countries to follow the lead of New Zealand, which in 2019 published a digital inclusion blueprint. While it's 'still 
in its early days' the strategy has done much to encourage 'marginalised communities to get online, discovering the 
barriers they face in adopting technology and working to overcome them'.
On this front, however, the UK lags behind. In June, a House of Lords committee  criticised the UK government for 
not publishing a digital inclusion strategy since 2014, and warned that digital exclusion is a key factor in hindering 
the nation's ambition to become a 'technology superpower.'

 Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY) is benefiting from the improvement in traffic from the pandemic-led slump. 
Measures to expand its fleet and bring down debt levels are encouraging too. 
Against this backdrop, let's look at the factors that make this stock an attractive pick. What Makes RYAAY an 
Attractive Pick? An Outperformer: A glimpse at the company's price trend reveals that the stock has had an 
impressive run on the bourse year to date. Shares of RYAAY have gained 31.4% so far this year compared with the 
16.5% rise of the industry[1]it belongs to. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Solid Rank & VGM Score: RYAAY has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score[2]of A. Our research shows 
that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, offer the best 
investment opportunities. Thus, the company seems to be an appropriate investment proposition at the moment. 
Northward Estimate Revisions:The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to 
the price of a stock. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for RYAAY's second-quarter fiscal 2024 
earnings has moved up 28.72% year over year. 
Positive Earnings Surprise History: RYAAY has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company delivered an 
earnings surprise of 17.16% in the last four quarters, on average. 
Earnings Expectations: Earnings growth and stock price gains often indicate a company's prospects. For second-
quarter fiscal 2024, RYAAY's earnings are expected to grow 39.85% year over year. 
Growth Factors:An improvement in Ryanair's traffic from the pandemic-led slump is encouraging. The number of 
passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in July was 18.7 million, up 11% year over year. This compared favorably with 
the June 2023 figure of 17.4 million and the May 2023 figure of 17 million. Owing to upbeat traffic, the load factor 
was high at 96% in July 2023. The reading was similar to that reported a year ago. RYAAY operated more than 
102,000 flights in July 2023. 
On the back of the buoyant traffic scenario, RYAAY's profit after tax was €663 million in first-quarter fiscal 2024, up 
more than 100% year over year. Average fares in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were up 42%. Ryanair expects its 
traffic view for fiscal 2024 to be 183.5 million. Other Stocks to Consider Investors interested in the Zacks Airline[1] 
industry may also consider some top-ranked stocks likeUnited AirlinesUAL[3] andDelta Air LinesDAL[4]. UAL 
6 Reasons Why Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Should be in Your Portfolio
presently sports a Zacks Rank #1, while DAL carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can seethe complete list of 
today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[5]. 
United Airlines is seeing a steady recovery in domestic and international air-travel demand. Owing to this, UAL 
expects revenues for the September quarter to grow 10-13% year over year. Our third-quarter total revenue 
estimate hints at an increase of 11.4% year over year. 
For third-quarter 2023, United Airlines anticipates capacity to improve 16% from the year-ago reported figure. The 
Zacks Consensus Estimate for UAL's current-year earnings has been revised 19.7% upward over the past 60 days. 
Improved air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front, is aiding Delta. Due to the positive, DAL reported 
better-than-expected earnings per share (EPS) and revenues in the second quarter of 2023. For third-quarter 2023, 
the company expects EPS in the range of $2.2-$2.5. 
Management also raised its EPS outlook for the current year. The company now anticipates 2023 EPS (on an 
adjusted basis) in the band of $6-$7 (previous view: $6 per share). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DAL's 
current-year earnings has been revised 23.5% upward over the past 60 days.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) is expecting to beat its highest-ever monthly passenger figures once again in 
August, having previously set the record in July.
According to Ryanair DAC boss Eddie Wilson, the Irish budget airline should "slightly" outdo the 18.7 million 
passengers carried in July, which sat 26% higher than pre-pandemic figures.
"People are still travelling," Wilson said, tipping August should see more people travel with the airline than in July.
This would mark the fourth month in a row in which Ryanair surpasses its own monthly record passenger tally.
According to Wilson, the airline is not experiencing any "unusual" booking trends either, with the growth "indicating 
[...] that the booking curve is going to fill out exactly as predicted," thanks to a booming recovery for global aviation 
following the pandemic.
Ryanair had reduced its full-year passenger guidance from 185 million to 183.5 million last month in light of air 
traffic control strikes and potential disruption to Boeing aircraft deliveries.
However, Wilson confirmed that Ryanair's orders for the summer had now been filled, adding the airline was not 
expecting to be hit by supply issues in the near future.
Shares fell 1% to (EURO)15.73 on Tuesday.

Belgian pilots strike as Ryanair plans to ditch labour agreement
Belgian pilots strike as Ryanair plans to ditch labour agreement

Highlight: Belgium-based Ryanair pilots scheduled strike action across August 14 and 15, affecting more than 80 
flights and leading to a large backlog and disruptions lasting hours.
Body
The industrial action is based at Ryanair's Brussels hub, at Charleroi. According to the Belgium Cockpit Association 
(BeCA), Ryanair's announcement to put an end to the CLA agreement on October 1 2023 was the "tip of the 
Ryanair iceberg" and effectively led to the disputes piling up. The union argued this move would be illegal under 
Belgian law. 
Ryanair signed a collective labour agreement (CLA) in October 2018. This guaranteed pilots working hours and rest 
rhythms, and other locally inshrined labour rights. The airline contested that the action was triggered by a pay 
dispute, and said it "serves no purpose." "Ryanair Belgian pilots' union has already been offered the same pay deal 
as recently agreed by most other Ryanair pilots' unions across the EU so these limited strikes serve no purpose," 
the airline said in a brief statement. A joint letter from BeCA and other unions urged Belgian Prime Minister 
Alexander De Croo to take collective action on Ryanair, which stated: "For several years now, we have denounced 
Ryanair's failure to comply with Belgian legislation in matters of social law and labour law. "Our union organised 
several strikes in 2018, after which Ryanair pledged to follow these laws. However, five years later, the company 
Ryanair is going back to its faults and is now contesting the legitimacy of these laws." Since this time, conflicts 
between its pilots based in Belgium and Ryanair management have continued to grow. In March 2020, the pilots 
agreed to a 20% pay cut to help the airline deal with Covid-19 disruptions, a pay cut that is still in effect today. 
Simultaneously, despite the company's return to significant earnings, that being (EURO)1.43bn ($1.56bn) in profits 
after tax this year, Ryanair management refused to open discussions on restoring pay. In a statement, Ryanair 
called the industrial action "limited" and claimed 75% of its Belgian flights would be unaffected. This low-impact 
forecast by the low-cost airline is based on claims that the majority of its flights to and from Belgium will be handled 
by aircraft based outside of Belgium or by Charleroi-based aircraft manned by personnel who oppose the strikes.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) expects to post a new monthly record for passenger traffic in August amid the ongoing post-
COVID-19 recovery in the travel sector, Reuters reported Monday, citing Ryanair DAC's Head Eddie Wilson.
The August passenger figures are anticipated to be "slightly" above the record 18.7 million passengers in July since 
"people are still traveling," Wilson said. For September and October, the Irish low-cost airline expects booking 
developments to be in line with expectations. 
For the year ending March 31, 2024, Ryanair expects to fly a total of 183.5 million passengers, reflecting a 9% 
annual increase. The guidance was lowered from the previous forecast of 185 million passengers amid aircraft 
delivery delays.
Ryanair marginally rose on Monday's close.

AerCap Holdings NV (
AER ,  Financial ) is the global leader in aircraft leasing. The company acquires commercial aircraft and leases 
them to its airline customers worldwide. Its portfolio consists of more than 1,700 owned, managed and on order 
aircraft, with ~300 customers in 80 countries. AerCap's fleet consists of a mix of narrow-body and wide-body 
aircraft, engines, and materials.
Acquisitions and Revenue
Over the years, AerCap has made various acquisitions to expand its portfolio and footprint in the industry. One of 
the notable ones was the acquisition of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) from American International 
Group (AIG) in 2014 and GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) in 2021, making it by far the largest aircraft lessor 
globally. All of this generated $7.2 billion in revenue over the last twelve months and is served by just 641 
employees. That's over $11 million per employee on the top line and $2.9 million on the bottom line.
Global Customers
The United States and China together account for around half of AerCap's business . The global nature of its 
customer base provides diversification, but global tensions could impact future revenues, which could make it hard 
to pay debts and operate profitably.
In the United States, AerCap leases aircraft to many major airlines including American, Delta, United, Southwest 
and others. The US accounts for the largest share of AerCap's lease revenue. In China, AerCap has major airline 
customers such as China Southern, Hainan Airlines and Xiamen Airlines. China is AerCap's second largest market.
Other Key Markets
The other key markets include India, Australia, Japan, Thailand and Indonesia with major airline customers include 
Air India, Qantas, ANA, AirAsia and Garuda. Leading European airline customers include Lufthansa, International 
Airlines Group, Air France-KLM and Ryanair. Europe accounts for around 20% of AerCap's lease revenue with 
Latin American bringing in the rest with leases going to LATAM, Avianca and Azul Airlines among others.
Risk Reward with AerCap Holdings
The Aircraft Leasing Industry
Overall, by facilitating the needs of airline fleet, the air leasing industry plays an indispensable role in broadly 
supporting global air travel and mobility at competitive prices. It enables the world's aviation infrastructure.
For the air industry as a whole, it's been a wild ride as
Warren Buffett  ( Trades , Portfolio ) could tell you.
"The airline business from the time of Wilbur and Orville Wright through 1991 made zero money, net. If capitalists 
had been present at Kitty Hawk when the Wright brothers' plane first took off, they should have shot it down."
Fast forward to 2017, and Buffett has this to say.
'I like airlines because they just got a bad century out of the way. I think there have been almost 100 airline 
bankruptcies. I mean, that is a lot,' he said. 'It's been a disaster for capital.'
Impact of COVID-19 on the Industry
The aviation industry, including aircraft leasing companies like AerCap, faced significant headwinds due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Travel restrictions and a downturn in demand for air travel severely impacted airlines, which 
in turn affected lessors. However, as air travel began its recovery, leasing companies played a crucial role in 
helping airlines manage their fleets and financial health.
Leasing companies purchase planes from manufacturers and lease them out to airlines, providing carriers access 
without huge capital outlays. This allows airlines to expand and contract their fleets based on demand, rather than 
be stuck with owned planes. Lessors upgrade their portfolios regularly, enabling airlines to operate new, more fuel 
efficient aircraft. This benefits flyers. From a financial standpoint, airlines can tap into leasing company's large 
capital reserves and financing capacity to fund growth. Leasing enables airlines to concentrate on competing and 
providing air transportation services and by supporting airline profitability and efficiency, leasing helps enable lower 
ticket prices.
AerCap's Competitive Advantages
Aircraft are expensive assets. Starting an aircraft leasing company requires significant capital to purchase planes 
and maintain them. Financing can also be challenging, especially as new companies do not have a proven track 
record in the industry. The aviation industry is known for its cyclicality, influenced by global economic conditions, 
geopolitical events, fuel prices, and other factors. New entrants need to be prepared to navigate downturns and 
understand the industry's complex dynamics.
With 50+ years in the business, AerCap has cultivated close relationships and partnerships with airlines across the 
globe. This helps win lease deals. AerCap has built solid relationships with leading aircraft manufacturers like 
Boeing and Airbus. This ensures that they have access to the latest aircraft models and can secure favorable 
pricing and delivery slots. AerCap has one of the largest and most diverse fleets in the aircraft leasing industry. This 
scale allows them to serve a wide range of airline customers around the world and offers flexibility in lease terms, 
fleet management, and servicing various market needs.
Additional Services
In addition to leasing, AerCap offers services like aircraft management and sales, providing a holistic solution to 
airlines and enhancing customer stickiness. Understanding the intricacies of different aircraft types, their 
performance metrics, fuel efficiency, and suitability for various airline routes and demands is crucial. In other words, 
it's really hard for any company to compete with AerCap, much less a new one entering the industry.
Addressing AerCap's Debt Situation
Risk Reward with AerCap Holdings
The $46 billion in debt could crush shareholders in the end, but only time will tell. The massive hurdles to entry 
including high capital requirements, regulatory barriers, technical expertise, and relationships make new entrants 
rare to this market. That's good news when talking about longevity.
Despite a sizable amount of net debt, the company has around $19 billion worth of liquidity  and 1.4x coverage for 
the next twelve months with secured debt to total assets of 14%. The company's attractive long lease terms lead to 
stable and predictable revenues and cash flows, which are the norm for this kind of business. Aircrafts are not 
cheap, but they are necessary to modern life. The biggest risks come from technological innovation that would 
make air travel unnecessary. Thus, it's not likely that humans will stop flying around the planet. As long as it's 
profitable for AerCap and its clients, then the symbiotic relationship will continue.
Future Potential of AerCap
AerCap Holdings NV (
AER ,  Financial ) is showing promising progress on the financial front. The acquisition of GE Capital Aviation 
Services (GECAS) has significantly boosted its revenue streams despite the major debt load it came with. It's 
almost assured that more aircraft will take to the skies, which means there will continue to be a surge in 
maintenance rents and other income. End-of-lease incomes have gone up at AerCap and asset sales are thriving 
because of increased transactions and a more advantageous mix of assets.
From a financial standpoint, the $46 billion in long-term debt will have to be paid down; however, the interest rate 
was likely very favorable versus what is available today. That means any competitor would probably need to spend 
a lot more to get similar results. The company's profitability is also on an upward trajectory. The surge in lease 
agreements has positively impacted operating leverage. Although there's been a nominal rise in selling, general, 
and administrative expenses, their proportion in relation to lease incomes has seen a decrease. AerCap generates 
over $5 billion in cash from operations on 56% gross margins, pushing 25% of top line revenue to the bottom line. 
That puts earnings per share in the $7.50 to $8.00 range for each of the next couple of years.
The bottom line is that AerCap is a solid business that will be around in 20 years and will likely be more profitable 
than it is today.

AerCap Holdings NV (
AER ,  Financial ) is the global leader in aircraft leasing. The company acquires commercial aircraft and leases 
them to its airline customers worldwide. Its portfolio consists of more than 1,700 owned, managed and on order 
aircraft, with approximately 300 customers in 80 countries. AerCap's fleet consists of a mix of narrow-body and 
wide-body aircraft, engines and materials.
Acquisitions and revenue
Over the years, AerCap has made various acquisitions to expand its portfolio and footprint in the industry. One of 
the notable ones was the acquisition of International Lease Finance Corp. from American International Group (
AIG ,  Financial ) in 2014 and GE Capital Aviation Services in 2021, making it by far the largest aircraft lessor 
globally. All of this generated $7.2 billion in revenue over the last 12 months and is served by just 641 employees. 
That's over $11 million per employee on the top line and $2.9 million on the bottom line.
Global customers
The United States and China together account for around half of AerCap's business. The global nature of its 
customer base provides diversification, but global tensions could impact future revenues, which could make it hard 
to pay debts and operate profitably.
In the U.S., AerCap leases aircraft to many major airlines, including American (
AAL ,  Financial ), Delta (  DAL  ,  Financial ), United (  UAL  ,  Financial ), Southwest (  LUV  ,  Financial ) and 
others. The U.S. accounts for the largest share of the company's lease revenue. In China, AerCap has major airline 
customers such as China Southern, Hainan Airlines and Xiamen Airlines. China is its second-largest market.
The other key markets include India, Australia, Japan, Thailand and Indonesia with major airline customers like Air 
India, Qantas, ANA, AirAsia and Garuda. Leading European airline customers include Lufthansa, International 
A Closer Look at AerCap Holdings
Airlines Group, Air France-KLM and Ryanair. Europe accounts for around 20% of AerCap's lease revenue, with 
Latin American bringing in the rest with leases going to LATAM, Avianca and Azul Airlines, among others.
The aircraft leasing industry
Overall, by facilitating the needs of airline fleet, the air leasing industry plays an indispensable role in broadly 
supporting global air travel and mobility at competitive prices. It enables the world's aviation infrastructure.
For the air industry as a whole, it has been a wild ride as
Warren Buffett  ( Trades , Portfolio ) could tell you.
"The airline business from the time of Wilbur and Orville Wright through 1991 made zero money, net. If capitalists 
had been present at Kitty Hawk when the Wright brothers' plane first took off, they should have shot it down."
Fast forward to 2017, and Buffett has this to say:
'I like airlines because they just got a bad century out of the way. I think there have been almost 100 airline 
bankruptcies. I mean, that is a lot,' he said. 'It's been a disaster for capital.'
Impact of Covid-19 on the industry
The aviation industry, including aircraft leasing companies like AerCap, faced significant headwinds due to the 
Covid-19 pandemic. Travel restrictions and a downturn in demand for air travel severely impacted airlines, which in 
turn affected lessors. However, as air travel began its recovery, leasing companies played a crucial role in helping 
airlines manage their fleets and financial health.
Leasing companies purchase planes from manufacturers and lease them out to airlines, providing carriers access 
without huge capital outlays. This allows airlines to expand and contract their fleets based on demand, rather than 
be stuck with owned planes. Lessors upgrade their portfolios regularly, enabling airlines to operate new, more fuel-
efficient aircraft. This benefits flyers. From a financial standpoint, airlines can tap into leasing company's large 
capital reserves and financing capacity to fund growth. Leasing enables airlines to concentrate on competing and 
providing air transportation services and by supporting airline profitability and efficiency, leasing helps enable lower 
ticket prices.
Competitive advantages
Aircraft are expensive assets. Starting an aircraft leasing company requires significant capital to purchase planes 
and maintain them. Financing can also be challenging, especially as new companies do not have a proven track 
record in the industry. The aviation industry is known for its cyclicality, influenced by global economic conditions, 
geopolitical events, fuel prices and other factors. New entrants need to be prepared to navigate downturns and 
understand the industry's complex dynamics.
With 50-plus years in the business, AerCap has cultivated close relationships and partnerships with airlines across 
the globe. This helps win lease deals. The company has built solid relationships with leading aircraft manufacturers 
like Boeing (
BA ,  Financial ) and Airbus (  XPAR:AIR  ,  Financial ). This ensures it has access to the latest aircraft models and 
can secure favorable pricing and delivery slots. AerCap has one of the largest and most diverse fleets in the aircraft 
leasing industry. This scale allows it to serve a wide range of airline customers around the world and offers flexibility 
in lease terms, fleet management and servicing various market needs.
In addition to leasing, AerCap offers services like aircraft management and sales, providing a holistic solution to 
airlines and enhancing customer stickiness. Understanding the intricacies of different aircraft types, their 
performance metrics, fuel efficiency and suitability for various airline routes and demands is crucial. In other words, 
it's really hard for any company to compete with AerCap, much less a new one entering the industry.
A Closer Look at AerCap Holdings
Addressing the debt situation
The $46 billion in debt could crush shareholders in the end, but only time will tell. The massive hurdles to entry, 
including high capital requirements, regulatory barriers, technical expertise and relationships, make new entrants 
rare to this market. That's good news when talking about longevity.
Despite a sizable amount of net debt, the company has around $19 billion worth of liquidity and 1.4 times coverage 
for the next 12 months with secured debt to total assets of 14%. The company's attractive long lease terms lead to 
stable and predictable revenues and cash flows, which are the norm for this kind of business. Aircraft are not 
cheap, but they are necessary to modern life. The biggest risks come from technological innovation that would 
make air travel unnecessary. Thus, it's not likely that humans will stop flying around the planet. As long as it's 
profitable for AerCap and its clients, then the symbiotic relationship will continue.
Potential
AerCap is showing promising progress on the financial front. The acquisition of GE Capital Aviation Services has 
significantly boosted its revenue streams despite the major debt load it came with. It's almost assured that more 
aircraft will take to the skies, which means there will continue to be a surge in maintenance rents and other income. 
End-of-lease incomes have gone up at AerCap and asset sales are thriving because of increased transactions and 
a more advantageous mix of assets.
From a financial standpoint, the $46 billion in long-term debt will have to be paid down; however, the interest rate 
was likely very favorable versus what is available today. That means any competitor would probably need to spend 
a lot more to get similar results. The company's profitability is also on an upward trajectory. The surge in lease 
agreements has positively impacted operating leverage. Although there's been a nominal rise in selling, general 
and administrative expenses, their proportion in relation to lease incomes has seen a decrease. AerCap generates 
over $5 billion in cash from operations on 56% gross margins, pushing 25% of top line revenue to the bottom line. 
That puts earnings per share in the $7.50 to $8 range for the next couple of years.
The bottom line is that AerCap is a solid business that will be around in 20 years and will likely be more profitable 
than it is today.

Aug 15, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 According to a Reuters report[1], Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[2] expects to carry more passengers in 
August than the actual figure in July. We remind investors that Ryanair carried 18.7 million passengers in July, 
which itself is a record. The load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) in July was as high as 96%. 
Per Eddie Wilson, the head of Ryanair DAC, the largest airline in the group, "It should be slightly more (than July) ... 
people are still travelling". Healthy booking trends have resulted in the upbeat expectation. 
Ryanair has been benefitting from the stronger-than-expected recovery in air travel demand from the pandemic 
lows. While passenger volumes continue to be strong, what is all the more encouraging is the strong bounce back 
of international travel. 
Ryanair expects its traffic for fiscal 2024 to be 183.5 million. In spite of upbeat passenger volumes, RYAAY 
continues to be hurt due to headwinds like air traffic control strikes and potential further Boeing delivery delays. Due 
to the challenges, management trimmed its fiscal 2024 traffic forecast to 183.5 million from 185 million. Zacks Rank 
& Stocks to Consider Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Investors interested in the Zacks Airline[3] 
industry may also consider stocks likeUnited AirlinesUAL[4] andDelta Air LinesDAL[5].While UAL sports a Zacks 
Rank #1 (Strong Buy), DAL carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 
Rank stocks here[6]. 
United Airlines is seeing steady recovery in domestic and international air-travel demand. Owing to this, UAL 
expects revenues for the September quarter to grow 10-13% year over year. Our third-quarter total revenue 
estimate hints at an increase of 11.4% year over year. 
For third-quarter 2023, United Airlines anticipates capacity to improve 16% from the year-ago reported figure. The 
Zacks Consensus Estimate for UAL's current-year earnings has been revised 19.7% upward over the past 60 days. 
Improved air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front, is aiding Delta. Due to the positive, DAL reported 
better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in second-quarter 2023. Third-quarter earnings are forecast 
in the range of $2.2-$2. 5 per share. 
Management raised its earnings per share outlook for the current year. The company now estimates 2023 earnings 
(on an adjusted basis) in the band of $6-$7 per share (previous view: $6 per share). The Zacks Consensus 
Estimate for DAL's current-year earnings has been revised 23.5% upward over the past 60 days.

RyanAir expects record August traffic
4:30pm: FTSE 100 closes just above 7,500
London's blue-chip benchmark finished Monday's trading some 17 points or 0.23% lower, marking the close at 
7,507.
3.56pm: RyanAir expects record August traffic
Ryanair expects traffic in August to "slightly" beat its record ever numbers - achieved last month - as it proves to be 
a major beneficiary of the surging demand for travel.
Passenger numbers will surpass the record 18.7m passengers it flew in July, with bookings for September and 
October so far coming in exactly as expected, a senior executive told Reuters on Monday.
Eddie Wilson, the head of Ryanair DAC, the largest airline in the group, said:
It should be slightly more ... people are still travelling.
The airline last month reported that its profits had quadrupled since the spring, although chief executive Michael 
O'Leary has said prices may need to fall in the winter.
3.15pm: CVC revives float plans - FT
FTSE 100 Live: Stocks off lows but Chinese property concerns weigh
One of Europe's biggest buyout groups, CVC Capital Partners, has revived plans for a multibillion-euro stock 
market listing that could come before the end of the year, according to people familiar with the matter.
The Financial Times has the newsreporting the secretive firm, which owns the maker of PG Tips tea and has made 
major bets on rugby and Formula One, pushed back a planned listing last year as markets plummeted following 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
But a rebound in markets and the firm's raising of a record (EURO)26 billion buyout fund last month have made 
conditions look more favourable, the people said, according to the report.
However, they cautioned that no final decision has been taken and the plan could still change.
2.45pm: Mixed start across the pond
It was a mixed picture on Wall Street as stocks continued a sluggish start to August dented by concerns about the 
health of China's property sector.
Shortly after the opening bell, The Dow Jones Industrial Average had edged up 14.01 points at 35,295.41, the S&P 
500 was down 7.36 points, 0.2%, at 4,456.69 while the Nasdaq Composite was 52.97 points, 0.4% at 13,591.88.
Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and Forex.com said: "Concerns surrounding the perilous financial 
state of some of China's largest property developers and the nation's post pandemic economic struggles have 
dented investor sentiment."
Shares in Country Garden slumped to a record low on Monday after the Chinese property developer suspended 
trading in at least 10 of its mainland bonds.
The company, formerly the largest developer in China by sales, missed international bond payments last week and 
at the weekend said several bonds issued by the company and its subsidiaries would be suspended from trading 
this week.
Jennifer McKeown at Capital Economics said: "The immediate global economic and market fallout from troubles at 
Chinese property developer Country Garden seems likely to be limited."
"Foreign exposure to China's property sector has fallen sharply over recent years and policymakers should step in 
to prevent a meltdown in China."
"However, the developer's problems are indicative of a structural  downturn which will shape the global economy for 
years to come," she added.
Stocks on the move include US Steel Corp which 25% after the company rejected a takeover offer from 
peer Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE:CLF) (Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE:CLF)) and said it will instead start a review of 
its strategic options.
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) (Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)) slipped 3.0%, triggering a sell-off for other producers of 
electric vehicles, after it rolled out a new round of price cuts in China. Rivian Automotive fell 3.6% in response.
Elsewhere, retailers will be in the spotlight with retail sales figures tomorrow plus earnings from Home Depot, 
Target and Walmart.
2.05pm: Italy's PM takes full responsibility for windfall tax fiasco
Italy's prime minister Giorgia Meloni has taken "full responsibility" for last week's controversial decision to impose a 
one-off windfall tax on banks, which she described as her own.
"I would do it again because I believe that the right things must be done," she said in comments to Italy's three 
largest newspapers.
FTSE 100 Live: Stocks off lows but Chinese property concerns weigh
"This is a decision that I took on my own."
The unexpected announcement last week crippled the rightwing government's credibility with investors and sent 
shockwaves through financial markets.
Italian bank stocks lost up to 10% on the day the 40% tax on lenders' net interest income was announced.
Less than 24 hours later, the government was forced to partially backtrack, with the finance ministry announcing a 
cap on the levy that substantially watered down its effect on lenders' balance sheets
1.30pm: Here's a look at the risers and fallers on the junior end of the market today
Shares in the data group Glantus Holdings PLC (AIM:GLAN) shot up 65% after it agreed to be taken over by 
Finnish procurement specialist Basware in a £17.8 million deal.
The 33.42p per share offer tabled by Basware's bid vehicle represents a 67% premium to Friday's closing price.
Global Petroleum (AIM:GBP) rose 4.5% as the Namibian Ministry of Mines and Energy gave approval for its 
consortium to move to the first renewal period (FRP) of Walvis Basin licence PEL 94, with a duration of two years 
from September 2023 to September 2025.
Inspirit Energy Holdings PLC (LSE:INSP) shares dropped 16% to 0.019p in early Monday trading due to 
manufacturing errors identified in a key component of their Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) system.
During a test visit to its Polish facility, flaws were detected in a component crucial for the Helix Accelerator's drive. 
Shares have since recovered to 0.021p.
Serinus Energy PLC (AIM:SENX) fell 16% following the release of first-half results, which revealed the impact of 
falling oil prices on the producer.
The Jersey-based company, which has operations in Tunisia and Romania, saw its revenues drop to $8.9 million in 
the six months ended 30 June 2023, compared with $29.3 million during the same period in 2022.
1.00pm: Lok'n Store growth story "remains compelling" 
Lok'n Store Group PLC offers a growth opportunity that "remains compelling," according to Peel Hunt.
The broker was commenting after the self storage space provider updated the City on trading for the year to July 
31.
It noted 2023 self-storage revenue was up 5.3%, or 12.1% on a like-for-like basis, which looks "marginallt ahead of 
our own forecasts."
Peel Hunt plans on leaving its forecasts unchanged which means the shares sit on a circa 20% discount to adjusted 
net asset value and offer a dividend yield forecast to exceed 3%.
"In our view, the growth opportunity remains compelling," the broker added.
Shares rose 1.9% to 745.60p around Monday lunchtime.
12.33pm: Tourist tax knocks spending in London
Tourist spending in London has plunged due to the government's post-Brexit tourist tax, a survey has showed.
Tourists from the US and the Gulf region reduced their spending in the West End by 1% and 17%, respectively, in 
the three months to June compared with the same period in 2019, according to research by the New West End 
Company.
FTSE 100 Live: Stocks off lows but Chinese property concerns weigh
This is despite flight bookings from these regions rising by 17% and 7% against the second quarter of 2019.
During the same period, spending by American visitors rose by 183% in France and by 174% in Spain, with tourists 
from the Gulf spending 118% extra in France and 112% more in Italy.
The decision to end VAT-free shopping for visitors from outside the European Union after Brexit has prompted 
concern from several leading business figures. 
Kwasi Kwarteng promised to scrap the additional 20% tax on purchases last year when he was chancellor, but the 
decision was reversed by Jeremy Hunt, his successor.
12.03pm: Bright start to the week expected on Wall Street
The Nasdaq looks set to lead US markets higher at the open on Monday after making a sluggish start to August.
In pre-market trading, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were 0.2% higher, while those for the S&P 500 
rose 0.3%, and contracts for the Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.4%.
The tech-laden Nasdaq fell 1.9% last week taking its losing streak to two weeks for the first time this year.
Earnings this week will focus on the health of the consumer with results from the likes of Walmart, Target, and 
Home Depot. Today, there is a tech theme as CRM stock Monday.com releases second quarter earnings.
Aside from earnings the key release will be the latest Federal Open Market Committee minutes as investors look for 
clues as to Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates.
The Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged at its next meeting but investors will be closely 
monitoring the language in the minutes to gauge the tone towards future policy.
Concerns over the health of the Chinese property sector may limit gains after the country's biggest private property 
developer, Country Garden, said it would suspend trading in some bonds.
"A crisis in the Chinese real estate sector is a story the market has heard before and not one which has typically 
come with a happy ending for stocks," said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.
But for now, futures are indicating US markets are shrugging this development aside.
11.29am: Consumer confidence knocked by rising mortgage rates
Consumer confidence continues to decline as soaring mortgage rates hit household finances.
Confidence, which had been improving since the aftermath of the mini-Budget, slid for the second month in a row in 
July, according to polling by YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr).
Overall consumer confidence declined by 1.6 points last month, according to YouGov's poll of 6,000 people, falling 
to 100. The score means the nation is "neutral" on the economy, having previously been slightly optimistic.
The public have become more pessimistic about personal finances, house prices and the outlook for 
businesses since YouGov's last survey.
The shift in sentiment over recent months has coincided with a surge in mortgage rates that began at the end of 
May.
Kay Neufeld, head of forecasting at Cebr, said that "concerns about rising mortgage rates and wider housing cost 
pressures" were likely behind wobbling confidence.
11.03am: Rouble falls to 16-month low
FTSE 100 Live: Stocks off lows but Chinese property concerns weigh
The Russian rouble has fallen to a 16-month low against the dollar as a surge in Russian military spending and a 
collapse in export revenues add pressure to a currency suffering under western sanctions and an escalation of 
capital outflows. 
Russia's currency has lost about 25% of its value this year as the impact of the war with Ukraine continues to take 
its toll.
The decline has more than offset the rouble's rise last year when Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine was followed 
by a sharp increase in oil and gas prices.
The drop has accelerated in recent weeks, raising pressure on Moscow after western sanctions limited capital 
inflows and European countries weaned themselves off Russia's energy supplies, reducing the revenues it receives 
from oil sales.
10.23am: B&M could benefit from Wilko collapse - Deutsche
Better news for investors in B&M European Value Retail SA (LSE:BME) with shares top of the FTSE 100 risers 
after Deutsche Bank increased its share price target.
Analyst Adam Cochrane points out discount retailers have been a winning retail category over the last decade and 
B&M saw a step change in sales and profitability during Covid.
Margins have been raised despite FX headwinds and inflationary pressures while the Wilko administration offers 
further opportunity for B&M to take market share, he thinks.
This is in addition to an acceleration in the pace of new store openings in the UK and France.
"In our view, investors will focus on a company delivering a much higher ROCE, actively deploying capital into new 
store growth and returning cash to shareholders," Cochrane said.
He raised his share price target to 680p from 610p offering "c.25% upside potential in addition to an expected c.6-
7% dividend yield."
Cochrane reiterated a buy rating and shares rose 3.1% to 554.20p.
9.57am: Chinese property jitters keeps London lower
The jitters surroung China's property market continue to keep a lid on shares in London with the FTSE now down 
14 points.
Chinese property giant Country Garden's debt problems deepened after its onshore bonds were suspended, 
sending its shares plunging 16% to a record low on Monday.
 Country Garden's January 2024 dollar bond is yielding 2500%. Trading at 9 cents. Any takers?

"A crisis in the Chinese real estate sector is a story the market has heard before and not one which has typically 
come with a happy ending for stocks," says AJ Bell's Russ Mould.
"News China property giant Country Garden had missed bond payments as it racked up big losses was always 
likely to prompt selling in Asian markets and that's fed through to the European open.
"This latest calamity is reflective of a recovery which has not lived up to expectations since the world's second 
largest economy ditched zero-Covid measures at the end of last year."
"The one silver lining for the West may be a deflationary impact from China's woes which helps in the battle against 
inflation," he added.
FTSE 100 Live: Stocks off lows but Chinese property concerns weigh
9.32am: UK employers rasing pay to keep staff
It's a key week for UK data with inflation, unemployment and average earnings figures released this week.
A survey out today shows UK employers are expecting to continue raising pay for staff as they battle to retain 
people, even as the economy is expected to stutter.
Businesses expect to offer pay rises of up to 5% over the coming year, the highest level since 2012 and sustained 
from the last two quarters, according to the poll of 2,000 human resources executives by the Chartered Institute of 
Personnel and Development (CIPD), a professional body.
 Our latest Labour Market Outlook report for Summer 2023 is here ☀￿ The quarterly survey of 2,000 employers 
provides analysis on employers' recruitment, redundancy and pay intentions combined with unique insights on 
labour market topics ???? Many employers have hard-to-fill... pic.twitter.com/nle0rwhXdV - CIPD (@CIPD) August 
14, 2023
More employers also expect to try to retain staff who have said they want to leave with counteroffers - trying to beat 
offers from elsewhere with pay increases or other perks.
Around 40% of UK employers have made a counteroffer in the past 12 months, the CIPD said, while 38% of 
employers who made offers matched the salary of the new job offer and 40% offered even higher sums.
The findings suggest the UK labour market remains tight, with unemployment still near record lows at 4% in May, 
although it did increase more than expected from 3.8% in April.
8.55am: Miners drag the FTSE 100 lower
The FTSE 100 remains in the red with mining stocks holding equities back on the news coming out of China.
Susanah Streeter at Hargreaves Lansdown noted: "'Worries about deeper cracks appearing in the Chinese property 
sector kept the FTSE 100 on a losing streak in early trade, as concerns continue to swirl about the health of the 
world's second largest economy."
"Problems are piling up at real estate giant Country Garden, which not only warned of multibillion-dollar 
losses, but also missed key interest payments on its debt and is suspending trading on 11 of its onshore bonds."
Concerns over the health of the Chinese economy has been a theme of the past two weeks and the jitters 
surrounding the property sector in the world's second largest economy are just adding to the narrative.
Fallers in the lead index are led by Rio Tinto Ltd, closely followed by Anglo American, Fresnillo and Glencore PLC 
(LSE:GLEN).
Entain contines to lose ground after last week's worse-than-expected charge relating to a probe into its former 
Turkish business while a weak oil price weighs on BP PLC (LSE:BP.) and Shell PLC (LSE:SHEL, NYSE:SHEL).
Brent crude has slipped 0.8% to $86.10/barrel, again reflecting concerns over growth in China.
8.35am: YouGov mulls US listing - Financial Times
YouGov PLC (AIM:YOU), the UK-listed pollster and data analytics firm, is weighing up a US listing in what would be 
another blow to the London Stock Exchange, reports the Financial Times.
Stephan Shakespeare told the FT the group was considering moving its listing following a recent acquisition that 
has bolstered its operations. 
"I think the markets are better at supporting companies like ours there," he told the FT.
FTSE 100 Live: Stocks off lows but Chinese property concerns weigh
The US is the largest market for YouGov, where it works with US tech groups and consumer brands as well as 
providing detailed political coverage.
e said that the company could move its primary listing to the US or establish a secondary listing.
Shakespeare, with his family, owns about 8% of the company, which floated in London in 2005 and is valued at 
more than £1 billion
Shares in the firm were 0.2% hgher at 946p.
8.15am: FTSE follows Asia lower
The FTSE 100 has edged lower in early trading, after falls in Asian and US markets, with investors already looking 
ahead to inflation figures later this week.
At 8.15am, London's lead index was down 18.24 points, 0.2%, at 7,505.92 while the FTSE 250 fell 22.13, 0.1%, at 
18,777.57.
"The lead from other major markets left the UK with nowhere to go, although the losses were limited in opening 
exchanges," said Richard Hunter at interactive investor.
Asian markets slipped on concerns over the property sector while in the US on Friday stronger-than-expected 
wholesale price figures muddied the waters.
Wednesday's inflation data is expected to show the annual inflation rate fell to 6.7% in July, slightly lower than the 
Bank of England's 6.8% forecast, and a significant drop from 7.9% in June.
The core figure, excluding food and energy is expected to dip slightly to 6.8% in July from 6.9% in June.
On a quiet morning for company news, shares in Plus500 Ltd (LSE:PLUS) rose 1.3% after its half-year results.
Analysts at Liberum said: "Against a backdrop of calmer markets, Plus500 delivered a robust performance in 
1H23."
The broker highlighted "the strength of the business model, the high levels of cash generation that result, and 
management's commitment to maximising shareholder returns."
"The market continues to underappreciate (ignore?) and undervalue this," Liberum reckons.
YouGov PLC (AIM:YOU) was a touch firmer, up 0.7%, on reports it is mulling a US listing while B&M European 
Value Retail SA (LSE:BME), rose 1.7%, as Deutsche Bank raised its price target and reiterated a 'buy' rating.
The German investment bank increased its price target to 680p from 610p.
7.50am: Shaftesbury strikes £200 million loan deal with Aviva
Shaftesbury Capital PLC has struck a £200 million loan with Aviva Investors.
The FTSE 250 company said the agreement covered a 10-year period and was backed by a portfolio of assets 
within the Carnaby estate.
It said the newly-established facility would complement its existing secured term loans from Aviva Investors, valued 
at £130 million and £120 million and set to mature in 2030 and 2035, respectively.
The proceeds will be used to repay in part the £576 million unsecured loan which was drawn in April to fund the 
repayment of the Shaftesbury secured bonds.
7.39am: Plus 500 launches new buyback as earnings fall
FTSE 100 Live: Stocks off lows but Chinese property concerns weigh
It's a quiet morning for company news. But FTSE 250-listed Plus 500 has released half-year results to June 30.
The fintech group reported revenue of $368.5 million compared to $511.4 million the year before while Ebitda of 
$174.1 million was down from $305.3 million.
Ebidta margins fell to 47% from 60%.
The firm launched a $60.0 million buyback programme, comprising an interim buyback programme of $33.7 million 
and a special buyback programme of $26.3million.
Shareholders were further rewarded with an interim dividend of $0.4125 per share and a special dividend of 
$0.3219.
The company expects revenue and Ebitda for the current financial year to be in line with current market 
expectations.
7.03am: Subdued start seen in London afetr falls in Asia
It looks like a weak start to the week in London following falls in Asian markets over concerns of defaults in the 
Chinese property sector.
Spread betting companies are calling the FTSE 100 down by around 14 points after closing down 94.44 points at 
7,524.16 on Friday.
Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: "Asia markets have fallen sharply this morning as a sell-off on Chinese 
markets, amidst concern over defaults in its property sector, and broader economic weakness has prompted fears 
that this weakness could spread to other areas of the economy, after it was claimed that a Chinese trust company 
failed to make payments to some clients."
Shares in Chinese property giant Country Garden slumped around 16% after it missed bond payments and warned 
of multibillion-dollar losses, deepening concerns over the nation's heavily indebted real estate sector. 
In Asia, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo was down 1.2%. In China, the Shanghai Composite was down 0.9%, while 
the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was down 2.4%. 
Back to London, and it's a quiet start to the week with results from CentralNic, Plus500, and Stelrad.

In an era of rapidly advancing technology, the travel industry stands on the brink of a transformative shift, with 
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) poised to revolutionize the way we explore the world. As travelers increasingly 
seek personalized and tailored experiences, Generative AI is emerging as a powerful tool to cater to these 
preferences, offering the potential to reshape travel recommendations and enhance the overall journey.
By harnessing the capabilities of AI, travel companies are on the verge of creating a new paradigm where every 
aspect of travel, from itinerary planning to accommodation choices, is uniquely tailored to individual preferences. 
This introduction delves into the profound impact of Generative AI on the travel industry, exploring how it is set to 
redefine personalization and elevate travel experiences to unprecedented heights.
A global survey conducted by Expedia Group, involving over 5,700 travelers, has revealed that the average traveler 
dedicates more than five hours to researching a trip, reviewing around 141 pages of content. For American 
travelers, the figure is even more substantial, averaging a staggering 277 pages. In response to this evolving 
landscape, generative artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a game-changing technology that aims to simplify 
and personalize the trip planning process. Travel companies are harnessing the power of AI to not only plan 
itineraries but also communicate with hotels, draft travel budgets, and even act as personalized travel assistants.
This transformation in the travel industry promises to revolutionize the way companies engage with travelers. 
Traditional travel search platforms, like Airbnb, are evolving with AI integration. For instance, Airbnb's CEO Brian 
Chesky envisions a future where AI builds a comprehensive profile of users, asking fundamental questions like 
"Who are you, and what do you want?" This shift signifies a departure from mere location-based queries to a more 
nuanced understanding of travelers' preferences.
Though AI-driven "personalization at scale" remains a work in progress, AI's capacity to process vast amounts of 
data, answer questions in natural language, and learn from previous interactions is gaining traction. This ability 
resonates across various industries, with travel being no exception.
While the survey conducted by the National Research Group indicates that 61% of respondents are open to using 
conversational AI for trip planning, only 6% have actually employed this technology. Concerns about data privacy 
(51%) and the accuracy of results (33%) are among the factors hindering widespread adoption.
Generative AI Set to Transform Travel Industry, Personalizing and Enhancing Experiences
Nevertheless, numerous travel giants are embracing AI technology:
Trip.com launched TripGen, an in-app chatbot powered by OpenAI.
Expedia, Kayak, and others adopted ChatGPT plugins for enhanced user interactions.
Expedia introduced an AI chatbot powered by ChatGPT.
Airbnb announced plans to integrate GPT-4 into its interface.
Amazon Web Services invested $100 million in generative AI programs, involving companies like RyanAir and 
Lonely Planet.
Booking.com introduced an AI-powered "Trip Planner" chatbot.
Priceline launched Trip Intelligence, featuring a Google-backed AI chatbot called "Penny."
Tripadvisor launched an AI-powered travel itinerary maker called Trips.
Trip.com unveiled an updated chatbot called TripGenie, enhancing text, voice, and multimedia responses.
HomeToGo beta launched "AI Mode" for in-app AI search functionality.
Travel planning is the initial application of AI in the travel industry, but companies are exploring further possibilities. 
Trip.com, for instance, is considering developing a virtual travel guide. The potential extends to predicting flight 
delays and addressing negative online reviews. The implementation of chatbots could potentially generate $1.9 
billion in value by optimizing customer service and allowing human staff to address complex issues. As per Skift's 
predictions, generative AI's impact on the travel industry could be a $28.5 billion opportunity, with conservative 
estimates likely to be surpassed as the technology's potential unfolds.

In an era of rapidly advancing technology, the travel industry stands on the brink of a transformative shift, with 
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) poised to revolutionize the way we explore the world. As travelers increasingly 
seek personalized and tailored experiences, Generative AI is emerging as a powerful tool to cater to these 
preferences, offering the potential to reshape travel recommendations and enhance the overall journey.
By harnessing the capabilities of AI, travel companies are on the verge of creating a new paradigm where every 
aspect of travel, from itinerary planning to accommodation choices, is uniquely tailored to individual preferences. 
This introduction delves into the profound impact of Generative AI on the travel industry, exploring how it is set to 
redefine personalization and elevate travel experiences to unprecedented heights.
A global survey conducted by Expedia Group, involving over 5,700 travelers, has revealed that the average traveler 
dedicates more than five hours to researching a trip, reviewing around 141 pages of content. For American 
travelers, the figure is even more substantial, averaging a staggering 277 pages. In response to this evolving 
landscape, generative artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a game-changing technology that aims to simplify 
and personalize the trip planning process. Travel companies are harnessing the power of AI to not only plan 
itineraries but also communicate with hotels, draft travel budgets, and even act as personalized travel assistants.
This transformation in the travel industry promises to revolutionize the way companies engage with travelers. 
Traditional travel search platforms, like Airbnb, are evolving with AI integration. For instance, Airbnb's CEO Brian 
Chesky envisions a future where AI builds a comprehensive profile of users, asking fundamental questions like 
"Who are you, and what do you want?" This shift signifies a departure from mere location-based queries to a more 
nuanced understanding of travelers' preferences.
Though AI-driven "personalization at scale" remains a work in progress, AI's capacity to process vast amounts of 
data, answer questions in natural language, and learn from previous interactions is gaining traction. This ability 
resonates across various industries, with travel being no exception.
While the survey conducted by the National Research Group indicates that 61% of respondents are open to using 
conversational AI for trip planning, only 6% have actually employed this technology. Concerns about data privacy 
(51%) and the accuracy of results (33%) are among the factors hindering widespread adoption.

Trip.com launched TripGen, an in-app chatbot powered by OpenAI.
Expedia, Kayak, and others adopted ChatGPT plugins for enhanced user interactions.

Belgian pilots staged their latest strike against Ryanair on Monday, forcing the Irish operator to cancel 88 flights 
through Charleroi, one of its busiest European hubs.
The strike, the third during this summer season, hit 15,000 travellers planning to fly on Monday or Tuesday, 
Belgium's mid-August Assumption Day public holiday, the airport said.
Pilots based in Belgium have accused Ryanair of failing to implement an agreement signed during the Covid-19 
pandemic to give them extra days off in exchange for accepting a salary cut.
Ryanair has previously urged the pilots to negotiate rather than strike and noted it had reached deals on working 
conditions with its Italian, French and Spanish staff.
Around half of the Ryanair flights out of Charleroi are piloted by non-Belgian crews, and the company said these 
went ahead as planned.

I
n the photograph I am sitting on a low wall wearing shorts and looking sunburned. On my knee is my daughter, who 
must have been about one, which means the year was 1992. We are somewhere in Tuscany and we are on 
holiday.
I'm not smiling - which isn't surprising, given everything. We had gone away with various couples with young 
children and had rented a villa where the rooms were dark and the walls thin.
All night the babies cried - as soon as one stopped another started up. Every morning frazzled adults dithered 
inconclusively over plans for that day, so by the time we arrived at Cortona or San Gimignano the heat was 
intolerable, as were the crowds of other foolish English people.
In the evening we did competitive cooking by rota and when it was my turn I laboured over a lasagne - my 
technique disparaged by the Italian villa owner, who had popped by to see if we were making a mess (we were). By 
Holidays from hell From challenging children and unhinged bus drivers to relationship meltdowns and kitchen 
catastrophes, Lucy Kellaway, Martin Wolf and other F....
the time our friends' children were finally in bed it was 10pm, the lasagne was desiccated and the adults not quite 
drunk enough not to notice.
Someone raised the subject of Maastricht and suddenly they were all shouting
at each other. I wanted to shout too: I don't give a crap about Maastricht! This isn't fun! I hate all of you! I want to go 
home!
It wasn't the worst holiday ever. But it was thoroughly unenjoyable in a way that should have been predictable. Why 
had I agreed to go away with other families for two whole weeks? Why did I think Tuscany would be nice in August 
when half the metropolitan elite from London would also be there?
Although I often dislike holidays when I'm on them, I love the idea of going away as much as the next person. 
According to a recent survey, half the
British adults questioned said they lived for their holidays. A third did jobs they hated in order to have money for a 
holiday that would give them a short break from the hatefulness. Most bizarre of all, a third said that of all the 
terrible things about Covid, not being able to fly off abroad was one of the worst.
What is this magic allure of a holiday that we can't do without? For me it's two things: rest and escape. Yet 60 
years' experience tell me how hard either is to achieve; my best chance of finding them is going somewhere familiar 
and quiet that I can reach by car. There is no rest queueing for Ryanair flights at Luton or fighting for the last hire 
car at midnight at some boiling European airport.
Being in a strange place also seems to invite mishaps and involve a disproportionate
number of brushes with the emergency services.
There was one holiday when our hire car skidded and flipped over and, although no one was hurt, there was 
endless argy bargy with the fire brigade. Twice we had all our luggage nicked, leading to waits in foreign police 
stations and at the embassy to get new passports.
There was a visit to a French hospital when I had been bitten by a dog and needed a rabies shot, and untold trips to 
strange doctors in search of antibiotics. Wherever there is a swimming pool Continued on page 2
Continued from page 1
there is a miserable child with an ear infection. Although tiresome, these things alone can't ruin a holiday. If it is 
otherwise enjoyable you can forgive unrestful interludes as being part of the adventure.
What is unforgivable is when a holiday fails to provide any escape. For me this is the central flaw in every planned 
getaway - there is no location far-flung enough to offer escape from yourself. Wherever I go my failings, moods and 
thoughts come along uninvited. Neither is there any escape from the family and friends you are travelling with as 
holiday
means 24-hour confinement in a way that real life never does.
This was the undoing of that Tuscan holiday. It was nothing to do with heat or sleep deprivation. It was the fact that 
otherwise serviceable friendships broke under the strain of enforced proximity.
By far the worst holiday of my life was on a Greek island with my husband and children. The Aegean Sea lapped 
the sand just below the veranda of the simple house we'd rented. We swam in the pale turquoise water and read 
books and ate in a pretty taverna where the retsina was cold and the feta salty. Yet the perfection of the 
surroundings provided no balm for a marriage that was in
Holidays from hell From challenging children and unhinged bus drivers to relationship meltdowns and kitchen 
catastrophes, Lucy Kellaway, Martin Wolf and other F....
trouble; instead it shone a spotlight on the extent of the dysfunction. Never have I longed so passionately for a 
holiday to be over so I could escape to the restful routine of everyday life.
Every morning this summer from 6am I can distantly hear the planes taking off at Newcastle airport. Every five 
minutes another couple of hundred people who have been living and saving for this break hurtle over my house 
towards their roasting hells in Corfu, Faro and Menorca.
From the cool peace of my own bed I hope they are not too disappointed, they don't fall out with family and friends 
and they return renewed. This year, at
least, I won't be going with them. Martin Wolf FT chief economics commentator In the summer of 1956, when I was 
just about to be 10, I went with my parents, my brother and a friend on what turned out to be my worst ever holiday. 
It was to Loch Lomond in Scotland.
The place was beautiful. But, alas, it rained incessantly. When the rain temporarily cleared, I, my mother, my 
younger brother (then nine years old) and my friend went on a walk into the hills. My father had returned to work in 
London.
We left the cottage in the late afternoon. After some time walking, we became separated somehow. I remained with 
my mother, while my brother and my friend went on ahead - and disappeared.
My mother, with me in tow, tried to find the two missing boys. But the area was far too large. Whether they heard 
our cries and ignored them or were too far away to hear, we did not know.
After some time, my increasingly worried mother decided to go back. She also must have hoped that the two boys 
had found their way home. We got back to the cottage at about 6pm. But there was still no sign of them.
By now, my poor mother was frantic and called the police. Then it got dark. Finally, at about 10pm, the two boys 
turned up.
My infuriated mother hit my brother, which she normally never did. Why, she demanded, had they separated? He 
explained that he had been trying to get to the top, but each ridge opened up a view to the next one.
After that frightening episode, my mother kept us close to her. Most of the time we were stuck in the cottage as the 
rain poured down. Finally, almost at the end of the holiday, we had a bright, sunny day and decided to swim. The 
water was cold, but refreshing. But I cut
my foot on a sharp stone. It bled freely.
My parents decided that the British Isles were not for summer holidays. Next summer, they found a flat in Bocca di 
Magra, a village on the coast of Liguria, in north-west Italy.
In the years that followed, my parents rented a flat there, and then, when I became a parent, I rented one with my 
brother and now we own one of our own in the same village.
Our worst holiday led to our best one, and many more after it.
Stephen Bush FT columnist and associate editor When I was 20, I had two plans for the money I had earned selling 
bad food at Legoland. The first was to visit my grandfather in Zambia, and the second was to go Interrailing in 
Europe. My cunning plan to do so involved taking a cut-price route to Kenneth Kaunda International, Lusaka's main 
airport. There are no direct flights from the UK to Zambia, but the usual route involves a journey to one of Africa's 
hub airports - usually in Nairobi or Johannesburg.
However, mystifyingly, it was cheaper - albeit more destructive to the planet - to fly from London to Amsterdam to 
Dubai before arriving in Nairobi.
Holidays from hell From challenging children and unhinged bus drivers to relationship meltdowns and kitchen 
catastrophes, Lucy Kellaway, Martin Wolf and other F....
The journey there, and the time with my grandfather, went off without a hitch. But my selfishness had clearly 
angered the planet, and my journey back was disrupted by the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull, 
which began to ground flights back to Europe as my return flight was halfway to Nairobi. I had a choice: stay in 
Nairobi for an indefinite period, head to Dubai for an indefinite period or try to make my way back to Europe by any 
available means.
I went for option C, which in the end meant a flight to Egypt, a flight from Cairo to Rome, and from Rome a series of 
trains and coaches to the ferry at Caen in France.
Travelling while mixed-race is, well, mixed. At best, everyone thinks you're local: I was greeted as café au lait in
France, caramello in Italy, and, to my surprise, as Egyptian in Cairo. But at worst, everyone thinks you're from 
whatever the local out-group is: I was abused as Algerian in Egypt and France, and curiously as Eritrean in Italy. I 
travelled in empty carriages through winding Italian countryside, in a sweltering
coach from Milan, and on a ferry that smelt overwhelmingly of stag do from Caen. By the end, I had used almost all 
of my nest egg. I suppose, in a sense, I did get to go Interrailing - but not quite in the way I wanted.
Bryce Elder FT City editor, Alphaville The low point was when I threw a paper plane at Pete Tong.
This was 2007. I'd been made redundant and was a few months away from becoming a father. My partner insisted I 
make the most of the freedom, since it would never happen again, but I was broke and lost. My last grasp at being 
carefree had a travel and accommodation budget of £250.
Several bad decisions later I checked into the cheapest room in the cheapest casino in downtown Las Vegas. The 
idea was to write something.
But two weeks alone in Vegas is too much. Everything about its immersive artificiality is designed to mainline vices 
and, not being much of a gambler, I
drank. Each day I'd walk to a different bar, write a sentence or two about the fraud at the heart of the American 
dream, and drink bourbon until being asked to leave.
The evening before my flight home, in a back room of the MGM Grand, the British DJ Pete Tong was playing. In my 
maudlin state I decided that he was a beacon of authenticity in this vacuous place and needed urgently to let him 
know, but casino goons blocked all routes to his booth. So I wrote a musical request in my notebook - the kind of 
obscure, serious tune that would signal he had an ally in the room - tore out the
page, folded it into a dart and threw it at his head.
The invitation to leave was unusually forceful. And now, whenever I catch myself reminiscing about life before 
responsibility, the memory of being ejected on to the Strip, having nearly taken out Pete Tong's eye, is a useful 
corrective.
Lilah Raptopoulos Host of FT Weekend podcast My family is not an adventure travel family, but one year, we 
convinced our-
selves to take the vacation of our lives: Guatemala. I was 18 and my sisters were 26 and 30, all of us single. It felt 
like maybe our last chance at a nuclearfamily holiday.
My mother planned the trip for months. There were volcanic hikes, scenic car rides, cooking classes, biking tours, 
maybe a zip line? We packed. We bought adaptors and new digital cameras. The night before our flight, around 
8pm, my sister called. In four small words, the dream slipped through our fingers. "Guys, my passport expired." It 
slipped through our fingers and straight down a well.

My mother spent that night on the phone, cancelling everything. She booked a last-minute trip to Florida to replace 
it, renting an old couple's timeshare in a retirement village. I remember us all meeting at the airport the next day. 
There was a long pause, and my sister looked at us and said, "Sorry, guys", and we laughed with rage.
I don't remember many details of the trip to Florida. I'm sure it was perfectly fine. The condo had decorative shells 
and pastel art. We probably ate at a few versions of the Joe's Crab Shack franchise. I also, strangely, hold a 
memory that my mind invented of the trip that never was: our family, joyfully zip-lining over a Guatemalan rainforest.
It's been 15 years. Guatemala has travel warnings, my sisters have kids, and we'll probably never go. But every
once in a while, my other sister still turns to me, and whispers, "We should have just gone. We should have sent 
her to the passport office and gone on that fucking trip."
Tim Hayward FT food critic and restaurateur I'm on holiday at the moment and, as Englishmen abroad must, 
reading Dante's The Divine Comedy. It's remark - able how current it remains.
I did not know that the eighth circle of Hell consisted of 10 concentric ditches or bolgias, each assigned to a subset 
of the fraudulent. Bolgias for panderers, corrupt politicians, counsellors of fraud and even one for simoniacs - those 
who sold favours and offices.
This prescient 14th-century genius had foreseen Boris Johnson, Andrew Tate and almost any other contemporary 
sinner. But even he would have had to dig down to extend. He'd have had to have built a whole 10th basement 
circle for the people who equip the kitchens in holiday rentals.
I am in the charming southern French town of UzÈs. Wine country. Honeyed stone baking in 30C heat. Food writer 
Elizabeth David came down here in her declining years, took a flat overlooking the twice-weekly market in the Place 
aux Herbes. Me? I get to stuff my bags with the finest produce and return to a kitchen where there are two blunt 
ceramic knives.
How, you scream, can ceramic knives be blunt? Simple stick a sharpening steel in the block next to them and watch 
a hundred frustrated holidaymakers send sparks showering into the night.
These look like they've been used to open bloody tins. Which is a distinct possibility, as there are relics of an 
electric can opener in the bottom drawer, keeping part of a wand blender and a wok lid company.
A few years ago I got caught trying to smuggle my own knives on to the "Boden Express" - the London to
Avignon train. Is it just, I ask you, that because I'm particular about julienning carrots, I should still be on a terrorist 
watchlist?
Airbnb has upped the game of shark rentiers. Everything looks great for the website. Stacks of fresh ecru towels on 
every beige surface. Fresh off-white paint. Also three incomplete coffeemakers, eight opened pots of paprika, three 
half-empty bottles of organic olive oil and a tub of Vegemite in a bedside drawer. There is one napkin/tea-towel 
curated to match the table linen rather than for absorbency. The crap oven has a pass-agg little note taped to it 
saying that if I sully its interior, I will incur a
(EURO)100 cleaning surcharge as "the cleaners are very busy". I want to heat up a tian, not puke in a cab.
Last night, in front of my own family, I did the trick of getting the cork out of a wine bottle with a wall and a deck 
shoe. I haven't done that since art college and hoped I'd never need to again. But then, I believed that when I was a 
grown-up, there would always be a corkscrew that worked.
Not four that didn't. Robert Armstrong FT US financial commentator Starting a family? Remember this phrase: "It's 
not a vacation; it's a family trip." I can't remember what hardened veteran of the parenting wars passed this mantra 
on to my wife and me, but it proved a crucial support as we raised our twins. It's not that small children make your

holidays hell. The hell comes as a result of believing, in the face of all experience and evidence, that you, parent of 
small children, get a holiday at all.
What you get, instead, is a family trip. One primary family trip activity, as all parents know, is touring the emergency 
rooms of sunny destinations. Do you know how ear infection treatment protocols vary, regionally and 
internationally?
I do, and you, parent-to-be, will soon
know it, too. And ear infections are low on the family trip illness difficulty scale. I will not soon forget the trip on 
which both of my children, aged two or three, got hand-foot-and-mouth disease, a nightmare of screaming, 
Popsicles and pink antibiotic liquid.
On family trips, as on vacation, you go and see the sights. But one does not do this because the sights are worth 
seeing. One does it because it tires out the children and fills the hours before it is appropriate for the adults to drink 
heavily. If you start to drink early in the day, who will drive to the ER?
My wife and I used to consolidate our family trips with those of her brother and sister-in-law and their three children. 
The idea, I think, was that there were economies of scale in child care. This may have been true. But, in retrospect, 
I suspect these benefits were outweighed by the fact that the ability of children to get into greater mischief as their 
numbers increase is not additive but multiplicative.
I remember a family trip to Wales when four of the children went running straight for a seaside cliff, the drop-off 
invisible until the last moment. Only last-second hysterical screaming by the fifth child stopped the worst from 
happening. All four parents - watching the whole thing, helpless, from several hundred yards away - suffered 
simultaneous nervous breakdowns.
Best of luck hiring local child care. I remember leaving the kids on the third floor of the Airbnb with two babysitters, 
almost ready to head out for dinner. Then our niece, 18 months old, came tumbling down the winding staircase 
towards the concrete floor of the front hallway. Her father just managed to stop
her on the last step. We decided to stay in and let the hire-a-nannies go.
Why, in those early years, did we attempt holidays at all? That's easy. Making a chaotic, filthy, deafening home life 
seem normal was worth the
price of the plane tickets. Jemima Kelly FT columnist Our five-and-a-half-hour bus ride from Kigali to Bujumbura 
had been going just fine until a man at the front, who was late for work, asked the driver to speed up. I had even 
begun to enjoy the journey, now that we had got over the Rwandan border into Burundi, had entered lush rainforest, 
and were making good progress towards our beach retreat.
We would be staying in a hut looking across to the Democratic Republic of Congo at the edge of Lake Tanganyika, 
which I had been excited to discover we would be sharing with the famous Gustave, a 20-foot, 2,000-pound 
crocodile rumoured to have killed as many as 300 people.
The problem was that the driver, who had seemed in good spirits until this point, did not appear to appreciate being 
asked to speed up - not one bit, in fact. He seemed somehow offended by the request. We watched in horror from 
the back of the bus as his demeanour turned to rage: gesticulations, shouting, and then foot flat on the gas.
"Buhoro, buhoro! [slow down, slow down!]" my sister shrieked in her best Kinyarwanda as we barrelled round a 
blind corner. But this, unfortunately, only served to wind the driver up further, and he seemed to want to show us: 
keeping his pedal to the metal he now lifted his hands off the steering wheel and threw them in the air. I gripped the 
back of the seat in front of me as we ploughed through a village, terrified mothers grabbing their children out of the 
way of the careering bus. We arrived at the Bujumbura bus station with legs

of jelly and dripping sweat, to be greeted by swarms of mosquitoes and ominous thunder clouds. I spent the next 
four days looking out for Gustave, reading about the horrors that King Leopold of Belgium brought to what is now 
the DRC, and thinking a lot about our journey back to Kigali.
Madison Darbyshire FT US investment correspondent I have one superstition, and it is that Rome is where 
relationships go to die.
My relationship perished there, on a romantic mini break. But it became a superstition when friends would tell me: I 
just had "your" trip to Rome. Meaning, they went to Rome and returned with a smouldering husk of a romance.
The trouble with Rome is that it is a city designed to be in love in. And when you're not in love, it feels obvious.
When all you have to do is wander through piazzas and gaze at cathedrals, eat four gelatos a day and languish 
over marathon meals, it is apparent when you've run out of things to talk about beyond what you can see. The 
sound of forks scraping spaghetti from plates felt desolate as we discussed the couples at other tables - a lifetime 
away from when he had kissed me outside a hectic train station at midnight, and we could have been the only two 
people in the world.
At dinner on our final evening, he took me to a restaurant where he had celebrated his birthday the year before. We 
had the same waitress, they exchanged witty repartee in Italian that I didn't need to understand to understand. They 
looked so cute together. He made her belly-laugh. I found myself wishing he would have the courage to ask for her 
number. It simultaneously occurred to me that this is not what you are supposed to want for the man you are dating.
Both of my children got hand-foot-and-mouth disease, a nightmare of screaming, Popsicles, and pink antibiotic

I
n the photograph I am sitting on a low wall wearing shorts and looking sunburned. On my knee is my daughter, who 
must have been about one, which means the year was 1992. We are somewhere in Tuscany and we are on 
holiday.
I'm not smiling - which isn't surprising, given everything. We had gone away with various couples with young 
children and had rented a villa where the rooms were dark and the walls thin.
All night the babies cried - as soon as one stopped another started up. Every morning frazzled adults dithered 
inconclusively over plans for that day, so by the time we arrived at Cortona or San Gimignano the heat was 
intolerable, as were the crowds of other foolish English people.
In the evening we did competitive cooking by rota and when it was my turn I laboured over a lasagne - my 
technique disparaged by the Italian villa owner, who had popped by to see if we were making a mess (we were). By 
Holidays from hell From challenging children and unhinged bus drivers to relationship meltdowns and kitchen 
catastrophes, Lucy Kellaway, Martin Wolf and other F....
the time our friends' children were finally in bed it was 10pm, the lasagne was desiccated and the adults not quite 
drunk enough not to notice.
Someone raised the subject of Maastricht and suddenly they were all shouting
at each other. I wanted to shout too: I don't give a crap about Maastricht! This isn't fun! I hate all of you! I want to go 
home!
It wasn't the worst holiday ever. But it was thoroughly unenjoyable in a way that should have been predictable. Why 
had I agreed to go away with other families for two whole weeks? Why did I think Tuscany would be nice in August 
when half the metropolitan elite from London would also be there?
Although I often dislike holidays when I'm on them, I love the idea of going away as much as the next person. 
According to a recent survey, half the
British adults questioned said they lived for their holidays. A third did jobs they hated in order to have money for a 
holiday that would give them a short break from the hatefulness. Most bizarre of all, a third said that of all the 
terrible things about Covid, not being able to fly off abroad was one of the worst.
What is this magic allure of a holiday that we can't do without? For me it's two things: rest and escape. Yet 60 
years' experience tell me how hard either is to achieve; my best chance of finding them is going somewhere familiar 
and quiet that I can reach by car. There is no rest queueing for Ryanair flights at Luton or fighting for the last hire 
car at midnight at some boiling European airport.
Being in a strange place also seems to invite mishaps and involve a disproportionate
number of brushes with the emergency services.
There was one holiday when our hire car skidded and flipped over and, although no one was hurt, there was 
endless argy bargy with the fire brigade. Twice we had all our luggage nicked, leading to waits in foreign police 
stations and at the embassy to get new passports.
There was a visit to a French hospital when I had been bitten by a dog and needed a rabies shot, and untold trips to 
strange doctors in search of antibiotics. Wherever there is a swimming pool Continued on page 2
Continued from page 1
there is a miserable child with an ear infection. Although tiresome, these things alone can't ruin a holiday. If it is 
otherwise enjoyable you can forgive unrestful interludes as being part of the adventure.
What is unforgivable is when a holiday fails to provide any escape. For me this is the central flaw in every planned 
getaway - there is no location far-flung enough to offer escape from yourself. Wherever I go my failings, moods and 
thoughts come along uninvited. Neither is there any escape from the family and friends you are travelling with as 
holiday
means 24-hour confinement in a way that real life never does.
This was the undoing of that Tuscan holiday. It was nothing to do with heat or sleep deprivation. It was the fact that 
otherwise serviceable friendships broke under the strain of enforced proximity.
By far the worst holiday of my life was on a Greek island with my husband and children. The Aegean Sea lapped 
the sand just below the veranda of the simple house we'd rented. We swam in the pale turquoise water and read 
books and ate in a pretty taverna where the retsina was cold and the feta salty. Yet the perfection of the 
surroundings provided no balm for a marriage that was in
Holidays from hell From challenging children and unhinged bus drivers to relationship meltdowns and kitchen

trouble; instead it shone a spotlight on the extent of the dysfunction. Never have I longed so passionately for a 
holiday to be over so I could escape to the restful routine of everyday life.
Every morning this summer from 6am I can distantly hear the planes taking off at Newcastle airport. Every five 
minutes another couple of hundred people who have been living and saving for this break hurtle over my house 
towards their roasting hells in Corfu, Faro and Menorca.
From the cool peace of my own bed I hope they are not too disappointed, they don't fall out with family and friends 
and they return renewed. This year, at
least, I won't be going with them. Martin Wolf FT chief economics commentator In the summer of 1956, when I was 
just about to be 10, I went with my parents, my brother and a friend on what turned out to be my worst ever holiday. 
It was to Loch Lomond in Scotland.
The place was beautiful. But, alas, it rained incessantly. When the rain temporarily cleared, I, my mother, my 
younger brother (then nine years old) and my friend went on a walk into the hills. My father had returned to work in 
London.
We left the cottage in the late afternoon. After some time walking, we became separated somehow. I remained with 
my mother, while my brother and my friend went on ahead - and disappeared.
My mother, with me in tow, tried to find the two missing boys. But the area was far too large. Whether they heard 
our cries and ignored them or were too far away to hear, we did not know.
After some time, my increasingly worried mother decided to go back. She also must have hoped that the two boys 
had found their way home. We got back to the cottage at about 6pm. But there was still no sign of them.
By now, my poor mother was frantic and called the police. Then it got dark. Finally, at about 10pm, the two boys 
turned up.
My infuriated mother hit my brother, which she normally never did. Why, she demanded, had they separated? He 
explained that he had been trying to get to the top, but each ridge opened up a view to the next one.
After that frightening episode, my mother kept us close to her. Most of the time we were stuck in the cottage as the 
rain poured down. Finally, almost at the end of the holiday, we had a bright, sunny day and decided to swim. The 
water was cold, but refreshing. But I cut
my foot on a sharp stone. It bled freely.
My parents decided that the British Isles were not for summer holidays. Next summer, they found a flat in Bocca di 
Magra, a village on the coast of Liguria, in north-west Italy.
In the years that followed, my parents rented a flat there, and then, when I became a parent, I rented one with my 
brother and now we own one of our own in the same village.
Our worst holiday led to our best one, and many more after it.
Stephen Bush FT columnist and associate editor When I was 20, I had two plans for the money I had earned selling 
bad food at Legoland. The first was to visit my grandfather in Zambia, and the second was to go Interrailing in 
Europe. My cunning plan to do so involved taking a cut-price route to Kenneth Kaunda International, Lusaka's main 
airport. There are no direct flights from the UK to Zambia, but the usual route involves a journey to one of Africa's 
hub airports - usually in Nairobi or Johannesburg.
However, mystifyingly, it was cheaper - albeit more destructive to the planet - to fly from London to Amsterdam to 
Dubai before arriving in Nairobi.
Holidays from hell From challenging children and unhinged bus drivers to relationship meltdowns and kitchen 
catastrophes, Lucy Kellaway, Martin Wolf and other F....
The journey there, and the time with my grandfather, went off without a hitch. But my selfishness had clearly 
angered the planet, and my journey back was disrupted by the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull, 
which began to ground flights back to Europe as my return flight was halfway to Nairobi. I had a choice: stay in 
Nairobi for an indefinite period, head to Dubai for an indefinite period or try to make my way back to Europe by any 
available means.
I went for option C, which in the end meant a flight to Egypt, a flight from Cairo to Rome, and from Rome a series of 
trains and coaches to the ferry at Caen in France.
Travelling while mixed-race is, well, mixed. At best, everyone thinks you're local: I was greeted as café au lait in
France, caramello in Italy, and, to my surprise, as Egyptian in Cairo. But at worst, everyone thinks you're from 
whatever the local out-group is: I was abused as Algerian in Egypt and France, and curiously as Eritrean in Italy. I 
travelled in empty carriages through winding Italian countryside, in a sweltering
coach from Milan, and on a ferry that smelt overwhelmingly of stag do from Caen. By the end, I had used almost all 
of my nest egg. I suppose, in a sense, I did get to go Interrailing - but not quite in the way I wanted.
Bryce Elder FT City editor, Alphaville The low point was when I threw a paper plane at Pete Tong.
This was 2007. I'd been made redundant and was a few months away from becoming a father. My partner insisted I 
make the most of the freedom, since it would never happen again, but I was broke and lost. My last grasp at being 
carefree had a travel and accommodation budget of £250.
Several bad decisions later I checked into the cheapest room in the cheapest casino in downtown Las Vegas. The 
idea was to write something.
But two weeks alone in Vegas is too much. Everything about its immersive artificiality is designed to mainline vices 
and, not being much of a gambler, I
drank. Each day I'd walk to a different bar, write a sentence or two about the fraud at the heart of the American 
dream, and drink bourbon until being asked to leave.
The evening before my flight home, in a back room of the MGM Grand, the British DJ Pete Tong was playing. In my 
maudlin state I decided that he was a beacon of authenticity in this vacuous place and needed urgently to let him 
know, but casino goons blocked all routes to his booth. So I wrote a musical request in my notebook - the kind of 
obscure, serious tune that would signal he had an ally in the room - tore out the
page, folded it into a dart and threw it at his head.
The invitation to leave was unusually forceful. And now, whenever I catch myself reminiscing about life before 
responsibility, the memory of being ejected on to the Strip, having nearly taken out Pete Tong's eye, is a useful 
corrective.
Lilah Raptopoulos Host of FT Weekend podcast My family is not an adventure travel family, but one year, we 
convinced our-
selves to take the vacation of our lives: Guatemala. I was 18 and my sisters were 26 and 30, all of us single. It felt 
like maybe our last chance at a nuclearfamily holiday.

it, renting an old couple's timeshare in a retirement village. I remember us all meeting at the airport the next day.

n the photograph I am sitting on a low wall wearing shorts and looking sunburned. On my knee is my daughter, who 
must have been about one, which means the year was 1992. We are somewhere in Tuscany and we are on 
holiday.
I'm not smiling - which isn't surprising, given everything. We had gone away with various couples with young 
children and had rented a villa where the rooms were dark and the walls thin.
All night the babies cried - as soon as one stopped another started up. Every morning frazzled adults dithered 
inconclusively over plans for that day, so by the time we arrived at Cortona or San Gimignano the heat was 
intolerable, as were the crowds of other foolish English people.
In the evening we did competitive cooking by rota and when it was my turn I laboured over a lasagne - my 
technique disparaged by the Italian villa owner, who had popped by to see if we were making a mess (we were). By

the time our friends' children were finally in bed it was 10pm, the lasagne was desiccated and the adults not quite 
drunk enough not to notice.
Someone raised the subject of Maastricht and suddenly they were all shouting
at each other. I wanted to shout too: I don't give a crap about Maastricht! This isn't fun! I hate all of you! I want to go 
home!
It wasn't the worst holiday ever. But it was thoroughly unenjoyable in a way that should have been predictable. Why 
had I agreed to go away with other families for two whole weeks? Why did I think Tuscany would be nice in August 
when half the metropolitan elite from London would also be there?
Although I often dislike holidays when I'm on them, I love the idea of going away as much as the next person. 
According to a recent survey, half the
British adults questioned said they lived for their holidays. A third did jobs they hated in order to have money for a 
holiday that would give them a short break from the hatefulness. Most bizarre of all, a third said that of all the 
terrible things about Covid, not being able to fly off abroad was one of the worst.
What is this magic allure of a holiday that we can't do without? For me it's two things: rest and escape. Yet 60 
years' experience tell me how hard either is to achieve; my best chance of finding them is going somewhere familiar 
and quiet that I can reach by car. There is no rest queueing for Ryanair flights at Luton or fighting for the last hire 
car at midnight at some boiling European airport.
Being in a strange place also seems to invite mishaps and involve a disproportionate
number of brushes with the emergency services.
There was one holiday when our hire car skidded and flipped over and, although no one was hurt, there was 
endless argy bargy with the fire brigade. Twice we had all our luggage nicked, leading to waits in foreign police 
stations and at the embassy to get new passports.
There was a visit to a French hospital when I had been bitten by a dog and needed a rabies shot, and untold trips to 
strange doctors in search of antibiotics. Wherever there is a swimming pool Continued on page 2

there is a miserable child with an ear infection. Although tiresome, these things alone can't ruin a holiday. If it is 
otherwise enjoyable you can forgive unrestful interludes as being part of the adventure.
What is unforgivable is when a holiday fails to provide any escape. For me this is the central flaw in every planned 
getaway - there is no location far-flung enough to offer escape from yourself. Wherever I go my failings, moods and 
thoughts come along uninvited. Neither is there any escape from the family and friends you are travelling with as 
holiday
means 24-hour confinement in a way that real life never does.
This was the undoing of that Tuscan holiday. It was nothing to do with heat or sleep deprivation. It was the fact that 
otherwise serviceable friendships broke under the strain of enforced proximity.
By far the worst holiday of my life was on a Greek island with my husband and children. The Aegean Sea lapped 
the sand just below the veranda of the simple house we'd rented. We swam in the pale turquoise water and read 
books and ate in a pretty taverna where the retsina was cold and the feta salty. Yet the perfection of the 
surroundings provided no balm for a marriage that was in

trouble; instead it shone a spotlight on the extent of the dysfunction. Never have I longed so passionately for a 
holiday to be over so I could escape to the restful routine of everyday life.
Every morning this summer from 6am I can distantly hear the planes taking off at Newcastle airport. Every five 
minutes another couple of hundred people who have been living and saving for this break hurtle over my house 
towards their roasting hells in Corfu, Faro and Menorca.
From the cool peace of my own bed I hope they are not too disappointed, they don't fall out with family and friends 
and they return renewed. This year, at
least, I won't be going with them. Martin Wolf FT chief economics commentator In the summer of 1956, when I was 
just about to be 10, I went with my parents, my brother and a friend on what turned out to be my worst ever holiday. 
It was to Loch Lomond in Scotland.
The place was beautiful. But, alas, it rained incessantly. When the rain temporarily cleared, I, my mother, my 
younger brother (then nine years old) and my friend went on a walk into the hills. My father had returned to work in 
London.
We left the cottage in the late afternoon. After some time walking, we became separated somehow. I remained with 
my mother, while my brother and my friend went on ahead - and disappeared.
My mother, with me in tow, tried to find the two missing boys. But the area was far too large. Whether they heard 
our cries and ignored them or were too far away to hear, we did not know.
After some time, my increasingly worried mother decided to go back. She also must have hoped that the two boys 
had found their way home. We got back to the cottage at about 6pm. But there was still no sign of them.
By now, my poor mother was frantic and called the police. Then it got dark. Finally, at about 10pm, the two boys 
turned up.
My infuriated mother hit my brother, which she normally never did. Why, she demanded, had they separated? He 
explained that he had been trying to get to the top, but each ridge opened up a view to the next one.
After that frightening episode, my mother kept us close to her. Most of the time we were stuck in the cottage as the 
rain poured down. Finally, almost at the end of the holiday, we had a bright, sunny day and decided to swim. The 
water was cold, but refreshing. But I cut
my foot on a sharp stone. It bled freely.
My parents decided that the British Isles were not for summer holidays. Next summer, they found a flat in Bocca di 
Magra, a village on the coast of Liguria, in north-west Italy.
In the years that followed, my parents rented a flat there, and then, when I became a parent, I rented one with my 
brother and now we own one of our own in the same village.
Our worst holiday led to our best one, and many more after it.
Stephen Bush FT columnist and associate editor When I was 20, I had two plans for the money I had earned selling 
bad food at Legoland. The first was to visit my grandfather in Zambia, and the second was to go Interrailing in 
Europe. My cunning plan to do so involved taking a cut-price route to Kenneth Kaunda International, Lusaka's main 
airport. There are no direct flights from the UK to Zambia, but the usual route involves a journey to one of Africa's 
hub airports - usually in Nairobi or Johannesburg.
However, mystifyingly, it was cheaper - albeit more destructive to the planet - to fly from London to Amsterdam to 
Dubai before arriving in Nairobi.
Holidays from hell From challenging children and unhinged bus drivers to relationship meltdowns and kitchen 
catastrophes, Lucy Kellaway, Martin Wolf and other F....
The journey there, and the time with my grandfather, went off without a hitch. But my selfishness had clearly 
angered the planet, and my journey back was disrupted by the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull, 
which began to ground flights back to Europe as my return flight was halfway to Nairobi. I had a choice: stay in 
Nairobi for an indefinite period, head to Dubai for an indefinite period or try to make my way back to Europe by any 
available means.
I went for option C, which in the end meant a flight to Egypt, a flight from Cairo to Rome, and from Rome a series of 
trains and coaches to the ferry at Caen in France.
Travelling while mixed-race is, well, mixed. At best, everyone thinks you're local: I was greeted as café au lait in
France, caramello in Italy, and, to my surprise, as Egyptian in Cairo. But at worst, everyone thinks you're from 
whatever the local out-group is: I was abused as Algerian in Egypt and France, and curiously as Eritrean in Italy. I 
travelled in empty carriages through winding Italian countryside, in a sweltering
coach from Milan, and on a ferry that smelt overwhelmingly of stag do from Caen. By the end, I had used almost all 
of my nest egg. I suppose, in a sense, I did get to go Interrailing - but not quite in the way I wanted.
Bryce Elder FT City editor, Alphaville The low point was when I threw a paper plane at Pete Tong.
This was 2007. I'd been made redundant and was a few months away from becoming a father. My partner insisted I 
make the most of the freedom, since it would never happen again, but I was broke and lost. My last grasp at being 
carefree had a travel and accommodation budget of £250.
Several bad decisions later I checked into the cheapest room in the cheapest casino in downtown Las Vegas. The 
idea was to write something.
But two weeks alone in Vegas is too much. Everything about its immersive artificiality is designed to mainline vices 
and, not being much of a gambler, I
drank. Each day I'd walk to a different bar, write a sentence or two about the fraud at the heart of the American 
dream, and drink bourbon until being asked to leave.
The evening before my flight home, in a back room of the MGM Grand, the British DJ Pete Tong was playing. In my 
maudlin state I decided that he was a beacon of authenticity in this vacuous place and needed urgently to let him 
know, but casino goons blocked all routes to his booth. So I wrote a musical request in my notebook - the kind of 
obscure, serious tune that would signal he had an ally in the room - tore out the
page, folded it into a dart and threw it at his head.
The invitation to leave was unusually forceful. And now, whenever I catch myself reminiscing about life before 
responsibility, the memory of being ejected on to the Strip, having nearly taken out Pete Tong's eye, is a useful 
corrective.
Lilah Raptopoulos Host of FT Weekend podcast My family is not an adventure travel family, but one year, we 
convinced our-
selves to take the vacation of our lives: Guatemala. I was 18 and my sisters were 26 and 30, all of us single. It felt 
like maybe our last chance at a nuclearfamily holiday.
My mother planned the trip for months. There were volcanic hikes, scenic car rides, cooking classes, biking tours, 
maybe a zip line? We packed. We bought adaptors and new digital cameras. The night before our flight, around 
8pm, my sister called. In four small words, the dream slipped through our fingers. "Guys, my passport expired." It 
slipped through our fingers and straight down a well.

catastrophes, Lucy Kellaway, Martin Wolf and other F....
My mother spent that night on the phone, cancelling everything. She booked a last-minute trip to Florida to replace 
it, renting an old couple's timeshare in a retirement village. I remember us all meeting at the airport the next day. 
There was a long pause, and my sister looked at us and said, "Sorry, guys", and we laughed with rage.
I don't remember many details of the trip to Florida. I'm sure it was perfectly fine. The condo had decorative shells 
and pastel art. We probably ate at a few versions of the Joe's Crab Shack franchise. I also, strangely, hold a 
memory that my mind invented of the trip that never was: our family, joyfully zip-lining over a Guatemalan rainforest.
It's been 15 years. Guatemala has travel warnings, my sisters have kids, and we'll probably never go. But every
once in a while, my other sister still turns to me, and whispers, "We should have just gone. We should have sent 
her to the passport office and gone on that fucking trip."
Tim Hayward FT food critic and restaurateur I'm on holiday at the moment and, as Englishmen abroad must, 
reading Dante's The Divine Comedy. It's remark - able how current it remains.
I did not know that the eighth circle of Hell consisted of 10 concentric ditches or bolgias, each assigned to a subset 
of the fraudulent. Bolgias for panderers, corrupt politicians, counsellors of fraud and even one for simoniacs - those 
who sold favours and offices.
This prescient 14th-century genius had foreseen Boris Johnson, Andrew Tate and almost any other contemporary 
sinner. But even he would have had to dig down to extend. He'd have had to have built a whole 10th basement 
circle for the people who equip the kitchens in holiday rentals.
I am in the charming southern French town of UzÈs. Wine country. Honeyed stone baking in 30C heat. Food writer 
Elizabeth David came down here in her declining years, took a flat overlooking the twice-weekly market in the Place 
aux Herbes. Me? I get to stuff my bags with the finest produce and return to a kitchen where there are two blunt 
ceramic knives.
How, you scream, can ceramic knives be blunt? Simple stick a sharpening steel in the block next to them and watch 
a hundred frustrated holidaymakers send sparks showering into the night.
These look like they've been used to open bloody tins. Which is a distinct possibility, as there are relics of an 
electric can opener in the bottom drawer, keeping part of a wand blender and a wok lid company.
A few years ago I got caught trying to smuggle my own knives on to the "Boden Express" - the London to
Avignon train. Is it just, I ask you, that because I'm particular about julienning carrots, I should still be on a terrorist 
watchlist?
Airbnb has upped the game of shark rentiers. Everything looks great for the website. Stacks of fresh ecru towels on 
every beige surface. Fresh off-white paint. Also three incomplete coffeemakers, eight opened pots of paprika, three 
half-empty bottles of organic olive oil and a tub of Vegemite in a bedside drawer. There is one napkin/tea-towel 
curated to match the table linen rather than for absorbency. The crap oven has a pass-agg little note taped to it 
saying that if I sully its interior, I will incur a
(EURO)100 cleaning surcharge as "the cleaners are very busy". I want to heat up a tian, not puke in a cab.
Last night, in front of my own family, I did the trick of getting the cork out of a wine bottle with a wall and a deck 
shoe. I haven't done that since art college and hoped I'd never need to again. But then, I believed that when I was a 
grown-up, there would always be a corkscrew that worked.
Not four that didn't. Robert Armstrong FT US financial commentator Starting a family? Remember this phrase: "It's 
not a vacation; it's a family trip." I can't remember what hardened veteran of the parenting wars passed this mantra 
on to my wife and me, but it proved a crucial support as we raised our twins. It's not that small children make your

holidays hell. The hell comes as a result of believing, in the face of all experience and evidence, that you, parent of 
small children, get a holiday at all.
What you get, instead, is a family trip. One primary family trip activity, as all parents know, is touring the emergency 
rooms of sunny destinations. Do you know how ear infection treatment protocols vary, regionally and 
internationally?
I do, and you, parent-to-be, will soon
know it, too. And ear infections are low on the family trip illness difficulty scale. I will not soon forget the trip on 
which both of my children, aged two or three, got hand-foot-and-mouth disease, a nightmare of screaming, 
Popsicles and pink antibiotic liquid.
On family trips, as on vacation, you go and see the sights. But one does not do this because the sights are worth 
seeing. One does it because it tires out the children and fills the hours before it is appropriate for the adults to drink 
heavily. If you start to drink early in the day, who will drive to the ER?
My wife and I used to consolidate our family trips with those of her brother and sister-in-law and their three children. 
The idea, I think, was that there were economies of scale in child care. This may have been true. But, in retrospect, 
I suspect these benefits were outweighed by the fact that the ability of children to get into greater mischief as their 
numbers increase is not additive but multiplicative.
I remember a family trip to Wales when four of the children went running straight for a seaside cliff, the drop-off 
invisible until the last moment. Only last-second hysterical screaming by the fifth child stopped the worst from 
happening. All four parents - watching the whole thing, helpless, from several hundred yards away - suffered 
simultaneous nervous breakdowns.
Best of luck hiring local child care. I remember leaving the kids on the third floor of the Airbnb with two babysitters, 
almost ready to head out for dinner. Then our niece, 18 months old, came tumbling down the winding staircase 
towards the concrete floor of the front hallway. Her father just managed to stop
her on the last step. We decided to stay in and let the hire-a-nannies go.
Why, in those early years, did we attempt holidays at all? That's easy. Making a chaotic, filthy, deafening home life 
seem normal was worth the
price of the plane tickets. Jemima Kelly FT columnist Our five-and-a-half-hour bus ride from Kigali to Bujumbura 
had been going just fine until a man at the front, who was late for work, asked the driver to speed up. I had even 
begun to enjoy the journey, now that we had got over the Rwandan border into Burundi, had entered lush rainforest, 
and were making good progress towards our beach retreat.
We would be staying in a hut looking across to the Democratic Republic of Congo at the edge of Lake Tanganyika, 
which I had been excited to discover we would be sharing with the famous Gustave, a 20-foot, 2,000-pound 
crocodile rumoured to have killed as many as 300 people.
The problem was that the driver, who had seemed in good spirits until this point, did not appear to appreciate being 
asked to speed up - not one bit, in fact. He seemed somehow offended by the request. We watched in horror from 
the back of the bus as his demeanour turned to rage: gesticulations, shouting, and then foot flat on the gas.
"Buhoro, buhoro! [slow down, slow down!]" my sister shrieked in her best Kinyarwanda as we barrelled round a 
blind corner. But this, unfortunately, only served to wind the driver up further, and he seemed to want to show us: 
keeping his pedal to the metal he now lifted his hands off the steering wheel and threw them in the air. I gripped the 
back of the seat in front of me as we ploughed through a village, terrified mothers grabbing their children out of the 
way of the careering bus. We arrived at the Bujumbura bus station with legs
Holidays from hell From challenging children and unhinged bus drivers to relationship meltdowns and kitchen 
catastrophes, Lucy Kellaway, Martin Wolf and other F....
of jelly and dripping sweat, to be greeted by swarms of mosquitoes and ominous thunder clouds. I spent the next 
four days looking out for Gustave, reading about the horrors that King Leopold of Belgium brought to what is now 
the DRC, and thinking a lot about our journey back to Kigali.
Madison Darbyshire FT US investment correspondent I have one superstition, and it is that Rome is where 
relationships go to die.
My relationship perished there, on a romantic mini break. But it became a superstition when friends would tell me: I 
just had "your" trip to Rome. Meaning, they went to Rome and returned with a smouldering husk of a romance.
The trouble with Rome is that it is a city designed to be in love in. And when you're not in love, it feels obvious.
When all you have to do is wander through piazzas and gaze at cathedrals, eat four gelatos a day and languish 
over marathon meals, it is apparent when you've run out of things to talk about beyond what you can see. The 
sound of forks scraping spaghetti from plates felt desolate as we discussed the couples at other tables - a lifetime 
away from when he had kissed me outside a hectic train station at midnight, and we could have been the only two 
people in the world.
At dinner on our final evening, he took me to a restaurant where he had celebrated his birthday the year before. We 
had the same waitress, they exchanged witty repartee in Italian that I didn't need to understand to understand. They 
looked so cute together. He made her belly-laugh. I found myself wishing he would have the courage to ask for her 
number. It simultaneously occurred to me that this is not what you are supposed to want for the man you are dating.

Nairobi for an indefinite period, head to Dubai for an indefinite period or try to make my way back to Europe by any 
available means.
I went for option C, which in the end meant a flight to Egypt, a flight from Cairo to Rome, and from Rome a series of 
trains and coaches to the ferry at Caen in France.
Travelling while mixed-race is, well, mixed. At best, everyone thinks you're local: I was greeted as café au lait in
France, caramello in Italy, and, to my surprise, as Egyptian in Cairo. But at worst, everyone thinks you're from 
whatever the local out-group is: I was abused as Algerian in Egypt and France, and curiously as Eritrean in Italy. I 
travelled in empty carriages through winding Italian countryside, in a sweltering
coach from Milan, and on a ferry that smelt overwhelmingly of stag do from Caen. By the end, I had used almost all 
of my nest egg. I suppose, in a sense, I did get to go Interrailing - but not quite in the way I wanted.
Bryce Elder FT City editor, Alphaville The low point was when I threw a paper plane at Pete Tong.
This was 2007. I'd been made redundant and was a few months away from becoming a father. My partner insisted I 
make the most of the freedom, since it would never happen again, but I was broke and lost. My last grasp at being 
carefree had a travel and accommodation budget of £250.
Several bad decisions later I checked into the cheapest room in the cheapest casino in downtown Las Vegas. The 
idea was to write something.
But two weeks alone in Vegas is too much. Everything about its immersive artificiality is designed to mainline vices 
and, not being much of a gambler, I
drank. Each day I'd walk to a different bar, write a sentence or two about the fraud at the heart of the American 
dream, and drink bourbon until being asked to leave.
The evening before my flight home, in a back room of the MGM Grand, the British DJ Pete Tong was playing. In my 
maudlin state I decided that he was a beacon of authenticity in this vacuous place and needed urgently to let him 
know, but casino goons blocked all routes to his booth. So I wrote a musical request in my notebook - the kind of 
obscure, serious tune that would signal he had an ally in the room - tore out the
page, folded it into a dart and threw it at his head.
The invitation to leave was unusually forceful. And now, whenever I catch myself reminiscing about life before 
responsibility, the memory of being ejected on to the Strip, having nearly taken out Pete Tong's eye, is a useful 
corrective.
Lilah Raptopoulos Host of FT Weekend podcast My family is not an adventure travel family, but one year, we 
convinced our-
selves to take the vacation of our lives: Guatemala. I was 18 and my sisters were 26 and 30, all of us single. It felt 
like maybe our last chance at a nuclearfamily holiday.
My mother planned the trip for months. There were volcanic hikes, scenic car rides, cooking classes, biking tours, 
maybe a zip line? We packed. We bought adaptors and new digital cameras. The night before our flight, around 
8pm, my sister called. In four small words, the dream slipped through our fingers. "Guys, my passport expired." It 
slipped through our fingers and straight down a well.

catastrophes, Lucy Kellaway, Martin Wolf and other F....
My mother spent that night on the phone, cancelling everything. She booked a last-minute trip to Florida to replace 
it, renting an old couple's timeshare in a retirement village. I remember us all meeting at the airport the next day. 
There was a long pause, and my sister looked at us and said, "Sorry, guys", and we laughed with rage.
I don't remember many details of the trip to Florida. I'm sure it was perfectly fine. The condo had decorative shells 
and pastel art. We probably ate at a few versions of the Joe's Crab Shack franchise. I also, strangely, hold a 
memory that my mind invented of the trip that never was: our family, joyfully zip-lining over a Guatemalan rainforest.
It's been 15 years. Guatemala has travel warnings, my sisters have kids, and we'll probably never go. But every
once in a while, my other sister still turns to me, and whispers, "We should have just gone. We should have sent 
her to the passport office and gone on that fucking trip."
Tim Hayward FT food critic and restaurateur I'm on holiday at the moment and, as Englishmen abroad must, 
reading Dante's The Divine Comedy. It's remark - able how current it remains.
I did not know that the eighth circle of Hell consisted of 10 concentric ditches or bolgias, each assigned to a subset 
of the fraudulent. Bolgias for panderers, corrupt politicians, counsellors of fraud and even one for simoniacs - those 
who sold favours and offices.
This prescient 14th-century genius had foreseen Boris Johnson, Andrew Tate and almost any other contemporary 
sinner. But even he would have had to dig down to extend. He'd have had to have built a whole 10th basement 
circle for the people who equip the kitchens in holiday rentals.
I am in the charming southern French town of UzÈs. Wine country. Honeyed stone baking in 30C heat. Food writer 
Elizabeth David came down here in her declining years, took a flat overlooking the twice-weekly market in the Place 
aux Herbes. Me? I get to stuff my bags with the finest produce and return to a kitchen where there are two blunt 
ceramic knives.
How, you scream, can ceramic knives be blunt? Simple stick a sharpening steel in the block next to them and watch 
a hundred frustrated holidaymakers send sparks showering into the night.
These look like they've been used to open bloody tins. Which is a distinct possibility, as there are relics of an 
electric can opener in the bottom drawer, keeping part of a wand blender and a wok lid company.
A few years ago I got caught trying to smuggle my own knives on to the "Boden Express" - the London to
Avignon train. Is it just, I ask you, that because I'm particular about julienning carrots, I should still be on a terrorist 
watchlist?
Airbnb has upped the game of shark rentiers. Everything looks great for the website. Stacks of fresh ecru towels on 
every beige surface. Fresh off-white paint. Also three incomplete coffeemakers, eight opened pots of paprika, three 
half-empty bottles of organic olive oil and a tub of Vegemite in a bedside drawer. There is one napkin/tea-towel 
curated to match the table linen rather than for absorbency. The crap oven has a pass-agg little note taped to it 
saying that if I sully its interior, I will incur a
(EURO)100 cleaning surcharge as "the cleaners are very busy". I want to heat up a tian, not puke in a cab.
Last night, in front of my own family, I did the trick of getting the cork out of a wine bottle with a wall and a deck 
shoe. I haven't done that since art college and hoped I'd never need to again. But then, I believed that when I was a 
grown-up, there would always be a corkscrew that worked.
Not four that didn't. Robert Armstrong FT US financial commentator Starting a family? Remember this phrase: "It's 
not a vacation; it's a family trip." I can't remember what hardened veteran of the parenting wars passed this mantra 
on to my wife and me, but it proved a crucial support as we raised our twins. It's not that small children make your 
Holidays from hell From challenging children and unhinged bus drivers to relationship meltdowns and kitchen

holidays hell. The hell comes as a result of believing, in the face of all experience and evidence, that you, parent of 
small children, get a holiday at all.
What you get, instead, is a family trip. One primary family trip activity, as all parents know, is touring the emergency 
rooms of sunny destinations. Do you know how ear infection treatment protocols vary, regionally and 
internationally?
I do, and you, parent-to-be, will soon
know it, too. And ear infections are low on the family trip illness difficulty scale. I will not soon forget the trip on 
which both of my children, aged two or three, got hand-foot-and-mouth disease, a nightmare of screaming, 
Popsicles and pink antibiotic liquid.
On family trips, as on vacation, you go and see the sights. But one does not do this because the sights are worth 
seeing. One does it because it tires out the children and fills the hours before it is appropriate for the adults to drink 
heavily. If you start to drink early in the day, who will drive to the ER?
My wife and I used to consolidate our family trips with those of her brother and sister-in-law and their three children. 
The idea, I think, was that there were economies of scale in child care. This may have been true. But, in retrospect, 
I suspect these benefits were outweighed by the fact that the ability of children to get into greater mischief as their 
numbers increase is not additive but multiplicative.
I remember a family trip to Wales when four of the children went running straight for a seaside cliff, the drop-off 
invisible until the last moment. Only last-second hysterical screaming by the fifth child stopped the worst from 
happening. All four parents - watching the whole thing, helpless, from several hundred yards away - suffered 
simultaneous nervous breakdowns.
Best of luck hiring local child care. I remember leaving the kids on the third floor of the Airbnb with two babysitters, 
almost ready to head out for dinner. Then our niece, 18 months old, came tumbling down the winding staircase 
towards the concrete floor of the front hallway. Her father just managed to stop
her on the last step. We decided to stay in and let the hire-a-nannies go.
Why, in those early years, did we attempt holidays at all? That's easy. Making a chaotic, filthy, deafening home life 
seem normal was worth the
price of the plane tickets. Jemima Kelly FT columnist Our five-and-a-half-hour bus ride from Kigali to Bujumbura 
had been going just fine until a man at the front, who was late for work, asked the driver to speed up. I had even 
begun to enjoy the journey, now that we had got over the Rwandan border into Burundi, had entered lush rainforest, 
and were making good progress towards our beach retreat.
We would be staying in a hut looking across to the Democratic Republic of Congo at the edge of Lake Tanganyika, 
which I had been excited to discover we would be sharing with the famous Gustave, a 20-foot, 2,000-pound 
crocodile rumoured to have killed as many as 300 people.
The problem was that the driver, who had seemed in good spirits until this point, did not appear to appreciate being 
asked to speed up - not one bit, in fact. He seemed somehow offended by the request. We watched in horror from 
the back of the bus as his demeanour turned to rage: gesticulations, shouting, and then foot flat on the gas.
"Buhoro, buhoro! [slow down, slow down!]" my sister shrieked in her best Kinyarwanda as we barrelled round a 
blind corner. But this, unfortunately, only served to wind the driver up further, and he seemed to want to show us: 
keeping his pedal to the metal he now lifted his hands off the steering wheel and threw them in the air. I gripped the 
back of the seat in front of me as we ploughed through a village, terrified mothers grabbing their children out of the 
way of the careering bus. We arrived at the Bujumbura bus station with legs

of jelly and dripping sweat, to be greeted by swarms of mosquitoes and ominous thunder clouds. I spent the next 
four days looking out for Gustave, reading about the horrors that King Leopold of Belgium brought to what is now 
the DRC, and thinking a lot about our journey back to Kigali.
Madison Darbyshire FT US investment correspondent I have one superstition, and it is that Rome is where 
relationships go to die.
My relationship perished there, on a romantic mini break. But it became a superstition when friends would tell me: I 
just had "your" trip to Rome. Meaning, they went to Rome and returned with a smouldering husk of a romance.
The trouble with Rome is that it is a city designed to be in love in. And when you're not in love, it feels obvious.
When all you have to do is wander through piazzas and gaze at cathedrals, eat four gelatos a day and languish 
over marathon meals, it is apparent when you've run out of things to talk about beyond what you can see. The 
sound of forks scraping spaghetti from plates felt desolate as we discussed the couples at other tables - a lifetime 
away from when he had kissed me outside a hectic train station at midnight, and we could have been the only two 
people in the world.
At dinner on our final evening, he took me to a restaurant where he had celebrated his birthday the year before. We 
had the same waitress, they exchanged witty repartee in Italian that I didn't need to understand to understand. They 
looked so cute together. He made her belly-laugh. I found myself wishing he would have the courage to ask for her 
number. It simultaneously occurred to me that this is not what you are supposed to want for the man you are dating.
Both of my children got hand-foot-and-mouth disease, a nightmare of screaming, Popsicles, and pink antibiotic

Dublin, Ireland welcomes High Court night-flight decision

Dublin International airport operator Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) has welcomed a decision by Ireland's High Court 
to pause a local council order that would have forced it to limit night-time flights from September pending a full 
hearing on the matter.
The DAA's challenge legal against the enforcement order will be heard next on November 14, the court's website 
showed.
"While today's decision does not solve the underlying planning issues, it is a pragmatic decision while we focus on 
maintaining vital international air connectivity," DAA CEO Kenny Jacobs said on the day of the ruling, August 8. 
"Balancing the needs of a major international airport like Dublin with the needs of local communities and residents 
is always a delicate matter, but one we take extremely seriously."
Pressured by local residents who said their health was being affected, Fingal County Council had given the 
authority six weeks to comply with planning rules for a second runway capping the total number of incoming and 
outbound flights at 2300L (2200Z) and 0700L (0600Z) at 65. Ryanair (FR, Dublin International) claimed it faced 
"mass cancellations" if the order was to be enforced as its first wave of daily flights departs between 0600L and 
0700L. It suggested narrowing the restriction period to between 0000L and 0600L.
Nevertheless, the judge said that the county council could go to court on 48 hours' notice to the DAA and seek to 
have the stay either removed or changed.
"The DAA has been seeking the removal of two onerous planning conditions since 2007," Jacobs said. "The 
conditions attached to the initial grant for planning the North Runway, granted over 16 years ago, reflected the 
situation at that time which is vastly different to current operations. Modern aircraft are dramatically quieter than 16 
years ago for a start, and the Ryanair and Aer Lingus fleets include a large number of new planes which are 50% 
quieter. It is imperative now that this matter is brought to a speedy and successful conclusion in the national 
interest."

Nevertheless, the judge said that the county council could go to court on 48 hours' notice to the DAA and seek to 
have the stay either removed or changed.
"The DAA has been seeking the removal of two onerous planning conditions since 2007," Jacobs said. "The 
conditions attached to the initial grant for planning the North Runway, granted over 16 years ago, reflected the 
situation at that time which is vastly different to current operations. Modern aircraft are dramatically quieter than 16 
years ago for a start, and the Ryanair and Aer Lingus fleets include a large number of new planes which are 50% 
quieter. It is imperative now that this matter is brought to a speedy and successful conclusion in the national 
interest."

Ryanair Group's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Eddie Wilson has expressed criticism for the newly introduced ticket 
price caps on domestic flights in Italy, comparing them to methods the Soviets used in the 1920s.
"It's ridiculous, illegal, and interferes with the free market, according to European law," Wilson said in an interview 
with the Italian news agency Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata (ANSA). The executive argued that if the 
measure is not canceled, it would impact the low-cost carrier's ability to operate in the country.
In a separate interview with Italy's La Republica, Wilson said that "even Harry Potter knows" that "to reduce prices, 
you need to increase the number of seats". Ryanair's CEO added that the measure compares to "the Soviet Union 
in 1927", and that the low-cost carrier will appeal the measure in front of the European Commission (EC), deeming 
it to be "illegitimate".
On August 7, 2023, the Council of Ministers of Italy adopted the measure to cap ticket prices on domestic flights to 
Italy's islands. Part of the Urgent provisions to protect users and regarding economic activities and strategic 
investments decree/law, the bill aimed to fight "expensive flights"
The cap bans airlines from using dynamic pricing on flights during the peak period of demand linked to seasonality 
or during a national emergency, which would lead to the price of a ticket rising by 200% compared to the average 
fare. In addition, the law prohibits airlines from using "automated ticket pricing procedures" on domestic flights 
from/to Italy's islands based on the passenger's device and/or previous browsing activities.
"The companies must always inform the user, for online ticket purchases, about the use of profiling tools," the law's 
text continued.
During its Q1 FY24 presentation, the airline outlined that it has the largest market share in Italy with 38%, with ITA 
Airways and easyJet its biggest competitors in the country. Compared to the summer 2019 season, the airline has 
gained an additional 12% market share in Italy, noted Ryanair.
Currently, Ryanair operates domestic flights between mainland Italy and its islands from two airports in Sardinia, 
Alghero Fertilia Airport (AHO) and Cagliari Emas Airport (CAG), and three from Sicily, namely Trapani Birgi Airport

Tensions between Europe's online travel groups and Ryanair are rising after the booking agents called on UK 
regulators to probe the carrier's data requirements for passengers who do not book directly through its website. A 
group of companies including www.Booking.com, Expedia and Skyscanner wrote to the UK government and 
regulators on Wednesday to raise concerns over Ryanair's "invasive, unnecessary and unfair" treatment of 
customers.
In the letter to agencies including the Civil Aviation Authority and the Information Commissioner's Office, the 
companies said Ryanair forced many customers booking through third-party sites to hand over significant personal 
information in a complex process, including facial verification, to manage their booking or check in online.
"Ryanair may be breaching UK data protection rules which require data collection to be necessary and kept to a 
minimum, which is clearly not the case with these additional checks," the companies said in the letter.
The groups "assumed" Ryanair's "real motivation" for the checks, only applied to customers booking with agents, 
was to push passengers into booking direct with the airline next time.
Ryanair said its goal was "to be able to communicate with passengers directly ... in order to comply with our legal 
obligations and to allow passengers to correct their contact details so that we can meet any customer needs".
The airline said it did not have access to customers' email addresses or payment details if they booked through an 
online agent. This forced the airline to verify their identities in compliance with regulatory protocols.
Online agents seek probe of Ryanair data stipulations; Travel & leisure
Ryanair said its model was "dependent" on direct online sales to customers, and "many" online travel agents 
"missell" its flights, including adding markups such as inflated baggage or seat fees.
The claim and counterclaim are the latest in a battle between Europe's largest airline and some of the region's 
leading online booking agents.
Ryanair has long criticised thirdparty booking companies for preventing it from dealing directly with customers, and 
has called on all passengers to book through its website.
Low-cost airlines prefer to deal with customers directly as they can sell them extra services - car hire, seat 
bookings, luggage space - during booking.
Ancillary revenues are critical to Ryanair's model, which is based on offering passengers the cheapest possible fare 
and charging for extras. The carrier made (EURO)1.18bn from ancillaries in its most recent quarter, a third of 
revenue.
The online travel groups said no other airline required customers to go through these checks and they had seen 
"significantly increased communication from customers affected by this issue".
The ICO said it "recognised the concerns raised" over Ryanair's collection of data, as well as "the stress and 
uncertainty experienced by customers".

regulators to probe the carrier's data requirements for passengers who do not book directly through its website. A 
group of companies including www.Booking.com, Expedia and Skyscanner wrote to the UK government and 
regulators on Wednesday to raise concerns over Ryanair's "invasive, unnecessary and unfair" treatment of 
customers.
In the letter to agencies including the Civil Aviation Authority and the Information Commissioner's Office, the 
companies said Ryanair forced many customers booking through third-party sites to hand over significant personal 
information in a complex process, including facial verification, to manage their booking or check in online.
"Ryanair may be breaching UK data protection rules which require data collection to be necessary and kept to a 
minimum, which is clearly not the case with these additional checks," the companies said in the letter.
The groups "assumed" Ryanair's "real motivation" for the checks, only applied to customers booking with agents, 
was to push passengers into booking direct with the airline next time.
Ryanair said its goal was "to be able to communicate with passengers directly ... in order to comply with our legal 
obligations and to allow passengers to correct their contact details so that we can meet any customer needs".
The airline said it did not have access to customers' email addresses or payment details if they booked through an 
online agent. This forced the airline to verify their identities in compliance with regulatory protocols.
Online agents seek probe of Ryanair data stipulations Travel & leisure
Ryanair said its model was "dependent" on direct online sales to customers, and "many" online travel agents 
"missell" its flights, including adding markups such as inflated baggage or seat fees.
The claim and counterclaim are the latest in a battle between Europe's largest airline and some of the region's 
leading online booking agents.
Ryanair has long criticised thirdparty booking companies for preventing it from dealing directly with customers, and 
has called on all passengers to book through its website.
Low-cost airlines prefer to deal with customers directly as they can sell them extra services - car hire, seat 
bookings, luggage space - during booking.
Ancillary revenues are critical to Ryanair's model, which is based on offering passengers the cheapest possible fare 
and charging for extras. The carrier made (EURO)1.18bn from ancillaries in its most recent quarter, a third of 
revenue.
The online travel groups said no other airline required customers to go through these checks and they had seen 
"significantly increased communication from customers affected by this issue".
The ICO said it "recognised the concerns raised" over Ryanair's collection of data, as well as "the stress and 
uncertainty experienced by customers".

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has in the past used a few choice words to talk about online travel agents (OTAs). 
Describing them as "pirates" is among the more repeatable.
Equally unflattering adjectives may have been used yesterday after a group of OTAs urged UK regulators to probe 
the airline's handling of data belonging to passengers who do not book directly via its website.
Yet the OTA challenge could easily backfire. OTAs including www.Booking.com claim that Ryanair passengers who 
book indirectly must undertake a complex identification process. This can include facial recognition. The process is 
"invasive", they claim.
Ryanair counters that OTAs sometimes do not pass on customers' correct email addresses and says that it must 
communicate directly with customers in the event of disruptions.
O'Leary has plenty of grievances to raise against OTAs in retaliation for this attack. These include claims that some 
package Ryanair flights with hotels and other services and then overcharge for its fares. He has urged regulators to 
probe the market.
But Ryanair has also long wanted to cut out any middlemen. It estimates that about 10 per cent of passengers book 
indirectly. If it achieves passenger forecasts this year, that would equate to more than 18mn people.
Customers who book directly are better-placed to buy "ancillary services". These range from food to insurance. In 
the year ending in March, such sales accounted for 36 per cent of Ryanair's (EURO)10.78bn of revenue. They help 
Ryanair /travel agents: face off Twitter : @FTLEX
to smooth finances in years when fares are lowered or costs rise. Ryanair forecasts that costs, excluding fuel, will 
increase by about 6 per cent this year.
The concerns OTAs have that the identification processes will make customers reluctant to book with them are 
valid. But even if regulators intervene, much of the damage may already have been done. Passengers try to avoid 
repeating previous bad experiences, regardless of fault.

 A group of European online travel companies has requested UK regulators to probe Ryanair's (RYA.IR) "invasive, 
unnecessary, and unfair" treatment of customers who do not book directly through the budget airline's website.
The companies sent a letter to government agencies including the Civil Aviation Authority and Information 
Commissioner's office saying Ryanair forces customers using third-party websites to submit significant personal 
data, London's Financial Times reported Thursday.
The group said the airline could possibly be "breaching UK data protection rules."
Ryanair closed more than 2% lower on Wednesday.

Putin's war has already punished profits but more pain lies ahead
Putin's war has already punished profits but more pain lies ahead

W hen historians come to write about the lasting impacts of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, they should leaf through 
the annual reports of European companies.
The Financial Times reported on Sunday that Europe's biggest businesses had so far taken a direct hit of more 
than (EURO)100bn to profits as a result of quitting or scaling back their Russian operations. In fact, this is merely a 
fraction of the true cost.
Of the 609 annual reports and financial statements we examined, 176 companies took one-off charges. But even in 
the statements of the 433 that took no charges, almost all mentioned the punishing hit to profits of either soaring 
energy and raw material prices or supply chain disruptions that followed Russia's aggression last year. Many also 
mentioned a notable increase in cyber attacks. Others said consumers were moving away from environmentally 
sustainable products to save money at a time of record inflation.
Some were comprehensive in their descriptions. Dutch supermarket group Ahold Delhaize spoke of "rising costs 
across the value chain ... supply chain delays and labour shortages". These developments had hit "balance sheet 
valuations, results and cash flow.
Increasing interest rates mainly impacts the company's lease liabilities, pension obligations and self-insurance 
provision, and rising prices increases pressure on the profit margins." In other words, hardly a corner of the 
business was left untouched.
Putin's war has already punished profits but more pain lies ahead
Quantifying the actual cost of those indirect impacts is almost impossible. But a few companies - especially those 
with little or no presence in Russia - tried to explain just how extensive the damage was.
Saint-Gobain, the building materials group, said it had suffered a year-onyear rise of about (EURO)3bn in energy 
and raw materials costs.
Telia, the Swedish telecoms company, said its energy costs had risen by SKr800mn ($74.5mn) in 2022. Ryanair 
estimated it would lose up to 2mn passengers in 2023 as a result of cancelling all flights to and from Ukraine.
'There is more unpredictability volatility. We come to grips difficult driving
Georg Fischer, the Swiss piping company, noted that the war had caused energy prices to rise by 100 per cent in 
2022; an increase of just 25 per cent in its energy bill would result in about SFr17mn ($19.4mn) in extra costs, 
constituting "a critical financial impact".
None declared any one-off charges or impairments in their annual reports. But it is clear that the impact on many 
European businesses of Russia's aggression will be deeper and longerlasting than the costs of quitting a relatively 
minor market. Russia accounted for just 3 per cent of global turnover of the listed foreign companies present in the 
country before the war, according to the Kyiv School of Economics.
Yet whether or not a business was present in Russia, many are now preparing for long-term volatility and 
uncertainty. Russia accounted for about a third of revenues at Technip Energies, the French energy services 
provider. While the group has been able to replace much of the lost income by focusing on new geographies, chief 
financial officer Bruno Vibert says management now has to be much more flexible and agile. The Russian 
experience has also raised questions about the risks in other markets, such as China.
"There is more unpredictability and volatility," he says. "We have to come to grips in the near future with very 
difficult driving forces."
Meanwhile, those with well-known brands are realising that they remain exposed in other ways. "For most 
companies the value of the brand is bigger than the value of any Russia assets," says Nabi Abdullaev, partner at 
strategic consultancy Control Risks.
So what happens if their products are associated with senior Russian politicians or soldiers? Even if they have 
stopped supplying that market, wellknown brands still find their way to Russian shops via third-party importers. "If 
the media picks up on [President Vladimir] Putin using a western branded product, the damage to that company's 
market value may be more than its Russian assets," says Abdullaev.
European companies have already taken a big hit to profits as a result of Russia's invasion - and this is not the end 
of the story. Yet if Putin is to be stopped, this price must be paid. Successful businesses know how to adapt. It may 
be that the longest-lasting consequence of the war for European business will be to make it more efficient and 
competitive.

(ANSA) - AUG 9 - Ryanair CEO Eddie Wilson on Wednesday called for the measure the Italian government 
presented this week to combat high flight prices to be scrapped. "It's ridiculous, illegal and interferes with the free 
market, according to European law," Wilson told ANSA. 
"It must be cancelled. "If it isn't, there will be an impact on Ryanair's ability to operate in Italy". A decree approved 
by the cabinet on Monday clamps down on the use of algorithms to set flight prices. The government blamed the 
algorithms for soaring prices in recent months, especially for services connecting the mainland to Sicily and 
Sardinia The decree bans the algorithms if applied to connections to Sicily and Sardinia; if applied to peaks in 
demand linked to seasonal factors; and if they lead to the price of tickets or accessory services being 200% higher 
than the average price. Wilson added that Sicily Governor Renato Schifani's assertion that Ryanair was involved in 
a price cartel was "nothing but rubbish. "Ryanair has reached over 185 million passengers because we lowered 
prices and give them value," he said. "We don't need to talk to incompetent companies". Wilson had a meeting with 
Business and Made in Italy Minister Adolfo Urso earlier on Wednesday. "The Ryanair CEO presented the important 
development plans (the company) has for the country and the problems it faces," Urso said. "I am willing to meet 
other companies to see whether the measure can be improved during its conversion into law in parliament".

efficiently. This personalized approach enhances your travel experience and reinforces Ryanair France's 
commitment to putting its customers first.
How does Ryanair France's pricing strategy differ from traditional airlines?
Well, this is one of the exciting questions that must be answered logically with real characteristics. Let's break it 
down. 
Ryanair France's pricing strategy differs significantly from that of traditional airlines, revolutionizing the way 
travelers approach booking flights in Europe. 
Low-Cost Model : Ryanair France is a pioneer in the low-cost airline industry, employing a no-frills approach to keep 
operational costs down. Unlike conventional airlines that bundle various services into their ticket prices, it offers a 
base fare that covers the essential components of a flight, such as seat and cabin crew services. 
On the other hand, passengers also have the option to customize their experience by adding extras like baggage 
allowance, priority boarding, and in-flight refreshments, but these come with additional fees. This unbundled pricing 
model lets passengers pay only for the services they actually need. 
Extensive Network of Secondary Airports : Their primary objective is to go lower as much as possible to facilitate 
customers. In order to further reduce costs, Ryanair France often operates from secondary airports, which are 
located outside major cities. 
These airports generally have lower landing fees and operational expenses than primary airports, allowing them to 
pass on the savings to their passengers through lower ticket prices. While this may mean travelers need to consider 
additional travel arrangements to reach their final destinations, still, in most cases, it is proven to be cost-efficient. 
Dynamic Pricing and Yield Management : The airline employs dynamic pricing and yield management methods to 
adjust fares in response to demand and other market factors. Its pricing system can be quite fluid, with fares 
fluctuating based on booking date, time of day, and seat availability. This strategy encourages passengers to book 
early to secure the best fares while maintaining flexibility for last-minute bookings or spontaneous trips.
Promotional Offers: Like any other services, airlines also offer discounted flights, but their discount rate varies, and 
sometime it may not be beneficial as it seems. Talking about Ryanair France, the unique thing is, gives their 
customers regular promotional deals with enticing discounts and special fares. These promotions include flash 
sales, seasonal discounts, or targeted offers to specific destinations. In order to be the one to book a flight at a low 
cost, you have to subscribe to Ryanair France's mailing list. This is the best you can do.

FAQs

regarding their services, offers, and current flight schedules or want to lodge a complaint. You can surely get instant 
responses from the respondents.

 Teesside Airport has seen its busiest month in more than a decade. June saw a total of 25,666 passengers pass 
through the terminal, the highest figure since September 2010. 
July was also a bumper month, with 24,781 people choosing Teesside. An enhanced package of holiday flights has 
bolstered the airport's summer programme. 
Hundreds of families have jetted off for some 'much-needed sun' with the airport enjoying its busiest day since 
returning to public ownership in late July. It means Teesside is on course to record its highest annual passenger 
numbers since 2011. 
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen commented: 'These figures show we are well and truly heading in the right 
direction when it comes to making our airport a success. But we know there is still a very long way to go. Breaching 
the 25,000 figure is good, but we have ambitions to be hitting that every single week. 
'The people of Teesside, Darlington and Hartlepool have supported us - and we couldn't have achieved what we 
have without them. Our airport is a sleeping giant awaking from its slumber. We know what people are crying out 
for, and we will continue to strain every sinew to attract new holiday flights and routes. 
'Our new business park, freight facility and Freeport status will all have their roles to play in returning our airport to 
profit. The ten-year plan is working and we've an exciting future ahead.' 
Holiday hotspots with airline Ryanair to Alicante, Faro in Portugal, Majorca, and Corfu have proved popular. TUI 
has also expanded its offering from Teesside this year, with twice-weekly flights to Majorca thanks to the popularity 
of the route last year and a service to Antalya, Turkey. 
Balkan Holidays is also operating to Bourgas, Bulgaria, and holidaymakers are using KLM's three-times daily 
service to Amsterdam Schiphol, serving 200 onward global destinations. 
Phil Forster, Teesside Airport managing director, added: 'These figures are a big boost and it's been a real pleasure 
to hear the great feedback from passengers about their experiences. We're really making Teesside an airport to be 
proud of. 
Teesside International Airport celebrates busiest month in 'more than a decade'
'Our staff are second to none, and I'd like to thank them for all their hard work in helping us hit this new high. I've 
heard so many positive things about how our teams have offered a great service, even when passenger numbers 
and demand have risen quickly.'

Ryanair blasts Dublin night-flight crackdown

Ryanair (FR, Dublin International) has called on Ireland's transport minister, Eamon Ryan, to take "urgent action" to 
halt a "stupid decision" to cut the number of night-time flights at Dublin airport with six weeks' notice.
Fingal County Council, the local authority that governs the area to the north of the Irish capital where the airport is 
located, has issued airport operator Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) with an enforcement notice giving it six weeks to 
comply with planning rules capping the number of flights at 2300L and 0700L (2200-0600Z) at 65.
Residents living near the flight path complain that their sleep is being severely disrupted and that aircraft noise 
increased when a second runway opened in August 2022 at a cost of EUR320 million euros (USD352 million). The 
cap was among the planning conditions imposed when the new North Runway was greenlighted in 2007.
However, the DAA has long opposed the night-flight limit, and chief executive Kenny Jacobs claims that 
enforcement will bring disruption for passengers close to the peak holiday season. With it, there will be fewer flights 
between 2300L and 0700L than was the case before the second runway opened, he said.
According to Ryanair, the municipality "cannot be allowed to dictate national aviation policy or restrict flights to/from 
Ireland at our national airport." It added that "the airport will now be restricted to fewer flights than there were when 
there was only one runway."
It suggested that Ryan shift the night-time restriction period to 1200L-0600L, which "would avoid disruption to the 
vast majority of first-wave flights which depart Dublin between 0600L and 0700L [and] allow Transatlantic flights 
which arrive early to land before the 6am curfew but would not result in significant flight restrictions."
Fingal council "and a tiny number of neighbours cannot be allowed to damage or restrict air travel or connectivity 
to/from Ireland," the carrier said.
Sabrina Joyce Kemper of the Fingal Organised Residents United Movement (Forum) told BBC News NI that the 
campaign was only asking for the existing rules to be obeyed. Ryanair is acting like a "petulant teenager", she said, 
and has "no real grasp" on how the noise affects thousands of residents young and old, raising health concerns 
about disturbed sleep patterns.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin International) has called on Ireland's transport minister, Eamon Ryan, to take "urgent action" to 
halt a "stupid decision" to cut the number of night-time flights at Dublin airport with six weeks' notice.
Fingal County Council, the local authority that governs the area to the north of the Irish capital where the airport is 
located, has issued airport operator Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) with an enforcement notice giving it six weeks to 
comply with planning rules capping the number of flights at 2300L and 0700L (2200-0600Z) at 65.
Residents living near the flight path complain that their sleep is being severely disrupted and that aircraft noise 
increased when a second runway opened in August 2022 at a cost of EUR320 million euros (USD352 million). The 
cap was among the planning conditions imposed when the new North Runway was greenlighted in 2007.
However, the DAA has long opposed the night-flight limit, and chief executive Kenny Jacobs claims that 
enforcement will bring disruption for passengers close to the peak holiday season. With it, there will be fewer flights 
between 2300L and 0700L than was the case before the second runway opened, he said.
According to Ryanair, the municipality "cannot be allowed to dictate national aviation policy or restrict flights to/from

Signal: China announces new regulations for facial recognition technology in public spaces
Signal: China announces new regulations for facial recognition technology

Highlight: The Cyberspace Administration of China has drafted new regulations over the use of facial recognition 
technology in public safety.
Body
Facial recognition is currently used in China to verify identities and citizen biometric data is currently stored in the 
National Basic Population Information Database.  The regulations state that individual consent must be acquired 
from citizens to collect and use their biometric information. In addition to this, the administration explicitly states that 
image collection devices must not be placed in public bathrooms, hotel rooms or "other places that may infringe on 
the privacy of others."  The regulations also lay out clear guidelines for businesses planning to use facial 
recognition technology.  Businesses such as hotels, art galleries or airports must not use facial recognition to verify 
customers' identities unless they are required to do so by law to run their businesses. Businesses must also not 
coerce or mislead customers to wrongfully consent to facial recognition.  Is facial recognition more commonplace in 
China than elsewhere?
Facial recognition is met with widespread criticism for its potential for use in surveillance states and autocratic 
regimes.   China has especially been met with scrutiny after a 2019 database leak found that 6.8 million pieces of 
biometric data had been recorded around public spaces.  Criticism over the use of facial technology has also been 
applied to Western companies, such as Ryanair who have used the technology to verify customer identity in its 
online booking system. UK supermarkets have also been criticised for their use of facial recognition, as reported by 
The Telegraph.  Whilst a 2023 working paper found that China was the biggest exporter of facial recognition 
technology around the world, whilst the US was the second largest exporter of facial recognition technology.   
According to GlobalData's jobs analytics database, China was the fourth biggest hirer in Artificial Intelligence behind 
the US, India and Germany.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void

Boeing deliveries are still far from stable
Boeing deliveries are still far from stable

Aug 08, 2023( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Boeing's[1] aim to stabilize 737/MAX production and deliveries (and that of other models) hasn't quite worked out in 
July. At 43 deliveries, the number was lower than that of June, when the airframer dispatched 60 aircraft to lessors 
and airlines. Boeing deliveries are still far from stable. 
The focus is mainly of the two models that have been plagued by recent delivery delays: the 737/MAX and the 787. 
July saw one 737 P-8A and 32 MAX deliveries, with United Airlines taking nine, Southwest seven, and Ryanair four 
aircraft for the majority of deliveries. India's Akasa Air became the second airline after Ryanair to take a (leased) 
MAX 8200 (main picture). 
The July number compares to one P-8A and 48 MAX in June, one P-8A and 35 MAX in May, and one P-8A and 
seventeen MAX in April. April and May's deliveries were impacted by rework required on correcting tailfin fittings on 
aircraft in inventory and production. For March, February, and January, the delivery split between 737 P-8s and 
MAX was 1/52, 1/24, and 35 (MAX only). 
The numbers confirm that deliveries are well off the stable pattern of on average 35 per month that Boeing hoped to 
achieve by now before accelerating to a production rate of 38 per month. But as Chief Financial Officer Brian West 
said during theQ2/HY1 earnings call[2] on July 26: 'It will take some months before we will see a stable 38 aircraft 
coming off the line.' 
Fuselage supplierSpirit AeroSystems[3] said last week that it is producing 38 frames a month this August and will 
remain at this level until early 2024. This might include delivering frames from its Wichita inventory as the company 
is trying to catch up from the effects of the eleven-day strike in June/July over a new labor contract. Spirit said full-
year deliveries to Boeing will fall behind by a margin of -20 to -50 frames compared to the planned schedule of 
between 370-390 in total. 
Dreamliner 
Dreamliner deliveries were also much lower than in previous months and stood at just four in July compared to six 
in June, eight in May, six in April, seven in March, three in February, and three in January. So there is no stability 
either here yet, with Boeing still having joint verification rework to do on multiple areas of the aircraft on in inventory. 
There were 85 of them by the end of June, so this must have come down to 81 by the end of July. 
Boeing deliveries are still far from stable
The 767-300F/KC-46 and 777F saw three deliveries of each family member in July compared to 4/1 in June, 3/3 in 
May, 1/1 in April, 1/3 in March, and 0/0 in February and January. 
Through July, Boeing has delivered 309 aircraft, of which 249 737/MAX. The full-year target is 400-450 737/MAX 
and 70-80 Dreamliners. 
Orders 
Boeing reported 52 gross orders for July, including a confirmation of the previously announced Dreamliner order 
from Saudia. The carrier ordered eighteen 787-9s and 21 -10s. There were twelve MAX orders, four from Luxair 
and eight from undisclosed customers. July saw no cancelations. 
Forty aircraft previously listed under ASC606 Adjustments as deliveries were uncertain have moved to the 
confirmed backlog, including 42 MAX. Two Dreamliners entered ASC606. Year to date, Boeing has won 659 net 
orders, of which 467 are new and 192 re-entered the backlog from ASC606. The total backlog stands at 4.928 
aircraft.

Highlight: Zoom has announced that it will use service generated data, rather than user data, from new AI meeting 
tools to train its AI models for improved user experience.
Body
The company has already invested in Anthropic and introduced new AI tools that summarise meetings and 
compose message drafts.  The changes, originally announced in March 2023, clarify that Zoom can provide these 
services without questions of usage rights.  However, whilst Zoom has explicitly clarified that it will not train its AI on 
data without user consent, the company has not included an opt-out clause.  Senior analyst at GlobalData, Maya 
Sherman, has pointed out that this update "highlights numerous ethical concerns" posed by using service or user 
data for AI training. Sherman states that being able to opt-out is an essential pillar of GDPR regulations that enable 
consumer trust and consent. Since many AI tools are still liable to technical errors, Sherman believes that user data 
will therefore be put at risk in unclear policy updates.  "Due to the black box structure of AI algorithms," Sherman 
comments, "the risk that [service generated] data will be used by third parties, leaked or modified to amplify biases 
is alarming and should be moderated."  In a hyper-connected world, Sherman warns that even indirect metadata 
can be used for malign purposes against users.  Amongst the backdrop of biometrics increasingly being used by 
companies like Ryanair and AI regulation being written up globally, Sherman concludes that company data 
behaviour and digital hygiene is under increasing ethical scrutiny.  Sherman states that Zoom's original policies 
should have been released with clear company intentions without waiting for online opponents to point out its flaws.  
User trust, Sherman concludes, is crucial in data protection and Zoom could be at risk of seeing a decrease in their 
subscription numbers due to potential distrust this policy may have caused.  Verdict has contacted Zoom for 
comment.

W hen I read last week that Britain's prime minister, Rishi Sunak, was about to head off on his first proper family 
holiday in four years, I felt a rush of incredulity.
Surely even the most dreary workaholic striver would have been able to get away at some point in that time.
Yes, it would have been impossible in the depths of the pandemic for Sunak, who became a Treasury minister in 
July 2019, chancellor in February 2020 and prime minister in October last year. And yes, I believe the press aide 
who told reporters Sunak tried to take a break on a Spanish island after losing the Tory leadership contest to Liz 
Truss last year, but had to race back after about 15 hours when the Queen died.
But still. Four years? Advertising this sort of family holiday failure is seriously odd, not least because it manages to 
invite both suspicion and resentment.
Plenty of people do not take as much vacation as they are entitled to or need. But that is because many can't. They 
may live in a notorious no-vacationnation such as the US, the only advanced economy that does not guarantee 
workers paid holidays.
Or they might have a manager who pressures them to keep working. Or they might be poor.
Sun, surf - and the politics of taking a holiday
Even in the relatively wealthy EU, 29 per cent of citizens could not afford a one week holiday away from home last 
year, official data shows. That's down from 40 per cent in 2013, so things are improving. But the figure soars among 
the poorest, as it does outside the EU, and it's not necessarily because people are retired or unemployed.
"I haven't had a holiday for 13 years," a British woman in her 50s with three low-paying jobs told researchers 
studying the rise of in-work poverty before the pandemic. "In fact, if I can, I take annual leave so I can work 
somewhere else."
The point here is not that Rishi Sunak is one of the wealthiest prime ministers the UK has ever had. The more 
relevant fact is that, pandemic aside, he has considerably more freedom to go on a family holiday if he chooses 
than many of those he leads.
Of course, this assumes he actively wants to go on such a vacation. Many people do not. Margaret Thatcher was 
famously not fond of holidaying. Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed to be phenomenally anti-vacation.
Michael O'Leary, the voluble chief executive of budget airline Ryanair, once told me he only went on family beach 
holidays because he had to, and could tolerate building sandcastles with the kids for precisely five minutes. "After 
that it's, 'Oh Jesus, will someone come and rescue me!' I'm praying for a crisis."
There is no great shame in this. A lot of successful leaders feel the same way. One long-running study by Harvard 
Business School academics of how chief executives of large companies spend their time, found they worked on 70 
per cent of their vacation days, for an average of more than two hours a day.
It would not be a massive shock if a renowned micromanager such as Sunak, a former Goldman Sachs man with a 
reputation for workaholic tendencies, also struggled to switch off on a family break.
If he does, though, I'd rather he said so. Instead, we are supposed to believe, in the words of his press secretary, 
that "the PM believes that work-life balance is very important, particularly spending time with your family, especially 
if you have young kids". But also, he is not necessarily "a good example of practising what you preach".
As with much else about Rishi Sunak, it is difficult to know exactly what he thinks.
Still, I am glad he is finally going on a holiday, to California, with his wife and two young daughters, and I hope they 
all have an enjoyable time. This is not guaranteed. Politicians' holidays often go badly. If they're not being criticised 
for being too posh or too dull, they are interrupted by events back home.
With luck, that will not happen to
Sunak this year and not just for his own sake. As a pandemic-scarred workforce reports rising levels of burnout, he 
is setting an excellent, if belated, example. I hope it's followed by many more like it.

W hen I read last week that Britain's prime minister, Rishi Sunak, was about to head off on his first proper family 
holiday in four years, I felt a rush of incredulity.
Surely even the most dreary workaholic striver would have been able to get away at some point in that time.
Yes, it would have been impossible in the depths of the pandemic for Sunak, who became a Treasury minister in 
July 2019, chancellor in February 2020 and prime minister in October last year. And yes, I believe the press aide 
who told reporters Sunak tried to take a break on a Spanish island after losing the Tory leadership contest to Liz 
Truss last year, but had to race back after about 15 hours when the Queen died.
But still. Four years? Advertising this sort of family holiday failure is seriously odd, not least because it manages to 
invite both suspicion and resentment.
Plenty of people do not take as much vacation as they are entitled to or need. But that is because many can't. They 
may live in a notorious no-vacationnation such as the US, the only advanced economy that does not guarantee 
workers paid holidays.
Or they might have a manager who pressures them to keep working. Or they might be poor.
Sun, surf - and the politics of taking a holiday
Even in the relatively wealthy EU, 29 per cent of citizens could not afford a one week holiday away from home last 
year, official data shows. That's down from 40 per cent in 2013, so things are improving. But the figure soars among 
the poorest, as it does outside the EU, and it's not necessarily because people are retired or unemployed.
"I haven't had a holiday for 13 years," a British woman in her 50s with three low-paying jobs told researchers 
studying the rise of in-work poverty before the pandemic. "In fact, if I can, I take annual leave so I can work 
somewhere else."
The point here is not that Rishi Sunak is one of the wealthiest prime ministers the UK has ever had. The more 
relevant fact is that, pandemic aside, he has considerably more freedom to go on a family holiday if he chooses 
than many of those he leads.
Of course, this assumes he actively wants to go on such a vacation. Many people do not. Margaret Thatcher was 
famously not fond of holidaying. Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed to be phenomenally anti-vacation.
Michael O'Leary, the voluble chief executive of budget airline Ryanair, once told me he only went on family beach 
holidays because he had to, and could tolerate building sandcastles with the kids for precisely five minutes. "After 
that it's, 'Oh Jesus, will someone come and rescue me!' I'm praying for a crisis."
There is no great shame in this. A lot of successful leaders feel the same way. One long-running study by Harvard 
Business School academics of how chief executives of large companies spend their time, found they worked on 70 
per cent of their vacation days, for an average of more than two hours a day.
It would not be a massive shock if a renowned micromanager such as Sunak, a former Goldman Sachs man with a 
reputation for workaholic tendencies, also struggled to switch off on a family break.
If he does, though, I'd rather he said so. Instead, we are supposed to believe, in the words of his press secretary, 
that "the PM believes that work-life balance is very important, particularly spending time with your family, especially 
if you have young kids". But also, he is not necessarily "a good example of practising what you preach".
As with much else about Rishi Sunak, it is difficult to know exactly what he thinks.
Still, I am glad he is finally going on a holiday, to California, with his wife and two young daughters, and I hope they 
all have an enjoyable time. This is not guaranteed. Politicians' holidays often go badly. If they're not being criticised 
for being too posh or too dull, they are interrupted by events back home.
With luck, that will not happen to
Sunak this year and not just for his own sake. As a pandemic-scarred workforce reports rising levels of burnout, he 
is setting an excellent, if belated, example. I hope it's followed by many more like it.

Monday.
The ACV Puls and CNE unions said no acceptable proposal from the airline has been received for higher 
compensation and better working conditions, adding that the company has only offered "threats and illegal 
proposals."
In July, Ryanair pilots staged two two-day strikes at the Charleroi Airport.

Budget airlines' add-on fees in question as ancillary revenues jump
Budget airlines' add-on fees in question as ancillary revenues jump

Budget airlines are being investigated in Spain over additional fees charged to passengers, such as for hand 
luggage, after several have penned growing ancillary revenue recently.
Fines worth up to (EURO)1 billion (£0.86 billion) euros could be dealt as a result of the probe, the Spanish Ministry 
of Consumer Affairs said on Thursday, which will focus on how customers are often charged more than the 
advertised price of airline tickets due to add-on costs.
Though the ministry did not name any specific airlines being investigated, the practice of charging extra for the likes 
of hand luggage, priority boarding, and seat selection is common among budget carriers.
Battle of the budget airlines
Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) and easyJet PLC, for instance, score a significant proportion of revenue through 
these ancillary costs, with both seeing marked increases in their latest respective quarters.
Ancillary sales generated a total of (EURO)1.18 billion for the Irish carrier during the first quarter-up 15%-of total 
revenue worth (EURO)3.65 billion.
easyJet marked a 28% increase in ancillary revenue in its latest quarterly results meanwhile, to £622 million, as 
passenger revenue climbed to £1.5 billion.
Per average passenger, Ryanair made (EURO)23.30 (£20.08) in ancillary revenue in the three months to June, 
while easyJet gained £23.75.
Budget airlines' add-on fees in question as ancillary revenues jump
Given a flight between London Gatwick and Alicante in Spain on the same date in late August costs around £75 
with each carrier-as per each company's websites-roughly a quarter of the revenue per passenger could come from 
such costs.
A 2019 Spanish court ruling dubbed Ryanair's hand baggage fee policy as "abusive," though the Irish airline argued 
airlines have commercial freedom to determine cabin luggage sizes.
"[Airlines] offer in their advertisement very competitive prices," the ministry added as its investigation was launched 
earlier this week.
However, these often "do not correspond in most cases with the price that the consumer ends up paying, as a 
consequence of these practices".

Amazon reports better-than-expected revenue and profits for 2Q, sending its stock higher
Amazon reports better-than-expected revenue and profits for 2Q, sending its 
stock higher

NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon on Thursday posted better-than-expected revenue and profits for the second quarter, 
sending its stock higher in after-hours trading.
The e-commerce giant earned $6.7 billion, or 65 cents per share, for the three-month period ended June 30, much 
higher the $3.64 billion industry analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated.
Amazon had reported a loss during the same period last year, driven by a big loss on its investment in electric 
vehicle start-up Rivian Automotive. Its profits for the second quarter include a pre-tax valuation gain of $0.2 billion in 
its Rivian investment.
The company, which has been on a cost-cutting spree over the past few months, said overall revenue was $134.4 
billion, up 11% from the same period last year and beating analyst expectations of 8.5% growth.
“It was another strong quarter of progress for Amazon,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement.
Amazon's cloud unit AWS, which has been closely watched by investors, posted $22.1 billion in revenue.
Jassy said growth in the cloud business, which had slowed since last year as companies cut back on costs, 
“stabilized as customers started shifting from cost optimization to new workload deployment.”
AWS grew by 12%, slower than 16% in the first quarter and 33% during the same time last year. Part of the 
slowdown can be explained by the fact that AWS is the market leader in the cloud arena, which makes it 
challenging to sustain the higher levels of growth it had in the earlier days.
In an effort to lure in more customers and gain a competitive edge in the generative AI race where it seems to be 
playing catchup, the company has also been rolling out AI tools its customers can use to make their own 
applications. Last week, it said an AI model called Amazon Bedrock is being used by the Irish carrier Ryanair, 
among others.
Amazon reports better-than-expected revenue and profits for 2Q, sending its stock higher
Meanwhile, Amazon's flagship online retail business, which had slowed dramatically following a boom earlier in the 
pandemic, grew 5%, its best showing since the third quarter of last year.
Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s chief financial officer, said during a call with reporters on Thursday that consumers are 
still operating on tight budgets and trading down to more generic brands even in the upscale grocery chain Whole 
Foods, which is owned by Amazon.
Deliveries for customers who shop online are getting much faster under the retailer's new regionalization model. 
Previously, Amazon used to fulfill orders from warehouses across the country. But now, the company has eight 
regions across the country that are serving smaller areas, which helps it accomplish a twofold goal of cutting costs 
and getting items to its Prime customers quicker.
During the second quarter, more than half of Prime orders across the top 60 U.S. metro areas arrived the same day 
or the next, the company said Monday, touting what it called its fastest Prime speed ever. The company also 
publicized its plans to double the number of same-day delivery sites in the coming years.
Amazon's physical store sales, which includes its Amazon Fresh and Go stores as well as Whole Foods, grew 7%. 
The company has ambitions to be a major player in the grocery sector but hasn't grabbed significant market share 
since launching the Fresh and Go chain three years ago. It now operates dozens across the country.
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said earlier this year that groceries present a big growth opportunity for Amazon but the 
company needed to find the right “mass grocery format” worth expanding broadly.
On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported the company was planning to add an online service that would allow 
customers to integrate orders from Whole Foods and Amazon's other grocery stores into one cart. In a blog post, 
the company also provided a look at two revamped Fresh stores in Illinois that offer more product selections, self 
checkout and Krispy Kreme Doughnut shops. In addition to that, it has begun offering grocery deliveries for non-
Prime members.
The company said it expects to earn between $138 billion and $143 billion in revenue during the third quarter.

Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) the budget airline, posted over a 50% jump in first-quarter revenues, but shares 
in the group dropped by around 3% in early trading, reflecting investor's caution towards the industry despite strong 
signs of recovery.
Sales of (EURO)1.2 billion in the first three months of the 2024 financial year jumped from (EURO)808 million in 
2023, helping Wizz Air turn an underlying profit of (EURO)236 million compared to a loss of (EURO)154 million 
twelve months earlier, a company statement revealed.  
Maintaining its full-year net profit forecast and bringing in a record number of passengers during the quarter, it is 
difficult,as is for rivals Ryanair and EasyJet, to see this summer as anything but a win for airlines.
However, in the last month, the London-listed firm has tumbled more than 18% and Victoria Scholar, head of 
investment at Interactive Investor, believes "investors remain cautious towards the stock".
"There was investor anger at this week's annual meeting over chief executive Jozsef Varadi's £100 (million) bonus 
package with more than 25% of shareholders rejecting the proposals. Wizz Air was also voted the worst airline in 
Britain in a recent Which? survey of UK passengers this year," she said.
Guidance for capacity growth was lowered from 30% to 25%, at risk in the first half due to engine inspectionsand 
industry infrastructure constraints, which Liberum thinks could also dent second-half forecasts.
Liberum maintained its 'sell' rating on the airline and targets a 2,200p share price-current shares are trading at a 
little over 2,3000p on Thursday.
Wizz Air profits lift off but investors aren't convinced
"There may be short-term share price pressure from the lack of an upgrade, given the upgrades seen at other 
airlines this quarter," the UK broker added.

Investors in Wizz Air approved plans to give the company's boss an additional two years to unlock a bonus of 
£100mn, despite sizeable opposition at the low-cost carrier's annual meeting. Almost 30 per cent of the airline's 
freefloating shares was cast against a resolution to give József Váradi until 2028 to obtain the one-off award if Wizz 
Air's share price hits £120.
Shares closed down less than 1 per cent at £23.62 yesterday.
The amendment was approved with 74 per cent of the eligible votes supporting the resolution.
Wizz Air said its board believed that Váradi was "central to delivering [the airline's] recovery in the coming years" 
and the changes to remuneration plans were "in the best interests of the company, its shareholders and other 
stakeholders".
However, the proposal had encountered significant opposition from proxy advisers before the general meeting in 
Switzerland.
Institutional Shareholder Services said the plan was "not fully in line with UK good practice", while Pirc said the 
plans were "highly excessive" and "not considered to be acceptable".
Pirc argued that a share price was "often outside the control of individual directors and is often more affected by 
larger market changes".

Just under two-thirds of the votes at Wizz's annual meeting in 2021 were cast in favour of the bonus scheme, with 
about a third against, despite criticism from shareholder advisory groups.
This was because the vote was open only to a small proportion of investors after the airline was forced to water 
down the voting rights of shareholders from outside the European Economic Area, in order to comply with EU rules 
around airline ownership after Brexit.
Wizz Air's largest shareholder is US private equity firm Indigo Partners, which focuses on air transport and owns 24 
per cent of the company. Indigo's founder William Franke has been chair of Wizz Air for almost two decades.
The carrier has grown rapidly over the past five years, becoming one of the most significant companies in European 
aviation thanks to cheap fares made possible by an ultra low-cost business model.
The airline was one of the first carriers to recover to its pre-pandemic share price in late 2020, as investors backed 
its aggressive expansion plan. Its shares have halved since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year.
Wizz Air's move follows that of Ryanair, which extended and adjusted the comparable package for its chief 
executive, Michael O'Leary, last year.
Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at Barclays, said Wizz Air's move had the logic of following its lead rival, but Ryanair 
had also "included an increase to the target profit level required to trigger it".

RYANAIR and Wizz Air both yesterday reported soaring passenger numbers as the record breaking summer travel 
boom continued, with the Irish carrier making history by carrying over 18m guests for the first time in one month.
Ryanair's record breaking month saw its traffic grow 11 per cent from 16.8m the previous year.
Meanwhile its rival Wizz Air carried 6m passengers, representing a 26.6 per cent increase compared to July 2022.
Both low-cost carriers also saw strong load factors - the percentage of available seating capacity that has been 
filled with passengers - with Ryanair and Wizz Air reporting load factors of 96 per cent and 94.9 per cent 
respectively.
The results come amid a booming season of travel this summer, which has seen the aviation sector benefit from 
pent-up demand post-pandemic and resilient consumer spending on holidays despite the cost of living crisis.
Airlines have netted bumper profits so far, with Ryanair flying past pre-pandemic profit levels to £572m in the three 
months to June. It did, however, lower its passenger forecast for the rest of the year in the same announcement, 
citing Boeing delivery delays.
Meanwhile, long-haul specialist and British Airways' owner IAG netted a colossal (EURO)1.25bn (£1.07bn) profit, 
while Easyjet has forecast record profits for the rest of the peak season.
Shares in airlines have responded accordingly, with Ryanair, BA and Easyjet up 24, 42 and 12 per cent respectively 
over the last year.
Wizz Air will report its first quarter results today.
Ryanair hails record summer as Brits jet off
Conroy Gaynor, travel, leisure and retail analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, noted that "fuel prices, albeit volatile, 
look more favourable this year, so, along with a planned decrease in nonfuel unit costs, should help Wizz return to 
profit, with the company forecasting (EURO)350m-(EURO)450m for the year to March."

Is It Time to Buy the Nasdaq 's 5 Worst-Performing July Stocks?

August 3rd, 2023 ( The Motley Fool  — Delivered by  Newstex )
If you're a bargain-hunting growth investor, you might want to browse last month's Nasdaq -listed laggards. 
Although the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) itself logged a 4.1% gain in July, a bunch of its individual 
listings didn't follow suit. A few of them -- even some of its most popular large caps -- suffered double-digit 
percentage declines instead.
Or, perhaps these particular tickers tumbled for a reason and still have more downside in store to dish out. Let's 
take a look.
What went wrong for whom?
There's no need to belabor the point: Last's month's biggest losers among the Nasdaq's largest names are 
Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH), Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ: WLTW), and SolarEdge Technologies 
(NASDAQ: SEDG). These stocks lost 9.4%, 10.3%, and 10.3% of their value in July, respectively. (Dis)honorable 
mentions go to Ryanair Holdings (NASDAQ: RYAAY) and American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL), which fell 7.3% and 
6.7% last month in spite of a turnaround effort late in the month.
^IXIC  data by YCharts
In most cases, these kinds of setbacks aren't in and of themselves reasons to buy a stock. Such weakness is often 
just a reflection of fundamental trouble, after all.
Take Enphase Energy as an example. The bulk of its July stumble took shape in response to its third-quarter 
guidance, published in conjunction with its second-quarter results. Although sales of $711.1 million were up 34% 
year over year and per-share earnings improved to the tune of 37%, sales fell short of estimates .
Guidance for the quarter now underway was also lackluster, suggesting demand for solar power equipment isn't 
living up to expectations. SolarEdge hadn't yet reported last quarter's results but fell all the same on worries that it 
too is running into a demand headwind.
Is It Time to Buy the Nasdaq 's 5 Worst-Performing July Stocks?
Shares of London-based insurance company Willis Towers Watson nosedived for a similar reason. That is, while 
revenue of $2.2 billion was up 6% and better than anticipated, earnings of $2.05 per share were down 12% year 
over year, falling short of expectations.
As for Ryanair and American Airlines, the setbacks are ultimately rooted in the same cause. Ireland's Ryanair 
downplayed last quarter's huge earnings growth by warning investors that the current swell of demand -- and 
pricing power -- might not persist to and through the end of the year. Likewise, while American Airlines' record-
breaking top line of $14.1 billion was 4.7% better than the year-ago figure, it also offered guidance the market 
interpreted as being subpar .
The question remains, though: Are any (or all) of these sell-offs a mistake, and ultimately a buying opportunity 
rather than a red flag? It depends.
Don't ignore the same, repeated warning
For the record, while you should be looking to buy stocks you want to own while they're down, just because a 
stock's down in a particular calendar month doesn't inherently make it worth owning. Some companies are 
trainwrecks every 12 months of the year. Sometimes more than one month's worth of selling is in the cards. 
Sometimes, such a steep sell-off is a mistake that will be corrected sooner than later. There's always more to the 
story.
This particular month, with these particular stocks, however, there are bigger-picture themes to consider. Of these 
laggards, two different airlines loosely pointed to a looming headwind. And of these same laggards, two different 
solar power  technology stocks are signaling slowing uptake of their products. What you don't see is that solar panel 
maker SunPower recently dialed back its full-year earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( 
EBITDA ) guidance, as "Demand in the second quarter has weakened more than expected in the Southeast and 
Southwest."
That warning certainly underscores Enphase's lackluster expectations.
Oh, and since the end of July, airline JetBlue reduced its full-year profit forecast, citing (among other things) waning 
demand  for domestic travel services. SolarEdge also served up revenue guidance of between $880 million and 
$920 million for the quarter now underway versus analyst estimates of $1.05 billion, sending the stock lower in 
response.
A couple of clear themes are starting to firm up here.
The point is, take these companies' worries at face value. None of them want to upend their stocks. But they're 
doing so anyway, and they're not alone when they are. It's conceivable these wider, bearish narratives could start 
taking on a life of their own -- even if just temporarily -- further fanning the selling flames.
Make a point of taking a step back sometimes
Veteran investors innately know this, of course, even if they don't overtly know they know it.
If you're a new investor feeling a little overwhelmed by the concept, though, don't be. It's not really all that 
complicated of an idea. In fact, it's a fairly simple premise that can make you a much better investor.
That is, most industries' companies (not to mention their stocks) move in a herd. They're all addressing the same 
customers, after all, under the same conditions. They're often using the same technology, know-how, and supply 
chains. If one or two of them are saying the exact same thing, there's probably something to it.
Continue to be company-specific about your picks, looking for unique edges and competitive advantages. Just don't 
forget to take a step back every now and then and assess the bigger picture. There's a lot of value from that 
perspective as well.
Is It Time to Buy the Nasdaq 's 5 Worst-Performing July Stocks?
James Brumley  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends Enphase Energy, 
Nasdaq, and SolarEdge Technologies. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) passed 18 million monthly passengers in July for the first time, as budget airlines 
continue a record-breaking post-pandemic streak.
Some 18.7 million people travelled with the Irish carrier in July, the company reported on Wednesday, up 11% year 
on year and 26% on 2019 - prior to the pandemic.
"We see this robust trading as extremely encouraging," Peel Hunt analysts noted, backing shares in the Irish carrier 
with a price target of (EURO)23.5 - up almost 50% on Tuesday's close.
Ryanair's 102,000 flights during the month came in above expectations, the bank added, with just 800 cancelled in 
light of air traffic control disruption in mainland Europe.
Peer Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) also broke records in July, penning over 6 million monthly passengers for 
the first time, as budget airlines bask in flurrying returning demand after the pandemic grounded flights.
Both airlines recorded load factors upwards of 90%, meanwhile, with Ryanair flights 96% full on average compared 
to Wizz's 94.9%, marking positive news considering each is waiting on orders for new aircraft.
Ahead of Wizz's results on Thursday, Liberum analysts were less optimistic about the stock, which has risen 25% 
so far this year as the company targets profitability.

Travel is recovering, there is little doubt about it.
Ryanair's traffic was more than 10% higher year-on-year in July, Marriott has upped its guidance for the second half 
of the financial year and Whitbread sharesare nearing their highest level since the pandemic.
So, will Intercontinental Hotels Group PLC (LSE:IHG) (IHG), the owner of Holiday Inn and Regent, be able to 
maintain a similar upward trajectory when it reports half-year results on Tuesday, 8 August?
Up nearly 18% in 2023, the hotel group hasbeen consistently given a 'buy' rating this year from analysts such as 
Jefferies, which calls the group a "cash machine" and believes there is little chance of a slowdown in consumer 
markets.
Net unit growth (NUG) is expected to rise by more than 4% year-on-year, revenue per available room (RevPAR) 
should jump by 24% and underlying earnings could reach US$486 million for the first half, Barclays believes.
Marriot shares are up more than 38% in the year-to-date       Source: Shutterstock 
US rival Marriott International (NYSE:MAR) backed its mid-single-digit NUG target when it reported strong results 
on Tuesday.
RevPAR at the Maryland-based firm jumped by 13.5%, while adjusted EBITDA rose to US$1.2 million in the second 
quarter and more than 33,000 new rooms were added,a trading update revealed.
Can IHG join Marriott in celebrating a strong recovery?
If IHG can execute its RevPAR targets for the second quarter, Barclays reckons it could result in full-year estimates 
being nudged slightly higher, although "nothing like the magnitude" of increases experienced by Premier Inn owner 
Whitbread.
Tuesday's update will also be the first time investors hear from newly appointed chief executive officer Elie Maalouf, 
who replaced Keith Barr in July.
Shares in IHG are down more than 1% on Wednesday, having opened at around 5,745p.

(Alliance News) - Budget airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Tuesday said passenger 
traffic improved in July from a year before, with Wizz Air seeing a larger jump in numbers. 
The Dublin-based Ryanair said that it carried 18.7 million passengers in July, up 11% from 16.8 million a year prior. 
The load factor, however, was unchanged at 96%. 
On a rolling 12-month basis, Ryanair said it carried 175.3 million customers, up 23% from 142.0 million the year 
before. The load factor improved to 94% from 87%. 
The Irish airline also noted that it operated over 102,000 flights in July, however over 800 flights were cancelled due 
to third-party strikes. 
Budapest-based rival Wizz Air said it carried 6.0 million passengers in July, representing a 27% increase compared 
to July 2022, at a load factor of 95% up from 89% a year ago. 
On a rolling 12 months basis, Wizz Air carried 55.4 million passengers, reflecting a 45% rise from 38.1 million, at a

During the period, Wizz Air Abu Dhabi also launched its latest route to Erbil, the capital city of the Kurdistan region 
of Iraq, in a move to unlock travel opportunities for both residents and travellers in the United Arab Emirates. 
Additionally, the Hungarian airline said carbon dioxide emissions in the month of July were up 25% to 523,996 
tonnes from 418,290t during the same period a year ago.

August 2nd, 2023 ( The Motley Fool  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The tech market has been in recovery mode this year after an economic downturn caused a sell-off in 2022. Easing 
inflation and advances in technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), have Wall Street particularly bullish. As a 
result, now is an excellent time to consider expanding your tech holdings before it's too late.
Thanks to its ever-developing nature, the tech market can be a lucrative place to invest. The sector is known for its 
wealth of growth stocks that can almost guarantee long-term gains.
So if you're looking for a reliable way to expand your portfolio, here are three top tech stocks to buy in August.
1. Apple
Sharesof Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) gained 310% since 2018, more than many of the biggest names in tech. The 
company attracted millions of customers with its priority on quality and its interconnected ecosystem of products. 
Consumers have proven their preference for Apple's devices time and time again, most recently amid 
macroeconomic headwinds.
According to Counterpoint Research, U.S. smartphone shipments declined 24% year over year in the second 
quarter of 2023.Consequently, companies like Samsung and Motorola experienced stagnating or declining market 
share. But the same period saw Apple outperform its competitors by growing its market share from 52% to 55%.
The iPhone's growing dominance strengthens Apple's long-term outlook since the smartphone has become its best 
tool for attracting consumers to its other products and services. With recent expansions into virtual/augmented 
reality (VR/AR) and AI, the company likely has a lucrative future, making its stock a compelling buy this month.
2. Amazon
Few companies were hit as hard as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) last year. Reductions in consumer spending 
brought steep declines in its e-commerce earnings, with its stock plunging 50% in 2022. However, improving 
inflation and an expansion into AI have regained investor support.
3 Top Tech Stocks to Buy in August
Since Jan. 1, shares have climbed about 58%. The monster rally has come as the company strengthened its 
position in the $137 billion AI market , projected to have a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030.
This year, Amazon added several new AI services to its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), attracting 
thousands of customers.
Companies like Sony and Ryanair signed on to AWS, drawn in by AI tools such as Bedrock, which uses a language 
model similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT to help clients create custom chatbots and image generators. Its other AI tools 
cater to software developers and the healthcare industry.
Moreover, Amazon is diversifying its position in AI by developing its own chips. The company is quickly expanding 
in the industry and has the resources to potentially outperform the competition over the long term, making its stock 
too good to ignore.
3. Advanced Micro Devices
Recent technological advances have made it crucial to add a chipmaker to your list of holdings. High-growth 
industries such as cloud computing, AI, VR/AR, and others will increasingly require powerful chips, with demand 
likely to soar.
As a result, semiconductor companies  like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) are well positioned to 
significantly benefit from the growth of multiple markets.
AMD's stock skyrocketed some 500% in the last five years as its hardware has become integral to many devices 
and online platforms. The company produces custom chips that exclusively power Sony's PlayStation 5 and 
Microsoft 's Xbox Series X|S game consoles. AMD's graphics processing units (GPUs) are used to run data centers 
worldwide, hosting cloud services like Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet 's Google Cloud.
The current boom in AI has bolstered AMD's outlook, with the company heavily investing in the sector. In June, 
AMD unveiled its most powerful GPU to date, meant to compete directly with Nvidia 's offerings. If the new chip can 
match the competition's performance and launch at an attractive price, it could be a massive win for AMD.
With solid positions across tech and a focus on AI, August is a good month to consider AMD shares.

Akasa Air achieved a significant milestone by becoming the inaugural non-Ryanair carrier to operate the Boeing 
737 MAX-8-200, marking a pivotal moment in the airline's growth trajectory. The airline proudly welcomed its 
maiden Boeing 737 MAX-8-200 aircraft, bearing the registration VT-YAV, on August 1, 2023. The aircraft completed 
its journey from Seattle Boeing Field (BFI) to Bengaluru Kempegowda International Airport (BLR), with stopovers at 
Keflavik International Airport (KEF) in Iceland and Larnaca International Airport (LCA) in Cyprus.
Vinay Dube, the visionary founder and CEO of Akasa Air, expressed his excitement over this significant 
development. He emphasized, "The addition of this remarkable aircraft to our fleet signifies a new era of 
international growth for Akasa, instilling a sense of optimism for our future endeavors."
Dube further highlighted the airline's remarkable feat, stating, "Achieving a fleet size of 20 aircraft in just a span of 
12 months is not only a monumental accomplishment for Akasa but also a testament to the potential of our nation 
that we can all take pride in."
With the integration of this new aircraft, Akasa Air solidified its place as the fourth airline worldwide to operate the 
737 MAX-8-200, aside from the three Ryanair Group affiliates - Ryanair, Buzz, and Malta Air. Max Kingsley-Jones, 
a senior consultant at Cirium, initially brought this noteworthy fact to light.
Ch-aviation.com data reveals that a total of 124 Boeing 737 MAX-8-200 units have been successfully delivered to 
the four airlines. In addition, Boeing's future orders boast an impressive backlog of 222 737-MAX-8-200 aircraft, 
reflecting the industry's confidence in this model's potential.
Meanwhile, Akasa Air has a substantial order for 76 737 MAX aircraft, distributed between 23 737 MAX units and 
53 737 MAX-8-200 variants. This order book expanded during the Paris Air Show 2023, demonstrating the airline's 
commitment to modernizing its fleet. With the latest addition of the Boeing 737 MAX-8-200, the airline's operational 
fleet now encompasses 20 advanced aircraft.
During the same occasion, Dube tantalizingly hinted at the airline's forthcoming announcement of another 
significant aircraft order in the triple digits, scheduled to be unveiled before the conclusion of the current calendar 
year. This serves as a testament to Akasa Air's continuous pursuit of growth and innovation within the aviation 
industry.

Heathrow boss: Business travel yet to rebound

THE AVIATION sector should not bank on soaring demand continuing, the boss of Heathrow airport has warned, 
amid concerns in the sector that airlines could struggle post-summer without a sustained recovery in corporate 
travel.
"We all want to make the most of the demand while it's here but we can't bank on it continuing," long-time chief 
John Holland-Kaye told City A.M.
While leisure travel bookings have soared ahead of expectations, business demand has recovered much more 
slowly, which could create issues when the busiest months - traditionally May to October - come to an end.
"What we're seeing at the moment is leisure demand is ahead of where it was in 2019, business demand is behind 
where it was in 2019," Holland-Kaye explained.
"Business was about 34 per cent of our demand in 2019, it's now down. So it is coming back much more slowly, 
which is sort of what we would have expected. The surprise is that leisure demand is defying gravity, and... we all 
think it's only a question of time before that starts to slow down," he said.
Aviation has seen an unprecedented boom over the last few months due to pent-up holiday demand post-
pandemic, despite ongoing cost of living concerns and a difficult macroeconomic backdrop.
Both Easyjet and the British Airways owner IAG reported record profits for their last quarters in July, with IAG 
netting a colossal (EURO)1.25bn (£1.07bn). Ryanair, though slightly more tempered, still flew past pre-pandemic 
levels on the back of strong demand.
Heathrow boss: Business travel yet to rebound
John Grant, senior analyst at aviation analytics firm OAG, said "the great unknown... is corporate recovery, which 
has been much slower than anticipated".
"Airlines [are] noting this issue as a factor in their year-end guidance", Grant said.
Cirium analyst Rob Morris also noted slowing recovery in the sector as high fares in corporate travel drive 
companies to rein in budgets for business trips.

3 Things About Amazon That Smart Investors Know

August 1st, 2023 ( The Motley Fool  — Delivered by  Newstex )
After a challenging 2022 during which macroeconomic headwinds and fears of a potential recession caused steep 
declines in e-commerce stocks, Wall Street has grown bullish about Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) again.
Though still more than 25% below its late 2021 peak, the company's stock has climbed about 57% since Jan. 1, 
primarily thanks to growing prospects in artificial intelligence (AI).
Recent advances in AI have caused a boom in the industry, with the sector projected to expand at a compound 
annual rate of 37% through 2030. Meanwhile, Amazon has made a major push into the market this year, expanding 
its AI offerings on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and venturing into chip development. As a result, now is an 
excellent time to consider the tech giant before its stock soars any higher.
Here are three things about Amazon that smart investors know.
1. It's expanding its generative AI services
Though it appeared to have fallen behind Microsoft last year, Amazon has since ramped up its AI efforts. 
Microsoft's role as the biggest investor in ChatGPT developer OpenAI allowed it to procure exclusive licenses on 
several AI models, giving it an edge in the market. However, the competition appears to have been the push 
Amazon needed.
Amazon has spent the first half of 2023 heavily investing in AI, and added several new services to AWS.
In June, it unveiled Bedrock, a generative AI tool that uses a large language model similar to ChatGPT to help 
customers build chatbots and image generators. To appeal to the healthcare industry , AWS has launched 
HealthScribe, which is capable of recording and analyzing doctor-patient conversations.
Meanwhile, a new service called CodeWhisperer makes software development more efficient by generating 
suggestions for code based on natural language prompts and the already-written code in a project.
3 Things About Amazon That Smart Investors Know
According to a Reuters report, the new services attracted thousands of clients to AWS, including Sony, Ryanair, 
and Sun Life. With its leading market share in cloud computing infrastructure, Amazon could outperform Microsoft 
and other competitors over the long term.
2. It plans to undercut Nvidia
Amazon has also become one of the first cloud infrastructure companies  to expand into the hardware side of the 
industry. CEO Andy Jassy revealed in early July that the company is taking on chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD by 
developing its own AI chips.
Amazon has so far developed two chips: Inferentia and Trainium. Jassy says his company's hardware will have 
"much better price-performance than you'll find anywhere else."
Nvidia currently dominates the AI chip industry with a market share of about 90%. As a result, many tech firms are 
calling on other semiconductor companies to develop their own high-end silicon in hopes that increased competition 
will lower the cost of these chips.
If Amazon's hardware can match Nvidia's power at an attractive price, it could soon have an immensely lucrative 
position in the market. Meanwhile, expanding into hardware is promising as it diversifies Amazon's role in AI, 
strengthening its outlook.
3. It's a solid long-term buy
Amazon's stock is now up by around 50% over the last five years, a significantly smaller overall gain than its market 
peers. For instance, over that period, Apple's stock has soared by 314% and Microsoft's shares are up by 219%. 
However, that's no reason to write off the e-commerce giant.
Last year's economic downturn hurt Amazon's business far more than it did many other tech companies. It 
experienced significant declines in its e-commerce earnings. As a result, Amazon has more work ahead if it's going 
to surpass the all-time high share price of $186 it achieved in July 2021.
However, consistently easing inflation has already brought improvements to its e-commerce segments this year, 
and its AI efforts are likely to pay off substantially over the long term.
Amazon's stock price growth of 784% over the last decade is likely more indicative of its potential, and Wall Street 
seems to agree. Out of the 55 analysts covering Amazon, 50 rated it as a buy or a strong buy, and many are bullish 
on its expanding position in AI.
Alongside a recovering e-commerce business and a stock down 28% from its high, Amazon is a no-brainer for 
those looking for a long-term investment.

August 1st, 2023 ( GuruFocus.com  — Delivered by  Newstex )
During Boeing Co.'s (
BA ,  Financial ) second-quarter earnings call, President and CEO Dave Calhoun and Chief Financial Officer Brian 
West expressed optimism about the company's financial performance and the path to recovery. Despite ongoing 
challenges, both executives highlighted positive developments and outlined their plans for improving earnings. 
Boeing faced a barrage of questions from analysts eager to understand the company's financial performance and 
future outlook. The call, which took place on July 26,saw analysts from various firms seeking clarity on key issues 
affecting the aerospace giant.
Boeing's CEO and CFO optimistic about earnings recovery
West began by discussing the company's total financial performance. He reported that second-quarter revenue 
reached $19.8 billion, marking an 18% year-over-year increase. This growth was primarily driven by higher 
commercial volume, including increased deliveries of the 787 aircraft. However, the core operating margin  
remained at -2%, and the core loss per share  was 82 cents. West attributed these figures to expected abnormal 
costs, period expenses and losses on three fixed price development programs in the defense business.
Despite these challenges, West emphasized the positive aspects of Boeing's financials. He highlighted the 
significant improvement in free cash flow, which reached $2.6 billion, driven by higher commercial deliveries and 
favorable receipt timing. West also mentioned that the strong order activity resulted in over $2 billion of favorable 
advanced payment timing, which was expected to occur in the third quarter.
Progress in commercial airplanes
Moving on to commercial airplanes, West discussed the progress made in the quarter. The business booked 460 
net orders, including significant orders from Air India, Riyadh Air and Ryanair (
RYAAY ,  Financial ). The backlog now stands at over 4,800 airplanes valued at $363 billion. Although the operating 
margin for the segment remained negative at -4.3%, West noted it was a sequential improvement from the first 
quarter. He attributed the negative margin to expected abnormal costs, period expenses and higher research and 
Boeing Is Optimistic, but Analysts Aren't Certain
development  spending. He assured investors that the company was making steady progress in addressing 
operational challenges and would focus on stability as it aimed to increase production on key programs.
Defense and space segment
In the defense and space segment, West acknowledged the operating margin remained at -8.5%, primarily due to 
three fixed-price development programs. However, he expressed confidence in the portfolio's strong demand and 
the company's ability to return to high single-digit margins by 2025-26.
Overall, both Calhoun and West remained optimistic about Boeing's future. They highlighted the strong demand 
across key programs and services, with commercial demand remaining robust and defense demand continuing to 
progress as expected. They acknowledged the supply-constrained environment, but assured investors that the 
company was focused on execution and steadily increasing production.
Analysts seek clarity on Boeing's financial performance and future outlook
Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies kicked off the question and answer session, inquiring about Boeing's commercial 
airplanes operating loss of $383 million in the quarter. She sought to understand the factors that would drive a 
turnaround and when the operating margins would turn positive. She specifically mentioned production rates, 
abnormal cost concessions and pricing as potential drivers. West responded to Kahyaoglu's question, 
acknowledging the negative operating margins but expressing confidence in sequential improvement. He 
highlighted that the third quarter would still see some negativity, but expected positive margins by the end of the 
year or early next year. West attributed this optimism to factors such as rate ramp, the resolution of abnormal costs 
and a favorable pricing environment.
Cai von Rumohr from Cowen followed up on Kahyaoglu's question, expressing concern about Boeing Defense, 
Space & Security programs' underperformance. He questioned the impact of fixed-price contracts and whether any 
contracts would reach their end, allowing for better pricing going forward.  Boeing's CEO acknowledged the 
challenges posed by the fixed-price contracts, but expressed confidence in overcoming them. He assured analysts 
that the products delivered would perform as expected or even better.
Queries on 737 deliveries and 787 program
Myles Walton from Wolfe Research asked about Boeing's expected improvement in 737 deliveries for the second 
half of the year. West confirmed they expect the second half to be better and that they are always striving to 
sequentially improve. However, he did not provide specific details on the factors contributing to the expected 
improvement.
Seth Seifman from JPMorgan focused on the 787 program and asked about potential supply chain issues. Calhoun 
mentioned the supply chain is getting better and more stable, indicating there have been improvements in 
coordination. However, he did not provide specific details on any potential supply chain issues.
Seifman also sought insights into delivery expectations for the following year. West stated that it is not the right time 
to discuss delivery numbers for the next year. He emphasized the importance of sequential improvement and 
expressed confidence in the 787 program, mentioning the team is steadily working toward production rate 
increases.
David Strauss from Barclays raised concerns about slow 787 deliveries in July and rumors of new issues affecting 
the program. Calhoun did not directly address the rumors of new issues. However, he mentioned the 787 program 
is on the right path and that the team is steadily increasing production rates. He expressed confidence in reaching 
the delivery guidance for the year and highlighted the progress being made in the program.
Calhoun concluded the earnings call by reiterating their commitment to meaningful operating performance 
improvement, including deliveries, revenue, margins and cash flow. He emphasized that despite the challenges, 
Boeing is heading in the right direction and expects operational and financial performance to continue accelerating, 
Boeing Is Optimistic, but Analysts Aren't Certain
aligning with the plan laid out in its Investor Day last November. With a target of $10 billion of free cash flow  in 
2025-26, Boeing's leadership expressed confidence in the company's ability to recover and thrive in the coming 
years.
My take
Boeing's second-quarter earnings call provided valuable insights into its financial performance and future outlook. 
Analysts sought answers to pressing questions, and the company's executives provided reassurance, highlighting 
their confidence in overcoming challenges and delivering positive results in the coming months.
The analysts' response was somewhat negative. In the past week, three analysts have lowered their estimates for 
2023, but their estimates for 2024 have remained relatively unchanged. This aligns with my opinion of the call. No 
significant new information was disclosed, either positive or negative, but Boeing needs to increase production and 
become profitable again. When we consider the six analyst downward revisions in the last 30 days, it is clear that 
Boeing is not a value stock and should only be considered by those willing to take on substantial risk in their 
portfolio.

If you're still thinking about how painful the price of your summer flights was, you're not alone. Meanwhile, the 
owner of British Airways, IAG, reported bumper profits late last week.
Its operating profit before exceptional items for the second quarter of the year was more than four times that of last 
year - rising from around (EURO)295m (£250m last year to around (EURO)1.25bn (£1.07bn) this year.
IAG is not alone. Budget airlines easyJet and Ryanair also recently reported record profits.
There are reasons beyond profiteering driving the price of tickets up. Inflation is making everything more expensive. 
The price of oil is still high, and since the pandemic there have been staffing shortages that airlines haven't been 
fully able to resolve.
There are also fewer planes than there should be, because Boeing and Airbus have had to delay their big plans for 
new aircraft because of supply chain problems.
But ultimately, it boils down to the fact that airlines exist in a monopoly-like world. As long as we want to travel, we'll 
pay what they ask us to.

Got $1,000? Buy These Hot Growth Stocks Before They Take Off

July 30th, 2023 ( The Motley Fool  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A marketwide sell-off last year brought down the value of many stocks. Macroeconomic headwinds curbed 
consumer spending and led to dismal quarterly results. However, 2023 appears to be a year of recovery with many 
companies enjoying monster rallies.
Some of the historically most reliable growth stocks are trending up. Two worth considering now are e-commerce 
giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and big box retailer Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST). So, got $1,000? These 
growth stocks are attractive buys and could take off further.
Amazon
Amazon's stock plunged 50% last year as its e-commerce business suffered steep declines in earnings. However, 
the first quarter of 2023 brought its North American segment back to profitability, with improvements to its 
international segment. Meanwhile, Amazon's quickly expanding position in artificial intelligence (AI) has likely set it 
on a growth path.
While companies like Microsoft and Nvidia have taken the spotlight in AI this year, Amazon is no stranger to the 
technology. The company has used AI in its retail  business for years for product recommendations, tracking 
shopping trends, and making shipping logistics more efficient. However, this year has seen the company heavily 
expand its AI offerings to cloud clients through Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Since the start of 2023, AWS has introduced several new generative AI services. For instance, Bedrock was 
unveiled in June and uses a language model similar to ChatGPT to help users create their own chatbots and 
image-generation services. Additionally, HealthScribe is a tool capable of transcribing and analyzing conversations 
between a doctor and a patient.
According to Reuters, AWS' AI services have attracted thousands of customers, including organizations such as 
Sony, Ryanair, and Sun Life. Amazon has made significant progress in the $137 billion industry and could continue 
to outperform the competition over the long term.
Got $1,000? Buy These Hot Growth Stocks Before They Take Off
This, alongside a recovering e-commerce business, makes Amazon's stock too good to pass up -- and Wall Street 
seems to agree. Fifty out of 55 industry analysts have rated it buy/strong buy, with many citing the company's 
potential in AI.
Costco
Costco has a long history of offering investors consistent gains. Its stock has risen 157% in the past five years, 
significantly more than competitors like Walmart and Target. Meanwhile, the company's annual revenue has 
increased by 60% in the same period, with operating income up 74%. Costco has attracted millions of shoppers to 
its unique retail strategy of charging consumers an annual subscription fee for access to wholesale prices.
The company's success has allowed it to expand to 14 countries and 858 locations. However, it continues to have 
massive growth potential over the long term. In six of those countries, Costco operates four or fewer stores, 
suggesting significant expansion opportunities. For instance, the company has opened two locations in France 
since 2017, with better-than-expected sales prompting it to make plans to build 15 more warehouses by 2025.
Costco's expanding international presence makes it one of the most reliable growth stocks , with access to multiple 
markets. The company has felt the weight of economic hurdles over the last few years. However, as the chart below 
shows, its profits have soared far higher since 2020 than those of companies like Walmart and Target.
Data by YCharts
As Costco continues to expand and attract consumers worldwide to its low prices, investing in its stock is worth 
considering before it flies any higher.
John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board 
of directors. Dani Cook  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and 
recommends Amazon.com, Costco Wholesale, Microsoft, Nvidia, Target, and Walmart. The Motley Fool has a

Ryanair Pilots' Strike In Belgium Cancels Almost 100 Flights
Ryanair Pilots' Strike In Belgium Cancels Almost 100 Flights

A strike by Ryanair pilots in Belgium in an ongoing dispute over working conditions has cancelled 96 flights to and 
from Charleroi this weekend, the airport said, in the midst of the busy summer travel season.
The industrial action will affect 17,000 passengers due to leave or land in the southern city, around 28 percent of 
the expected number of travellers, the airport's management told AFP.
Pilots say the low-cost Irish airline is failing to honour a collective convention that sets time off work in exchange for 
salary cuts agreed in 2020 during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, which decimated the industry.
The pilots' union said the company was failing to respect Belgian law and was prospering thanks to "social 
dumping" that creates unfair competition for other airlines that abide by the rules.
Ryanair has previously called on the pilots to negotiate rather than strike and noted it had reached deals on working 
conditions with its Italian, French and Spanish staff.
More than half of Ryanair's traffic at Charleroi is provided by planes operated by non-Belgian staff, according to the 
company.
A total of 120 flights to and from Charleroi were cancelled during the previous strike weekend on July 15 and 16.

A strike by Ryanair pilots in Belgium in an ongoing dispute over working conditions has cancelled 96 flights to and 
from Charleroi this weekend, the airport said, in the midst of the busy summer travel season.
The industrial action will affect 17,000 passengers due to leave or land in the southern city, around 28 percent of 
the expected number of travellers, the airport's management told AFP.
Pilots say the low-cost Irish airline is failing to honour a collective convention that sets time off work in exchange for 
salary cuts agreed in 2020 during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, which decimated the industry.
The pilots' union said the company was failing to respect Belgian law and was prospering thanks to "social 
dumping" that creates unfair competition for other airlines that abide by the rules.
Ryanair has previously called on the pilots to negotiate rather than strike and noted it had reached deals on working 
conditions with its Italian, French and Spanish staff.
More than half of Ryanair's traffic at Charleroi is provided by planes operated by non-Belgian staff, according to the 
company.
A total of 120 flights to and from Charleroi were cancelled during the previous strike weekend on July 15 and 16.

A proposed settlement between Ryanair (FR, Dublin International) and a pension fund in the United States will be 
heard at the Court for the Southern District of New York on October 20 at 1230L (1630Z), the lead counsel in the 
case announced on July 26. Any objections to the settlement must be filed by September 29.
The budget carrier's parent, Ryanair Holdings, and chief executive Michael O'Leary reached a cash settlement of 
USD5 million with the pension fund on June 7 aided by mediation. The Alabama-based City of Birmingham 
Firemen's and Policemen's Supplemental Pension System had led a class action suit against the airline in 2018, 
claiming it and O'Leary had made false and misleading statements to shareholders about employment issues at the 
airline.
The statements - including O'Leary's comment at Ryanair's 2017 annual general meeting that hell would "freeze 
over" before the Dublin-based carrier accepted unions - had been made before Ryanair took the step of recognising 
pilot unions in December 2017 in order to avert a strike. The fund claimed that the statements had artificially inflated 
share prices that plummeted when some Ryanair workers later unionised, causing losses in shareholder value.
Ryanair welcomed the June 7 settlement, saying it was "in the interests of all shareholders."
As the lead counsel in the case, Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announced that a hearing would be held on 
October 20 for the purpose of determining whether the proposed settlement "should be approved as fair, 
reasonable, and adequate to the members" of the class action suit, and whether the release of the claims against 
Ryanair should be authorised. "Any objection to the settlement, the plan of allocation, or the fee and expense 
application must be mailed [to the court, to the lead counsel, or to the defendants' counsel Cleary Gottlieb Steen & 
Hamilton LLP] no later than September 29," the statement said.

Privacy rights group file complaint against Ryanair 's use of facial recognition
Privacy rights group file complaint against Ryanair's use of facial 
recognition

July 28, 2023 Friday 3:25 PM GMT

Section: IRELAND; Automotive, Transport and Logistics
Length: 536 words
Highlight: Privacy rights group NOYB filed a complaint yesterday (July 27) towards Ryanair regarding its use of 
facial recognition technology.
Body
The group's post described Ryanair's use of the technology as "invasive" and stated that there is "no justifiable 
reason" for Ryanair to be using facial recognition as part of its online booking verification.  Ryanair has previously 
justified the use of facial recognition within its online booking system as necessary to "help verify a customer's 
contact details".  NOYB's programme director, Romain Robert, disputed this justification.   "[Ryanair] already have 
your contact details," explains Robert, "... A verification of contact details via biometrics also doesn't make a lot of 
sense: your email address is not printed on your face or your passport."  The ethics of facial recognitionRyanair is 
not the only company to come under scrutiny for using facial recognition technology. Just last year supermarkets 
using it in their CCTV were threatened with legal action by Big Brother Watch. 
Frasers Group, best known for its Sports Direct brand, have also been sent an open letter regarding their use of the 
technology.  But as more and more companies look to adopt this growing technology, GlobalData's senior analyst 
Maya Sherman explains the potential repercussions they could face.  "Once deployed across public services," 
Sherman begins, "facial recognition represents a questionably ethical act, where not all users may be aware that 
their biodata is being captured and monitored."  NOYB also pointed out this ethical loophole in their original 
complaint.  Despite claims from Ryanair that consent is the legal basis for their facial recognition, NOYB believe 
that the company did not provide customers with "comprehensible information about the purpose" of the process.  
Not only does this not allow their customers to give informed consent, but Sherman also affirmed that passengers 
are given the option to opt out.  She says that this rise in facial technology may be explained by an increased 
requirement for faster data analytics, but companies adopting the technology must acknowledge that it still has 
technical errors and is "especially reliant on socio-cultural biases".  Automating racial and gender bias?Whilst 
Sherman agrees that AI driven facial recognition can be used to "enhance operational efficiency" as well as mitigate 
the chance of human error.  Biometrics have been implemented in airports and airline providers to provide security 
and allow passengers to self-board or check in for flights easier. A 2020 GlobalData thematic report into the use of 
Privacy rights group file complaint against Ryanair 's use of facial recognition
AI in travel and tourism noted that British Airways, Delta and JetBlue had all already implemented the technology 
back then.  The bias within facial recognition and AI is only just beginning to be examined, but Sherman fears that 
the introduction of this technology, if it is trained on a predominantly male or white audience, could create an 
"increased risk of discrimination" both within and outside of the travel industry.  The complaint from NOYB reinstate 
that biometric data is "specially protected" by GDPR because it can pose "unacceptably high risks" to people if 
misused.  As facial recognition becomes more ubiquitous, companies must ensure that they are allowing customers 
to provide informed consent and utmost data privacy.

 In the past week, sector heavyweights like Alaska Air Group ALK[1] and Southwest Airlines LUV[2] reported

European carrier, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues 
owing to upbeat passenger volumes. Meanwhile, Hawaiian Holdings' HA[4] loss narrowed in second-quarter 2023, 
also owing to upbeat air travel demand. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Alaska Air Group

and improved 37% year over year. Operating revenues of $2,838 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of

Lufthansa Appeals European Court Ruling on State Aid
Lufthansa Appeals European Court Ruling on State Aid

Lufthansa (LH), headquartered in Frankfurt International, is contesting the annulment of its EUR 6 billion euro 
(approximately USD 6.6 billion) state aid granted by the European Commission in 2020 under Covid-19-related 
state aid rules.
The German airline has lodged an appeal with the European Union Court of Justice against the May 2023 decision 
by the lower EU General Court (case C-457/23 P). The General Court ruled in favor of competitors Ryanair (FR) of 
Dublin International and Condor (DE) of Frankfurt International, who had raised concerns on antitrust grounds. The 
court found that Lufthansa had received the state aid in error and could have raised a portion of the recapitalization 
through the market. It also noted that the aid did not include a mandatory incentive for a swift repayment.
Nevertheless, by November 12, 2021, Lufthansa had already repaid EUR 3.5 billion of the government stabilisation 
funds and canceled the remaining amount. This included EUR 2.5 billion (approximately USD 2.7 billion) from 
Germany's Covid-linked Economic Stabilisation Fund (ESF) and a EUR 1 billion (approximately USD 1.2 billion) 
loan from KfW IPEX-Bank (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau).
A spokeswoman for Lufthansa confirmed the appeal and stated that the company had fully repaid the stabilisation 
measures approved by the European Commission, along with approximately EUR 92 million (approximately USD 
101 million) in interest rates. The "silent participations" of the Economic Stabilisation Fund were repaid in October 
and November 2021. Furthermore, the ESF sold its shares in Deutsche Lufthansa AG, acquired as part of the 
stabilisation, for a total gain of EUR 760 million (approximately USD 841 million). Thus, the stabilisation process 
was completed before the court ruling.
The German government initially provided measures and loans up to EUR 9 billion (approximately USD 9.9 billion), 
of which Lufthansa utilized around EUR 3.8 billion (approximately USD 4.2 billion). This amount includes around 
EUR 306 million (approximately USD 338 million) through which the ESF increased its shareholding in Deutsche 
Lufthansa AG.
To refinance existing liabilities and the state aid, Lufthansa resorted to various debt and equity financing measures 
later in 2020. The company made a "comeback" on the capital markets in November of the same year, issuing a 
convertible bond of EUR 600 million (approximately USD 664 million) and a corporate bond of EUR 1 billion 
(approximately USD 1.2 billion).

The latest Aircraft Market Intelligence Reports (AMIRs) published by IBA underline the strengthening order position 
and positive underlying value trend in the commercial aircraft market.
The quarterly reports from the aviation market intelligence and consultancy company reveal that the Airbus 
A320neo family locked in the majority of the narrowbody orders at the 2023 Paris Air Show in June, with a record 
500 aircraft order from IndiGo. Airlines also placed significant commitments for widebody aircraft at the show, 
including around 50 Airbus A350s and 30 Boeing 787s.
New narrowbodies
IBA's data shows the Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft fleet is now accelerating, with over 1,100 deliveries. Parking and 
storage declined compared to previous quarters against a backdrop of strong demand and continued return-to-
service following the earlier grounding of the type. Lease rates for the aircraft were in the mid-US$300,000 range 
per month in the second quarter, with similar lease rate performance exhibited by the Airbus A320neo.
Elevated new aircraft demand was evidenced by a strong spread of orders at the Paris Air Show, highlighting how 
operators looked to lock in future delivery positions for fleet growth and renewal. The Airbus A320neo family 
attracted the bulk of the narrowbody orders in Paris, which included a record order from IndiGo for 500 aircraft. 
Boeing also won new orders for its MAX family in the second quarter, with lessor Avolon placing an order for 40 737 
MAX 8s at Paris. Additionally, Ryanair firmly committed to 150 Boeing MAX 10s, the largest variant of the MAX 
family, in May, plus options for a further 150.
Market values of the MAX 8 and A320neo continue to converge, a trend expected to continue through the third 
quarter. New examples of both aircraft types are exhibiting values in the US$51.5-53.0 million range during the 
second quarter, with a slight yet narrowing premium for the A320neo. IBA's insights reveal that strong demand, 
escalation in new aircraft pricing and the continued high-interest rate environment will drive further increases in 
values and lease rates of this asset class through the third quarter of 2023.
Used narrowbodies
The positive trend of value recovery continues for the used narrowbody segment as well, with the market value of 
the popular Boeing 737-800 continuing to trend back towards the base value. The popularity of this aircraft, both in 
Aircraft Market Monitor: Strong Order Surge and Value Recovery
passenger markets and the freighter conversion space, has supported this movement, which is forecast to continue 
into the third quarter.
A similar trend has been seen with the competing Airbus A320ceo, and whilst the aircraft was lagging in value 
performance last year, the recovery relative to its peer reported in the first quarter has continued to manifest. The 
used narrowbody market is proving to be an important source of capacity for airlines to fill their Northern 
Hemisphere summer schedules, with deliveries of new aircraft remaining subdued.
Although A320ceo values are recovering, the B737-800 retains a premium, with a 10-year-old example of the 
former residing below US$20 million in the second quarter, compared to the B737-800, which exhibited values in 
the low US$20 million range.
Feedback from the market suggests a notable uptick in lease rates, supported by competition between airlines to 
take delivery of available assets. This can be a leading indicator of value performance, so IBA adopts a positive 
value outlook for this sector of the narrowbody market through 2023.
New widebodies
IBA's data shows that new widebody aircraft, including the Airbus A350, Boeing 787 and Airbus A330neo, are 
benefitting from the recovering long-haul markets post-Covid, and the slow supply of new aircraft from the OEMs. 
To capitalise on this long-term recovery, airlines placed significant commitments for widebody aircraft at the Paris 
Air Show. Customers committed to around 50 Airbus A350s and 30 Boeing 787s, with the B787-9 and A350-1000 
proving to be the most popular variants.
The B787-9 has received the strongest demand throughout the Boeing 787 Dreamliner programme, as the demand 
has shifted materially from the -8 to the -9 throughout. Likewise, the A350-900 has seen the most demand in its 
family, with orders approaching 800, and deliveries rising towards 500.
Recent order activity appears to be concentrated on the larger A350-1000 variant. While it is yet unclear whether 
this will develop into a longer-term trend, a strong operator base, attractive payload range capability and a large 
Boeing 777-300ER fleet of over 800 aircraft in need of longer-term replacement suggest it might. This is particularly 
true as the entry-into-service of the Boeing 777-9 is not due until 2025.
Data from IBA Insight shows the market values of the new widebody class continue to recover through the second 
quarter, with a positive outlook for the remainder of 2023. New Airbus A350-900 aircraft values in Q2 2023 were 
around US$150 million depending on specification, whilst the value of a new A350-1000 approached US$170 
million. The Boeing 787-10 attracted values approaching US$160 million for a new aircraft, whilst the mid-size 787-
9 was valued in the low-US$140 millions.
Used widebodies
The mid-life widebody market also benefited from the continued resurgence in long-haul travel. Whilst IBA has yet 
to see a full recovery in international traffic to pre-pandemic levels, supply chains and labour shortages have shifted 
a focus to retaining existing fleets, reactivating stored aircraft and bringing in previous-generation aircraft to add 
capacity. Although storage and parking levels of the Airbus A330ceo family appear relatively high at over 20% of 
the fleet, there is demand for aircraft in well-maintained condition.
Demand for A330-300 passenger-to-freighter conversions, combined with rebounding passenger demand, has 
improved the outlook for values and lease rates. A 10-year-old A330-300 aircraft in half-life condition attracted a 
market value approaching US$20 million in in the second quarter, and lease rates in the low-US$200,000 per 
month range.
The Boeing 777-300ER is a beneficiary of the recovery in traffic between Europe and Asia and the steady weekly 
growth in long-haul country pairs. Lease placements more than doubled in the second quarter, with flag carriers 
including Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines taking aircraft on lease. Such improved demand, set against a 
Aircraft Market Monitor: Strong Order Surge and Value Recovery
backdrop of continued lease extensions amongst key operators, creates a promising outlook for values and lease 
rates through Q3 2023.
In the second quarter, a five-year-old Boeing 777-300ER was valued at around US$61 million in half-life condition, 
whilst a typical 10-year-old aircraft was in the low- to mid-US$30 million range. As well as this, Boeing 777-300ER 
lease rates were around US$350,000 per month. However, some lease extensions were observed at higher rates.
Freighters
The data in IBA's AMIRs also reveal insights into the freighter market. IBA previously reported that the value 
performance of the Airbus A330-300P2F has continued to show resilience, despite a softening cargo market. A 
backdrop of increasing feedstock pricing and declining supply is contributing to this trend. IBA continues to observe 
aircraft being acquired with conversion in mind, with a 2012 example acquired in the second quarter for conversion 
and operation with DHL.
A330-300 P2F aircraft in the 2007 to 2013 vintage range attracted a Market Value in the mid-US$30 million to mid-
US$40 million range in quarter two.
Despite the dwindling feedstock and strategic move towards the newer A330 conversion products by some of the 
major operators, including DHL and Amazon, conversions of passenger Boeing 767-300ER aircraft to freighters 
continued at IAI Bedek's Tel Aviv conversion facility in the second quarter. Half-life market values in the mid-to high-
US$20 million range could be achieved in quarter two for recently converted aircraft with mid-2000 vintages. Lease 
rates in the second quarter were broadly in the mid-to high-US$200,000 per month range.
In the factory freighter market, the Boeing 777F continues as the only OEM in-production option, and the aircraft is 
enjoying stable values and lease rate performance. New aircraft in quarter two attracted a market value in the high-
US$150 million to low-US$160 million range. Monthly lease rates were between US$1.25 and US$1.35 million, 
depending on credit and lease terms.
Continued strengthening in the passenger B777-300ER market should keep feedstock in tight supply and limit the 
pace of conversion. With the A350F still four years away and the B777-8F longer still, the Boeing 777F should 
continue to enjoy a positive outlook over the coming years.

Ryanair accused of 'invasive' facial recognition use in Spain
Ryanair accused of 'invasive' facial recognition use in Spain
Alliance News UK

(Alliance News) - A prominent digital privacy campaign group on Thursday filed a complaint against Ryanair 
Holdings PLC in Spain, alleging the popular budget carrier was pushing customers to undergo an "invasive facial 
recognition process". 
Austria's noyb (None Of Your Business) said the Irish airline – Europe's largest by passenger numbers – required 
some customers to go though "a mandatory 'verification process' involving invasive facial recognition". 
This applied to bookings through an online travel agent rather than directly on the company's website or app. 
"There is no reasonable justification for Ryanair to implement this system. Instead, it seems like the airline is 
willingly violating their customer's right to data protection in order to obtain an unfair competitive advantage over 
alternative booking channels," the group said in a statement.
Ryanair said in a statement emailed to AFP that it was seeking "to protect customers". 
"Online travel agents scrape Ryanair's inventory and in many cases miss-sell our flights and ancillary services with 
hidden mark-ups and provide incorrect customer contact information/ payment details," the airline said.
The verification process is "to ensure that they (as the passenger) make the necessary security declarations and 
are informed directly of all safety and regulatory protocols required when travelling". 
Noyb said the complaint came from a customer from Spain who booked a Ryanair flight through the Barcelona-
based online travel agency eDreams and then received an email from Ryanair requesting her to complete a 
"verification process".
The case was filed with the Spanish Data Protection Agency.
Ryanair accused of 'invasive' facial recognition use in Spain
Noyb said Ryanair "didn't provide comprehensible information about the purpose of this intrusive process" which 
requires the client's consent under the EU's data protection regulation.
Ryanair said its processes were "fully compliant with all GDPR regulations".
On its website, Ryanair says customers' identity may need to be verified when a booking is made "by a third-party 
travel agent that has no commercial agreement with Ryanair to sell our flights".
It details two ways of doing the verification process online – the "express" version uses facial recognition technology 
by Ryanair partner GetID and costs 0.59 euro cents.
A third option is going directly to an airport check-in desk before the flight, where Ryanair's check-in fee applies.
Vienna-based noyb is handling hundreds of complaints in various jurisdictions on behalf of internet users over data 
protection and rights concerns.
It has won several cases against some of the world's largest multinationals.
Shares in Ryanair were down 0.2% at EUR15.73 each in Dublin on Thursday around midday.

All eyes on IAG: Investors prepare to see if British Airways owner will soar this summer

BRITISH AIRWAYS owner IAG will report its half year results this Friday, amid what is widely touted as the most 
important summer for airlines in years.
Aviation has experienced an extraordinary boom in demand over the last six months as it enters the first truly 
restriction-free, high volume period since before the pandemic.
While holidaymakers have not yet been put off travelling by the cost of living crisis, recent updates from budget 
airlines Ryanair and Easyjet have, despite being largely positive, slightly tempered expectations.
Conroy Gaynor, aviation analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said "there is a growing concern that the yield 
environment for European airlines is losing buoyancy,because pent-up travel demand and household finances may 
be dwindling." Gaynor noted the "tight" airspace and "unfortunate" ATC strikes, but flagged self-inflicted problems 
such as "staff shortages and IT failures" as a potential risk over the summer.
Long-haul specialist IAG faces other concerns as well, with legacy carriers relying heavily on strong transatlantic 
demand and the reopening of Asia, but Gaynor noted "visibility is limited for the winter."
IAG is yet to show any major signs of a struggle. In May, the group enjoyed its first first-quarter profit since prior to 
Covid-19, upping its guidance for the year for operating profit from (EURO)1.8bn to (EURO)2.3bn.

 Digital rights advocacy group noyb on Thursday filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Authority 
against Ryanair Holdings (RYA.IR) on behalf of an individual who booked a flight through the online travel agency 
eDreams.
The complaint concerns a verification process that the complainant received via email, which involves facial 
recognition. The process is required for customers who book through online travel agencies instead of Ryanair's 
website or app.
While Ryanair claimed that the legal basis for the use of facial recognition is consent, noyb said the Irish budget 
airline did not provide clear information about its purpose, which means a user's consent cannot be informed or 
specific.
Shares of Ryanair fell 1% in morning trading.

 As reported by Mint[1], as part of its strategy to rival tech giants Microsoft and Google, E-commerce giant Amazon 
has been conducting tests of its artificial intelligence services on thousands of customers. In addition, Amazon has 
recently unveiled a new AI tool designed for building conversational customer service agents and healthcare 
technology, specifically for generating notes after patient visits. Also, Amazon teamed upwith Meta and Microsoft[2] 
to challenge Google and Apple's map dominance. 
The company is making a significant push into the healthcare industry with the launch of AWS Healthscribe, a 
service aimed at developing apps that can transcribe and analyze conversations between doctors and patients. 
According to a report from Reuters, one major customer, a 3M unit, plans to utilize this technology for clinical 
documentation. 
Amazon's Bedrock service, introduced in April, targets its cloud customers and enables them to create apps using 
various AI models. This move is in response to the investment made by competitors like Microsoft and Google in 
generative AI technology. Microsoft has its AI chatbot, Bing Chat, and it is a major investor in OpenAI, known for its 
viral sensation, ChatGPT. Conversely, Google has its own generative AI-based chatbot called Bard, with plans to 
integrate it into different levels of its services. 
To leverage its status as the leading cloud provider in revenue, Amazon seeks to offer businesses a wider selection 
of AI models compared to its rivals. The company plans to make Amazon Bedrock available to all customers soon, 
although no specific date has been provided. 
Amazon's vice president of databases, machine learning, and analytics mentioned that several companies, 
including Sony, Ryanair, and Sun Life, have already tested the Amazon Bedrock service. Additionally, Amazon is 
working closely with Nvidia to secure key chips and understand their ramp-up schedule amid the fierce competition 
among AI companies.

CFM56 and LEAP aftermarket sales are a boost for Safran
CFM56 and LEAP aftermarket sales are a boost for Safran

 Aftermarket sales of spare parts for CFM LEAP and CFM56 engines have recovered to well over 2019 levels, the 
first time this happened since the pandemic. Sales were up 36.5 percent in HY1. As this trend is expected to 
continue this year,Safran Group[1] has raised its full-year guidance and now expects a €3.1 billion operating profit, 
up from €3.0 billion in the February guidance. CFM56 and LEAP aftermarket sales are a boost for Safran. 
Civil aftermarket revenues are guided to increase by mid to high-twenties in dollars compared to the low twenties in 
the previous guidance, Safran CEO Olivier Andris said on Thursday during the HY1 results earnings call. 
Aftermarket sales were already up 38.1 percent year on year in Q1 and again by 35 percent in Q2. This reflects 
higher part prices since November last year but mostly the recovery of global air travel in the past months. In July, 
worldwide CFM flight cycles increased to 103 percent of 2019 levels. Only Europe, which is affected by the closure 
of Russian airspace, and the Asia Pacific region are behind. 
Increased flight cycles mean that there is more demand for spare parts and MRO work for the new-generation 
LEAP engines, but also for the CFM56. Because of the delivery delays at Airbus[2] and Boeing, older-generation 
A320ceo's and 737NGs continue to fly. Andris pointed to the low retirement level of the CFM56-powered aircraft of 
just 94 in the past six months. 
2.000 shop visits this year 
CFM says it is on track for shop visits of 2.000 CFM56 engines this year. As CFM CEO Gal Mheust explained 
during a pre-Paris Airshow presentation, of the 24.000+ CFM56-5B and -7B engines that are in service, some 
11.000 have yet to do their first shop visit. This gives aftermarket sales plenty of opportunities to grow in the coming 
years. CFM will provide spare parts for the CFM56 until at least 2040. 
Andris confirmed that CFM delivered 785 LEAP engines in HY1, in line with what GE Aerospace[3] said on 
Tuesday. This is up 69 percent versus the same period of last year and up fourteen percent on Q1. CFM is on 
target to deliver 1.700 LEAPs this year. The engine maker has a backlog of some 9.600 engines, thanks to recent 
orders from Ryanair, Avolon, and Jet2. This excludes the 800 engines announced this month as part of the large Air 
India order. 
While its rival Pratt & Whitney is suffering from a range of issues with its Geared Turbofan and has only a limited 
number of spare engines available, Andris is proud that CFM has sufficient spare engines. 'We have a policy of 
CFM56 and LEAP aftermarket sales are a boost for Safran
keeping our customers flying. This is a real difference to our competitor. We keep our airlines flying all the time. 
There is no disruption, never.'As reported today, the Safran CEO confirmed that CFM has been confronted with a 
similar powder metal contamination problem[4] as P&W, but the problem seems to be on a lower scale. 
HY1 results 
Safran Group, which includes Propulsion, Equipment & Defense, and Aircraft Interiors, posted a net profit in HY1 of 
€1.085 billion compared to €551 million in the same period of last year. Consolidated adjusted revenues increased 
to €10.945 billion from €8.560 billion. The recurring operating income was €1.397 billion, up from €1.047 billion. 
Free cash flow was €1.463 billion, thanks to advanced payments for Rafale fighter aircraft. 
Aerospace Propulsion, which includes civil, military, and helicopter engines, contributed €5.677 billion to this result 
and produced a €1.046 billion profit from operations. Equipment & Defense generated €4.1 billion in revenues and 
reported a €459 million operating profit. 
Aircraft Interiors including cabins and seats recorded €1.163 billion in revenues, which is still 41 percent below 2019 
levels. The unit was loss-making at €-100 million and subject to €38 million in impairments. This is attributed to 
lower Business Class seat deliveries, notably to Boeing for the 787. Safran is also waiting for certification of other 
new cabin products, so was confronted with development costs and cost overruns. Aftermarket sales were back at 
2019 levels in June. 
Aircraft Interiors should reach break-even by the end of this year, thanks to further cost optimizations that include 
the transfer of activities from the US to Mexico and from Germany to Tunisia. Safran has a market share of 35 
percent in cabins and seats and sees strong demand for its products, which makes it confident about the future. 
Safran continues to be affected by high inflation and supply chain[5] issues, notably in the production of landing 
gears. On the positive side, the weaker US dollar has a positive effect on sales. During HY1, Safran, Airbus, and 
Tikehau Ace Capital completed the acquisition of Aubert & Duval, a key supplier of metallic parts to the engine and 
aircraft maker. The three shareholders will invest €300 million in the company over the next four years.

Boeing plans to enhance production from 31 to 38 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft per month. The company experienced a 
minor setback in April 2023 when an error from its supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, temporarily delayed an earlier 
production increase. However, Dave Calhoun, Boeing's president, and chief executive officer expressed confidence 
in their recovery and commitment to meet operational and financial goals for both the short and long term.
While the commercial aircraft division shows signs of recovery, Boeing's defense business encountered challenges 
in the same quarter. Notably, three major fixed-price programs, including NASA's Starliner capsule, the United 
States Air Force's T-7 jet trainer, and the US Navy MQ-25 tanker drone, faced issues, leading to a loss of $527 
million. This loss was attributed to setbacks in some fixed-price development programs, labor instability, and supply 
chain disruptions.
Despite these challenges, Boeing remains optimistic about its financial prospects for the year. The company 
reiterated its goal to generate free cash flow ranging from $3 billion to $5 billion in 2023. Additionally, Boeing aims 
to deliver at least 400 737 single-aisle aircraft and 70 787 Dreamliners throughout the year. With demand for their 
products strong, Boeing is steadily increasing production rates and investing in its workforce, products, and 
technologies to meet customer commitments and sustain growth in the future.

Ryanair has received a bullish update from broker Liberum, which has raised current-year forecasts after the first 
quarter numbers.
Constrained supply growth will support the airline's unit revenues, despite macro risks to demand, while 
accelerating cash generation as capex passes its peak points to the potential for payouts to shareholders.
A less favourable fuel cost assumption sees later year forecasts cut, but Liberum adds it remains above consensus.
Buy with an increased price target of (EURO)23 (previously (EURO)20.50) is the broker's revised stance.

July 26th, 2023 ( The Motley Fool  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The stock market looked poised to break a long upward streak on Wednesday morning, as major market index 
futures were slightly lower on the day. With 12 straight days of gains, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
(DJINDICES: ^DJI) is now within 1,400 points of its all-time record high from January 2022, and eclipsing that mark 
could usher in even more optimism about the prospects for investors in the years to come.
Earnings season continued to reach its peak this morning, and another pair of Dow stocks  released their latest 
results. Both Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) saw their share prices rise in premarket trading as 
shareholders celebrated their financial reports. Here's everything you need to know about the two companies and 
whether the news could lead to longer-term gains.
Boeing takes flight on production gains
Shares of Boeing were up more than 3% in premarket trading early Wednesday. The aerospace and defense giant 
reported second-quarter financial results that showed sharp gains in key metrics, and it anticipates stepping up its 
production efforts in order to meet huge levels of backlogged orders.
The headline numbers for Boeing were mixed. Revenue jumped 18% year over year to $19.75 billion, and free cash 
flow came in at $2.6 billion, reversing some of the outflows that the aircraft maker has dealt with in recent years. 
However, Boeing continued to lose money, with adjusted losses coming in at $0.82 per share.
The commercial aircraft segment was a key source of strength for Boeing, with sales climbing 41% from year-ago 
levels. Boeing delivered 136 aircraft during the period, up from 121 in the same period a year ago and with a more 
favorable mix of higher-end 787 Dreamliner aircraft. The company booked 460 net orders, including a 220-unit 
block from Air India, and also received a commitment from Ryanair for up to 300 of its 737 MAX aircraft. By 
contrast, revenue from defense, space, and security was down slightly year over year.
With more than 4,800 orders in its commercial backlog valued at $363 billion, Boeing is stepping up production, with 
the intent to boost 737 volume to 38 per month and 787 volume from four to five per month. The anticipated long-
These 2 Dow Stocks Are Making Bulls Happy
term goal is to have 50 737s and 10 787s coming off production lines each month by 2025 or 2026, and that would 
go a long way toward restoring Boeing's leadership  in the aerospace industry.
Coca-Cola raises its guidance
Meanwhile, shares of Coca-Cola gained a fraction of a percent before the market opened on Wednesday. The 
beverage specialist's second-quarter financials were solid, and the company boosted its outlook for the remainder 
of the year.
Coca-Cola's revenue rose 6% year over year to $11.97 billion. That resulted in net income of $2.55 billion, up 34% 
from year-ago levels. Some one-time items boosted that number, but even after accounting for those, adjusted 
earnings of $0.78 per share climbed 11% from the same period last year.
Pricing power was a key aspect of Coca-Cola's success, as unit case volumes worldwide were flat. Bottom-line 
performance was strongest in the Americas, with Latin America leading the way higher despite some currency-
related negative impacts. The beverage company also pointed to its innovation as a driving force, given changing 
customer preferences that have required Coca-Cola to pivot away from its namesake sugary soft drinks to embrace 
other categories.
Best of all, Coca-Cola now expects to see full-year 2023 organic revenue growth of 8% to 9%, with adjusted 
earnings seeing gains of 5% to 6% even after weighing adverse currency impacts. Coca-Cola continues to be a 
cash cow , and investors particularly appreciate that in the current macroeconomic environment.
Dan Caplinger  has positions in Boeing. The Motley Fool recommends the following options: long January 2024 
$47.50 calls on Coca-Cola. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .

Alaska Airlines: high air fares have reached their peak
Alaska Airlines: high air fares have reached their peak

Jul 26, 2023( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Strong leisure traffic helpedAlaska Airlines[1] to produce a solid Q2 net profit of $240 million, up 74 percent over 
the same period last year. High fares contributed to the result, but the airline is expecting them to drop in the current 
third quarter and coming months, a trend also noticed by Ryanair earlier this week. 
The $240 million net profit compares to $139 million in Q2 last year. Excluding special items and fuel hedge 
accounting adjustments, the profit is $387 million. The pre-tax margin reached 18.3 percent, which must be a 
record-high for the industry, said CEO Ben Minicucci in Tuesday's earnings call. This compares to a $-142 million 
net lossin the first quarter.[2] 
Total revenues were $2.838 billion, up from $2.658 billion in Q2 2022. Of this, passenger revenues were $2.598 
billion (2022: $2.418 billion), $170 million from the Mileage loyalty program and other revenues, and $70 million 
from cargo ($65 million). Departures were down 1.3 percent this quarter, but thanks to more Boeing[3] MAX 9s in 
the fleet, higher gauge and higher utilization exceeded 2019 levels by four percent. Capacity was up 9.9 percent 
year on year. 
Unit revenues were down 2.9 percent compared to 2022, but Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Harrison blamed 
this on a 'noisy' year due to volatile pricing and capacity. Other airlines have stated too that Q2 2022 was 
exceptionally strong, which makes a direct comparison difficult. Compared to Q2 2019, unit revenues were up 23 
percent in the quarter and even 25 percent in June. Premium cabins continued to sell strong and were up twelve 
percent over last year. They contributed 31 percent to all revenues in Q2. 
Surge in international demand hurts Alaska 
Harrison also noted another trend seen by Alaska: an unprecedented surge in international demand. 'We believe 
that pent-up international demand has had the effect of a larger pull from would-be domestic travelers than has 
historically been the case. Long-haul international seats off the West Coast are up 31 percent year over year this 
June.' He added that enough Alaska customers have been redeeming Mileage miles to fly internationally to fill 
eighteen Boeing 787s. 
'While we believe this will eventually normalize, there is a disproportional impact on our domestic fares in the third 
quarter, which we estimate could impact our revenue performance by a half to one percent,' Harrison said. He 
Alaska Airlines: high air fares have reached their peak
noted that Business travel is still down at 75 percent of 2019 levels, blaming it on the weakened technology sector 
in California. The West Coast is the least recovered area anyway. 
Expenses were up to $2.501 billion from $2.471 billion. Thanks to a hedging benefit, the fuel bill was lower this 
quarter to $573 million versus $776 million last year. Noticeably higher were landing fees, catering, and aircraft 
maintenance. The operating result was $337 million, up from $187 million. 
For HY1, Alaska Airlines Group including Horizon Air reported a $98 million net profit, up from a $-4 million loss last 
year. Revenues grew to $5.034 billion from $4.339 billion, of which $4.582 billion came from passenger tickets. 
Cargo revenues were up by $5 million to $128 million. Total expenses increased to $4.883 billion ($4.354 billion), 
with the fuel bill ten percent higher year on year to $1.238 billion. The operating profit for the period was $151 
million ($-15 million). 
The Alaska Group ended June with $2.4 billion in unrestricted cash and marketable securities. Long-term debt 
stood at $1.9 billion. 
Leisure fares are coming off their peaks 
Alaska is still seeing very strong demand and record-high yields. But things are changing, as Minicucci remarked. 
'Leisure fares have recently started to come down from their peaks. Delivering on our targets will not be without 
challenges, but we remain focused on restoring the tendance of our resilient business model, driving improvements 
in efficiency and productivity, and controlling unit costs to deliver strong financial performance.' 
Another trend seen in June is that customers book very close in. They did even more than in 2022 and in 2019. 'If 
this trend persists, this represents an additional 100 bases points of revenue upside to our current third quarter 
guide.'  
The airline expects Q3 revenues to be between zero and three percent up at a ten to thirteen percent higher 
capacity. This will bring unit results by nine percent, as a six-point deceleration on Q2 performance, said Harrison. 
Half of this can be attributed to lower fares, while the other half comes from domestic industry capacity growth, 
stage-length growth, and holiday timing shifts. 
Investors not convinced 
Alaska is confident that it will hit its financial targets this year, counting on a revenue growth of eight to ten percent 
year on year, a one to three percent reduction in costs, a pre-tax margin of nine to twelve percent, and earnings per 
share of $5.50 to $7.50. Full-year capacity should be up eleven to thirteen percent and that for Q3 by ten to thirteen 
percent, thanks to a higher completion rate and more operational resilience, and higher productivity. 
This outlook didn't convince investors on Tuesday. After Alaska released its results, stock prices tumbled down 
from $50.36 to close at $46.45 as investors think that the airline might be adding too much capacity during Q3. 
Minicucci praised Boeing for being able to consistently deliver new aircraft to Alaska Airlines, despite the various 
production issues. The airline took delivery of eight MAX 9s during the quarter, which brought the fleet to 51. It also 
inducted six Embraer[4] E175s for Horizon Air to grow the fleet to 39. As announced before, Alaska will phase out 
the last Airbus[5] A321neo by the end of September to become an all-Boeing operator.

On the back of the buoyant traffic scenario, RYAAY's profit after tax was €663 million in first-quarter fiscal 2024, up 
more than 100% year over year. Total operating costs grew 23% to €2.94 billion, owing to higher fuel (+30% to 
€1.34bn), staff costs and higher air traffic control fees. 
The load factor increased to 95% in the reported quarter from 92% in the year-ago quarter. 
Average fares in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were up 42%. 
Ryanair expects its traffic view for fiscal 2024 to be 183.5 million.

JBHT's total operating revenues of $3,132.6 million also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,347.5 million 
and fell 18.4% year over year. The downfall was due to a decline in revenue per load of 24% in Integrated Capacity 
Solutions, 13% in Intermodal, 21% in Truckload and a 4% decline in productivity in Dedicated Capacity Solutions on 
the back of changes in customer rate, freight mix and lower fuel surcharge revenue. 
Total operating revenues, excluding fuel surcharges, decreased 14% year over year. 
Delta Air Lines DAL[5] reported better-than-expected revenues and EPS, driven by strong air-travel demand. DAL's 
second-quarter 2023 EPS (excluding 16 cents from non-recurring items) of $2.68 comfortably beat the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of $2.42. DAL reported EPS of $1.44 a year ago, dull compared to the current scenario, as air-

bitcoin breaks lower, gold steady, oil firm, grains breaking out.
Ryanair Touts Lower Fares to Fill Planes as Costs Start to Bite
This article from Bloomberg may be of interest. Here is a section:
Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary previously said that ticket prices would remain elevated for the 
next five years because of higher oil prices and environmental charges. Ryanair, which has built its 
Fuller Treacy Comment of the Day - Ryanair Touts Lower Fares to Fill Planes as Costs Start to Bite, and 
more...
business model around ultra-cheap flights, said in May the typical (EURO)9.99 ($11) fare could double in 
price as summer demand skyrockets and because of a supply backlog caused by a shortage of planes.
The proposed fare stimulus comes as Ryanair expands its fleet with plans to take on an additional 173 
aircraft by the end of March. Ryanair, which had 558 aircraft on June 30, announced a deal this year for as 
many as 300 Boeing 737 Max jets worth $40 billion. It comes as the Irish firm targets 30% of the European 
air-travel market by 2034.
Eoin Treacy's view
Will post-pandemic demand return to the pre-pandemic norm? Most estimates suggest the triumph of linear thinking 
is unchallenged. When business is poor, they suggest it will continue lower. When it rebounds, they think higher 
prices are sustainable indefinitely. The truth is a lot more cyclical.

Wheat Climbs After Another Russian Missile Attack on Odesa Port
This article from Bloomberg may be of interest. Here is a section:
The world still has a large buffer of wheat stockpiles, and top shipper Russia continues to export its own 
bumper crop to world markets. About 33 million tons of crops were shipped to global destinations under 
the pact, including about 17 million tons of corn and nine million tons of wheat. The top destination was 
China, followed by Spain, Turkey, Italy and the Netherlands.
Elsewhere, lack of rains and heat are threatening crops in parts of the US and southern Europe, increasing 
risks to food supplies. Still, wheat futures have fallen by almost half from the record reached in March last 
year to $7.10 a bushel. That compares with an average of $5.82 over the past 10 years.
Eoin Treacy's view
We are entering a new phase of the war because both Moscow and Odessa are now targets for missile/drone 
strikes. The efforts to allow Ukraine export grain were aimed at ensuring buyers would have enough to eat. That 
has also been a central point in how well Russia has secured support from regional governments. The obvious 
escalation would be to bomb Russia's export facilities through the Black Sea to both level the playing field and 
increase the urgency of negotiations.

A Bug Exterminator That Trades Like Nvidia
This article from Bloomberg may be of interest to subscribers. Here is a section:
None of this bodes particularly well for humanity, of course, and there are signs that the warming climate 
could increase the demand for pest control even further into new areas. The termite population is getting 
hungrier. The mosquito season is growing longer. And some bugs, including the German cockroaches, are 
losing their sensitivity to existing pesticides. One way or another, Americans - led by those newly 
christened Floridians and Texas that arrived in the past several years - are going to have to learn to live in a 
world full of unpleasant critters, and that's likely to add to the extermination industry's reputation as a 
recession-proof juggernaut.
Eoin Treacy's view
Fuller Treacy Comment of the Day - Ryanair Touts Lower Fares to Fill Planes as Costs Start to Bite, and 
more...
It seems inevitable that the next trend in asset management will be in climate survival funds. Many ESG 
funds were just another way to leverage up on technology bets and displayed high beta to the sector. 
That's not quite as compelling following the roller coaster of the last few years.
Meanwhile, investors are much more concerned these days with governance than environmental metrics. 
The way to get investors on board is to appeal to their desire to boost returns. Expanding markets lead to 
expanding earnings. If the range and prevalence of insects is growing that's an investment opportunity.

Highlight: Irish airline Ryanair has reported an expectedly strong first quarter (Q1) for the 2024 financial year, with 
an 11% bounce-back in passenger numbers compared to the slump in 2023 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Body
Although CEO Micheal O'Leary was bullish in his accompanying statement citing the airline's predicted strongest 
summer yet, he was frank about upcoming challenges.  Ryanair reported (EURO)3.65bn ($4bn) in revenue and 
(EURO)663m ($731m) in profit after tax for Q1, but said the growth figures were so positive due to "a Ukraine-
affected prior year Q1" and significant events in 2023 including the extra UK bank holiday for the Coronation.  In his 
statement, O'Leary took aim at the EU and called for European Commission president Ursula Von der Leyen to 
"protect the single market for air travel and minimise the impact of ATC strikes on EU citizens." O'Leary said it was 
an environmental concern, as flights had to be re-routed (at extra cost and causing extra emissions) during previous 
ATC strikes across Europe. 
O'Leary said: "In May, we submitted a petition to the European Commission, signed by over 1 million of our 
customers, calling on the EU to protect "overflights" during national ATC strikes. We believe this would reduce flight 
delays, cut flight times and unnecessary CO2 emissions."  He said the company has invested in its operational 
resilience "in anticipation of increased ATC disruptions", including doubling the staff numbers at its Dublin and 
Warsaw operation centres.  Looking forward, he pointed to the recent order for 300 Boeing MAX-10 aircraft as a 
sign of the company's serious commitment to sustainability.  The strong quarterly result continues the current trend 
of airline growth.

Higher ticket prices and booming demand helped Ryanair post record profits at the start of the summer, but the 
airline was forced to trim its passenger forecasts because of Boeing delivery delays and warned of an uncertain 
winter ahead.
Ryanair yesterday reported profit after tax of (EURO)663mn for the three months to the end of June, nearly four 
times higher than in the previous year and well above its previous record for the quarter of (EURO)397mn in 2017.
The carrier followed easyJet in delivering record profits, as airlines cash in on strong demand and passengers' 
willingness to pay higher air fares.
Ryanair said its year-on-year comparisons in the quarter were boosted by a strong Easter and an extra bank 
holiday in the UK, as well as a weaker performance in 2022 owing to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Revenues rose 40 per cent to (EURO)3.65bn in the period, more than offsetting a 23 per cent rise in costs, thanks 
to higher fuel and staff bills.
Average air fares rose 42 per cent year on year to (EURO)49, but Ryanair reported a "softening" of fares booked by 
people close to their time of travel in late June and July. It forecast that fare rises would ease to "a low double-digit 
percentage" in the current quarter.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said that the airline had little visibility into travel demand heading into the winter, 
but "consumers may require some fare stimulation ... following months of rising mortgage rates and consumer price 
inflation". Philip Georgiadis

Europe Biotech group Bavarian Nordic tumbled after work on its vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus "screeched 
to a halt over the weekend", said Citi.
The Danish company revealed that its experimental drug for respiratory infections did not meet all its primary goals 
in a late-stage trial - a development called "disappointing" by Jefferies as it removed "hopes for entry into a 
blockbuster market".
Swiss wealth manager Julius Baer rallied off the back of an 18 per cent yearon-year jump in net income to 
SFr532mn ($615mn) for the first half of 2023.
The group expanded assets under management by SFr17bn to SFr441bn during the period, benefiting from the 
woes of rival Credit Suisse.
Medical equipment maker Philips fell sharply despite raising its full-year outlook, with an adjusted earnings margin 
now expected at the "upper end of the high single-digit range", it said.
But the upgraded guidance matched analysts' estimates, said Citi, which viewed the new targets as "conservative" 
given the second-quarter performance.
Ryanair dipped after chief executive Michael O'Leary said the budget airline was "stepping back" its passenger 
forecasts for its financial year.
This was "essentially due to ... Boeing delivery delays", he said. Ray Douglas

RYANAIR boss Michael O'Leary has hit out at the European Commission (EC) over its handling of strike action by 
staff at French air traffic control.
Following Ryanair's first quarter results, O'Leary told analysts on a conference call that the continuing failure of the 
EC to take action to address the air traffic control (ATC) strikes was "inexplicable" but "exactly what you'd expect 
from anything run by European governments and by the EC".
French strikes have already affected 60 days of flying so far this year and hit major airlines across Europe.
"We have long complained about the 60-day French ATC strike and the EC continues to sit on its hands doing 
nothing," O'Leary said.
Ryanair, which claims the dispute has forced it to cancel over 4,000 flights, is calling for the protection of flights 
pass- ing through French airspace.
In an attack typical of the budget airline's chief, O'Leary slammed EC president Ursula Von Der Leyen for "fobbing 
off" his correspondence.
"Nothing is being done for Europe.
The minimum we're calling for is protection of overflights during French ATC strikes and that hasn't been delivered. 
Most of the ATC providers… are short staffed inexplicably, and are incapable of providing the staffing that's 
necessary," he said.
EU slammed by Ryanair boss over ATC strikes
The strikes have caused chaos throughout Europe, with Easyjet cancelling 1,700 flights for the summer, citing 
airspace restrictions due to the ATC feud and war in Ukraine.
O'Leary's comments came after Ryanair announced its first quarter results, which saw its profits for that quarter fly 
past pre-pandemic levels to (EURO)663m (£572m).
The EC was contacted for comment.

 Lufthansa (LHA.F) lodged an appeal at the European Union Court of Justice against a May 10 veto of the 
European Commission's approval for a 6 billion-euro state bailout package granted to the airline during the COVID-
19 pandemic, Bloomberg News reported Monday.
In an emailed statement, the German air carrier noted that the stabilization measures were already fully repaid, 
along with interest worth 92 million euros. The top EU court's website showed that Lufthansa filed the appeal on 
July 20.
The Luxembourg-based General Court's ruling resulted from a challenge initiated by Lufthansa's Irish rival Ryanair 
(RYA.IR), claiming that the state bailout affected fair competition in the aviation sector. In the landmark decision, 
Europe's second-highest court concluded that the recapitalization terms were "too favorable" to Lufthansa.
The Commission, meanwhile, does not intend to join Lufthansa's appeal, confirming earlier media reports. The 
regulator added that it may "evaluate whether to adopt a new decision on the measure, taking into consideration the 
court's judgment."
Lufthansa marginally declined in recent trade.

Ryanair has resisted pressure from holidaymakers and governments to put on emergency flights to Rhodes, where 
wildfires have put the island up in flames.
The budget airline did, however, say it will be running its schedule as normal in a notice released on its website.
Competitors, including EasyJet, Jet2 and TUI have dispatched additional planes to help the thousands of British 
holidaymakers stranded on the island.
In the statement, Ryanair said that: "Passengers departing from Rhodes should be advised that we will accept 
temporary travel documentation issued by the Greek Police."
Jet2 said it has cancelled all flights and holidays to Rhodes for the next week, although empty planes will travel to 
bring people back.
Tui has cancelled all flights to the island until Wednesday, while its customers can return on their initial flight or a 
repatriation flight.
Easyjet, however, has cancelled package holidays until Tuesday, although flights are running as normal, and 
customers can change their travel dates.
British Airways, owned by IAG, said flights to Rhodes and Corfu were running as normal, but customers could 
change their return flight for free, and those not wishing to travel in the next week could postpone.
Ryanair continues flights to Rhodes as normal
Ryanair's decision to run its service as normal comes as the carrier said it is planning to increase its flight prices 
over the next few months after it cut guidance for air traffic during the 2024 financial year.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) is planning to increase flight prices over the next few months after it cut guidance 
for air traffic during the 2024 financial year, a first-quarter update revealed.
Fares in the summer will increase year on year by a low single digit, representing a slightly weaker spike than in the 
first quarter.
Michael O'Leary, the chief executive officer of the airline, claimed the price hike was a result of an increase in the 
headcount and pay of staff as well as a rise in the number of flight routes and several new aircraft delivery delays.
Guidance for traffic during the current financial year was cut from 185mln to 183.5mln, but it still represents a 9% 
increase annually after the Ukraine war negatively affected figures from the previous year.
Despite traffic forecasts falling, Ryanair is experiencing its "largest ever summer schedule" with up to 3,200 flights 
and more than 600,000 passengers expected daily.
An increase in travel to Asia, a rise in Americans visiting Europe and volatile oil prices are all believed to play a role 
in a reduction of short-haul European capacity.
Looking forward, Ryanair said it has little visibility for operations in the third quarter and none for the fourth.
O'Leary said: "Having enjoyed a bumper Christmas and New Year travel period last year (the first festive travel 
season that was not curtailed by the Covid pandemic), we are conscious that consumers may require some fare 
Ryanair hikes prices after aircraft delivery delays dent guidance
stimulation to fill our 25% greater seat capacity this winter following months of rising mortgage rates and consumer 
price inflation."
Ryanair posted profits after tax of (EURO)663mln in the first quarter of 2024, up from (EURO)170mln a year ago 
when the Ukraine war depleted sales.
Profits are expected to come in "modestly ahead" of last year's figures but with little visibility for the second half, an 
exact estimate can only be provided when the airline presents its interim results in November.
Ryanair shares sank over 3.5% in early Monday trading, having opened at almost (EURO)17.

Ryanair 's Q1 FY2024 Results Reveal Slower Bookings in June and July 2023
Ryanair's Q1 FY2024 Results Reveal Slower Bookings in June and July 2023

In their recent Q1 FY2024 results presentation, Ryanair issued a warning about a slowdown in bookings during 
June and July 2023. The airline's Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Neil Sorahan, mentioned that despite a strong 
demand, there was a softening in close-in bookings towards the end of June and early July 2023. He added that 
they will closely monitor the situation in August and September 2023, which will be crucial for their H1 FY2024 
performance, spanning from April 1 to September 30, 2023.
However, Sorahan reassured that, as of now, both bookings and fares are ahead of last year's figures. On the other 
hand, Ryanair's Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Michael O'Leary, acknowledged that the economic slowdown will 
impact the airline's H2 FY2024, given their ambitious growth targets. Ryanair aims to grow by 23% in Europe, with 
plans to add around 30 to 40 million passengers to their pre-COVID volumes.
O'Leary believes that stimulating prices will be essential to maintain their 25% growth in the second half of the year. 
He remains confident that Ryanair's cost advantage will shield them from potential downturns in H2 FY2024, and an 
economic slowdown might even contribute positively to the airline's growth. O'Leary explained that people will 
continue to fly but become more price-sensitive, leading to a shift towards choosing Ryanair across various 
European markets.
Despite this optimistic outlook, Ryanair has revised its FY2024 guidance due to Boeing delivery delays. The airline 
now expects to carry around 183.5 million passengers instead of the previously projected 185 million passengers 
for the year.
Ryanair's recent Q1 FY2024 performance was remarkable, boasting a net profit of (EURO)663 million ($734.1 
million), significantly higher than the (EURO)170 million ($188.2 million) in Q1 FY2023. The surge was attributed to 
robust flight demand during the Easter period, an extra holiday in the UK due to the coronation, and improved 
performance compared to the weak Q1 FY2023, which was affected by Russia's unlawful invasion of Ukraine.
During the three-month period, Ryanair carried 50.4 million passengers and earned (EURO)3.65 billion ($4 billion) 
in revenue with an average load factor of 95%. Their fleet included 558 aircraft, featuring 119 Boeing 737 MAX-
8200 "Gamechangers." Furthermore, in May 2023, Ryanair placed an order for 150 Boeing 737 MAX-10 aircraft 
with an option for an additional 150. Shareholder approval during the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in fall 2023 
will finalize the deal, with deliveries expected between 2027 and 2033.
Ryanair 's Q1 FY2024 Results Reveal Slower Bookings in June and July 2023
However, Ryanair anticipates an increase in exfuel unit costs this year, approximately (EURO)2, due to crew pay 
restoration, higher crew ratios, increased ATC and route charges, and the impact of Gamechanger delivery delays. 
Despite the challenges, Ryanair remains optimistic about its position in the market and the potential for continued 
growth in the face of the economic slowdown.

Ryanair has released its Q1 financial results, reporting Q1 profits of (EURO)663m compared to Q1 2022 profits of 
(EURO)170m. In the report, the airline attributes the increase in profit to a strong Easter, the Coronation providing 
an extra UK public holiday in May 2023 and weak PY comps. due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
The report also announced the launch of Ryanair's 2023 Sustainability Report, 'Aviation with Purpose', 
complementing the airline's recent $40bn order of 300 Boeing MAX-10 aircraft, its adjusted XO2 per pax/km target 
to 50g by 2031, as well as its 1.5 degree Climate Transition Plan.
Additionally, the report introduced Ryanair's intent to create over 10,000 jobs for highly trained aviation 
professionals by FY34, with the growth facilitated by the purchase of 12 new CAE simulators, as well as the delivery 
of 90 more Gamechangers and 300 MAX-10s, with the total fleet expected to reach 124 aircraft by the end of July.

Ryanair stock price 
A word of warning for investors holding shares in Ryanair (NASDAQ: RYAAY) , with high potential upside, comes 
high potential volatility. Shares of the European airline are down by as much as 9.6% during the pre-market hours 
of Monday morning, an initial sign of disapproval from markets.  
As the company releases its first quarter 2024 earnings results, some participants may be finding enough reason to 
sell the stock despite what seems to be more than reasonable growth across the board. Today's decline is, 
however, only a shadow of the massive rally investors enjoyed in 2023.  
As investors get in the weeds (simplified here) of earnings, it will become evident that the unjustified dip in the stock 
price only presents a value opportunity. When the picture is zoomed out from today's events, Ryanair is within the 
top five preferred airline stocks. Winning Industry, Industry Winner 
During the past twelve months, virtually every airline stock has delivered a decent chunk of returns to investors, 
considering that the U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSEARCA: JETS)  has outperformed the broader S&P 500 by as 
much as 11% during the period. Showing the first signs of sector favoritism for investors to begin further diligence 
for a winning investment.  
Ryanair has further outperformed the market by a staggering 35.3% during the same twelve months, taking the 
spotlight as a clear winner. Will the stock have enough fuel left in the tank to make it another twelve months? 
Considering broader market perceptions relative to competitors can help investors understand where the smart 
money is betting. 
Companies like Delta Airlines (NYSE: DAL)  and Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV)  are the other two at play here, 
showcasing symptoms of favoritism by broader investor bases. Delta and Ryanair have taken the bulk of returns on 
a price-action basis. At the same time, Southwest has fallen behind significantly, so the focus will remain on the two 
international players. 
Ryanair analyst ratings  point to a 19% upside from today's prices, a ceiling not yet reflective of the near 10% dip. 
Meanwhile, Delta analyst ratings  only see a 17% potential target from today. The tiny - though precious - difference 
between these two targets can only be attributed to the financials driving Ryanair today. 
Is Ryanair Overbought? Earnings Say Not Likely
Regarding financials, especially future expectations, investors should note that the room for growth lies in Ryanair 
rather than Delta. Considering a forward price-to-earnings ratio rather than the traditional P/E can help investors 
gauge where the perceived 'growth' lies. Fasten your Seatbelts 
Ryanair stock trades at a 10.2x forward P/E, above Delta's 6.4x. Before the value investing crowd begins to 
withdraw, thinking that this only makes Ryanair the more 'expensive' choice, check this out. Markets are willing to 
pay more of a premium for each dollar of future earnings in Ryanair instead of Delta; shouldn't that say it all? 
Being forward-looking, markets may be seeing today's earnings trends as a continuation of a more extensive 
expansion in the underlying financials, therefore bringing the comfort of 'overpaying' for the stock. Double-digit 
growth rates are the catch of the day. 
As Ryanair's press release  will show, revenue grew by as much as 40% during the past twelve months, a massive 
feat considering the average growth rates in the sector. Moving down the headlines, earnings per share more than 
doubled from 16.53 Euros a year ago to 58.22 Euros today, delivering a 252% annual advance. 
Oddly, the main stock price driver, EPS, was up by such a staggering percentage, while the stock did not even 
double during the year. Perhaps these analyst targets are falling on the conservative side of the spectrum other 
critical drivers in the business point to a new potential all-time high price in the works. 
The earnings presentation  says it all. Ryanair grew market share in virtually every country they operate within, and 
management also pointed to further fleet expansion and 'modest growth' in volumes and fares coming for the year's 
second half. Management is looking to increase the total fleet from 537 total aircraft in 2023 to a total of 652 by 
2027, aspiring for a 21% increase in capacity. 
Ryanair stock is reaching a substantial resistance range of $115 to $125 per share; however, these ceilings are 
being challenged by an even stronger uptrend channel. A rise that started in the second half of 2022 has kept the 
stock's momentum alive and heating by the week, creating a tight channel accompanied by rising momentum 
indicators.

Ryanair gets off to a flying start as quarterly profit surges
Ryanair gets off to a flying start as quarterly profit surges

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said that quarterly revenue and profit soared, thanks to a 
strong Easter, as well as an extra bank holiday weekend.
The Dublin-based budget airline reported that revenue increased by 40% to EUR3.65 billion in the quarter ended 
June 30, from EUR2.60 billion.
Pretax profit in the company's first quarter of its financial year surged to EUR740.7 million from EUR203.0 million.
Ryanair explained that the improved results were thanks to a strong Easter, the extra UK Coronation public holiday 
and May and weak prior year comparisons due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which damaged 
last year's traffic and fares.
The number of customers increased annually by 11% to 50.4 million from 45.5 million. Load factor improved to 95% 
from 92%. 
Looking ahead, Ryanair said it expects financial 2024 traffic to be up 9% annually to 183.5 million, which is lowed 
that the 185 million originally anticipated. It explained that this is due to Boeing delivery delays in spring and in 
autumn.
It noted that whilst bookings in the second quarter have been "strong", the fare increase will be much lower than in 
the first quarter due to much stronger pricing last year when summer travel "snapped back" following the Ukraine 
invasion. 
It currently expects second quarter fares will be higher year-on-year but by a low double-digit percentage.

Highlight: After last week’s inflation relief rally, the FTSE 100 takes a breather ahead of interest decisions by the 
US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank.
Body
The FTSE 100 edged just six points higher to 7,669 at the start of a busy week that will see interest rate decisions 
from the US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of Japan. 
With a slew of companies also set to report (Lloyds bank’s half-year results are due on Wednesday, for instance), 
investors stood back to assess where further gains could come from after last week’s inflation relief rally lifted the 
blue-chip index by 3.5%. 
With the Fed likely to return with a quarter percentage point interest rate rise to 5.5% on Wednesday, after pausing 
last month, and the ECB likely to raise its main rate by the same amount to 4.25%, the stage could be set for 
another hike from the Bank of England next week, despite last week’s surprisingly large drop in UK inflation. 
Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘The debate around how much the economy 
needs to be zapped with higher rates to quash inflation properly is still raging on. 
‘While the expectation is that interest rates will need to go higher still, that’s led to some stagnation in the US 
markets as we kick off the week, following strong gains last week.’ 
She said ‘key tech earnings’ on Wall Street will paint a picture of the strength of the US while in the UK, markets 
were gearing up for results from banks and housebuilders that ‘should be able to highlight the lay of the land in an 
economic sense – especially around consumer resilience’. 
The FTSE’s modest gain came as European markets fell in response to a drop in EU business activity this 
month. HCOB’s flash Composite Purchasing Managers’ index (PMI) for the eurozone dropped to an eight-month 
low of 48.9 in July from June’s 49.9. 
Spain’s Ibex 35 index slid 0.7% to 9,507 after the country’s inconclusive general election provided no clear overall 
winner. 
In London, British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines (IAG) was the biggest FTSE faller, down 
2.7%, or 4p, to 151p after the travel sector was hit by a warning from Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary 
Ocado and Vodafone rally as FTSE treads water
around downbeat bookings forecasts for the second half of the year and the impact that higher inflation and interest 
rates were having on consumer spending. 
Prudential (PRU) fell 2.2%, or 23p, to £10.20 after Citigroup analysts cut their target price on the Asia-focused 
insurer. 
Advertising giant WPP (WPP) fell 2.1%, or 18p, to 810p after rival S4 Capital (SFOR) tumbled more than 17% to 
113.6p after a profits warning. 
Ocado (OCDO) jumped 9.4%, or 64p, to 751p after the grocery delivery platform settled its patent lawsuit with 
Norwegian rival AutoStore, which paid the UK company £200m. 
Vodafone (VOD) rose 4.7% after the mobile giant reported an improvement in first-quarter revenue growth and 
hired former SAP CFO Luka Mucic as its new chief financial officer. 
The ‘mid-cap’ FTSE 250 outperformed the FTSE 100, gathering 0.3%, or 52 points, to 19,253, with Essentra 
(ESNT) leading the way. The components maker was up 3.7%, or 6p, at 168p. 
Investment companies were prominent gainers outside the top tier, with Greencoat UK Wind (UKW ) adding 1.8% 
to 148p after investing £444m with other Schroders Greencoat funds to buy a 25% stake in the London Array wind 
farm off the Kent coast. 
Private equity funds also performed well as investors looked ahead positively to their forthcoming half-year results. 
Tech-focused venture capitaist Molten Ventures (GROW ) added 2.6% to 276p and NB Private Equity (NBPE ) 
gained 1.9% to reach £15.80.

Analysts reaming "bullish", holding its Buy rating and setting a target price of (EURO)16.4.
"Ryanair gave no full-year profit guidance range, but management sees net profit modestly higher year-on-year. 
Consensus is considerably more bullish than this," the broker said.
Liberum also noted that Ryanair continues to trade at a premium compared to its European peers, although the 
broker believes this is justified by its market-leading position, track record of profitable growth, superior unit costs 
and strong balance sheet.

Some UK airlines are continuing to sell flights to Rhodes, even as travel companies struggle to repatriate thousands 
of evacuated tourists while flames ravage the Greek island.

SEE MORE Is Britain prepared for more wildfires?
One woman told The Telegraph  that she had 'repeatedly asked' if her family needed to evacuate, but was told to 
stay where she was on Rhodes. As the fire approached, 'the Jet2 rep and the staff just ran out of the hotel and left 
us there', she said. Running from the flames with her 11-year-old daughter, she thought that they were 'not going to 
make it'.
Holidaymakers complained of being 'abandoned by travel reps', said LBC , 'with nowhere to go and without 
transportation', or sleeping in schools or on airport floors with no food and water. Some operators 'failed to contact 
British families who were left walking up to 12 hours in heat of almost 40C on Rhodes', the site said.
'That is a deplorable state of affairs,' Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell told LBC's programme 'Nick Ferrari at 
Breakfast'. 'We will be investigating all of that.' However,'virtually all' holiday companies have 'sprung into action in 
the proper way', he said.
Jet2, the UK's biggest tour operator, and holiday firm Tui both said on Sunday that they were cancelling all flights 
and holidays to Rhodes and offering refunds. Both are sending empty planes from the UK to pick up British 
holidaymakers, thought to be about 10,000 people.

hotels. Ryanair said it wasoperating as normal in relation to Rhodes.
Only about 10% of Rhodes is affected by the wildfires, said Mitchell, and Rhodes airport is not in any immediate 
danger, so airlines are 'entitled to operate a 'business as usual policy'', Calder said, 'but most are expected to 
provide some options to customers'.

Key Points
Ryanair stock is trading lower by nearly 10% during Monday's pre-market session, a fatal reaction that comes after 
the company's release of its first quarter 2024 earnings results. 
Price action relative to the S&P 500 would beg to differ from short-term adverse reactions, suggesting that some 
sector (and company) favoritism is concentrated in the space. 
Ryanair is the winning stock within this industry; as these valuation metrics will show, analysts are also placing the 
stock front and center. 
Management quickly leaves behind a massive advance in financials shown in quarterly figures. It focuses on further 
growth drivers ahead, justifying momentum towards a new all-time high price.
5 stocks we like better than Southwest Airlines
A word of warning for investors holding shares in  Ryanair NASDAQ: RYAAY , with high potential upside, comes 
high potential volatility. Shares of the European airline are down by as much as 9.6% during the pre-market hours 
of Monday morning, an initial sign of disapproval from markets. 
As the company releases its first quarter 2024 earnings results, some participants may be finding enough reason to 
sell the stock despite what seems to be more than reasonable growth across the board. Today's decline is, 
however, only a shadow of the massive rally investors enjoyed in 2023. 
As investors get in the weeds (simplified here) of earnings, it will become evident that the unjustified dip in the stock 
price only presents a value opportunity. When the picture is zoomed out from today's events, Ryanair is within the 
top five preferred airline stocks.
Winning Industry, Industry Winner 
Is Ryanair Overbought? Earnings Say Not Likely
During the past twelve months, virtually every airline stock has delivered a decent chunk of returns to investors, 
considering that the  U.S. Global Jets ETF NYSEARCA: JETS  has outperformed the broader S&P 500 by as much 
as 11% during the period. Showing the first signs of sector favoritism for investors to begin further diligence for a 
winning investment. 
Ryanair has further outperformed the market by a staggering 35.3% during the same twelve months, taking the 
spotlight as a clear winner. Will the stock have enough fuel left in the tank to make it another twelve months? 
Considering broader market perceptions relative to competitors can help investors understand where the smart 
money is betting.
Companies like  Delta Airlines NYSE: DAL  and  Southwest Airlines NYSE: LUV  are the other two at play here, 
showcasing symptoms of favoritism by broader investor bases. Delta and Ryanair have taken the bulk of returns on 
a price-action basis. At the same time, Southwest has fallen behind significantly, so the focus will remain on the two 
international players.
Ryanair  analyst ratings  point to a 19% upside from today's prices, a ceiling not yet reflective of the near 10% dip. 
Meanwhile, Delta  analyst ratings  only see a 17% potential target from today. The tiny - though precious - 
difference between these two targets can only be attributed to the financials driving Ryanair today.
Regarding financials, especially future expectations, investors should note that the room for growth lies in Ryanair 
rather than Delta. Considering a forward price-to-earnings ratio rather than the traditional P/E can help investors 
gauge where the perceived 'growth' lies.
Fasten your Seatbelts 
Ryanair stock trades at a 10.2x forward P/E, above Delta's 6.4x. Before the value investing crowd begins to 
withdraw, thinking that this only makes Ryanair the more 'expensive' choice, check this out. Markets are willing to 
pay more of a premium for each dollar of future earnings in Ryanair instead of Delta; shouldn't that say it all?
Being forward-looking, markets may be seeing today's earnings trends as a continuation of a more extensive 
expansion in the underlying financials, therefore bringing the comfort of 'overpaying' for the stock. Double-digit 
growth rates are the catch of the day.
As Ryanair's  press release  will show, revenue grew by as much as 40% during the past twelve months, a massive 
feat considering the average growth rates in the sector. Moving down the headlines, earnings per share more than 
doubled from 16.53 Euros a year ago to 58.22 Euros today, delivering a 252% annual advance.
Oddly, the main stock price driver, EPS, was up by such a staggering percentage, while the stock did not even 
double during the year. Perhaps these analyst targets are falling on the conservative side of the spectrum—other 
critical drivers in the business point to a new potential all-time high price in the works.
The earnings  presentation  says it all. Ryanair grew market share in virtually every country they operate within, and 
management also pointed to further fleet expansion and 'modest growth' in volumes and fares coming for the year's 
second half. Management is looking to increase the total fleet from 537 total aircraft in 2023 to a total of 652 by 
2027, aspiring for a 21% increase in capacity.
Ryanair stock is reaching a substantial resistance range of $115 to $125 per share; however, these ceilings are 
being challenged by an even stronger uptrend channel. A rise that started in the second half of 2022 has kept the 
stock's momentum alive and heating by the week, creating a tight channel accompanied by rising momentum 
indicators.
Before you consider Southwest Airlines, you'll want to hear this.
MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they 
recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks  that top analysts are quietly 
Is Ryanair Overbought? Earnings Say Not Likely
whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Southwest Airlines wasn't on the 
list.
While Southwest Airlines currently has a "Hold" rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks 
are better buys.

 Hundreds of families have headed off to the sun as Teesside International Airport enjoyed its busiest day since 
returning to public ownership. 
Around 2,000 passengers packed the airport on Saturday to board sold-out flights to destinations including Faro in 
Portugal, Spain's Alicante and Palma in Majorca. The first Saturday of the school holidays, known as the Summer 
Getaway, is always one of the busiest in the summer vacation calendar and Teesside is no exception. 
Holidaymakers were at the busy airport terminal early as flights to Amsterdam and Corfu were the first to take to the 
skies. The airport is now on course to record its highest annual passenger numbers since 2011. It is likely to beat 
the 173,000 traveller total in 2022, with numbers currently up by around 20 per cent year-on-year. 
Teesside Airport returned to public ownership in 2019 and has expanded its list of destinations, with airport bosses 
now looking to add further routes. The expansion follows 3m of investment in the terminal building which has seen 
the return of Duty Free and the opening of the Bannatyne Airport Spa. 
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen commented: 'When we took the airport back into public ownership we faced a 
huge task in turning around its fortunes. Since then, we have steadily grown and are now on course for our best 
year yet by delivering the flights and destinations the people of Teesside, Hartlepool and Darlington want. 
'We have much more yet to do however and are working hard to further grow passenger numbers and bring in new 
businesses in our drive to return the airport to profitability as part of our business plan.' 
Teesside, named the UK's second most punctual airport in 2022, has now grown to enjoy its largest selection of 
airlines, schedules and destinations since being brought back into public ownership. Passengers jetted off to 
holiday hotspots with airline Ryanair, which runs year-round flights to Alicante, alongside Faro in Portugal, Majorca 
and Corfu. 
TUI, one of the UK's biggest holiday companies, has also expanded its offering from Teesside this year, with twice-
weekly flights to Majorca thanks to the popularity of the route last year. It is also offering a service to Antalya, 
Turkey, ahead of introducing flights to the country's popular Dalaman destination in 2024. 
Balkan Holidays is also operating its service to Bourgas, Bulgaria, and holidaymakers are going further afield easier 
than ever with KLM's three-times daily service to Amsterdam Schiphol, serving 200 onward global destinations.

Work has also recently started on the new Business Park South on the airport's southside, which is set to create 
4,400 jobs when fully operational. This week also saw the airport's 2.5m cargo handling facility enjoy its best week 
for business since it was officially launched just under a year ago.

Aircraft delays cost Ryanair 1.5 million passengers in FY24

 Ryanair[1] expects that aircraft delivery delays will affect the number of passengers carried for the full financial year 
2024 by 1.5 million compared to the original target. The airline counts on carrying 183.5 million passengers in FY24 
now compared to the previously planned 185 million, it said on July 24 in its Q1 FY24 release. The shortfall is 
slightly higher compared to what Ryanairsaid in May[2] when it anticipated it to be one million passengers. Aircraft 
delays cost Ryanair 1.5 million passengers in FY24. 
Delivery delays caused by the tailfin fitting issues on the Boeing MAX already affected the planned capacity in the 
airline's first quarter, which runs from May to June. This coincided with Boeing needing extra time for inspections 
and repairs of the aircraft that were either in production or awaiting delivery. 
Boeing is three months late on deliveries to Ryanair. The airline took delivery of 21 MAX 8200s in its Q1, bringing 
the fleet to 119 aircraft by the end of June. In July, five 'Gamechangers' were supposed to be delivered to grow the 
fleet to 124. Until the closing of FY24 in March 2024, the carrier counts on 51 deliveries to bring the fleet to 173 
aircraft. However, it has indications that two deliveries will slip from April to May or June 2024 and affect capacity 
for the 2024 summer period, which is Ryanair's Q1/Q2 FY25. 
Adding to the well-known supply chain issues that affect Boeing and the tailfin issues, another issue could hurt 
deliveries of 86 deliveries that are scheduled for summer 2024 and summer 2025. The collapse of a railway bridge 
over the Yellowstone River (Montana) has severed a lifeline of Boeing's 737/MAX fuselage supplies going into 
Renton, forcing the airframer to use trucks to carry them by road and then load them on train cars again. Ryanair 
said it is unable to quantify the effect this will have on deliveries in HY2 of FY24. 
With the first of150 MAX 10s[3] (plus 150 options) that were ordered in May not coming until 2027, these aircraft 
deliveries are unaffected by the current issues. Including MAX 8200 and MAX 10 deposits, Ryanair expects capital 
expenditures of €2.8 billion in FY24 and €1.3 billion in FY25.

Strong Q1 profit 
Ryanair reported a strong Q1 net profit of €662.9 million compared to €170 million in April-June 2022. Michael 
O'Leary attributed the result to Easter and a second bank holiday in May for the coronation of King Charles falling 
into its Q1. He noted that last year's Q1 had been very weak and heavily distorted by the effects of the war in 
Aircraft delays cost Ryanair 1.5 million passengers in FY24
Ukraine. The parent airline and subsidiaries Buzz, Malta Air, and Lauda carried 50.4 million passengers versus 45.5 
million last year. The load factor increased by three percentage points to 95 percent. 
Total revenues were €3.649 billion, up from €2.601 billion. Ticket revenues grew to €2.474 billion from €1.576 billion 
and ancillary revenues to €1.176 billion from €1.025 billion. Per passenger, revenues were up by 27 percent thanks 
to fares that were up 42 percent to €49. 
Operating expenses increased by 23 percent to €2.938 billion, primarily due to 30 percent higher fuel costs at 
€1.338 billion. Staffing costs were up 31 percent to €360 million, reflecting the restoration of pay cuts, pay 
increases, and higher crewing ratios as Ryanair invested in more operational resilience. It doubled operations 
centers in Dublin and Warsaw. Excluding fuel, unit costs ended at €31, which according to Ryanair is well ahead of 
its next competitor Wizz Air at €47. 
The operating profit was €711.2 million, up from €219.6 million in Q1 last year. Ryanair ended June with €980 
million in net cash and €4.8 billion in gross cash. In August, the carrier will repay a second €750 million bond, using 
internal cash resources. Debt will be fully repaid over the next three years.  
Operations were significantly affected by French ATC strikes, which add up to sixty days since January. O'Leary 
once again called on the European Commission to act and protect overflying flights of France during strikes instead 
of forcing airlines to cancel or reroute flights. A petition that was signed by 1.1 million customers was presented to 
the EC in May, but nothing seems to have happened since then to improve the situation. 
Q2 bookings are good but a little softer 
In its outlook, Ryanair expects Q2 traffic to be up by another eleven percent, but O'Leary warned that fares will be 
notably weaker compared to the very strong same quarter of last year. 'Because of price stimulation, we had a very 
strong snap-up in Q2 last year. Because we had a very strong Q2, our performance this Q2 will not be as strong as 
it was in Q1. We expect fares to be above the prior year but at a low double-digit figure.'  
Q2 bookings have been strong but are a little bit softer in the past weeks, so the outcome of HY1 will depend on 
bookings in August and September. Ryanair and its subsidiaries will carry 3.200 flights and almost 600.000 
passengers every day this summer, its largest-ever summer schedule. It opened three new bases in Tenerife, 
Lanzarote, and Belfast and added 190 new routes. This brings summer capacity to 125 percent of 2019 levels. 
Continued high inflation might affect bookings in HY2 and may require more price stimulation through lowering 
fares. Together with higher fuel costs, this gives Ryanair almost no visibility for the second half of the year, although 
O'Leary is cautiously optimistic that profit after tax will be around the €1.4 billion level of FY23. The airline has 
hedged fuel costs for FY24 at 83 percent and at 27 percent for FY25.

Ryanair's $3 Billion Investment Plan for Ukraine Post-War with Russia

In a significant move, Ryanair has announced its commitment to invest $3 billion in Ukraine once the conflict with 
Russia comes to an end. The low-cost carrier's CEO, Michael O'Leary, personally delivered the news during his 
visit to Kyiv on July 20, 2023.
During his visit, O'Leary met with key officials, including Oleksandr Kubrakov, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister for 
the Restoration of Ukraine and Minister for Infrastructure, as well as Oleksiy Dubrevskyy, the CEO of Kyiv Borispil 
International Airport (KBP).
Ryanair's delegation, consisting of senior management, had the opportunity to assess KBP's terminals and 
infrastructure. They were impressed with the airport's excellent state and operational readiness to resume flights 
once deemed safe to do so.
The airline aims to become a vital partner in the reconstruction and revitalization of Ukraine's aviation industry. 
O'Leary praised the professionalism of the Boryspil airport team, stating that it is fully prepared for a swift 
resumption of flights.
Ryanair has ambitious plans in place, with preparations to launch 600 weekly flights to and from Ukraine within 
eight weeks of the country's airspace reopening. This includes international flights to more than 20 European Union 
capitals and domestic flights connecting Kyiv, Lviv, and Odesa.
The airline plans to offer over five million seats to and from Ukraine, with an ultimate goal of increasing capacity to 
over 10 million seats within five years. To achieve this, Ryanair intends to deploy up to 30 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, 
worth over $3 billion in list prices (which are typically unrepresentative of actual aircraft prices), in the three 
Ukrainian cities.
O'Leary pointed out that before Russia's unlawful invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ryanair was the country's 
second-largest airline. He emphasized that low-cost air travel is vital for the swift restoration of the Ukrainian 
economy.
Kubrakov stressed the importance of maintaining airport operations and the skills of industry employees, revealing 
that Ukraine is already working on a plan to resume flights once the war concludes. Dubrevskyy expressed 
Ryanair's $3 Billion Investment Plan for Ukraine Post-War with Russia
confidence that Boryspil Airport would continue to serve as a crucial gateway for the return of Ukrainian citizens and 
play a leading role in the nation's economic recovery.
Ryanair's investment plan is a beacon of hope for Ukraine's post-war resurgence, with the potential to bolster the 
country's aviation industry and offer much-needed connectivity to the global market.

Monday 24 July
The action kicks off on Monday with Vodafone Group PLC (LSE:VOD), the worst performing share on the FTSE 
100 over the past 12 months, where a first-quarter trading update is "likely to be mixed", according to analysts.
There are a few other FTSE 350 reporters, including Warhammer owner Games Workshop Group PLC 
(LSE:GAW), which after a difficult 2022, has risen just over 100% since lows in October, with investors wondering if 
momentum can be maintained in the same vein as a solid update last month.
In the US, not earnings but worth noting, the changes will become effective of a 'special rebalance' of the Nasdaq 
100 index, to reduce the weightings of the largest names in the index, including Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia and Meta.

Unilever PLC (LSE:ULVR), the fourth of the £100bn-plus companies on the Footsie index, has benefited from 
inflation in the past year but this may be running out, some analysts reckon.
There could be some hard questions about its Russian operations too, with the company saying it was not pulling 
out as it was "not straightforward" as it was accused of contributing £579mln a year to the Russian economy.
It's a huge day later in the US, with Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) 
both unveiling earnings after the market close.
As the second and third largest US tech companies, 6.4% and 11.4% of respective weightings in the Nasdaq 
Composite index, their reports will be key after the big wobble on the back of disappointing earnings from Tesla and 
Netflix the preceding week.
Google's parent company Alphabet is set to post a mixed set of earnings, with analysts and investors fascinated to 
hear what it has to say about artificial intelligence (AI) developments into its search and other businesses.
AI will certainly be on the menu at Microsoft, which recently saw its shares achieve their highest valuation of all time 
after disclosing a premium pricing model for its generative AI software suite.

Wednesday 26 July
Although Wednesday is Fed day, before that there's going to be a raft of news from big FTSE companies.
Lloyds Banking Group PLC (LSE:LLOY) is chief among them, especially as it is among the lenders being tipped to 
pull in billions from what politicians have described as sharp practice: quickly hiking mortgage rates and slowly 
nudging up those for savings.
Mega busy week ahead with AstraZeneca , Shell , Unilever , Lloyds , Microsoft , Alphabet and much more
Lloyds is among those forecast to hike its full-year guidance next week, though if it does so, will it be happy to 
handle the howl of injustice from its customers?
Other Footsie-listed reporters on the day include British American Tobacco PLC (LSE:BATS), seventh worst 
performing shares on the index over the past year, amid worries about its debt, calls for vaping bans and a new 
CEO cautioning that the year is going to be "complex". 
GSK PLC (LSE:GSK, NYSE:GSK) shares have been trading near year's lows earlier this month, despite the out-of-
court Zantac deal and good news on a groundbreaking gonorrhoea vaccine, indicating that many investors are far 
from convinced boss Emma Walmsley is on the way to catching former close rival AstraZeneca.
Reckitt Benckiser PLC reports for the first time since making an internal promotion, chief customer officer Kris Licht, 
its new CEO, following several other board changes of late.
An analyst recently said after the past seven years of "mishap, drama and volatility", there is a heavy burden on 
Licht to try to put this all in the rear-view mirror.
Later, the US central bank is predicted to resume interest rate hikes after a first pause in 11 meetings.
Markets and economists are expecting a quarter-point raise, with attention on how dovish the policymakers are 
about potential moves higher later in the year.
Also after the US closing bell, there will be earnings from Meta, Coke and Boeing among others.
For the Facebook and Instagram owner, analysts are predicting improvement in advertising revenue, though the 
shares were faltering at the end of the week before the earnings update following a 150% surge in the year to date.

Like its US counterpart, the ECB is expected to hike interest rates on Thursday, with president Christine Lagarde 
likely to suggest more increases are on their way.
Mega busy week ahead with AstraZeneca , Shell , Unilever , Lloyds , Microsoft , Alphabet and much more
It's a FTSE 100-fest in terms of company news, led by Shell PLC (LSE:SHEL, NYSE:SHEL), which was recently 
tipped by one broker for having the strongest balance sheet of all the European integrated oil majors.
Ahead of these second-quarter results, the oil colossus unveiled US$3bn of write-downs and said it trading at its 
gas division would be "significantly lower" compared with the previous quarter, due to seasonal factors.
Elsewhere in the energy space, Centrica PLC (LSE:CNA) and Drax were placed 'positive catalyst watch' ahead of 
interim results by JP Morgan, with both forecast to report strong earnings and cash flow, and provide updates on 
how they will allocate capital.
BT Group PLC (LSE:BT.A) is predicted to announce a strong first quarter on the back of its recent big price hikes, 
analysts reckon, though its shares are the fourth worst performer on the FTSE 100 for the past 12 months. 
Barclays PLC (LSE:BARC) is more geared to the global market than either Lloyds or Natwest who report this week. 
With rival US 'bulge bracket' banks slashing jobs due to an absence of deal activity, how its merchant bank is faring 
will be key.

Friday 28 July
Following an update from smaller FTSE rival earlier in the week, AstraZeneca PLC (LSE:AZN) gets a chance to 
show the City why it's top dog of the blue chip index, having hit an all-time high in April but retreated since.
British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (LSE:IAG) has the potential to outperform as 
major airlines benefit from strong passenger demand, one investment bank said ahead of these second-quarter 
results.

Another downgraded across the sector due to a predicted drop in air fares, while investors may also be interested in 
what is said about the Russian cyberattack earlier in the summer.
Elsewhere, NatWest Group PLC (LSE:NWG) and Standard Chartered PLC (LSE:STAN) close off the week's 
banking updates.
The former has more of a UK focus but some investment banking interest, while the latter has strongly 
outperformed since late May.
In the first quarter, StanChart upped its full-year guidance after a strong first quarter, with profits up by 25% and a 
promise to pay out US$5bn to shareholders by 2024.
Later in the day, US earnings include Chevron and Exxon Mobil, where investors solidly rejected climate change 
proposals at the US oil majors' annual meetings back in May.

Court rules Ryanair 's case against On The Beach can proceed

An online travel agency (OTA) has failed in its bid to strike out a lawsuit brought against it by Ryanair (FR, Dublin 
International). In a decision welcomed by the airline, Ireland's Court of Appeal dismissed the application by OTA On 
The Beach during a July 17 hearing.
"We welcome this court ruling which ensures that justice will be pursued without undue obstacles," said Ryanair's 
marketing director, Dara Brady. "Ryanair does not have a commercial relationship with On The Beach, and we 
strongly object to On The Beach selling our flights."
According to The Irish Times, the matter dates back to 2010 when Ryanair sued the OTA for bundling its flights into 
holiday packages, saying On The Beach had no permission to do so, that it infringed the terms and conditions of its 
ticket sales, and copyright in its database.
Aside from defending its position, UK-based On The Beach questioned the jurisdiction of the Irish courts to hear the 
matter, a question settled in Ryanair's favour in 2015 by the High Court and later, the Supreme Court. The case lay 
dormant until 2021, when the OTA went back to the courts asking for it to be struck out because of the time-lapse, 
arguing Ryanair did not intend to proceed with the case but preferred to use the existence of the case and its claims 
of screen scraping fare data to smear it. Ryanair opposed the application.
A June 2022 High Court ruling criticised Ryanair's delay in proceeding with the matter but said the balance of 
justice "clearly favours the continuance of the proceedings." This week's ruling dealt with On The Beach's appeal of 
this decision.
The three-judge Appeals Court bench did not consider the time lag question as that was not part of this appeal. 
Instead, it looked at whether it would be just to dismiss the proceedings. Ruling against the OTA, the judges said 
that On The Beach's case was "really very weak" and that there would be explicit prejudice against Ryanair if they 
dismissed the case.
Brady said the decision reinforced the low-cost carrier's determination to "pursue justice to ensure our customers 
get the best Ryanair service and the lowest fares." A spokesperson for On The Beach told ch-aviation that they 
were disappointed by the result. "It is worth highlighting the status quo in the underlying action has not changed, 
and the case merely continues," the spokesperson said.
Court rules Ryanair 's case against On The Beach can proceed
Ryanair has an established history of preventing or attempting to prevent unauthorised third parties, including 
OTAs, from selling its tickets. It also makes the sale process cumbersome for authorised resellers, preferring to 
drive potential passengers to its booking portal. Consequently, the airline has become embroiled in a series of long-
running claims and counterclaims against various entities, with varying degrees of success.

Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, has announced its plans to invest heavily in Ukraine's aviation sector once the war 
with Russia is over and the airspace is reopened for commercial flights. The Irish low-cost carrier said it will base up 
to 30 new Boeing 737 MAX aircraft worth over $3 billion at the three main Ukrainian airports in Kyiv, Lviv and 
Odesa, and operate 600 weekly flights to over 20 EU capitals and domestic destinations.
Ryanair Group CEO Michael O'Leary said that the airline was Ukraine's second-largest airline before the Russian 
invasion in February 2022, and that it will return with low fares and reliable service as soon as the skies over 
Ukraine are safe again. He also said that Ryanair will create thousands of new jobs in aviation for Ukrainian citizens 
and support the recovery of the country's economy.
The announcement was made during a visit by O'Leary and other senior executives of Ryanair to Kyiv, where they 
met with Deputy Prime Minister for Restoration of Ukraine and Minister for Infrastructure Oleksandr Kubrakov, and 
toured the Boryspil International Airport. Kubrakov thanked Ryanair for its loyalty and leadership in the recovery of 
Ukraine's aviation industry, and said that the government is working on solutions and investment plans to enable 
flights to resume as soon as possible.
Ryanair launched its first flights to Ukraine in 2018, and operated from five airports in Kyiv, Lviv, Odesa, Kharkiv 
and Kherson before the war. It currently employs hundreds of Ukrainian pilots, cabin crew and IT professionals. It is 
the first new mainline airline in the US in nearly 15 years, and operates flights to more than 20 destinations across 
25 states.

Brussels Airlines (SN, Brussels National) has filed a formal complaint with the European Commission concerning 
state aid provided to Brussels Charleroi airport in the form of subsidised taxes, the airline has confirmed to ch-
aviation.
The grievance pertains to "terminal navigation charges" (TNCs), a fee airspace manager, Skeyes, collects for each 
take-off. While airlines operating at Brussels National are required to contribute a portion of this payment; at 
regional airports like Charleroi, the entire amount is covered by the authorities.
"We can confirm that Brussels Airlines lodged a formal state aid complaint with the European Commission, 
requesting the restoration of a level playing field in the Belgian air transport market," an airline spokeswoman said 
in a statement shared with ch-aviation.
"Brussels Airlines, for example, expresses serious concerns about the exemption of the terminal navigation charges 
(TNC) at Brussels South Charleroi Airport resulting in an unfair advantage for users [of the airport]. We don't ask for 
any exceptional or favourable treatment, we just request a level playing field in the Belgian air transport market."
According to reports by Brussels Times and Belga News Agency, the Lufthansa Group subsidiary's newly 
appointed Chief Executive Officer, Dorothea von Boxberg, has expressed concerns about the apparent lack of 
equitable treatment between regional airports and Brussels Airport.
She said the disparity was particularly harmful to Brussels Airlines in the face of competition from low-cost carriers 
like Ryanair (FR, Dublin International), the primary operator at Charleroi airport.
Although informal discussions have attempted to address the issue, Brussels Airlines now believes the situation is 
too detrimental to its interests. The airline is hopeful the European Commission's investigation will result in a "level 
playing field" by appropriately imposing taxes at different airports, thereby restoring balance and fairness in the 
aviation industry.
According to the ch-aviation capacities module, Ryanair has more than 80% market share in terms of weekly airline 
seats at Charleroi Airport.

Brussels Airlines (SN, Brussels National) has filed a formal complaint with the European Commission concerning 
state aid provided to Brussels Charleroi airport in the form of subsidised taxes, the airline has confirmed to ch-
aviation.
The grievance pertains to "terminal navigation charges" (TNCs), a fee airspace manager, Skeyes, collects for each 
take-off. While airlines operating at Brussels National are required to contribute a portion of this payment; at 
regional airports like Charleroi, the entire amount is covered by the authorities.
"We can confirm that Brussels Airlines lodged a formal state aid complaint with the European Commission, 
requesting the restoration of a level playing field in the Belgian air transport market," an airline spokeswoman said 
in a statement shared with ch-aviation.
"Brussels Airlines, for example, expresses serious concerns about the exemption of the terminal navigation charges 
(TNC) at Brussels South Charleroi Airport resulting in an unfair advantage for users [of the airport]. We don't ask for 
any exceptional or favourable treatment, we just request a level playing field in the Belgian air transport market."
According to reports by Brussels Times and Belga News Agency, the Lufthansa Group subsidiary's newly 
appointed Chief Executive Officer, Dorothea von Boxberg, has expressed concerns about the apparent lack of 
equitable treatment between regional airports and Brussels Airport.

Europe's largest low-cost airline Ryanair plans to invest over $3 billion to rebuild Ukraine's aviation industry once 
the war ends and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) declares flying into and out of Ukraine is safe 
again.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary also promised a swift restart of flights in Ukraine after the end of the war, following a 
trip to Kiev on Thursday.
Ryanair will resume flights eight weeks after airspace reopens, the company said after meeting Ukrainian 
government representatives.
Up to 30 aircraft will be stationed at Kiev, Lviv and Odessa airports and 600 flights a week will be offered to 20 EU 
capitals, O'Leary said during the visit.
Within five years, the offer is to be doubled from initially five to 10 million seats per year.
Ryanair said it was the second largest airline in Ukraine before the invasion.
The airports in Kharkiv and Kherson are also to be returned to as soon as the infrastructure has been restored, 
O'Leary said in a statement.
Ryanair managers met Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister for Restoration of Ukraine and Infrastructure Minister 
Oleksandr Kubrakov, a company statement said.
They also discussed Ukraine's main airports, Kiev, Lviv and Odessa in Boryspil International Airport, invited by 
Oleksiy Dubrevskyy, who heads Boryspil International Airport.
The Ryanair senior management examined the condition of airport terminals, baggage claim and passenger check-
in and boarding gate areas, control points, and aprons during the visit.
Ryanair to invest $3 billion, restart flights to Ukraine after war
Ryanair also plans to open daily domestic flights between Kiev, Lviv, and Odessa, as soon as the airports are 
operational.
Ryanair will base up to 30 new Boeing 737 MAX aircraft worth over $3 billion at the three main Ukrainian airports, 
"giving Ukrainian citizens and visitors access to Europe's lowest air fares, as Ukraine rebuilds its economy in a post 
invasion environment," the statement said.
Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly 17 months ago. "Ryanair was Ukraine's second largest 
airline before the unlawful Russian invasion in February 2022," O'Leary said.
"Once the skies over Ukraine have reopened for commercial aviation, Ryanair will charge back into Ukraine linking 
the main Ukraine airports with over 20 EU capitals, and we are working closely with the Ukrainian government to 
rebuild Ukraine's aviation, industry and its economy."
"The fastest way to rebuild and restore the Ukrainian economy will be with low fare air travel," he said.

 Irish low-cost airline group Ryanair [1]is committing heavily to the Ukrainian aviation sector by promising to base 30 
aircraft in the country when the war is over and Ukraine is declared safe to fly to and from by EASA. Ryanair 
commits to five-year growth plan for Ukraine. 
Top management, including Group CEO Michael O'Leary, made this commitment during a visit to Kyiv and Boryspil 
International Airport on Thursday. 
The airport has been closed for commercial services since February 24 last year, when Russia launched attacks on 
Ukraine and its 'special military operation'.  
While Kyiv has come under frequent attacks from rockets and drones, Boryspil has remained largely unscathed. 
O'Leary and CEO Eddie Wilson were shown around the airport by CEO Olyksiy Dubrevskyy and Oleksandr 
Kubrakov, Ukrainian Minister of Transportation amongst others. 
This confirmed that the terminal building, check-in area, bagage and boarding areas, and apron are in a good 
condition. They could become operational relatively quickly once the airport reopens. 
First services to start after eight weeks 
O'Leary said that Ryanair is committed to return to Ukraine within eight weeks after hostilities have ended. The 
carrier intends to operate 600 weekly flights to and from Kyiv, Odesa, and Lviv as soon as the airports are 
reopened. Other airlines, notably airBaltic, have also said before that they will be the first to operate to Ukraine after 
the war. 
The Ukrainian government and Ryanair said today that under a five-year plan, the airline will grow seat capacity to 
five million in the first twelve months. After five years, this should have doubled to ten million seats. The airline 
intends to base thirty aircraft at the three main airports, which equals a $3.0 billion fleet investment. Once it is safe, 
Kharkiv and Cherson will be added to the network. 
In a media statement, O'Leary says: 'Ryanair was Ukraine's second largest airline before the unlawful Russian 
invasion in Feb 2022. Once the skies over Ukraine have reopened for commercial aviation, Ryanair will charge 
back into Ukraine linking the main Ukraine airports with over 20 EU capitals, and we are working closely with the 
Ukrainian Government to rebuild Ukraine's aviation, industry and its economy.' 
Ryanair commits to five-year growth plan for Ukraine
Dubrevskyy said: 'The visit of Ryanair senior management to Boryspil Airport is a powerful signal that the largest 
airline in Europe sees huge potential in the Ukrainian air transport market. We, meanwhile, are ready to move from 
strategic planning to specific operational actions when the airspace becomes open and safe for civil aviation. I 
strongly believe that Boryspil Airport will remain the main air gate for the return of our citizens to Ukraine and will 
continue to play a leading role in the recovery of the Ukrainian economy.'

 * The company secures 4th place in Romania, by market share HiSky continues to break records in the growth rate 
of passenger numbers. 
537 thousand people flew with HiSky in 2023, according to the traffic data, reported after the first two quarters. By 
comparison, in the first six months of the previous year, the company recorded 194 thousand passengers. 
According to estimates based on the scheduled flights this season, the number of one million transported 
passengers, this year, will be reached in September. The report consolidates HiSky's position as the fourth largest 
airline operator in the Romanian market, after Wizzair, Ryanair, and Tarom, and the second most important airline 
registered in our Romania. The most significant traffic volume was recorded in June, with 160 thousand 
passengers, double compared to 2022, followed, in order, by the months of May and April with 110, respectively 
107 thousand. The growth trend is expected to remain constant, with August predicted to be the busiest month in 
the company's history. "We anticipated that this year's summer season would get close to 2019 values in terms of 
demand for passenger air transport services. Our company started operating in 2020, so this is the first season 
where we have the opportunity to demonstrate our capacity in a well-performing market. The pandemic years, 
although extremely complicated, gave us time to prepare for this growth. We purchased new aircraft and managed 
to build a fleet that we can rely on, so as not to have to cancel flights due to technical issues. We operate on regular 
routes to the most sought-after destinations and have concluded partnerships with the largest tour operators. This 
series of good decisions that we managed to make is fully reflected in the figures." says Iulian Scorpan, CEO of 
HiSky. In terms of traffic by operational base, Otopeni remains the airport with the most significant contribution to 
recorded volumes, with 252 thousand passengers, followed by Chisinau airport, with 152 thousand, and Cluj, with 
92 thousand. The spectacular increase in the number of passengers, this spring and the first month of the summer 
season, is also due to the addition of operational capacity, up to eight aircraft. Along with the two Airbus A321LRs, 
included in the fleet at the beginning of April, another aircraft was contracted, leased from a foreign company. Thus, 
HiSky reaches a capacity of nearly 1500 seats. HiSky operates direct international flights from Romania departing 
from the airports of Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Timisoara, Ia?i, and Baia Mare to Barcelona, Malaga, Tel Aviv, 
Brussels, Paris, and Dublin. From the Republic of Moldova, passengers can travel with HiSky to nine foreign 
destinations: Milan, Paris, Dublin, Frankfurt, Tel Aviv, Rome, Bologna, London and Venice. (PHoto:HiSky)

Italy's nationwide air traffic strike on Saturday resulted in nearly 1,000 flight cancellations, the news agency ANSA 
reported on Sunday.
According to the unions, which had called for the strike, nearly 100% of employees expected to strike participated in 
the action, the agency said.
The walkout affected airport ground staff, which are responsible, among other things, for handling and check-in 
services.
At Italy's major airports in Rome, Milan, Naples and Venice alone, several hundred flights were cancelled, affecting 
about 250,000 passengers.
The consumer protection association Codacons believes that damages due to cancellations and delays were in the 
millions, ANSA reported further.
In addition to ground staff, pilots of Malta Air, who handle Ryanair flights in Italy, and pilots and flight attendants of 
budget airline Vueling also went on strike.
This was the second major walkout in Italy, following a rail strike on Thursday that caused significant problems for 
public transport.
The strikes are hitting the country, a popular holiday destination, in the middle of the peak travel season and during 
a heat wave with high temperatures.

Strikes by airport and airline staff grounded hundreds of flights and left thousands of travellers stranded in Europe 
on Saturday at the height of the busy summer tourism season.
In Italy, some 1,000 flights, both domestic and international, were cancelled as a result of the strike by ground crew, 
according to airport and airline authorities.
Another 120 flights due to depart and arrive from Belgium's Charleroi airport were cancelled Saturday and Sunday, 
triggered by a walkout of budget carrier Ryanair pilots over working conditions.
Italy's strike alone left some 250,000 travellers stranded in one of the world's top tourist spots.
It comes amid a record heatwave, billed by the national weather service as "one of the most intense of all time", that 
would bring temperatures of at least 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) to Rome and 48C to the islands of Sicily 
and Sardinia.
The strike by ground crew, who are demanding a new collective contract six years after the previous one expired, 
was due to last from 10:00 am (0800 GMT) to 6:00 pm (1600 GMT).
The airport in Rome saw some 200 flights cancelled, authorities said.
Flights by Malta Air, which handles transfers for popular budget carriers Ryanair, Vueling and Ita Airways, were also 
affected after pilots joined the walkout.
Milan's airports saw some 150 flight cancellations, while dozens of others were grounded in Turin and Palermo.
Transport Minister Matteo Salvini called the strikers to exercise "common sense" so as "not to harm millions of other 
workers and tourists".

Gatwick faces ground staff strikes during summer peak Airport disruption
Gatwick faces ground staff strikes during summer peak; Airport disruption

Almost 1,000 workers at London's Gatwick airport will strike for eight days in July and August in a dispute over pay, 
putting at risk holidaymakers' plans at the peak of the summer travel season. The union Unite said yesterday that 
950 ground staff would walk out between July 28 and August 1 and between August 4 and August 8, affecting 
airlines including British Airways, EASYJET, Ryanair, Tui, WestJet and Wizz.
Gatwick, the UK's second-busiest airport, is a major hub for flights to Europe and some intercontinental routes. 
Most schools in England close next week and demand for travel is expected to surge.
Unite said it had been in talks over pay with employers ASC, Menzies Aviation, GGS and DHL Services since 
January, but all had "failed to make offers that meet the workers' expectations".
The union said ASC had offered a pay 7.9 per cent rise for 2023 and an increase of 4 per cent in 2024. DHL offered 
8.5 per cent for 2023, while GGS offered 10 per cent over three years alongside a productivity bonus of 2 per cent.
Menzies said it had offered a rise of 11 per cent for 2023.
Dominic Rothwell, the union's regional officer, said the stoppages would "inevitably cause severe delays" but 
blamed the companies.
The move by staff at Gatwick comes weeks after more than 2,000 Unite members working as security staff at 
Heathrow called off a "summer of strife"
Gatwick faces ground staff strikes during summer peak Airport disruption
after agreeing a revised pay offer.
Unite is also balloting members for a walkout at three other Gatwick-based companies. It said voting was expected 
to close at the end of this month and strikes could begin by mid-August.
Phil Lloyd, senior vice-president UK at Menzies Aviation, said it was in "continued discussions with airline partners". 
British Airways said its ground handling agent, GGS, was "surprised" by Unite's announcement and "continuing to 
work with the union to resolve this issue as a matter of urgency so as not to disrupt ... customers' travel plans". DHL 
said it continued "to work closely with Unite to reach a satisfactory conclusion for all parties".
Gatwick airport and ASC did not respond to requests for comment.

Tourists across Italy will have to change their holiday plans as hundreds of flights were cancelled amid an air 
transport strike two days after a train work stoppage.
While disruptive actions by transport unions often take place during summertime &#8211; a peak season for Italy 
&#8211; the strike on Saturday from 10am to 6pm (from 08:00 to 16:00 GMT) is held amid a tourism boom following 
two years of pandemic losses.
Some 1,000 flights, both domestic and international, were cancelled as a result of the strike by ground crew, who 
are demanding a new collective contract, six years after the previous one expired, according to airport and airline 
authorities.
Another 120 flights due to depart and arrive from Belgium's Charleroi airport were cancelled Saturday and Sunday,

Italy's strike alone left some 250,000 travellers stranded in one of the world's top tourist spots. It comes amid a

temperatures of at least 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) to Rome and 48C (118F) to the islands of 
Sicily and Sardinia.
National carrier ITA said it cancelled 133 flights, most of them domestic but a few were to European destinations 
such as Madrid, Amsterdam and Barcelona.
Striking workers included pilots, flight attendants, baggage handlers and airport personnel.
Naples' airport website showed dozens of flights cancelled starting at 10am (08:00 GMT).
Transport minister Matteo Salvini called on the strikers to exercise "common sense" so as "not to harm millions of

Labour unions Filt Cgil, Uiltrasporti and Ugl Trasporto said they called the strike over "absolutely unsatisfactory" 
contract disagreements with Malta Air, which operates Ryanair flights. Ryanair posted a note on its website 
apologising for cancellations and other disruptions due to the strike that is "beyond our control".
On Thursday, commuters and tourists were stranded at sweltering train stations across the country as a strike by 
rail workers crippled services including high-speed trains that are usually guaranteed.

Pilots of budget airline Ryanair are on strike in Belgium this weekend over pay cuts, leading to the cancellation of 
120 flights to and from Charleroi airport, news agency Belga reported.
The pilots are demanding that their salaries be restored to levels before the Covid-19 pandemic.
Pilots had at the time accepted a temporary pay cut to help the firm ride out the financial impact of the travel 
restrictions imposed during the pandemic.
Pilots also reported issues with their rest periods, according to Belgian media.
Several meetings held between pilots' representatives and Ryanair failed to resolve the dispute, meaning 80% of 
Ryanair pilots based at Charleroi airport went on strike.
In total 120 flights from and to Charleroi airport have been cancelled, of which 62 were scheduled for Saturday and 
58 for Sunday.

Travellers at Italian airports are preparing for delays as ground staff strike and many flights are cancelled on 
Saturday.
The Italian consumer protection association Codacons estimated that around 1,000 flights and more than 250,000 
passengers could be affected by the strike. Ground staff are striking from 10 am to 6 pm (0800-1600 GMT).
Hundreds of flights, including ones to and from Germany, have already been cancelled. Airports have been urging 
people to check the status of their flights before travelling.
In addition to ground staff striking, pilots working for Air Malta, who handle Ryanair flights in Italy, plan to strike from 
12 pm to 4 pm.
Pilots and flight attendants working for budget airline Vueling are also called on to strike from 10 am to 6 pm.
Ryanair issued an announcement saying flights to and from Italy would be limited or cancelled due to the strikes.
After a nationwide railway strike on Thursday, this is the second disruption for Italy's public transportation amid the 
peak of Italian travel season and a heat wave.

LONDON (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of British vacationers face potential disruption to their travel plans at the 
start of the school summer holidays, after almost 1,000 workers at London's Gatwick Airport voted to strike in a 
dispute over pay.
The Unite union said Friday that members, including baggage handlers and check-in staff, who are employed by 
four private contractors will walk out for four days from July 28 and again for a subsequent four-day stretch from 
Aug. 4.
The union said the action will “inevitably” cause disruption to flights at the height of the summer holiday season after 
the school year has ended. The airlines affected are British Airways, easyJet, Ryanair, TUI, WestJet and Wizz Air.
Gatwick, which is just south of the U.K. capital, is London's second-busiest airport behind Heathrow, with a 
particular focus during the summer to Europe's beach resorts in the Mediterranean.
A total of 4,410 flights are scheduled to depart Gatwick across all the strike days, equating to more than 840,000 
seats, according to aviation data company Cirium.
Those involved in the dispute are employed by ASC, Menzies Aviation, GGS and DHL Services, which conduct 
outsourced operations for airlines including ground handling, baggage handling and check-in. Unite said it has been 
in negotiations with the four companies since January.
“As part of Unite’s unyielding focus on the jobs, pay and condition of its members, the union has drawn a line in the 
sand and is committed to eradicating the scourge of low pay at the airport," said Sharon Graham, the union’s 
general-secretary.
Phil Lloyd, a senior vice president at Menzies Aviation, one of the companies involved, said Unite rejected its offer 
for an 11% pay rise for its ground services employees at Gatwick, which he added is on top of last year's 10% 
increase.
Hundreds of thousands face disruption at London's Gatwick Airport this summer after strike vote
“We are in continued discussions with our airline partners and remain committed to seeking a resolution," he said.
Britain has witnessed an array of strikes over the past few months as workers across various sectors try to get 
wage raises that at least keep pace with inflation. Though inflation has fallen from its peak, it remains high at 8.7%. 
Unite said the majority of workers who are set to strike are paid an average of under 12 pounds ($15.50) an hour.
Gatwick, like other airports in Europe, is already suffering major disruption because of air traffic control restrictions 
as a result of strike action, staff shortages and airspace closures related to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
“We are aware of the recent ballot result and will support our airlines with their contingency plans to ensure that 
flights operate as scheduled," a spokesperson for the airport said.

Gatwick Airport will suffer eight days of strikes over the summer holidays as almost a thousand workers 
represented by the Unite union fight for better pay.
The strikes will take place between Friday July 28 and Tuesday August 1 and then again between Friday August 4 
and Tuesday 8 August - a period which could be the busiest time for travel since the pandemic.
Major airlines which will be affected include British Airways, EasyJet, Ryanair, Tui and Wizz Air.
Given the scale of the industrial action flight cancellations, delays and severe disruption is expected across the 
whole airport.
Workers undertaking roles like baggage and ground handling and check-in agents are hoping for an increase to 
their £12 per hour average salary.
Unite claims despite the "highly demanding" labour required of the staff, workforces at the airport have suffered 
large-scale redundancies, pay cuts and reductions to working conditions.  
Talks between the union and the airport workers' employers have been taking place since January but a suitable 
offer is yet to be tabled.

Sharon Graham, Unite general secretary, said: "Our members at Gatwick Airport undertake incredibly demanding 
roles and are essential to keeping the airport and airlines working, yet their employers somehow think it is 
acceptable to pay them a pittance.
"As part of Unite's unyielding focus on the jobs, pay and condition of its members the union has drawn a line in the 
sand and is committed to eradicating the scourge of low pay at the airport."
Rail workers and junior doctors are also striking for better pay, with workers having been embroiled in talks for 
almost a year.

European travelers and airlines are preparing for a summer travel season with fewer disruptions compared to the 
chaos experienced last year, as the aviation industry adapts to post-pandemic conditions. Airports and airlines have 
made significant efforts to coordinate operations, minimize disruptions, and accommodate passenger demand. 
Although overall European air passenger traffic is still below pre-pandemic levels, some markets have fully 
recovered.
Demand for air travel remains strong, with May seeing a 16.2% year-on-year increase in total passengers, 
according to Airports Council International (ACI). However, flight prices have significantly risen since the pandemic, 
surpassing the rate of inflation in Europe. European airfares in May were up 36% compared to the previous year, 
despite eurozone inflation being at 6.1% for the same period.
Experts believe that airfares are likely to remain higher than pre-pandemic levels due to factors such as increased 
carbon emissions costs, inflation, and rising labor wages for airline staff. Low-cost carriers like Wizz Air and Ryanair 
may benefit from this trend as passengers seek cost-effective travel options.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary previously stated that the era of ultra-low-cost flights, such as (EURO)10 flights, was 
coming to an end, with fares expected to increase gradually over the next few years.
Travelers can expect higher ticket prices but a more stable and less disrupted travel experience during the 
upcoming summer season.

After avoiding strike action at Heathrow, the UK aviation industry is now set to be hit by strikes at London's second 
biggest airport as Gatwick Airport ground workers vote to take eight days of industrial action over the summer.  The 
950 workers, who are members of Unite, the Union, are employed by four companies that operate at the airport and 
which have been in negotiations with the union since January 2023 but have failed to reach a deal.  Unite general 
secretary Sharon Graham said the union had drawn a line in the sand as the majority of the workers were earning 
under £12 ($15) an hour: "Our members at Gatwick Airport undertake incredibly demanding roles and are essential 
to keeping the airport and airlines working, yet their employers somehow think it is acceptable to pay them a 
pittance."  The Unite workers work for ASC, Menzies Aviation, GGS and DHL Services on behalf of many of the 
UK's major airlines and represent about half of all ground staff at the airport.  Unite members working for DHL 
Gatwick Direct, Red Handling and Wilson James are also currently being balloted on strike action with the ballots 
closing at the end of July.  According to the union, the airlines that will be affected by the walkouts at the end of July 
and beginning of August will include British Airways, Easyjet, Ryanair, TUI, Westjet and Wizz.  Spokespeople for 
EasyJet, DHL, GGS and Menzies Aviation told the BBC that the ground-handling companies were all continuing to 
work with Unite on reaching a solution to avoid the strikes with a representative from Menzies saying the union had 
rejected an 11% pay increase offer.  The first period of action will take place between Friday 28 July and Tuesday 1 
August, with the second period happening the following weekend between Friday 4 August and Tuesday 8 August.

The Zacks Airline  industry has been benefiting from buoyant air travel demand, following the easing of COVID-19 
travel restrictions and the reopening of the global economy. The industry is witnessing a solid recovery in demand 
for domestic as well as international flights. People are again booking flights, thereby leading to higher passenger 
revenues, which contribute to the bulk of most airlines' top lines.
Notably, the Zacks Airline  industry has risen 37.7% so far this year, outperforming 12.6% growth of the broader 
Zacks Transportation  sector and the 17.4% rise of the Zacks S&P 500 composite.
The buoyancy in the industry is further confirmed by its Zacks Industry Rank  #45, which places it in the top 18% of 
more than 250 Zacks industries.
Driven by the buoyant scenario with respect to air traffic, Copa Holdings CPA, Azul S.A. AZUL, Gol Linhas Aereas 
Inteligentes GOL and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY reported impressive traffic numbers for May. CPA currently sports a 
Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while RYAAY has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. GOL and AZUL carry a Zacks Rank 
#3 (Hold) each.
Let's take an in-depth look at these companies' June traffic reports.
Driven by high passenger volumes, Copa Holdings' revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) rose 14.9% in 
June on a year-over-year basis. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In June, available seat 
miles (a measure of capacity) increased 10.7% year over year. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, 
the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved to 86.8% from 83.7% in June 2022.
Brazilian carrier, Azul, reported a double-digit year-over-year increase in traffic and capacity for June 2023. AZUL's 
consolidated revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of air traffic) and available seat kilometers (a measure of 
capacity) increased 15% and 12.6%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. With consolidated passenger traffic 
growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor improved to 80.9% from 79.3% in June 2022.
Airlines Post Impressive June Traffic Numbers: An Analysis
On the domestic front, with revenue passenger kilometers (2%) outpacing available seat kilometers (0.6%), the load 
factor increased to 79.1% from 78% in June 2022. Internationally, revenue passenger kilometers and available seat 
kilometers increased 92.8% and 94.2%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The load factor was 87.3%.
Gol Linhas also reported a double-digit year-over-year increase in traffic and capacity for June 2023. In June, 
consolidated revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 14% and 15.4%, respectively, 
on a year-over-year basis. The load factor was 75.7%. The number of flight departures at GOL in June registered a 
20.8% year-over-year increase. Consolidated passengers on board rose 21% year over year.
On the domestic front, with revenue passenger kilometers (12.9%) outpacing available seat kilometers (12.4%), the 
load factor increased to 76% from 75.7% in June 2023.
Domestic departures, accounting for more than 95% of the total departures during the month, grew 19.4% on a 
year-over-year basis. On the domestic front, the number of seats increased by 20.3% in June. International 
departures surged 62.1% in June on a year-over-year basis. The number of seats surged 65.1% internationally.
On the domestic front, passengers on board rose 20.6% year over year. Internationally, the metric increased by 
31.2% year over year.
European carrier Ryanair also reported impressive traffic numbers for June 2023, driven by upbeat air-travel 
demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in June was 17.4 million. This compared favorably 
with the May 2023 figure of 17 million and 15.9 million in June 2022. Owing to upbeat traffic, the load factor was 
high at 95% in June 2023. The reading was similar to that reported a year ago. RYAAY operated more than 96,250 
flights in June 2023.

 Almost 1,000 workers at Gatwick Airport, including baggage handlers and check-in staff, will stage eight days of 
strikes from later this month. 
Staff will strike in a dispute over pay, the union Unite announced, at the start of the school summer holidays. 
Significant disruption, delays and cancellations are 'inevitable', the union said. 
The workers will strike initially for four days beginning on Friday 28 July and ending on Tuesday 1 August. 
A further four days of strikes are scheduled to take place from Friday 4 August until Tuesday 8 August. 
Hundreds of thousands of flights across Europe this summer are already in jeopardy following a vote by air traffic 
controllers to take strike action. 
Up to 12,600 flights every day - around a third of the journeys made across the continent during the peak summer 
holiday period - could be delayed or cancelled as a result of the industrial action. 
Workers at Eurocontrol, which manages European airspace, have said they will walk out in a dispute over pay, 
working hours and staffing issues. 
An industry source told The Times newspaper: 'In a full-blown strike, 20 to 30% of flights would be at least delayed.' 
Budget airline easyJet announced earlier this month that it had been forced to cancel 1,700 flights during the peak 
summer holiday season in response to the impact of air traffic control strikes in Europe and knock-on effects of the 
closure of airspace due to the Russia-Ukraine war. 
The airline said it would mostly consolidate some services to and from Gatwick Airport, its busiest operation, 
between July and September in a bid to eradicate the threat of disruption to its customers' holiday plans. 
It said that Gatwick flights had been most exposed to strikes in France. 
Ryanair, which has blamed the air traffic controllers' action for disruption to 1.1 million passengers, has previously 
called for the European Commission to intervene to protect services. 
A Eurocontrol spokesperson said earlier this month that a trade union 'announced a period of six months during 
which industrial action could take place' in its network manager operations centre. 
'No specific dates for industrial action have been announced; this was a pre-warning,' they said. 
The company is 'actively engaging with all social partners' and is 'committed to finding solutions through social 
dialogue', the spokesperson added. 
Gatwick Airport staff to strike at start of summer holidays
Last month, security staff at Heathrow Airport called off all strikes and voted in favour of a pay deal. 
Members of the Unite union had been due to walk out across nearly every weekend from mid-June until the end of 
August. 
The pay deal included a 10% pay increase backdated to 1 January, effective from workers' July payslip; a further 
pay rise of 1.5% from October; and a guaranteed inflation-linked pay increase for 2024. 
Unite said the agreement was equivalent to an increase of between 15.5% and 17.5 %, depending on staff pay 
bands. 
The deal also promised improved maternity and paternity pay, the end of switching staff between terminals without 
warning and the end of placing agency workers in security roles, as soon as Heathrow can make the changes. 
Meanwhile, at Birmingham Airport, around 100 security officers and terminal technicians will begin continuous strike 
action from 18 July. 
The strikes will severely impact the airport's security and terminal maintenance, leading to flight delays, the Unite 
union said.

 The Zacks Airline[1] industry has been benefiting from buoyant air travel demand, following the easing of COVID-
19 travel restrictions and the reopening of the global economy. The industry is witnessing a solid recovery in 
demand for domestic as well as international flights. People are again booking flights, thereby leading to higher 
passenger revenues, which contribute to the bulk of most airlines' top lines. 
Notably, the Zacks Airline[1] industry has risen 37.7% so far this year, outperforming 12.6% growth of the broader 
Zacks Transportation[2] sector and the 17.4% rise of the Zacks S&P 500 composite. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The buoyancy in the industry is further confirmed by its Zacks Industry Rank[3] #45, which places it in the top 18% 
of more than 250 Zacks industries. 
Driven by the buoyant scenario with respect to air traffic, Copa HoldingsCPA[4], Azul S.A. AZUL[5], Gol Linhas 
Aereas Inteligentes GOL[6] and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[7] reported impressive traffic numbers for May. CPA 
currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while RYAAY has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. GOL and AZUL 
carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.[8] 
Let's take an in-depth look at these companies' June traffic reports. 
Driven by high passenger volumes, Copa Holdings' revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) rose 14.9% in 
June on a year-over-year basis. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In June, available seat 
miles (a measure of capacity) increased 10.7% year over year. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, 
the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved to 86.8% from 83.7% in June 2022. 
Brazilian carrier, Azul, reported a double-digit year-over-year increase in traffic and capacity for June 2023. AZUL's 
consolidated revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of air traffic) and available seat kilometers (a measure of 
capacity) increased 15% and 12.6%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. With consolidated passenger traffic 
growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor improved to 80.9% from 79.3% in June 2022. 
On the domestic front, with revenue passenger kilometers (2%) outpacing available seat kilometers (0.6%), the load 
factor increased to 79.1% from 78% in June 2022. Internationally, revenue passenger kilometers and available seat 
kilometers increased 92.8% and 94.2%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The load factor was 87.3%.

Gol Linhas also reported a double-digit year-over-year increase in traffic and capacity for June 2023. In June, 
consolidated revenue passenger kilometers and available seat kilometers increased 14% and 15.4%, respectively, 
on a year-over-year basis. The load factor was 75.7%. The number of flight departures at GOL in June registered a 
20.8% year-over-year increase. Consolidated passengers on board rose 21% year over year. 
On the domestic front, with revenue passenger kilometers (12.9%) outpacing available seat kilometers (12.4%), the 
load factor increased to 76% from 75.7% in June 2023. 
Domestic departures, accounting for more than 95% of the total departures during the month, grew 19.4% on a 
year-over-year basis. On the domestic front, the number of seats increased 20.3% in June. International departures 
surged 62.1% in June on a year-over-year basis. The number of seats surged 65.1% internationally. 
On the domestic front, passengers on board rose 20.6% year over year. Internationally, the metric increased 31.2% 
year over year. 
European carrier Ryanair also reported impressive traffic numbers for June 2023, driven by upbeat air-travel 
demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in June was 17.4 million. This compared favorably 
with the May 2023 figure of 17 million and 15.9 million in June 2022. Owing to upbeat traffic, the load factor was 
high at 95% in June 2023. The reading was similar to that reported a year ago. RYAAY operated more than 96,250 
flights in June 2023. Year-to-date Price Performance In fact, air traffic has been buoyant throughout the year 
leading to significant year-to-date price appreciation in the above stocks.

 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.

Ryanair resigns from "useless" UK Aviation Council

Highlight: The airline's CEO Michael O'Leary branded the council "useless" after accusing the government of 
taking no action on proposed industry reform.
Body
The UK's largest passenger airline, Ryanair, has resigned from the country's Aviation Council, labelling it a "talking 
shop which delivers no benefits, no reform and no change". CEO Michael O'Leary made the announcement on the 
day of the council's third meeting, after sending a letter to its chair Baroness Vere, saying: "We joined the UK 
Aviation Council in February when Transport Minister Mark Harper assured us it would be used as a 'delivery body' 
to improve the resilience of UK aviation. Sadly, this has proved to be an empty promise. "There has been no action, 
no delivery and no improvement in UK aviation and the council has become a talking shop for Baroness Vere, 
bureaucrats and the CAA to waffle on about reform while delivering none." 
O'Leary also accused the government of taking no action on the five measures introduced by Irish carrier Ryanair at 
the council's first meeting in February. Those measures were: improving air traffic control staffing to reduce delays, 
pushing for effective air space reform in Europe, improving border control staffing, reducing UK visa costs from 
£3,000 to £1,000 per person and restoring temporary IDs at UK airports to improve staffing for this summer season. 
In response to O'Leary's claims, a government spokesperson said: "The Aviation Council was set up to bring the 
industry and government together to address shared challenges facing the sector and ensure the UK aviation 
sector remains one of the strongest and most successful in the world." However, O'Leary said that the government 
should disband the "useless" council and Baroness Vere should instead work directly with the UK's major airlines to 
"deliver real and effective change". While Vere has not yet directly responded to the airline's resignation, she 
posted about the recent council meeting on Twitter, saying: "The only way we can build a modern, innovative and 
forward-facing sector is by working with the aviation industry." Touching on that meeting in its resignation 
announcement, Ryanair said that a proposal to set up a working group to promote UK airspace modernisation 
would not deliver "effective and efficient modernisation", as it would not be reporting until April 2024. The news 
comes amid a period of strong growth for the airline, which recently made a company-record order for up to 300 
Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.

Body
A nationwide strike of transport workers began in Italy on Thursday, with staff of two major railway companies 
walking out of work in the morning.
Staff of the state-owned railway company Trenitalia, and employees of the private competitor Italo, stopped work at 
3 am (0100 GMT) on Thursday morning.
Operations are set to resume immediately after the strike is over, Trenitalia said on Wednesday evening. However, 
it is expected that the delays, some of them severe, could extend throughout the day.
Originally, the walkout was to last until 2 am on Friday morning. After failed negotiations with unions, Italy's 
Infrastructure and Transport Minister Matteo Salvini issued an order to shorten the strike to 12 hours, prompting 
criticism from several unions.
Further travel disruptions are planned for the weekend.
A strike at airports has been announced for Saturday. Ground staff plan to walk out of work from 10 am to 6 pm.
Malta Air pilots, who operate Ryanair flights in Italy, also plan to strike on Saturday from 12 to 4 pm. In addition, 
pilots and flight attendants from the low-cost airline Vueling are also being called to strike on Saturday from 10 am 
to 6 pm.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) said Tuesday that it is exiting from the UK Aviation Council, citing the lack of action and reform 
for UK aviation and passengers over the past six months.
The Irish budget airline referred to the council, led by Baroness Vere, as a "talking shop" after failing to deliver 
measures, including improvements in NATS staffing, air space reform, border control processing times, reduced 
visa costs and improved airport crew.
Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary emphasized that it would rather focus on its growth in the UK without 
relying on support from the government or the council. O'Leary also called for the council's disbandment "to deliver 
real and effective change."
Shares of Ryanair were up 1% as of Tuesday's close.

BUDGET airline Ryanair has resigned from the UK Aviation Council and branded it as a "talking shop" which does 
not deliver benefits or reform for the sector or passengers.
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary accused the organisation, led by Baroness Vere, of being "useless and 
ineffective" on a range of issues in recent months.
The council was set up to bring industry and Government together to help the UK retain its spot as one of the 
world's strongest aviation sectors.
Mr O'Leary, who said the resignation is with immediate effect, said: "If Baroness Vere wants to deliver change or 
improve UK aviation, then she should disband this useless council and work instead with the UK's major airlines to 
deliver real and effective change, which will enable us to improve capacity and lower air fares for UK citizens and 
visitors.
"Instead, Baroness Vere prefers to waste her time, and ours, holding a quarterly talking shop, at which she 
promises action, but delivers none."

the MSCI World Index's return of 6.8%. For the first six months of 2023, the Fund maintained its lead on the index, 
returning 15.3% versus 15.1%. Since inception in 1999, the Fund's compounded annual rate of return has been 
9.4%, which compares to 5.7% for the MSCI World Index and 5.8% for the Lipper Global Fund Index.
For the quarter, our highest contributing securities were Alphabet (
GOOGL ,  Financial ) (U.S.) and Amazon (  AMZN  ,  Financial ) (U.S.), and our largest detractors were Alibaba (  
BABA  ,  Financial ) (China) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (  BUD  ,  Financial ) (Belgium). From a sector perspective, 
our strongest contributors were information technology and financials, and our biggest detractors were consumer 
staples and real estate.
For the calendar six months, the stocks that contributed most to returns were Alphabet, Amazon, Ryanair Holdings (
RYAAY ,  Financial ) (Ireland), Oracle (  ORCL  ,  Financial ) (U.S.) and Mercedes-Benz Group (  XTER:MBG  ,  
Financial ) (Germany). The stocks that detracted most from return were Bank of America (  BAC  ,  Financial ) 
(U.S.), NOV (  NOV  ,  Financial ) (U.S.), CNH Industrial (  CNHI  ,  Financial ) (U.K.), Cushman & Wakefield (  CWK  
,  Financial ) (U.S.), and Glencore (  LSE:GLEN  ,  Financial ) (Switzerland). From a sector perspective, our 
strongest contributors were consumer discretionary and information technology while energy and real estate were 
the largest detractors.
During the quarter, we initiated new positions in Corebridge Financial, Danaher and IQVIA Holdings. We eliminated 
our positions in Arconic, Cushman & Wakefield, NOV, and Tenet Healthcare.
The following is a brief description of our new holdings:
Corebridge Financial (
CRBG ,  Financial ) is a life and retirement company that was partially spun off from American International Group 
(AIG) through an initial public offering in September 2022. Corebridge has extensive, long-standing relationships 
David Herro's Oakmark Global Fund 2nd-Quarter Commentary
with many of the largest financial institutions to sell various retirement products. It is one of the largest retirement 
service providers to the education market through VALIC Financial Advisors. It also operates a high-performing, 
seasoned life insurance business. The market is valuing the company as a variable annuity provider despite its 
much more diversified and stable earnings stream. Part of the discount is due to the lack of liquidity and an 
overhang from AIG's significant ownership, which will eventually be brought to market. Trading at around five times 
our estimate of normalized distributable cash flow, the stock is highly attractive to us, and we are willing to wait for 
the ownership overhang to resolve itself.
Danaher (
DHR ,  Financial ) is a global leader in life sciences that maintains a portfolio of businesses primarily focused on 
bioprocessing, life science tools, genomics and diagnostics. In our view, Danaher has an excellent track record of 
creating shareholder value through smart capital allocation and world-class operational execution. The firm's 
Danaher Business System employs a rigorous, process-driven approach to operational improvement that's helped 
accelerate organic growth and expand margins through multiple leadership regimes. Danaher's business mix has 
shifted dramatically in recent years after a series of transformative acquisitions and divestitures. We believe these 
portfolio moves leave the company attractively positioned in some of the industry's fastest growing, most profitable 
niches. The upgraded portfolio contains premiere assets levered to secular growth areas, like biologics, molecular 
diagnostics, and genomics, that support many years of high-single-digit revenue growth and margin expansion. 
Near-term headwinds related to the pandemic are overshadowing this attractive long-term outlook. Danaher sells 
diagnostic tests and critical inputs needed for manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines. Robust demand for these products 
during the pandemic boosted the stock price in 2020 and 2021. As Covid-19 demand normalized, Danaher 
experienced sales headwinds and channel destocking on these products, which pressured the stock. We believe 
these near-term headwinds will ultimately prove short-lived. Danaher now trades at a discounted valuation relative 
to peers and private market transactions, which provided an attractive entry point to invest in this high-quality, 
resilient business.
Fears about biotech funding and the sell-off in the broader life sciences area created an opportunity for us to invest 
in IQVIA (
IQV ,  Financial ) during the quarter. IQVIA is a leading provider of clinical trials and health care technology and 
analytics formed through the merger of Quintiles and IMS Health in 2016. We believe that IQVIA is positioned at the 
heart of trends toward advanced therapeutics and personalized medicine and that it is the most levered clinical 
research organization (CRO) to decentralized clinical trials requiring digital capabilities. We think that IQVIA has 
additional growth opportunities from delivering real-world evidence to biopharma companies and other health care 
providers using data and software to meet regulatory and reimbursement mandates. CEO Ari Bousbib has a strong 
track record on operations and capital allocation and significant skin in the game through his large equity holdings in 
the company. We were pleased to be able to add IQVIA to the portfolio near a trough multiple of less than 15x our 
estimate of normal earnings.
We eliminated our positions in Arconic (ARNC) and Tenet Healthcare (THC) as they approached our sell targets 
and Arconic entered an agreement to be acquired. We exited our position in Cushman & Wakefield after numerous 
changes in leadership and personnel reduced our confidence in company management. We believe that NOV is still 
undervalued, but we opted to exit the position in favor of ConocoPhillips, which we think is a more attractive 
investment.
Geographically, we ended the quarter with 47% of the portfolio in the U.S., 34% in Europe, 14% in the U.K. and 5% 
in Asia as a percent of equity. Over the second quarter, the U.S., Germany and Ireland contributed most to return 
and China, Belgium and the U.K. detracted the most. For the calendar six months, the U.S., Germany and Ireland 
contributed the most to return while Belgium detracted from returns in the period.
We defensively hedge a portion of the Fund's exposure to currencies that we believe to be overvalued versus the 
U.S. dollar. However, as of quarter end, the Fund's currency exposure is unhedged.
David Herro's Oakmark Global Fund 2nd-Quarter Commentary
We thank you for being our partners in the Oakmark Global Fund. We invite you to send us your comments or 
questions.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  The performance data quoted represents past performance. 
Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return and 
principal value vary so that an investor's shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than the original cost. 
To obtain the most recent month-end performance data,  view it here .
The Fund's portfolio tends to be invested in a relatively small number of stocks. As a result, the appreciation or 
depreciation of any one security held by the Fund will have a greater impact on the Fund's net asset value than it 
would if the Fund invested in a larger number of securities. Although that strategy has the potential to generate 
attractive returns over time, it also increases the Fund's volatility.
Investing in foreign securities presents risks that in some ways may be greater than in U.S. investments. Those 
risks include: currency fluctuation; different regulation, accounting standards, trading practices and levels of 
available information; generally higher transaction costs; and political risks.
The compound return is the rate of return, usually expressed as a percentage that represents the cumulative effect 
that a series of gains or losses has on an original amount of capital over a period of time. Compound returns are 
usually expressed in annual terms, meaning that the percentage number that is reported represents the annualized 
rate at which capital has compounded over time.
The percentages of hedge exposure of each foreign currency are calculated by dividing the market value of all 
same-currency forward contracts by the market value of the underlying equity exposure to that currency.

Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) copped a surprisingly bearish sell rating after Liberum initiated coverage on the 
Hungarian budget airline carrier this week.
Despite being the fastest-growing budget airline in Europe, analysts at broker criticised Wizz Air's pursuit of "less-
competitive but less-attractive markets" in Eastern Europe.
"Strategy going east, value going south," as Liberum's Gerland Khoo put it.
Liberum's outlook is in stark contrast to the broader market consensus. Particularly UBS, which upgraded the 
London-listed airline in June on the prospects of a return to profitability in 2024.
Yet Liberum's contrarian view comes with some reasonable justifications beyond Wizz Air's focus on Eastern 
Europe.
Firstly, the group is leveraged with debt from its extensive use of leases for new aircraft additions, something 
"overlooked in consensus", said Khoo.
"We believe the market is overlooking the impact of higher interest rates on future aircraft ownership costs, as well 
as the significant uplift to lease liabilities as Wizz Air's new aircraft deliveries accelerate in the coming years," the 
research note explained.
Secondly, Wizz Air's "vulnerability to competition" against the likes of Ryanair and easyJet should not be forgotten.
Wizz Air cops surprising bear thesis from analysts
However, low non-fuel unit costs act as a value driver for the carrier, while a favourable balance of industry demand 
to supply adds to the bull-side case.
Regardless, Liberum sees downside on the way, with a target share price of 2,200p against a publication price of 
2,705p.

Ryanair resigns from UK Aviation Council branding it a "talking shop"
Ryanair resigns from UK Aviation Council branding it a "talking shop"

(Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has resigned from the UK Aviation Council and branded it as 
a "talking shop" which does not deliver benefits or reform for the sector or passengers.
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary accused the organisation, led by Baroness Vere, of being "useless and 
ineffective" on a range of issues in recent months.
The council was set up to bring industry and Government together to help the UK retain its spot as one of the 
world's strongest aviation sectors.
The council held its first meeting in February 2023, its second in April was postponed and the third took place on 
Tuesday, Ryanair said.
O'Leary, who said the resignation is with immediate effect, said: "If Baroness Vere wants to deliver change or 
improve UK aviation, then she should disband this useless council and work instead with the UK's major airlines to 
deliver real and effective change, which will enable us to improve capacity and lower air fares for UK citizens and 
visitors.
"Instead, Baroness Vere prefers to waste her time, and ours, holding a quarterly talking shop, at which she 
promises action, but delivers none."
O'Leary said the Dublin-based carrier expects to grow its traffic in the UK in 2023 by 13% to 56 million passengers, 
and all of this is happening "without any support or initiative from the UK Government or its useless Aviation 
Council".
He stated: "We joined the UK Aviation Council in February when Transport Minister Mark Harper assured us it 
would be used as a 'delivery body' to improve the resilience of UK aviation. Sadly, this has proved to be an empty 
promise.
Ryanair resigns from UK Aviation Council branding it a "talking shop"
"There has been no action, no delivery, and no improvement in UK aviation, and the council has become a talking 
shop for Baroness Vere, government bureaucrats and the CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) to waffle on about reform 
while delivering none."
Improvements to National Air Traffic Services staffing to reduce delays, the push for effective air space reform in 
Europe, better Border Control staffing and processing times and a cut to the UK visa costs are among the issues 
the budget airline has raised.

The travel industry is soaring. Hotels are savouring a rebound - even compared with the pre-Covid era - as tourists 
tolerate higher room rates. Airlines are also buoyant, with Ryanair and EASYJET both reporting 'robust' bookings 
and sentiment. Though many in the industry believe the boom may persist, others are more sceptical, saying that 
would-be holidaymakers' budgets will come under pressure from tightening economic conditions. Cork in the revels

Irish ultra-low-cost carrier Ryanair has been ordered to pay (EURO)10,000 ($10,800) to a schoolboy who suffered a 
"terrifying ordeal" onboard a flight in 2018.
Stefan Kokic, now aged 17 (but aged 11 during the incident), was on a Ryanair flight in 2018 from Dublin Airport 
(DUB) to Croatia's Zadar Airport (ZAD) when the aircraft had to make an emergency landing into Frankfurt-Hahn 
Airport (HHN) after the cabin experienced loss of pressure.
According to the Irish Examiner, Barrister Ciaran Mandal told Judge John O'Connor in the Circuit Civil Court on July 
3, 2023 that Kokic underwent a "terrifying ordeal" because of the incident.
"Stefan was involved in an undoubtedly terrifying ordeal," Mandal said.
The 17-year-old had sued Ryanair through his mother, Nikolina Kokic who said in an affidavit that her son had 
suffered emotional upset as a result of the accident but had dealt well with the experience.
Following the incident, Stefan visited his physician twice, and was diagnosed with a degree of stress secondary to 
the incident as well as headaches.
The claim was brought under the Montreal Convention which states the event that occurred had to be an accident 
and the complainant had to have suffered bodily injury in order to recover damages.
Mandal said the airline had belatedly conceded the event was an accident.
On July 3, 2023, Judge John O'Connor in the Circuit Civil Court ordered Ryanair to issue a (EURO)10,000 
settlement offer on the basis of "outstanding issues".
