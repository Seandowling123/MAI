Jun 02, 2021( EU Reporter: http://www.eureporter.co Delivered by Newstex)  
 Join the call for the release of Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega, who are being held by Belarus authorities. 
Find out how you can help. Belarus journalist Protasevich and his girlfriend Sapega were on a flight from Athens to 
Vilnius on 23 May when the Belarusian government forced the plane to redirect to Minsk where they were detained. 
Society[1] 
The move was immediately met with widespread condemnation from all around the world and led to calls for 
sanctions against the country. 
Parliament President David Sassoli said: 'The events in Belarus, with the hijacking of a civil plane to arrest 
opponents of the regime, require a leap forward in our response in both strength and speed.' 
Parliament and other EU institutions are calling for the immediate release of Protasevich and urge everyone to 
speak up about this blatant breach of fundamental rights. 
What you could do to help get Roman Protasevich released 
The abuse of human rights can only thrive in silence. Help create a noise by speaking up for Protasevic and 
Sapega who are currently being silenced and detained. 
What you could do online: 
 Use the hashtag #FreeRomanProtasevich and #FreeSofiaSapega on Twitter and other platformsHelp us to spread 
the message by sharing this article and our posts on social media, such as our tweet[2] 
#FreeRomanProtasevich: EU calls for release of Belarus journalist
 You could come up with your own ways to protest. For example, President Sassoli suggested using airports to 
highlight the cause: 'I think it would be a very positive gesture if a photo of Roman Protasevich were to be displayed 
in the main airports of European Union member states, as a mark of solidarity and to show that we will not fail him.' 
What the EU is doing in response to the actions by Belarus 
EU leaders met a day after the forced redirection of the Ryanair flight to decide on a common response. President 
Sassoli opened the summit with a call for action[3]: 'Our response must be strong, immediate and unified. The 
European Union must act without hesitation and punish those responsible. Tonight you have a great responsibility 
to show that the Union is not a paper tiger.' 
EU leaders agreed[4] to ban Belarusian planes from flying in EU airspaces or using EU airports. They also called 
for the release of Protasevich and Sapega as well as an investigation by the International Civil Aviation 
Organization. They also agreed targeted economic sanctions and to add to the list of people subject to sanctions. 
What the European Parliament has called for regarding Belarus 
Parliament's foreign affairs committee discussed the events in Belarus on 26 May with opposition leader Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya[5]. She told MEPs: "I call on the European Parliament to ensure that the reaction of the 
international community is not limited to the Ryanair flight incident. The response must address the situation in 
Belarus in its entirety." 
Parliament has regularly called for fair elections in Belarus as well as for respect for human rights and the rule of 
law. 
Last year alone, MEPs called for: 
 New and fair presidential election in Belarus[6]Stronger sanctions against regime officials involved in human rights 
abuses[7]Support for the people of Belarus[8]A comprehensive review of EU relations with the country[9] 
 In 2020, MEPs awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to the democratic opposition in Belarus[10].

 The European Union will block Belarus' national airline and top aviation officials from entering its territories prior to 
imposing economic sanctions after it forced a Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) flight to make an emergency landing in 
Minsk on May 23, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing three diplomats.
The bloc's ambassadors could pre-approve banning Belarus airlines' overflights and landing in the EU as early as 
Friday, with formal approval later in June, the diplomats said.
Meanwhile, the sanctions are expected to cover bond sales, as well as the oil and potash industries - sectors that 
play a vital role in the Belarus economy.

 Germany has suspended incoming flights from Russian airlines in tit-for-tat move.Germany is suspending incoming 
flights from Russian airlines, the German Transport Ministry said on Wednesday. 
It came after Lufthansa had to cancel flights on Wednesday because they did not receive Russian permission in 
time, according to the ministry. 
Flight tracking data showed several canceled Aeroflot flights and at least one canceled S7 flight between Moscow 
and St Petersburg and various Germany cities. . 
What did the German government say? 
"Due to the reciprocal practice, the federal aviation authority also did not issue any further permits for flights 
operated by Russian airlines as long as authorizations are pending on the Russian side," the German Transport 
Ministry told AFP news agency. 
In a statement to Russian news agency Interfax, it said: "The Federal Ministry of Transport and the German 
embassy are in close contact with Russian agencies regulating aviation. As soon as the Russian Federal Air 
Transport Agency gives permission for Lufthansa flights, Russian aircraft will be allowed to fly," the spokeswoman 
said. 
According to the ministry, three Aeroflot flights were affected by the cancellations on Tuesday and four were 
affected on Wednesday. 
Russia suspended bilateral agreements on airline traffic in March 2020, with flights approved on a monthly charter 
basis and reciprocally. 
Lufthansa apologized for the cancellation of flights although it expected "a timely approval" for other flights in June, 
the airline told AFP. This could include a flight from Frankfurt am Main to Moscow on Wednesday evening, 
according to Lufthansa. 
What led to this situation? 
The canceling of flights comes after tensions flared over the actions of Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko 
on May 23. A Ryanair plane headed to Lithuania from Greece was forced to land over Belarusian airspace and a 
blogger critical of his regime was arrested. 
The plane was grounded with the pretext of a bomb threat aboard, although later no such device was found. EU 
governments described the incident as state piracy and stopped planes from flying over Belarusian airspace, 
angering Russia. 
New sanctions could now be imposed on Belarus aimed at hurting its economy and pushing for regime change. 
Germany suspends incoming flights from Russian airlines
Lukashenko met with Russian president Vladimir Putin on June 28 to ask for more support during the proposed EU 
sanctions on exports.

 Airline companies said flights between Germany and Russia had resumed Wednesday evening, after each country 
blocked the other's incoming flights as part of the fall-out from tensions over Belarus. 
 German airline Lufthansa told AFP that the Russian authorities had finally granted it clearance for passenger flights 
to Russia in June. 
 'That means Lufthansa flights to Moscow and Saint Petersburg can be operated as planned,' said a spokeswoman 
for the airline. 
 In Russia, Mikhail Poluboyarinov, chief executive of Aeroflot told the TASS news agency: 'Everything is fine, we 
have received all the authorisations.' 
 And another Russian airline, S7, said it too had received clearance for its flights to Germany, the Ria Novosti 
agency reported. 
 Earlier Wednesday, Germany's transport ministry said it had blocked flights operated by Russian airlines from 
arriving in its territory after Moscow failed to provide authorisations for Lufthansa. 
 Two Russia-bound Lufthansa flights due to depart earlier Wednesday from Germany had been cancelled because 
Russian authorities did not provide the necessary permits for them in time, the ministry said. 
 'Due to the reciprocal practice, the Federal Aviation Authority also did not issue any further permits for flights 
operated by Russian airlines as long as authorisations are pending on the Russian side,' it added. 
 Three Aeroflot flights were affected by the cancellations on Tuesday and another four on Wednesday, the ministry 
said. 
 'Once permits for Lufthansa flights are granted by the Russian site, the flights of Russian airlines will also be 
authorised,' it added. 
- Previous cancellations - 
Neither the ministry nor the airlines concerned mentioned the reason for the flights being blocked. 
 But some flights operated by European airlines including Air France and Austrian Airlines — a subsidiary of 
Lufthansa — were cancelled last week after Moscow rejected flight plans that would have skipped Belarusian 
airspace. 
Germany-Russia flights resume after tit-for-tat cancellations
 Lufthansa has confirmed that it is no longer flying over Belarus after the EU urged airlines to avoid the country's 
airspace. 
 The EU's advice came after the Belarusian regime forced the diversion of a Ryanair Athens-Vilnius plane to Minsk 
in order to arrest an opposition journalist on board. 
 Moscow last week said the cancellation of several European flights to Moscow was down to 'technical reasons'. 
 Eurocontrol, which coordinates air traffic control in the EU, said flights between Europe and Russia 'have 
permission to use defined air corridors. 
 'If one company changes these routes, there has to be prior agreement between the company concerned and 
Russia.'

 A Belarusian activist was taken to hospital following a court appearance in Minsk. A video appeared to show 
Stsiapan Latypau collapsing after stabbing himself with what appeared to be a pen.A Belarusian activist on 
Tuesday reportedly stabbed himself in the neck during a court appearance in the capital, Minsk. 
The dramatic courtroom scene comes as the government of Belarus faces increasing pressure over the harsh 
crackdown on anti-government demonstrations that erupted last year. 
What happened? 
A video appeared to show Stsiapan Latypau, named as well in media reports as Stepan Latypov under a different 
spelling, collapsing after using what looked like a pen as a weapon as he appeared before judges on charges of 
resisting arrest and staging actions that violate public order. 
The 41-year-old is currently being treated in hospital. The Belarusian Health Ministry said that he is conscious and 
in "stable condition." 
Viasna, an independent rights group monitoring the trial of Latypau, said it believed the activist harmed himself due 
to pressure he underwent in detention. 
The dramatic scene came after Latypau's father appeared as a witness in court. 
Following the questioning, Latypau addressed his father — saying that investigators threatened to open cases 
against his relatives if he did not admit his guilt, according to Viasna. 
He then stabbed himself in the neck with an object that appeared to be a pen. 
"Stsiapan turned blue and lay down on the bench, an ambulance was called," Viasna reported. 
Why was he on trial? 
Latypau was detained in September last year during widespread protests that erupted following disputed 
presidential elections that saw longtime leader Alexander Lukashenko claim a sixth term. 
Tuesday marked the start of Latypau's trial. He faces several charges — including resisting law enforcement that 
could amount to up to 10 years in prison. 
Viasna and other rights groups declared him a political prisoner and have been monitoring the legal proceedings 
against him. 
Crackdown on protesters 
Belarus activist reportedly stabs himself in court
Some 35,000 people — including protesters, opposition figures and journalists — have been arrested by security 
forces in Belarus in a crackdown on the demonstrations. 
Those in detention describe brutal conditions. DW reporter Alexander Burakov was released on Tuesday after 
spending 20 days in detention in Belarus. He described the treatment as "cruel and violent."  
Lukashenko's government has come under increasing pressure following the forced diversion of a Ryanair 
passenger plane in late May and the arrest of dissident blogger Raman Pratasevich.

 Stepan Latypov, 41, was filmed trying to cut his own throat with a pen in court on Tuesday. Latypov was arrested in 
a crackdown on dissent by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko's regime. It comes days after Belarus forced a 
Ryanair flight to land in order to arrest another opposition figure. See more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
A Belarusian prisoner detained in protests against President Alexander Lukashenko's[2] disputed reelection was 
filmed stabbing himself in court on Tuesday after saying he was tortured and threatened by the police.  
According to Viasna[3], a human rights organization, 41-year-old Stepan Latypov said he had been tortured in a jail 
cell for 51 days, and that police told him that his family and neighbors would face prosecution if he did not plead 
guilty to the charges against him.  
Latypov then proceeded to stab himself with an object that appeared to be a pen.  
A friend of Latypov, named Irina, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that he "took something white in his teeth, 
and started literally to cut his throat. Everyone started screaming. Police officers could not open the defendant's 
cage for awhile. He fell unconscious. We were taken out of the courtroom," according to Reuters[4].  
Viasna and other local media report that Latypov is still alive, Reuters reports. Belarus' Health Ministry said that a 
41-year-old man who stabbed himself in a courtroom is in stable condition after being treated under anaesthetic, 
according to Reuters.  
Latypov was arrested in September while trying to stop state workers from trying to paint over an opposition mural 
in his apartment's courtyard, according to Reuters and The New York Times[5]. He faces charges of organizing 
riots, resisting police, and fraud, according to Reuters.  
There was widespread unrest in Belarus in August and September, when President Lukashenko won reelection by 
an overwhelming margin - a result the European Union dismissed as fraudulent.  
He is one of 454 political prisoners currently behind held by the country's law enforcement, according to a list 
published by Viasna.  
Latypov's apparent suicide attempt comes just days after Belarus forced a Ryanair flight traveling from Greece to 
Lithuania to land, in order to arrest another opposition figure, Roman Protasevich[6]. The EU has responded to that 
incident by banning Belarusian planes[7] from its airspace and establishing a no-fly zone over the country.

Belarusians have been fleeing the country since the disputed presidential election last summer, but on Tuesday,the 
country made it hard for those remaining to leave.[8] Now, only those with permanent residencies in other countries 
will be allowed to leave, according to The Times. Read the original article on Business Insider[9]

 A Belarusian activist was taken to hospital following a court appearance in Minsk. A video appeared to show 
Stsiapan Latypau collapsing after stabbing himself with what appeared to be a pen.A Belarusian activist on 
Tuesday reportedly stabbed himself in the neck during a court appearance in the capital, Minsk. 
The dramatic courtroom scene comes as the government of Belarus faces increasing pressure over the harsh 
crackdown on anti-government demonstrations that erupted last year. 
What happened? 
A video appeared to show Stsiapan Latypau, named as well in media reports as Stepan Latypov under a different 
spelling, collapsing after using what looked like a pen as a weapon as he appeared before judges on charges of 
resisting arrest and staging actions that violate public order. 
The 41-year-old is currently being treated in hospital. The Belarusian Health Ministry said that he is conscious and 
in "stable condition." 
Viasna, an independent rights group monitoring the trial of Latypau, said it believed the activist harmed himself due 
to pressure he underwent in detention. 
The dramatic scene came after Latypau's father appeared as a witness in court. 
Following the questioning, Latypau addressed his father — saying that investigators threatened to open cases 
against his relatives if he did not admit his guilt, according to Viasna. 
He then stabbed himself in the neck with an object that appeared to be a pen. 
"Stsiapan turned blue and lay down on the bench, an ambulance was called," Viasna reported. 
Why was he on trial? 
Latypau was detained in September last year during widespread protests that erupted following disputed 
presidential elections that saw longtime leader Alexander Lukashenko claim a sixth term. 
Tuesday marked the start of Latypau's trial. He faces several charges — including resisting law enforcement that 
could amount to up to 10 years in prison. 
Viasna and other rights groups declared him a political prisoner and have been monitoring the legal proceedings 
against him. 
Crackdown on protesters 
Belarus activist reportedly stabs himself in court
Some 35,000 people — including protesters, opposition figures and journalists — have been arrested by security 
forces in Belarus in a crackdown on the demonstrations. 
Those in detention describe brutal conditions. DW reporter Alexander Burakov was released on Tuesday after 
spending 20 days in detention in Belarus. He described the treatment as "cruel and violent."  
Lukashenko's government has come under increasing pressure following the forced diversion of a Ryanair 
passenger plane in late May and the arrest of dissident blogger Raman Pratasevich.

US to suspend bilateral air services agreement with Belarus

The United States intends to suspend its 2019 bilateral air services agreement with Belarus, dealing another blow 
to the country's already embattled aviation industry. In a statement issued on May 28, 2021, the White House said 
the Biden administration would ramp up pressure on the autocratic regime of President Aleksandr Lukashenko in 
response to what it termed the continuing repression of pro-democracy protests as well as the forced diversion of 
Ryanair's B737-800 on May 23 and the ensuing arrest of journalist Raman Protasevich who was onboard. White 
House press secretary Jen Psaki said the US would also seek to sanction Belarusian companies and individuals 
both unilaterally and in coordination with partners from the European Union. 
"We take these measures, together with our partners and Allies, to hold the regime accountable for its actions and 
to demonstrate our commitment to the aspirations of the people of Belarus," she commented. The 2019 bilateral air 
services agreement between the US and Belarus removed all restrictions on the number of flights and routings 
between the two countries. However, only US and Belarus carriers are authorised to exercise these rights. The 
Belarus government had planned to develop Minsk National into a fifth-freedom hub and has reportedly been 
talking to the likes of AZAL Azerbaijan Airlines, Qatar Airways, and Uzbekistan Airways about launching flights from 
their respective hubs via the Belarus capital to the US. However, with this latest round of sanctions, these plans are 
now on hold. Other than Russia, flag carrier Belavia (B2, Minsk National) has now been banned from overflying all 
of Belarus's neighbours.

Ryanair fleet is 85% unencumbered

As Ryanair awaits delivery of the first of 210 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft later this month, the Irish low-cost carrier is 
well positioned in terms of the flexibility of its current fleet.
Ryanair has noted that more than 85% of its aircraft fleet is unencumbered. This represents approximately 
(EURO)7.3 billion ($9.18 billion) in book value.
In addition Ryanair held total liquidity of (EURO)3.2 billion after the financial year ended 31 March.
Its debt was (EURO)5.43 billion at the end of the March.
Ryanair, which is rated BBB by both S&P and Fitch Ratings, has two main debt repayments scheduled over the 
next nine months.
Its June 2014 bond issuance of (EURO)850 million matures on 17 June, according to Airfinance Journal's Deal 
Tracker. The bond has a 1.875% fixed coupon.
Ryanair's £600 million borrowing under the UK CCFF matures on 22 May 2022, according to Deal Tracker.
Last month it issued a (EURO)1.2 billion unsecured bond under its (EURO)5 billion Euro medium-term note 
programme (EMTN). The bond has a five-year tenor and a fixed coupon of 0.875%.
It followed another (EURO)850 million bond, at a fixed coupon of 2.875%, in September last year.
The carrier also has an (EURO)850 million 1.125% senior unsecured bond maturing on 10 March 2023. Its 2017 
6.5-year bond worth (EURO)750 million, at a fixed coupon of 1.125%, matures on 15 August 2023.
Ryanair plans to take delivery of its first Boeing 737-8200 this month. By summer 2022, the carrier will operate 60 
aircraft of the type.
According to Airfinance Journal's fleet Tracker, Ryanair's fleet includes 318 737-800s.
Ryanair fleet is 85% unencumbered
To accommodate the new 737-8200, Ryanair plans to sell older aircraft and return maturing leases.   Easyjet 
finished the first half of its 2021 fiscal year (31 March 2021) with 134 aircraft unencumbered, or 40% of its Airbus 
narrowbody fleet. This was down from 48% at 30 September 2020.
The UK carrier expects no new deliveries until 30 September 2021 and will end up with a fleet of 307-310 aircraft. In 
the 2022 financial year the carrier plans to take delivery of eight aircraft, followed by seven in the 2023 financial 
year and 18 in financial year 2024.
At 30 March 2021, Easyjet's debt was (EURO)3.32 billion. Cash and money market deposits totalled (EURO)2.33 
billion.
The carrier's unsecured bond programme will see its first repayments in February and October 2023, when a total 
of (EURO)1 billion is due.

Ryanair Group anticipates the delivery of 11 additional Boeing 737 Max 8200 aircraft during the summer 2021 
season, after receiving its first aircraft of the type on 16 June.
Six units will be delivered to Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair while another six will be handed over to its subsidiary 
Malta Air, Ryanair says in a statement.
After some delay in Ryanair's initial 737 Max delivery schedule following the recertification of the aircraft in Europe 
in January, the group now aims to accelerate 737 Max deliveries with 50 units expected to be received before next 
summer.
"We are delighted to take delivery of our first new technology Gamechanger aircraft. These new Boeing 737 aircraft 
will help Ryanair lower costs, cut fuel consumption and lower noise and CO2 emissions as we invest heavily in new 
technology to deepen our environmental commitment," comments Ryanair's chief executive officer, Michael 
O'Leary.
Ryanair Group has firm orders for 210 aircraft of the type, having increased its orderbook from 135 737 Max units in 
December last year.
Each of Ryanair's 737-8200s is configured with 197 seats, compared with a 189-seat layout for its current 737NG 
fleet.
The 737-8200 will carry 4% more passengers but reduce fuel burn by 16% per seat, lower noise emissions by 40% 
and lower CO2 emissions by a similar amount, says Ryanair.

EU court rules against Condor state aid
EU court rules against Condor state aid

A European Union (EU) court has annulled the European Commission's (EC) approval of a (EURO)550 million 
($670 million) state aid package for German leisure airline Condor Flugdienst.
In a challenge brought by Ryanair, the EU general court ruled that the EC provided an "inadequate statement of 
reasons" for issuing the aid measures to Condor.
The court found there was an insufficient link between the aid measure provided for damages suffered due to flight 
cancellations resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic and the EC's decision to add costs associated with the 
extension of Condor's insolvency proceedings to the damages claimed in the package.
The court noted there is "nothing in the contested decision to indicate that the sale of Condor failed because of the 
cancellation and rescheduling of those flights", adding: "The Commission failed to explain how the additional costs 
arising from the extension of the insolvency proceedings were assessed or what type of costs were involved".
The ruling echoed decisions made last month in which the court annulled EU approval of (EURO)3.4 billion in state 
aid for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and (EURO)1.2 billion for TAP Air Portugal.
In all three cases, the other two also brought by Ryanair, the rulings have been suspended pending new EU 
decisions with a more complete reasoning for the provision of the aid packages.
Condor filed for insolvency in September 2019 after its parent company Thomas Cook Group entered liquidation.
The airline also benefitted from a (EURO)380 million six-month state bridging loan, approved by the EC, following 
the Thomas Cook Group liquidation.
Condor's insolvency proceedings were extended in April last year when prospective investor Polish Aviation Group, 
parent company of LOT Polish Airlines, withdrew its purchase offer.
The German carrier has subsequently been acquired by investment fund Attestor, which will bring in (EURO)200 
million in fresh capital and provide (EURO)250 million of investment for fleet renewal in exchange for a 51% stake 
in the airline.
EU court rules against Condor state aid
The (EURO)550 million loan will now be restructured as part of the Attestor deal, Condor said in a statement last 
month.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) on Tuesday urged the UK government to resume international travel from all 
European Union countries for vaccinated people, when reviewing the lists on its traffic light system on Thursday.
The budget airline called on UK Minister for Transport Grant Shapps to remove travel restrictions for fully 
vaccinated passengers, as well as scrapping the "nonsensical" need of a negative PCR test for tourists returning 
from countries in the green list. 
Shares in the Irish air carrier were marginally higher on Tuesday afternoon.

 The ministers will review a communique being drafted for the June 14 summit in Brussels, taking place amid the 
withdrawal from Afghanistan and continued tension with Russia.The NATO allies' defense and foreign ministers are 
meeting on Tuesday to prepare for the June 14 summit, which US President Joe Biden will attend. 
On the ministers' agenda are the latest developments in Ukraine and Belarus as well as NATO's future ties with 
Russia. 
The ministers are also expected to discuss the alliance's role in Afghanistan as it withdraws NATO troops. 
The way forward in Afghanistan 
As NATO withdraws troops from Afghanistan after two decades, allies have been considering the future of their ties 
with Kabul. 
The UK announced that it would accelerate the relocation of its Afghan staff who worked with the military, often as 
interpreters, ahead of the planned withdrawal. Germany had also made a similar announcement. 
Biden had said that the US would pull out its troops from Afghanistan by September 11. NATO troops are expected 
to leave by that date if they have not already. 
Critics have raised concerns over the decision, fearing it could lead to the Taliban taking over the more urban parts 
of the country which it does not control. 
Tensions with Belarus 
NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced on Monday that the alliance would restrict access to its 
headquarters in Brussels for Belarusian officials. 
Stoltenberg's announcement came in the wake of the forced Ryanair flight diversion that sparked international 
outrage. 
In a joint statement last week, NATO's 30 member states condemned Belarus' move and called for the immediate 
release of Raman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega, who were arrested aboard the Ryanair flight. 
"We have also clearly stated that we welcome the decision by many NATO allies to impose sanctions, including 
restricting the access of the Belarussian airliner to their airspace," Stoltenberg said. 
NATO mulls response to Russia 
Russia is high on the June summit agenda as relations between NATO allies and Moscow have hit a new low. 
The Kremlin announced Monday that Russia would deploy an additional 20 military units in the country's western 
border areas by the end of the year. 
NATO ministers meet to lay groundwork for summit
"What we see is a pattern of Russian behavior where Russia over the last years has invested heavily in new 
modern military capabilities from conventional to nuclear weapon systems," Stoltenberg told reporters on Monday. 
"Not only that but that Russia has been willing to use military force against neighbors in Georgia and Ukraine, 
continuing to destabilize Donbas and eastern Ukraine and illegally annexing Crimea." 
NATO allies repeatedly raised concerns over tensions between Russia and Ukraine. The Kremlin had recently 
ordered troops back from the border with Ukraine, after a military buildup. 
Ukraine keen on German military gear 
Meanwhile, Ukraine's president enthusiastically picked up on a suggestion from a leading German Green politician 
made recently during a visit to Kyiv. Green party co-chair Robert Habeck had suggested that Germany could sell 
military equipment to Ukraine.  
"Germany has not given us any military aid, but it could do that," Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the 
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper's Tuesday edition. "Habeck understood that."  
Habeck, who had called for supplying Ukraine with "defensive weapons," later clarified that he had meant "night 
vision devices, reconnaissance devices, ordinance disposal" and vehicles for medical evacuation. 
 Firsts for Biden 
Biden, who will be attending his first NATO summit as president, will also meet Russia's President Vladimir Putin 
two days after in Geneva. 
Russia's deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said the US should expect an array of "uncomfortable" signals in 
the coming days and ahead of the anticipated first meeting between the two leaders. 
US relations with NATO were strained under Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, with Biden making clear before 
and after his election that he intended to change this.

 An expert's point of view on a current event. 
 June 1, 2021, 4:42 PM  
 On May 23, a Ryanair flight passing through Belarusian airspace from Athens to Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, 
was forced down in Minsk by a fraudulent bomb threat—backed up by a MiG-29 fighter jet escort. The falsified 
bomb threat was concocted by the Belarusian government for the purpose of apprehending exiled Belarusian 
opposition journalist Roman Protasevich. He had taken a flight that intersected Belarusian airspace on his return to 
Lithuania. 
 The 26 year old Protasevich, now held by the Belarusian KGB and tortured into making a TV confession, was a 
pivotal figure in developing and leading the NEXTA Telegram channel, which had been reporting on opposition 
protests that wracked Belarus in the wake of falsified presidential elections held in August 2020. But the strategies 
the Belarus democratic opposition had deployed for nine months produced a dispirited and exhausted stalemate. 
Ironically, the crudeness of Minsk's actions—prompted by a personal vendetta by Belarusian dictator Aleksandr 
Lukashenko against the young journalist—represents an opportunity to revitalize the Belarusian opposition even as 
repression is steadily escalating. 
 This revitalization comes amid heart-rending tragedy. Last week, the touching suicide note of a teenage student 
protester who had been harassed by the authorities went viral. Earlier today, a political prisoner named Stepan 
Latypov cut his own throat in the middle of his hearing in a Belarus courtroom. 
 Part of this stems from the new limits on Belarusian citizens, increasingly stuck inside their own borders. There are 
now reports[1] that only those with foreign residence permits are being allowed out—but even those with passports 
to elsewhere are finding it hard to travel there. The European Union has called for the closure of Belarusian 
airspace while its land borders are increasingly sealed. Ukraine has followed suit and closed its flights from Minsk. 
 A day before the Ryanair flight was forced down, I sat with Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya 
in a conference room at the democratic opposition offices in Vilnius. Tsikhanouskaya had clearly grown more 
comfortable in her role as head of the political opposition, which the former teacher assumed after Lukashenko 
imprisoned her husband and allowed her to run against him in elections as a placeholder candidate. 
Lukashenko's Air Piracy Has Revitalized Belarus 's Opposition
 A week before we met, the authorities had shut down the popular media platform Tut.By, used by two out of every 
three Belarusians. When I asked if this ban indicated that the next phase of escalating repression had arrived, 
Tsikhanouskaya gave a chillingly prescient answer. 'Every time we think that they have reached a new low, we see 
them doing something worse to leave nothing to allow Belarusians to show the world the truth. The resistance 
continues, and they understand that they need more and more repression and escalation in order to keep going. 
Having arrested anyone that they can, they realize that they now need to undermine whole institutions and 
structures.' 
 With Moscow continuing to prop up Lukashenko, fearing the precedent of a dictator being forced out by street 
protesters, the opposition and Lukashenko were locked in a conflict of slow and methodical attrition. 
Tsikhanouskaya was stoic, but evidently—like most of the opposition members I met with—also worn out. ' We are 
tired,' she admitted. 'I am tired. We are all tired, but let those who are tired take a break and rest for a while and get 
back to resist.' 
 Avoiding exhaustion and stagnation is difficult for opposition movements, but when I asked how long Belarusians 
could tolerate security services' violence without any visible origin from the struggle, she gently corrected me, 
saying 'they are not tolerating it now.' The movement, she argued, had a very short time frame for success, but that 
needed to be balanced against the risk of further endangering protesters. 'Thousands of people are already in jail 
and ever new victims will not bring us closer to what people have been hoping for. We need to be smarter, more 
clever and possibly more patient,' she said. 
 Avoiding irrelevance in exile is difficult for any opposition movement. But in recent days, the opposition, now based 
in Warsaw and Vilnius, has begun to consciously cast itself as a national liberation movement by drawing parallels 
between the brutality of the Lukashenko security state and the former Nazi occupation of the country. Belarus 
suffered one the highest mortality rates in World War II, and partisan resistance is burnt into the popular 
imagination. 
 Tsikhanouskaya pointed out the opposition was counting on the breakdown of elite loyalty to the regime as more 
and more costs were leveraged against them. The putting off of local elections was an indicator they were afraid of 
any sort of popular mobilization. 'More and more of them inside the system are unhappy, and they are afraid that 
the local elections will simply offer another reason for the population to protest,' she said. 'They are afraid, and the 
continuous resistance has the effect of exhausting the regime. We never had the opportunity to go to the barricades 
because that would give the regime a reason to use overwhelming force.' 
 Tsikhanouskaya has spent months crisscrossing Europe to muster support for her movement. She is often greeted 
with the reverence reserved for a head of state or a heroic conscience of the nation and, I suspect, was 
understandably frustrated by the lack of follow-through to the grandiose promises of support made to the opposition 
by European politicians. But with the act of air piracy shocking the world, the new situation offers a tremendous 
opportunity to reenergize both the opposition and the willingness of Europeans to offer support. 
 'Europe did a great deal in the beginning and offered a great deal of moral support, and afterward, the question is 
how far and how quickly they could go in implementing aggressive actions against the regime,' she said. 'Since 
December [2020], that is for six months, we have had no new concrete actions on sanctions or movement on more 
civil society assistance. We call on the European Union to be braver.' 
 The expected fourth wave of targeted European sanctions against Minsk regime officials lost steam as street 
protests across Belarus shrank in the face of cold weather and continued arrests and beatings. But sanctions are 
now back in play—as is far more European aid to the opposition. There is even a push to have Tsikhanouskaya 
invited as a guest to the forthcoming G-7 meeting in June. There is now no going back to the status quo. 
Lukashenko can no longer be ignored by those European elites who may have preferred to look the other direction.

 The ministers will review a communique being drafted for the June 14 summit in Brussels, taking place amid the 
withdrawal from Afghanistan and continued tension with Russia.The NATO allies' defense and foreign ministers are 
meeting on Tuesday to prepare for the June 14 summit, which US President Joe Biden will attend. 
On the ministers' agenda are the latest developments in Ukraine and Belarus as well as NATO's future ties with 
Russia. 
The ministers are also expected to discuss the alliance's role in Afghanistan as it withdraws NATO troops. 
The way forward in Afghanistan 
As NATO withdraws troops from Afghanistan after two decades, allies have been considering the future of their ties 
with Kabul. 
The UK announced that it would accelerate the relocation of its Afghan staff who worked with the military, often as 
interpreters, ahead of the planned withdrawal. Germany had also made a similar announcement. 
Biden had said that the US would pull out its troops from Afghanistan by September 11. NATO troops are expected 
to leave by that date if they have not already. 
Critics have raised concerns over the decision, fearing it could lead to the Taliban taking over the more urban parts 
of the country which it does not control. 
Tensions with Belarus 
Stoltenberg announced on Monday that the alliance would restrict access to its headquarters in Brussels for 
Belarusian officials. 
Stoltenberg's announcement came in the wake of the forced Ryanair flight diversion that sparked international 
outrage. 
In a joint statement last week, NATO's 30 member states condemned Belarus' move and called for the immediate 
release of Raman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega, who were arrested aboard the Ryanair flight. 
"We have also clearly stated that we welcome the decision by many NATO allies to impose sanctions, including 
restricting the access of the Belarussian airliner to their airspace," Stoltenberg said. 
NATO mulls response to Russia 
Russia is high on the June summit agenda as relations between NATO allies and Moscow have hit a new low. 
The Kremlin announced Monday that Russia would deploy an additional 20 military units in the country's western 
border areas by the end of the year. 
NATO ministers meet to lay groundwork for summit
"What we see is a pattern of Russian behavior where Russia over the last years has invested heavily in new 
modern military capabilities from conventional to nuclear weapon systems," Stoltenberg told reporters on Monday. 
"Not only that but that Russia has been willing to use military force against neighbors in Georgia and Ukraine, 
continuing to destabilize Donbas and eastern Ukraine and illegally annexing Crimea." 
NATO allies repeatedly raised concerns over tensions between Russia and Ukraine. The Kremlin had recently 
ordered troops back from the border with Ukraine, after a military buildup. 
"Our message remains clear: We are prepared for dialogue, and we have made proposals, but the key to a better 
relationship lies clearly with Moscow," German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters ahead of Tuesday's 
meeting.  
Ukraine keen on German military gear 
Meanwhile, Ukraine's president enthusiastically picked up on a suggestion from a leading German Green politician 
made recently during a visit to Kyiv. Green party co-chair Robert Habeck had suggested that Germany could sell 
military equipment to Ukraine.  
"Germany has not given us any military aid, but it could do that," Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the 
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper's Tuesday edition. "Habeck understood that."  
Habeck, who had called for supplying Ukraine with "defensive weapons," later clarified that he had meant "night 
vision devices, reconnaissance devices, ordinance disposal" and vehicles for medical evacuation. 
Maas said ahead of the NATO meeting that arm deliveries to Ukraine will not help reach a political solution.  
 Firsts for Biden 
Biden, who will be attending his first NATO summit as president, will also meet Russia's President Vladimir Putin 
two days after in Geneva. 
Russia's deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said the US should expect an array of "uncomfortable" signals in 
the coming days and ahead of the anticipated first meeting between the two leaders. 
US relations with NATO were strained under Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, with Biden making clear before 
and after his election that he intended to change this.

Jun 01, 2021( The Finanser by Chris Skinner: https://thefinanser.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 I grew up as a fan-boy of all things Marvel, and have been delighted with the way the Marvel Universe has panned 
out for next generations. In particular, Spider-Man has always been a highlight, and I regularly use one of the lines 
from these comic books: With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility. 
 Attributed as a line to Peter Parker's Uncle Ben, it actually originated in the Amazing Fantasy 15 (1962), the first 
Spider-Man Marvel comic, as a caption. 
 https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Great-power.png 
 However, if you do further investigation some say it was a line introduced by Voltaire during the French Revolution, 
although I cannot find any direct evidence of this via Google. Equally, I prefer to think it was a variation of this line 
from Luke 12:48 in the Christian Bible: 
 'From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted 
with much, much more will be asked.' 
 Anyway, I diverge. Why is this important? Because it's a theme I've used often in banking and finance. Money 
creates power and with great power comes great responsibility; more than this though is that power creates wealth. 
In fact, it's a virtuous circle: the more money you have the more powerful you become and the more powerful you 
become the more money you generate. 
 It is for this reason that some of those in power can become dictators, such as Saddam Hussein of Iraq[1]. After 
the Iraq War: 
 US forces broke through a wall in a small building in Iraq in April 2003 and found a number of metal boxes, each 
containing crisp new American dollar bills. They must have thought it was their lucky day because, by the end of 
that day, they had discovered 164 of these boxes around Baghdad with a value to the tune of $650 million. It may 
have been a lot more than that, but that is how much was declared. 
 Thing is, before the war, he needed that secret stash to buy favours, pay off protesters and enemies, cover the 
costs of his personal army and police force, and ensure that the Imams followed his lead. In other words, money 
creates power and power creates more money to keep the power. 
 That is the nature of some dictatorships, and this hits home when I look at Belarus today. 
With Great Power Comes Great Wealth
 Alexander Lukashenko is purely keeping his power because all of the state forces are on his payroll. That's why he 
can bring down a Ryanair flight and no one in Belarus can do anything about it, even if the rest of the world is 
shocked. 
 https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Putin.jpg 
 In a similar way, why do you think Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin has remained in power for so long? It's over two 
decades since he first took office and he stays in power because he is popular with the oligarchs and state forces. 
He rewards them, and looks after them. In return, they protect him and do what he asks. If they don't do what he 
asks, a spot of Novichok does the trick. 
 But then we in the rest of the world may look at these leaders as bad, but are ours any better? 
 With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility. 
 When I look at Donald Trump, Boris Johnson, Nicolas Sarkozy, Benjamin Netanyahuand many other leaders, we 
can see their web of deceit. The web is funded by greed and wealth to create more and more power to create more 
and more wealth. It is the reason why politics is called politics. The term politics comes from the Latin 
polyformanyandticsas inblood-sucking parasites. 
 This reminds me of the time I heard the portrait photographer Platon[2] talking about his career and how it started 
with an unusual angle on Bill Clinton. At one United Nations Summit, he was given the privilege of photographing 
every world leader attending from Gadhafi to Berlusconi. On presenting these photographs, he noted that nearly 
every single leader was now on trial for corruption, fraud, bankruptcy or just generally on-the-run, and most of these 
leaders were men. 
 But it is changing. When we talk about great leaders of today, many of them are great women[3]. Whether it has 
been New Zealand under Jacinda Ardern or Taiwan under the presidency of Tsai Ing-Wen or Germany under 
Angela Merkel, female-led countries have been held up as good examples of how to manage a pandemic. 
 Is that because women have a different attitude towards wealth and power to men? 
 From The New York Times[4]: 
 Many women, those who grew up wealthy and those who did not, have long been steered away from the 
unapologetic drive for wealth. 
 It's bound up with the way girls are often schooled to place the needs of others above their own, to repress or deny 
outward signs of ambition. Even as women have pushed into once-male bastions in business, many still feel the 
sting of professional and personal backlash if they are perceived as too aggressive. 
 'Girls as they are growing up are not socialized to feel that it's O.K. for them to have ambition about creating 
wealth, not the way it is for little boys,' said Mariko Chang, the author of 'Shortchanged,' a study of the wealth gap 
between men and women. 'They're encouraged to take on roles that let them take care of other people'  
 From her perches both in investment banking and city government, [Alicia Glen, New York's deputy mayor for 
housing and economic development] has watched men relish the rewards money brings  
 Many women I interviewed said they viewed money as a means to help others rather than to increase their own 
profile. Those attitudes, admirable as they may be, have helped fuel a power gap that separates men and women. 
 Of course, many recoil at the idea that women should pursue money and clout just the way men do. That flies in 
the face of increasing political anger about inequality. There's a longstanding rift in the women's movement and 
beyond: Does the path to power require acting more like men, or can women wield influence in ways that are 
different but just as effective? 
 'There are men for whom there is no amount of money that is enough,' [Joline Godfrey, author of the book 'Raising 
Financially Fit Kids'] said. 'The quest of more, bigger, better has taken this planet to a place of unsustainability. It 
seems to me that women are making different choices. And those choices may be healthier for all of us.' 
 The article[5] is well worth a read, and sits on trend with all of my experiences in business, banking and tech. The 
male view of the world is greed is good, and its very difficult to untie that. The male view of the world is of an army 
of troops who you command. The male view of the world is beat all the others, no matter what cost. 
 The male view of the world is a balloon that has a massive needle hanging over it. The needle is called women. 
 The female view of the world is wealth can help. The female view of the world is to raise and nurture. The female 
view of the world is to support and counsel. The female view of the world is if we can raise one, we can raise all. 
 I'm being stereotypical and will probably get called out as some woke misogynist, but I was talking about such 
things way back in the 1990s. My first boss was a woman; because I was in marketing, where most women work in 
department that 'makes things pretty'.I worked for women most of my initial career; working for and with women 
made the environment far more fun and equitable than when I worked with most men. 
With Great Power Comes Great Wealth
 I just can't believe that it's still a thing thirty years later. But the thing is changing[6]. We now have Citi Group run by 
Jane Fraser and Stephanie Cohen a likely successor to David Solomon at Goldman Sachs; we have Alison Rose 
running NatWest and Ana Botin at Santander Group; and we mustn't forget Christine Lagarde at the ECB and the 
many other powerful women of the world[7]. 
 The trend is notable. The trend is that world leaders, prime ministers, CEOs, bank and investment focused people, 
are becoming more and more oriented towards Mother Earth and female virtues, driven by wealth to do good for 
society and the planet. That world is very different. 
 Oh, and don't think I'm saying women are taking over the world. They will be lucky if they're even considered equal 
two centuries from now.

Belarus Opposition Activist Stabs Himself in Court Hearing
Belarus Opposition Activist Stabs Himself in Court Hearing

Jun 01, 2021( Voice of America: http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 A Belarusian opposition activist stabbed himself in the throat with a pen during a court hearing in Minsk on 
Tuesday to protest what he claimed were threats from authorities to arrest his family members and friends if he did 
not plead guilty to organizing protests against the country's authoritarian ruler, President Alexander Lukashenko. 
Footage from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty showed Stsiapan Latypau lying limp on a bench in the defendant's 
cage after his self-inflicted wounding as guards tended to him. 
The video showed him being carried unconscious from the courthouse on a stretcher, his neck wrapped in a white 
cloth, and put into an ambulance. 
The Viasna human rights center in Belarus said Latypau was put into an induced coma. His lawyer declined to 
comment on his condition. 
Before he stabbed himself, Latypau climbed on the bench in the cage and claimed investigators had told him, 'If I 
don't plead guilty, they will open criminal cases against my family and neighbors.' 
Latypau has been held since September 2020 on various charges, including accusations that he staged actions 
violating the public order in last summer's vast protests against Lukashenko. The street demonstrations occurred 
after the strongman claimed a sixth presidential election victory with 80% of the vote. 
If convicted, Latypau faces up to 10 years in prison. 
Latypau's apparent attempted suicide is the latest incident with links to protests against Lukashenko. Last week, an 
opposition politician died in prison under unclear circumstances, while a teenager under investigation for protesting 
committed suicide by throwing himself from a 16-story building. 
'This is the result of state terror, repressions, torture in Belarus,' wrote Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya, an opposition 
leader. 'We must stop it immediately!' 
Belarus Opposition Activist Stabs Himself in Court Hearing
Many governments, except Russia, a close ally of Belarus, condemned Lukashenko last month after he diverted a 
Ryanair jetliner flying over Belarus and carrying Raman Pratasevich, a Belarusian activist who had fled the country 
in 2019 and had since lived in exile. 
Pratasevich and his companion, Sofia Sapega, were arrested when the flight landed in Minsk on the purported 
claim of a bomb aboard the aircraft, although no explosive was found. 
In response, European countries stopped flying over Belarus, depriving Minsk of overflight revenue, and blocked 
flights by Belavia, the Belarusian state air carrier, from landing in European cities. 
Lukashenko met with Russian President Vladimir Putin late last week to shore up support with his government's key 
foreign ally. On Tuesday, Lukashenko announced Belarus would soon open direct flights with Crimea, the Ukrainian 
peninsula Russia annexed in 2014, although Western governments do not recognize Moscow's claim to the 
territory.

 Belarus is temporarily preventing most of its citizens from leaving the country amid crackdowns against critics of 
President Alexander Lukashenko. 
In a statement on Telegram seen by the BBC[1], the State Border Committee said only some government workers 
and citizens with permanent residency in other countries will be allowed to leave. 
The agency blamed the COVID-19 for the travel ban, but it comes only weeks after 26-year old journalist Roman 
Protasevich[2], a staunch critic of Lukashenko's, was arrested when his Ryanair flight was diverted. Several other 
critics have also been detained BBC reported.

A Ryanair flight travelling from the Republic of Ireland to Poland diverted to Germany due to a potential security 
threat, the airline has confirmed.
Flight FR1901 departed from Dublin just before 17:00 local time on Sunday.During the flight, German air traffic 
control notified the crew of a "potential security threat on board," a Ryanair spokesman told BBC News NI.The 
captain diverted to the nearest airport, Berlin, where passengers disembarked for security checks."Once cleared by 
German authorities, passengers travelled onwards to Krakow on a spare Ryanair aircraft after a delay on the 
ground of approximately seven hours," the airline's spokesman added."Ryanair apologises sincerely to all affected 
passengers for this unavoidable delay, which was outside the airline's control."
The German newspaper Bild Zeitung reported the flight made an emergency landing at Berlin Brandenburg Airport 
due to a "bomb threat".Quoting an airport spokesman, the paper said all 160 passengers had to get out of the plane 
while German police searched for a suspicious item on board.Nothing was found during the operation.The diversion 
came a week after another Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania was forced to land in Belarus under military 
escort.Belarus authorities said they had received a bomb threat about the aircraft, but when the plane landed in 
Minsk, Belarusian dissident journalist Roman Protasevich and his Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega were both 
arrested.The European Union leaders issued a joint statement condemning the arrests and calling on all EU-based 
airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace. www.bbc.com

 A Ryanair passenger plane made an emergency landing in Berlin before resuming its journey to Poland, German 
police said late Sunday without releasing further details. 
The flight from Dublin to Krakow made the unexpected diversion after a reported bomb threat, German newspaper 
Bild Zeitung said. 
With 160 people on board, the flight arrived at the Berlin-Brandenburg airport shortly after 8 pm (1800 GMT) 
Sunday, remaining on the tarmac into early Monday morning. 
A Berlin police spokesperson said that officers had completed their security checks "without any danger being 
detected". 
"The passengers will resume their journey to Poland on board a spare aeroplane," she told AFP, without giving 
more precise details for the alert.

The flight was emptied with the baggage also searched, German media reported. 
"The Ryanair plane that made an emergency landed reported an air emergency and was therefore immediately 
given a landing permit at BER," airport spokesman Jan-Peter Haack told Bild. 
 "The aircraft is currently in a safe position," a spokeswoman for the police told the newspaper. 
The incident comes a week after a Ryanair flight was forced to divert to Belarus, with a passenger -- a dissident 
journalist -- arrested on arrival. 
And in July last year, another Ryanair plane from Dublin to Krakow was forced to make an emergency landing in 
London after a false bomb threat.

Delayed for two months due to COVID-19 restrictions, Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) next month reopens its base 
at Venice Treviso following the airport's scheduled reopening on June 1, 2021. The Irish budget carrier initially 
planned to reopen its base in Treviso on March 30, 2021, but this was postponed as the airport was forced to close 
following renewed lockdown restrictions imposed in Italy from March 15. Treviso Airport, mainly used by low-cost 
carriers, is located about 31km away from Venice. Ryanair will station two Malta Air (AL, Malta Int'l) B737-800s in 
Treviso, making it the airline's 15th base in Italy, the airline announced earlier. This summer, it plans to connect the 
airport to 48 destinations, including 43 international and five domestic ones. This would include the following new 
destinations:
From June:
1x weekly to Kerkyra (Greece);
2x weekly to Oslo Gardermoen (Norway);
4x weekly to Bristol Int'l (UK);
2x weekly to Chania (Greece);
2x weekly to Riga (Latvia);
2x weekly to Trapani (Italy);
2x weekly to Alicante and Palma de Mallorca (Spain);
2x weekly to Suceava (Romania).
From July:
2x weekly to Rhodes (Greece);
2x weekly to Sibiu (Romania).
Ryanair reopens base at Treviso after Covid delay
The new base and capacity in Treviso mean Ryanair will offer 65 routes in total from Treviso, Verona, and Venice 
Marco Polo, the three airports serving the Veneto north-eastern Italian region. During the closure of Treviso, more 
of the carrier's services operated out of Venice Marco Polo temporarily.

German police examined a Ryanair passenger jet on the tarmac at Berlin Airport for several hours late on Sunday 
after an unscheduled landing, police confirmed.
Why the plane en route from Dublin to Cracow stopped in Berlin around 8 pm (1800 GMT) was not immediately 
disclosed for operational reasons, a police spokesperson said.
The aircraft was taken to a parking spot away from the terminal. The 160 passengers were taken inside.
The jet was surrounded by numerous police vehicles with flashing lights.
Police aided by sniffer dogs examined the passengers' luggage assembled near the plane. The luggage was taken 
inside the terminal building later.
The police search operation went on into the early hours of Monday with no end in sight.
It was unclear if and when the plane would be allowed to resume its journey.
Airport authorities lifted the night flight ban for the Ryanair flight as a precaution.
The Berlin tabloids B.Z. and Bild had first reported on the incident and mentioned a potential bomb scare.
Last summer, a Ryanair plane had to make a safety landing on its way from Dublin to Krakow because of an 
anonymous bomb threat. Irish media reported that nothing was found during the search in London Stansted.
Sunday's incident in Berlin comes a week after Belarusian authorities dispatched a fighter jet to force another 
Ryanair flight to divert to Minsk, where a dissident journalist who was on board was then arrested.

A Ryanair plane made an unscheduled landing in Berlin due to information received about a possible security threat 
on board, the Irish airline said on Monday.
The flight from the Irish capital Dublin to Krakow in Poland was diverted to the German capital around 8 pm (1800 
GMT) on Sunday because that was the closest airport, the company said.
The Boeing 737-800 was met by a group of police vehicles with lights flashing as it parked in a spot away from the 
main terminal.
The 165 passengers and their luggage were taken off the plane and examined with the help of sniffer dogs, in an 
operation that lasted until 4 am.
After eight hours, passengers then continued on with their journey using a replacement aircraft.
German federal police said on Monday morning they had determined there was no danger to the aircraft but have 
yet to release details on the purported threat, saying only that it was a telephone call that had raised alarm.
German tabloids Bild and BZ said that there had been a bomb threat, but neither the police nor Ryanair confirmed 
those reports.
Sunday's incident in Berlin comes a week after Belarusian authorities dispatched a fighter jet to force another 
Ryanair flight to divert to Minsk, where a dissident journalist who was on board was then arrested along with his 
girlfriend.

ETF Airways (EZZ, Zagreb) received its Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) from the Croatian Civil Aviation Agency 
(CCAA) on May 28, 2021, and took delivery of its first B737-800 ahead of what it hopes to be a busy summer 
season. 9A-LAB (msn 30882), a 20.4-year-old aircraft owned by AerCap and formerly operated by ASL Airlines 
France, was ferried after maintenance from Belgrade to Pula on May 22. On May 28, the airline flew the Boeing 
narrowbody to Zadar and Zagreb before returning to Pula, Flightradar24 ADS-B data shows. The start-up expects 
the delivery of its second B737, due to be 9A-ABC (msn 30667), in early June 2021. The 17.4-year-old aircraft will 
also be dry-leased from AerCap. 
A third B737 is under negotiations for potential delivery in 2022. ETF Airways will initially focus on the ACMI/charter 
market outside Croatia. It hopes to see demand for leisure flights rebound quickly once vaccinations and 
coordinated bureaucracy allow European countries to abolish restrictions for intra-bloc travel. "The market is 
recovering quickly after the spring easing of the pandemic. The demand for our services outside Croatia is growing 
above our expectations," Chief Executive Stjepan Bedic claimed during a presentation of the aircraft at Pula airport. 
The airline does not plan to avoid operating to and from Croatia completely and will also seek opportunities in its 
home market. However, it will not engage in head-to-head rivalry with low-cost carriers, including Ryanair, which 
has a strong presence in Croatia. "The world is big, but we are primarily a Croatian company. Understandably, the 
pandemic and focus on vehicle-driving tourists have hindered investments in the development of air links with more 
remote tourist-generating markets such as Northern Europe, Russia or Israel. I am certain that, in the coming years, 
we'll be opening new markets and generating new values together, thus contributing to Croatian tourism's 
evolution," deputy chairman and investor Velimir Sonje said.

Low-cost airlines hit by rise in price of carbon credits

A sharp rise in the cost of polluting in Europe risks undermining airlines' efforts to repair balance sheets following 
the damage caused by Covid-19.
The cost of purchasing carbon allowances under the EU's emissions trading system, ETS, has been on a 
recordbreaking rally, with prices more than doubling compared with pre-pandemic levels to more than (EURO)50 a 
tonne.
That presents a problem for airlines in the region, which must buy the tradable credits to cover the amount they 
pollute under parallel emissions systems in both the UK and the EU.
The nascent UK system, which launched this month, started trading at higher prices of more than £50 a tonne.
Low-cost carriers, including Ryanair, easyJet and Wizz Air, have been hit particularly hard as the schemes only 
cover emissions on flights in Europe and the UK, where they do nearly all their flying.
"There's no getting away from the fact that the carbon price is going through the roof and these guys are exposed to 
that," said Deutsche Bank analyst Jaime Rowbotham.
Disclosure around emissions trading and hedging strategies are patchy, but Rowbotham estimates Ryanair, 
easyJet and Wizz will between them pay more than (EURO)600m in carbon costs in their 2023 financial years, up 
from about (EURO)330m before the crisis hit.
Low-cost airlines hit by rise in price of carbon credits
Airlines are given an annual set of free credits, and must purchase the remainder to cover the rest of their 
emissions.
Airlines have carried so few passengers during the pandemic that some free credits remain unused.
The problem is likely to persist as traders and market participants expect the price of carbon to keep rising as net 
zero pledges of governments and corporates become more ambitious. It has prompted several airlines to begin 
hedging credits in the same way as they do jet fuel in an effort to lock in lower prices.
Both the EU and UK are planning to reduce the total number of allowances in their trading schemes as well as the 
number given out for free over the next decade, which is expected to push the price of credits up further.
Airlines will eventually want to pass these rising costs on to passengers, but this will be hard as they aim to 
stimulate demand by lowering prices, said Alexander Paterson, an analyst at Peel Hunt.

Hybrid working is creating a "culture crisis" for companies by eroding staff loyalty and making it harder to retain 
talented employees as well as detect fraud, auditors have warned.
Almost half of senior auditors believe the shift to remote working during the pandemic has damaged organisational 
culture, according to research by the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors.
The poll of more than 700 senior auditors across the UK and Europe "highlights a rising post-pandemic 
organisational culture crisis, which has the potential to trigger a chain of negative impacts across wider business 
structures", the CIIA said.
"Most businesses are focusing on ironing out issues of the hybrid working model from technical and practical 
perspectives. What is not dissected enough is how new working models can potentially erode organisational 
culture," said Heli Mooney, head of internal audit at Ryanair.
"Dilution of a strong organisational culture can trigger a myriad of ... risks, not least on talent management and 
fraud," she added.
Many companies - including tech groups Google and Microsoft, accountants EY, KPMG and PwC and law firms 
Clifford Chance and Freshfields - have already committed to making working from home a permanent part of their 
business model. But John Wood, chief executive of the CIIA, warned that "the risk of a culture crisis must be 
considered by all businesses pursuing a hybrid business model".
Hybrid work makes it harder to detect fraud, say auditors; Support services
Business continuity, crisis management and disaster response was the category of risk most heightened by the 
pandemic and deemed an area of major concern by two-thirds of respondents, the CIIA poll found. Cyber and data 
security was second, followed by health, safety and security.
The erosion of organisational culture shot up as an area of worry, to fourth place from 11th a year earlier, and now 
ranks above concerns such as financial, liquidity and insolvency risks, and digital disruption.
Reduced face-to-face interaction between colleagues in a hybrid environment would curtail previous processes for 
building culture and team cohesion, said the CIIA, a professional association representing 10,000 internal auditors 
across all sectors in the UK and Ireland.
"Water cooler moments or conversations over the top of a desk, can't happen in a virtual environment," Hywel Ball, 
UK chair of accountant EY, said.
"Simple actions, such as ensuring junior colleagues are invited or updated after meetings, can make a really big 
difference to whether people feel included."

 Police searched the machine during the night after it requested emergency authorization to land in the German 
capital.A Ryanair passenger plane flying between Ireland and Poland made an emergency landing in Berlin on 
Sunday, German police said. 
How events unfolded 
The flight with 160 people on board was en route from Dublin to Krakow when it arrived at the Berlin-Brandenburg 
airport shortly after 8 p.m. (1800 UTC) on Sunday. It remained grounded at the airport into early Monday morning.  
Germany's federal police arrived at the scene. They used detection dogs to inspect baggage before it was taken 
inside the airport. 
A Berlin police spokeswoman said that officers had completed their security checks but they had not detected any 
danger. 
"The passengers will resume their journey to Poland aboard a different airplane," the police spokeswoman told 
news agency AFP, without providing further information. 
Passengers were able to travel on in a replacement plane at around 4 a.m. local time. 
Reason for unscheduled landing not yet clear 
The Ryanair plane made the landing after reporting an air emergency and "was therefore immediately given a 
landing permit at BER," airport spokesman Jan-Peter Haack told German tabloid newspaper Bild. 
Bild reported that the unexpected diversion came after a reported bomb threat but police did not publicly comment 
on details of the operation. 
The incident took place a week after another Ryanair flight was forced to land in Belarus' capital Minsk before 
authorities arrested a journalist onboard. The forced diversion prompted international outcry and the European 
Union subsequently urged its airlines to avoid Belarus airspace. 
The official reason given for the forced diversion of the Ryanair flight by Belarus earlier in May was a reported bomb 
threat. 
In July last year, another Ryanair plane from Dublin to Krakow was forced to make an emergency landing in London 
after a false bomb threat.

 A Ryanair passenger plane made an emergency landing in Berlin before resuming its journey to Poland, German 
police said late Sunday without releasing further details. 
 The flight from Dublin to Krakow made the unexpected diversion after a reported bomb threat, German newspaper 
Bild Zeitung said. 
 With 160 people on board, the flight arrived at the Berlin-Brandenburg airport shortly after 8 pm (1800 GMT) 
Sunday, remaining on the tarmac into early Monday morning. 
 A Berlin police spokesperson said that officers had completed their security checks 'without any danger being 
detected'. 
 'The passengers will resume their journey to Poland on board a spare aeroplane,' she told AFP, without giving 
more precise details for the alert. 
 The flight was emptied with the baggage also searched, German media reported. 
 'The Ryanair plane that made an emergency landed reported an air emergency and was therefore immediately 
given a landing permit at BER,' airport spokesman Jan-Peter Haack told Bild. 
 'The aircraft is currently in a safe position,' a spokeswoman for the police told the newspaper. 
 The incident comes a week after a Ryanair flight was forced to divert to Belarus, with a passenger — a dissident 
journalist — arrested on arrival. 
 And in July last year, another Ryanair plane from Dublin to Krakow was forced to make an emergency landing in 
London after a false bomb threat.

It was two years ago, after Belarusian authorities arrested a friend on apparently fabricated drug charges, that 
Roman Protasevich first noticed suspicious men following him in Minsk and fled to Poland, where he sought political 
asylum.
Since then, the dissident blogger and other opposition figures have fought President Alexander Lukashenko from 
European capitals such as Vilnius and Warsaw. Home to large communities of expatriates at odds with the regime, 
they thought they were beyond his reach and protected by EU law.
Last Sunday, though, that calculation changed dramatically. Lukashenko scrambled a fighter jet to force down a 
Ryanair plane and arrested Protasevich as he flew home to Vilnius from a Greek holiday with his girlfriend.
"He thought he was safe. He had no way of knowing what was going to happen - he was on EU territory on an EU 
flight," Protasevich's father Dmitry told the FT.
Lukashenko's move prompted immediate western opprobrium and the promise of EU sanctions. While that 
heartened Belarus's opposition leaders, it also injected a new layer of fear into their lives. Most of them are already 
in prison or in exile, where they fear for the safety of relatives back home.
Dissident's arrest chills Lukashenko opponents; Exiles. Regime threat Strongman president has made clear 
activists should feel unsafe wherever they are
"Right now no one is safe any more. Neither in Belarus, nor in the EU," said Franak Viacorka, an aide to Sviatlana
Tsikhanouskaya, the opposition presidential candidate who fled to Vilnius last year after threats from Belarus's 
security agency, still known as the KGB as in its Soviet days.
It was last August that Lukashenko, a mustachioed former collective farm boss who has ruled with an iron fist for 27 
years, escalated his crackdown on dissent, after hundreds of thousands protested against his re-election.
Police have since arrested more than 34,000 on protest-related charges, allegedly torturing many in custody. Yet 
even by those standards, Protasevich's arrest was an escalation of repression and a worrying sign of worse to 
come.
Protasevich's arrest was a particular jolt for Tsikhanouskaya and Viacorka, as they had taken the same flight from 
Athens only a week earlier. "The entire KGB is working right now to destroy Tsikhanouskaya. We need to be aware 
of it and we need to take care of ourselves," Viacorka said.
It was in 2010 that Belarus's exile community began to grow when Lukashenko last cracked down on large protests 
after he claimed a landslide election victory.
In response, western countries increased support to opposition-leaning media including US-funded Radio Free 
Europe and Polish-funded Belsat. Even so, for several years, dissidents continued to visit Belarus.
But then Nexta, a Poland-based opposition channel on messaging app Telegram, began publishing leaks from 
Belarusian authorities and films implicating
Lukashenko in corruption.
Last summer Nexta played a leading role in publishing on-the-ground accounts of the protests, even sometimes 
appearing to direct them. Edited then by Protasevich, its audience at one point topped 2m - an enormous number in 
a country of just 9.5m.
Nexta's success broadcast the depth of Belarusians' frustration with Lukashenko. But it also seems to have 
convinced Lukashenko that exiled dissidents posed an existential threat to his rule. "The journalists and their 
channels didn't mince their words. They really insulted [Lukashenko and his regime]," said Igor Trushkevich, a 
Belarusian dissident living in Ukraine. "It's entirely possible that Lukashenko was personally offended ... he doesn't 
forgive slights."
To tighten the noose around Protasevich, a KGB agent tried to convince his father, a retired lieutenant colonel, to 
trick his son into going to Prague, where security forces would kidnap him, his family said. When his parents moved 
to
Poland, Lukashenko personally stripped Protasevich's father of his military rank.
Nexta's sources also became targets. Belarus' supreme court this month sentenced an army officer to 18 years in 
prison for sending Nexta a document showing the interior ministry had requested thousands of troops to put down 
"mass disturbances."
Stsiapan Putsila, Nexta's founder, said he and colleagues had been receiving threats since Protasevich's arrest that 
they would be killed, or handed over to the Belarusian authorities, or their Warsaw office blown up.
Trushkevich believes the Ryanair flight's forced landing was also designed to frighten Nexta's readers.
After a turbulent week, the opposition inside Belarus has mixed emotions. There is horror at the arrest of 
Protasevich and his girlfriend. But there is also hope it will prompt the international community to take tougher 
action against Lukashenko.
Dissident's arrest chills Lukashenko opponents; Exiles. Regime threat Strongman president has made clear 
activists should feel unsafe wherever they are
"That day when we were trying to figure out what was going on, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat. It was terrible," said 
Aksana, a Minsk businesswoman. "On the other hand, I hope the situation reminds the world to pay attention to us, 
because we can't do it on our own."

It was two years ago, after Belarusian authorities arrested a friend on apparently fabricated drug charges, that 
Roman Protasevich first noticed suspicious men following him in Minsk and fled to Poland, where he sought political 
asylum.
Since then, the dissident blogger and other opposition figures have fought President Alexander Lukashenko from 
European capitals such as Vilnius and Warsaw. Home to large communities of expatriates at odds with the regime, 
they thought they were beyond his reach and protected by EU law.
Last Sunday, though, that calculation changed dramatically. Lukashenko scrambled a fighter jet to force down a 
Ryanair plane and arrested Protasevich as he flew home to Vilnius from a Greek holiday with his girlfriend.
"He thought he was safe. He had no way of knowing what was going to happen - he was on EU territory on an EU 
flight," Protasevich's father Dmitry told the FT.
Lukashenko's move prompted immediate western opprobrium and the promise of EU sanctions. While that 
heartened Belarus's opposition leaders, it also injected a new layer of fear into their lives. Most of them are already 
in prison or in exile, where they fear for the safety of relatives back home.

activists should feel unsafe wherever they are
"Right now no one is safe any more. Neither in Belarus, nor in the EU," said Franak Viacorka, an aide to Sviatlana
Tsikhanouskaya, the opposition presidential candidate who fled to Vilnius last year after threats from Belarus's 
security agency, still known as the KGB as in its Soviet days.
It was last August that Lukashenko, a mustachioed former collective farm boss who has ruled with an iron fist for 27 
years, escalated his crackdown on dissent, after hundreds of thousands protested against his re-election.
Police have since arrested more than 34,000 on protest-related charges, allegedly torturing many in custody. Yet 
even by those standards, Protasevich's arrest was an escalation of repression and a worrying sign of worse to 
come.
Protasevich's arrest was a particular jolt for Tsikhanouskaya and Viacorka, as they had taken the same flight from 
Athens only a week earlier. "The entire KGB is working right now to destroy Tsikhanouskaya. We need to be aware 
of it and we need to take care of ourselves," Viacorka said.
It was in 2010 that Belarus's exile community began to grow when Lukashenko last cracked down on large protests 
after he claimed a landslide election victory.
In response, western countries increased support to opposition-leaning media including US-funded Radio Free 
Europe and Polish-funded Belsat. Even so, for several years, dissidents continued to visit Belarus.
But then Nexta, a Poland-based opposition channel on messaging app Telegram, began publishing leaks from 
Belarusian authorities and films implicating
Lukashenko in corruption.
Last summer Nexta played a leading role in publishing on-the-ground accounts of the protests, even sometimes 
appearing to direct them. Edited then by Protasevich, its audience at one point topped 2m - an enormous number in 
a country of just 9.5m.
Nexta's success broadcast the depth of Belarusians' frustration with Lukashenko. But it also seems to have 
convinced Lukashenko that exiled dissidents posed an existential threat to his rule. "The journalists and their 
channels didn't mince their words. They really insulted [Lukashenko and his regime]," said Igor Trushkevich, a 
Belarusian dissident living in Ukraine. "It's entirely possible that Lukashenko was personally offended ... he doesn't 
forgive slights."
To tighten the noose around Protasevich, a KGB agent tried to convince his father, a retired lieutenant colonel, to 
trick his son into going to Prague, where security forces would kidnap him, his family said. When his parents moved 
to
Poland, Lukashenko personally stripped Protasevich's father of his military rank.
Nexta's sources also became targets. Belarus' supreme court this month sentenced an army officer to 18 years in 
prison for sending Nexta a document showing the interior ministry had requested thousands of troops to put down 
"mass disturbances."
Stsiapan Putsila, Nexta's founder, said he and colleagues had been receiving threats since Protasevich's arrest that 
they would be killed, or handed over to the Belarusian authorities, or their Warsaw office blown up.
Trushkevich believes the Ryanair flight's forced landing was also designed to frighten Nexta's readers.
After a turbulent week, the opposition inside Belarus has mixed emotions. There is horror at the arrest of 
Protasevich and his girlfriend. But there is also hope it will prompt the international community to take tougher 
action against Lukashenko.
Dissident's arrest chills Lukashenko opponents Exiles. Regime threat Strongman president has made clear

"That day when we were trying to figure out what was going on, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat. It was terrible," said 
Aksana, a Minsk businesswoman. "On the other hand, I hope the situation reminds the world to pay attention to us, 
because we can't do it on our own."

 Ryanair's (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) commercial flight landed unexpectedly in Berlin on Sunday evening following a 
reported bomb threat when it was on its way to Krakow, Poland, according to media reports on Monday.
German newspaper Bild Zeitung cited a Berlin police spokesperson saying that officers run security checks "without 
any danger being detected." 
The 160 passengers onboard are expected to resume their journey to Poland on a different flight but no further 
details were given by the spokesperson. 
The emergency landing comes a week after another Ryanair aircraft was forcefully diverted to Minsk, Belarus, with 
the country's authorities subsequently arresting a dissident journalist onboard the flight.
Shares in Ryanair were up 1% Monday morning.

Russian federal aviation agency Rosaviatsiya disapproved a new route bypassing Belarus, Reuters reported 
Monday, citing a press statement from the air carrier. 
The decision is part of the stand-off between European airlines and Russia after Belarus forced the landing of a 
Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) flight that was passing over its air space, prompting European authorities to promote a 
bypass of Belarusian air space.   
Shares of the French-Dutch company were marginally up on Monday afternoon.

 Russia authorized Air France-KLM (AF.PA) and Lufthansa's (LHA.F) flights bypassing the Belarusian airspace to 
Moscow, Reuters reported May 29, citing spokespeople for the airlines.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency previously compelled airlines to steer clear of Belarus and its airspace 
after the country forced a Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) jet bound to Lithuania to land to arrest an onboard journalist.
Air France received the green light for the one or two flights a day it operates over the weekend between Paris and 
Moscow, while Lufthansa received the approval for the seven weekly return flights from Frankfurt to Moscow and 
three return flights from Frankfurt to St. Petersburg for the "foreseeable future."
Air France-KLM's stock rose over 3%, Lufthansa stock gained over 1% and Ryanair's shares increased marginally

NATO is to more strictly control access to its headquarters in the Belgian capital for Belarusian officials, according 
the alliance's secretary general, in the wake of a forced Ryanair flight diversion that stoked international outrage.
"We have decided to restrict the access of Belarusian personnel to the NATO headquarters based on our 
assessment of security measures," defence alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg told reporters on Monday.
The decision comes after the forced rerouting to Minsk of a passenger jet travelling between two NATO member 
countries - Greece and Lithuania - earlier this month in order to detain a dissident Belarusian journalist and his 
girlfriend.
NATO's 30 member states condemned the move and called for the immediate release of Roman Protasevich and 
Sofia Sapega in a joint statement last week.
Minsk's envoy in Brussels is Aleksandr Mikhnevich, who represents the former Soviet republic - bordering 
several EU states and Russia - at both NATO and the European Union.
Belarus has participated in NATO partnership programmes since the 1990s. However, in view of the government's 
crackdown on political opposition, relations with Minsk have been strained for years.

 Minsk's border agency has announced new rules that will make it nearly impossible to leave the country. As 
citizens attempt to flee Belarus, longtime leader Alexander Lukashenko appears to be closing all the exits.Belarus' 
border security agency on Monday announced a severe tightening of already strict rules limiting citizens' ability to 
exit the country — even if they have long-term residency permits abroad. 
The changes, which the agency said were temporary and designed to stop the spread of the coronavirus, 
essentially block all land border crossings.  
Ever more citizens have fled the former Soviet bloc country since Alexander Lukashenko was declared the winner 
of a disputed presidential election last August and mass protests over election rigging were met with a severe 
crackdown. 
What changes under the new rules? 
Faced with the prospect of a mass exodus of medical and IT experts, the government in Minsk began making it 
more difficult for citizens to leave the country last December, by limiting departures to those Belarus citizens who 
could present long-term residency permits from abroad. 
The new rules now forbid the holders of such documents from leaving as well. Those who can prove that they have 
permanent resident status in another country will be permitted to travel abroad. 
Opposition slams 'violation of the law' 
Valery Kavaleuski, a representative for Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, took to Twitter to 
express his outrage, calling the move an "outright violation of the law."  
Air travel to and from the country has also come to a virtual standstill in the wake of last week's government-
ordered diversion of a Ryanair flight en route from Greece to Lithuania. 
The commercial jet was forced to land under false pretenses so that Belarus authorities could arrest blogger and 
Lukashenko critic Raman Pratasevich. 
The move outraged the wider world with the EU blocking most flights to and over Belarus. 
State carrier Belavia, in return, cancelled all flights to the EU — leaving those who wish to leave Belarus 
increasingly worried and running out of options.

German police examined a Ryanair passenger jet on the tarmac at Berlin Airport late Sunday after an unscheduled 
landing, police confirmed.
Why the plane en route from Dublin to Cracow stopped in Berlin around 8 pm (1800 GMT) was not immediately 
disclosed for operational reasons, a police spokesperson said.
The aircraft was taken to a parking spot away from the terminal. The 160 passengers were taken inside.
Police aided by sniffer dogs examined the passengers' luggage assembled near the plane.
It was unclear if and when the plane would be allowed to resume its journey.
Airport authorities lifted the night flight ban for the Ryanair flight as a precaution.
The Berlin tabloids B.Z. and Bild had first reported on the incident, which comes a week after after Belarusian 
authorities dispatched a fighter jet to force another Ryanair flight to divert to Minsk, where a dissident journalist who 
was on board was then arrested.

 Exiled Belarusians and international supporters have joined forces to form the German nonprofit Razam. They are 
showing their support by taking to the streets and showing solidarity with the opposition in Belarus.Anton Niadzelka 
lives in Berlin, but his heart is in his homeland, Belarus. The last time he visited the capital, Minsk, was two years 
ago. The 31-year-old mathematician has lived the last 10 in Potsdam, a city just outside Berlin. In April, he took 
over the chairmanship of Razam ("together," in Belarusian), a cultural nonprofit based in Germany. 
Razam's 220 members have one goal: help end the autocratic rule of Alexander Lukashenko, no matter how 
improbable that may seem. 
"We're taking care of those in prison," Niadzelka told DW. "We collect donations and send them to Belarus to help 
families there. We distribute information and hold discussions with governments around the European Union." 
Razam also looks after those who have fled, but "with the air routes blocked, that has become more difficult," 
Niadzelka said. 
State-sponsored terrorism in the sky 
The EU has ordered a halt to air traffic with Belarus since last week's forced landing of a Ryanair flight, which led to 
the arrest of leading opposition figures who were onboard, including exiled journalist and activist Raman Pratasevic, 
as well as his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, a Russian citizen. 
Razam gathered about 300 people last weekend at Berlin's busy Potsdamer Platz to protest what the organization 
considers an act of state-sponsored terrorism. 
"This hijacking is just the beginning," Heinrich Kirschbaum, a Slavic literature professor from Freiburg, Germany, 
told the protesters. "Lukashenko's crimes affect all of Europe, not just Belarus. He's becoming more and more 
unpredictable because he knows he can get away with it. Like he has for 27 years." 
Mixed feelings about flight ban 
Whether organizing demonstrations or events, or networking with like-minded groups, Niadzelka does what he can 
from Germany to support the opposition in Belarus. He has mixed feelings about the EU's quick response to stop 
air traffic to Belarus, which he sees as a means to prevent something similar from happening again. 
"But of course we'd like to see people from Belarus still be able to fly here," he said. 
Sanctions for companies linked to Lukashenko 
Niadzelka would like to see sanctions against companies that he says exist only to line the Belarusian president's 
pockets. The EU has refused to recognize Lukashenko as the legitimate leader of Belarus since last summer's 
elections were deemed neither free nor fair. Mass street protests against the result have been met with state 
Belarusian opposition gets a hand from allies in Germany
violence and the jailing of some 450 people, according to Razam. Some of them were pictured on a large banner at 
the weekend demonstration in Berlin. 
The latest round of civil unrest recalls a similar bout of popular anger about 10 years ago, when Belarus teetered on 
bankruptcy and was crushed by massive inflation. Then, as now, Lukashenko held onto power with the help from 
Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
"[Lukashenko] can see that he has fewer people within his security services standing by him. The economy is in 
bad shape. He doesn't have much money to pay back debt," Niadzelka said. "In 2011 he was able to get everything 
quickly under control. That's not the case this time around." 
Niadzelka hopes to see the mass protests in Belarus continue to grow, as they have in Germany, but he worries 
that it is getting harder to do so. That is why he and his friends wear photos of those in jail, speak to the media, and 
reach out to allies across Eastern Europe and Russia. Everything is for the goal of ending the decadeslong reign of 
the man often referred to as Europe's last dictator.

 Police searched the machine during the night after it requested emergency authorization to land in the German 
capital.A Ryanair passenger plane flying between Ireland and Poland made an emergency landing in Berlin on 
Sunday, German police said. 
How events unfolded 
The flight with 160 people on board was en route from Dublin to Krakow when it arrived at the Berlin-Brandenburg 
airport shortly after 8 p.m. (1800 UTC) on Sunday. It remained grounded at the airport into early Monday morning.  
Germany's federal police arrived at the scene. They used detection dogs to inspect baggage before it was taken 
inside the airport. 
A Berlin police spokeswoman said that officers had completed their security checks but they had not detected any 
danger. 
"The passengers will resume their journey to Poland aboard a different airplane," the police spokeswoman told 
news agency AFP, without providing further information. 
Passengers were able to travel on in a replacement plane at around 4 a.m. local time. 
Reason for unscheduled landing not yet clear 
The Ryanair plane made the landing after reporting an air emergency and "was therefore immediately given a 
landing permit at BER," airport spokesman Jan-Peter Haack told German tabloid newspaper Bild. 
Bild reported that the unexpected diversion came after a reported bomb threat but police did not publicly comment 
on details of the operation. 
The incident took place a week after another Ryanair flight was forced to land in Belarus' capital Minsk before 
authorities arrested a journalist onboard. The forced diversion prompted international outcry and the European 
Union subsequently urged its airlines to avoid Belarus airspace. 
The official reason given for the forced diversion of the Ryanair flight by Belarus earlier in May was a reported bomb 
threat. 
In July last year, another Ryanair plane from Dublin to Krakow was forced to make an emergency landing in London 
after a false bomb threat.

UN GATE, May 30 - Right after dissident blogger Pratasevich was grabbed off a Ryan Air flight forced to land in 
Belarus, many including the US spoke. 
 But for more than a full day, nothing from Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General who rarely takes questions 
and even had the Press which asked him about the mass killings in Cameroon thrown out of the UN. Alerthere[9]; 
new Belarus Blues songhere.[10] 
 Now on May 30, The chief editor of a popular Belarusian news site has been detained on Sunday and his home 
searched. Aliaksei Shota, editor of Hrodna.life, was detained with police officers claiming he was being investigated 
on suspicion of extremism. His site focuses on Grodno, Belarus's fifth-largest city. Authorities said Shota 'posted 
information products that were duly recognized as extremist.' 
 Officers confiscated computer hard drives from his home. Shota had worked with with Belarus's most popular 
internet portal Tut.by, before it was shut down by the government this month after 15 employees were arrested. 
From Guterres? Silence - he wants all P5 support for a second term. 
 On May 28, Guterres' UN Press Briefing Room hosted a press conference, from which Inner City Press was 
banned, in which the grabbing of Pratasevich was called fake news, in response to questions from state media. 
 Inner City Press has asked incoming UNSC president for JuneEstonia[11]for access - and it and the Free UN 
Coalition for Access (FUNCA) will report on all results.

Belarus enacts new rules restricting citizens from leaving

 Minsk's border agency has announced new rules that will make it nearly impossible to leave the country. As 
citizens attempt to flee Belarus, longtime leader Alexander Lukashenko appears to be closing all the exits.Belarus' 
border security agency on Monday announced a severe tightening of already strict rules limiting citizens' ability to 
exit the country — even if they have long-term residency permits abroad. 
The changes, which the agency said were temporary and designed to stop the spread of the coronavirus, 
essentially block all land border crossings.  
Ever more citizens have fled the former Soviet bloc country since Alexander Lukashenko was declared the winner 
of a disputed presidential election last August and mass protests over election rigging were met with a severe 
crackdown. 
What changes under the new rules? 
Faced with the prospect of a mass exodus of medical and IT experts, the government in Minsk began making it 
more difficult for citizens to leave the country last December, by limiting departures to those Belarus citizens who 
could present long-term residency permits from abroad. 
The new rules now forbid the holders of such documents from leaving as well. Those who can prove that they have 
permanent resident status in another country will be permitted to travel abroad. 
Opposition slams 'violation of the law' 
Valery Kavaleuski, a representative for Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, took to Twitter to 
express his outrage, calling the move an "outright violation of the law."  
Air travel to and from the country has also come to a virtual standstill in the wake of last week's government-
ordered diversion of a Ryanair flight en route from Greece to Lithuania. 
The commercial jet was forced to land under false pretenses so that Belarus authorities could arrest blogger and 
Lukashenko critic Raman Pratasevich. 
The move outraged the wider world with the EU blocking most flights to and over Belarus. 
State carrier Belavia, in return, cancelled all flights to the EU — leaving those who wish to leave Belarus 
increasingly worried and running out of options.

 Exiled Belarusians and international supporters have joined forces to form the German nonprofit Razam. They are 
showing their support by taking to the streets and showing solidarity with the opposition in Belarus.Anton Niadzelka 
lives in Berlin, but his heart is in his homeland, Belarus. The last time he visited the capital, Minsk, was two years 
ago. The 31-year-old mathematician has lived the last ten in Potsdam, a city just outside Berlin. In April, he took 
over the chairmanship of Razam ("together," in Belarusian), a Belarusian cultural nonprofit based in Germany. 
Razam's 220 members have one goal: Help end the autocratic rule of Alexander Lukashenko, no matter how 
improbable that may seem. 
"We're taking care of those in prison," Niadzelka told DW. "We collect donations and send them to Belarus to help 
families there. We distribute information and hold discussions with governments around the European Union." 
Razam also looks after those who have fled, but "with the air routes blocked, that has become more difficult," 
Niadzelka said. 
State-sponsored terrorism in the sky 
The EU has ordered a halt to air traffic with Belarus since last week's forced landing of a Ryanair flight, which led to 
the arrest of leading opposition figures who were onboard, including exiled journalist and activist Raman Pratasevic, 
as well as his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, a Russian citizen. 
Razam gathered around 300 people last weekend at Berlin's busy Potsdamer Platz to protest what it considers an 
act of state-sponsored terrorism. 
"This hijacking is just the beginning," Heinrich Kirschbaum, a Slavic literature professor from Freiburg, Germany, 
told the protesters. "Lukashenko's crimes affect all of Europe, not just Belarus. He's becoming more and more 
unpredictable because he knows he can get away with it. Like he has for 27 years." 
Mixed feelings about flight ban 
Whether organizing demonstrations or events, or networking with likeminded groups, Niadzelka does what he can 
from here to support the opposition in Belarus. He has mixed feelings about the EU's quick response to stop air 
traffic to Belarus, which he sees as a means to prevent something similar from happening again. 
"But of course we'd like to see people from Belarus still be able to fly here." 
Sanctions for companies linked to Lukashenko 
Niadzelka would like to see sanctions against companies that he says exist only to line the Belarusian president's 
pockets. The EU has refused to recognize Lukashenko as the legitimate leader of Belarus since last summer's 
elections were deemed neither free nor fair. Mass street protests against the result have been met with state 
Belarusian opposition gets a hand from allies in Germany
violence and the jailing of some 450 people, according to Razam. Some of them were pictured on a large banner at 
the weekend demonstration in Berlin. 
The latest round of civil unrest in Belarus recalls a similar bout of popular anger about ten years ago, when the 
country teetered on bankruptcy and was crushed by massive inflation. Then, as now, Lukashenko held onto power 
with the help from Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
"[Lukashenko] can see that he has fewer people within his security services standing by him. The economy is in 
bad shape. He doesn't have much money to pay back debt," Niadzelka said. "In 2011 he was able to get everything 
quickly under control. That's not the case this time around." 
Niadzelka hopes to see the mass protests in Belarus continue to grow, as they are in Germany, but he worries it is 
getting harder to do so. That is why he and his friends wear photos of those in jail, speak to the media, and reach 
out to allies across Eastern Europe and Russia. Everything is for the goal of ending the decades-long reign of the 
man often referred to as the last dictator of Europe.

 By for Georgian Institute for Security Policy[1] 
On May 18, Belarus' most popular internet portal TUT.by was shut down. In addition to the editorial office, 
journalists were also searched and 15 employees of the newspaper were arrested. 
There is no rest for the wicked, they say, and if it's indeed true, then Belarus strongman President Alexander 
Lukashenko might just be suffering from acute insomnia. Shutting down TUT.by evidently couldn't sate his appetite, 
though, as, on Sunday, May 23, he committed a direct act of state terrorism: a Belarusian fighter jet forced a 
Ryanair flight, which was flying from Athens to Vilnius, to land at Minsk Airport. After the forced landing, passenger 
Roman Protasevich, founder and ex-editor of the opposition Telegram channel Nexta was promptly arrested. 
While the West ponders a new round of sanctions, the pivotal question puzzling analysts and opinion-makers alike 
is what is on Lukashenko's mind? Why is the self-proclaimed president so willing to aggravate things even further? 
Especially in a situation where active protests in the country have been suppressed and his power, at least in the 
immediate future, seems no longer threatened? These were the questions GISP asked Maria Avdeeva, Research 
Director at the European Expert Association. 
The Protasevich incident has already been dubbed an 'act of state terrorism,' and inducted Lukashenka into an 
increasingly narrow group of international pariah leaders. Is there a way out of this for him to ever be considered as 
a legitimate political figure again? 
The crimes committed against his own population after the 2020 elections already made another rapprochement 
with the West very unlikely. However, one shouldn't still completely rule it out: previously, Lukashenko got away 
with even killing his political opponents. And yet, this last incident might just prove to be the final step that went too 
far. If there is any winner in this situation, it's Russia - as the already miniscule field for dialogue between 
Lukashenko and the West has diminished further, and now he is even more dependent on Russia. 
Lukashenko 'The Avia-Pirate' - Steadying The Sinking Ship?
It also highlights the impact of the 2020 protests on the Lukashenko regime, of its transformation. Whereas 
previously there was room for 'system liberals,' now they have been entirely replaced by the 'Siloviki'. But relying 
exclusively on the Siloviki has its own peculiarities. Now, the Belarusian regime is doomed to search for new 
enemies - the siloviki need a trademark outer threat to demonstrate their indispensability. And although, in the short 
term, this helps to keep the situation under control, it simultaneously shortens the regime's days. The political 
system built by Lukashenko is gradually moving into self-destructive mode. 
Shutting down Tut.by, kidnapping Protasevich - Lukashenko might think he is winning a battle but might he be 
losing the war? 
He is losing the war against his own people, as his position becomes more and more precarious, with precious little 
room for political maneuvers. In the eyes of the Belarus people, he is already an outcast, no longer one of their 
own. He might himself entertain notions to the contrary, and console himself with thoughts that there are no large 
scale protests anymore, his naysayers are in jail, that he succeeded to terrorize a whole nation into submission, but 
there is no way for him to get the trust of the people back. That bridge was burnt long ago, and it's only a matter of 
time before he starts losing the battles as well. 
His decree provides for the transfer of presidential powers to the Security Council of Belarus in the event of an 
emergency. What are the implications of such a move? 
He himself dubbed it a 'historic decree'. It's a military junta scenario; it tells the Belarusians 'whatever you do, 
nothing will change. If I am no longer around, the military will rule the country.' He wants to give the impression that 
he has everything under control, that nothing will happen and his regime will stay in power. It's also a precaution: if 
things go pear-shaped for him, he doesn't want all his power to be in one person's hand, which constitutionally 
would be the Prime Minister. On the foreign policy front, it's also a bow towards the Kremlin, indicating that 
Lukashenko's past bargaining with the West might be truly over and that now he is firmly in their grasp. 
For decades, Lukashenko was seen as trying to make his Presidency hereditary - given the current situation, is this 
scenario still on the cards? 
I think it might be shelved, but that doesn't mean it has been cancelled altogether. He is very worried about his 
sons, his family - by now, these might well be the only people that won't betray him given the chance. If Russia 
doesn't guarantee their well-being and safety, he should take care of that himself. As for transferring presidential 
powers to his offspring, I am sure he still entertains the notion, but his youngest son, whom he reared for such 
eventuality, is still too young. Trouble came knocking at Lukashenko's door earlier than he'd have liked. 
We need to discuss the so-called 'assassination' attempt as well- what was that all about? Who buys the narrative 
that the West ordered Lukashenko's death? 
Supporters of Lukashenko, and to an extent, Putin, more or less do believe what they are told. Especially the older 
generation for whom the state-run TV channels are the main source of information. Another thing it accomplishes is 
distraction from actual events and, obviously, giving the Kremlin propaganda, another lever to use in their Anti-
Western rhetoric. Even Putin mentioned it in his speech in front of the federal assembly. 
Increasingly, it looks like Lukashenko is cornered. And cornered predators, as they say, are at the most dangerous. 
What's the most dangerous move he could pull off? 
I'm very worried about the Belarusian people. What we are witnessing now exceeds any limits. 15 journalists in jail 
at the moment, charges all politically motivated, and tomorrow this number could rise to 150. And Lukashenko will 
keep on going - he sees the reaction from the West, but seems to think it's a risk worth taking. 
Lukashenko 'The Avia-Pirate' - Steadying The Sinking Ship?
There was a leaked conversation where his top level Siloviki were discussing creating quasi-concentration camps 
for 'untrustworthy' opposition figures - after Protasevich's arrest, it no longer seems so unthinkable. Especially 
considering that Lukashenko is a long-time admirer of the Soviet Union and probably more knowledgeable than 
most about Stalin's methods. 
He'll probably be forced to make some concessions to Moscow. Could one such be recognition of Crimea, 
Abkhazia and South Ossetia? 
The probability of that is quite high; there has been a constant pressure on Lukashenko from the Kremlin to make 
that happen. Unlike with the West, Lukashenko is still wary of burning bridges with Ukraine, and to an extent, with 
Georgia. Minsk as a place for mediation, and Lukashenko himself as the middleman between warring countries - 
that's a chair he's most comfortable sitting on and will be very loath to part with. 
Additionally, Ukraine is one of Belarus' biggest economic partners, and if he were to go that route, he'd have to 
suffer the Kyiv sanctions, which will hurt him more than the Western-imposed sanctions do. Ukraine and Belarus 
share a one thousand km long border - alienating such a neighbor is not in Lukashenko's interests, and it's not the 
same as throwing vague threats at the proverbial West. Were it to happen, though, I doubt such recognition would 
carry much political weight internationally - if anything it would further cement Lukashenko's image as a dictator.

Russia to support Belarus with 500 million dollars in credit

Russia is to support Belarus with 500 million dollars in credit over the coming weeks, the leaders of the two 
countries have agreed.
During a meeting, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko agreed the 
sum would be paid out by the end of June, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday, according to 
news agency Interfax.
This is the second tranche of a credit package that was agreed before the controversial forced landing of a 
passenger aeroplane in Minsk last Sunday in order to arrest a dissident blogger, Roman Protasevich, and his 
girlfriend Sofia Sapega.
During their meeting in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi, Putin and Lukashenko spoke about trade and economic 
cooperation, Peskov said.
Belarus' economy is weak, and it has already borrowed billions of dollars from Moscow.
During the opening of the meeting on Friday, both leaders complained about pressure from Western countries on 
Belarus.
After the incident with the plane - a Ryanair commercial flight between the two EU capitals of Athens and Vilnius 
that was forced to reroute and land in Minsk - the European Union and the United States imposed fresh sanctions 
on Belarus, which the Kremlin slammed as an emotional reaction.
Peskov emphasized that the fate of Sapega, who is a Russian national, mattered to the Russian authorities, but 
said the 23-year-old had a residency permit in Belarus.
Russia to support Belarus with 500 million dollars in credit
Meanwhile the president of the EU Parliament, David Sassoli, said he wants to keep up pressure Belarus in order 
secure the release of the blogger and his girlfriend.
Sassoli suggested that photos of Protassevich be exhibited at all airports in the EU and in the European Parliament.
"We will keep the attention and the pressure up and hope that this will lead to the release of Roman Protasevich 
and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega," he said in remarks to Germany's Funke media group.
Sassoli called the EU's initial reaction to the forced landing of a passenger jet in Minsk as "strong and unified."

(Alliance News) - Russia is to support Belarus with USD500 million in credit over the coming weeks, the leaders of 
the two countries have agreed.
During a meeting, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko agreed the 
sum would be paid out by the end of June, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday, according to 
news agency Interfax.
This is the second tranche of a credit package that was agreed before the controversial forced landing of a 
passenger aeroplane in Minsk last Sunday in order to arrest a dissident blogger, Roman Protasevich, and his 
girlfriend Sofia Sapega.
During their meeting in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi, Putin and Lukashenko spoke about trade and economic 
cooperation, Peskov said.
Belarus' economy is weak, and it has already borrowed billions of dollars from Moscow.
During the opening of the meeting on Friday, both leaders complained about pressure from Western countries on 
Belarus.
After the incident with the plane - a Ryanair commercial flight between the two EU capitals of Athens and Vilnius 
that was forced to reroute and land in Minsk - the EU and the US imposed fresh sanctions on Belarus, which the 
Kremlin slammed as an emotional reaction.
Peskov emphasized that the fate of Sapega, who is a Russian national, mattered to the Russian authorities, but 
said the 23-year-old had a residency permit in Belarus.
Meanwhile the president of the EU Parliament, David Sassoli, said he wants to keep up pressure Belarus in order 
secure the release of the blogger and his girlfriend.

Sassoli suggested that photos of Protassevich be exhibited at all airports in the EU and in the European Parliament.
"We will keep the attention and the pressure up and hope that this will lead to the release of Roman Protasevich 
and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega," he said in remarks to Germany's Funke media group.
Sassoli called the EU's initial reaction to the forced landing of a passenger jet in Minsk as "strong and unified."

 Alternative Version Of Who May Be Behind The Minsk Special Operation[1] 
On May 23, a plane of RyanAir airlines flying from the Athens to Vilnius carried out an emergency landing at the 
Minsk airport, following a bomb alert. This is widely claimed to be a special operation ordered by President Alexandr 
Lukashenko aimed at arrest of one of opposition figures Roman Pratasevich, who was on board.

Belarus' long time leader Alexander Lukashenko has spoken out on Wednesday over the Ryanair diverted flight 
saga, pushing back against widespread accusations coming from the former Soviet satellite country's opposition but 
especially Western leaders that his security services engaged in 'state hijacking' of the airliner carrying activist and 
blogger Roman Protasevich.

A Ryanair pilot who landed his plane in Belarus on Sunday repeatedly questioned information about an alleged

authorities in Belarus. Belarus scrambled a warplane to escort the flight, which was en route from Greece to 
Lithuania.

 President Biden on Sunday said that he plans to make human rights abuses a priority in his first meeting with 
Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva next month, CNN reports[1].  
Why it matters: Biden, who said in March that he believes Vladimir Putin is a "killer,[2]" has pledged to take a hard-
line approach against the Kremlin. During a speech in Delaware marking Memorial Day, Biden said that when he 
meets with his Russian counterpart on June 16, he will make "it clear we will not, we will not stand by and let him 
abuse those rights." Driving the news: Tensions have remained high between the two countries since Biden took 
office. On Friday, the White House announced new sanctions[3] against Belarus as punishment for forcing down a 
Ryanair flight to arrest an opposition journalist. The move came just hours after[4] Aleksandr Lukashenko met with 
his ally, Putin, in Sochi. The administration also warned last month there would be consequences[5] if jailed 
Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny dies in custody. Go deeper ... Secretary of State calls for 'stable'

 The two leaders, at odds with the West over recent political maneuvers, have enjoyed a boat trip near Sochi. Last 
week, a plane was forced to land in Minsk to arrest a blogger critical of the Lukashenko regime.Russian President 
Vladimir Putin took Belarus strongman Alexander Lukashenko for a boat trip on Saturday as the pair met for a 
second day of talks amid outcry over Minsk's decision to force a plane to land last week, and arrest a dissident 
blogger. 
"Yesterday was the day of official talks and today it's informal," Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov told reporters 
about the meetings in Sochi, a city on the Black Sea. 
Putin and Lukashenko took advantage of "the fine weather" and went "on a boat trip," the spokesman continued. 
Saturday's talks had centered on economic cooperation and the coronavirus pandemic, according to Peskov. 
Common ground 
Putin was keen to show his longstanding ally support over the latest standoff with the West.  
Last Sunday, Minsk forced a Ryanair plane, which was en route to Lithuania, to land in the Belarusian capital, 
where authorities arrested Raman Pratasevich, a blogger critical of Lukashenko's government, and his 23-year-old 
girlfriend. 
The West has since decried the decision to force the jet to land.  
The United States on Friday announced punitive measures targeting the regime while Brussels urged EU-based 
carriers to avoid Belarusian airspace. 
Putin and Lukashenko did not shy away from the events of last Sunday. 
"Lukashenko provided his counterpart detailed information about what happened on board the Ryanair aircraft," 
Peskov confirmed. 
The Kremlin was "not indifferent to the fate" of the detained blogger's girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, a Russian national, 
the spokesman added. 
Financial help 
Meanwhile, it was confirmed Russia will move ahead with a second installment of a $1.5 billion (€1.23 billion) loan 
to Belarus. 
Moscow gave Minsk the first $500 million last October, aimed at stabilizing its neighbor, with the second tranche set 
to be received before the end of June, both the RIA and Interfax news agencies reported.

Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya called for the world to stand with political prisoners on the 
one-year anniversary of her husband's jailing.
From her exile in Lithuania, Tikhanovskaya urged rallies to take place and once again demanded that Roman 
Protasevich, an opposition journalist and vocal critic of the Belarusian regime, be released.
Protasevich was arrested in Belarus after being taken off a diverted Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania nearly a 
week ago.
The incident triggered international condemnation and put the spotlight once again on the plight of journalists and 
activists in the authoritarian Eastern European country.
Tikhanovskaya's husband Sergei had wanted to run against long-time leader Alexander Lukashenko in the 
presidential election held in August, but was arrested at the end of last May. He faces years in prison.
His wife ran in his place. According to the official results, she lost the election, which was widely regarded as rigged.
The country's pro-democracy movement, however, sees her as the true winner and for weeks stage mass post-
election rallies, often resulting in hundreds of people detained. Tikhanovskaya fled to Lithuania for her safety.
The United States and the European Union no longer recognize Lukashenko as president and said they will impose 
sanctions in the wake of Protasevich's plane arrest.
Protasevich's girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, was also taken into custody after the Ryanair plane was forced to land in 
Minsk.

 The United States on Friday announced punitive measures against Belarus targeting the regime of strongman 
President Alexander Lukashenko, who met with Russian leader Vladimir Putin amid a global outcry over the forced 
diversion of a European plane. 
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki called for "a credible international investigation into the events of May 23," 
which she called "a direct affront to international norms." 
Belarus scrambled a military jet to divert a Ryanair plane and arrested 26-year-old opposition journalist and activist 
Roman Protasevich who was onboard, triggering a global outcry. 
The White House announced it was working with the European Union on a list of targeted sanctions against key 
members of Lukashenko's regime. 
Meanwhile, economic sanctions against nine Belarusian state-owned enterprises, reimposed by Washington in April 
following a crackdown on pro-democracy protests, will come into effect on June 3.

year, will meet for the first time since Belarus forced a Ryanair jet to land in Minsk and arrested an opposition 
activist onboard. Photo: Sputnik / Alexei Druzhinin  
Further US moves on Belarus could target "those that support corruption, the abuse of human rights, and attacks 
on democracy," Psaki said. 
The White House also issued a "Do Not Travel" warning for Belarus to US citizens, and warned American 
passenger planes to "exercise extreme caution" if considering flying over Belarusian airspace. 
 The European Union has also urged EU-based carriers to avoid Belarusian airspace. 
However President Vladimir Putin celebrated Russia's close ties with Belarus on Friday as he hosted Lukashenko 
in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. 
With observers closely watching the talks to see how far the Kremlin would go to support the regime, the Russian 
leader said he was "very glad" to see Lukashenko and agreed with him the Western reaction was an "outburst of 
emotion".

Lukashenko complained the West was seeking to stir unrest in Belarus. 
"An attempt is underway to rock the boat to reach the level of last August," he said, referring to anti-regime protests 
following a disputed election.

The Belarus strongman, who arrived with a briefcase, said he wanted to show Putin "some documents" related to 
the Ryanair incident and thanked him for his support in the latest standoff with the West. 
The talks lasted for more than five hours but their results were not announced. 
Over the past years Lukashenko has had a volatile relationship with Moscow, playing it off against the West and 
ruling out outright unification with Russia. 
But after the Ryanair plane incident his options appear to be limited. 
Putin and the Belarus leader have met regularly since August, when historic protests broke out against 
Lukashenko's nearly three-decade rule. 
 White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki called for 'a credible international investigation' which she called 'a direct 
affront to international norms' Photo: AFP / Brendan Smialowski  
The 66-year-old waged a ruthless crackdown on his opponents and has leaned increasingly on the Russian 
president amid condemnation from the West. 
Several people died during the unrest in Belarus, thousands were detained, and hundreds reported torture in 
prison. 
Sunday's plane diversion was a dramatic escalation, with EU leaders accusing Minsk of essentially hijacking a 
European flight to arrest Protasevich. 
The overflight ban has led to several cancellations of air journeys between Russia and Europe, after Russian 
authorities rejected plans that would have skipped Belarusian airspace. 
Russia insists the cancellations are purely "technical," but they have raised concerns that Moscow could be 
systematically refusing to let European airlines land if they avoid Belarus. 
The Kremlin criticized the flight ban as politically motivated and dangerous, with foreign ministry spokeswoman 
Maria Zakharova calling it "completely irresponsible". 
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc was monitoring whether this was a broader policy from Russia, 
but Moscow insisted the disruptions were in no way political. 
Belarus authorities claimed to have received a bomb threat against the Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius carrying 
the dissident. 
Minsk said it demanded the flight land in the Belarus capital based on the message it said was sent from a 
ProtonMail address by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. 
Protasevich, who helped organize the demonstrations against Lukashenko's rule last year, was arrested along with 
Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega, 23, after the plane landed in the city. 
Borrell has said proposals are "on the table" to target key sectors of the Belarusian economy including its oil 
products and potash sectors. 
Belarus opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya on Friday urged the EU to be "braver" and impose more 
sanctions against the Minsk regime. 
After meeting Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in The Hague, Tikhanovskaya said measures being discussed by 
EU countries did not go far enough. 
EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Friday warned Lukashenko that "it is time to change course." 
"No amount of repression, brutality or coercion will bring any legitimacy to your authoritarian regime," she said. 
The European Commission president also wrote to the opposition offering a three-billion-euro package to support "a

 Hundreds of people in Warsaw on Saturday rallied in support of the Belarusian opposition, days after the regime in 
Minsk diverted a European passenger plane and arrested a dissident journalist onboard. 
Among those present were the Poland-based parents of the detained journalist, 26-year-old Roman Protasevich. 
"I'm calling on all EU countries and the US to please help us free Roman and (his girlfriend) Sofia, as well as 
everyone else imprisoned," his mother Natalia Protasevich said. 
"We want to live in a free country, in a country where everyone has the right to express his beliefs," his father 
Dmitry added.

The crowd chanted "Long live Belarus" and held up the opposition's red and white flag as well as signs with slogans 
such as "Help Belarus," "Freedom for Belarus" and "North Korea in the Middle of Europe". 
Protasevich and Sofia Sapega, 23, were arrested on Sunday after Belarus scrambled a military jet to divert the 
Ryanair plane they were travelling on. 
Protasevich's parents said their son looked like he had been beaten in a video later released by Belarusian 
authorities. 
 The forced landing triggered a global outcry. The EU has banned Belarusian airlines, urged EU airlines not to cross 
Belarusian airspace and threatened tough economic sanctions on President Alexander Lukashenko's Kremlin-
backed regime. 
"Things look really bad now. That's why we need to do something, show those fighting back home that they're not 
alone," said Natallia Burak, a 35-year-old Belarusian living in Warsaw.

"I have a lot of hope now that Europe will help us, because it's hard to fight against a regime that has everything, 
that has power, whereas here we are just armed with flags," the saleswoman told AFP. 
"As a Belarusian, we see a lot of wild and outrageous things. You know, that same week there was a person killed 
in prison," said another Warsaw rally attendee, 38-year-old software engineer Alexey.

On Wednesday, Lukashenko said he had "acted lawfully to protect our people" from an alleged bomb threat on the 
plane. 
Often dubbed "Europe's last dictator", Lukashenko has retained his nearly three-decade-long grip on power by 
hounding opponents, jailing and allegedly torturing dissidents, and muzzling independent media. 
He and his allies are already under a series of Western sanctions over a crackdown on protests after his disputed 
re-election last August. 
His opponents say the polls were rigged and that political novice Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who ran in place of her 
jailed husband, was the true winner. 
The opposition leader and several hundred others marched to the Belarusian embassy in Lithuania on Saturday to 
protest Lukashenko's rule, while passing cars honked in support. 
"We will win. We will come back home and bring back our loved ones," Tikhanovskaya told the crowd in the capital 
Vilnius. 
"It is our duty to build a new Belarus."

US targets Belarus with sanctions amid Western outcry over plane

(Alliance News) - The US on Friday announced punitive measures against Belarus targeting the regime of 
strongman President Alexander Lukashenko, who met with Russian leader Vladimir Putin amid a global outcry over 
the forced diversion of a European plane.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki called for "a credible international investigation into the events of May 23," 
which she called "a direct affront to international norms."
Belarus scrambled a military jet to divert a Ryanair plane and arrested 26-year-old opposition journalist and activist 
Roman Protasevich who was onboard, triggering a global outcry.
The White House announced it was working with the EU on a list of targeted sanctions against key members of 
Lukashenko's regime.
Meanwhile, economic sanctions against nine Belarusian state-owned enterprises, reimposed by Washington in April 
following a crackdown on pro-democracy protests, will come into effect on June 3.
Further US moves on Belarus could target "those that support corruption, the abuse of human rights, and attacks 
on democracy," Psaki said.
The White House also issued a "Do Not Travel" warning for Belarus to US citizens, and warned American 
passenger planes to "exercise extreme caution" if considering flying over Belarusian airspace.
The EU has also urged EU-based carriers to avoid Belarusian airspace.
However President Vladimir Putin celebrated Russia's close ties with Belarus on Friday as he hosted Lukashenko 
in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
US targets Belarus with sanctions amid Western outcry over plane
With observers closely watching the talks to see how far the Kremlin would go to support the regime, the Russian 
leader said he was "very glad" to see Lukashenko and agreed with him the Western reaction was an "outburst of 
emotion".
Lukashenko complained the West was seeking to stir unrest in Belarus.
"An attempt is underway to rock the boat to reach the level of last August," he said, referring to anti-regime protests 
following a disputed election.
"It's clear what these Western friends want from us."
The Belarus strongman, who arrived with a briefcase, said he wanted to show Putin "some documents" related to 
the Ryanair incident and thanked him for his support in the latest standoff with the West.
The talks lasted for more than five hours but their results were not announced.
Over the past years Lukashenko has had a volatile relationship with Moscow, playing it off against the West and 
ruling out outright unification with Russia.
But after the Ryanair plane incident his options appear to be limited.
Putin and the Belarus leader have met regularly since August, when historic protests broke out against 
Lukashenko's nearly three-decade rule.
The 66-year-old waged a ruthless crackdown on his opponents and has leaned increasingly on the Russian 
president amid condemnation from the West.
Several people died during the unrest in Belarus, thousands were detained, and hundreds reported torture in 
prison.
Sunday's plane diversion was a dramatic escalation, with EU leaders accusing Minsk of essentially hijacking a 
European flight to arrest Protasevich.
The overflight ban has led to several cancellations of air journeys between Russia and Europe, after Russian 
authorities rejected plans that would have skipped Belarusian airspace.
Russia insists the cancellations are purely "technical", but they have raised concerns that Moscow could be 
systematically refusing to let European airlines land if they avoid Belarus.
The Kremlin criticized the flight ban as politically motivated and dangerous, with foreign ministry spokeswoman 
Maria Zakharova calling it "completely irresponsible".
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc was monitoring whether this was a broader policy from Russia, 
but Moscow insisted the disruptions were in no way political.
Belarus authorities claimed to have received a bomb threat against the Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius carrying 
the dissident.
Minsk said it demanded the flight land in the Belarus capital based on the message it said was sent from a 
ProtonMail address by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas.
Protasevich, who helped organize the demonstrations against Lukashenko's rule last year, was arrested along with 
Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega, 23, after the plane landed in the city.
Borrell has said proposals are "on the table" to target key sectors of the Belarusian economy including its oil 
products and potash sectors.

Belarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko accused the west of trying to destabilise his country when he met 
Vladimir Putin after a tumultuous week prompted the EU to ready sanctions on Minsk for forcing a Ryanair flight to 
land and arresting a dissident on board.
Speaking with the Russian president yesterday, Lukashenko said the EU was "trying to cause us problems" and 
said he would show Putin "who these people are" from a cache of secret documents he said he had brought in a 
suitcase.
"They are trying to destabilise the situation to the level of last August," Lukashenko said, referring to mass protests 
that he brutally repressed after they erupted last summer following his highly dubious election victory.
Lukashenko was in Sochi, seeking Russian backing after the Ryanair incident, and subsequent detention of 
opposition blogger Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, left him a pariah in Europe.
The two leaders can often seem like awkward allies. So their meeting is seen as a crucial test for Lukashenko who 
wants to show the west and domestic opponents his country can ride out increasing international isolation.
"If Russia wasn't supporting them politically, there's no way Belarus would act like this - not just downing the plane, 
but ... repressions inside the country," said Dzianis Melyantsou, an expert at the Minsk Dialogue Council on 
International Relations. "Even when Belarus behaves outlandishly, and it seems there's not much in it for Russia to 
Lukashenko plays victim to curry Putin sympathy; Belarus
support Belarus, Russia still shows it's the key ally. So Lukashenko is a lot more confident than he would be without 
that," Melyantsou added.
The meeting in Sochi was the fourth between Putin and Lukashenko since protests broke out in Belarus last year, 
reinforcing their hitherto faltering relationship. Belarus had previously tried to reduce its dependence on Russian oil, 
explored restoring US ties, expelled Moscow's ambassador, seized a stateowned Russian bank and arrested 32 
Russian mercenaries. Since last summer, however, Moscow has offered Minsk billions of dollars in loans; defended 
Belarus's right to intercept the plane; has not called for Sapega's release, even though she is a Russian citizen; and 
stood by as Belarus's security services harassed dissidents.
The Belarusian president has meanwhile insisted that exiled bloggers such as Protasevich are part of a US-funded 
dress rehearsal for attempts to overthrow Putin.
"Lukashenko has a compelling argument: Russia and Belarus have a common enemy in the west. Thus, you either 
support me or you eventually lose Belarus to the west," said Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center.
Even so, the Ryanair incident may make Belarus a problematic ally for Russia, said Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of 
political consultancy R. Politik. "It's one thing when you're doing an integration project with a country that everyone 
else respects. It's another thing where you're embracing a state that nobody else recognises as legitimate."
In a possible portent of that faltering legitimacy, the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization agreed late on 
Thursday to investigate Minsk's forced Ryanair grounding, with an interim report expected by June 26.
Lithuania yesterday also expelled two Belarusian diplomats, while Ukraine said it would prohibit any 
Belarusregistered planes from flying over national airspace as of this weekend. Additional reporting by Roman

 The Biden administration on Friday announced new crackdowns[1] against Belarus as punishment for forcing down 
a Ryanair flight to arrest an opposition journalist. 
The big picture: The announcement comes hours after[2] Aleksandr Lukashenko met with ally Vladimir Putin in 
Sochi. President Biden will be meeting with his Russian counterpart in Geneva on June 16. 
Details: TheUnited States on June 3 will reimpose full blocking sanctions against nine state-owned companies, 
which had previously been granted sanction relief "under a series of General Licenses by the Treasury 
Department." Belarus has been a target of U.S. sanctions in the past[3], particularly after Lukashenko claimed 
victory in a highly disputed election last summer and authorized violent crackdowns on protestors.The European 
Union announced earlier in the week that it would impose additional economic sanctions following the hijacking.The 
Treasury Department is also working on a new executive order, which would provide Biden further latitude to 
increase sanctions against the Lukashenko government and its allies. The White House reiterated its continued 
cooperation with its European allies, as well as the State Department's travel warning[4] for U.S. citizens. The 
statement also includes[5] the Federal Aviation Administration's advisory for U.S. passenger airlines[6] to "exercise 
extreme caution" when flying over Belarus. What they're saying: "We call on Lukashenka to allow a credible 
international investigation into the events of May 23, immediately release all political prisoners, and enter into a 
comprehensive and genuine political dialogue with the leaders of the democratic opposition and civil society groups 
that leads to the conduct of free and fair Presidential elections under OSCE auspices and monitoring," White House 
press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement on behalf of the White House.

 The US has said it's working with partners in the EU on a list of punitive measures targeting key members of the 
Belarusian government. The move is a response to the arrest of a dissident journalist on a Ryanair flight.The White 
House on Friday said the United States will target officials and businesses in Belarus with sanctions in response to 
an incident last week during which Belarusian authorities forced a commercial flight to land in Minsk and arrested a 
journalist on board. 
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki slammed the flight diversion as "a direct affront to international norms," in a 
statement released late on Friday. 
What are the new US measures? 
Psaki said the US is working with the EU and "other allies" to draw up a list of targeted sanctions against key 
members of President Alexander Lukashenko's government "associated with ongoing abuses of human rights and 
corruption, the falsification of the 2020 election, and the events of May 23." 
The US will also re-impose "full blocking sanctions" against nine Belarusian state-owned enterprises, which are 
companies that had been previously granted sanctions relief by the US Treasury Department. 
Under the updated measures, people in the US will no longer be able to carry out transactions "with these entities, 
their property, or their interests in property." 
The White House said these measures will come into effect on June 3. 
The US Treasury Department is also developing a new executive order to give the US "increased authorities to 
impose sanctions on elements" of the regime, and "those that support corruption, the abuse of human rights, and 
attacks on democracy." This executive order will be reviewed by US President Joe Biden. 
In addition to the sanctions, the White House issued a "do not travel" warning for Belarus to US citizens. It also 
warned US passenger planes to "exercise extreme caution" if considering flying over Belarusian airspace. 
What happened with the plane in Belarus? 
On May 23, authorities in Belarus forced a Ryanair plane to land in the capital, Minsk, citing a bomb threat. They 
sent a fighter jet to ensure that the passenger plane, which was flying from Athens in Greece to Vilnius in Lithuania, 
would land. 
Belarus: US to impose sanctions over plane diversion
After landing, authorities arrested 26-year-old Raman Pratasevich, an exiled Belarusian dissident and blogger, who 
was on board. 
He had left the Belarus in 2019, shortly before pro-democracy protests swept the country, which has been dubbed 
"Europe's last dictatorship." 
The EU and Group of Seven (G7) wealthy economies — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States 
and Britain — have condemned the incident. 
EU ministers met earlier this week to discuss a new round of economic and sector-specific sanctions for Belarus, as 
well as those against individuals linked to Lukashenko's government.

 The United States on Friday announced punitive measures against Belarus targetingthe regime of strongman 
President Alexander Lukashenko, who met with Russian leader Vladimir Putin amid a global outcry over the forced 
diversion of a European plane. 
 White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki called for 'a credible international investigation into the events of May 23,' 
which she called 'a direct affront to international norms.' 
 Belarus scrambled a military jet to divert a Ryanair plane and arrested 26-year-old opposition journalist and activist 
Roman Protasevich who was onboard, triggering a global outcry. 
 The White House announced it was working with the European Union on a list of targeted sanctions against key 
members of Lukashenko's regime. 
 Meanwhile, economic sanctions against nine Belarusian state-owned enterprises, reimposed by Washington in 
April following a crackdown on pro-democracy protests, will come into effect on June 3. 
 Further US moves on Belarus could target 'those that support corruption, the abuse of human rights, and attacks 
on democracy,' Psaki said. 
 The White House also issued a 'Do Not Travel' warning for Belarus to US citizens, and warned American 
passenger planes to 'exercise extreme caution' if considering flying over Belarusian airspace. 
 The European Union has also urged EU-based carriers to avoid Belarusian airspace. 
 However President Vladimir Putin celebrated Russia's close ties with Belarus on Friday as he hosted Lukashenko 
in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. 
 With observers closely watching the talks to see how far the Kremlin would go to support the regime, the Russian 
leader said he was 'very glad' to see Lukashenko and agreed with him the Western reaction was an 'outburst of 
emotion'. 
- 'Rock the boat' - 
Lukashenko complained the West was seeking to stir unrest in Belarus. 
 'An attempt is underway to rock the boat to reach the level of last August,' he said, referring to anti-regime protests 
following a disputed election. 
US targets Belarus with sanctions amid Western outcry over plane
 'It's clear what these Western friends want from us.' 
 The Belarus strongman, who arrived with a briefcase, said he wanted to show Putin 'some documents' related to 
the Ryanair incident and thanked him for his support in the latest standoff with the West. 
 The talks lasted for more than five hours but their results were not announced. 
 Over the past years Lukashenko has had a volatile relationship with Moscow, playing it off against the West and 
ruling out outright unification with Russia. 
 But after the Ryanair plane incident his options appear to be limited. 
 Putin and the Belarus leader have met regularly since August, when historic protests broke out against 
Lukashenko's nearly three-decade rule. 
 The 66-year-old waged a ruthless crackdown on his opponents and has leaned increasingly on the Russian 
president amid condemnation from the West. 
 Several people died during the unrest in Belarus, thousands were detained, and hundreds reported torture in 
prison. 
 Sunday's plane diversion was a dramatic escalation, with EU leaders accusing Minsk of essentially hijacking a 
European flight to arrest Protasevich. 
- Technical reasons - 
The overflight ban has led to several cancellations of air journeys between Russia and Europe, after Russian 
authorities rejected plans that would have skipped Belarusian airspace. 
 Russia insists the cancellations are purely 'technical,' but they have raised concerns that Moscow could be 
systematically refusing to let European airlines land if they avoid Belarus. 
 The Kremlin criticized the flight ban as politically motivated and dangerous, with foreign ministry spokeswoman 
Maria Zakharova calling it 'completely irresponsible'. 
 EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc was monitoring whether this was a broader policy from Russia, 
but Moscow insisted the disruptions were in no way political. 
 Belarus authorities claimed to have received a bomb threat against the Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius 
carrying the dissident. 
 Minsk said it demanded the flight land in the Belarus capital based on the message it said was sent from a 
ProtonMail address by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. 
 Protasevich, who helped organize the demonstrations against Lukashenko's rule last year, was arrested along with 
Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega, 23, after the plane landed in the city. 
- 'Braver' - 
Borrell has said proposals are 'on the table' to target key sectors of the Belarusian economy including its oil 
products and potash sectors. 
 Belarus opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya on Friday urged the EU to be 'braver' and impose more 
sanctions against the Minsk regime. 
 After meeting Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in The Hague, Tikhanovskaya said measures being discussed by 
EU countries did not go far enough. 
 EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Friday warned Lukashenko that 'it is time to change course.' 
 'No amount of repression, brutality or coercion will bring any legitimacy to your authoritarian regime,' she said. 
 The European Commission president also wrote to the opposition offering a three-billion-euro package to support 
'a democratic Belarus' if Lukashenko steps down.

 The two leaders, at odds with the West over recent political maneuvers, have enjoyed a boat trip near Sochi. Last 
week, a plane was forced to land in Minsk to arrest a blogger critical of the Lukashenko regime.Russian President 
Vladimir Putin took Belarus strongman Alexander Lukashenko for a boat trip on Saturday as the pair met for a 
second day of talks amid outcry over Minsk's decision to force a plane to land last week, and arrest a dissident 
blogger. 
"Yesterday was the day of official talks and today it's informal," Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov told reporters 
about the meetings in Sochi, a city on the Black Sea. 
Putin and Lukashenko took advantage of "the fine weather" and went "on a boat trip," the spokesman continued. 
Saturday's talks had centered on economic cooperation and the coronavirus pandemic, according to Peskov. 
Common ground 
Putin was keen to show his longstanding ally support over the latest standoff with the West.  
Last Sunday, Minsk forced a Ryanair plane, which was en route to Lithuania, to land in the Belarusian capital, 
where authorities arrested Raman Pratasevich, a blogger critical of Lukashenko's government, and his 23-year-old 
girlfriend. 
The West has since decried the decision to force the jet to land.  
The United States on Friday announced punitive measures targeting the regime while Brussels urged EU-based 
carriers to avoid Belarusian airspace. 
Putin and Lukashenko did not shy away from the events of last Sunday. 
"Lukashenko provided his counterpart detailed information about what happened on board the Ryanair aircraft," 
Peskov confirmed. 
The Kremlin was "not indifferent to the fate" of the detained blogger's girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, a Russian national, 
the spokesman added. 
Financial help 
Meanwhile, it was confirmed Russia will move ahead with a second installment of a $1.5 billion (€1.23 billion) loan 
to Belarus. 
Moscow gave Minsk the first $500 million last October, aimed at stabilizing its neighbor, with the second tranche set 
to be received before the end of June, both the RIA and Interfax news agencies reported.

Montral, 27 May 2021 - The ICAO Council expressed its strong concern today at the apparent forced diversion of 
Ryanair Flight FR4978, a commercial passenger aircraft flying in Belarus airspace on Sunday, 23 May 2021.

When the truth of the landing and the arrest was still unclear, the EU lashed out. Apparently, the bloc wished to do

responsible.

 The new routes follow EU advice against using Belarusian airspace. On Sunday, the Minsk government sparked 
international outrage by forcing the landing of a Ryanair jet to arrest a dissident journalist.Air France and Lufthansa 
on Saturday said they have received approval from Russia for flight routes to the country that avoid Belarusian 
airspace. 
Air France, which operates one or two flights a day between Paris and Moscow, said its new flight path was put into 
operation on Saturday for this weekend. 
However, a spokesman said the French flag carrier was still awaiting confirmation that the new flight path can also 
be used from next week. 
"We ... are awaiting a green light from Russian authorities for our flights after this weekend," a spokesman said. 
 A spokeswoman for Lufthansa said it had been given approval for the new routes on its flights from Frankfurt to 
Moscow and St Petersburg for the foreseeable future. 
Belarus off limits 
Airlines have been scrambling to agree on new flight paths after EU leaders urged airlines not to use Belarusian 
airspace in the wake of the May 23 forced landing of a Ryanair jet by the Belarus government. 
The plane was grounded on the pretext of a bomb threat and a Belarusian MiG-29 fighter escorted the passenger 
jet to Minsk airport where dissident journalist, Raman Pratasevich, was arrested. 
European leaders have accused Belarus of state-sponsored piracy and also barred Belarusian carriers from the 
bloc's airspace, prompting cries of a "despicable" response by the head of the Belarusian national airline Belavia. 
In a post on his Facebook page on Saturday, Director Igor Tcherginets said such steps amounted to sanctions on 
the carrier, which he described as an innocent party in the affair. 
"All this is happening before an investigation of the incident, for which there may be some guilty parties, but Belavia 
is definitely not among them," he added. 
Belarus has faced international sanctions in the wake of the violent crackdown on the protest movement against 
strongman Alexander Lukashenko's rule. His opponents say his election win last August was fraudulent. 
Flights canceled over airspace guidance 
Russia approves Air France, Lufthansa routes avoiding Belarus
Earlier this week, Air France and Austrian Airlines had to cancel several flights to Moscow because they hadn't yet 
confirmed an alternative flight path with Russia. 
Moscow blamed the delay in issuing new permits on the sheer number of airlines requesting new routes. 
Meanwhile, the International Civil Aviation Organization is mulling an investigation into the forced landing amid 
claims Russia was involved.

 Hundreds of people in Warsaw on Saturday rallied in support of the Belarusian opposition, days after the regime in 
Minsk diverted a European passenger plane and arrested a dissident journalist onboard. 
 Among those at the rally were the Poland-based parents of the detained journalist, 26-year-old Roman 
Protasevich. 
 'I'm calling on all EU countries and the US to please help us free Roman and (his girlfriend) Sofia, as well as 
everyone else imprisoned,' his mother Natalia Protasevich said at the rally. 
 'We want to live in a free country, in a country where everyone has the right to express his beliefs,' his father 
Dmitry added. 
 The crowd chanted 'Long live Belarus' and held up the opposition's red and white flag as well as signs with slogans 
such as 'Help Belarus,' 'Freedom for Belarus' and 'North Korea in the Middle of Europe'. 
 Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, 23, were arrested on Sunday after Belarus scrambled a military jet to 
divert the Ryanair plane they were travelling on. 
 Protasevich's parents said their son looked like he had been beaten in a video later released by Belarusian 
authorities. 
 The forced landing triggered a global outcry. The EU has banned Belarusian airlines, urged EU airlines not to cross 
Belarusian airspace and threatened tough economic sanctions on President Alexander Lukashenko's Kremlin-
backed regime. 
 'Things look really bad now. That's why we need to do something, show those fighting back home that they're not 
alone,' said Natallia Burak, a 35-year-old Belarusian living in Warsaw. 
 'I have a lot of hope now that Europe will help us, because it's hard to fight against a regime that has everything, 
that has power, whereas here we are just armed with flags,' the saleswoman told AFP. 
 'As a Belarusian, we see a lot of wild and outrageous things. You know, that same week there was a person killed 
in prison,' said another Warsaw rally attendee, 38-year-old software engineer Alexey.  
 On Wednesday, Lukashenko said he had 'acted lawfully to protect our people' from an alleged bomb threat on the 
plane. 
 Often dubbed 'Europe's last dictator', Lukashenko has retained his nearly three-decade-long grip on power by 
hounding opponents, jailing and allegedly torturing dissidents, and muzzling independent media. 
Parents of Belarus dissident journalist join Warsaw rally
 He and his allies are already under a series of Western sanctions over a crackdown on protests after his disputed 
re-election to a sixth term last August. 
 His opponents say the polls were rigged and that political novice Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who ran in place of her 
jailed husband, was the true winner. 
 Tikhanovskaya, who has been living in exile in neighbouring Lithuania, tweeted on Saturday that 'my husband was 
imprisoned by the regime exactly one year ago.' 
 She was due to attend a rally in solidarity with Belarus in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius on Saturday.

 Belarusian authorities detained a journalist after grounding his Lithuania-bound flight. Belarus is facing sanctions 
from the European Union and the United States as a result. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he supported 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. See more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin supported Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko as he faces criticism for 
the arrest of Roman Protasevich, a 26-year-old journalist and opposition activist. 
Belarusian authorities took Protasevich into custody after having his Lithuania-bound Ryanair flight grounded. [2] 
Lukashenko gave an "unequivocal order" to have the passenger plane ground in Minsk.  
In a call between the two leaders, Putin said the criticism of Minsk was "an outburst of emotions," according to a 
record of the call[3] released by the Kremlin.  
"We have things to discuss even without these events. I mean to say that in the first quarter of this year, our trade 
grew by a considerable 18.4 percent, and Russia remains a key trade and economic partner of Belarus. This is a 
good trend, and it is important to keep it going along with the Government's active work," Putin said.  
The support from Putin comes as the European Union agreed to impose sanctions on Belarus.[4] The sanctions 
include a ban on its airlines from using the airspace and airports of EU member states.  
The US also said it will re-impose full blocking sanctions against nine Belarusian state-owned enterprises[5] and the 
Treasury Department said it will develop a new Executive Order for President Joe Biden to review that will give the 
US more power to impose sanctions on Lukashenko's regime. Read the original article on Business Insider[6]

May 29, 2021( Voice of America: http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 WASHINGTON - The United States on Friday announced punitive measures against Belarus targeting the regime 
of strongman President Alexander Lukashenko, who met with Russian leader Vladimir Putin amid a global outcry 
over the forced diversion of a European plane. 
White House press secretary Jen Psaki called for "a credible international investigation into the events of May 23," 
which she called "a direct affront to international norms." 
Belarus scrambled a military jet to divert a Ryanair plane and arrested 26-year-old opposition blogger and activist 
Roman Protasevich who was onboard, triggering a global outcry. 
The White House announced it was working with the European Union on a list of targeted sanctions against key 
members of Lukashenko's regime. 
Meanwhile, economic sanctions against nine Belarusian state-owned enterprises, reimposed by Washington in April 
following a crackdown on pro-democracy protests, will come into effect on June 3. 
Further U.S. moves on Belarus could target "those that support corruption, the abuse of human rights, and attacks 
on democracy," Psaki said. 
The White House also issued a "Do Not Travel" warning for Belarus to U.S. citizens, and warned American 
passenger planes to "exercise extreme caution" if considering flying over Belarusian airspace. 
The European Union has also urged EU-based carriers to avoid Belarusian airspace. 
However, President Vladimir Putin celebrated Russia's close ties with Belarus on Friday as he hosted Lukashenko 
in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. 
US Targets Belarus with Sanctions Amid Western Outcry Over Plane
With observers closely watching the talks to see how far the Kremlin would go to support the regime, the Russian 
leader said he was "very glad" to see Lukashenko and agreed with him the Western reaction was an "outburst of 
emotion." 
'Rock the boat' 
Lukashenko complained the West was seeking to stir unrest in Belarus. 
"An attempt is underway to rock the boat to reach the level of last August," he said, referring to anti-regime protests 
following a disputed election. 
"It's clear what these Western friends want from us." 
The Belarus strongman, who arrived with a briefcase, said he wanted to show Putin "some documents" related to 
the Ryanair incident and thanked him for his support in the latest standoff with the West. 
The talks lasted for more than five hours but their results were not announced. 
Over the past years Lukashenko has had a volatile relationship with Moscow, playing it off against the West and 
ruling out outright unification with Russia. 
But after the Ryanair plane incident his options appear to be limited. 
Putin and the Belarus leader have met regularly since August, when historic protests broke out against 
Lukashenko's nearly three-decade rule. 
The 66-year-old waged a ruthless crackdown on his opponents and has leaned increasingly on the Russian 
president amid condemnation from the West. 
Several people died during the unrest in Belarus, thousands were detained, and hundreds reported torture in 
prison. 
Sunday's plane diversion was a dramatic escalation, with EU leaders accusing Minsk of essentially hijacking a 
European flight to arrest Protasevich. 
Technical reasons 
The overflight ban has led to several cancellations of air journeys between Russia and Europe, after Russian 
authorities rejected planes that would have skipped Belarusian airspace. 
Russia insists the cancellations are purely "technical," but they have raised concerns that Moscow could be 
systematically refusing to let European airlines land if they avoid Belarus. 
The Kremlin criticized the flight ban as politically motivated and dangerous, with foreign ministry spokesperson 
Maria Zakharova calling it "completely irresponsible." 
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc was monitoring whether this was a broader policy from Russia, 
but Moscow insisted the disruptions were in no way political. 
Belarus authorities claimed to have received a bomb threat against the Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius carrying 
the dissident. 
US Targets Belarus with Sanctions Amid Western Outcry Over Plane
Minsk said it demanded the flight land in the Belarus capital based on the message it said was sent from a 
ProtonMail address by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. 
Protasevich, who helped organize the demonstrations against Lukashenko's rule last year, was arrested along with 
Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega, 23, after the plane landed in the city. 
'Braver' 
Borrell has said proposals are "on the table" to target key sectors of the Belarusian economy including its oil 
products and potash sectors. 
Belarus opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya on Friday urged the EU to be "braver" and impose more 
sanctions against the Minsk regime. 
After meeting Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in The Hague, Tikhanovskaya said measures being discussed by 
EU countries did not go far enough. 
EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Friday warned Lukashenko that "it is time to change course." 
"No amount of repression, brutality or coercion will bring any legitimacy to your authoritarian regime," she said. 
The European Commission president also wrote to the opposition offering a 3-billion-euro package to support "a 
democratic Belarus" if Lukashenko steps down.

 The new routes follow EU advice against using Belarusian airspace. On Sunday, the Minsk government sparked 
international outrage by forcing the landing of a Ryanair jet to arrest a dissident journalist.Air France and Lufthansa 
on Saturday said they have received approval from Russia for flight routes to the country that avoid Belarusian 
airspace. 
Air France, which operates one or two flights a day between Paris and Moscow, said its new flight path was put into 
operation on Saturday for this weekend. 
However, a spokesman said the French flag carrier was still awaiting confirmation that the new flight path can also 
be used from next week. 
"We ... are awaiting a green light from Russian authorities for our flights after this weekend," a spokesman said. 
 A spokeswoman for Lufthansa said it had been given approval for the new routes on its flights from Frankfurt to 
Moscow and St Petersburg for the foreseeable future. 
Belarus off limits 
Airlines have been scrambling to agree on new flight paths after EU leaders urged airlines not to use Belarusian 
airspace in the wake of the May 23 forced landing of a Ryanair jet by the Belarus government. 
The plane was grounded on the pretext of a bomb threat and a Belarusian MiG-29 fighter escorted the passenger 
jet to Minsk airport where dissident journalist, Raman Pratasevich, was arrested. 
European leaders have accused Belarus of state-sponsored piracy and also barred Belarusian carriers from the 
bloc's airspace, prompting cries of a "despicable" response by the head of the Belarusian national airline Belavia. 
In a post on his Facebook page on Saturday, Director Igor Tcherginets said such steps amounted to sanctions on 
the carrier, which he described as an innocent party in the affair. 
"All this is happening before an investigation of the incident, for which there may be some guilty parties, but Belavia 
is definitely not among them," he added. 
Belarus has faced international sanctions in the wake of the violent crackdown on the protest movement against 
strongman Alexander Lukashenko's rule. His opponents say his election win last August was fraudulent. 
Flights canceled over airspace guidance 
Russia approves Air France , Lufthansa routes avoiding Belarus
Earlier this week, Air France and Austrian Airlines had to cancel several flights to Moscow because they hadn't yet 
confirmed an alternative flight path with Russia. 
Moscow blamed the delay in issuing new permits on the sheer number of airlines requesting new routes. 
Meanwhile, the International Civil Aviation Organization is mulling an investigation into the forced landing amid 
claims Russia was involved.

Belarus leader seeks Russian support amid showdown with EU
Belarus leader seeks Russian support amid showdown with EU

MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin warmly welcomed his counterpart from Belarus for talks Friday 
on forging closer ties amid Minsk’s bruising showdown with the European Union over the diversion of a passenger 
jet to arrest a dissident journalist.
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has found himself increasingly isolated since flight controllers told the 
crew of a Ryanair plane to land in Minsk on Sunday citing an alleged bomb threat. No bomb was found, but 26-
year-old journalist Raman Pratasevich was arrested along with his Russian girlfriend.
EU leaders denounced it as air piracy and responded by barring Belarusian carriers from the bloc's airspace and 
airports and advising European airlines to skirt Belarus. EU foreign ministers sketched out tougher sanctions 
Thursday to target the country’s lucrative potash industry and other cash-earning sectors.
At the start of his talks in the Black Sea resort of Sochi with Putin, Lukashenko ranted about the EU sanctions, 
describing them as an attempt to reignite the opposition protests that followed his reelection in August that was 
widely rejected as rigged.
“It's an attempt to destabilize the situation like last August,” he said.
Putin appeared relaxed and invited Lukashenko for a swim, while the Belarusian leader looked tense as he 
launched a long rant accusing the West of being perfidious and hypocritical.
In an emotional tirade, the 66-year-old Belarusian leader bemoaned the EU sanctions against the Belarusian flag 
carrier, Belavia, pointing to its role in carrying “thousands and thousands” of travelers from EU nations and the U.S. 
who were stranded at the start of the pandemic.
“They have punished the Belavia staff who have helped evacuate thousands of their people!” Lukashenko 
exclaimed. “What an abomination!”
Putin nodded in sympathy, pointing to a 2013 incident in which a private plane carrying Bolivian President Evo 
Morales landed in Vienna after several European nations had refused to let it cross their airspace, purportedly over 
Belarus leader seeks Russian support amid showdown with EU
speculation that Edward Snowden, who leaked classified U.S. government information, was on the plane. Austrian 
and Bolivian officials disagreed over whether the plane was searched after landing before resuming its journey.
“The Bolivian president's plane was forced to land, the president was taken off the plane, and it was OK, everyone 
kept silent,” Putin said with a chuckle.
Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who disclosed classified information about government 
surveillance programs, ended up in Russia, where he received asylum to avoid prosecution.
The showdown over the Ryanair diversion has pushed Lukashenko, who has relentlessly stifled dissent during his 
rule of more than a quarter-century, even closer to his main ally and sponsor, Russia.
The two ex-Soviet nations have signed a union agreement that calls for close political, economic and military ties 
but stops short of a full merger. Russia has buttressed Belarus’ economy with cheap energy supplies and loans, but 
the ties often have been strained with Lukashenko scolding Moscow for trying to force him to relinquish control of 
prized economic assets and eventually abandon his country's independence.
In his remarks at the start of Friday's talks, Putin said the countries were moving to deepen their union "consistently, 
without rush, acting stage by stage.”
In the past, Lukashenko has tried to play the West against Russia, raising the prospect of a rapprochement with the 
EU and the U.S. to wring more aid out of Moscow.
Such tactics no longer work after Lukashenko’s brutal crackdown last year. More than 35,000 people were arrested 
amid the protests and thousands beaten — moves that made him a pariah in the West. The flight’s diversion has 
now cornered the Belarusian strongman even more.
Lukashenko, a former Soviet state farm director, ended the leaders' appearance before cameras in Sochi by 
exclaiming, “There are no heights the Bolsheviks wouldn’t storm!” — a line apparently from a Soviet-era movie. The 
remark drew a wry laugh from Putin.
Many observers warn that the new, tougher EU sanctions would make Lukashenko easy prey for the Kremlin, which 
may use his isolation to push for closer integration. Some in the West have even alleged Russia was involved in the 
Ryanair diversion — something Moscow angrily denies — and will seek to exploit the fallout.
“Lukashenko is scared, and the Kremlin may demand payment for its political support by pushing for the 
introduction of a single currency, the deployment of military bases and more,” said Valery Karbalevich, an 
independent Minsk-based political analyst. “In this situation, it would be much more difficult for him to resist and 
bargain with Putin."
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Lukashenko's main opponent in the election who left the country under official pressure, 
also acknowledged the danger that Russia may try to use his weakness to its advantage. She urged the EU to use 
whatever influence it has to help prevent any deals with Moscow that would hurt Belarus.
At the same time, Tsikhanouskaya also urged the EU to be "stronger, braver in its resolutions and decisions,” 
saying Lukashenko acted out of a sense of impunity in diverting the flight.
The European Commission on Friday presented a 3 billion euro ($3.7 billion) aid plan to support “a future 
democratic Belarus” that could be activated if the country moves toward a “democratic transition.”
But in a further sign of Belarus’ isolation, the Geneva-based European Broadcasting Union moved Friday to 
suspend the Belarusian state broadcaster, BTRC, saying it has been particularly worried by its showing of 
interviews apparently obtained under duress. BTRC has two weeks to respond before the suspension takes effect. 
The move would bar Belarus from taking part in the Eurovision Song Contest, among other things.
Belarus leader seeks Russian support amid showdown with EU
Moscow has offered Lukashenko quick political support over the diversion, cautioning the EU against hasty action 
until the episode is properly investigated and arguing that Lukashenko’s actions were in line with international 
protocols in cases of bomb threats.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova denounced the EU’s decision to ask European airlines to 
avoid Belarusian airspace as “utterly irresponsible and threatening passengers’ safety.”
Dmitry Polyansky, Russia's deputy envoy at the United Nations, criticized the West on Friday for what he called a 
rash response and defended Belarus' narrative, arguing its flight controllers only “recommended” the plane land in 
Minsk because of the purported threat, and the pilot could have continued if he wanted.
“To say from the outset that this is a forced landing, to condemn it and to introduce sanctions without any 
investigation — this kind of behavior is absolutely irresponsible," he said at a news conference.
The International Civil Aviation Organization has said it will investigate the diversion, as many Western countries 
have asked.
As European airlines began skirting Belarus, Russia has refused some of their requests to change the flight paths 
of service to Moscow in the past two days but allowed some flights to proceed Friday. The Kremlin said the denial 
of quick permissions to use the bypass routes was technical, but Lukashenko hailed it as a show of support for 
Belarus.

Western sanctions weigh as Belarus' Lukashenko meets with Putin
Western sanctions weigh as Belarus' Lukashenko meets with Putin

Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, who's under increasing pressure from the West and EU sanctions, is 
heading to Russia on Friday to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The two leaders will discuss further developing their countries' ties when they get together in the Black Sea resort of 
Sochi, according to the Kremlin. Friday's meeting will be the third between the two leaders already this year.
Lukashenko says that he will also discuss the consequences of EU and US sanctions, which are currently hitting 
Belarus especially hard.
Minsk already owes Moscow billions, but Putin has recently repeatedly emphasized that the Kremlin would continue 
to support Lukashenko.
The meeting is taking place less than a week after Belarus forced a passenger plane to make an emergency 
landing in Minsk, saying there was a bomb threat aboard, which turned out to be an unfounded claim. During the 
incident, Belarus sent a fighter jet to accompany the Ryanair flight.
Roman Protasevich, a 26-year-old dissident journalist, and his partner were taken into custody after the landing, 
prompting a raft of measures by the EU, including restricted access to the bloc's airspace for Belarusian carriers.
Lithuanian authorities announced on Friday that they have questioned the crew and 90 per cent of the passengers 
who were on board at the time. The investigation of the plane, which remains at the airport in Vilnius, is still 
ongoing, according to the BNS news agency.
There had been more than 100 passengers on the plane at the time. They were delayed more than eight hours due 
to the plane diversion.
Western sanctions weigh as Belarus' Lukashenko meets with Putin
It was unclear on Friday whether airlines that were following the EU's recommendation were being blocked from 
landing in Russia.
Some airlines, such as Air France, reportedly had to cancel flights after alternative routes that avoided Belarus were 
not approved.
The EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said that he did not know yet if Russian authorities were making the decision 
case-by-case or had implemented a general rule, and would wait before taking any action.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov spoke of "technical problems" after the EU's decision, but said authorities 
were working to sort them out.
The Rosaviazia aviation authority said it was taking longer than usual to approve requests because more than usual 
had been coming in.

Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko complained to Russian President Vladimir Putin about increasing 
pressure from the West and EU sanctions during talks held in Sochi on Friday.
After a dissident's commercial flight between two EU capitals - Athens and Vilnius - was forced to reroute and land 
in Minsk, Brussels imposed sanctions that penalized state-owned airline Belavia, although it had nothing to do with 
the incident, Lukashenko said.
Regime critic Roman Protasevich was detained after landing in Minsk, sparking international condemnation.
At the leaders' meeting, Putin criticized an incident in 2013 when the Bolivian president's plane was diverted, 
without the EU's objections in what he called a US operation.
Lukashenko said he could prove that there had been attempts to destabilize Belarus since the contested elections 
in August that led to massive protests.
The presidential election was widely regarded as manipulated and hundreds of thousands of people called for 
Lukashenko's resignation.
Putin emphasized his support for Lukashenko, saying trade between the two countries had increased.
Their meeting came five days after Belarus claimed the plane had to make an emergency landing in Minsk due to a 
bomb threat, a claim which proved unfounded. During the incident, Belarus sent a fighter jet to accompany the 
Ryanair flight.

Protasevich, a 26-year-old dissident journalist, and his partner were then taken into custody, prompting a raft of 
measures by the EU, including restricted access to the bloc's airspace for Belarusian carriers.
On Friday, further information emerged about the forced landing, suggesting that the plane had been diverted 
before an email alleging the threat had been sent.
"We can see when the email was sent, and we can confirm that the email in question was sent after the plane had 
been diverted," the Proton email service in Geneva told dpa.
"We have not seen credible evidence that the Belarusian claims are true," the service wrote.
Belarus had claimed that Hamas had sent the threat, a suggestion Hamas repudiated as "absurd" shortly 
afterwards.
Earlier on Friday, Lithuanian authorities announced that they had questioned the crew and 90 per cent of the 
passengers who were on board at the time. The investigation of the plane, which remains at the airport in Vilnius, is 
still ongoing, according to the BNS news agency.
Meanwhile it was unclear on Friday whether airlines that were following the EU's recommendation were being 
blocked from landing in Russia.
Some airlines, such as Air France, reportedly had to cancel flights after alternative routes that avoided Belarus were

case-by-case or had implemented a general rule, and would wait before taking any action.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov spoke of "technical problems" after the EU's decision, but said authorities 
were working to sort them out.
Later, Lithuania expelled two Belarusian diplomats for activities that were "not compatible with their status," the 
Foreign Ministry said. Belarus responded by expelling two Lithuanian diplomats.
Looking to the future, the European Commission suggested providing billions in aid to support democratic change in 
Belarus.
It could make 3 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) available to Minsk "once Belarus embarks on a democratic 
transition," the commission said in a press release.
The move should be seen as the bloc's commitment "to support the Belarusian people's wishes for a peaceful 
democratic transition in the country."

The European Commission has suggested providing 3 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) to Minsk "once Belarus 
embarks on a democratic transition," it announced, five days after a dissident was arrested when his commercial 
flight was forced to land.
The proposal, which EU countries still have to assess, should be seen as the bloc's commitment "to support the 
Belarusian people's wishes for a peaceful democratic transition in the country," according to a press release.
Belarus has been rocked by protests following the disputed presidential election in August last year, in which long-
term leader Alexander Lukashenko claims victory. The EU considers the elections neither free nor fair.
Relations between the EU and Belarus soured further over the weekend when Belarusian authorities forced a 
Ryanair flight, heading from Athens to Vilnius, to land in Minsk, and arrested a journalist and his girlfriend who were 
on board.
"It should be a genuine incentive for the regime to change its course," EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said. 
"The EU remains truly committed to a democratic Belarus."
The money would be distributed in the form of grants and loans. It would be used to stabilize the country's economy 
and create jobs, as well as to "reform its institutions to make them more democratic," the press release said.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc supported democratic change in the country.
"When - and we believe it is a case of when, not if - Belarus starts its peaceful democratic transition, the EU will be 
there to accompany it," she said in a press release.

Russia's foreign ministry has condemned the EU's call for Europe-based airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace, 
calling it completely irresponsible.
Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, commenting after Russia had denied entry to two airlines that planned to avoid 
Belarus, said passenger safety was at risk.
EU leaders had acted after Belarus forced a Ryanair plane to divert and land in the capital, Minsk.
A Belarusian dissident journalist and his girlfriend were then arrested.
Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega, who is a Russian citizen, are both in jail. A court on Friday rejected her 
appeal against a two-month detention.
The EU's 27 leaders met this week and demanded their immediate release, as has the G7 group of nations.
The UN's civil aviation agency has said it will launch a "fact-finding" investigation into Belarus's actions, and 
whether there had been any breach of international aviation law.
No reason was given for Moscow's decision to refuse access to flights from Air France and Austrian Airlines, but an 
Air France spokesperson said Russia's requirement of a "new authorisation" was linked to the airline bypassing 
Belarusian airspace.
On Friday, Russia's aviation authority allowed entry to several European airlines bypassing Belarus, including 
Austrian Airlines, although Air France did cancel another Paris-Moscow flight. The aviation agency warned that 
airlines that changed routes might have to await longer clearance times.
Russia is Belarus's biggest ally and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko arrived in the Black Sea resort of 
Sochi on Friday for talks with President Vladimir Putin.
It is their third meeting this year.
Russia accuses EU of risking passenger safety
Up till now Alexander Lukashenko has been masterful at playing on the Kremlin's fears and phobias of the West, 
presenting himself as Russia's first line of defence against alleged external threats. Claiming - without proof - that 
Nato, the US, Europe are plotting to gobble up Belarus, and then move on to Russia.
So, in the face of Western sanctions, in Sochi he will expect President Putin to back him politically and, crucially, 
financially. Especially since Russia and Belarus are, on paper at least, part of a union state.
But although the two men are political allies, close friends they are not. There have been plenty of squabbles in the 
past. For years Moscow has been irritated by Mr Lukashenko's attempts to play Russia off against the West. The 
Kremlin views him as something of a loose cannon.
After the Ryanair jet drama and the arrest of two passengers, it's unclear what message the leader of Russia will be 
sending to the leader of Belarus.
The foreign ministry spokeswoman denounced EU leaders for deciding to "redraw the routes of hundreds of flights 
in a single day, creating colossal problems for its citizens".
Austria's foreign ministry said Russia's actions against the airline on Thursday had been "absolutely 
incomprehensible".
On Friday, the rules were relaxed as Austrian Airlines flight OS601 from Vienna was given permission to land in 
Moscow,.
Among the EU's immediate measures is a ban on Belarusian airlines over the airspace of its 27 member states. 
Ukraine is also banning Belarus-registered planes from its airspace from Saturday, having halted flights to and from 
Belarus.
Further sanctions are still being assessed on officials in Mr Lukashenko's government and Belarusian economic 
sectors in particular.
After meeting exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya in The Hague, Dutch Prime Minister 
Mark Rutte said it was time to target sectors "connected to the regime - and that is crucial because we have to hit 
these people in the wallet".
Belarus will lose out on millions of dollars a year in over-flight fees as a result of European airlines avoiding its 
airspace.
The EU measures have also hit Belarus carrier Belavia, which has now cancelled 16 European routes.
The BBC's Sarah Rainsford described lengthy queues outside Belavia offices in Minsk on Thursday as Belarusians 
scrambled to get ticket refunds.
In a separate move, the European Broadcasting Union said it was suspending Belarus state TV and radio, blaming 
suppression of media freedom. The company has two weeks to respond. Belarus was disqualified from this month's 
Eurovision song contest, organised by the EBU, for lyrics seen as targeting anti-government protesters.

Need some cash? Crowdfund offers fee for jailing Belarus' Lukashenko

One of Belarus' most famous entrepreneurs is willing to pull together top dollar for an important job, but anyone 
hoping to cash in has to be willing to put Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko behind bars.
Valeri Tsepkalo campaigned for the presidency in last year's elections, but fled Belarus before the polls after he 
grew concerned for his safety.
Now he's released a video on YouTube stating his intent to raise 11 million euros (13.4 million dollars) in a 
crowdfunding venture.
The money would be given to any member or members of the security forces who ensure that Lukashenko is put 
behind bars.
As of Friday, the effort has raised 60,000 euros.
But Tsepkalo says he's optimistic the gambit will work, arguing that there are still upstanding people in power in 
Belarus who are not willing to cooperate any longer with "criminal number one," as he calls Lukashenko.
Tsepkalo is one of many who have accused Lukashenko of fixing the election last year, as well as charges of 
murder and kidnapping.
Multiple sanctions have been slapped on the country since the widely panned elections, which the European Union 
and other democracies have failed to recognize.
Tensions with Belarus have ratcheted up after a Ryanair flight heading from Greece to Lithuania was forced to land 
in Minsk at the weekend because of an alleged bomb on board.
No bomb was found, but Belarusian authorities took advantage of the situation to arrest dissident blogger Roman 
Protasevich.
Need some cash? Crowdfund offers fee for jailing Belarus' Lukashenko
The 66-year-old Lukashenko has led Belarus, a former Soviet republic, for more than a quarter of a century, 
tolerating little dissent.

 President Vladimir Putin praised Russia's closer ties with Belarus on Friday as he hosted strongman Alexander 
Lukashenko amid a global outcry following the forced diversion of a European plane. 
Observers will watch the negotiations to see how far Russia goes to support Lukashenko's regime after Belarus 
scrambled a Mig jet to divert a Ryanair jet and arrest an opposition journalist onboard last Sunday. 
Following the Ryanair plane's forced diversion, the European Union urged EU-based carriers to avoid Belarusian 
airspace and promised fresh sanctions against Lukashenko and regime officials. 
Putin warmly greeted Lukashenko in Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi, saying he was "very glad" to see him and 
the two should go for a swim. 
"We've been building the Union State," Putin told Lukashenko at the start of the talks. "We are confidently moving in 
that direction, that work is already bringing concrete results to our citizens," he added. 
Lukashenko complained that the West was seeking to stir unrest in Belarus. 
"An attempt is under way to rock the boat to reach the level of last August," Lukashenko said, referring to the 
outbreak of protests against his regime following a disputed election.

year, will meet for the first time since Belarus forced a Ryanair jet to land in Minsk and arrested an opposition 
activist onboard. Photo: Sputnik / Alexei Druzhinin  
 "It's clear what these Western friends want from us." 
The Belarus strongman, who arrived with a briefcase, said he wanted to show Putin "some documents" related to 
the Ryanair incident and thanked him for his support in the latest standoff with the West. 
In carefully worded remarks in front of reporters, Putin said that when then-Bolivian President Evo Morales's plane 
was grounded in 2013 there was little Western outcry. 
"The president was led out of the plane, and nothing, silence," Putin said. 
A plane carrying Morales from Moscow was diverted and held up in Vienna for hours amid suspicions fugitive US 
whistleblower Edward Snowden was on board. 
Putin and Lukashenko have met regularly since August, when historic protests broke out against Lukashenko's 
nearly three-decade rule following a disputed election. 
Lukashenko, 66, waged a ruthless crackdown on his opponents and has leaned increasingly on Putin amid 
condemnation from the West.

Several people died during the unrest in Belarus, thousands were detained, and hundreds reported torture in 
prison. 
Sunday's flight diversion was a dramatic escalation, with EU leaders accusing Minsk of essentially hijacking a 
European flight to arrest 26-year-old opposition journalist and activist Roman Protasevich. 
The overflight ban has led to several cancellations of flights between Russia and Europe, after Russian authorities 
rejected flight plans that would have skipped Belarusian airspace. 
Russia insists the cancellations are purely "technical", but they have raised concerns that Russia could be 
systematically refusing to let European airlines land if they avoid Belarus. 
Moscow hit out at the flight ban as politically motivated and dangerous. 
 Minsk said it demanded the flight land in Minsk based on a message that it said was sent from a ProtonMail, but 
the company said the message was sent after the plane was re-routed. Photo: ONLINER.BY / -  
"What the West has done... for political reasons is completely irresponsible and endangers the safety of 
passengers," said Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. 
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc was monitoring whether this was a broader policy from Russia, 
but the Kremlin insisted the disruptions were in no way political. 
"Aviation authorities will give the necessary explanations, but these are technical reasons," Kremlin spokesman 
Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 
Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency said changes of previously approved routes could result in delays in 
obtaining arrival, departure or transit permits. 
Belarus authorities claimed to have received a bomb threat against the Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius carrying 
the dissident. 
Minsk said it scrambled a combat jet and demanded the flight land in Minsk based on the message it said was sent 
from a ProtonMail address by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. 
But Proton Technologies, which is based in Geneva, said the message was sent after the plane had already been 
diverted. 
"We can see the sent time and can confirm it was after the plane was redirected," it said on Twitter. 
The Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council announced Thursday it was launching 
an investigation, amid calls for Belarus to be banned from international air agencies. 
Protasevich, who helped organise historic demonstrations against Lukashenko's rule last year, was arrested along 
with Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega, 23, after the plane landed in Minsk. 
Both Protasevich and Sapega have since appeared in confession videos that their supporters said were recorded 
under duress and are a common tactic of the regime to pressure critics. 
Borrell has said proposals are "on the table" to target key sectors of the Belarusian economy including its oil 
products and potash sectors. 
Belarus opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya urged the EU to be "braver" and impose more sanctions against 
the Minsk regime. 
After meeting Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in The Hague, Tikhanovskaya said measures being discussed by 
EU countries to target Belarusian economic sectors did not go far enough. 
"Now we have to be stronger, braver, and the European Union has to be stronger, braver in its resolutions and its 
decisions," the exiled Belarusian opposition chief told reporters. 
EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Friday warned Lukashenko that "it is time to change course", saying: "No amount 
of repression, brutality or coercion will bring any legitimacy to your authoritarian regime." 
The European Commission president also wrote to the opposition offering a three-billion-euro package to support "a 
democratic Belarus" if Lukashenko steps down. 
Estonia called meanwhile for a stop to the "flow of money" to Lukashenko. 
Lukashenko has retained his grip on power in ex-Soviet Belarus since 1994 by hounding opponents, jailing and 
allegedly torturing dissidents, and muzzling independent media.

Putin Hosts Lukashenko Amid Western Outcry Over Plane
Russia and Belarus have formed a "union state" that links their economies and militaries but the Kremlin has been 
pushing for a closer integration. 
Over the past years Lukashenko has had a volatile relationship with Moscow, playing it off against the West and 
ruling out outright unification with Russia. 
But after the Ryanair plane incident Lukashenko's options appear to be limited.

democratic Belarus" if Lukashenko steps down. 
Lukashenko has retained his grip on power in ex-Soviet Belarus since 1994 by hounding opponents, jailing and 
allegedly torturing dissidents, and muzzling independent media.

 Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarus strongman Alexander Lukashenko will meet Friday after the UN civil 
aviation agency announced it will investigate the diversion of a passenger plane and the arrest of a journalist on 
board in a growing diplomatic row. 
The meeting in Sochi between the Kremlin and the Belarusian leader, who enjoys strong support from Moscow, 
comes as airlines revealed Russia has blocked some European flights for avoiding Belarus airspace.

The G7 global powers have demanded Belarus release the journalist, Roman Protasevich, and the EU's foreign 
policy chief threatened hard-hitting economic sanctions. 
The Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council said it had "decided to undertake a 
fact-finding investigation of this event".

It added the body "underlined the importance of establishing the facts of what happened, and of understanding 
whether there had been any breach by any ICAO Member State of international aviation law." 
Lukashenko sparked international outrage by dispatching a fighter jet Sunday to intercept a Ryanair flight from 
Athens to Vilnius carrying Protasevich, 26, and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, 23. 
A nervous-looking Protasevich was last seen in a video released by Belarusian authorities on Monday in which he 
was seen supposedly admitting to helping to organise mass unrest, a charge that could land him 15 years in jail.

 "I want you to relay our appeal everywhere, throughout the world, to government representatives, to EU countries, 
to EU leaders, to US leaders: I am appealing, I am begging, help me free my son," his mother Natalia told 
journalists in Warsaw, visibly moved. 
His father Dmitry said his son was "a tough man" and "a hero", adding: "Throughout his life he fought for the truth 
and passed it on to people, which is why Lukashenko committed this despicable act."

Putin And Lukashenko To Meet After Belarus Plane Diversion
Foreign ministers of the Group of Seven wealthy nations on Thursday demanded the "immediate and unconditional 
release" of Protasevich, "as well as all other journalists and political prisoners held in Belarus", in a joint statement 
published by the British government. 
The European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said proposals were "on the table" to target key sectors of 
the Belarusian economy.

He mooted targeting the potash fertiliser sector or refusing gas being delivered to the bloc via Belarus over the 
"hijacking" of the plane by the regime. 
Borrell was echoed by German Foreign Minister Heiko Mass, who also raised the possibility of hitting key firms in 
the fertiliser sector and said the EU could curb the Belarusian government's ability to issue bonds in Europe. 
But he played down the likelihood of the bloc agreeing quickly to reject gas transiting through pipelines in Belarus, 
insisting it was "more of a medium and long-term issue".

CHANNEL NEVOLF / -  
The bloc was also looking at "targeted sanctions" against the Belarusian authorities to add to the 88 regime figures 
and seven companies already on a blacklist over a brutal crackdown on the opposition after last year's disputed 
presidential election. 
At a Thursday briefing in Vilnius, where she fled after last year's election, exiled Belarusian opposition leader 
Svetlana Tikhanovskaya called for an "economic boycott of the regime". 
Christophe Deloire, head of media rights watchdog Reporters Sans Frontieres (Reporters Without Borders) was 
also in Lithuania to file a legal complaint against Lukashenko with prosecutors investigating Sunday's incident. 
Lukashenko still enjoys solid support from Putin, with the Kremlin website describing "integration" between the two 
nations as "a long-term cherished project for Moscow" ahead of their meeting at the Russian leader's summer 
residence in Sochi. 
The ICAO, of which Belarus is a member, has no power to order sanctions and Russia's support for Minsk means 
the UN Security Council is unlikely to agree on a collective statement. 
However EU nations are banning Belarusian carriers and the EU has also urged airlines to avoid the country's 
airspace. 
On Thursday, Austrian Airlines said it had cancelled a Vienna-Moscow flight after Russian authorities did not 
approve a route change avoiding Belarusian airspace. 
An Air France flight from Paris to Moscow on Wednesday had to be cancelled for the same reason. 
A defiant Lukashenko said he had "acted lawfully to protect our people" from an alleged bomb threat on the plane, 
in a parliament address Wednesday. 
The criticism was nothing more than another attempt by his opponents to undermine his rule, he added. 
Lukashenko -- often dubbed "Europe's last dictator" -- is facing some of the strongest international pressure of his 
nearly 27 years ruling ex-Soviet Belarus. 
He and his allies are already under a series of Western sanctions over a crackdown on protests after his disputed 
re-election to a sixth term last August.

Russia Throws Weight Behind Lukashenko Ahead Of Putin Talks

 Russia on Friday threw its weight behind Belarus's increasingly isolated regime, slamming a European overflight 
ban as President Vladimir Putin prepared to host strongman Alexander Lukashenko. 
The meeting is an important show of support for the authoritarian Belarusian leader who is facing a global outcry 
after he forced a Ryanair jet to land in Minsk last Sunday and arrested an opposition activist onboard. 
The European Union in response urged carriers based in the bloc to divert flights from Belarusian airspace and 
promised a fresh wave of sanctions against Lukashenko and regime officials. 
The overflight ban has led to several cancellations of flights between Russia and Europe, after Russian authorities 
rejected flight plans that would have skipped Belarusian airspace. 
Air France for the second time this week had to cancel a flight from Paris to Moscow on Friday, after Austrian 
Airlines did the same for a Vienna-to-Moscow flight on Thursday.

year, will meet for the first time since Belarus forced a Ryanair jet to land in Minsk and arrested an opposition 
activist onboard. Photo: Sputnik / Alexei Druzhinin  
Russia insists the cancellations are purely "technical", but they have raised concerns that Russia could be 
systematically refusing to let European airlines land if they avoid Belarus. 
With the Putin-Lukashenko talks due later Friday in Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi, Moscow hit out at the flight 
ban as politically motivated and dangerous. 
 "What the West has done... for political reasons is completely irresponsible and endangers the safety of 
passengers," Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. 
"It is time for Brussels to learn how to take effective measures to protect citizens against real, not imaginary, 
threats," she said.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc was monitoring whether this was a broader policy from Russia, 
but the Kremlin insisted the disruptions were in no way political. 
"Aviation authorities will give the necessary explanations, but these are technical reasons," Kremlin spokesman 
Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 
Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency said that changes of previously approved routes could result in delays in 
obtaining arrival, departure or transit permits. 
Russia Throws Weight Behind Lukashenko Ahead Of Putin Talks
Putin and Lukashenko have continued to meet regularly since last August, when the Belarusian leader faced 
historic protests against his nearly three-decade rule over a disputed election. 
The meetings are often held behind closed doors and without comments to the press. 
 Minsk said it demanded the flight land in Minsk based on a message that it said was sent from a ProtonMail, but 
the company said the message was sent after the plane was re-routed. Photo: ONLINER.BY / -  
Lukashenko waged a ruthless crackdown on his opponents -- with thousands arrested -- and has leaned 
increasingly on Putin amid condemnation from the West. 
Sunday's flight diversion was a dramatic escalation, with EU leaders accusing Minsk of essentially hijacking a 
European flight to arrest 26-year-old opposition activist Roman Protasevich. 
Belarus authorities claimed to have received a bomb threat against the Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius carrying 
the dissident journalist. 
Minsk said it scambled a jet and demanded the flight land in Minsk based on the message it said was sent from a 
ProtonMail address by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. 
But Proton Technologies, which is based in Geneva and says it is the world's largest secure email provider, said the 
message had been sent after the plane had already been diverted. 
"We can see the sent time and can confirm it was after the plane was redirected," it said on Twitter. 
The Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council announced on Thursday it was 
launching an investigation, amid calls for Belarus to be banned from international air agencies. 
Protasevich, who helped organise historic demonstrations against Lukashenko's long rule last year, was arrested 
along with his Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega, 23, after the plane landed in Minsk. 
Both Protasevich and Sapega have since appeared in confession videos that their supporters said were recorded 
under duress and are a common tactic of the regime to pressure critics. 
Western leaders have demanded their release and warned of serious consequences. 
Borrell has said proposals are "on the table" to target key sectors of the Belarusian economy including its oil 
products and potash sectors. 
EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Friday warned Lukashenko "it is time to change course", saying: "No amount of 
repression, brutality or coercion will bring any legitimacy to your authoritarian regime." 
The European Commission president also wrote to the opposition offering a three-billion-euro package in support to 
"a democratic Belarus" if Lukashenko leaves power. 
Lukashenko has retained his grip on power in ex-Soviet Belarus since 1994 by hounding opponents, jailing and 
allegedly torturing dissidents, and muzzling independent media. 
The 66-year-old moved swiftly against his opponents in the wake of presidential elections last year in which he 
claimed a sixth term, jailing or forcing into exile his primary challengers.

Two European airlines had to cancel flights to Moscow after Russian authorities failed to approve new routes that 
avoided Belarus's airspace in response to Minsk's interception of a passenger jet.
Air France and Austrian Airlines sought to reroute flights that would normally fly over Belarus when EU 
governments demanded that their airlines avoid the country's airspace. The EU was acting in response to the 
interception of Ryanair flight 4978 by Belarusian authorities on Sunday in order to detain an opposition activist.
Air France and Austrian Airlines said Russian aviation authorities had not approved the new routes, leading to the 
cancellation of a flight from Paris to Moscow on Wednesday, and from Vienna to Moscow yesterday.
An Air France flight to Russia today was still awaiting permission to use a new route avoiding Belarus. However, 
several other European carriers, including KLM and a British Airways cargo flight, have been allowed to land in 
Russia using new flight routes. The Kremlin did not comment and referred inquiries to aviation authorities.
Industry insiders have grown concerned about the politicisation of airspace after the Ryanair flight from Athens to 
Vilnius was forced to land in Minsk because of an alleged bomb threat. Two of the 126 passengers, antiregime 
activist Roman Protasevich and his Russian partner, were arrested after the plane landed. However, the supposed

bomb threat cited by Belarusian authorities was sent in an email after the plane was diverted, according to email 
provider Proton Technologies.
"We cannot access or verify the contents of the message. However ... we can confirm that the message in question 
was sent after the plane was redirected," the company said.
Ryanair has labelled the forced landing an act of "aviation piracy", and the UK and EU have urged their airlines to 
avoid Belarusian airspace, banned the state-owned carrier from their airports, and vowed to impose fresh economic 
sanctions on the regime. The US has requested the immediate release of Protasevich and his partner.
However, Russia has backed Minsk, calling the EU's reaction "hysteric". Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, and 
Alexander Lukashenko, Belarus president, are due to meet today in Russia.
Willie Walsh, head of the International Air Transport Association, has said it is "disturbing" to see a flight diverted 
"for clearly bogus reasons".
EU foreign ministers held initial talks yesterday on punitive measures against Belarus's regime, with the country's 
lucrative potash sector high on the agenda. The European bloc will target economic structures and financial 
transactions in Belarus "significantly", Heiko Maas, Germany's foreign minister, said ahead of the Lisbon gathering.

 Belarus 'Hijacks' Ryanair Flight to Arrest Lukashenko Critic 
A Newark-bound Air India flight returned midway to Delhi on Thursday after a pilot reported the presence of a bat 
inside the plane.

Since diverting an EU airliner with a military jet and arresting the opposition activist it carried, President Alexander 
Lukashenko has attracted western outrage and threats of economic sanctions, further isolating landlocked Belarus.
On Wednesday, the Belarusian strongman made clear it was worth it.
In his first comments since the forced landing of Vilnius-bound Ryanair flight 4978 in Minsk and the detention of 
Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega, his Russian girlfriend, he warned it was only a "matter of time" before other 
dissidents abroad would be caught too.
"We know you by sight," said the 66-year-old former collective farm boss.
Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus for 27 years, was an international pariah after he declared victory in last 
summer's election and cracked down on peaceful protests against his regime.
On Tuesday, Brussels barred Belarus from EU airspace and is considering sanctions against sectors of its export 
market. With most land borders closed and the skies empty, Belarusians have few ways to leave other than through 
Russia, which has stood by Lukashenko.

But the interception shows that despite international pressure after months of suppressing protests, Lukashenko 
feels stronger, said Maryia Rohava, an Oslo university researcher.
"The fact that they feel they can carry out this sort of atrocious act without fearing the consequences is a sign they 
feel very secure in the backing of Russia, in their own domestic situation, and in the EU's lack of credible 
commitment to imposing the kind of sanctions that would hurt the regime," she said.
"In the environment in which they function, calculation of the costs was not even part of the puzzle."
For a brief moment last August, it looked as if the regime was about to col-
Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets every Sunday to protest at the election result, while workers at 
a factory thought to employ Lukashenko's political base booed him when he came to make a speech.
Lukashenko clung to power by tightening control of the media, sending riot police to disperse protests violently and 
arresting dissidents, many of whom say they were tortured in custody. By the winter, the weekly protests fizzled out.
Viasna, a Belarusian human rights association, said the country of 9.5m had 421 political prisoners, so many that 
guards in some detention centres had forced them to wear yellow tags.
"The underlying reasons for these protests have not gone away. The grievances are just as significant as they 
were," said Nigel Gould-Davies, a former UK ambassador to Minsk and now senior fellow at the International 
Institute for Strategic Studies. "It's just that the authorities at the moment have learnt how to intimidate open and 
visible manifestations of that discontent."
After Protasevich's arrest, the authorities leaked videos of the blogger confessing to "organising mass 
disturbances", an offence that carries a jail sentence of up to 15 years. Protasevich's father told Reuters his son's 
nose appeared to be broken and he believed the admission of guilt had been forced.
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Belarus's exiled opposition leader, tweeted that the video of Protasevich, 26, and a 
similar leaked confession by Sapega, 23, were "terrifying" and an attempt to "[terrorise] the whole country".
On Wednesday, in an apparent attempt to intimidate, authorities released footage of what are thought to be the final 
hours of the life of Vitold Ashurak, a dissident. The clip showed Ashurak, 50, who died on May 21 of unknown 
causes, alone in a cell, and collapsing twice, face first.
On Tuesday, Dmitry Stakhovsky, 18, an orphan, died by suicide after being charged with similar crimes to 
Protasevich and blamed "moral pressure" from investigators, according to a social media post.
"It's a logical continuation of what we've seen in the past few months. Nobody stops the repressions, there's no 
reason to, and they continue," said Artyom Shraibman, a Minsk-based nonresident fellow at the Carnegie Moscow 
Center. "Society isn't rising up again and the new sanctions have all been completely unserious so far. So why 
should he stop?"
Protasevich's arrest showed Lukashenko was more willing to pursue dissidents abroad, Shraibman said. Russia's 
FSB arrested two opposition figures in Moscow and handed them over to Minsk's KGB in April. Shortly afterwards, 
a top Belarusian security official vowed to "find and purge" those responsible for the August protests. The EU has

Ties between Vladimir Putin and Lukashenko are strained but the Russian president has offered Belarus billions of

"There's no way he'll soften his stance without getting Russia involved in the process, or raising the costs of this for

Merkel has dealt authoritarians a trump card

V ladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko are not natural soulmates. The Russian president finds his fellow 
autocrat in Belarus a wilful ally. What unites the two leaders is a determination to hold on to power whatever the 
cost by way of ruthless repression of political opposition.
They also share the same perception of the west in general and Europe in particular. However much western 
democracies may huff and puff about upholding international rules and norms, they are essentially flabby and weak.
Flagrant violations of international law may sometimes stir the EU into action. But sanctions invariably fall short of 
the real economic pain that would change the Kremlin's cost-benefit analysis. And reprisals can be put to a 
purpose. Putin's nationalism casts Russia as forever under threat from western aggression. Sanctions fit the 
narrative.
This is the calculation that informed Russia's annexation of Crimea and its occupation of territory in eastern 
Ukraine. It emboldens Moscow in its support for Bashar al-Assad in Syria, in the murder of regime opponents living 
abroad and the arrest of Alexei Navalny at home. It also encourages Russian meddling in western elections and 
cyber attacks directed by the Kremlin.
It is a comfortable bet that Lukashenko shared the assumption of impunity when he ordered the hijacking of a 
Ryanair passenger jet in order to kidnap the dissident journalist Roman Protasevich. On the evidence of Europe's 
response so far, he was probably right.
Merkel has dealt authoritarians a trump card
The EU's answer to this flagrant air piracy has been to advise airlines to avoid overflying Belarus and to bar the 
state carrier Belavia from European airports. Key regime figures may also face travel bans and asset freezes. 
Inconvenient? Yes. A threat to Lukashenko's hold on power? Scarcely.
It is unclear whether Putin gave his explicit backing. European diplomats say he was almost certainly kept informed. 
Either way, EU sanctions will now fix Lukashenko more firmly in the Russian camp.
The EU is never going to find it easy to reach agreement on sanctions. Its 27 members have different interests and 
different histories. Germany, Italy and
France pay close attention to the economic opportunities in Russia. For Poland and the Baltic states, security is 
uppermost. Germany's Angela Merkel, however, has also dealt the autocrats a trump card.
Few can match Merkel in her rhetorical devotion to the rules-based international system. Putin's ambitions are 
entirely antithetical. He wants a return to the spheres of influence of great power politics. Doubtless, the German 
chancellor is sincere in her conviction. Germany has prospered greatly from multilateralism. And yet. She is almost 
always the voice of caution when the conversation turns to enforcing the rules.
In part, this may have sometime to do with timing. She reached office quite soon after the US had gone to war in 
Afghanistan and Iraq - scarcely the best advertisement for bold intervention to uphold the international order. There 
is also temperament. Like many of a centrist disposition, she can mix up moderation and vacillation.
That said, Merkel takes seriously her role as a champion for German industry. Foreign policy must be carefully 
calibrated to avoid damaging the country's legendary export performance.
Thus Berlin took the lead in pushing through the EU's recent investment agreement with China in spite of Beijing's 
growing disdain for international rules. Closer to home, fellow EU member Hungary has become a pivotal 
manufacturing hub for Germany's automo- bile industry. Its prime minister, Viktor Orban, is marching the country 
towards authoritarianism. Merkel has consistently applied a brake on EU action to uphold Hungarian democracy.
With Russia, the test for Merkel is the pipeline under the Baltic to bring Russian gas to Germany. Nord Stream 2 is 
nearing completion. It promises at once to undercut the EU's joint energy policy, to offer strategic economic security 
to the Kremlin and to weaken Ukraine. Scrapping the project would show serious intent on the part of the west to 
uphold a law-based order. It would also impose significant cost on German businesses. By ignoring the entreaties 
of the US and many European governments to call a halt, Merkel is setting a clear limit on Europe's response to 
Kremlin lawlessness. Putin can do as he pleases in the knowledge the EU's reaction will be constrained by Berlin. 
Sanctions may sting, but they will not wound. Merkel cannot complain if others see her as the autocrats' ally.

May 27, 2021( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 The UN civil aviation agency announced Thursday it will investigate Belarus's diversion of a Ryanair plane and the 
arrest of a journalist on board, as airlines revealed Russia has blocked some European flights in a growing 
diplomatic row. 
 The G7 global powers also demanded Minsk release the journalist, Roman Protasevich, and the EU's foreign 
policy chief threatened hard-hitting economic sanctions. 
 The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council, based in Montreal, 'decided to undertake a fact-
finding investigation of this event,' it said in a statement. 
 It added that, at a meeting, the body 'underlined the importance of establishing the facts of what happened, and of 
understanding whether there had been any breach by any ICAO Member State of international aviation law.' 
 Belarus's strongman President Alexander Lukashenko, who enjoys strong support from Moscow, sparked 
international outrage by dispatching a fighter jet Sunday to intercept a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilniuscarrying 
Protasevich, 26, and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, 23. 
 A nervous-looking Protasevich was last seen in a video released by Belarusian authorities on Monday in which he 
was seen supposedly admitting to helping to organise mass unrest, a charge that could land him in jail for 15 years. 
 'I want you to relay our appeal everywhere, throughout the world, to government representatives, to EU countries, 
to EU leaders, to US leaders: I am appealing, I am begging, help me free my son,' his mother Natalia told 
journalists in Warsaw, visibly moved. 
 Roman's father, Dmitry on Thursday said his son was 'a tough man' and 'a hero'. 
 'Throughout his life he fought for the truth and passed it on to people, which is why Lukashenko committed this 
despicable act,' he said. 
 The couple and their lawyer confirmed that they have not had any communication with their son since his arrest. 
 - 'Immediate and unconditional release' - 
 Foreign ministers of the Group of Seven wealthy nations on Thursday demanded the 'immediate and unconditional 
release' of Protasevich, 'as well as all other journalists and political prisoners held in Belarus', in a joint statement 
published by the British government. 
 The European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Thursday that proposals were 'on the table' to target 
key sectors of the Belarusian economy. 
UN aviation body to launch probe into Belarus plane diversion
 Borrell mooted targeting the potash fertiliser sector or refusing gas being delivered to the bloc via Belarus over the 
'hijacking' of the plane by the regime. 
 He was echoed by German Foreign Minister Heiko Mass, who also raised the possibility of hitting key firms in the 
fertiliser sector and said the EU could curb the Belarusian government's ability to issue bonds in Europe. 
 But he played down the likelihood of the bloc agreeing quickly to reject gas transiting through pipelines in Belarus, 
insisting it was 'more of a medium and long-term issue'. 
 The bloc was also looking at 'targeted sanctions' against the Belarusian authorities to add to the 88 regime figures 
and seven companies already on a blacklist over a brutal crackdown on the opposition after last year's disputed 
presidential election. 
 At a briefing in Vilnius, where she fled to after last year's election, exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana 
Tikhanovskaya on Thursday called for an 'economic boycott of the regime'. 
 Christophe Deloire, the head of media rights watchdog Reporters Sans Frontieres (Reporters Without Borders) 
was also in Lithuania to file a legal complaint against Lukashenko with prosecutors investigating Sunday's incident. 
 Later on Thursday he protested on the Belarusian border along with dozens of Belarusian and Lithuanian 
journalists. 
 - Air links cut - 
 The ICAO, of which Belarus is a member, has no power to order sanctions and Russia's support for Minsk means 
the UN Security Council is unlikely to agree on a collective statement. 
 However EU countries are banning Belarusian carriers and theEU has also urged airlines to avoid Belarusian 
airspace. 
 On Thursday, Austrian Airlines said it had cancelled a Vienna-Moscow flight after Russian authorities did not 
approve a route change for it to avoid Belarusian airspace. 
 An Air France flight from Paris to Moscow on Wednesday had to be cancelled for the same reason. 
 - 'Europe's last dictator' - 
 A defiant Lukashenko said he had 'acted lawfully to protect our people' from an alleged bomb threat on the plane, 
in an address to parliament on Wednesday. 
 The criticism was nothing more than another attempt by his opponents to undermine his rule, he added. 
 Lukashenko — often dubbed 'Europe's last dictator' — is facing some of the strongestinternational pressure of his 
nearly 27 years ruling ex-Soviet Belarus. 
 He and his allies are already under a series of Western sanctions over a brutal crackdown on mass protests that 
followed his disputed re-election to a sixth term last August. 
 But he continues to enjoy solid support from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is hosting the Belarusian leader 
on Friday.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) said the pilot of the flight recently forced to land in Minsk, Belarus, was 
refused permission to contact the airline before diverting the aircraft, Reuters reported Friday.
The report, which cited a letter seen by the news agency, said Belarusian authorities used the threat of a bomb 
alert, which turned out to be false, to divert the plane and arrest a dissident journalist who was on board. 
The letter, signed by Chief Executive Michael O'Leary, said the flight was "unlawfully diverted [as] Minsk ATC 
refused to contact Ryanair, falsely claimed that Ryanair Ops would not answer the phone."
Shares in Ryanair were marginally higher on Friday afternoon.

 After departing No. 10 through the front door in November 2020, Dominic Cummings was never going to disappear 
from the political limelight quietly. 
A select committee appearance this week saw the former No. 10 adviser make a series of incendiary claims[1] 
about the government's pandemic response, including allegations that Health Secretary Matt Hancock should have 
been 'fired for at least 15, 20 things[2], including lying to everybody on multiple occasions'. 
Hancock has denied Cummings's allegations[3], insisting that he was 'straight with people in public and in private' 
and describing the attacks against him as 'unsubstantiated' during an appearance in the House of Commons. 
However, Boris Johnson's former right-hand man[4] claims to have kept the receipts from his time working in 
Downing Street, meaning the select committee appearance may be just the beginning of a clash with his former 
boss[5]. 
To find out how closely you've been paying attention to the latest developments in the pandemic, and other global 
events, put your knowledge to the test with our Quiz of The Week:

Away from Westminster, the UK's first rehabilitation centre for sufferers of long Covid[6] opened its doors as 
speculation continues to mount about whether the spread of the India variant[7] will delay the final step in England's 
route out of restrictions[8]. 
The forced emergency landing of a Ryanair passenger jet in Belarus[9] led to the arrest of a dissident journalist and 
prompted a muted response from the eastern European nation's closest allies[10] in Moscow. 
A grand jury was convinced in New York to consider potential criminal charges against former president Donald 
Trump[11], his associates and his businesses.And in Syria, Bashar al-Assad won a fourth term following a 'sham 
election'[12] in which the presidentwon 95.1% of the vote.

Lukashenko amid a global outcry following the forced diversion of a European plane. 
 Observers will watch the negotiations to see how far Russia goes to support Lukashenko's regime after Belarus 
scrambled a Mig jet to divert a Ryanair jet and arrest an opposition journalist onboard last Sunday. 
 Following the Ryanair plane's forced diversion, the European Union urged EU-based carriers to avoid Belarusian 
airspace and promised fresh sanctions against Lukashenko and regime officials. 
 Putin warmly greeted Lukashenko in Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi, saying he was 'very glad' to see him and 
the two should go for a swim. 
 'We've been building the Union State,' Putin told Lukashenko at the start of the talks. 'We are confidently moving in 
that direction, that work is already bringing concrete results to our citizens,' he added. 
 Lukashenko complained that the West was seeking to stir unrest in Belarus. 
 'An attempt is under way to rock the boat to reach the level of last August,' Lukashenko said, referring to the 
outbreak of protests against his regime following a disputed election. 
 'It's clear what these Western friends want from us.' 
 The Belarus strongman, who arrived with a briefcase, said he wanted to show Putin 'some documents' related to 
the Ryanair incident and thanked him for his support in the latest standoff with the West. 
 In carefully worded remarks in front of reporters, Putin said that when then-Bolivian President Evo Morales's plane 
was grounded in 2013 there was little Western outcry. 
 'The president was led out of the plane, and nothing, silence,' Putin said. 
 A plane carrying Morales from Moscow was diverted and held up in Vienna for hours amid suspicions fugitive US 
whistleblower Edward Snowden was on board. 
 Putin and Lukashenko have met regularly since August, when historic protests broke out against Lukashenko's 
nearly three-decade rule following a disputed election. 
 Lukashenko, 66, waged a ruthless crackdown on his opponents and has leaned increasingly on Putin amid 
condemnation from the West. 
 Several people died during the unrest in Belarus, thousands were detained, and hundreds reported torture in 
prison. 
Putin praises closer ties with Belarus in Lukashenko talks
 Sunday's flight diversion was a dramatic escalation, with EU leaders accusing Minsk of essentially hijacking a 
European flight to arrest 26-year-old opposition journalist and activist Roman Protasevich. 
 - 'Technical reasons' - 
 The overflight ban has led to several cancellations of flights between Russia and Europe, after Russian authorities 
rejected flight plans that would have skipped Belarusian airspace. 
 Russia insists the cancellations are purely 'technical', but they have raised concerns that Russia could be 
systematically refusing to let European airlines land if they avoid Belarus. 
 Moscow hit out at the flight ban as politically motivated and dangerous. 
 'What the West has done for political reasons is completely irresponsible and endangers the safety of passengers,' 
said Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. 
 EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc was monitoring whether this was a broader policy from Russia, 
but the Kremlin insisted the disruptions were in no way political. 
 'Aviation authorities will give the necessary explanations, but these are technical reasons,' Kremlin spokesman 
Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 
 Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency said changes of previously approved routes could result in delays in 
obtaining arrival, departure or transit permits. 
 Belarus authorities claimed to have received a bomb threat against the Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius 
carrying the dissident. 
 Minsk said it scrambled a combat jet and demanded the flight land in Minsk based on the message it said was sent 
from a ProtonMail address by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. 
 - 'Have to be braver' - 
 But Proton Technologies, which is based in Geneva, said the message was sent after the plane had already been 
diverted. 
 'We can see the sent time and can confirm it was after the plane was redirected,' it said on Twitter. 
 The Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council announced Thursday it was launching 
an investigation, amid calls for Belarus to be banned from international air agencies. 
 Protasevich, who helped organise historic demonstrations against Lukashenko's rule last year, was arrested along 
with Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega, 23, after the plane landed in Minsk. 
 Both Protasevich and Sapega have since appeared in confession videos that their supporters said were recorded 
under duress and are a common tactic of the regime to pressure critics. 
 Borrell has said proposals are 'on the table' to target key sectors of the Belarusian economy including its oil 
products and potash sectors. 
 Belarus opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya urged the EU to be 'braver' and impose more sanctions against 
the Minsk regime. 
 After meeting Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in The Hague, Tikhanovskaya said measures being discussed by 
EU countries to target Belarusian economic sectors did not go far enough. 
 'Now we have to be stronger, braver, and the European Union has to be stronger, braver in its resolutions and its 
decisions,' the exiled Belarusian opposition chief told reporters. 
 EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Friday warned Lukashenko that 'it is time to change course', saying: 'No amount 
of repression, brutality or coercion will bring any legitimacy to your authoritarian regime.' 
 The European Commission president also wrote to the opposition offering a three-billion-euro package to support 
'a democratic Belarus' if Lukashenko steps down. 
 Estonia called meanwhile for a stop to the 'flow of money' to Lukashenko. 
 Lukashenko has retained his grip on power in ex-Soviet Belarus since 1994 by hounding opponents, jailing and 
allegedly torturing dissidents, and muzzling independent media.

 President Vladimir Putin praised Russia's close ties with Belarus on Friday as he hosted strongman Alexander 
Lukashenko amid a global outcry following the forced diversion of a European plane. 
 Observers closely watched the talks to see how far the Kremlin would go to support Lukashenko's regime after 
Belarus scrambled a military jet to divert a Ryanair plane and arrest an opposition journalist onboard last Sunday. 
 Following the Ryanair plane's forced diversion, the European Union urged EU-based carriers to avoid Belarusian 
airspace and promised fresh sanctions against Lukashenko and regime officials. 
 During talks in Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi, Putin warmly greeted Lukashenko and agreed with him that the 
Western outcry over the plane was an 'outburst of emotion'. 
 Putin said he was 'very glad' to see Lukashenko and the two should go for a swim. 
 In carefully worded remarks in front of reporters, Putin also said that when then-Bolivian President Evo Morales's 
plane was grounded in 2013 there was little Western outcry. 
 'The president was led out of the plane, and nothing, silence,' Putin said at the start of the talks.

 The Belarus strongman, who arrived with a briefcase, said he wanted to show Putin 'some documents' related to 
the Ryanair incident and thanked him for his support in the latest standoff with the West. 
 The talks lasted for more than five hours but their results were not announced. 
 The two leaders praised growing bilateral cooperation. 
 'We've been building the Union State,' Putin told Lukashenko. 
 'We are confidently moving in that direction, that work is already bringing concrete results to our citizens.' 
 Russia and Belarus have formed a 'union state' that links their economies and militaries but the Kremlin has been 
pushing for a closer integration. 
Putin hosts Lukashenko amid Western outcry over plane
 Over the past years Lukashenko has had a volatile relationship with Moscow, playing it off against the West and 
ruling out outright unification with Russia. 
 But after the Ryanair plane incident Lukashenko's options appear to be limited. 
 Putin and Lukashenko have met regularly since August, when historic protests broke out against Lukashenko's 
nearly three-decade rule following a disputed election. 
 The 66-year-old Belarus strongman waged a ruthless crackdown on his opponents and has leaned increasingly on

 Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarus strongman Alexander Lukashenko will meet Friday after the UN civil 
aviation agency announced it will investigatethe diversion of a passenger plane and the arrest of a journalist on 
board in a growing diplomatic row. 
 The meeting in Sochi between the Kremlin and the Belarusian leader, who enjoys strong support from Moscow, 
comes as airlines revealed Russia has blocked some European flights for avoiding Belarus airspace. 
 The G7 global powers have demanded Belarus release the journalist, Roman Protasevich, and the EU's foreign 
policy chief threatened hard-hitting economic sanctions. 
 The Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council said it had 'decided to undertake a 
fact-finding investigation of this event'. 
 It added the body 'underlined the importance of establishing the facts of what happened, and of understanding 
whether there had been any breach by any ICAO Member State of international aviation law.' 
 Lukashenko sparked international outrage by dispatching a fighter jet Sunday to intercept a Ryanair flight from 
Athens to Vilniuscarrying Protasevich, 26, and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, 23. 
 A nervous-looking Protasevich was last seen in a video released by Belarusian authorities on Monday in which he 
was seen supposedly admitting to helping to organise mass unrest, a charge that could land him 15 years in jail. 
 'I want you to relay our appeal everywhere, throughout the world, to government representatives, to EU countries, 
to EU leaders, to US leaders: I am appealing, I am begging, help me free my son,' his mother Natalia told 
journalists in Warsaw, visibly moved. 
 His father Dmitry said his son was 'a tough man' and 'a hero', adding: 'Throughout his life he fought for the truth 
and passed it on to people, which is why Lukashenko committed this despicable act.' 
 The couple and their lawyer confirmed they have not had any communication with Protasevich since his arrest. 
 - 'Immediate and unconditional release' - 
 Foreign ministers of the Group of Seven wealthy nations on Thursday demanded the 'immediate and unconditional 
release' of Protasevich, 'as well as all other journalists and political prisoners held in Belarus', in a joint statement 
published by the British government. 
 The European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said proposals were 'on the table' to target key sectors of 
the Belarusian economy. 
Putin and Lukashenko to meet after Belarus plane diversion
 He mooted targeting the potash fertiliser sector or refusing gas being delivered to the bloc via Belarus over the 
'hijacking' of the plane by the regime. 
 Borrell was echoed by German Foreign Minister Heiko Mass, who also raised the possibility of hitting key firms in 
the fertiliser sector and said the EU could curb the Belarusian government's ability to issue bonds in Europe. 
 But he played down the likelihood of the bloc agreeing quickly to reject gas transiting through pipelines in Belarus, 
insisting it was 'more of a medium and long-term issue'. 
 The bloc was also looking at 'targeted sanctions' against the Belarusian authorities to add to the 88 regime figures 
and seven companies already on a blacklist over a brutal crackdown on the opposition after last year's disputed 
presidential election. 
 At a Thursday briefing in Vilnius, where she fled after last year's election, exiled Belarusian opposition leader 
Svetlana Tikhanovskaya called for an 'economic boycott of the regime'. 
 Christophe Deloire, head of media rights watchdog Reporters Sans Frontieres (Reporters Without Borders) was 
also in Lithuania to file a legal complaint against Lukashenko with prosecutors investigating Sunday's incident. 
 Lukashenko still enjoys solid support from Putin, with the Kremlin website describing 'integration' between the two 
nations as 'a long-term cherished project for Moscow' ahead of their meeting at the Russian leader's summer 
residence in Sochi. 
 - Air links cut - 
 The ICAO, of which Belarus is a member, has no power to order sanctions and Russia's support for Minsk means 
the UN Security Council is unlikely to agree on a collective statement. 
 However EU nations are banning Belarusian carriers and theEU has also urged airlines to avoid the country's 
airspace. 
 On Thursday, Austrian Airlines said it had cancelled a Vienna-Moscow flight after Russian authorities did not 
approve a route change avoiding Belarusian airspace. 
 An Air France flight from Paris to Moscow on Wednesday had to be cancelled for the same reason. 
 - 'Europe's last dictator' - 
 A defiant Lukashenko said he had 'acted lawfully to protect our people' from an alleged bomb threat on the plane, 
in a parliament address Wednesday. 
 The criticism was nothing more than another attempt by his opponents to undermine his rule, he added. 
 Lukashenko — often dubbed 'Europe's last dictator' — is facing some of the strongestinternational pressure of his 
nearly 27 years ruling ex-Soviet Belarus. 
 He and his allies are already under a series of Western sanctions over a crackdown on protests after his disputed 
re-election to a sixth term last August.

 Belarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko on Friday was in Russia for talks with President Vladimir Putin that 
are seen as a support for the increasingly isolated regime following the forced diversion of a European plane. 
 The high-profile talks began Friday evening and come as the authoritarian Belarusian leader faces a global outcry 
for forcing a Ryanair jet to land in Minsk last Sunday and arresting an opposition journalist onboard. 
 Observers will watch the negotiations in Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi to see how far Russia goes to support 
Lukashenko's regime. 
 Lukashenko's office said the two leaders would 'compare notes over the most pressing issues' on the agenda and 
discuss further steps to bring their two ex-Soviet countries closer.

airspace and promised fresh sanctions against Lukashenko and regime officials. 
 The overflight ban has led to several cancellations of flights between Russia and Europe, after Russian authorities

 Russia on Friday threw its weight behind Belarus's increasingly isolated regime, slamming a European overflight

 The meeting is an important show of support for the authoritarian Belarusian leader who is facing a global outcry

allegedly torturing dissidents, and muzzling independent media. 
 The 66-year-old moved swiftly against his opponents in the wake of presidential elections last year in which he 
claimed a sixth term, jailing or forcing into exile his primary challengers.

Belarus dictator threatens to 'flood EU with drugs and migrants' to avoid sanctions
Belarus dictator threatens to 'flood EU with drugs and migrants' to avoid

 Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has warned the EU that he will allow migrants and drugs to flood into 
western Europe if sanctions are imposed on his country following the forced landing of a Ryanair passenger plane. 
EU foreign ministers met in Lisbon yesterday to discuss economic measures that will 'target the former Soviet 
state's most important industries and its financial sector', The Times[1] reports. The 66-year-old dictator responded 
to the threat of sanctions by saying: 'We stopped drugs and migrants. Now you will eat them and catch them 
yourselves.' 
Belarus shares a border with Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, all of which are EU member states, as well as Ukraine 
and Russia, prompting Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte to warn: 'This is an unpredictable regime from 
which you can expect anything, and you have to be prepared for anything.' 
German Foreign Minister Heiko Mass said yesterdaythat Belarus will face 'a barrage of sanctions if it did not start 
releasing political prisoners[2]', Politico[3] says, including dissident journalist Roman Protasevich[4]and his partner 
who were detained on Monday. 
The sanctions are expected to first focus on 'individuals and companies close to Lukashenko's regime', but could be 
extended into 'an economic and financial crackdown on the regime if it doesnot change course', the news site adds. 
'Belarusian oil as well as potash' are likely to be the sectors that EU sanctions seek to target, The Times adds, as 
the eastern European nation currently 'meets about 25% of Europe's demand for the fertiliser'. 'The key word, I 
think, is potash,' Jean Asselborn, Luxembourg's foreign minister, said. 'I think it would hurt Lukashenko very much if 
we managed something in this area.' 
NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg today told Sky News[5] that 'we know the very close relationship 
between Russia and Belarus', adding that it is 'hard to believe that the regime in Minsk could do something like this 
without any kind of coordination with Russia'. 
Moscow denied any involvement in the forced landing of the Ryanair flight and was initially muted in its backing for 
Belarus[6]. But in a 'show of support for Lukashenko', Russia has now 'refused permission for Air France and 
Austrian Airlines aircraft to enter its airspace', The Times says. 
Belarus dictator threatens to 'flood EU with drugs and migrants' to avoid sanctions
'Austria and other countries fear that an economic blockade could push Belarus even closer to Russia[7],'the paper 
adds. However, Lukashenko has sought to play down the impact of any sanctions, saying 'we'll substitute Europe, 
which is growing mercilessly old, for rapidly growing Asia'.

Lithuania wants to host the European Track Cycling Championships, which were stripped from Minsk in reaction to 
the forced landing of a passenger plane by Belarus.
European cycling body UEC took the June 23-27 event off Belarus after a Ryanair plane was forced to land in 
Minsk on Sunday and government critic Roman Protasevich was arrested on board.
"Infrastructure, experience, friendly fans and financial contribution - this is our pledge to UEC cycling and the 
athletes of 50 cycling federations," tweeted Lithuania Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte.
In a reply, the UEC showed an open mind tweeting: "Dear Prime Minister we would be delighted to develop your 
proposition."

Belarus' Lukashenko meeting with Putin to discuss Western sanctions

Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, who's under increasing pressure from the West and EU sanctions, is 
heading to Russia on Friday to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The two leaders will discuss further developing their countries' ties when they get together in the Black Sea resort of 
Sochi, according to the Kremlin. Friday's meeting will be the third between the two leaders already this year.
Lukashenko says that he will also discuss the consequences of EU and US sanctions, which are currently hitting 
Belarus especially hard.
Minsk already owes Moscow billions, but Putin has recently repeatedly emphasized that the Kremlin would continue 
to support Lukashenko.
The meeting is taking place less than a week after Belarus forced a passenger plane to make an emergency 
landing in Minsk, saying there was a bomb threat aboard, which turned out to be an unfounded claim, and sending 
a fighter jet to accompany the Ryanair flight.
Roman Protasevich, a 26-year-old dissident journalist, and his partner were taken into custody after the landing, 
prompting a raft of measures by the EU, including restricted access to the bloc's airspace for Belarusian carriers.

 In this Wednesday, May 26, 2021, file photo, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko addresses Parliament in 
Minsk, Belarus. Lukashenko defended the diversion of a commercial flight carrying dissident journalist Raman 
Pratasevich to Minsk, where he was arrested on Sunday, May 23, 2021. The diversion triggered bruising European 
Union sanctions and Lukashenko accused the West of trying to "strangle" his country. (Sergei Shelega/BelTA Pool

MOSCOW (AP) — Belarus' authoritarian leader will discuss closer economic ties with Russia on Friday, as he 
seeks support from his main backer amid a bruising showdown with the European Union over the forced diversion 
of a passenger jet to arrest a dissident journalist.  
 Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has found himself increasingly isolated after Belarusian flight 
controllers told the crew of a Ryanair plane to land because there was a bomb threat against it. No bomb was found 
once the place was on the ground, but 26-year-old journalist Raman Pratasevich was arrested along with his 
Russian girlfriend. 
 EU leaders called it piracy and responded by barring Belarusian carriers from the bloc's airspace and airports and 
advising European airlines to skirt Belarus. The bloc's foreign ministers sketched out tougher sanctions Thursday to 
target the country's lucrative potash industry and other sectors that are the main cash-earners for Lukashenko's 
government. 
 The dispute has pushed Lukashenko, who has relentlessly stifled dissent during his rule of more than a quarter-
century, even closer to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the two will meet Friday in the Black Sea resort of 
Sochi for talks on closer economic ties, according to the Kremlin. Earlier in the day, the two countries' prime 
ministers met in Minsk to pave the way for the presidents' talks. 
 The two ex-Soviet nations have signed a union agreement that calls for close political, economic and military ties, 
but that stops short of a full merger. Moscow has helped buttress Belarus' economy with cheap energy supplies and 
loans, but the ties have often been strained with Lukashenko scolding Moscow for trying to force him to relinquish 
control over prized economic assets and eventually abandon Belarus' independence. 
 In the past, the Belarusian leader has tried to play the West against Russia, raising the prospect of a 
rapprochement with the EU and the United States to wring more aid out of Moscow. (Ad) Peter Thiel, the billionaire 
Belarus' leader seeks Russia's support amid showdown with EU
investor behind Facebook, PayPal, and eBay, has a new darling industry in his sights. And he's betting a massive 
$210 million on its success. That's not pocket change. 
 Such tactics no longer work after Lukashenko's brutal crackdown on protests last fall in the wake of a vote that 
handed him a sixth term but that the opposition said was rigged. More than 35,000 people were arrested amid the 
protests and thousands beaten — moves that made him a pariah in the West. The flight's diversion has now 
cornered the Belarusian strongman even more. 
 The West had already slapped sanctions on Belarusian officials involved in the vote and crackdown against 
protesters and is now promising more. Many observers warn that Lukashenko has become easy prey for the 
Kremlin, which may use his isolation to push for closer integration. 
 Lukashenko said Friday before departing for Russia that he hopes to reach an agreement with Putin on resuming 
regular flights between the two countries that have been suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic.  
 Moscow has already offered Lukashenko quick political support over the plane's diversion, cautioning the EU 
against hasty action until the episode is properly investigated and arguing that Lukashenko's actions were in line 
with international protocols in cases of bomb threats. The International Civil Aviation Organization said Thursday 
that it will investigate the diversion, as many Western countries have asked. 
 Some in the West have alleged Russia was involved in the Ryanair flight's diversion — something Moscow angrily 
denies — and warned that it could exploit the situation to draw Belarus ever closer and possibly even incorporate it. 
 Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis charged Thursday that 'Lukashenko is playing with Putin, and 
trying and helping Putin to annex the country,' adding that 'we should send the signals to Russia as well that 
annexation wouldn't go well with Europe.' 
 On Friday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova denounced the EU's decision to ask 
European airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace as 'utterly irresponsible and threatening passengers' safety.' 
 As European airlines seek to skirt Belarus, Russia has refused some requests to change the flight paths of service 
to Moscow over the past two days in an apparent gesture of support for Lukashenko but allowed some flights to 
proceed Friday. 
 Austrian Airlines, for instance, canceled a flight from Vienna on Thursday, though the carrier said it was given 
permission to avoid Belarus for flights on the route Friday, according to the Austria Press Agency. It is still awaiting 
word on further flights. Air France canceled flights from Paris to Moscow on Thursday and Friday.

7 Lithium Stocks That Will Power the Electric Vehicle Boom[2] Demand for lithium is set to increase exponentially in 
the next few years. In fact, according to Statista, demand for lithium may very well double to 820,000 tons in that 
time. Some of that demand will come from companies that are manufacturing the batteries that we use every day. 
For example, lithium is an essential component of the batteries that power our mobile devices. 
 But the real growth will come as the United States goes all-in on electric vehicles (EVs). The Biden administration 
recently announced plans to have the U.S. government's fleet of over 600,000 vehicles converted to EVs. 
 And as you're aware, EV stocks are in a bubble of some sort at the moment. Some of that is due to the increasing 
number of companies that went public last year. However, as investors are beginning to realize, not all of these 
companies will be the next Tesla. In fact, some of these companies may never be successful at bringing an EV to 
market, at least not at the scale that will be required. 
 The ones that do make it will need lithium and lots of it. To help you sift through the best lithium stocks to buy, 
we've put together this special presentation.

 Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, smiles as he listens to Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko during 
their meeting in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Russia, Friday, May 28, 2021. (Mikhail Klimentyev, Sputnik, Kremlin 
Pool Photo via AP) 
MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin warmly welcomed his counterpart from Belarus for talks Friday 
on forging closer ties amid Minsk's bruising showdown with the European Union over the diversion of a passenger 
jet to arrest a dissident journalist. 
 Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has found himself increasingly isolated since flight controllers told the 
crew of a Ryanair plane to land in Minsk on Sunday citing an alleged bomb threat. No bomb was found, but 26-
year-old journalist Raman Pratasevich was arrested along with his Russian girlfriend. 
 EU leaders denounced it as air piracy and responded by barring Belarusian carriers from the bloc's airspace and 
airports and advising European airlines to skirt Belarus. EU foreign ministers sketched out tougher sanctions 
Thursday to target the country's lucrative potash industry and other cash-earning sectors. 
 At the start of his talks in the Black Sea resort of Sochi with Putin, Lukashenko ranted about the EU sanctions, 
describing them as an attempt to reignite the opposition protests that followed his reelection in August that was 
widely rejected as rigged.  
 'It's an attempt to destabilize the situation like last August,' he said. 
 Putin appeared relaxed and invited Lukashenko for a swim, while the Belarusian leader looked tense as he 
launched a long rant accusing the West of being perfidious and hypocritical. 
 In an emotional tirade, the 66-year-old Belarusian leader bemoaned the EU sanctions against the Belarusian flag 
carrier, Belavia, pointing to its role in carrying 'thousands and thousands' of travelers from EU nations and the U.S. 
who were stranded at the start of the pandemic. 
 'They have punished the Belavia staff who have helped evacuate thousands of their people!' Lukashenko 
exclaimed. 'What an abomination!' 
 Putin nodded in sympathy, pointing to a 2013 incident in which a private plane carrying Bolivian President Evo 
Morales landed in Vienna after several European nations had refused to let it cross their airspace, purportedly over 
speculation that Edward Snowden, who leaked classified U.S. government information, was on the plane. Austrian 
Belarus leader seeks Russian support amid showdown with EU
and Bolivian officials disagreed over whether the plane was searched after landing before resuming its journey. (Ad) 
Warning to all investors: There's a coming boom that might make the CBD craze look like an outdated investment. 
 'The Bolivian president's plane was forced to land, the president was taken off the plane, and it was OK, everyone 
kept silent,' Putin said with a chuckle.  
 Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who disclosed classified information about government 
surveillance programs, ended up in Russia, where he received asylum to avoid prosecution. 
 The showdown over the Ryanair diversion has pushed Lukashenko, who has relentlessly stifled dissent during his 
rule of more than a quarter-century, even closer to his main ally and sponsor, Russia. 
 The two ex-Soviet nations have signed a union agreement that calls for close political, economic and military ties 
but stops short of a full merger. Russia has buttressed Belarus' economy with cheap energy supplies and loans, but 
the ties often have been strained with Lukashenko scolding Moscow for trying to force him to relinquish control of 
prized economic assets and eventually abandon his country's independence. 
 In his remarks at the start of Friday's talks, Putin said the countries were moving to deepen their union 
"consistently, without rush, acting stage by stage.'  
 In the past, Lukashenko has tried to play the West against Russia, raising the prospect of a rapprochement with 
the EU and the U.S. to wring more aid out of Moscow. 
 Such tactics no longer work after Lukashenko's brutal crackdown last year. More than 35,000 people were arrested 
amid the protests and thousands beaten — moves that made him a pariah in the West. The flight's diversion has 
now cornered the Belarusian strongman even more. 
 Lukashenko, a former Soviet state farm director, ended the leaders' appearance before cameras in Sochi by 
exclaiming, 'There are no heights the Bolsheviks wouldn't storm!' — a line apparently from a Soviet-era movie. The 
remark drew a wry laugh from Putin. 
 Many observers warn that the new, tougher EU sanctions would make Lukashenko easy prey for the Kremlin, 
which may use his isolation to push for closer integration. Some in the West have even alleged Russia was involved 
in the Ryanair diversion — something Moscow angrily denies — and will seek to exploit the fallout. 
 'Lukashenko is scared, and the Kremlin may demand payment for its political support by pushing for the 
introduction of a single currency, the deployment of military bases and more,' said Valery Karbalevich, an 
independent Minsk-based political analyst. 'In this situation, it would be much more difficult for him to resist and 
bargain with Putin." 
 Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Lukashenko's main opponent in the election who left the country under official 
pressure, also acknowledged the danger that Russia may try to use his weakness to its advantage. She urged the 
EU to use whatever influence it has to help prevent any deals with Moscow that would hurt Belarus. 
 At the same time, Tsikhanouskaya also urged the EU to be "stronger, braver in its resolutions and decisions,' 
saying Lukashenko acted out of a sense of impunity in diverting the flight.  
 The European Commission on Friday presented a 3 billion euro ($3.7 billion) aid plan to support 'a future 
democratic Belarus' that could be activated if the country moves toward a 'democratic transition.' 
 But in a further sign of Belarus' isolation, the Geneva-based European Broadcasting Union moved Friday to 
suspend the Belarusian state broadcaster, BTRC, saying it has been particularly worried by its showing of 
interviews apparently obtained under duress. BTRC has two weeks to respond before the suspension takes effect. 
The move would bar Belarus from taking part in the Eurovision Song Contest, among other things. 
 Moscow has offered Lukashenko quick political support over the diversion, cautioning the EU against hasty action 
until the episode is properly investigated and arguing that Lukashenko's actions were in line with international 
protocols in cases of bomb threats.  
 Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova denounced the EU's decision to ask European airlines to 
avoid Belarusian airspace as 'utterly irresponsible and threatening passengers' safety.' 
 Dmitry Polyansky, Russia's deputy envoy at the United Nations, criticized the West on Friday for what he called a 
rash response and defended Belarus' narrative, arguing its flight controllers only 'recommended' the plane land in 
Minsk because of the purported threat, and the pilot could have continued if he wanted. 
 'To say from the outset that this is a forced landing, to condemn it and to introduce sanctions without any 
investigation — this kind of behavior is absolutely irresponsible," he said at a news conference. 
 The International Civil Aviation Organization has said it will investigate the diversion, as many Western countries 
have asked. 
Belarus leader seeks Russian support amid showdown with EU
 As European airlines began skirting Belarus, Russia has refused some of their requests to change the flight paths 
of service to Moscow in the past two days but allowed some flights to proceed Friday. The Kremlin said the denial 
of quick permissions to use the bypass routes was technical, but Lukashenko hailed it as a show of support for 
Belarus.

7 Stocks to Buy For the Gig Economy[2] Before the global pandemic, it was referred to as a side hustle—a way for 
some individuals to make a little extra money. However, as the pandemic has changed the nature of how we work, 
and as consumers how we spend, the gig economy has become an essential way of life for many workers. 
 There is much that's not known about the long-term effects of the pandemic. But if there's one lesson we learn from 
history, it's that there will be ripple effects. We believe that society will get back to something resembling normal. 
However, what that normal looks like may be different. 
 Americans were becoming less social since before the pandemic. Now consumers have begun to realize there 
truly is no reason to leave their house to shop for anything. And while many crave physical connection during these 
times, there will be many that have changed their purchasing habits for good. 
 Other elements of the gig economy, such as ride-hailing and home rentals, were devastated due to the pandemic. 
Those businesses are likely to come back. 
 And that's why companies that have created the gig economy aren't going away anytime soon. In this special 
report, we'll highlight several stocks that investors should consider as the gig economy moves forward.

May 28, 2021( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 It was a clear act of state-sponsored terrorism. An Irish passenger plane from the Irish budget airline Ryan Air, 
while on its way from Athens to Vilnius, was forced to land in the Belarusian capital Minsk on May 23 only minutes 
before it was due to leave Belarus' airspace.  
 Flimsy claims by Belarusian air traffic controller that a bomb was on board quickly turned out to be a hoax cooked 
up by the dictatorial regime of the country's long time leader Alexander Lukashenko. In reality, Lukashenko wanted 
Belarusian journalist and opposition activist Roman Protasevic (Raman Pratasevich in Belarusian), who was on 
board the flight, to be forcibly brought to Minsk.  
 The Belarusian dictator, who has held on to power using brutal methods to quash pro-democracy protests after a 
fraudulent election in August 2020, wanted to arrest one of his main opponents. After he was arrested, together with 
his Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega, the 26-year-old reporter was forced to make a confession after being visibly 
tortured by the Belarusian KGB. 
Roman Protasevich, seen here in the video released by Belarusian authorities several hours after being arrested 
when his Ryanair flight was redirected to Minsk in an act of state-sponsored hijacking. WIKIPEDIA 
Protasevich has been in Lukashenko's crosshairs due to his position as editor-in-chief of the popular Telegram 
channels Nexta and Nexta Live, both of which are based in neighboring Poland and have an audience of almost 
two million. They served as a channel for the large-scale anti-Lukashenko protests after last year's rigged election 
gave Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, a sixth term in office. 
 Next and Nexta Live helped expose in real-time the scale of the secret police's crackdown on the hundreds of 
thousands of Belarusians across the country. Lukashenko countered by saying he would 'rather be killed' than hold 
fresh elections, and accused Protasevich of 'terrorism'. 
 Protasevich had been in Athens to cover a visit by Svetlana Tikhanovskaya[1], Belarus' leader-in-exile. Like many 
other Belarusian opposition members, Pratasevich had been forced into exile, in his case to Lithuania, he and his 
colleagues now face terrorism-related charges for exposing the Lukashenko regime's corruption and abuse of 
power. 
 In the wake of the incident, the leaders of the EU and US immediately condemned Lukashenko and demanded the 
release of Pratasevich. The West is united against the regime in Minsk and have decided to levy new sanctions 
against the Lukashenko regime. Belarus' national flag carrier Belavia has been banned from all flights to EU 
Tougher sanctions against Belarus
countries. All European airlines have also been ordered to fly around Belarus' airspace to deprive Lukashenko of 
highly lucrative overflight fees. Other Belarusian politicians and entrepreneurs who remain loyal to Lukashenko 
have been banned from entering the European Union and further, potentially crippling, economic sanctions are 
most likely to follow soon. They will most likely target potash exports, which is one of the main revenue generators 
for Belarus. 
 The influential chairman of the British Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat, also urged the 
suspension of the controversial Nord Stream-II gas pipeline and the Yamal energy pipeline, both of which flow 
through Belarus and provide vast amounts of money that supports the 'tyrannous (Lukashenko) regime'.  
 The heads of foreign affairs from eight countries - the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, 
the UK and the US - have called for additional sanctions to be put in place against the Lukashenko regime, 
including the suspension of the country's right to use Interpol and other international organizations. 
 Lukashenko has declared that he 'will not remain silent and kneel down,' saying, 'I have acted lawfully by protecting 
the people according to all international rules.' He has also announced that he will announce counter-sanctions 
against European countries; a response that he claims is justified. 
 The extent to which Moscow knew about or colluded with the hijacking of the Ryanair flight remains an open 
question. Experts, including the renowned American historian Timothy Snyder, believe that the Kremlin most likely 
gave their tacit approval of the hijacking. 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko (L) and his close ally Russian President Vladimir Putin (R). 
Lukashenko, who for a while tried to free himself from Vladimir Putin's influence and position himself as a mediator 
in the ongoing war in eastern Ukraine, now seems to have become a complete puppet of Putin. Only days after 
forcing the Ryanair jet to land in Minsk, he was in talks with Putin in Sochi to discuss the West's reaction to his act 
of terrorism. 
 Moscow's open pushback against the EU's sanctions on Belarus is also striking. EU airlines, such as Austrian 
Airlines and Air France, which wanted to fly to Moscow via the new route past Belarus, were refused landing 
permission by Russian authorities. 
 Western diplomats have said they will be tough on Lukashenko. If that is the case, airlines like Turkish Airlines and 
Aeroflot, both of which continue to fly to Minsk, should be punished with a ban on flying to Europe. 
 The EU, the Council of Europe, the OSCE and international journalist organizations have unanimously condemned 
Protasevich's arrest. The Association of European Journalists (AEJ) made several demands in a letter to Teresa 
Ribeiro the new media-freedom reprentative of the OSCE, of which Belarus is a member, to have Protasevich set 
free. 
 'We urge the Representative on Media Freedom, Mrs Ribeiro, to issue a full and robust statement without delay 
condemning the actions of the Belarus authorities over the unlawful detention and treatment of Roman Protasevich 
and Sofia Sapega; the denial of their legal rights and concerns about their mistreatment in custody; and demanding 
their immediate release and the Belarus authorities' unconditional adherence to its OSCE obligations by ending 
their arbitrary and brutal suppression of the rights and safety of journalists and others and restoring the conditions 
for democracy and the rule of law.' 
 AEJ-General Secretary Edward Steen added in a statement: 'Roman faces up to 15 years in prison, maybe worse. 
Is that a price he or any other journalists must pay for simply doing their jobs?' Given the worsening crackdown on 
media in Russia itself, and especially the silencing and imprisonment of Alexei Navalny[2], possible Russian secret 
service involvement in Belarus was 'more than troubling'.

 Policy &#38; Research News 
Lukashenko, the Hijacker 
 The despicable arrest of the exiled opposition activist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega shocked, 
but not surprised, the world. The Belarus regimearrested[2]480 journalists only in 2020 and more than 35 000 
people have beenapprehended[3], but this case is, nevertheless, special. The Belarus authorities forced the 
Ryanair plane with 171 passengers and crew to land in Minsk due to the alleged suspicion of a bomb on board. 
Nothing indicates that the threat was real, the Ryanair CEO Michael O'Learydescribed[4]it as a state-sponsored 
hijacking. Most probably, there were KGB agents aboard. Protasevichtexted[5]his friend that he is being tailed by a 
Kremlin Watch Briefing: The West should respond to Lukashenko, the Hijacker
Russian-speaking man at the airport in Athens. In Minsk, four more people were deplaned which suggests that he 
was correct. 
Later, the video of Protasevich wasreleased[6]by state television Belarus 1. Belarusian activist acknowledged his 
role in the organization of mass protests after the presidential election, declared good health, and stated that he is 
being held in a pretrial detention facility in Minsk where everybody is treating him well. Protasevich is charged with 
terrorism and inciting mass riots. His alliesbelieve[7]that the statement was given under duress. Similarly, the 
international community does not believe in Belarus's innocence. The EU and the USA demand the prisoners be 
released. The EU statesagreed[8]on new economic sanctions on Lukashenko's regime and banned its state airlines 
from EU airspace and airports. The Council furtherappealed[9]to the members' airlines to avoid overflight of 
Belarus. The UKmirrored[10]the EU sanctions and similar steps weretaken[11]by Ukraine as well. 
And theanswer[12]of Belarus? New law forbidding journalists to inform about unallowed protests, ban on presenting 
results of opinion polls without approval, and stricter rules for organizing demonstrations. The legislature comes into 
force next month. Manifestly, Lukashenko demonstrates that he has no boundaries and the international 
community, led by the EU, has to react accordingly. Here are some suggestions:recognize[13]the airspace over 
Belarus as unsafe, forbid Belarussian aircraft at the EU airports, strong and well-targeted sanctions, support of 
Belarusian society and independent journalism,reconsideration[14]of Nord Steam 2, the expulsion of Belarus from 
Interpol, the expulsion of Belarus ambassadors and representatives of Belarusian KGB, and speedy investigation of 
the case with the clarification what role did Russia possibly play in it. 
 US waives sanctions on key players in Nord Stream 2 construction 
 On Wednesday, May 19th, the US Department of State waivedsanctions[15]placed upon the Nord Stream 2 
operator, Nord Stream 2 AG, andMatthias Warnig[16], the companies CEO and long-time associate of President 
Putin. 
A report detailing the planned waiver wasleaked[17]on the eve of a meeting between US Secretary of State Antony 
Blinken, and Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov. The timing of the leak and nature of the waiver 
could suggest that the US is attempting to lay the groundwork for a morestable relationship[18]with Russia ahead of 
a proposedmeeting[19]between Biden and Putin. Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskovstated[20]that the 
waiver was 'definitely a positive signal'. 
The move was also well received by German officials, who took the view that the waiver is a signal from the US that 
they are committed torebuilding ties[21]with Germany after thedamage[22]caused by the previous US 
administration. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maasstated[23], 'It's an expression of the fact that Germany is an 
important partner for the US'. Germany's unwavering support has led toaccusations[24]that they are prioritizing 
relations with Russia over EU unity and integrity. 
As expected, this reaction was in complete contrast to that of Ukraine. On May 21st, the Ukrainian parliament 
backed aresolution[25]calling on the US Congress to re-apply all sanctions in order to prevent the construction of 
Nord Stream 2. President Zelenskydeclared[26]that the completion of Nord Stream 2 would be a 'serious political 
victory' for the Kremlin, and the leader of the Holos Party, Kira Rudyk,added[27]that Nord Stream 2 is 'Russia's 
weapon in a hybrid war'. Further condemnation came from Poland, also a vociferous opponent of the project, with 
the government spokesman Piotr Mullerstating[28]'this information is definitely not positive from the security point of 
view'. This public criticism is particularly noteworthy, given how highly Poland values its cooperation and 
partnership with the United States. The formerLithuanian Minister of Foreign Affairs[29]noted that the waiver 'is 
certainly a big win forKremlin[30]and big disappointment forUkraine[31]'. 
At the current rate of construction, the pipeline is likely to be completed before the end of 2021, with some analysts 
suggesting that this sanctions waiver willspeed up[32]the process.

 US Developments 
U.S. officials describe first Blinken-Lavrov meeting as 'productive' 
 U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov,met[33]for the 
first time since President Biden took office. While U.S. officialsreported[34]that 'no substantive agreements were 
reached', they described the discussion as an 'open dialogue which could help to bridge the gap between the two 
countries.' Blinkenhighlighted[35]areas for cooperation between the two adversaries, such as fighting climate 
change and addressing the challenges posed by Covid-19: 'There are many areas where our interests intersect and 
overlap, and we believe that we can work together and, indeed, build on those interests.' 
This meeting comes at a moment when bilateral relations between the two nations are particularly tense. In March 
and April of this year, President Bidenissued[36]multiple rounds of stringent sanctions against Russia, responding 
to cyber attacks levied against the U.S., thetreatment[37]of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, renewed 
Russian aggression in Ukraine, and other malign actions. 
 U.S. lawmakers respond with anger to waived Nord Stream 2 sanctions 
 During his confirmation hearing, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinkenasserted[38]his commitment to do 
whatever he could 'to prevent the completion' of Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline. This week's shocking digression 
from these previously stated aims was met with immediate anger from Members of Congress. 'Two months ago, 
President Biden called Putin a 'killer,' but today he's planning to give Putin, his regime, and his cronies massive 
strategic leverage in Europe,'declared[39]Republican Senator Ben Sasse. 
On Thursday, May 20, a group of Republican Senatorsintroduced[40]a bill that would reimpose the removed 
sanctions. Democratic lawmakers also expressed their displeasure with this decision. In a statement, Senate 
Foreign Relations ChairmanBob Menendez[41]highlighted[42]the discrepancy between the Biden administration's 
aforementioned goals and this recent action: 'The administration has said that the pipeline is a bad idea and that it 
is a Russian malign influence project. I share that sentiment, but fail to see how today's decision will advance U.S. 
efforts to counter Russian aggression in Europe.' 
This debate has emerged as a likely point of bipartisan cooperation between Republican and Democratic 
lawmakers in an otherwise highly polarized Congress. 
 Kremlin's Current Narrative 
Russian state media goes on the offensive with the Ryanair incident, blames the West for 'double standards' 
 The reaction of Russian state-funded media to the 'hijacking' of Ryanair flight has been more offensive than 
defensive. Immediately, themessaging[43]was formulated in a way to represent Roman Protasevich as 'an activist 
suspected of involvement in terrorist activities' working for an 'extremist outlet'.Riafan[44]quotes political scientist 
Sergei Markov and writes that'The scale of information that Protasevich can give out to the Belarusian authorities 
about Western sponsors is amazing and frightens the countries of the West'. 
All the articles confirm that the Ryanair plane had to land in Minsk 'due to a bomb threat' without allowing 
alternatives to be part of the discourse. Russian state media fails to mention anywhere that besides Roman 
Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, one more citizen of Belarus and three other citizens of Russia didn't 
continue their flight to Vilnius. 
RIA Novosti quotes the interview with the press secretary of the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, Anatoly Glaz, 
whosaid[45]that the Ryanair incident is being'intentionally politicised with baseless accusations and labelling'.TASS 
Kremlin Watch Briefing: The West should respond to Lukashenko, the Hijacker
also activelypromoted[46]the comments of the Russian State Duma Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Leonid 
Slutsky, as he blamed his Western counterparts for having 'double standards'. 
The same narrative was promoted by the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Zakharova. In 
aninterview[47]withVesti FM radio station[48], she has labelled the Western reaction to the Ryanair incident 
as'nothing more than hysteria', adding that for the West,'Seizure through force was used to detain people and arrest 
them without a court ruling, only based on material planted by intelligence agencies and staged provocations.' 
She has additionally posted comments on Facebooksaying[49]that the West is 'following 'quod licet Iovi, non licet 
bovi' [What is permissible for Jupiter may not be permissible for a bull] principle'. All the major state media outlets, 
channelling her comments, constantly mention in reportingthat[50]'This is not the first time a plane was forced to 
land in Europe in an attempt to detain a wanted person'(referring to the cases of Edward Snowden &#38; an anti-
Maidan protester). 
Kremlin Watchis a strategic program of the European Values Center for Security Policy, which aims to expose and 
confront instruments of Russian influence and disinformation operations focused against the liberal-democratic 
system.

 Recent events could complicate the return of Euronews to Belarus. 
 As previously reported by Broadband TV News[1], the country's Ministry of Information excluded the channel in 
April on the grounds that its licence had expired. Furthermore, it was broadcasting adverts in English instead of 
translating them into Russian or Belarusian. 
 Perhaps not surprising, the move was criticised in a number of quarters, not least the European Commission. For 
its part, according to industry sources, Euronews decided in early May to reapply for a licence in accordance with 
local advertising rules. The sources add that the channel expected to hear back from the authorities by the 
beginning of June, though this was prior to the Ryanair incident and ensuing international outcry. 
 Euronews is currently expanding its presence across Central and Eastern Europe by entering into partnerships and 
launching localised versions of its service. In Serbia, for instance, it teamed up media group HD-WIN, part of 
Telekom Srbija, in July 2019 and earlier this year with University Politehnica of Bucharest (UPB) in Romania and 
Europa TV in Bulgaria. It also launched Euronews Georgia, which is owned by Silknet, in September last year. 
 Although it has been criticised in some quarters for its involvement with state-owned Telekom Srbija, Euronews 
remains widely respected throughout Europe for providing generally objective reporting at a time when press 
freedoms are increasingly coming under threat. Whether it receives a new licence to operate in Belarus remains to 
be seen, though it is likely to prove more difficult following the Ryanair incident. 
 In the meantime, we may well see more announcements of upcoming localised versions of Euronews in the CEE 
region.

Belarus Threatens West as EU Debates Severe Sanctions

 President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus has threatened to retaliate for any European Union sanctions imposed 
on him for detaining two opposition activists after forcing their plane to land in Minsk earlier this week. 
Hours before a scheduled meeting in the Russian seaside resort of Sochi with Russia's President Vladimir Putin, 
his only major international ally, the Belarusian leader warned he would allow migrants and drugs to pour into 
western Europe. The 66-year-old said, 'We stopped drugs and migrants. Now you will eat them and catch them 
yourselves.' 
In a show of support for Lukashenko, Russia has been refusing permission for some European passenger jets to 
enter its airspace after airlines, following EU guidance, ordered their planes to alter their usual flight paths and 
bypass Belarus, depriving the Belarusian government of millions of dollars in flyover fees. 
Austria Thursday condemned Moscow's decision to cancel the Vienna-Moscow service as 'absolutely 
incomprehensible.' 
'It is in the interests of both Austria and Russia that all flights to and via Russia can continue to be carried out 
without any problems,' the Austrian foreign ministry said in a statement. 
Lukashenko also sought Thursday to play down the impact of any possible EU economic sanctions, saying, 'We'll 
substitute Europe, which is growing mercilessly old, for rapidly growing Asia.' 
He continued to maintain that Belarus diverted Sunday's Ryanair's Athens-Vilnius flight because of a bomb threat 
against the flight by the Palestinian militant group Hamas. 
 Belarus Opposition Leader Alleges Journalist from Diverted Plane Beaten in Detention 
 Opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich was arrested Sunday after a Belarussian fighter jet forced a passenger 
plane in which he was traveling to land in Minsk 
Belarus Threatens West as EU Debates Severe Sanctions
 The claim is dismissed by Hamas, and by Western governments, which say the forced landing of the Ryanair plane 
amounted to 'state-sponsored hijacking.' 
Opposition activists 26-year-old Roman Pratasevich, a blogger, and 23-year-old Sofia Sapega, a law student and 
Russian national, were taken from the plane and arrested when it landed in the Belarusian capital. Both are 
accused of a variety of offenses, including inciting rallies against Lukashenko in the wake of last August's 
presidential election, which was widely denounced by Western powers as rigged and fraudulent. 
European leaders have expressed outrage at the diversion of the Ryanair flight between two EU capitals and on 
Monday EU leaders discussed the incident at a summit, with European Council President Charles Michel saying in 
a statement the Belarus action 'will not remain without consequences.' During an informal meeting in Lisbon 
Thursday, EU foreign ministers planned the steps to take in addition to the ban on EU-based airlines using 
Belarusian airspace. 
The proposals being discussed focus on economic and sector-specific sanctions, EU officials told VOA. 
'We will continue to look at what consequences [sanctions] will have in Belarus, whether Lukashenko will give in. 
And if this is not the case, we have to assume that this will be only the beginning of a big and long spiral of 
sanctions,' German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said. 
Maas said sanctions must be made 'effective' by targeting business sectors that are important to Belarus' economy. 
He cited the potassium and phosphate sectors. 
'There is also the question to what extent Belarus should still be allowed to issue government bonds by the 
Belarusian state or by the Central Bank in Europe in the future,' he added. He said Lukashenko's behavior was 'so 
unacceptable,' the EU should not be satisfied with small steps. 
Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told reporters Thursday, 'We could talk about [sanctions on] the 
oil production sector.' Foreign ministers of the G-7 countries have separately called for the 'immediate and 
unconditional release' of Protasevich and Sapega 'as well as all other journalists and political prisoners held in 
Belarus.' 
'We will enhance our efforts, including through further sanctions as appropriate, to promote accountability for the 
actions of the Belarusian authorities,' the G-7 group said in a statement. 
There are splits among Western governments about how severe sanctions should be, though, with some arguing 
that a balance must be struck between punishing the Belarusian authorities while avoiding driving the country 
deeper into the arms of Putin, who Lukashenko is economically and militarily heavily reliant on.  
Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg has publicly advocated moderation, fearing deep and wide 
sanctions risk harming ordinary Belarusians without deterring Lukashenko. 
'We must also be careful that we do not hit people in Belarus,' he said. Estonia's foreign minister, Eva-Maria 
Liimets, appeared to echo those sentiments, telling reporters in Lisbon she hopes sanctions can be focused on 
'companies which are close to the Belarusian regime.' 
Some Western analysts say fears of driving Lukashenko further into the Russian fold are misplaced. The diversion 
of the Ryanair flight, said Keir Giles of Britain's Chatham House, 'could be no clearer statement that President 
Lukashenko has turned his back on the West and abandoned any restraint or concern for international censure.' 
'Four years ago,' he added, 'Belarus was still ostensibly nurturing a fragile form of independence, maintaining a 
degree of willfulness in its independent foreign policy from Russia, trying to quietly grow ties with the West while not 
Belarus Threatens West as EU Debates Severe Sanctions
alienating President Putin, and resisting Moscow's attempts to take over the military defense of Belarusian territory.' 
Now, however, Giles said he believes "Lukashenko has placed all his bets on Moscow and Russia.' 
Russian officials have backed Lukashenko but initially did so softly, possibly because, some Western diplomats 
suspect, the Kremlin was trying to take stock of what the implications could be for the just-agreed summit meeting 
next month between U.S. President Joe Biden and Putin, the first face-to-face encounter between the pair since 
Biden was elected president. 
 Biden, Putin Agree to June 16 Summit in Geneva 
 White House says it hopes US, Russia will 'restore predictability and stability' to their relationship 
 The editor-in-chief of state-controlled Russia Today, Margarita Simonyan, said, at the start of the week, that 
Lukashenko 'played it beautifully,' but top Kremlin officials were less forthcoming initially, with Putin's spokesman 
declining press requests to comment, until Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov characterized Lukashenko's 
actions 'absolutely reasonable.' 
Lavrov called on other countries 'to soberly assess the situation.' 
Lukashenko's relationship with Putin has long been a fitful one, with the two frequently falling out. Lukashenko has 
relied on financial subsidies and oil supplies from Russia. A senior Russian diplomat based in Minsk once described 
to VOA a 'shouting match' he overheard during a phone conversation between them. The dispute was over the 
Belarusian leader's resistance to Putin's goal of closer integration between Russia and its onetime Soviet satellite, 
he said.  
Analysts say Putin's major Belarus objective is to ensure — much as his goal is with Ukraine — that it doesn't end 
up as a pro-Western enclave on Russia's borders. The Belarusian leader has long played the West against Russia 
and vice versa. He observed a neutral stance over Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. 
Western diplomats say it is irrelevant whether Russia is full-throated in backing Lukashenko or more vocally 
restrained. Either way Lukashenko has no one else to turn to now for support. They note since the August election, 
and the mass protests of his continued rule, he has been keener for closer cooperation between his military and 
Russia's. That has seen the establishment of joint military training centers and planning for a massive joint military 
exercise in September, known as Zapad-2021. Before departing Friday for Sochi, Lukashenko said he would be 
discussing with Putin restoring commercial air services between Russia and Belarus suspended because of the 
coronavirus pandemic. Kremlin officials said discussions would focus on forming closer economic ties between the 
two countries.

 By EU vs Disinfo[1] 
Theillegitimate[2]president of Belarus, Alyaksandr Lukashenka, is clinging to power, based on a lie that he won the 
presidential election in August 2020. This is the fundamental lie of his power. To prop up the lie, he has resorted to 
violence on several occasions. 
Alyaksandr Lukashenka is anillegal[3]president, but he controls the machineries of lies and violence in Belarus. The 
act of air-piracy against Ryanair FR4879 illustrates both. In order to extort violence against a dissident journalist, he 
deploys a lie about a bomb threat, and supports that lie with a threat of military violence, sending a fighter jet to 
intercept the passenger aircraft. 
 Military Violence 
 The conversation between the air traffic control and the flight crew was deliberately doctored in news reports. 
TheBelarusian state broadcaster attempted to show[4]that the decision to land in Minsk, despite Vilnius being 
closer, was taken by the flight crew: 
A portion of the conversation between an air traffic controller and Boeing pilots leaves no ambiguity: the pilot clearly 
lets the other side know that the initiative to land in Belarus belongs to the crew. This is the crew's decision: to 
make a turn and to land at Minsk International Airport minutes later. The reason is a message about a bomb placed 
onboard the plane. 
This statement is false. The full transcript,published the next day[5], shows that Minsk air traffic control instructed 
the pilots to divert to Minsk: 
Lies, Damned Lies And Lukashenka's Lies
Pilot: OK, I give you (unreadable) can you say again the IATA code of the airport that authorities have 
recommended us to divert to? 
ATC: RYR 1TZ Standby. 
Pilot: Standby, roger. 
ATC: 09:41:00: RYR 1TZ. 
Pilot: Go ahead. 
ATC: IATA code is MSQ. 
Pilot: can you say again please? 
ATC: IATA code MSQ. 
Pilot: MSQ, thanks. 
Pilot: 09:41:58: RYR 1TZ Again, this recommendation to divert to Minsk, where did it come from? Where did it come 
from? Company? Did it come from departure airport authorities or arrival airport authorities? 
ATC: RYR 1TZ this is our recommendations. 
Pilot: can you say again? 
ATC: RYR 1TZ this is our recommendations. 
In a passionate speech Wednesday 26 May,Mr Lukashenka emphasised[6]that he was responsible for all actions 
taken in order to divert the aircraft, as the bomb threat was serious. 
Research produced by The Daily Beast[7]and The Dossier Center has obtained the original bomb threat e-mail, 
allegedly sent from Hamas to the airport authorities. And the letter was sent 24 minutesafterthe order to divert the 
airport. The lie about the bomb threat is not only a lie, it is a crude lie. 
 Civilian Lies 
 While theillegitimate[8]president Lukashenka is lying, his minions focus on the applied violence. The state-run 
news agency of Belarus has distributed videos, in which the detained Raman Pratasevich and Sofia Sapega 
'confess to their crimes'. This is a practice used by terrorist groups and rogue states. 
Violence and lies are intimately connected. Nobel Prize laureate Alexander Solzhenitsyndescribes in an essay[9]the 
connection between the noisy violence and the poisonous lies: 
When violence bursts onto the peaceful human condition, its face is flush with self-assurance, it displays on its 
banner and proclaims: 'I am Violence! Make way, step aside, I will crush you!' But violence ages swiftly, a few years 
pass—and it is no longer sure of itself. To prop itself up, to appear decent, it will without fail call forth its ally—Lies. 
For violence has nothing to cover itself with but lies, and lies can only persist through violence. 
Lies, Damned Lies And Lukashenka's Lies
On 21 May this year, the opposition activist Vitold Ashurakdied from head wounds[10]in prison. In November 2020, 
the opposition activist Raman Bandarenka died after police violence in Minsk. In February 2021, theUN Special 
Rapporteur on human rights in Belarus[11], Anas Marin, reported thousands of cases of torture, intimidation and 
threats against activists, human rights defenders and journalists. Ms Marin concludes her report: 
The unprecedented scale of human rights violations, the ultimate impunity in which they are being perpetrated, and 
the continuing deterioration of the human rights situation - all of these should compel the international community 
not only to continue its close scrutiny of the human rights situation in Belarus, but also to further consolidate its 
efforts to change the trends I just mentioned. The Belarusian people are eager to see these changes, and these 
efforts too. 
The Belarusian human rights organisation,Viasna,[12]reports that Lukashenka's regime currently holds 421 political 
prisoners. Belarus is one of the 51 founding members of the United Nations. The country is being held hostage by 
Lukashenka, who is denying Belarusians the fundamental freedoms of the UN Charter.

EU weighs Belarus sanctions at sectors close to leader

LISBON, Portugal (AP) — European Union nations sketched out plans Thursday for new sanctions against Belarus, 
targeting economic sectors close to its authoritarian leader, as they sought to strike back at him for the diversion of 
a passenger jet to arrest a dissident journalist.
Meeting in Lisbon, EU foreign ministers vowed to continue ramping up pressure on Belarusian President Alexander 
Lukashenko — whose disdain for democratic norms and human rights has made his country a pariah in the West.
The country's isolation has only deepened since Sunday, when Belarusian flight controllers told the crew of a 
Ryanair jet about a bomb threat and instructed it to land in Minsk, where journalist Raman Pratasevich was pulled 
off the plane.
A list of EU sanctions in place against senior members of the Belarus government, including Lukashenko, “isn’t 
having the dissuasive effect we need,” said Portuguese Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva.
Amid the testy standoff, Belarus did get some help from its ally Russia, which refused to allow two Moscow-bound 
jetliners to change their flight paths in order to avoid Belarus' airspace.
As the EU works to hold Lukashenko to account, Pratasevich's parents appealed at a news conference in Poland 
for help from the international community to free their 26-year-old son.
“I want you to hear my cry, the cry of my soul. So that you understand how difficult it is for us now and how much 
we are experiencing this situation,” said his mother, Natalia Pratasevich. "I am begging you, help me free my son.”
The EU ministers said they kept the family in mind as they did their work.
“I’m thinking of this young blogger, this young journalist, his mother and his father," Luxembourg Foreign Minister 
Jean Asselborn said in the Portuguese capital. "These are bandit tricks that are being carried out here. That can’t 
be tolerated by the European Union.”
EU weighs Belarus sanctions at sectors close to leader
The latest plans for sanctions, which could target the country's lucrative potash industry among others, comes after 
the dramatic diversion of the Ryanair flight. EU leaders have denounced the move as a state-sponsored hijacking, 
while Lukashenko defended his actions and accused the West of trying to “strangle” his country with sanctions.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc would not ease up on Belarus. “We need to move more swiftly on 
sanctions,” he said after the informal Lisbon gathering, which drew up guidance for EU leaders but was not meant 
to take concrete action.
The EU has already advised its airlines to avoid the ex-Soviet nation's airspace and barred Belarusian carriers from 
EU airports and airspace.
But in a sign of support for Belarus, Russian authorities refused to allow two EU-based carriers to change their 
routes to Moscow so they could skirt Belarusian airspace. An Austrian Airlines flight from Vienna and an Air France 
flight from Paris both had to be canceled, the companies said. It was unclear what would happen to Friday's 
schedule.
The French pilots’ union SNPL said in a statement it was "more than surprised” at the move.
“While normally the responses to this type of request for modification are accepted immediately, it’s been radio 
silence for two days” from the Russian authorities, it said.
The 27-nation bloc previously slammed Belarusian authorities with sanctions over the August election, which gave 
Lukashenko a sixth term and that opposition groups have rejected as rigged, along with his ensuing crackdown on 
protests.
If the next batch of sanctions does not ease the crackdown on the opposition and democratic values, German 
Foreign minister Heiko Maas said the EU “will continue to look at what effects this has in Belarus, whether 
Lukashenko relents. If that isn’t the case, we have to assume that this will be just the beginning of a big and long 
spiral of sanctions.”
Foreign ministers from the G-7 group of leading industrialized nations — which includes some EU countries — also 
promised to take action. They said in a statement: “We will enhance our efforts, including through further sanctions 
as appropriate, to promote accountability for the actions of the Belarusian authorities.”
The EU has tried on and off to encourage democratic reforms in Belarus — bring it closer to the bloc and distance it 
from Russia — but has not had much success. Some say more sanctions will do little to alleviate the situation and 
will only push it closer to Russia, reducing the influence of the EU and others.
Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg acknowledged it is a difficult balance.
“What we don't want to do is to drive the country in the arms of Russia,” he said.
Asselborn said the bloc was focused on the country's large potash industry, a major supplier for fertilizer, "and I 
think it would hurt Lukashenko a great deal if we accomplished something there.”
The giant Belaruskali plant, which is controlled by the state as are most economic assets in the country of 9.3 
million, is the main cash earner for Lukashenko's government, along with petrochemicals.
Later in the day, the International Civil Aviation Organization was planning a closed-door meeting at its 
headquarters in Montreal to discuss Sunday's flight diversion. Western leaders have asked the organization to 
investigate.
Lukashenko on Wednesday defended the move, maintaining a bomb threat was made against the flight. He also 
insisted Belarusian authorities had a legitimate right to arrest Pratasevich, who has become one of his top foes, 
saying that the journalist was trying to foment a “bloody rebellion." Pratasevich's Russian girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, 
who also was on the flight, was arrested as well.
EU weighs Belarus sanctions at sectors close to leader
Pratasevich, who left Belarus in 2019, ran a popular messaging app that had a key role in helping organize huge 
demonstrations against Lukashenko after the August election. But he has only increased his crackdown, and more 
than 35,000 people have been arrested since the protests began, with thousands reported beaten.

The Italian competition watchdog (L'Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato - AGCM) has imposed fines 
totalling EUR8.4 million euros (USD10.2 million) on Ryanair, easyJet, and Volotea, for flouting consumer protection 
laws during the pandemic. The regulator fined Ryanair EUR4.2 million euros (USD5.12 million), easyjet EUR2.8 
million (USD3.4 million), and Spanish airline Volotea EUR1.4 million (USD1.7 million) for not reimbursing customers 
for flights cancelled after June 3, 2020, once travel restrictions linked to the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy had ended. 
The law quoted is Italy's "Consumer Code" (Legislative Decree 6 of September 2005, no. 
206), which aligns with European Union consumer protection legislation. The Italian watchdog, in a statement, said 
the three airlines had engaged in "seriously improper conduct" and did not apply "professional diligence" when - 
once the government had relaxed the travel restrictions in Italy - they proceeded with numerous flight cancellations 
and sale offers using the COVID-19 crisis as an excuse. They had also continued to issue vouchers instead of 
refunding cancelled tickets. Furthermore, the authority found that information had been lacking or misleading about 
consumers' rights. Reimbursements were hindered and delayed through methods and procedures to induce - and 
in some cases even force - consumers to choose and/or accept vouchers instead of refunds. In Ryanair's case, its 
advertising campaign from June 2020 was considered misleading and focused on the possibility of changing flights 
for free (through the claim "no change penalties" or similar) while the company actually had charged higher fares for 
new flights chosen by consumers, and still had charged a penalty if the flight change took place seven days before 
departure. In addition to the payment of fines, the three carriers would have to present corrective measures adopted 
in response to the authority's finding, the regulator said.

EU Could Hit Key Belarus Exports Over Plane 'Hijacking': Borrell
EU Could Hit Key Belarus Exports Over Plane 'Hijacking': Borrell

 The EU is intent on making Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko pay a high price for the forced landing of a 
European airliner to arrest regime opponents, the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told AFP. 
"The heads of state and government asked us on Monday (at a summit) to propose sectoral economic sanctions, 
something that we are not used to doing in the EU, and there are some that immediately come to mind," Borrell said 
in an interview Wednesday in Lisbon on the eve of an informal meeting of foreign ministers. 
"Belarus is a big exporter of potash: $2.5 billion. Everything goes through the Baltic countries. It's easy to control it, 
if you really want to," he said. 
"One can also imagine that the gas which arrives in Europe via Belarus could come to Europe via another pipeline, 
and Belarus would lose the transit fees, which is not negligible," he added. 
Lukashenko sparked international outrage by dispatching a fighter jet Sunday to intercept a Ryanair flight from 
Athens to Vilnius carrying dissident reporter Roman Protasevich, 26, and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega. 
EU leaders hit back at Minsk, agreeing to ban Belarusian airlines from the bloc and urging EU-based carriers not to 
fly over its airspace. 
The leaders also tasked Borrell with coming up with further "targeted economic sanctions" against the Belarusian 
authorities to add to the 88 regime figures and seven companies already on a blacklist over a crackdown on the 
opposition. 
 "Hijacking a plane to stop a passenger, that required a strong reaction. We made decisions on the spot Monday for 
air transport and they will hurt. But the European leaders have asked for more. If we did not now employ the 
language of power, that would have been proof that we did not want to do it," Borrell said.

Olivier HOSLET  
"Europeans are still hesitant about economic sanctions, but this time, we really have to take measures that 
Lukashenko will feel," he stressed. 
"I don't think it will take a long time to decide. If we want to do it, we can do it quickly," he insisted. 
EU foreign ministers meeting in Portugal on Thursday were set to begin discussions on the Belarus sanctions -- but 
no decision was expected immediately, Borrell said. 
While the forced landing of the plane in Minsk has thrust Belarus to the top of the EU's agenda, Borrell warned that 
in the longer-term, the bloc faces more problems working out how to deal with Lukashenko's key backer Russia. 
EU Could Hit Key Belarus Exports Over Plane 'Hijacking': Borrell
"Everything cannot be achieved through sanctions. With the dynamic 'I sanction you, you sanction me', we are 
entering a spiral," he said. 
EU leaders "asked us to present in June a report in which we analyse where we are with Russia and what we can 
do. But I insist: we have not been asked for sanctions," he said.

"Relations with Russia are very bad and we are now at a point where we have to decide what will be next." 
Borrell said that President Vladimir Putin had opted for "confrontation" with the EU and "is becoming more and 
more authoritarian" at home. 
"But we have to be careful. Facing Russia, we need the unity of the EU to succeed in stopping it when it violates 
international law, but we must also be able to talk to it," he said. 
"Unfortunately the EU does not always manage to find unity. Each member state has its interests and the 
temptation of some is to go it alone with the feeling that they will do better." 
Borrell pointed to the relationship with the United States as one where the EU is also split as some in the bloc push 
for Europe to act more independently on the world stage. 
"Here too we are very divided. There are countries which will always align themselves with the American positions 
and others which have a more autonomous vision," he said, 
"Every time I say the words 'strategic autonomy', there are member states who say you want us to distance 
ourselves from the United States, you want to weaken NATO. But that has nothing to do with it," he insisted. 
"Sometimes I have the feeling that some people feel much more reassured by a state of dependence in the 
partnership with the United States," he comments. 
"There is no alternative to NATO for the territorial defence of Europe. But there are problems for which we 
Europeans should be able to provide a solution, pan-European, because neither NATO nor the United States will 
deal with it," he insisted. 
The EU's top diplomat highlighted the challenge of a rising China and the US decision to withdraw from Afghanistan 
as examples of the need to be able to act independently. 
"If Europe wants to be a global player, it must be able to defend its economic interests with China without having to 
need the sponsorship of the United States," he said. 
On Afghanistan, Borrell said he was "not very optimistic about what will happen" once US and NATO troops pull 
out. 
"When you lose a war, you lose a war," he said. 
"For us Europeans the question arises of how to manage our presence. We must ensure a hospital and an airport 
that work if we want to maintain a minimum presence, but not with a military presence," he said.

The aeropolitical dispute following the May 23 forced diversion of a Ryanair flight by authorities in Minsk has 
reached new heights after the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) formally recommended avoiding 
Belarusian airspace. In a seemingly retaliatory response, Russia has since banned from flying to Moscow, at least 
three European flights that followed this recommendation. On May 25, EASA issued a Safety Information Bulletin, in 
which it accused Belarus of disregarding international civil aviation rules and creating unnecessary danger. 
"The circumstances surrounding this action cast serious doubts on the respect shown by Belarus for international 
civil aviation rules... The actions undertaken by Belarus amounted to an increased safety risk for the above-
mentioned flight and put into question the ability of Belarus to provide safe air navigation services," the European 
regulator said. EASA consequently recommended that all airlines based in its member states (the European Union, 
Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein) avoid flying over, as well as to, Belarus pending the conclusion of 
an investigation into the event. Even though the bulletin is not a safety directive and therefore not binding, all EASA-
regulated carriers have followed the recommendation. The agency also advised all Third Country Operators flying 
to or from EASA member states to avoid Belarusian airspace, although this recommendation has even less legally 
binding and has only been followed by a limited number of carriers. Among the few that adhered to the 
recommendation is Singapore Airlines, which confirmed it would not be flying over Belarus for the time being. 
However, as European airlines started following the recommendation, so Moscow, a key backer of strongman 
Alexander Lukashenko, has stepped in. On May 26, Russian authorities denied Air France (AF, Paris CDG) 
permission to fly to Moscow Sheremetyevo after the flight plan it filed followed a route that would have avoided 
Belarus. On May 27, the French carrier had to cancel its service to Moscow again for the same reason. On the 
same day, the Russian authorities issued a similar refusal to Austrian Airlines, forcing it to cancel its Vienna-
Moscow Domodedovo flight. However, other European Union carriers have continued to fly to Moscow even though 
they have also bypassed Belarus. Ryanair flight FR4978 from Athens Int'l to Vilnius was forced to land at Minsk 
National by the Belarusian authorities after they alerted the crew about a suspected bomb on board. They then 
scrambled a MiG-29 fighter jet to force the jet down just as it was due to leave Belarusian airspace. Upon landing, 
the authorities detained independent journalist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega. The aircraft 
departed to Vilnius after a 7-hour delay. The event prompted the European Union to ban Belavia (B2, Minsk 
National) from the bloc's airspace.

The European track cycling championships planned for the end of June in Minsk have been cancelled due to the 
tense political situation in Belarus, ruling body UEC said on Thursday after a meeting in Lausanne.
"We have recently been monitoring the situation with the Belarus Cycling Federation which has now developed into 
an international debate and today during the Management Board meeting, we have decided to cancel the event in 
Minsk," UEC president Enrico Della Casa said.
"We are already working on finding an alternative solution," he added.
The German cycling federation had decided not to participate in the tournament in response to the forced landing of 
a plane in Minsk. The championships were to take place from June 23-27.
On Sunday a Ryanair passenger plane was forced to land in Minsk and authorities used it to have dissident 
Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich arrested at the airport.
The European Union has imposed new sanctions on the power apparatus in Belarus because of the action, 
including a landing ban for the former Soviet republic's airlines and sanctions on the leadership.
In January, Belarus' capital of Minsk had already been removed as co-host of this year's ice hockey world 
championships due to political unrest in the country.

 The parents of a jailed Belarusian journalist pleaded for help Thursday as it emerged that Russia is blocking 
European airline flights that avoid Belarus airspace in a diplomatic battle over his arrest. 
The G7 global powers also demanded Minsk release Roman Protasevich and the EU's foreign policy chief 
threatened hard-hitting economic sanctions.

Belarus's strongman President Alexander Lukashenko sparked international outrage by dispatching a fighter jet 
Sunday to intercept a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius carrying Roman Protasevich, 26, and his girlfriend Sofia 
Sapega, 23. 
A nervous-looking Protasevich was last seen in a video released by Belarusian authorities on Monday in which he 
was seen supposedly admitting to helping to organise mass unrest, a charge that could land him in jail for 15 years. 
"I want you to relay our appeal everywhere, throughout the world, to government representatives, to EU countries, 
to EU leaders, to US leaders: I am appealing, I am begging, help me free my son," his mother Natalia told 
journalists in Warsaw, visibly moved.

Roman's father, Dmitry said his son was "a tough man" and "a hero". 
"Throughout his life he fought for the truth and passed it on to people, which is why Lukashenko committed this 
despicable act," he said.

Foreign ministers of the Group of Seven wealthy nations on Thursday demanded the "immediate and unconditional 
release" of Protasevich, "as well as all other journalists and political prisoners held in Belarus", in a joint statement 
published by the British government. 
The European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told AFP that member states were considering "sectoral" 
economic sanctions against Belarus, targeting big exports such as potash.

The bloc was also looking at "targeted sanctions" against the Belarusian authorities to add to the 88 regime figures

presidential election. 
"Europeans are still hesitant about economic sanctions, but this time, we really have to take measures that

At a briefing in Vilnius, where she fled to after last year's election, exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana 
Tikhanovskaya on Thursday called for an "economic boycott of the regime". 
Christophe Deloire, the head of media rights watchdog Reporters Sans Frontieres (Reporters Without Borders) was 
also in Lithuania to file a legal complaint against Lukashenko with prosecutors investigating Sunday's incident.

"We came here because we want to send a signal that we support the journalists in Belarus," said Deloire. 
The UN civil aviation agency was meanwhile due to hold an urgent meeting Thursday to discuss Belarus after 
Western powers on the UN Security Council called on it to investigate Minsk's diversion of the Ryanair flight 
carrying Protasevich. 
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council will meet as the consequences of the incident play out 
in Europe's airspace. 
EU countries are banning Belarusian carriers and the EU has also urged airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace. 
On Thursday, Austrian Airlines said it had cancelled a Vienna-Moscow flight after Russian authorities did not 
approve a route change for it to avoid Belarusian airspace. 
An Air France flight from Paris to Moscow on Wednesday had to be cancelled for the same reason. 
The ICAO has no power to impose sanctions. But European leaders this week agreed to cut air links with Belarus 
and told airlines to avoid the country's airspace. 
The call at the UN for the ICAO investigation echoes an earlier one from NATO. But Russia's support for Minsk 
means the UN Security Council is unlikely to agree a collective statement. 
A defiant Lukashenko said he had "acted lawfully to protect our people" from an alleged bomb threat on the plane, 
in an address to parliament on Wednesday. 
The criticism was nothing more than another attempt by his opponents to undermine his rule, he added. 
Lukashenko -- often dubbed "Europe's last dictator" -- is facing some of the strongest international pressure of his 
nearly 27 years ruling ex-Soviet Belarus. 
He and his allies are already under a series of Western sanctions over a brutal crackdown on mass protests that 
followed his disputed re-election to a sixth term last August. 
But he continues to enjoy solid support from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is hosting the Belarusian leader 
on Friday.

Borrell mooted targeting the potash fertiliser sector or refusing gas being delivered to the bloc via Belarus over the 
"hijacking" of the plane by the regime. 
He was echoed by German Foreign Minister Heiko Mass also raised the possibility of hitting key firms in the 
fertiliser sector and said the EU could curb the Belarusian government's ability to issue bonds in Europe. 
But he played down the likelihood of the bloc agreeing quickly to reject gas transiting through pipelines in Belarus, 
insisting it was "more of a medium and long-term issue".

 The head of Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF) protested on Thursday at the Belarusian border along 
with dozens of journalists after the arrest of anti-regime blogger Roman Protasevich. 
RSF chief Christophe Deloire and the Belarusian and Lithuanian journalists placed portraits of their 21 colleagues 
imprisoned in Belarus on a fence along the EU border between Lithuania and Belarus. 
Deloire called the government of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, in power since 1994, "predators of 
the liberty of the press" and said the strongman was acting like a "terrorist". 
Reporters Without Borders this week asked Lithuanian prosecutors to investigate Lukashenko's role in diverting the 
plane carrying Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega on Sunday. 
There has been no contact with either of them since their arrest except for two supposed "confession" videos 
released by Belarusian authorities. 
"Lukashenko himself should be prosecuted, because what he has done, what he has clearly ordered and what he 
now justifies is plane hijacking with terrorist intentions and he is responsible," Deloire, holding a photo of 
Protasevich, told AFP. 
He said the international community should pressure on the regime to secure journalist's release. 
 "We will not forget you, we will continue to fight for you," Deloire said.

Standing at the border, Lithuanian journalist Sarunas Cerniauskas said this was "as close as we can get to the 
regime". 
"But we really want to come closer when it comes to exposing the things that are going on in Belarus and all the 
abuses of human rights and the abuses of power," said Cerniauskas, head of an investigative journalism centre in 
Lithuania. 
Indre Makaraityte, who works for the Lithuanian national broadcaster, said: "Any dictator and any tyrant is afraid of 
publicity". 
Belarusian journalist Maksim Tsikhenia, a correspondent for Belarusian media outlet Charter 97, called the events 
in Belarus "terrible". 
"By our presence, we want to declare the need to give freedom to independent journalists and independent 
journalism," he said. 
RSF Media Watchdog Chief Leads Protest On Belarus Border
RSF ranked Belarus 158th out of 180 in the world in its 2021 World Press Freedom Index. 
On Monday, amid a growing international uproar over the grounding of the Ryanair flight, Lukashenko approved 
legislation that would ban reporters from providing real-time coverage of unauthorised mass protests. 
Any Belarusian national -- not just a journalist -- is banned from covering an unauthorised rally or using 
crowdfunding to pay fines over the violation of legislation on mass gatherings, according to the legal amendments 
published by state media. 
Speaking in Vilnius earlier on Thursday, Deloire said Belarusian journalists were facing a "disastrous situation". 
"We came here because we want to send a signal that we support the journalists in Belarus," he said.

'Nobody Is Safe' In Belarus, Says Independent Media Heiress Behind Tut.by

 The heiress to Belarus' largest independent news outlet, Evgeniya Chernyavskaya, says her country's widening 
crackdown on media and opposition has imperilled freedom of speech -- and threatened lives. 
"Nobody is safe now in Belarus -- especially journalists," says the heiress to Tut.by, the news outlet whose survival 
is now fragile, after members of its team were detained after office and home raids. 
On May 18 authorities blocked the site after searching and closing its offices and arresting 12 people, including 
several journalists and Yulia, Chernyavskaya's mother. 
Officially it was a tax evasion investigation -- but Chernyavskaya has no doubt that her country's most popular 
independent news site was targeted as part of Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko's crackdown, that followed 
mass protests in 2020 against his rule. 
Chernyavskaya, whose late father Yuri Zisser founded the news site, has been organising remotely from Tel Aviv in 
Israel, where she has lived for five years. 
In Belarus "there is no freedom of speech, no freedom to access information", the 33-year-old entrepreneur said, 
who until the raids had maintained a low profile.

from Tel Aviv Photo: AFP / JACK GUEZ  
"Belarus definitely has a dictatorship today -- it got worse during the last year, and it's very dangerous," she told 
AFP. 
 "Even people who go to the store to buy bread, they are unsafe, because they could be stopped, and their phone 
could be checked." 
The country's stifling of dissent escalated Sunday, when Belarus triggered international fury in arresting opposition 
blogger Roman Protasevich, after intercepting his Ryanair flight. 
"I would not be surprised if during the next two weeks, we will see that they just turn off the internet in Belarus," 
Chernyavskaya said. 
During the height of demonstrations last summer Belarus curbed internet access with "blackouts," which readers 
worked to bypass by relying on encrypted Telegram messaging as a tool of information and mobilisation. 
Chernyavskaya voiced hope that the recent acceleration of repressive measures could precipitate Lukashenko's 
fall, after 27 years in power.

"The more stupid and unbelievable and hard" things get in Belarus, the more it "destroys the power" of the regime, 
she said, speaking in English. 
She added she hopes that is the case, "because the other scenario is North Korea." 
Chernyavskaya, speaking from her Tel Aviv apartment some 2,500 kilometres (1,55 miles) away from Minsk, said 
she worries that airing these concerns could have consequences for her family, friends and employees. 
They are at the mercy of the Belarusian Financial Investigation Department -- part of the State Control Committee 
body regularly dispatched to attack the regime's critics. 
But the entrepreneur is spending her waking hours working to circulate news and photos using the primary tool left -
- social media. 
The 20-year-old Tut.by, the biggest independent media in Belarus, has "never been in the opposition", she said -- 
adding that the country doesn't truly have "an opposition." 
"It's just the government and the rest of the people against it," she said. 
With its website, social media and through Telegram messages, Tut.by's newsroom offered in-depth coverage of 
the 2020 demonstrations and the repression that followed, in particular the jailing and forced exile of journalists and 
state dissidents. 
The news site was already under judicial scrutiny. 
On March 2, a court slapped journalist Katerina Borisevich -- who was accused of leaking medical records of a 
protester who died during the rallies -- with six months in jail. 
"People were shot in the street, and we reported about it," said Chernyavskaya. 
According to her, even the regime's traditional supporters are tired. 
Even "the oldest women" in the most rural area "doesn't believe in Lukashenko anymore," she said.

 The UN civil aviation agency announced Thursday it will investigate Belarus's diversion of a Ryanair plane and the

diplomatic row. 
The G7 global powers also demanded Minsk release the journalist, Roman Protasevich, and the EU's foreign policy

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council, based in Montreal, "decided to undertake a fact-
finding investigation of this event," it said in a statement. 
It added that, at a meeting, the body "underlined the importance of establishing the facts of what happened, and of 
understanding whether there had been any breach by any ICAO Member State of international aviation law." 
Belarus's strongman President Alexander Lukashenko, who enjoys strong support from Moscow, sparked 
international outrage by dispatching a fighter jet Sunday to intercept a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius carrying 
Protasevich, 26, and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, 23.

A nervous-looking Protasevich was last seen in a video released by Belarusian authorities on Monday in which he 
was seen supposedly admitting to helping to organise mass unrest, a charge that could land him in jail for 15 years. 
"I want you to relay our appeal everywhere, throughout the world, to government representatives, to EU countries, 
to EU leaders, to US leaders: I am appealing, I am begging, help me free my son," his mother Natalia told 
journalists in Warsaw, visibly moved.

 Roman's father, Dmitry on Thursday said his son was "a tough man" and "a hero". 
"Throughout his life he fought for the truth and passed it on to people, which is why Lukashenko committed this 
despicable act," he said. 
The couple and their lawyer confirmed that they have not had any communication with their son since his arrest.

UN Aviation Body To Launch Probe Into Belarus Plane Diversion
Foreign ministers of the Group of Seven wealthy nations on Thursday demanded the "immediate and unconditional 
release" of Protasevich, "as well as all other journalists and political prisoners held in Belarus", in a joint statement 
published by the British government. 
The European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Thursday that proposals were "on the table" to target 
key sectors of the Belarusian economy. 
Borrell mooted targeting the potash fertiliser sector or refusing gas being delivered to the bloc via Belarus over the 
"hijacking" of the plane by the regime.

He was echoed by German Foreign Minister Heiko Mass, who also raised the possibility of hitting key firms in the 
fertiliser sector and said the EU could curb the Belarusian government's ability to issue bonds in Europe. 
But he played down the likelihood of the bloc agreeing quickly to reject gas transiting through pipelines in Belarus, 
insisting it was "more of a medium and long-term issue".

The bloc was also looking at "targeted sanctions" against the Belarusian authorities to add to the 88 regime figures 
and seven companies already on a blacklist over a brutal crackdown on the opposition after last year's disputed 
presidential election. 
At a briefing in Vilnius, where she fled to after last year's election, exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana 
Tikhanovskaya on Thursday called for an "economic boycott of the regime". 
Christophe Deloire, the head of media rights watchdog Reporters Sans Frontieres (Reporters Without Borders) was 
also in Lithuania to file a legal complaint against Lukashenko with prosecutors investigating Sunday's incident. 
Later on Thursday he protested on the Belarusian border along with dozens of Belarusian and Lithuanian 
journalists. 
The ICAO, of which Belarus is a member, has no power to order sanctions and Russia's support for Minsk means 
the UN Security Council is unlikely to agree on a collective statement. 
However EU countries are banning Belarusian carriers and the EU has also urged airlines to avoid Belarusian 
airspace. 
On Thursday, Austrian Airlines said it had cancelled a Vienna-Moscow flight after Russian authorities did not 
approve a route change for it to avoid Belarusian airspace. 
An Air France flight from Paris to Moscow on Wednesday had to be cancelled for the same reason. 
A defiant Lukashenko said he had "acted lawfully to protect our people" from an alleged bomb threat on the plane, 
in an address to parliament on Wednesday. 
The criticism was nothing more than another attempt by his opponents to undermine his rule, he added. 
Lukashenko -- often dubbed "Europe's last dictator" -- is facing some of the strongest international pressure of his 
nearly 27 years ruling ex-Soviet Belarus. 
He and his allies are already under a series of Western sanctions over a brutal crackdown on mass protests that 
followed his disputed re-election to a sixth term last August. 
But he continues to enjoy solid support from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is hosting the Belarusian leader 
on Friday.

 The UN civil aviation agency will hold an urgent meeting Thursday to discuss Belarus after Western powers on the 
UN Security Council called for the body to investigate Minsk's diversion of a European flight and arrest of a 
dissident. 
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council will meet as the consequences of the incident play out 
in Europe's airspace, with a Barcelona-bound flight from Minsk refused access to French airspace, and Poland 
banning Belarusian carriers on Wednesday.

But a defiant President Alexander Lukashenko said he had "acted lawfully to protect our people", in an address to 
parliament on Wednesday. 
In his first public statement since the Ryanair flight was diverted and opposition journalist and activist Roman 
Protasevich and his girlfriend were arrested on Sunday, Lukashenko dismissed the international outcry. 
The criticism was nothing more than another attempt by his opponents to undermine his rule, he said, accusing 
them of waging a "modern, hybrid war" against Belarus and of crossing "boundaries of common sense and human 
morality".

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday there was no reason to doubt Lukashenko's version of events.

The ICAO, of which Belarus is a member state, said on Monday that it was "strongly concerned by the apparent 
forced landing."

UN Aviation Body To Meet Over Belarus Plane Diversion
Under the 1944 convention that established the ICAO, every state has sovereignty over the airspace above its 
territory. 
But the text also says signatories must "refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight 
and that, in the case of interception, the lives of persons on board and the safety of aircraft must not be 
endangered". 
The Athens-to-Vilnius flight was diverted over a supposed bomb scare, with Lukashenko scrambling a MiG-29 
fighter jet to accompany the aircraft.

Lukashenko on Wednesday denied that the fighter jet had forced the airliner to land, calling such claims an 
"absolute lie". 
Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania had denied the Ryanair flight permission to land and its only option was to turn to 
Minsk, he said. 
Once the plane landed, Protasevich -- the 26-year-old co-founder of opposition Telegram channel Nexta that 
coordinated protests last year against Lukashenko -- and his Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega were arrested.

The ICAO has no power to impose sanctions. But European leaders this week agreed to cut air links with Belarus 
and told airlines to avoid the country's airspace. 
On Wednesday, a Minsk-to-Barcelona passenger flight by Belarusian state carrier Belavia was forced to turn back 
after being denied entry to French airspace, while Poland banned Belarusian flights from using its airspace. 
Opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said that flight bans should not stop Belarusians from being able to flee 
the regime. 
But she said she supported the EU's actions as "reasonable" and that Belarusians "cannot blame anyone for this 
except the regime". 
Protasevich was last seen in a video on Monday in which he admitted to helping to organise mass unrest, a charge 
that could land him in jail for 15 years. 
His father Dmitry said that his son's lawyer was told that the journalist was not in his detention cell. 
"We think that he may be in hospital," he told AFP. "We believe his life and health could be in danger." 
Sapega, a 23-year-old law student at the European Humanities University (EHU) in Lithuania, appeared in another 
video on Tuesday saying she worked for a Telegram channel that disclosed information about Belarusian law 
enforcement. 
Her lawyer said she had been remanded in pre-trial detention for two months and Russia confirmed she was being 
detained as a criminal suspect. 
Belarus's opposition says such videos are routinely recorded by security forces, with participants forced to make 
statements under duress. 
Last year's months of protests against Lukashenko, which involved tens of thousands of people, were brutally 
quashed and thousands were detained. 
Several people died in the unrest, with many reporting torture and abuse in custody. 
On Wednesday, dozens of people marched through the streets of Beryozovka east of Minsk for the funeral of Vitold 
Ashurok, 50, a well-known opposition activist who died Sunday from cardiac arrest in a penal colony in eastern 
Belarus. 
The Belarusian opposition has called for further international action against the regime. 
The call at the UN for the ICAO investigation echoes an earlier one from NATO. But Russia's support for Minsk 
means the UN Security Council is unlikely to agree a collective statement.

Talk about closing the stable door after the horse has kicked holes in the walls, scared the farm hands and bolted 
back to the steppe. Rishi Sunak is mooting a national security provision to block companies from listing on the 
London Stock Exchange. This appears aimed at businesses from the former Soviet Union linked to regimes there. 
Only recent air piracy by Belarus gives this belated move a sheen of timeliness.
Any such law would be a companion to a recent national security law. This gives the UK wide powers to scrutinise 
and block takeovers that might deliver sensitive technologies to its rivals. Here, China is the implicit threat.
A growing split between democratic and authoritarian powers is proving a great antidote to moral relativism. Ex- 
Soviet companies have been linked to regimes for as long as Chinese business has been buying or appropriating 
western trade secrets. Previously, western businesses would shrug and talk of "cultural differences".
The current shift has more to do with consolidation of power by China and Russia than painful experience over the 
past two decades. Several businesses from former Soviet countries listed in London, notably FTSE 100 member 
Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. Revelations over appalling governance showed the different expectations of 
oligarchs and
City investors. ENRC delisted. EN+ is still on the market. Oleg Deripaska floated global depositary receipts in the 
energy company in London in 2017. The Russian tycoon's supposed ties to President Vladimir Putin, which he 
denies, have raised eyebrows. He is subject to sanctions in the US.
London is also a venue for $1.25bn of eurobonds issued by Belarus. The west is furious with President Alexander 
Lukashenko for commandeering a Ryanair flight in order to arrest a critic.
UK listing rules: off target Twitter : @FTLex
Usually corporate governance is the bailiwick of the Financial Conduct Authority. Preserving national security falls 
to the government. Blocking listings is no way to foil spooks.
It is, however, clear to the City which countries have least-favoured nation status. Ministers had previously left 
banks and exchanges to make their own judgments. Goldman Sachs, for example, smartly withdrew from one float 
when some alleged underworld links surfaced. The City failed to raise eastern businesses' low standards of 
governance. These now figure more as a threat than an opportunity.

Ryanair chief accuses Irish government of doing damage to aviation
Ryanair chief accuses Irish government of doing damage to aviation

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC's boss has accused the Irish government of bringing "untold damage" on 
the aviation and tourism sector.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary also criticised Transport Minister Eamon Ryan for having no "plan, policy or 
commitment" on aviation.
The airline boss made the comments after he called on the government to announce an "immediate rescue plan" 
for Irish aviation and tourism.
On Friday, the government is to confirm its plan to ease more restrictions in June and July.
Taoiseach Micheal Martin will announce details on the full reopening of the hospitality sector, international travel 
and sports and cultural events.
O'Leary called for Martin to restore the UK Common Travel Area on June 1, describing it as "bizarre and untenable" 
that UK visitors arriving into the Republic have to undergo quarantine.
He also said that passengers travelling between Ireland and other EU member states should not be subject to hotel 
quarantine or coronavirus restrictions.
O'Leary also referenced the number of people who have received Covid-19 vaccines in Ireland and the low number 
of patients with the virus in hospital.
He also accused the National Public Health Emergency Team of "promulgating scare stories" about the variant 
predominantly found in India.
"This government has visited untold damage on Irish aviation and tourism," O'Leary said in a statement.
"Ireland has a Minister for Transport who has no plan, no policy and no commitment to aviation.
Ryanair chief accuses Irish government of doing damage to aviation
"Ireland is an island on the periphery of Europe, yet our transport minister has sat on an aviation recovery plan 
since July 2020, but taken no action at all.
"Ryanair has no faith in Minister Eamonn Ryan, who has shown himself to be ineffective and not up to the job, even 
while Irish airlines are closing bases here, and moving aircraft and jobs overseas to the UK and Europe.
"It is time for Micheal Martin's government to introduce an emergency rescue plan for Irish aviation and tourism.
"Staycations may fill some hotels in the south and west of Ireland during July and August, but it will not fill the hotels 
of Dublin, and nor will it support Irish tourism once the schools reopen in September.
"Since our minister for transport is incapable or unwilling to act, Micheal Martin and Leo Varadkar must now take 
charge and reopen Ireland from the UK from Tuesday and to and from the EU from July 1."
A spokesperson for Minister Ryan said he makes "no apologies for the public health measures approved by the 
cabinet to protect the Irish public during the pandemic."
They added: "He also appreciates the frustration of those who work in the aviation and related sectors.
"As Ryanair is well aware, Minister Ryan has been a firm advocate of a safe and planned return to international 
travel.
"Ryanair is also well aware that the government will take a decision tomorrow in this regard, and that the 
government has committed to the implementation of the EU Digital Covid Certificate and other measures to ease 
restrictions.
"In addition Ryanair has benefited from extensive supports from the Irish government to the aviation sector, which 
means the Irish taxpayer, throughout the pandemic."

Alexander Lukashenko has accused the west of staging a "planned provocation" that he claimed forced Belarus to 
intercept a Ryanair flight carrying a prominent dissident at the weekend. In his first comments since he sent a 
fighter jet to escort the Lithuania-bound plane to Minsk, the Belarus president told parliament yesterday that he had 
"acted legally, protecting people according to all international laws".
The Kremlin said there was "no reason not to trust" what Lukashenko said but others, including Nato and Greece, 
where the plane first took off, disputed his account.
Lukashenko defended his country's arrest of dissident blogger Roman Protasevich, which opposition leaders and 
western governments said was the real reason for the forced landing, as the country's "sovereign right".
He claimed Minsk air traffic control had passed on a warning of a bomb threat it received from Switzerland. 
Belarusian officials previously said the threat had come from Palestinian militant group Hamas, which has denied 
involvement, via the Switzerland-based encrypted email service ProtonMail.
ProtonMail said: "We haven't seen credible evidence that the claims are true but there is plenty of evidence to 
support the contrary."
Lukashenko said the Ryanair pilots had made their own decision to land the plane, en route from Athens, in Minsk, 
despite being much closer to its destination, the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, at the time. The former collective farm 
boss, who has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for 27 years, denied claims by Ryanair passengers that they had been

He said Athens and Vilnius airports had also received the bomb threat and had refused to let the plane land in 
Vilnius. However, Greece disputed that account, with the foreign ministry saying the country "sticks to the statement 
made last Sunday, describing the incident as a state-sponsored hijacking".
Lithuanian authorities declined to comment due to their live criminal investigation into the incident. But Gabrielius 
Landsbergis, foreign minister, said: "Terrorist is what terrorist does or intends to do."
Nato, meanwhile, described the act as "unacceptable" and said it supported calls for an urgent independent 
investigation. Lukashenko also suggested critics of Belarus should have been grateful he did not order the plane to 
be shot down as it flew close to a nuclear power plant.
"Was Chernobyl not enough?," he said. "If there was a bomb on board the plane and terrorists wanted to blow it up, 
we couldn't really have helped. But I couldn't let the plane fall on our people's heads."
Western nations have condemned the flight's forced landing and called for the immediate release of Protasevich 
and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, who was also on the flight. The couple were detained immediately after the plane 
landed in Minsk and were recorded in jail confessing to "organising mass disturbances".
Belarus placed Protasevich and the co-founder of Nexta, the Poland-based dissident media group where the 26-
year-old blogger was previously editor, on a terrorist watchlist in November.
Lukashenko implied that Nexta was being directed by western intelligence to destabilise Belarus as a testing 
ground for future attacks on its ally, Russia.
"I'd like to remind you that one wellknown channel that started out covering Belarusian issues, but not on our land, 
is already working full out against Russia, thus showing the true goal of western strategists," he said.
"Their goal is to dissolve the Belarusian people and move on to smothering their arch-enemy: the Russian."

Belarus placed Protasevich and the co-founder of Nexta, the Poland-based dissident media group where the 26-
year-old blogger was previously editor, on a terrorist watchlist in November.
Lukashenko implied that Nexta was being directed by western intelligence to destabilise Belarus as a testing 
ground for future attacks on its ally, Russia.
"I'd like to remind you that one wellknown channel that started out covering Belarusian issues, but not on our land, 
is already working full out against Russia, thus showing the true goal of western strategists," he said.
"Their goal is to dissolve the Belarusian people and move on to smothering their arch-enemy: the Russian."

Talk about closing the stable door after the horse has kicked holes in the walls, scared the farm hands and bolted 
back to the steppe. Rishi Sunak is mooting a national security provision to block companies from listing on the 
London Stock Exchange. This appears aimed at businesses from the former Soviet Union linked to regimes there. 
Only recent air piracy by Belarus gives this belated move a sheen of timeliness.
Any such law would be a companion to a recent national security law. This gives the UK wide powers to scrutinise 
and block takeovers that might deliver sensitive technologies to its rivals. Here, China is the implicit threat.
A growing split between democratic and authoritarian powers is proving a great antidote to moral relativism. Ex- 
Soviet companies have been linked to regimes for as long as Chinese business has been buying or appropriating 
western trade secrets. Previously, western businesses would shrug and talk of "cultural differences".
The current shift has more to do with consolidation of power by China and Russia than painful experience over the 
past two decades. Several businesses from former Soviet countries listed in London, notably FTSE 100 member 
Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. Revelations over appalling governance showed the different expectations of 
oligarchs and
City investors. ENRC delisted. EN+ is still on the market. Oleg Deripaska floated global depositary receipts in the 
energy company in London in 2017. The Russian tycoon's supposed ties to President Vladimir Putin, which he 
denies, have raised eyebrows. He is subject to sanctions in the US.
London is also a venue for $1.25bn of eurobonds issued by Belarus. The west is furious with President Alexander 
Lukashenko for commandeering a Ryanair flight in order to arrest a critic.

Usually corporate governance is the bailiwick of the Financial Conduct Authority. Preserving national security falls 
to the government. Blocking listings is no way to foil spooks.
It is, however, clear to the City which countries have least-favoured nation status. Ministers had previously left 
banks and exchanges to make their own judgments. Goldman Sachs, for example, smartly withdrew from one float 
when some alleged underworld links surfaced. The City failed to raise eastern businesses' low standards of 
governance. These now figure more as a threat than an opportunity.
Vivendi/Bluebell: music to activist ears
Like the flower, the small activist fund Bluebell Capital blooms in the spring. Italian-owned Bluebell has a small 
stake in French media conglomerate
Vivendi, which has plans to spin out its largest asset, Universal Music Group. Bluebell approves of that but 
disagrees with the process. It wants money upfront to offset any possible tax liabilities. Putting aside Bluebell's 
mere (EURO)70m of assets, even getting proposals on to the agenda for next month's annual meeting will be 
tough.
Bluebell has managed to blossom under big trees in the past. It won a battle to replace Danone's chief executive. 
Bluebell's partners, which include the former chief executive of jewellery maker Bulgari, Francesco Trapani, have 
been active with bank Monte dei Paschi. Last year, Bluebell's fund eked out a 5.7 per cent return.
Its activist grievance is threefold.
Vivendi's UMG deal will generate tax liabilities for other shareholders, apart from Vivendi and its controlling 
shareholder Vincent Bolloré. Also it fears that Vivendi, which had already increased its authorised buyback, aims to 
increase Bolloré's control of the company without any mandatory bid to minority shareholders. Finally, the listing of 
the new UMG shares will be in Amsterdam whereas a listing in New York should achieve a higher valuation.
On the first complaint, Bluebell has asked for a special dividend of (EURO)2.8 per share, worth (EURO)3.3bn. This 
would offset any tax liabilities for shareholders.
Paying that cash should also limit funds for any buyback of the shares of the Vivendi rump. As for Amsterdam, it 
may be too www.late.No matter what, any AGM agenda items will need approval in the next week, explaining this 
week's media blitz by Bluebell about Vivendi. Shareholders' choice comes down to either paying some tax to 
receive shares in Universal Music or blocking its spinout at the AGM. The latter means remaining in Vivendi with a 
conglomerate discount, an unhappy result. Gardeners should prefer a small harvest to none at all.
Spire/Ramsay: hospital drama
Australia's Ramsay Health Care has delivered a shot in the arm to Spire Healthcare. Its all-cash bid values the 
group at £2bn. The UK private hospital operator has lurched from crisis to crisis since a bid from its largest 
shareholder Mediclinic failed in 2017.
Ramsay's offer carries a decent premium. But with Spire shares still in recovery from last year's shutdown, the offer 
smacks of opportunism.
Spire had a decent run in the years following its 2014 initial public offering. The wheels began to come off in 2017 
as NHS cutbacks in private treatments curbed earnings. This was compounded by the jailing of rogue surgeon Ian 
Paterson, who worked from Spire's hospitals. Mediclinic, sniffing opportunity, launched its abortive bid, which 
valued Spire shares at 316 pence apiece.
Ramsay's 240 pence per share offer is at a 36 per cent premium to Spire's share price over the past three months. 
Using consensus estimates for 2022 gives an enterprise value multiple of 9.6 times expected ebitda. That is well 
above levels Spire shares traded at even during pre-crisis lulls of 2018 and 2019 but below Ramsay's own 11 times 
multiple.
UK listing rules: off target Twitter : @FTLex
Since taking the helm in 2017, Justin
Ash has sought to ensure there can be no repeat of the lapses that allowed Paterson to abuse patients. Quality of 
care metrics have improved. So too have financial prospects, with a backlog of elective surgeries from last year set 
to boost activity. Analysts expect ebitda margins of 20 per cent in 2023, levels not seen for a decade.
Ramsay is unlikely to face competition to buy Spire and Mediclinic has committed to tendering its 30 per cent 
holding. That is lucky for Ramsay, as it would struggle to pay more.
Even with its improving prospects, shareholders are still subject to a market that is susceptible to all manner of 
risks. Better to take the medicine on the table, even if the sugar coating is a little thin this time round.

 Chief Executive Michael O'Leary called the recent forced landing of a Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) flight by 
Belarusian authorities "premeditated and unlawful" hijacking and rejected the country's reason for the action, The 
Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.
In a letter sent to the director of Belarus' department of aviation, O'Leary said the forced landing in Minsk on the 
pretext of an alleged bomb threat was "an illegal and reprehensible action."
Belarus' actions were termed "a serious attack on the rules governing civil aviation" by the Group of Seven 
industrialized nations and the European Union's foreign policy chief.
The budget airline's stock climbed almost 2% on Thursday's close.

'This is total insanity,' says father of detained Belarusian journalist

May 27, 2021( EU Reporter: http://www.eureporter.co Delivered by Newstex)  
 The father of dissident journalist Roman Protasevich, who was detained in Belarus after his plane was forced to 
land there, said he believes his son was forced in a video posted online to admit guilt and appeared to have a 
broken nose, writes Andrius Sytas. 
The Lithuania-based blogger and his female companion, Sofia Sapega, were both taken into custody after Belarus 
scrambled a warplane to intercept a Ryanair aircraft flying from Athens to Vilnius and divert it to Minsk on Sunday in 
an action condemned by the European Union and the United States. 
Appearing on several channels of the Telegram messaging app on Monday, Protasevich, 26, acknowledged playing 
a role in organising mass disturbances in Minsk last year. 
His social media feed from exile has been one of the last remaining independent outlets for news about the country 
since a mass crackdown on dissent last year. 
To his father, Dzmitry Protasevich, the video comments on Monday seemed to be a result of coercion. 
"It's likely his nose is broken, because the shape of it has changed and there's a lot of powder on it. All of the left 
side of his face has powder," the elder Protasevich told Reuters in an interview in Russian late on Monday from 
Wroclaw, Poland, where he and his wife live. 
"It's not his words, it's not his intonation of speech. He is acting very reserved and you can see he is nervous," 
Protasevich said of his son. "And it's not his pack of cigarettes on the table - he doesn't smoke these. So I think he 
was forced." 
The father added: "My son cannot admit to creating the mass disorders, because he just didn't do any such thing." 
'This is total insanity,' says father of detained Belarusian journalist
Belarus' Interior Ministry said Protasevich was being held in jail and had not complained of ill health. 
The 27 national leaders of the European Union on Monday demanded the immediate release of Protasevich and 
Sapega, as well as an investigation by the International Civil Aviation Organization into the incident. 
They also agreed to impose more sanctions on Belarus, called on their airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace and 
authorised work to ban Belarusian airlines from European skies and airports, a spokesman said. 
The EU, along with the United States, Britain and Canada had already imposed asset freezes and travel bans on 
almost 90 Belarusian officials, including President Alexander Lukashenko, following an August election that 
opponents and the West say was a sham. 
The president has denied electoral fraud. Since the disputed vote, authorities have rounded up thousands of his 
opponents, with all major opposition figures now in jail or exile. 
"We are surprised that the destiny of one person means a lot, that it is seen as valuable to the European Union," 
Dzmitry Protasevich said. "This is something that is lost in Belarus." 
"I think what happened was an act of revenge, to enlighten others: Look what we can do," he said. "This is total 
insanity, what is going on."

Shortly after Belarus forced a Ryanair flight en route to Lithuania to land in Minsk this week so the authorities could 
arrest journalist and opposition activist Roman Protasevich and his partner, someone asked on Twitter: "Any 
precedent for a country forcing down a civilian airliner in its airspace to arrest a dissident?"
I knew the answer was yes, because I was on a flight 50 years ago when a similar act of state-organised air piracy 
took place. BOAC Flight 045 was heading from London to Khartoum via Rome on July 22 1971 when it was ordered 
to land in Benghazi by the Libyan regime of Muammer Gaddafi as it crossed Libyan airspace.
Two men, who turned out to be among the leaders of an abortive coup d'état in neighbouring Sudan, were taken off 
the plane, before being returned to Sudan and immediately executed on the orders of the newly restored president, 
Jaafar al-Nimeiri.

passengers. In both cases, the commercial pilot was about to leave the national airspace when ordered to turn 
around.

In neither case did the pilots at first know the true reason for the forced diversion, although in 1971 the captain 
spoke to the two targeted Sudanese men before the landing and they told him to do nothing that might endanger 
the other passengers, according to Flight International at the time.
Sometimes governments kill or detain airline passengers by accident as an unintended byproduct of conflict. 
Among these catastrophes are Malaysia Airlines flight 17, shot down over eastern Ukraine by
Russian-backed rebels in 2014; the Iran Air Airbus shot down over the Gulf by a US warship in 1988; and Korean

were killed.
As a journalist covering the Middle East, I was on British Airways flight 149 from London to Kuwait, Madras and 
Kuala Lumpur when it landed in Kuwait in the early hours of August 2 1990. Most of the 385 passengers and crew 
were taken hostage by Saddam Hussein's Iraqi forces who had invaded Kuwait overnight - except those, like me, 
whose destination was
Kuwait itself and who had left the airport by the time the plane was seized. The jetliner was later destroyed on the 
ground. Some hostages were held for months, but all were eventually released. After 10 days of reporting, I 
escaped across the desert to Saudi Arabia.
The Belarus incident is particularly sinister because it shows how far some governments are prepared to go to 
neutralise their opponents. Russia, Iran, Israel and the US have frequently assassinated their enemies in foreign 
countries, while China has kidnapped its opponents and brought them home to be punished. People on commercial 
flights are an easy target for an unscrupulous www.state.No airline pilot could reasonably be expected to call the 
bluff of a government threatening his aircraft, risking the lives of all the passengers and crew - and that is why the
Belarus incident is so serious. It undermines the accepted notion that people can travel freely between two points 
without risk of being arrested or killed by the government of a country over which they happen to be flying.
When researching the Libya incident of 1971, I was surprised to find that it is not mentioned in Wikipedia's "list of 
aircraft hijackings". Belarus's diversion of the Ryanair plane is on the list. That is as it should be. A hijack by a 
government is still a hijack.

Shortly after Belarus forced a Ryanair flight en route to Lithuania to land in Minsk this week so the authorities could

precedent for a country forcing down a civilian airliner in its airspace to arrest a dissident?"

took place. BOAC Flight 045 was heading from London to Khartoum via Rome on July 22 1971 when it was ordered 
to land in Benghazi by the Libyan regime of Muammer Gaddafi as it crossed Libyan airspace.
Two men, who turned out to be among the leaders of an abortive coup d'état in neighbouring Sudan, were taken off

 Austrian Airlines, owned by Lufthansa (LHA.F), canceled flight activity to Moscow, as new routes to the Russian 
capital avoiding Belarusian airspace were not approved by the Kremlin, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.
The move comes after European Union governments asked airlines within the bloc not to fly over Belarus, as a 
response to the diversion of a Ryanair (RYA.L) flight carrying an opposition journalist onboard, ordered by 
Belarusian authorities on Sunday.
Flights operated by British Airways, owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG.L, IAG.MC), however, 
were allowed to land in Russia via flight routes different than the usual.
On Wednesday, Air France, part of Air France-KLM (AF.PA), called off AF1154, a flight bound for Moscow from 
Paris.

 The heiress to Belarus' largest independent news outlet, Evgeniya Chernyavskaya, says her country's widening 
crackdown on media and opposition has imperilled freedom of speech — and threatened lives. 
 'Nobody is safe now in Belarus — especially journalists,' says the heiress to Tut.by, the news outlet whose survival 
is now fragile, after members of its team were detained after office and home raids. 
 On May 18 authorities blocked the site after searching and closing its offices and arresting 12 people, including 
several journalists and Yulia, Chernyavskaya's mother. 
 Officially it was a tax evasion investigation — but Chernyavskaya has no doubt that her country's most popular 
independent news site was targeted as part of Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko's crackdown, that followed 
mass protests in 2020 against his rule. 
 Chernyavskaya, whose late father Yuri Zisser founded the news site, has been organising remotely from Tel Aviv 
in Israel, where she has lived for five years. 
 In Belarus 'there is no freedom of speech, no freedom to access information', the 33-year-old entrepreneur said, 
who until the raids had maintained a low profile. 
 'Belarus definitely has a dictatorship today — it got worse during the last year, and it's very dangerous,' she told 
AFP. 
 'Even people who go to the store to buy bread, they are unsafe, because they could be stopped, and their phone 
could be checked.' 
 The country's stifling of dissent escalated Sunday, when Belarus triggered international fury in arresting opposition 
blogger Roman Protasevich, after intercepting his Ryanair flight. 
 'I would not be surprised if during the next two weeks, we will see that they just turn off the internet in Belarus,' 
Chernyavskaya said. 
 - 'North Korea' - 
During the height of demonstrations last summer Belarus curbed internet access with 'blackouts,' which readers 
worked to bypass by relying on encrypted Telegram messaging as a tool of information and mobilisation. 
 Chernyavskaya voiced hope that the recent acceleration of repressive measures could precipitate Lukashenko's 
fall, after 27 years in power. 
'Nobody is safe' in Belarus , says independent media heiress behind Tut.by
 'The more stupid and unbelievable and hard' things get in Belarus, the more it 'destroys the power' of the regime, 
she said, speaking in English. 
 She added she hopes that is the case, 'because the other scenario is North Korea.' 
 Chernyavskaya, speaking from her Tel Aviv apartment some 2,500 kilometres (1,55 miles) away from Minsk, said 
she worries that airing these concerns could have consequences for her family, friends and employees. 
 They are at the mercy of the Belarusian Financial Investigation Department — part of the State Control Committee 
body regularly dispatched to attack the regime's critics. 
 But the entrepreneur is spending her waking hours working to circulate news and photos using the primary tool left 
— social media. 
 The 20-year-old Tut.by, the biggest independent media in Belarus, has 'never been in the opposition', she said — 
adding that the country doesn't truly have 'an opposition.' 
 'It's just the government and the rest of the people against it,' she said. 
 With its website, social media and through Telegram messages, Tut.by's newsroom offered in-depth coverage of 
the 2020 demonstrations and the repression that followed, in particular the jailing and forced exile of journalists and 
state dissidents. 
 The news site was already under judicial scrutiny. 
 On March 2, a court slapped journalist Katerina Borisevich — who was accused of leaking medical records of a 
protester who died during the rallies — with six months in jail. 
 'People were shot in the street, and we reported about it,' said Chernyavskaya. 
 According to her, even the regime's traditional supporters are tired. 
 Even 'the oldest women' in the most rural area 'doesn't believe in Lukashenko anymore,' she said.

 The UN civil aviation agency will hold an urgent meeting Thursday to discuss Belarus after Western powers on the 
UN Security Council called for the body to investigate Minsk's diversion of a European flight and arrest of a 
dissident. 
 The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council will meet as the consequences of the incident play out 
in Europe's airspace, with a Barcelona-bound flight from Minsk refused access to French airspace, and Poland 
banning Belarusian carriers on Wednesday. 
 But a defiant President Alexander Lukashenko said he had 'acted lawfully to protect our people', in an address to 
parliament on Wednesday. 
 In his first public statement since the Ryanair flight was diverted and opposition journalist and activist Roman 
Protasevich and his girlfriend were arrested on Sunday, Lukashenko dismissed the international outcry. 
 The criticism was nothing more than another attempt by his opponents to undermine his rule, he said, accusing 
them of waging a 'modern, hybrid war' against Belarus and of crossing 'boundaries of common sense and human 
morality'. 
 Lukashenko — often dubbed 'Europe's last dictator' — is facing some of the strongestinternational pressure of his 
nearly 27 years ruling ex-Soviet Belarus. 
 He and his allies are already under a series of Western sanctions over a brutal crackdown on mass protests that 
followed his disputed re-election to a sixth term last August. 
 But he continues to enjoy solid support from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is hosting the Belarusian leader 
on Friday. 
 Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday there was no reason to doubt Lukashenko's version of events. 
- Air links cut - 
The ICAO, of which Belarus is a member state, said on Monday that it was 'strongly concerned by the apparent 
forced landing.' 
 Under the1944 convention that established theICAO, every state has sovereignty over the airspace above its 
territory. 
UN aviation body to meet over Belarus plane diversion
 But the text also says signatories must 'refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight 
and that, in the case of interception, the lives of persons on board and the safety of aircraft must not be 
endangered'. 
 The Athens-to-Vilnius flight was diverted over a supposed bomb scare, with Lukashenko scrambling a MiG-29 
fighter jet to accompany the aircraft. 
 Lukashenko on Wednesday denied that the fighter jet had forced the airliner to land, calling such claims an 
'absolute lie'. 
 Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania had denied the Ryanair flight permission to land and its only option was to turn to 
Minsk, he said. 
 Once the plane landed, Protasevich — the 26-year-old co-founder of opposition Telegram channel Nexta that 
coordinated protests last year against Lukashenko — and his Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega were arrested. 
 The ICAO has no power to impose sanctions.But European leaders this week agreed to cut air links with Belarus 
and told airlines to avoid the country's airspace. 
 On Wednesday, a Minsk-to-Barcelona passenger flight by Belarusian state carrier Belavia was forced to turn back 
after being denied entry to French airspace, while Poland banned Belarusian flights from using its airspace. 
 Opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said that flight bans should not stop Belarusians from being able to flee 
the regime. 
 But she said she supported the EU's actions as 'reasonable' and that Belarusians 'cannot blame anyone for this 
except the regime'. 
- 'Life in danger' - 
Protasevich was last seen in a video on Monday in which he admitted to helping to organise mass unrest, a charge 
that could land him in jail for 15 years. 
 His father Dmitry said that his son's lawyer was told that the journalist was not in his detention cell. 
 'We think that he may be in hospital,' he told AFP. 'We believe his life and health could be in danger.' 
 Sapega, a 23-year-old law student at the European Humanities University (EHU) in Lithuania, appeared in another 
video on Tuesday saying she worked for a Telegram channel that disclosed information about Belarusian law 
enforcement. 
 Her lawyer said she had been remanded in pre-trial detention for two months and Russia confirmed she was being 
detained as a criminal suspect. 
 Belarus's opposition says such videos are routinely recorded by security forces, with participants forced to make 
statements under duress. 
 Last year's months of protests against Lukashenko, which involved tens of thousands of people, were brutally 
quashed and thousands were detained. 
 Several people died in the unrest, with many reporting torture and abuse in custody. 
 On Wednesday, dozens of people marched through the streets of Beryozovka east of Minsk for the funeral of 
Vitold Ashurok, 50, a well-known opposition activist who died Sunday from cardiac arrest in a penal colony in 
eastern Belarus. 
 The Belarusian opposition has called for further international action against the regime. 
 Tikhanovskaya on Wednesday urged the European Parliament to ban both new foreign investments in Belarus and 
the country's main exports. 
 The call at the UN for the ICAO investigation echoes an earlier one from NATO. But Russia's support for Minsk 
means the UN Security Council is unlikely to agree a collective statement.

 The head of Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF) protested on Thursday at the Belarusian border along 
with dozens of journalists after the arrest of anti-regime blogger Roman Protasevich. 
 RSF chief Christophe Deloire and the Belarusian and Lithuanian journalists placed portraits of their 21 colleagues 
imprisoned in Belarus on a fence along the EU border between Lithuania and Belarus. 
 Deloire called the government of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, in power since 1994, 'predators of 
the liberty of the press' and said the strongman was acting like a 'terrorist'. 
 Reporters Without Borders this week asked Lithuanian prosecutors to investigate Lukashenko's role in diverting the 
plane carrying Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega on Sunday. 
 There has been no contact with either of them since their arrest except for two supposed 'confession' videos 
released by Belarusian authorities. 
 'Lukashenko himself should be prosecuted, because what he has done, what he has clearly ordered and what he 
now justifies is plane hijacking with terrorist intentions and he is responsible,' Deloire, holding a photo of 
Protasevich, told AFP. 
 He said the international community should pressure on the regime to secure journalist's release. 
 'We will not forget you, we will continue to fight for you,' Deloire said. 
- A 'disastrous situation' - 
Standing at the border, Lithuanian journalist Sarunas Cerniauskas said this was 'as close as we can get to the 
regime'. 
 'But we really want to come closer when it comes to exposing the things that are going on in Belarus and all the 
abuses of human rights and the abuses of power,' said Cerniauskas, head of an investigative journalism centre in 
Lithuania. 
 Indre Makaraityte, who works for the Lithuanian national broadcaster, said: 'Any dictator and any tyrant is afraid of 
publicity'. 
 Belarusian journalist Maksim Tsikhenia, a correspondent for Belarusian media outlet Charter 97, called the events 
in Belarus 'terrible'.

 'By our presence, we want to declare the need to give freedom to independent journalists and independent 
journalism,' he said. 
 RSF ranked Belarus 158th out of 180 in the world in its 2021 World Press Freedom Index. 
 On Monday, amid a growing international uproar over the grounding of the Ryanair flight, Lukashenko approved 
legislation that would ban reporters from providing real-time coverage of unauthorised mass protests. 
 Any Belarusian national — not just a journalist — is banned from covering an unauthorised rally or using 
crowdfunding to pay fines over the violation of legislation on mass gatherings, according to the legal amendments 
published by state media. 
 Speaking in Vilnius earlier on Thursday, Deloire said Belarusian journalists were facing a 'disastrous situation'. 
 'We came here because we want to send a signal that we support the journalists in Belarus,' he said.

 Air France called off AF1154, a flight bound for Moscow from Paris on Wednesday after Russia failed to give its 
nod to a new route which skirts Belarus, Reuters reported Wednesday, citing a spokesman from the French carrier.
The European Union has compelled its airlines to steer clear of Belarus and its airspace after the country forced a 
Ryanair jet bound to Lithuania to land to effect the arrest of a journalist on board the plane. Air France, part of Air 
France-KLM (AF.PA) said it plans to continue its next scheduled flight on Moscow on Friday if Russia approves the 
new route skipping Belarus.
Following the cancellation, Belavia flight 2869 headed to Barcelona was forced to return to Minsk after Poland said 
it would not be able to enter French airspace.
Air France-KLM's stock dropped by over 1% on Wednesday's close.

 'Belarus is becoming the North Korea of Europe: nontransparent, unpredictable and dangerous'[1] 
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the elected leader of Belarus who is now living in exile was invited to an exchange of 
views with members of the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday (26 May). 
The meeting took place following recent events in Belarus, including the unprecedented forced landing of the 
Ryanair flight in Minsk Belarus and the detention by Belarusian authorities of journalist Raman Pratasevich and 
Sofia Sapega. 
Tsikhanouskaya said: 'Since the rigged elections of August 2020, the regime has completely lost the boundaries of 
acceptable behavior. Let us be frank, the previous EU strategy of wait and see towards the Belarusian regime 
doesn't work. 
'The EU approach of gradually elevated pressure on the Lukashenko regime has not managed to change his 
behavior and has only led to a growing sense of impunity and messy repressions. 
'I call on the European Parliament to make sure that the reaction of the international community is not limited to the 
Ryanair flight incident. The response must address the situation in Belarus in its entirety, or we will all face such 
situations in the future, Lukashenko is turning my country into the North Korea of Europe: nontransparent, 
unpredictable and dangerous.' 
Tsikhanouskaya highlighted three other recent developments: the elimination of Tutby media; the death of political 
activist Vitold Ashurak in prison custody; and the decision to delay the next national vote until the end of 2023.

 Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko (pictured) said on Wednesday (26 May) a journalist pulled off a plane 
that was forced to land in Minsk had been plotting a rebellion, and he accused the West of waging a hybrid war 
against him, write Tom Balmforth and Maria Kiselyova. 
 In his first public remarks since a Belarusian warplane intercepted a Ryanair flight on Sunday between European 
Union members Greece and Lithuania, he showed no hint of backing down from confrontation with countries that 
accuse him of air piracy. 
 "As we predicted, our ill-wishers from outside the country and from inside the country changed their methods of 
attack on the state," Lukashenko told parliament. 
 "They have crossed many red lines and have abandoned common sense and human morals," he said, referring to 
a "hybrid war" without giving any details. 
Belarus has been subject to EU and US sanctions since Lukashenko cracked down on pro-democracy protests 
after a disputed election last year. But his decision to intercept an international airliner in Belarusian airspace and 
arrest a 26-year-old dissident journalist has brought vows of much more serious action. 
In his speech to parliament, Lukashenko gave no details of the "bloody rebellion" he accused journalist Roman 
Protasevich of planning. 
 Protasevich, whose social media feed from exile had been one of the last remaining independent sources of news 
about Belarus, was shown on state TV on Monday confessing to organising demonstrations. 
 But Belarus opposition figures dismissed the confession, seeing the video as evidence Protasevich had been 
tortured, an allegation repeated by his mother, Natalia. 
"I simply plead with all the international community... please, world, stand up and help, I beg you so much because 
they will kill him," she told Polish broadcaster TVN. 
Belarus leader says detained journalist was plotting 'bloody rebellion'
Late on Tuesday, state TV broadcast a similar confession video of Sophia Sapega, a 23-year-old student arrested 
with Protasevich. Read more https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/companion-detained-dissident-

 Germany led condemnation of Belarus over the videotapes, which Lukashenko's opponents said were recorded 
under coercion. 
 "We condemn in the strongest possible terms the Belarusian rulers' practice of parading their prisoners in public 
with so-called 'confessions," German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said. 
Belarus denies it mistreats detainees. Rights groups have documented what they say are hundreds of cases of 
abuse and forced confessions since last year. 
Europe's aviation regulator issued a bulletin on Wednesday urging all airlines to avoid Belarus airspace for safety 
reasons, saying the forced diversion of the Ryanair flight had put in question its ability to provide safe skies. Read

 Western governments have told their airlines to re-route flights to avoid Belarus's airspace and have announced 
plans to ban Belarusian planes. The European Union says other unspecified sanctions are also in the works. 
Credit rating agency S&#38;P Global signalled it could downgrade Belarus' credit rating if Western governments 
impose stronger economic sanctions. 
Lukashenko said he would respond harshly to any sanctions. His prime minister said the country could ban some 
imports and restrict transit in response, without giving details. 
 Landlocked Belarus is located between its ally Russia and the EU, and some Russian oil and gas flows through it. 
Last year, it retaliated for sanctions by limiting some oil export traffic through a port in Lithuania. 
 In his remarks to parliament, Lukashenko, 66, said street protests were no longer possible in Belarus. Most known 
opposition figures are now in jail or exile. 
In power since 1994, Lukashenko faced weeks of mass protests after he was declared the winner of a presidential 
election that his opponents said was rigged. The protests lost momentum after thousands of arrests in a police 
crackdown. 
Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said the opposition was now preparing a new phase of active 
protests. 
 "There's nothing more to wait for - we have to stop the terror once and for all," she said. 
 Western powers are seeking ways to increase the isolation of Lukashenko, who has previously shrugged off 
Western sanctions, which mostly consisted of placing officials on black lists. The West is wary of upsetting Moscow, 
which regards Belarus as a strategically important buffer. 
 U.S. President Joe Biden will discuss the incident with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit next month 
but the White House said it does not believe Moscow played any role in the incident. 
 Belarusian authorities on Tuesday released a transcript of a conversation between the Ryanair plane and an air 
traffic controller. In it, the controller tells the pilot of a bomb threat and advises him to land in Minsk. The pilot 
repeatedly questions the source of the information before agreeing to divert the plane. 
 The transcript, which Reuters could not independently verify, differed from excerpts released by Belarus state TV, 
which reported that the pilot had asked to land in Minsk, rather than that the controller advised him to do so. 
 The Ryanair plane remains in the Lithuanian capital's airport, where it flew after Minsk, while data is collected form 
it, the Lithuanian prosecutor's office said.

 Russia Thursday blocked at least two European planes from landing in Moscow because they planned to avoid 
Belarusian airspace after Belarus diverted a Lithuania-bound flight to detain a government dissident on Monday, 
U.S. News[1] reports. 
Why it matters: The move comes after the EU told European airlines not to fly over Belarus, and appears to seek to 
undermine the bloc's response to the country's strongman leader Aleksandr Lukashenko, an ally of Russian 
President Vladimir Putin. 
Context: EU leaders have described Lukashenko ordering the diversion of the Ryanair flight to arrest journalist 
Raman Pratasevich as a "hijacking," as did the CEO of Ryanair. Lukashenko claimed this week the action was 
necessary to quell a bomb threat.[2]The UN's civil aviation agency, the International Civil Aviation Organization 
(ICAO), said in a statement[3] the landing "could be in contravention of the Chicago Convention," a treaty protecting 
airspace sovereignty.The EU, in addition to telling European airlines not to fly over Belarus, banned Belarusian 
airlines and promised more economic sanctions on the country. The big picture: Russia on Thursday blocked an 
Austrian Airlines flight from Vienna and an Air France flight from Paris from landing in Moscow. The Kremlin denied 
any involvement in the detention of Pratasevich but did not criticize Lukashenko's actions. Go deeper ... Biden: U.S. 
will coordinate with the EU on Belarus response[4]

 The Austrian Airlines flight wanted to change its route to avoid Belarus, but Russia rejected this, the airline 
said.Austrian Airlines said it canceled a cargo-passenger flight from Vienna to Moscow on Thursday.  
Flight OS601 from Vienna was scheduled to arrive in Moscow on time, but the board at Domodedovo airport listed 
the flight as canceled. Earlier, the airline had refused to transit through Belarusian airspace on the way to Moscow. 
The European Union has urged its airlines to avoid Belarus and its airspace following Sunday's forced landing in 
Minsk of a Ryanair plane and the arrest of a dissident journalist on board. 
A representative of the Austrian Airlines told the Interfax news agency that the new flight route needed to be 
confirmed with the authorities. 
"The Russian authorities have not given us this permission," the spokeswoman was quoted as saying in the 
Russian-language report. 
Earlier, AirFrance also reported canceled flights to the Russian capital.  
EU foreign ministers mull sanctions 
Also on Thursday, EU foreign ministers in Lisbon vowed to continue to increase pressure on Belarusian President 
Alexander Lukashenko. Foreign ministers of the Group of Seven called for the "immediate and unconditional 
release" of Roman Pratasevich, the detained journalist.  
"We demand the immediate and unconditional release" of Pratasevich, "as well as all other journalists and political 
prisoners held in Belarus," the ministers said in a joint statement published by the British government. 
The parents of detained journalist Pratasevich also urged the international community to help free their son. 
"I want you to hear my cry, the cry of my soul. So that you understand how difficult it is for us now and how much 
we are experiencing this situation,'' Natalia Pratasevich, the reporter's mother, said at a news conference in Poland. 
"I am begging you, help me free my son.'' 
Kremlin is 'not in charge of controlling air traffic' 
Meanwhile, Press Secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov sidestepped the question of canceling flights 
by European air carriers.  
"The presidential administration is not in charge of controlling air traffic. We recommend you to address this 
question to our aviation authorities," Peskov told journalists, Interfax quoted him as saying.

 Russia is upping the ante on the European air wars. At least two European airlines were forced to cancel flights to 
Russia on Thursday after they were denied permission to enter Russian airspace, as they sought to reroute to avoid 
flying over Belarus. Airlines are bypassing Belarus after a Ryanair flight was essentially hijacked and forced to land 
in Minsk on Sunday in a ploy to arrest an opposition journalist who was on board. 
 On Wednesday, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency urged European carriers to avoid Belarusian airspace 
over safety concerns. A Belarusian fighter jet was scrambled to accompany the Ryanair flight to Minsk after pilots 
were falsely warned by Belarusian air traffic controllers that there was a bomb on board. 
 The Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich, who has lived in exile since 2019, was taken off the flight following 
the emergency landing in the Belarusian capital and arrested alongside his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, as they flew 
from Athens to Vilnius, Lithuania. 
 Both Air France and Austrian Airlines said that Russia had yet to approve their requests to amend their flight routes 
into Russian airspace. A spokesperson for Austrian Airlines said that one flight was canceled on Thursday, but it 
was unclear whether permission would be granted to prevent future flights from being disrupted. 'It is not yet 
possible to say when a decision will be made for the next flight. Currently, only today's connection had to be 
canceled,' they said. 
 In a statement, Air France said that a flight from Paris to Moscow was canceled on Thursday for 'operational 
reasons linked to the bypassing of Belarusian airspace requiring a new authorization from the Russian authorities.' 
An Air France flight to Russia was also canceled on Wednesday. 
 Any prolonged disruption is likely to further dial up tensions between Moscow and the West and test the ability of 
the EU to remain united in the face of Russian pressure. 
 'This is classic Russia looking to drive wedges,' said Tim Morrison, who was previously a top advisor on Russia 
and Europe in former President Donald Trump's National Security Council. 
 Morrison said he saw it as no coincidence that airlines from Austria and France had been affected, describing them 
as the 'more pro-Russian' countries in Europe that may be more likely to break ranks. The leaders of both countries 
have pushed for improved relations between the EU and Russia. 
Russia Blocks 2 Airlines Over Belarus Spat
 Several European airlines including Lufthansa, Iberia, and KLM have announced that they will no longer fly over 
Belarusian airspace, but it is unclear whether they will also be impacted. Flight trackers show that a British Airways 
flight successfully flew from London to Moscow on Wednesday evening, bypassing Belarusian airspace, while 
Poland's LOT airline traveled without disruption[1] from Warsaw to Moscow on Thursday evening. At the time of 
publication, a KLM flight from Amsterdam was not reporting any expected delays to its upcoming flight to Moscow. 
 Maxim Pyadushkin, managing director of the Russian magazine Air Transport Observer, said he believed the 
disruption stemmed from the fact that airlines have to agree a new point of entry into Russian airspace if they are to 
avoid Belarus. 'I hope it is a technical issue that can be resolved very quickly,' he said. 'I don' t think that Russia has 
any reasons to dispute with the EU about Belarussian airspace.' 
 The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
 Belarus has long been a close but problematic ally of Russia. Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko is set to 
travel to Russia on Friday for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
 The EU announced Monday that it would prepare further economic sanctions over Belarus's unprecedented 
decision to ground a civilian flight in pursuit of a government critic. 
 Protasevich is a co-founder and was the editor in chief of the Nexta channel on the encrypted social networking 
app Telegram, which played a key role in coordinating anti-government protests last August in the wake of rigged 
Belarusian presidential elections. Belarusian security services labeled Protasevich a terrorist last year, and he could 
face the death penalty if convicted of terrorism charges.

 Germany says EU foreign ministers won't be satisifed with "small steps" as they put together plans for economic 
and sector-specific sanctions.EU foreign ministers are discussing a new round of economic and sector-specific 
sanctions for Belarus, during informal talks on Thursday in the Portuguese city of Lisbon. 
This comes just days after EU leaders agreed to impose serious aviation restrictions, in response to a forced 
landing of a passenger plane by Belarus authorities. 
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell decried"the hijacking of the plane and the detention of the two passengers" as 
"completely unacceptable," shortly ahead of the meeting. 
He tweeted he was looking forward to discussions. 
What might the new sanctions be? 
Borrell said that the EU foreign ministers would be discussing sanctions against specific people connected to the 
Belarusian regime. 
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that he expected to see significant sanctions. If Belarusian President 
Alexander Lukashenko does not make concessions, "one must assume that this will be just the beginning of a large 
and long spiral of sanctions," Maas said ahead of the meeting. 
He described Lukashenko's behavior as "so unacceptable" that the EU would not be satisfied with smaller 
sanctions steps. 
Instead, the goal is "that we want to impose sanctions on the economic structure and on financial transactions in 
Belarus quite significantly so that it also has an impact. 
As they headed into the meeting, Baltic state ministers from Estonia and Lithuania speculated about possible 
sectors that the EU could target with sanctions. 
Lithuania Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told reporters: "We could talk about [sanctions on] the oil 
production sector." 
Meanwhile, Estonian Foreign Minister Eva-Maria Liimets told reporters that she was hoping to discuss sanctions on 
"the companies which are close to the Belarusian regime." 
Sector-specific sanctions could 'really hurt' Belarus 
DW's Senior European Correspondent Bernd Riegert explained that despite the far-reaching sanctions on flights, 
these were "not the biggest measures" that the EU will take against Belarus. 
Belarus : EU ministers begin talks on fresh sanctions
He said that the "sectoral sanctions" being discussed on Thursday could "really hurt Belarus." He suggested the EU 
could target the country's wood or cement industry. 
He stressed that "the EU is not there yet," adding that "not all foreign ministers are sure this is the right path." 
What's the row with Belarus? 
On Sunday, authorities in Belarus forced a Ryanair plane to land in the capital, Minsk, citing a bomb threat. 
They scrambled a fighter jet to ensure that the passenger plane, which was flying from Athens in Greece to Vilnius 
in Lithuania, would land. 
Authorities arrested 26-year-old Raman Pratasevich, an exiled Belarusian dissident and bloggerin Belarus who was 
on board. He had left the country in 2019, shortly before pro-democracy protests swept the country that has been 
dubbed "Europe's last dictatorship." 
The EU said it "strongly condemns" the arrest and forced landing, adding that it endangered aviation safety. 
They requested EU carriers to refrain from flying over Belarusian airspace. 
EU leaders also decided to ban Belarusian carriers from flying over the bloc's airspace. 
What else is on the agenda? 
The EU's foreign ministers are also set to discuss its strategy in Africa. This comes days after Mali's interim 
president and prime minister resigned on Wednesday after they were arrested in an "attempted coup." 
 Several EU countries have troops in the country as part of efforts to shore up a deteriorating security situation in 
the Sahel region. 
They will also talk about what the EU council termed "unresolved conflicts in the Eastern neighborhood" — likely 
also to mean Ukraine, in addition to Belarus. 
In April, there was growing concern in Western Europe over the amassing of around 100,000 Russian troops along 
its border with Ukraine and in the Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. 
Ministers are also set to tackle tensions in the Indo-Pacific region. There has been increasing tension in the 
contested South China sea region between the US and China.

US regulators have approved Boeing’s fix for the electrical issue that grounded more than 100 in‑service 737 Max 
and paused deliveries of new aircraft, a move that should allow the airframer to inject renewed momentum into the 
programme.
But a resumption of shipments may not come soon enough for Ryanair, which has voiced doubts about the 
manufacturer’s ability to meet deadlines.
Boeing shipped just four 737 Max during April, far lower than required as the manufacturer attempts to push 
inventory stockpiled out of the door.
Its attempts to return the Max programme to an even keel were scuppered in early April, when the electrical 
problem was revealed. However, on 12 May Boeing said that it had issued service bulletins relating to the fault and 
that repairs should begin shortly after gaining final approvals from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
The issue was related to the “potential degradation of bonds associated with electrical grounding of equipment that 
could affect the operation of certain systems”, says the FAA. Affected Max systems include standby power control 
units, “P6” circuit breaker panels and main instrument panels.
Boeing paused deliveries of new 737 Max aircraft after it also advised airlines to pull the aircraft from service. The 
problem affected 106 examples of the 737 Max 8 and Max 9, predominantly with US carriers. Affected jets have line 
numbers between 7,399 and 8,082. Boeing built them after making design changes in “early 2019”, the FAA says.
But in a sign that the programme has yet to fully recover, major customer Ryanair says it is beginning to doubt that 
its first 737 Max 8-200s will arrive before this summer’s peak travel months.
Group chief executive Michael O’Leary said on 17 May that even though Boeing was now suggesting its first Max 
aircraft will be delivered in late May, “I’m not sure we necessarily believe that”. Instead, he says: “There is a real risk 
now that we will not see any of these aircraft in advance of summer 2021”.
No Headline In Original
Ryanair had already downgraded its Max delivery outlook in late March, when it said it expected to take 16 aircraft 
in time for Europe’s busiest travel months, down from the maximum of 24 that it had previously hoped to receive.
In early April, the FAA and its European counterpart had certificated the high-density 737 Max 8-200 variant that 
Ryanair is the launch customer for, appearing to give the green light for deliveries to begin.
Since then, O’Leary claims that “the management in Seattle have constantly missed promised deadlines for the first 
delivery”, leaving the airline “quite upset”.
Although Ryanair may be sceptical of promised delivery dates, it retains a firm belief in the aircraft itself. Describing 
it as a “game-changer” for its cost base, the low-cost carrier notes that the Max 8-200 variant boasts four more 
seats and lower fuel burn than older-generation 737s.
The group’s carriers “are all very keen to get their hands on these new, efficient aircraft”, chief financial officer Neil 
Sorahan says. Ryanair has orders in place for 210 737-8-200 Max jets, having firmed up 75 more units in early 
December 2020.
While Boeing’s backlog for the type inched higher by three units in April – taking in 20 orders which were offset by 
17 cancellations – the Max received a fillip in early May when long-time customer Alaska Airlines announced it 
would exercise 13 options for the Max 9 variant, with deliveries in 2023 and 2024.

US regulators have approved Boeing’s fix for the electrical issue that grounded more than 100 in‑service 737 Max 
and paused deliveries of new aircraft, a move that should allow the airframer to inject renewed momentum into the 
programme.
But a resumption of shipments may not come soon enough for Ryanair, which has voiced doubts about the 
manufacturer’s ability to meet deadlines.
Boeing shipped just four 737 Max during April, far lower than required as the manufacturer attempts to push 
inventory stockpiled out of the door.
Its attempts to return the Max programme to an even keel were scuppered in early April, when the electrical 
problem was revealed. However, on 12 May Boeing said that it had issued service bulletins relating to the fault and 
that repairs should begin shortly after gaining final approvals from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
The issue was related to the “potential degradation of bonds associated with electrical grounding of equipment that 
could affect the operation of certain systems”, says the FAA. Affected Max systems include standby power control 
units, “P6” circuit breaker panels and main instrument panels.
Boeing paused deliveries of new 737 Max aircraft after it also advised airlines to pull the aircraft from service. The 
problem affected 106 examples of the 737 Max 8 and Max 9, predominantly with US carriers. Affected jets have line 
numbers between 7,399 and 8,082. Boeing built them after making design changes in “early 2019”, the FAA says.
But in a sign that the programme has yet to fully recover, major customer Ryanair says it is beginning to doubt that 
its first 737 Max 8-200s will arrive before this summer’s peak travel months.
Group chief executive Michael O’Leary said on 17 May that even though Boeing was now suggesting its first Max 
aircraft will be delivered in late May, “I’m not sure we necessarily believe that”. Instead, he says: “There is a real risk 
now that we will not see any of these aircraft in advance of summer 2021”.

Ryanair had already downgraded its Max delivery outlook in late March, when it said it expected to take 16 aircraft 
in time for Europe’s busiest travel months, down from the maximum of 24 that it had previously hoped to receive.
In early April, the FAA and its European counterpart had certificated the high-density 737 Max 8-200 variant that 
Ryanair is the launch customer for, appearing to give the green light for deliveries to begin.
Since then, O’Leary claims that “the management in Seattle have constantly missed promised deadlines for the first 
delivery”, leaving the airline “quite upset”.
Although Ryanair may be sceptical of promised delivery dates, it retains a firm belief in the aircraft itself. Describing 
it as a “game-changer” for its cost base, the low-cost carrier notes that the Max 8-200 variant boasts four more 
seats and lower fuel burn than older-generation 737s.
The group’s carriers “are all very keen to get their hands on these new, efficient aircraft”, chief financial officer Neil 
Sorahan says. Ryanair has orders in place for 210 737-8-200 Max jets, having firmed up 75 more units in early 
December 2020.
While Boeing’s backlog for the type inched higher by three units in April – taking in 20 orders which were offset by 
17 cancellations – the Max received a fillip in early May when long-time customer Alaska Airlines announced it 
would exercise 13 options for the Max 9 variant, with deliveries in 2023 and 2024.

 The mother of detained Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich is begging the European Union and the United 
States to help free her son. 
Natalia Protasevich and her husband, Dzmitry Protasevich, spoke about their son at a press conference at the 
Belarusian House Foundation in Warsaw, Poland, on Thursday, according to Radio Poland.[1] 
While asking for help from the EU and US, they also said their son has been tortured while in custody. 
Roman Protasevich, one of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's most vocal critics, was detained on May 
23 after being removed from a Ryanair flight and accused of terrorism and inciting anti-government riots[2].

 Belarus diverted a Ryanair flight on Sunday, and arrested an outspoken dissident who was on board. Belarus 
claimed it received a bomb threat via email from Hamas and informed the pilots. But the email was sent 24 minutes 
after Belarus alerted pilots of the supposed threat, per The Daily Beast[1]. See more stories on Insider's business 
page[2]. 
The supposed bomb threat that Belarus used to justify diverting a plane to arrest a journalist[3] was sent 24 minutes 
after Minsk first alerted the pilots, The Daily Beast reported[4]. 
On Sunday, Ryanair Flight 4978 from Athens, Greece, to Vilnius, Lithuania, was forced to land in Minsk. When it 
landed, Belarusian authorities boarded the plane and arrested the dissident Roman Protasevich[5], who was on 
board. 
Protasevich is one of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's most vocal critics and is accused of terrorism 
and inciting anti-government riots[6].  
Belarus said Monday that it had diverted the plane due to a bomb threat from the Hamas militant group[7].  
The Daily Beast reported Wednesday that the bomb threat, which came as an email, was received by Minsk 
National Airport's general information account at 12:57 p.m. on Sunday. 
But the plane was first alerted to the threat at 12:33 p.m., the outlet said, 24 minutes before. 
According to The Daily Beast, the email - which bore the subject line "Allahu Akbar" (Arabic for "God is great") - 
said: 
"We, Hamas soldiers demand that Israel cease fire in the Gaza Strip. We demand that the European Union 
abandon its support for Israel in this war. We know that the participants of Delphi Economic Forum are returning 
home on May 23 via flight FR4978. A bomb has been planted onto this aircraft. If you don't meet our demands the 
bomb will explode on May 23 over Vilnius." 
The Daily Beast noted that a further inconsistency exists as a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas had already 
been agreed two days before[8] the email was sent. 
Hamas has denied[9] involvement in the Ryanair interception. 
The bomb threat that Belarus cited to divert the Ryanair plane was sent 24 minutes after the pilots were first 
told it existed, report says
On Monday, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO, told Ireland's "Newstalk Breakfast"[10] radio show that the incident 
was "a case of state-sponsored hijacking" in which "the intent of the authorities was to remove a journalist." 
The hijacking has been widely denounced by top officials in the US[11], UK[12], and the EU[13]. Only Russia is 
standing by Belarus, leading some experts to suggest that Moscow - on which Belarus heavily relies on for support 
- was either involved or supportive of the hijacking.[14] 
Russia denies involvement. 
Protasevich is still in custody and, on Monday, the Belarusian government released a video in which he confessed 
to planning protests[15] in Minsk. 
However, his father, Dzmitry Protasevich, told Sky News[16] the confession looked forced and that his nose 
appeared to be broken. Read the original article on Business Insider[17]

2021. European Union foreign ministers meet Thursday to discuss EU-Africa relations and Belarus. (AP

BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union nations sketched out plans for new sanctions Thursday against Belarus that 
will target economic sectors close to its authoritarian president, as they sought to strike back at him for the forced 
diversion of a passenger jet to arrest a dissident journalist.  
 EU foreign ministers meeting in Lisbon vowed to continue to ramp up the pressure on Belarusian President 
Alexander Lukashenko — whose disdain for democratic norms and human rights has made his country a pariah in 
the West.  
 The latest plans for sanctions, which could target the country's lucrative potassium industry among others, comes 
after Belarusian flight controllers instructed a Ryanair jetliner's crew to land in the capital of Minsk on Sunday, citing 
a bomb threat. No bomb was found, but 26-year-old journalist and activist Raman Pratasevich was pulled off the 
plane and detained. EU leaders have denounced the move as a state-sponsored hijacking, while Lukashenko has 
defended his actions and accused the West of trying to 'strangle' his country with sanctions.  
 The EU has already advised its airlines to avoid the ex-Soviet nation's airspace and barred Belarusian carriers 
from EU airports and airspace. The 27-nation bloc has previously slammed Belarusian authorities with sanctions 
over the August election that handed Lukashenko a sixth term and that opposition groups have rejected as rigged 
as well as his ensuing crackdown on protests.  
 If the next batch of sanctions does not ease the crackdown on the opposition and democratic values, German 
Foreign minister Heiko Maas said the EU 'will continue to look at what effects this has in Belarus, whether 
Lukashenko relents. If that isn't the case we have to assume that this will be just the beginning of a big and long 
spiral of sanctions.'  
 The EU has tried on and off to encourage democratic reforms in Belarus, bring it closer to the bloc — and distance 
it from its main backer, Russia — but has not had much success. Some say more sanctions will do little to alleviate 
the situation and will only push Belarus even closer to Russia, and reduce the influence of the EU and others. (Ad)

anxious pet owners could trigger the biggest surge one sector has ever witnessed. 
EU eyes Belarus sanctions targeting sectors close to leader
 Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg acknowledged that it is a difficult balance. 
 'What we don't want to do is to drive the country in the arms of Russia,' he said.  
 Luxembourg Jean Asselborn said the bloc was focused on the country's large potassium industry. The mineral is 
mainly used in the fertilizing industry.  
 'The key word, I think, is potassium," he said. "Belarus produces a great deal of potassium, is one of the world's 
biggest suppliers. And I think it would hurt Lukashenko a great deal if we accomplished something there.'  
 The giant Belaruskali plant, controlled by the state as are most economic assets in the country of 9.3 million, is the 
main cash earner for Lukashenko's government along with petrochemicals.  
 The EU foreign ministers will prepare proposals for the sanctions but will not make final decisions on Thursday. 
 Lukashenko has defended the move to tell the Ryanair flight to land in his country, maintaining his contention that 
there was a bomb threat against it. He called it an 'absolute lie' that a fighter jet he scrambled forced the plane to 
land, saying it was merely.  
 He also insisted that Belarusian authorities had a legitimate right to arrest Pratasevich, who has become a top foe 
of Lukashenko, saying that the journalist was working to foment a 'bloody rebellion." Pratasevich's Russian 
girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, was also arrested. 
 Pratasevich, who left Belarus in 2019, ran a popular messaging app that had a key role in helping organize huge 
protests in recent months that have put Lukashenko under unprecedented pressure at home in the wake of the 
August vote. But the strongman has only increased his crackdown, and more than 35,000 people have been 
arrested since the protests began, with thousands beaten.

LISBON, Portugal (AP) — European Union nations sketched out plans Thursday for new sanctions against Belarus, 
targeting economic sectors close to its authoritarian leader, as they sought to strike back at him for the diversion of 
a passenger jet to arrest a dissident journalist.  
 Meeting in Lisbon, EU foreign ministers vowed to continue ramping up pressure on Belarusian President Alexander 
Lukashenko — whose disdain for democratic norms and human rights has made his country a pariah in the West.  
 The country's isolation has only deepened since Sunday, when Belarusian flight controllers told the crew of a 
Ryanair jet about a bomb threat and instructed it to land in Minsk, where journalist Raman Pratasevich was pulled 
off the plane. 
 A list of EU sanctions in place against senior members of the Belarus government, including Lukashenko, 'isn't 
having the dissuasive effect we need,' said Portuguese Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva. 
 Amid the testy standoff, Belarus did get some help from its ally Russia, which refused to allow two Moscow-bound 
jetliners to change their flight paths in order to avoid Belarus' airspace. 
 As the EU works to hold Lukashenko to account, Pratasevich's parents appealed at a news conference in Poland 
for help from the international community to free their 26-year-old son. 
 'I want you to hear my cry, the cry of my soul. So that you understand how difficult it is for us now and how much 
we are experiencing this situation,' said his mother, Natalia Pratasevich. "I am begging you, help me free my son.'  
 The EU ministers said they kept the family in mind as they did their work.  
 'I'm thinking of this young blogger, this young journalist, his mother and his father," Luxembourg Foreign Minister 
Jean Asselborn said in the Portuguese capital. "These are bandit tricks that are being carried out here. That can't 
be tolerated by the European Union.' (Ad) One company recently had a MASSIVE cannabis breakthrough. 
Something which could leave many of the big names in cannabis behind. 
 The latest plans for sanctions, which could target the country's lucrative potash industry among others, comes after 
the dramatic diversion of the Ryanair flight. EU leaders have denounced the move as a state-sponsored hijacking, 
while Lukashenko defended his actions and accused the West of trying to 'strangle' his country with sanctions. 
EU weighs Belarus sanctions at sectors close to leader
 EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc would not ease up on Belarus. 'We need to move more swiftly 
on sanctions,' he said after the informal Lisbon gathering, which drew up guidance for EU leaders but was not 
meant to take concrete action. 
 The EU has already advised its airlines to avoid the ex-Soviet nation's airspace and barred Belarusian carriers 
from EU airports and airspace. 
 But in a sign of support for Belarus, Russian authorities refused to allow two EU-based carriers to change their 
routes to Moscow so they could skirt Belarusian airspace. An Austrian Airlines flight from Vienna and an Air France 
flight from Paris both had to be canceled, the companies said. It was unclear what would happen to Friday's 
schedule.  
 The French pilots' union SNPL said in a statement it was "more than surprised' at the move. 
 'While normally the responses to this type of request for modification are accepted immediately, it's been radio 
silence for two days' from the Russian authorities, it said. 
 The 27-nation bloc previously slammed Belarusian authorities with sanctions over the August election, which gave 
Lukashenko a sixth term and that opposition groups have rejected as rigged, along with his ensuing crackdown on 
protests.  
 If the next batch of sanctions does not ease the crackdown on the opposition and democratic values, German 
Foreign minister Heiko Maas said the EU 'will continue to look at what effects this has in Belarus, whether 
Lukashenko relents. If that isn't the case, we have to assume that this will be just the beginning of a big and long 
spiral of sanctions.' 
 Foreign ministers from the G-7 group of leading industrialized nations — which includes some EU countries — also 
promised to take action. They said in a statement: 'We will enhance our efforts, including through further sanctions 
as appropriate, to promote accountability for the actions of the Belarusian authorities.' 
 The EU has tried on and off to encourage democratic reforms in Belarus — bring it closer to the bloc and distance 
it from Russia — but has not had much success. Some say more sanctions will do little to alleviate the situation and 
will only push it closer to Russia, reducing the influence of the EU and others. 
 Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg acknowledged it is a difficult balance. 
 'What we don't want to do is to drive the country in the arms of Russia,' he said.  
 Asselborn said the bloc was focused on the country's large potash industry, a major supplier for fertilizer, "and I 
think it would hurt Lukashenko a great deal if we accomplished something there.' 
 The giant Belaruskali plant, which is controlled by the state as are most economic assets in the country of 9.3 
million, is the main cash earner for Lukashenko's government, along with petrochemicals.  
 Later in the day, the International Civil Aviation Organization was planning a closed-door meeting at its 
headquarters in Montreal to discuss Sunday's flight diversion. Western leaders have asked the organization to 
investigate. 
 Lukashenko on Wednesday defended the move, maintaining a bomb threat was made against the flight. He also 
insisted Belarusian authorities had a legitimate right to arrest Pratasevich, who has become one of his top foes, 
saying that the journalist was trying to foment a 'bloody rebellion." Pratasevich's Russian girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, 
who also was on the flight, was arrested as well. 
 Pratasevich, who left Belarus in 2019, ran a popular messaging app that had a key role in helping organize huge 
demonstrations against Lukashenko after the August election. But he has only increased his crackdown, and more 
than 35,000 people have been arrested since the protests began, with thousands reported beaten.

7 Internet of Things Stocks That Are a Perfect Fit to Our Connected Future[2] When you say the Internet of Things 
(IoT) you may get different responses. I like to think of it broadly as being about connection. It's about devices that 
can connect with each other, and with the internet. And this provides users with the solutions that are making our 
lives more convenient. 
 The most basic, and ubiquitous, example of an IoT device is the smartphone that many of us have with us at all 
times. But think about what that has led to. Home assistants, security cameras, fitness apps, and so much more are 
all enabled by the internet of things. 
EU weighs Belarus sanctions at sectors close to leader
 IoT took on even more importance in the pandemic as businesses had to find a way to ensure the security and 
viability of their networks even as their employees were scattered remotely. This created demand for edge and 
cloud computing solutions that are also facilitated by the internet of things. 
 And yes, this is just the start. The need for more and more data is powering demand for IoT solution in areas such 
as autonomous vehicles. 
 But the good news is that this is an area that is still very much in its growth phase. And that means there is no lack 
of companies that you can find to trade in this sector. To help you get started, we've put together this special 
presentation that highlights seven such companies and the reasons why we believe they merit adding to your 
portfolio.

 By EU vs Disinfo[1] 
The pro-Kremlin ecosystem has established its talking points on Lukashenka's act of, in the words of the CEO of 
Ryanair, 'state-sponsored piracy[2]'. All the Kremlin-controlled media outlets repeat the same two mantras: 
'Everybody does it[3]!' and 'Pratasevich is a Bad Guy[4]'. 
The first claim is not only entirely irrelevant, but also factually wrong. Lukashenka is the only leader of state, albeit 
in this case illegitimate, that has ordered fighter jets to force a civilian aircraft to land in order to detain a political 
opponent. The second claim - on dissident Raman Pratasevich being an 'Extremist' - is both unfounded and 
irrelevant to the case. It doesnotjustify Lukashenka's decision to use military threat against a civilian aircraft. 
Moscow-based Strategic Culture Foundation does, while attempting to defend Lukashenka, actually support the 
notion that the illegitimate president acted illegally[5]: 
Admittedly, what took place in Belarusian airspace was irregular and possibly illegal. 
Still, the outlet attempts to put the blame on European leaders, 'refusing to hand over Pratasevich and thus,forcing 
Lukashenka to[6]make the controversial move'. And generally,Everybody does it![7] 
Other outletsattempt to defame Mr Pratasevich[8]himself. This is, again, entirely irrelevant to the case of 
Lukashenka's military threats towards a civilian aircraft. The claims follow a line of describing any form of dissent 
asFascism or Nazism[9]. 
Deny, Deceive, Defame And Deflect
And of course, we have the traditional 'deny everything' line of defence. Threatening civilian aircraft with fighter jets 
is'in strict alignment with international regulation[10]s'. No, it is not. Issuing a false bomb threat against a civilian 
airline is not the standard procedure for apprehending a wanted criminal. This is just a plain lie. 
A couple of words have to be said about the Belarusian authorities' claim thatthe terrorist organisation Hamas 
forwarded the bomb threat[11]against the Ryanair flight. This is actuallyMike and Nick level amateurism[12]from the 
Lukashenka regime. Belarusian transport authorities claimed Hamas forwarded a demand that the EU put pressure 
on Israel for a ceasefire in Gaza. Why Hamas would contact Minsk about this, and why they would demand a 
ceasefire several days after their victory parades in Gaza, remains a mystery. Senior Hamas leadershave denied 
the claims[13]; putting Minsk in the awkward situation of being perceived less trustworthy than an internationally 
condemned terrorist organisation. 
There seems to be a general rule for pro-Kremlin media contributors: 'When in doubt - blame Ukraine'. The Kremlin 
itself did not hurry in issuing comments on the Ryanair FR4879 incident, leaving the writers without guidance on 
lines to take. One outlet could not wait for Moscow's instructions and simply did what had to be done: blamed 
everything on Ukraine.The detention was a set-up by the Ukrainian Security Services![14] 
When it comes to numbers, disinformation on Ukraine dominates this week: just under 20 cases are devoted to 
various attempts to attack Ukraine: several follow very old tropes, 'Ukraine is a Nazi state[15]', 'Ukraine is 
undemocratic[16]',Ukraine is aggressive and under US control[17]', 'Ukraine is not a sovereign state[18]' All well-
worn, comfortable cases of disinformation. Currently there are4,400 cases on Ukraine[19]in the database. That is 
almost a third of the total number of cases collected since 2015. 
We see a conscious approach played out by the Kremlin:occupy the information space[20]. The method has been 
carefully presented inRussian security studies[21]' journals: 
A preventively shaped narrative, answering to the national interests of the state, can significantly diminish the 
impact of foreign forces' activities in the information sphere, as they, as a rule, attempt to occupy 'voids' [in the 
information flow]. 
Whataboutism[22]andbullshitting[23]- the pro-Kremlin media is shaping the narratives and avoiding the core issues.

 The Austrian Airlines flight wanted to change its route to avoid Belarus, but Russia rejected this, the airline said. 
Meanwhile, Belarusian national airline Belavia canceled flights to eight countries.Austrian Airlines said it canceled a 
cargo-passenger flight from Vienna to Moscow on Thursday.  
Flight OS601 from Vienna was scheduled to arrive in Moscow on time, but the board at Domodedovo airport listed 
the flight as canceled. Earlier, the airline had refused to transit through Belarusian airspace on the way to Moscow. 
The European Union has urged its airlines to avoid Belarus and its airspace following Sunday's forced landing in 
Minsk of a Ryanair plane and the arrest of dissident journalist Roman Pratasevich.  
A representative of Austrian Airlines told the Interfax news agency that the new flight route needed to be confirmed 
with the authorities. 
"The Russian authorities have not given us this permission," the spokeswoman was quoted as saying in the 
Russian-language report. 
"The Russian reaction is absolutely incomprehensible to us," Austria's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on the 
matter, calling it a disproportionate response.  
"The Austrian Foreign Ministry communicated this to the Russian ambassador today. The Austrian ambassador in 
Moscow also presented this position to Russia," it said, calling on Moscow to clarify its position and adding that all 
flights over and to Russia should be able to continue without problems. 
Earlier, AirFrance also reported canceled flights to the Russian capital.  
EU foreign ministers mull sanctions 
Also on Thursday, EU foreign ministers in Lisbon vowed to continue to increase pressure on Belarusian President 
Alexander Lukashenko. Foreign ministers of the Group of Seven called for the "immediate and unconditional 
release" of Pratasevich.  
"We demand the immediate and unconditional release" of Pratasevich, "as well as all other journalists and political 
prisoners held in Belarus," the ministers said in a joint statement published by the British government. 
The parents of detained journalist Pratasevich also urged the international community to help free their son. 
"I want you to hear my cry, the cry of my soul. So that you understand how difficult it is for us now and how much 
we are experiencing this situation,'' Natalia Pratasevich, the reporter's mother, said at a news conference in Poland. 
"I am begging you, help me free my son.'' 
Russia prohibits Austrian Airlines flight to arrive without entering Belarusian airspace: reports
Kremlin is 'not in charge of controlling air traffic' 
Meanwhile, Press Secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov sidestepped the question of canceling flights 
by European air carriers.  
"The presidential administration is not in charge of controlling air traffic. We recommend you to address this 
question to our aviation authorities," Peskov told journalists, Interfax quoted him as saying. 
Belavia cancels international flights 
Belarusian national carrier Belavia meanwhile cancelled flights to eight countries on Thursday. Belavia announced 
the cancellations "due to flight bans from a number of countries," after neighboring Poland joined a growing list of 
territories that have barred its overflights.  
"We regret that our passengers have to face this situation for reasons beyond the airline's control," Belavia said as 
it scrapped flights to Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Brussels, Frankfurt, Hanover, Kaliningrad, Milan, Munich, 
Rome, Vienna and Warsaw until Oct. 30. 
This is a breaking news story and will be updated as events unfold.

Belarus : EU ministers begin talks on fresh sanctions

 Germany says EU foreign ministers won't be satisifed with "small steps" as they put together plans for economic 
and sector-specific sanctions.EU foreign ministers are discussing a new round of economic and sector-specific 
sanctions for Belarus, during informal talks on Thursday in the Portuguese city of Lisbon. 
This comes just days after EU leaders agreed to impose serious aviation restrictions, in response to a forced 
landing of a passenger plane by Belarus authorities. 
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell decried"the hijacking of the plane and the detention of the two passengers" as 
"completely unacceptable," shortly ahead of the meeting. 
He tweeted he was looking forward to discussions. 
What might the new sanctions be? 
Borrell said that the EU foreign ministers would be discussing sanctions against specific people connected to the 
Belarusian regime. 
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that he expected to see significant sanctions. If Belarusian President 
Alexander Lukashenko does not make concessions, "one must assume that this will be just the beginning of a large 
and long spiral of sanctions," Maas said ahead of the meeting. 
He described Lukashenko's behavior as "so unacceptable" that the EU would not be satisfied with smaller 
sanctions steps. 
Instead, the goal is "that we want to impose sanctions on the economic structure and on financial transactions in 
Belarus quite significantly so that it also has an impact. 
As they headed into the meeting, Baltic state ministers from Estonia and Lithuania speculated about possible 
sectors that the EU could target with sanctions. 
Lithuania Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told reporters: "We could talk about [sanctions on] the oil 
production sector." 
Meanwhile, Estonian Foreign Minister Eva-Maria Liimets told reporters that she was hoping to discuss sanctions on 
"the companies which are close to the Belarusian regime." 
Sector-specific sanctions could 'really hurt' Belarus 
DW's Senior European Correspondent Bernd Riegert explained that despite the far-reaching sanctions on flights, 
these were "not the biggest measures" that the EU will take against Belarus. 
Belarus : EU ministers begin talks on fresh sanctions
He said that the "sectoral sanctions" being discussed on Thursday could "really hurt Belarus." He suggested the EU 
could target the country's wood or cement industry. 
He stressed that "the EU is not there yet," adding that "not all foreign ministers are sure this is the right path." 
What's the row with Belarus? 
On Sunday, authorities in Belarus forced a Ryanair plane to land in the capital, Minsk, citing a bomb threat. 
They scrambled a fighter jet to ensure that the passenger plane, which was flying from Athens in Greece to Vilnius 
in Lithuania, would land. 
Authorities arrested 26-year-old Raman Pratasevich, an exiled Belarusian dissident and bloggerin Belarus who was 
on board. He had left the country in 2019, shortly before pro-democracy protests swept the country that has been 
dubbed "Europe's last dictatorship." 
The EU said it "strongly condemns" the arrest and forced landing, adding that it endangered aviation safety. 
They requested EU carriers to refrain from flying over Belarusian airspace. 
EU leaders also decided to ban Belarusian carriers from flying over the bloc's airspace. 
What else is on the agenda? 
The EU's foreign ministers are also set to discuss its strategy in Africa. This comes days after Mali's interim 
president and prime minister resigned on Wednesday after they were arrested in an "attempted coup." 
 Several EU countries have troops in the country as part of efforts to shore up a deteriorating security situation in 
the Sahel region. 
They will also talk about what the EU council termed "unresolved conflicts in the Eastern neighborhood" — likely 
also to mean Ukraine, in addition to Belarus. 
In April, there was growing concern in Western Europe over the amassing of around 100,000 Russian troops along 
its border with Ukraine and in the Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. 
Ministers are also set to tackle tensions in the Indo-Pacific region. There has been increasing tension in the 
contested South China sea region between the US and China.

Defiant Belarus leader slams EU sanctions on plane diversion
Defiant Belarus leader slams EU sanctions on plane diversion

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Belarus’ authoritarian president lashed out Wednesday at Europe for trying to “strangle” his 
country with sanctions over the diversion of a passenger jet, and he accused a dissident journalist arrested after the 
flight landed in Minsk of working to foment a “bloody rebellion."
In a long, rambling speech to lawmakers and top officials, President Alexander Lukashenko defended his decision 
to tell the Ryanair flight to land in his country, maintaining his contention that there was a bomb threat against it. He 
called it an “absolute lie” that a fighter jet he scrambled forced the plane to land.
European Union leaders have denounced the move as an act of air piracy. Ryanair has said its crew was instructed 
to land. The plane was searched on the ground, and no bomb was found — but Raman Pratasevich, a 26-year-old 
journalist and activist, and his Russian girlfriend were detained.
“I acted in a lawful way, protecting people in line with international rules,” said the 66-year-old Lukashenko, who has 
ruled the ex-Soviet nation with an iron fist for more than a quarter century, relentlessly stifling dissent.
He fumed at the EU, accusing the West of waging what he said was “no longer just an information war but a 
modern hybrid war” against his country of 9.3 million.
Lukashenko doubled down on the idea that there was a grave security risk, saying the plane was not far away from 
the Astravets nuclear power plant and that he had ordered air defense systems to high alert.
“We acted in strict accordance with aviation safety rules,” he said, claiming the crew hesitated for about a quarter 
hour before following the Belarusian flight controllers' directions to land in Minsk. “It's the captain who makes a 
decision according to all instructions and rules, and we offered our help. The captain was thinking for 15 minutes 
and consulting the bosses and Vilnius airport staff.”
He said the crew hesitated for so long that Belarusian authorities no longer expected the crew to turn back to Minsk, 
since the plane was already near the Lithuanian border, but they did. The Belarusian MiG-29 was sent to help direct 
the Ryanair plane to land and facilitate communication in case of problems.
Defiant Belarus leader slams EU sanctions on plane diversion
“They should have been thankful to us!” Lukashenko exclaimed. “We did everything to save people.”
But he also alleged that Pratasevich and his associates were working with foreign spy agencies to “organize a 
massacre and a bloody rebellion in Belarus.”
He also warned his other foes abroad that the authorities will go after them.
“We know your faces, and it's just a matter of time for you to be brought to account before the Belarusian people,” 
he said.
Lukashenko has faced unprecedented pressure at home with months of protests following his reelection to a sixth 
term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition rejects as rigged. But he has only increased the crackdown, and 
more than 35,000 people have been arrested since the protests began, with thousands beaten.
Pratasevich, who left Belarus in 2019, has become a top foe of Lukashenko. He ran a popular messaging app that 
had a key role in helping organize the huge protests.
In Poland, Pratasevich's parents said they fear for his welfare and made an emotional plea for assistance.
“World, please stand up and help. I urge you very much because they will kill him, they will kill him!” Natalia 
Pratasevich said through tears in an interview in Warsaw.
Her son appeared in a video broadcast on Belarusian state TV on Monday in which he confessed to some of the 
charges against him.
Natalia Pratasevich said her son's nose appeared to broken and he seemed to be wearing makeup to cover facial 
bruises. The journalist’s father, Dmitry Pratasevich, said his son must have been forced to make the confession.
Ivan Tertel, head of the Belarusian state security agency that still goes under its Soviet-era acronym KGB, said 
Pratasevich told investigators about “the sponsors of subversive activities against Belarus, its mechanisms and 
special services and politicians behind it” and promised to release details soon.
Pratasevich, who fled to Lithuania in 2019, was charged in absentia with staging mass riots and fanning social 
hatred. Those carry a prison sentence of up to 15 years, and some fear he could face more serious charges, 
including some that carry the death penalty.
In response to Pratasevich's arrest and the diversion of the flight, which was traveling between two EU countries, 
European leaders agreed to ban Belarusian airlines from using the airspace and airports of the 27-nation bloc. They 
urged European airlines to avoid Belarus airspace. They agreed to draft more sanctions on officials linked to the 
diversion and ones targeting businesses provide income for Lukashenko’s government.
“Our ill-wishers outside and inside the country have changed their methods of attacking the state,” he said. “That's 
why they switched from organizing riots to trying to strangle us.”
He said Western sanctions are driven by "their envy, helplessness and anger that they have failed to carry out an 
armed rebellion and a coup in Belarus.”
Lukashenko said Belarus "is in the center of Europe, and if something flares up here, it could trigger another world 
war.”
“We will respond firmly to any sanctions, attacks and provocations. Not because we want to provoke a fight in the 
center of the continent. We don’t want it, we have had enough of it, but because you in the West are giving us no 
other choice,” he said.
He promised to retaliate by loosening border controls against Western-bound illegal migration and drug trafficking.
“We were stopping migrants and drugs — now you will catch them and eat them yourself,” he said.
Defiant Belarus leader slams EU sanctions on plane diversion
Prime Minister Roman Golovchenko said the country could halt Western cargo shipments via Belarus.
“Our measures would be quite painful for the countries that have taken an openly hostile stance — from import 
bans to restrictions on transit,” he said. “Still, we hope that those who rush to pass the point of no return to sober up 
and think twice before entering a slippery path of economic war in which there will be no winners.”
Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei also said Belarus could opt out of the EU's Eastern Partnership in view of the new 
sanctions. The program is part of EU efforts to help Belarus and other ex-Soviet nations distance themselves from 
Moscow's influence and integrate into the West.

The EU has decided to ban Belarusian airlines from European skies after a flight was diverted to Minsk on Sunday 
and a dissident journalist arrested.
At a meeting in Brussels, the leaders of the 27 member states also told EU airlines not to fly over Belarus, and 
promised further economic sanctions.
Roman Protasevich, 26, was on a flight from Greece to Lithuania which was rerouted over a supposed bomb threat.
Western countries accused Belarus of hijacking the Ryanair plane.
Belarus authorities on Monday released video of Mr Protasevich that appears to have been recorded under duress 
since his detention at Minsk airport.
In the clip, the journalist said he was in good health and seemingly confessed to crimes he had been charged with 
by the Belarusian state.
But activists, including the country's main opposition leader, criticised the video and suggested Mr Protasevich was 
under pressure to admit wrongdoing.
US President Joe Biden described the actions of the Belarusian authorities as "outrageous", saying they were 
"shameful assaults on both political dissent and the freedom of the press".
Mr Protasevich's father has told the BBC he fears his son may be tortured.
Dmitri Protasevich said on Monday he was "really afraid" of how his son would be treated by the authorities in his 
home country.
"We hope that he will cope. We are afraid to even think about it, but it's possible he could be beaten and tortured. 
We are really afraid of that," he said in a video call.
"We are really shocked and really upset," he said. "This sort of thing shouldn't be happening in the 21st Century at 
the heart of Europe.
EU agrees new Belarus sanctions after plane arrest
"We hope that the whole international community, including the European Union, will put unprecedented pressure 
on the authorities. We hope the pressure will work and the authorities will realise they've made a really big mistake."
Major European airlines have already begun rerouting flights away from Belarusian airspace.
The UK has suspended the operating permit for Belarusian state airline Belavia, and EU leaders have called on 
member states to take similar action.
In a separate development on Monday, Belarus expelled the Latvian ambassador and other diplomats after the 
Belarus national flag was replaced by a historical red-and-white flag used by the opposition at the Ice Hockey World 
Championships in the Latvian capital Riga.
Latvia responded by expelling Belarus diplomats.
How did events unfold on Sunday?
Belarus sent a fighter jet to force Ryanair flight FR4978 - which had departed from the Greek capital, Athens, and 
was bound for Vilnius in Lithuania - to land, claiming there was a bomb threat. It touched down in the capital Minsk 
at 13:16 local time (10:16 GMT) on Sunday.
Police then took Mr Protasevich away when the plane's 126 passengers disembarked. The activist, who witnesses 
said was "super scared", was arrested along with his girlfriend Sofia Sapega.
Ms Sapega's mother told the BBC that the 23-year-old had been taken to a Minsk jail, adding that the last word she 
managed to write on her WhatsApp messaging account was 'Mummy'. The accusations against her are unclear.
Belarus is the only European country that still executes prisoners, and witnesses said Mr Protasevich told fellow 
passengers he feared he would face the death penalty.
Three other passengers did not reach the plane's final destination in Vilnius. Ryanair chief executive Michael 
O'Leary said he believed some Belarusian KGB agents also departed the plane at Minsk, but this has not been 
independently verified.
Belarus said the flight had been diverted because of a bomb threat from the Palestinian militant group Hamas. A 
senior transport official read a letter to reporters that he claimed was from the militant group.
"If you do not fulfil our demands, the bomb will explode over Vilnius," it said.
But Hamas has denied any involvement. The group has no history or known capability of mounting operations 
outside Israel and the Palestinian territories. German leader Chancellor Angela Merkel said the Belarusian claim 
was "completely implausible".
The incident has drawn sharp condemnation from across the world, with countries urging the immediate release of 
Mr Protasevich and a full investigation.
Dozens of Belarusian officials, including President Alexander Lukashenko, are already under EU sanctions 
including travel bans and asset freezes, imposed in response to the repression on opponents.
State media in Belarus said Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled the country since 1994, personally gave the order for 
the plane to be diverted.
The 66-year-old leader has cracked down on dissenting voices since winning a disputed election last August. Many 
opposition figures have been arrested, while others fled into exile.
Who is Roman Protasevich?
EU agrees new Belarus sanctions after plane arrest
Mr Protasevich is a former editor of Nexta, a media operation with a Telegram channel. He left Belarus in 2019 to 
live in exile in Lithuania. From there he covered the events of the 2020 presidential election, after which he was 
charged with terrorism and inciting riots.
Nexta played a key role for the opposition during the vote, which was won by Mr Lukashenko and is widely 
regarded as rigged. It has continued to do so in its aftermath, particularly with the government imposing news 
blackouts.
Mr Protasevich now works for a different Telegram channel, Belamova. He stepped in to write for it after blogger 
Igor Losik was arrested by the Belarusian authorities in June last year. www.bbc.com/news/

Belarus ' Lukashenko defends decision on forced plane landing
Belarus' Lukashenko defends decision on forced plane landing

Belarus' long-time president, Alexander Lukashenko, on Wednesday defended his internationally slammed decision 
to force the landing of a passenger plane with a dissident journalist on board.
"I acted lawfully by protecting people - according to all international rules," Lukashenko told the parliament in Minsk.
Authorities used Sunday's landing to have dissident Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich arrested at the airport 
in Minsk.
Lukashenko initially said, without elaborating, that Belarus had received information that there was an explosive 
device on the plane.
Therefore, he said, the plane, which was on its way to Lithuania from Greece, was diverted to Minsk with the 
assistance of a fighter jet.
The European Union has launched new sanctions against the power apparatus in Belarus because of the action, 
including a landing ban for former Soviet republic's airlines and sanctions on leadership.
"That the plane was forced to land by a MiG-29 fighter jet is an absolute lie!" said Lukashenko. Belarus acted for 
safety reasons, he said, because the plane flew over the country's nuclear power plant.
More than 100 people were on board the Ryanair flight that was forced to land, including Protasevich and his 
partner, Sofia Sapega. Both were arrested. Their fate is uncertain.

 The United States and western European members of the UN Security Council called Wednesday for the 
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to investigate Belarus' diversion of a European flight and arrest of a 
dissident on board. 
Their call came hours after a defiant President Alexander Lukashenko on Wednesday defended the action, lashing 
out at critics at home and abroad.

26-year rule Photo: BELTA / Maxim GUCHEK  
The shockwaves from the affair multiplied Wednesday, as a Barcelona-bound flight from Minsk had to turn back 
after being refused access to French airspace, and as Poland closed its airspace to Belarusian carriers. 
In his first public statement since the Ryanair flight was diverted and opposition journalist and activist Roman 
Protasevich arrested on Sunday, Lukashenko dismissed the subsequent international outcry. 
"I acted lawfully to protect our people," Lukashenko said in an address to parliament.

The criticism was nothing more than another attempt by his opponents to undermine his rule, he said, accusing 
them of waging a "modern, hybrid war" against Belarus. 
"Our ill-wishers at home and abroad have changed their methods of attacking the state," Lukashenko said, 
accusing them of crossing "red lines" and "boundaries of common sense and human morality". 
 Lukashenko -- often dubbed "Europe's last dictator" -- is facing some of the strongest international pressure of his 
nearly 27 years ruling ex-Soviet Belarus.

But he continues to enjoy solid support from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is hosting the Belarusian leader 
on Friday. 
Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday there was no reason to disbelieve Lukashenko's version of 
events.

The Belarus strongman and his allies are under a series of Western sanctions over a brutal crackdown on mass 
protests that followed his disputed re-election to a sixth term last August.

The Belarusian opposition has called for stronger measures. 
The Athens-to-Vilnius flight was diverted over a supposed bomb scare, with Lukashenko scrambling a MiG-29 
fighter jet to accompany the aircraft.

Belarus has released a transcript of communications between Minsk air traffic control and the Ryanair flight, in 
which the crew was told "you have (a) bomb on board" and urged to land in Minsk. 
Lukashenko on Wednesday denied that the fighter jet had forced the airliner to land, calling such claims an 
"absolute lie". 
Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania had denied the Ryanair flight permission to land and its only option was to turn to 
Minsk, he said.

CHANNEL NEVOLF / -  
Once the plane landed, Protasevich -- the 26-year-old co-founder of opposition Telegram channel Nexta which 
coordinated last year's protests against Lukashenko -- and his Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega were arrested. 
He appeared in a video on Monday in which he confessed to helping to organise mass unrest, a charge that could 
land him in jail for 15 years. 
Sapega, a 23-year-old law student at the European Humanities University (EHU) in Lithuania, appeared in another 
video on Tuesday, saying she worked for a Telegram channel that disclosed information about Belarusian law 
enforcement. 
Her lawyer said she had been remanded in pre-trial detention for two months and Russia confirmed she was being 
detained as a criminal suspect. 
Belarus's opposition says such videos are routinely recorded by security forces, with participants forced to make 
statements under duress. 
Protasevich's mother told AFP in Poland that she had not slept since he was arrested. 
"I'm asking, I'm begging, I'm calling on the whole international community to save him," Natalia Protasevich said, 
weeping. 
"They're going to kill him in there." 
His father Dmitry Protasevich said that his son's lawyer was told that the journalist was not in his detention cell. 
"We think that he may be in hospital," he told AFP. "We believe his life and health could be in danger." 
EU leaders on Monday warned they would adopt further "targeted economic sanctions" against the Belarusian 
authorities to add to the 88 regime figures and seven companies on a blacklist. 
On Wednesday, a Minsk-to-Barcelona passenger flight by Belarusian state carrier Belavia was forced to turn back 
after being denied entry to French airspace, provoking an angry response from the authorities there. 
And Poland banned Belarusian flights using its airspace as part of the EU-wide sanctions agreed. 
Last year's months of protests against Lukashenko, which involved tens of thousands of people, were brutally 
quashed and thousands were detained. Several people died in the unrest, while many reported torture and abuse in 
custody. 
On Wednesday, dozens of people marched through the streets of Beryozovka east of Minsk for the funeral of Vitold 
Ashurok, 50, a well-known opposition activist who died Sunday from cardiac arrest in a penal colony in eastern 
Belarus. 
The call at the UN for the ICAO investigation echoes an earlier one from NATO. But Russia's support for Minsk 
means the UN Security Council is unlikely to agree a collective statement.

Belarus ' Lukashenko: Activist on plane forced to land was 'terrorist'
Belarus' Lukashenko: Activist on plane forced to land was 'terrorist'

Belarus' long-time president, Alexander Lukashenko, on Wednesday defended his internationally slammed decision 
to force the landing this weekend of a passenger plane with a dissident journalist on board.
"I acted lawfully by protecting people - according to all international rules," Lukashenko told the parliament in Minsk.
Authorities used Sunday's landing to have dissident Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich arrested at the airport 
in Minsk.
Protasevich is a "terrorist," added Lukashenko, who said the 26-year-old blogger was planning a "bloody uprising" 
in Belarus.
"There was a terrorist on board the plane," he said, claiming that it was his country's sovereign right to detain its 
own citizens.
Lukashenko initially said, without elaborating, that Belarus had received information that there was an explosive 
device on the plane.
Therefore, he said, the plane, which was on its way to Lithuania from Greece, was diverted to Minsk with the 
assistance of a fighter jet.
The European Union has launched new sanctions against the power apparatus in Belarus because of the action, 
including a landing ban for former Soviet republic's airlines and sanctions on leadership.
"That the plane was forced to land by a MiG-29 fighter jet is an absolute lie!" said Lukashenko. Belarus acted for 
safety reasons, he said, because the plane flew over the country's nuclear power plant.
Belarus ' Lukashenko: Activist on plane forced to land was 'terrorist'
More than 100 people were on board the Ryanair flight that was forced to land, including Protasevich and his 
partner, Sofia Sapega. Both were arrested. Their fate is uncertain.
Lukashenko made other claims about Protasevich's past, including that he had fought on the side of government 
forces in eastern Ukraine and had "a lot of experience as a mercenary."
Protasevich had reported from Ukraine in 2014, when the war between pro-Russian forces and the central 
government in Kiev was breaking out. However, it has never been proven that he engaged in combat.

Fears grow that detained Belarusian journalist subject to torture
Fears grow that detained Belarusian journalist subject to torture

Fears grew on Tuesday that the Belarusian dissident journalist Roman Protasevich, who was detained in Minsk 
after his plane was forcibly rerouted, has been subject to torture while in custody.
Natalia Protasevich, the mother of the journalist, said there was clear evidence that her son had been subject to 
violence, referring to footage released a day earlier from the Minsk pre-trial detention centre where he is being held.
He was arrested on Sunday after Belarusian authorities alerted the crew of his Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius 
of a possible security threat and directed it to land at an airport near Minsk.
President Alexander Lukashenko also ordered a MiG-29 fighter jet to be scrambled to accompany the plane, 
according to the state news agency.
Authorities in Minsk then detained Protasevich and his girlfriend, who was also on board.
"I am not a surgeon, but it is certain that they hit his nose and may have broken it," Protasevich's mother said of the 
video that was circulated by the authorities.
She also said her son's left cheek was swollen and sagging. "Even under the make-up, you can see a yellowish 
tinge - probably bruises were covered with powder."
She said she also saw signs of strangulation on the neck of her son. "From the looks of it, they choked him to beat 
evidence out of him."
In the video, Protasevich, 26, said he was being treated in accordance with the law and confessed to having 
organized riots.
Fears grow that detained Belarusian journalist subject to torture
Her son was forced to make the statement, Protasevich said. "He either read it off the page or was forced to 
memorize it."
Her son is a very strong person, said Protasevich, who lives with her husband in exile in Poland. However, she said 
she feared the authorities might abuse his girlfriend in order to break her son.
Her fears were echoed by opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who said the international community must 
act in concert to prevent a repeat of Belarus' actions at the weekend.
Now is the time to discuss joint steps "to bring the perpetrators to justice," Tikhanovskaya, who lives in exile in 
Lithuania, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.
The US should launch an investigation into the flight's forced landing and Protasevich's detention, she said after a 
phone call with US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.
"All of this is a result of the regime's impunity and the lack of a decisive response from the international community," 
she added.
On Tuesday, Russian newspaper RBK said Sofia Sapega, Protasevich's girlfriend, had been remanded in custody 
for two months, citing a lawyer.
In a video circulated by Belarusian state media, 23-year-old Sapega said she had also worked as an editor of an 
opposition Telegram channel and disseminated information about Belarusian security forces.
Belarusian blogger Stepan Putilo, the founder of the Nexta portal on Telegram along with Protasevich, told a Polish 
newspaper that he has been receiving death threats since Protasevich's arrest.
"They write to me that it's our turn next, that we won't be kidnapped to Belarus but shot in Warsaw," he told the 
Rzeczpospolita.
Nexta, the Belarusian opposition's main source of information during massive protests against long-time ruler 
Lukashenko, is based in Warsaw. Protasevich left Nexta at the end of 2020.
On Monday, the EU agreed to a package of sanctions, including the sealing-off of Belarusian airspace and a 
landing ban on its airlines in response to the forced landing of the plane.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed the sanctions.
"This is a state hijacking and demonstrates how the regime in Minsk attacks basic democratic rights and cracks 
down on freedom of expression and independent media," he said, adding that an urgent international investigation 
was needed.
Lufthansa, Air France and Finnair are the latest airlines to announce that they would be avoiding flying over Belarus 
for the time being.
Some 339 flights pass over Belarus per day to and from Europe, according to aviation authority Eurocontrol.
Belarus' state-owned airline said on Tuesday that it had suspended flights to London and Paris until the end of 
October in response to a landing ban by those countries, saying it regretted the situation.
Lukashenko was already under international pressure after disputed elections last year and a violent clampdown on 
widespread protests.

 A defiant President Alexander Lukashenko on Wednesday defended Belarus's diversion of a European flight and 
arrest of a dissident on board, lashing out at critics at home and abroad. 
In his first public statement since the Ryanair flight was diverted and opposition journalist Roman Protasevich 
arrested on Sunday, Lukashenko dismissed the international outcry the incident provoked. 
"I acted lawfully to protect our people," Lukashenko said in an address to parliament, the Belta state-run news 
agency reported.

26-year rule Photo: BELTA / Maxim GUCHEK  
The criticism was nothing more than another attempt by his opponents to undermine his rule, he said. 
"Our ill-wishers at home and abroad have changed their methods of attacking the state," Lukashenko said. 
"They have crossed many red lines and crossed boundaries of common sense and human morality." 
Lukashenko -- often dubbed "Europe's last dictator" -- is facing some of the strongest international pressure of his 
26-year rule of ex-Soviet Belarus.

 The strongman and his allies are already under a series of Western sanctions over a brutal crackdown on mass 
protests that followed his disputed re-election to a sixth term last August. 
European leaders are now accusing authorities in Minsk of essentially hijacking the passenger flight, and they 
agreed this week to cut air links with Belarus and told airliners to avoid the country's airspace.

The Belarusian opposition has called for further and stronger measures, and the UN Security Council was set to 
meet behind closed doors later on Wednesday. 
The Athens-to-Vilnius flight was diverted over a supposed bomb scare, with Lukashenko scrambling a MiG-29 
fighter jet to accompany the aircraft. 
Belarus has released a transcript of communications between Minsk air traffic control and the Ryanair flight, in 
which the crew was told "you have a bomb on board" and urged to land in Minsk. 
Lukashenko on Wednesday denied that the fighter jet had forced the airliner to land, calling such claims an 
"absolute lie".

Defiant Lukashenko Defends Plane Diversion, Blasts Critics
Protasevich -- the 26-year-old co-founder of opposition Telegram channel Nexta -- and his Russian girlfriend Sofia 
Sapega were arrested after the plane landed. 
Protasevich, who had been living between Poland and Lithuania, appeared in a video on Monday in which he 
confessed to helping to organise mass unrest, a charge that could land him in jail for 15 years. 
Sapega, a 23-year-old law student at the European Humanities University (EHU) in Lithuania, appeared in another 
video on Tuesday, saying she worked for a Telegram channel that disclosed information about Belarusian police. 
Her lawyer said she had been ordered held for two months of pre-trial detention and Russia confirmed she was 
being detained as a criminal suspect. 
Belarus's opposition says such videos are routinely recorded by security forces, with participants forced to make 
statements under duress. 
Protasevich's mother told AFP in Poland that she had not slept since he was arrested. 
"I'm asking, I'm begging, I'm calling on the whole international community to save him," Natalia Protasevich said, 
weeping. 
"They're going to kill him in there." 
EU leaders on Monday warned they would adopt further "targeted economic sanctions" against the Belarusian 
authorities to add to the 88 regime figures and seven companies on a blacklist. 
Last year's protests lasted for months, with tens of thousands taking to the streets to denounce Lukashenko, but 
were brutally quashed and thousands were detained -- many of whom reported torture and abuse in custody. 
Tikhanovskaya this week urged Europe and Washington to take stronger action against Lukashenko's regime, but 
he continues to enjoy solid support from Russia. 
Speaking to the European Parliament via video link on Wednesday, Tikhanovskaya called for a series of concrete 
measures, including a ban on new foreign investments and on Belarus's main exports like oil and metal products, 
potash fertilisers and wood. 
Diplomatic sources told AFP the UN Security Council would hold an informal meeting on Belarus on Wednesday 
but was unlikely to agree on a collective statement because of Russia's support for Minsk.

NATO condemned the action on Wednesday. The body's North Atlantic Council said the "unacceptable act 
seriously violated the norms governing civil aviation and endangered the lives of the passengers and crew."
Praotasevich and his partner, Sofia Sapega, should be released and there should be an "urgent independent 
investigation," the council said.
Belarus threatened to react to sanctions with ones of its own, though Prime Minister Roman Golovchenko said the 
decision would not be made hastily. "We suggest soberly thinking again before you go down the slippery slope of 
an economic war in which there will be no winners," he said, adding that the measures would be painful but leaving 
open whether they would apply to goods or oil and gas transport to Europe.
More than 100 people were on board the Ryanair flight that was forced to land, including Protasevich and his 
partner. Both were arrested. Their fate is uncertain.
Lukashenko made other claims about Protasevich's past, including that he had fought on the side of government

 A defiant President Lukashenko will address Belarus' parliament Wednesday as international pressure over the 
country's diversion of an airliner in order to arrest a dissident grows, with the UN Security Council set to meet 
behind closed doors later. 
The speech to parliament will be the first time the Belarusian leader has spoken in public since Sunday's rerouting 
of a Ryanair flight to Minsk and the subsequent arrest of opposition journalist Roman Protasevich.

After weathering a wave of protests and Western sanctions last year, Lukashenko is facing renewed pressure over 
the incident, with Western leaders demanding Protasevich's release, and the European Union cutting air links with 
the increasingly isolated nation. 
But a diplomat told AFP it was unlikely the Security Council would agree on a collective statement at Wednesday's 
meeting, because Belarus' unwavering supporter Russia was expected to be in opposition. 
Moscow has dismissed the outrage over the arrest, saying Belarus was acting reasonably and within the law when 
the plane was diverted.

The Belarusian transport ministry on Tuesday released a transcript of communications between Minsk air traffic 
control and the Ryanair flight, in which the crew was told "you have a bomb on board" and urged it to land in Minsk. 
The claim of a genuine bomb scare has been dismissed by Western leaders.

"I'm asking, I'm begging, I'm calling on the whole international community to save him," Natalia Protasevich said, 
weeping. "They're going to kill him in there!" 
Protasevich, 26, was a co-founder of the Nexta Telegram channel, which helped organise the protests last year that 
were the biggest challenge to Lukashenko's long rule.

"The lawyer tried to see him today but she was turned down, she could not see him. We still don't know if he is in 
there, what his condition is, how he is feeling," said his father Dmitry. 
A 30-second video of Protasevich was broadcast by state television late Monday, in which he confirmed that he was 
in prison in Minsk and "confessed" to charges of organising mass unrest. 
With dark markings visible on his forehead, he said he was being treated "according to the law".

But Dmitry told AFP it appeared that his son had been harmed. 
"He would never speak like that. Those were not his words... he was reading something out that he was told to read 
out," he said. 
Opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya urged the international community to do more in a call with US National 
Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. 
"This is the time to act," she said. "Suspension of flights over Belarus doesn't solve the real problem. The problem 
is the terrorist regime that rigged elections last year." 
US President Joe Biden, who is scheduled to meet with Putin in June, said Washington was looking at "appropriate 
options to hold accountable those responsible". 
French President Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday the EU must "profoundly redefine" its relationship with Russia 
and Belarus because "we are at the limits of sanctions policy", whilst German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas warned 
that Lukashenko would pay "a bitter price" for the "heinous" flight diversion. 
The UN rights office and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined calls for Protasevich to be released, and 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would "strongly support action through all available international 
institutions", including NATO. 
The European Union has agreed to ban Belarusian airlines from the bloc and called on EU-based carriers not to fly 
over its airspace. 
Air France, Finnair and Singapore Airlines were the latest carriers to suspend flights over Belarus, following 
Scandinavian airline SAS, Germany's Lufthansa and Latvia-based regional airline airBaltic. 
Lukashenko and his allies are already under a series of Western sanctions over the brutal crackdown on the 
protests that followed his disputed re-election to a sixth term last August. 
EU leaders on Monday warned they would adopt further "targeted economic sanctions" against the Belarusian 
authorities to add to the 88 regime figures and seven companies on a blacklist. 
The protests lasted for months with tens of thousands taking to the streets to denounce Lukashenko, who has ruled 
Belarus with an iron fist for over two decades. 
The demonstrations were brutally quashed and thousands were detained -- many of whom reported torture and 
abuse in custody. 
Many protest leaders -- including Tikhanovskaya who claimed victory in the August vote -- fled the country, and the 
demonstrations have dwindled. 
"An ordinary Belarusian will not suffer from this. Ordinary Belarusians cannot afford flights," said Valentina, a retired 
teacher who like others was afraid to give her last name.

LAUREN FEDOR AND KATRINA MANSON WASHINGTON
Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden will hold a summit meeting on June 16 in Geneva, Switzerland, in an effort to repair 
strained relations between the countries.
In their first face-to-face meeting as presidents, the US and Russian leaders will "discuss the state and prospects 
for the further development of Russian- American relations, and strategic stability issues", the Kremlin said.
The White House said Biden and Putin would "discuss the full range of pressing issues, as we seek to restore 
predictability and stability to the USRussia relationship".
The meeting was announced as Russia dismissed as "obsessive Russophobia" the notion that it was involved in 
Sunday's plot to force a Ryanair flight to land in Belarus.
Belarusian authorities used a false bomb threat and a fighter jet to force the plane to land in Minsk, where dissident 
journalist Roman Protasevich was arrested, sparking international condemnation. Dominic Raab, UK foreign 
secretary, said it was "very difficult to believe that this kind of action could have been taken without at least the 
acquiescence of the authorities in Moscow".
Putin and Biden plan Geneva summit in June; Bilateral HENRY FOY - MOSCOW
The Geneva summit comes during a deterioration in relations between Moscow and Washington amid sanctions, tit-
for-tat diplomatic expulsions and US allegations of Russian meddling in elections.
The Russian ambassador to Washington was recalled in March in response to Biden telling an interviewer that he 
agreed with the assessment that Putin was a "killer". A month later the US ambassador to Moscow also returned 
home for talks.
Biden proposed a summit in a third country during a call with Putin last month, in what the US president said would 
be an effort to "normalise" relations between the countries.
Two days later he imposed new sanctions against Moscow, citing alleged Russian actions including US election 
influence operations, a cyber-hacking campaign and the maltreatment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.
The Biden administration has said it is seeking neither to reset the relationship nor increase tensions, but instead to 
put "guardrails" on it.
Some analysts in Washington said the meeting would in effect hand Putin a public relations coup. But the White 
House said it was seeking to develop areas for co-operation, including nuclear issues, climate change, Afghanistan, 
Iran, Syria and North Korea.
Moscow said the leaders would discuss "topical issues on the international agenda, including interaction in the fight 
against the coronavirus pandemic and the settlement of regional conflicts".
Russia denies claims of involvement in attempts to meddle in US elections as well as the SolarWinds cyber attack.

Your hard-hitting editorial ("Lukashenko's air piracy must be punished", FT View, May 25) stated that "even by the 
thuggish if capricious standards of Belarus dictator Alexander Lukashenko, the forced diversion of a Ryanair flight in 
order to arrest one of its passengers is an outrage".
Your news team also reported a comment from Jen Psaki, US president Joe Biden's press secretary, calling it a 
brazen affront to international peace and security by the regime in Belarus.
However, the event also recalls the press coverage of the forced landing in Vienna of a plane carrying the then 
Bolivian president Evo Morales in July 2013, when en route from Russia. The plane was forced to land amid US 
suspicions that whistleblower Edward Snowden may have been aboard.
The same Psaki, at the time spokesperson for the US state department, acknowledged that the US had been "in 
contact with a range of countries across the world who had any chance of having Snowden land or even transit 
through their countries".
The FT reported that Dilma Rousseff, then president of Brazil, said the blocking of Morales' flight was a violation of 
international law and civilised norms between nations, and demanded "an immediate explanation" and apologies 
from the countries involved in forcing it to divert to Austria, including France and Spain.
Lukashenko is certainly wrong to take the action he did with the Ryanair flight, and his dictatorial regime should be 
condemned and punished by the international community for this and the other acts of repression in Belarus.
Obama's action against Morales was air piracy too Letters
But Psaki should perhaps acknowledge that she is a hypocrite, and Biden's leadership in foreign affairs might begin 
by renouncing past acts of over-reach by his predecessors, including those by former president Barack Obama.

Russia has dismissed as "obsessive Russophobia" the notion that it was in- volved in the plot to force a Ryanair 
flight to land in Belarus in order to detain an opposition activist.
Belarusian authorities on Sunday used a false bomb threat and a MiG-29 fighter jet to force the plane to land in 
Minsk, where dissident journalist Roman Protasevich was detained by police.
Responding to the operation to arrest Protasevich, Dominic Raab, UK foreign secretary, said it was "very difficult to 
believe that this kind of action could have been taken without at least the acquiescence of the authorities in 
Moscow", adding that he had "no clear details" on the involvement of Russia, Belarus's neighbour and closest ally.
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said yesterday that the EU had not ascertained "any firm findings" of a link 
between the Belarusian actions and Moscow but that she would raise the issue the next time she spoke to Vladimir 
Putin, Russia's president.
"When I talk to the Russian president, this issue will certainly be on the agenda," she said. "But we cannot now 
indulge in speculation. That there is a close relationship between Belarus and Russia, that is known. But as I said, 
no confirmed findings."
Russia and Belarus have a deeply integrated air defence system, are military allies and their security services have 
a number of co-operation agreements.
Kremlin rejects collusion claim as Russophobia; Airline plot HENRY FOY - MOSCOW
The Kremlin dismissed Raab's allegations. "This is obsessive Russophobia, this is an obsession with blaming 
Russia for absolutely everything," said Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman. "It is unfortunate that such politically 
inappropriate accusations occur."
Peskov added that EU and UK sanctions imposed on Belarus were too hasty, given that a full investigation into the 
incident had not yet taken place.
"There is probably no point in trying to explain anything, here phobia and obsession begin to take their toll and the 
authors of these statements are not given the opportunity to soberly assess the situation," he said.
Earlier, Russia's foreign ministry defended Minsk's actions and accused its critics of hypocrisy, citing examples of 
planes being diverted by western nations to arrest wanted people.
Russian state media has also defended Minsk. Margarita Simonyan, head of state-funded television network RT, 
said Lukashenko had "pulled it off beautifully".
Moscow yesterday also denied reports that four Russian nationals had left the plane in Minsk and not carried on to

Russia has dismissed as "obsessive Russophobia" the notion that it was in- volved in the plot to force a Ryanair 
flight to land in Belarus in order to detain an opposition activist.
Belarusian authorities on Sunday used a false bomb threat and a MiG-29 fighter jet to force the plane to land in 
Minsk, where dissident journalist Roman Protasevich was detained by police.
Responding to the operation to arrest Protasevich, Dominic Raab, UK foreign secretary, said it was "very difficult to 
believe that this kind of action could have been taken without at least the acquiescence of the authorities in 
Moscow", adding that he had "no clear details" on the involvement of Russia, Belarus's neighbour and closest ally.
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said yesterday that the EU had not ascertained "any firm findings" of a link 
between the Belarusian actions and Moscow but that she would raise the issue the next time she spoke to Vladimir 
Putin, Russia's president.
"When I talk to the Russian president, this issue will certainly be on the agenda," she said. "But we cannot now 
indulge in speculation. That there is a close relationship between Belarus and Russia, that is known. But as I said, 
no confirmed findings."
Russia and Belarus have a deeply integrated air defence system, are military allies and their security services have 
a number of co-operation agreements.

The Kremlin dismissed Raab's allegations. "This is obsessive Russophobia, this is an obsession with blaming 
Russia for absolutely everything," said Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman. "It is unfortunate that such politically 
inappropriate accusations occur."
Peskov added that EU and UK sanctions imposed on Belarus were too hasty, given that a full investigation into the 
incident had not yet taken place.
"There is probably no point in trying to explain anything, here phobia and obsession begin to take their toll and the 
authors of these statements are not given the opportunity to soberly assess the situation," he said.
Earlier, Russia's foreign ministry defended Minsk's actions and accused its critics of hypocrisy, citing examples of 
planes being diverted by western nations to arrest wanted people.
Russian state media has also defended Minsk. Margarita Simonyan, head of state-funded television network RT, 
said Lukashenko had "pulled it off beautifully".
Moscow yesterday also denied reports that four Russian nationals had left the plane in Minsk and not carried on to 
its intended destination of Vilnius.

girlfriend Sofia Sapega, remained in Minsk, and that the others who disembarked were from Greece and Belarus.

Brussels should prohibit EU dealings with two dozen state-owned Belarusian companies, block key exports from 
Minsk and ban foreign investment into the country, according to a list of measures prepared by the Belarus 
opposition to lobby the bloc.
In response to Belarus's interception of a Ryanair flight to arrest dissident Roman Protasevich, EU sanctions should 
specifically target the country's oil, petrochemicals, potash fertilisers, metals and wood industries, which together 
account for about half its merchandise exports, according to a document seen by the Financial Times.
The EU is Belarus's second main trade partner, representing almost a fifth of the country's business in goods. Last 
year it exported about (EURO)4bn of goods to the EU and imported slightly more than (EURO)6bn, according to EU 
data. Russia is Belarus's largest trade partner, with an almost 50 per cent share.
The EU's analysis of potential measures has only just begun. There would be debate over how to strike a balance 
between hurting the regime while minimising harm to ordinary Belarusian citizens, EU diplomats said.
The opposition wants the bloc to prohibit EU companies from dealing with state-owned companies including the 
largest potash producer, Belaruskali, fertiliser group Grodno Azot, and its main oil group Belneftekhim, several 
refiners and six banks. The document proposes a moratorium on foreign investment in Belarus and on new credit 
lines for its banks. About (EURO)400m from the EU was invested in Belarus in 2019.
Exports block urged as part of sanctions; EU measures
The final decision on EU sanctions will rest with member states. Some, notably Germany, are reluctant to pass 
serious sanctions on entire economic sectors over concerns about their effectiveness and durability against legal 
challenges.
France has raised the prospect of inviting Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Belarus's exiled opposition leader, to next 
month's G7 summit if the British, who are hosting the event, agree.
Belarus's state-owned industries are a crucial source of hard currency for Lukashenko's regime. Belneftekhim made 
$4.2bn from export revenues from January to the end of November last year, while Belaruskali, which accounts for 
about 20 per cent of the global potash market, sold $2.4bn abroad last year.
Some businesses have already come under pressure after the US resumed sanctions on nine companies in April, 
including Belneftekhim and Naftan, the country's largest oil refinery.
"It would be good if the EU took these companies as a starting point because these companies don't really trade so 
much with the US, so the impact of the US sanctions is still quite limited," said Katia Glod at the Center for 
European Policy Analysis, a think-tank.

Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden will hold a summit on June 16 in Geneva, in an effort to repair strained relations 
between their two countries.
In their first face-to-face meeting as presidents, the US and Russian leaders will "discuss the state and prospects 
for the further development of Russian- American relations, and strategic stability issues", the Kremlin said.
The White House said Biden and Putin would "discuss the full range of pressing issues, as we seek to restore 
predictability and stability to the USRussia relationship".
The meeting was announced as Russia dismissed as "obsessive Russo- phobia" the notion that it was involved in 
Sunday's plot to force a Ryanair flight to land in Belarus.
Belarusian authorities used a false bomb threat and a fighter jet to force the plane to land in Minsk, where dissident 
journalist Roman Protasevich was arr- ested, sparking global condemnation.
Dominic Raab, UK foreign secretary, said it was "very difficult to believe that this kind of action could have been 
taken without at least the acquiescence of the authorities in Moscow".

at low ebb Moscow rails at 'Russophobia'
The Geneva summit comes after a deterioration in bilateral relations between Moscow and Washington amid 
sanctions, tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions and US allegations of Russian meddling in elections.
The Russian ambassador to Washington was recalled in March in response to Biden's telling an interviewer he 
agreed with the assessment that Putin was a "killer". A month later the US envoy to Moscow also returned home for 
talks.
Biden proposed a summit in a third country during a call with Putin last month, in what the US president said would 
be an effort to "normalise" relations between the countries.
Two days later he imposed new sanctions against Moscow, citing alleged Russian actions including US election 
influence operations, a cyber hacking campaign and the maltreatment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.
The Biden administration has said it is seeking neither to reset the relationship nor escalate tensions but instead to 
put "guard rails" on it. Some analysts in
Washington said a high-profile meeting between the leaders would hand Putin a public relations coup. But US 
officials said the White House was seeking to develop areas for co-operation, including nuclear issues, climate, 
Afghanistan, Iran, Syria and North Korea.
The Kremlin said the leaders would discuss "topical issues ... including interaction in the fight against the 
coronavirus pandemic and the settlement of regional conflicts". Russia has denied allegations of meddling in US 
elections as well as the SolarWinds cyber attack.
The summit was announced the day after a meeting in Geneva between Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security 
adviser, and Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the Russian Security Council. Belarus reports & Global Insight page 3

The Biden administration has said it is seeking neither to reset the relationship nor escalate tensions but instead to 
put "guard rails" on it. Some analysts in
Washington said a high-profile meeting between the leaders would hand Putin a public relations coup. But US 
officials said the White House was seeking to develop areas for co-operation, including nuclear issues, climate, 
Afghanistan, Iran, Syria and North Korea.
The Kremlin said the leaders would discuss "topical issues ... including interaction in the fight against the 
coronavirus pandemic and the settlement of regional conflicts". Russia has denied allegations of meddling in US 
elections as well as the SolarWinds cyber attack.
The summit was announced the day after a meeting in Geneva between Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security 
adviser, and Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the Russian Security Council. Belarus reports & Global Insight page 3

Roman Protasevich's involvement in the anti-Lukashenko movement began years before the mass protests last 
summer triggered by the Belarusian president's decision to cling to power after contested elections.
Franak Viacorka, an aide to Belarus's exiled opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, first came across the 26-
year-old activist in 2011. Protasevich was just one fresh-faced teenager taking part in anti-regime demonstrations.
In the following years, Protasevich rose to become a prominent opposition voice on platforms including Radio Free 
Europe and as editor of Nexta, one of Belarus's main independent media groups, a path that led to his capture last 
weekend after the Ryanair flight he was on was diverted.
"Many Belarusian activists realised 10 years ago that activism was not enough to win, and that in journalism you 
can do much more. At the same time, journalism cannot win alone. And this hybrid type of media activist appeared 
and Roman was one of them," said Viacorka.
"He is impulsive. He is creative. He cannot accept injustice."
Now Protasevich finds himself at the centre of a global diplomatic dispute pitting Belarus against the EU, the UK 
and the US, after the Vilnius-bound plane he boarded in Athens on Sunday was diverted over Belarusian airspace 
at the order of Lukashenko. The activist was arrested as soon as the plane landed in Minsk.

"Looks like the [Belarus's KGB] were following me in the airport," he told his friends via a messaging app before 
boarding. "In any case - suspicious shit."
The interception, which has drawn international condemnation and marks a worsening in relations between the 
Belarusian regime and the west, has underscored the lengths to which Lukashenko is prepared to go to silence his 
critics as he seeks to reassert control following widespread protests last year.
Protasevich, who left Belarus in 2019 and lives in Vilnius, was put on Belarus's terror watchlist in November and 
was charged with three protest-related crimes, the most serious of which carries a sentence of up to 15 years in jail.
Belarus's security services have been ordered to track down the main protagonists of anti-regime protests "in any 
way", according to Dzianis Melyantsou, an expert at the Minsk Dialogue Council on International Relations.
"The goal is pretty obvious: to show that going forward, if you value your life you can't do anything of the sort in 
Belarus ever again," he said.
It was at Nexta that Protasevich's twin roles as activist and journalist reached their widest audience. As Lukashenko 
intensified his crackdown on the protests that erupted against him last summer, Nexta's channels, among the few to 
dodge an internet blackout, became a key source of information about what was actually happening. Nexta's 
Telegram channels have more than 1.2m subscribers, in a country of 9.4m.
"My son was always someone who had a strong reaction against lies. That's why he became a journalist," Roman's 
father, Dmitry Protasevich, pointed out.
"The whole problem is that the authorities are scared of even the tiniest freedom of speech, criticism, or 
independent media that tell the truth."
Nexta did not just report on the protests. It helped co-ordinate them, providing protesters with everything from 
information about where to gather, what to wear and how to evade security forces. As editor in chief, Protasevich 
was at the heart of these activities, Nexta's founder, Stsiapan Putsila, said. "Now the regime is taking revenge," 
Putsila added.
In recent months, Belarusian authorities have stepped up repression against journalists from independent 
publications with readership beyond the urban middle class that makes up the core of the protests. Last week, 
Belarus blocked Tut.by, the most popular independent news site, and charged 15 staff with tax evasion. Several 
local papers were banned from publishing print versions and thus reaching Belarus's working class, Lukashenko's 
historical support base.
Protasevich probably became an even greater target after he quit Nexta last September to try to reach these rural 
Belarusians, Igor Trushkevich, a dissident living in exile in Ukraine, explained.
Protasevich has since been in charge of Belamova, another opposition news channel on the Telegram messaging 
app, with approximately 260,000 subscribers. Lukashenko's regime made it clear it was targeting dissidents abroad 
in April when Russia's FSB, the successor to the Soviet KGB, arrested two opposition figures in Moscow and 
handed them over to Belarus.
A senior Belarusian official then vowed to "find and purge" dissidents abroad.
"We remind our out-of-control, bloodthirsty opposition that we know them all," deputy interior minister Nikolai 
Karpenkov said.
"We know where they are, who they talk to, where their home is, and where their families are. Let them know that 
vengeance is inevitable," he added.

The arrest of Protasevich has sent a jolt of anxiety through Belarus's opposition in exile, not least because 
Tsikhanouskaya and some of her team had taken the same aerial route from Athens back to their base in the 
Lithuanian capital Vilnius a week earlier.
"It's shocking, it's devastating, it changes a lot ... It mobilises the international community but I am afraid that 
tomorrow the international community will forget," Viacorka commented.
"If the Europeans don't want North Korea in the centre of Europe, if they don't want aeroplanes with passengers to 
be shot down, they should react . . . . "It's no longer a matter of Belarusian domestic policy, it is an issue of 
European security now."

Western powers call for probe into Belarus plane diversion

May 26, 2021( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 The United States and western European members of the UN Security Council called Wednesday for the 
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to investigate Belarus' diversion of a European flight and arrest of a 
dissident on board. 
 Their call came hours after a defiant President Alexander Lukashenko on Wednesday defended the action, lashing 
out at critics at home and abroad. 
 The shockwaves from the affair multiplied Wednesday, as a Barcelona-bound flight from Minsk had to turn back 
after being refused access to French airspace, and as Poland closed its airspace to Belarusian carriers. 
 In his first public statement since the Ryanair flight was diverted and opposition journalist and activist Roman 
Protasevich arrested on Sunday, Lukashenko dismissed the subsequent international outcry. 
 'I acted lawfully to protect our people,' Lukashenko said in an address to parliament. 
 The criticism was nothing more than another attempt by his opponents to undermine his rule, he said, accusing 
them of waging a 'modern, hybrid war' against Belarus. 
 'Our ill-wishers at home and abroad have changed their methods of attacking the state,' Lukashenko said, accusing 
them of crossing 'red lines' and 'boundaries of common sense and human morality'. 
 Lukashenko — often dubbed 'Europe's last dictator' — is facing some of the strongestinternational pressure of his 
nearly 27 years ruling ex-Soviet Belarus. 
 But he continues to enjoy solid support from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is hosting the Belarusian leader 
on Friday. 
 Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday there was no reason to disbelieve Lukashenko's version of 
events. 
 The Belarus strongman and his allies are under a series of Western sanctions over a brutal crackdown on mass 
protests that followed his disputed re-election to a sixth term last August. 
 European leaders, who accuse the authorities in Minsk of effectively hijacking the passenger flight, this week 
agreed to cut air links with Belarus and told airliners to avoid the country's airspace. 
- Video 'confessions' - 
Western powers call for probe into Belarus plane diversion
The Belarusian opposition has called for stronger measures. 
 The Athens-to-Vilnius flight was diverted over a supposed bomb scare, with Lukashenko scrambling a MiG-29 
fighter jet to accompany the aircraft. 
 Belarus has released a transcript of communications between Minsk air traffic control and the Ryanair flight, in 
which the crew was told 'you have (a) bomb on board' and urged to land in Minsk. 
 Lukashenko on Wednesday denied that the fighter jet had forced the airliner to land, calling such claims an 
'absolute lie'. 
 Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania had denied the Ryanair flight permission to land and its only option was to turn to 
Minsk, he said. 
 Once the plane landed, Protasevich — the 26-year-old co-founder of opposition Telegram channel Nexta which 
coordinated last year's protests against Lukashenko — and his Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega were arrested. 
 He appeared in a video on Monday in which he confessed to helping to organise mass unrest, a charge that could 
land him in jail for 15 years. 
 Sapega, a 23-year-old law student at the European Humanities University (EHU) in Lithuania, appeared in another 
video on Tuesday, saying she worked for a Telegram channel that disclosed information about Belarusian law 
enforcement. 
 Her lawyer said she had been remanded in pre-trial detention for two months and Russia confirmed she was being 
detained as a criminal suspect. 
 Belarus's opposition says such videos are routinely recorded by security forces, with participants forced to make 
statements under duress. 
- 'They're going to kill him' - 
Protasevich's mother told AFP in Poland that she had not slept since he was arrested. 
 'I'm asking, I'm begging, I'm calling on the whole international community to save him,' Natalia Protasevich said, 
weeping. 
 'They're going to kill him in there.' 
 His father Dmitry Protasevich said that his son's lawyer was told that the journalist was not in his detention cell. 
 'We think that he may be in hospital,' he told AFP. 'We believe his life and health could be in danger.' 
 EU leaders on Monday warned they would adopt further 'targeted economic sanctions' against the Belarusian 
authorities to add to the 88 regime figures and seven companies on a blacklist. 
 On Wednesday, a Minsk-to-Barcelona passenger flight by Belarusian state carrier Belavia was forced to turn back 
after being denied entry to French airspace, provoking an angry response from the authorities there. 
 And Poland banned Belarusian flights using its airspace as part of the EU-wide sanctions agreed. 
 Last year's months of protests against Lukashenko, which involved tens of thousands of people, were brutally 
quashed and thousands were detained. Several people died in the unrest, while many reported torture and abuse in 
custody. 
 On Wednesday, dozens of people marched through the streets of Beryozovka east of Minsk for the funeral of 
Vitold Ashurok, 50, a well-known opposition activist who died Sunday from cardiac arrest in a penal colony in 
eastern Belarus. 
 Opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya on Wednesday urged the European Parliament to ban both new foreign 
investments in Belarus and the country's main exports. 
 The call at the UN for the ICAO investigation echoes an earlier one from NATO. But Russia's support for Minsk 
means the UN Security Council is unlikely to agree a collective statement.

European leaders meeting in Brussels on Monday evening probably exceeded expectations with their riposte to the 
forced diversion of a Ryanair flight on the orders of Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko. Not only did they 
close European airports to Belarus's national airline and instruct their own carriers to avoid its airspace, they 
opened the way to targeted economic sanctions, a step they had so far been reluctant to take.
The EU has often appeared hesitant and weak when dealing with foreign autocrats, especially Russian president 
Vladimir Putin, who now holds Lukashenko on a tight leash. It imposed a travel ban and asset freezes on a handful 
of Russian officials responsible for crushing domestic political opposition. It did nothing in response to Russia's 
huge military build-up on Ukraine's borders earlier this year, or to recent evidence of Russian involvement in 
explosions at a Czech arms depot in 2014.
Lukashenko's act was a test the EU could not afford to fail. It was also an easy one to pass. "The low expectations 
speak volumes," said Rosa Balfour, director of Carnegie Europe, a think-tank.

A fortuitously timed summit brought EU leaders together for deliberations and compelled them to come up with a 
unified response. Belarus's blatant breach of international aviation law provided a sure legal footing for action, a 
constant preoccupation for the EU.
"I had no doubt the EU would have a strong reaction," said Kadri Liik of the European Council on Foreign Relations. 
"It was such a clearcut case. And there are tools to react."
The promise of tougher sanctions needs to be put into action and could get bogged down
Moreover, the interception of a European airliner carrying mostly EU passengers between two EU capitals was, as 
European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen put it, an attack on European sovereignty. It transcended 
the divisive question of how to affect the course of domestic affairs in non-democratic countries, for which the EU 
often lacks real leverage.
The promise of tougher EU sanctions still needs to be put into action and the process could easily become bogged 
down. The bloc needs to work out how to target officials, businesspeople, state entities and companies linked to the 
regime while minimising the impact on ordinary Belarusians. And the penalties have to be legally watertight.
Sanctions must also be approved unanimously by EU foreign affairs ministers. Cyprus last year blocked sanctions 
on Belarus for three months as it sought to push the EU to adopt a tougher line on Turkey. Hungary is also a 
potential obstacle. Its readiness to veto EU diplomatic statements - including condemnation of democratic 
backsliding in Hong Kong and an appeal for a ceasefire in the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas - has 
caused consternation in EU capitals.
So far, on the bigger decisions, Budapest has fallen into line. But, as historian Eva Balogh notes, most capitals 
wield the veto to protect their national interests, whereas Hungary seems to do it to serve the interests of other 
countries. The support of Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban cannot be taken for granted.
The bigger problem for EU foreign policy is Russia, where the bloc lacks a strategy for advancing its interests. The 
relationship is shaped by sanctions and the deadlocked peace talks over the war in eastern Ukraine. Both 
mechanisms are frozen.
French president Emmanuel Macron has failed to win over other countries to his idea for a new dialogue with the 
Kremlin. Poland, the Baltic states and Sweden see Russia as an existential threat while others see it is as a 
commercial and geopolitical opportunity.
Putin's meeting with US president Joe Biden in Geneva next month will be the moment to gauge the chances of a

 Belarus strongman Aleksandr Lukashenko, who diverted a passenger airplane carrying a journalist and 
government dissident on board this week, defended his actions Wednesday as necessary to quell a bomb threat, 
AP reports[1]. 
Why it matters: The incident, which EU leaders have called a "hijacking," has drawn international condemnation and 
further isolated Lukashenko, who is often referred to as "Europe's last dictator." 
Driving the news: EU nations have banned Belarusian airlines, told European airlines not to fly over the country, 
and promised more economic sanctions. Lukashenko described the retaliation as a 'hybrid war' to 'strangle' 
Belarus. 'Our ill-wishers outside and inside the country have changed their methods of attacking the state,' 
Lukashenko said Wednesday. 'That's why they switched from organizing riots to trying to strangle us.'#8216;I acted 
in a lawful way, protecting people in line with international rules,' Lukashenko claimed. Catch up quick: The plane 
was in Belarusian airspace headed to Lithuania when pilots were told to land in Minsk — and escorted there by a 
Belarusian fighter jet — because of 'a potential security threat on board," according a statement from Ryanair[2]. 
Journalist Raman Protasevich, a prominent opposition figure living in exile, reportedly told[3] other passengers he 
was facing the death penalty before he was arrested during the stop. No bomb was found on board.Lukashenko 
said it was an 'absolute lie' that the fighter jet forced the Ryanair plane to land.The CEO of Ryanair described the 
incident[4] as a "state-sponsored hijacking." Go deeper: Biden says U.S. to coordinate with EU on Belarus

 A defiant President Alexander Lukashenko on Wednesday defended Belarus's diversion of a European flight and 
arrest of a dissident on board, lashing out at critics at home and abroad. 
 In his first public statement since the Ryanair flight was diverted and opposition journalist Roman Protasevich 
arrested on Sunday, Lukashenko dismissed the international outcry the incident provoked. 
 'I acted lawfully to protect our people,' Lukashenko said in an address to parliament, the Belta state-run news 
agency reported. 
 The criticism was nothing more than another attempt by his opponents to undermine his rule, he said. 
 'Our ill-wishers at home and abroad have changed their methods of attacking the state,' Lukashenko said. 
 'They have crossed many red lines and crossed boundaries of common sense and human morality.' 
 Lukashenko — often dubbed 'Europe's last dictator' — is facing some of the strongestinternational pressure of his 
26-year rule of ex-Soviet Belarus. 
 The strongman and his allies are already under a series of Western sanctions over a brutal crackdown on mass 
protests that followed his disputed re-election to a sixth term last August. 
 European leaders are now accusing authorities in Minsk of essentially hijacking the passenger flight, and they 
agreed this week to cut air links with Belarus and told airliners to avoid the country's airspace. 
- Video 'confessions' - 
The Belarusian opposition has called for further and stronger measures, and the UN Security Council was set to 
meet behind closed doors later on Wednesday. 
 The Athens-to-Vilnius flight was diverted over a supposed bomb scare, with Lukashenko scrambling a MiG-29 
fighter jet to accompany the aircraft. 
 Belarus has released a transcript of communications between Minsk air traffic control and the Ryanair flight, in 
which the crew was told 'you have a bomb on board' and urged to land in Minsk. 
 Lukashenko on Wednesday denied that the fighter jet had forced the airliner to land, calling such claims an 
'absolute lie'. 
Defiant Lukashenko defends plane diversion, blasts critics
 Protasevich — the 26-year-old co-founder of opposition Telegram channel Nexta — and his Russian girlfriend 
Sofia Sapega were arrested after the plane landed. 
 Protasevich, who had been living between Poland and Lithuania, appeared in a video on Monday in which he 
confessed to helping to organise mass unrest, a charge that could land him in jail for 15 years. 
 Sapega, a 23-year-old law student at the European Humanities University (EHU) in Lithuania, appeared in another 
video on Tuesday, saying she worked for a Telegram channel that disclosed information about Belarusian police. 
 Her lawyer said she had been ordered held for two months of pre-trial detention and Russia confirmed she was 
being detained as a criminal suspect. 
 Belarus's opposition says such videos are routinely recorded by security forces, with participants forced to make 
statements under duress. 
- 'They're going to kill him' - 
Protasevich's mother told AFP in Poland that she had not slept since he was arrested. 
 'I'm asking, I'm begging, I'm calling on the whole international community to save him,' Natalia Protasevich said, 
weeping. 
 'They're going to kill him in there.' 
 EU leaders on Monday warned they would adopt further 'targeted economic sanctions' against the Belarusian 
authorities to add to the 88 regime figures and seven companies on a blacklist. 
 Last year's protests lasted for months, with tens of thousands taking to the streets to denounce Lukashenko, but 
were brutally quashed and thousands were detained — many of whom reported torture and abuse in custody. 
 Many protest leaders — including now-exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who claimed victory in the 
August vote — fled the country, and the demonstrations have dwindled. 
 Tikhanovskaya this week urged Europe and Washington to take stronger action against Lukashenko's regime, but 
he continues to enjoy solid support from Russia. 
 Speaking to the European Parliament via video link on Wednesday, Tikhanovskaya called for a series of concrete 
measures, including a ban on new foreign investments and on Belarus's main exports like oil and metal products, 
potash fertilisers and wood. 
 Diplomatic sources told AFP the UN Security Council would hold an informal meeting on Belarus on Wednesday 
but was unlikely to agree on a collective statement because of Russia's support for Minsk.

May 26, 2021( The Week UK: http://www.theweek.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  
 The Kremlin has accused the UK of harbouring an 'obsession' with Russia after Dominic Raab suggested 
thatMoscow must have approvedthe forced landingof a Ryanair plane by Belarus. 
A spokesperson for Vladimir Putin said the accusation was grounded in a 'Russophobic obsession, an obsession 
with blaming Russia for everything and everyone', adding: 'It will probably soon come to the point that Russia is 
accused of the very fact of its own existence.' 
Countries worldwide have condemned Belarus for 'hijacking'the Ryanair flight on Sunday in order to arrestone of 
the passengers, dissident journalist Roman Protasevich[1]. But Russia'sresponse has been 'muted', saysThe 
Moscow Times[2]- a reaction that analysts reportedly believe'speaks to the Kremlin's ambivalent view of Belarus's 
longtime strongman president Alexander Lukashenko, who is at once a beleaguered ally increasingly dependent on 
Moscow's goodwill, and a troublesome partner'. Air war Lukashenko hit back at critics of his regimeon Monday, 
after both the UK and the EU told airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace. 
In what The Times[3] describes as a 'rambling address' to the Belarusianparliament, the presidentaccused 'ill-
wishers from outside and inside the country' of changing 'their methods of attacking our state'. 
'They have crossed many red lines and crossed the boundaries of common sense and human morality. They have 
moved from organising riots to the stage of strangulation,' he told lawmakers. 
Belarus had no choice but to divert the planefollowing reports ofa bomb on board, said the president, whoclaimed 
that thewarning had come from within Switzerland. Belarusian officials had previously claimed that Hamas 
threatened to blow up the plane[4],an allegation that the Palestinian militant group denies. 
Lukashenko 'also appeared to suggest that Belarus would have been within its rights to shoot down the Ryanair 
plane because it was flying near a Belarusian nuclear power station', The Times reports. 
Underlining the alleged danger, he asked: 'What if the nuclear power station's safety systems were suddenly put on 
full alert?' 
Critics including the UK foreign secretary remain unconvinced byLukashenko's claims - and byRussia's show of 
outrage. 
Moscow has previously 'backed the Lukashenko regime[5] with loans and cheap energy resources', but has moved 
to 'distance itself from the hijacking', The Telegraph[6] reports. 
Russia 'wary' of defending ally Belarus amid plane hijack row
But Raab told the Commons on Monday that while Downing Street did not have 'any clear details at this stage'about 
possible Russian involvement, it was 'very difficult to believe that this kind of action could have been taken without 
the acquiescence of the authorities in Moscow'. Cooling relations 'A new wave of sanctions and restrictive 
measures on Belarus's aviation industry, severing its direct links with much of Europe, looks set to increase the 
country's reliance on Russia,'writes The Guardian[7]'s Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth. 
But despite the Kremlin's long-standing support for Lukashenko[8], who has been in power for 26 years, Moscow 
'appears wary' of backing him amid such widespread opposition, Roth adds. 
In the hours immediately after Belarus 'shocked the world' by forcing the plane to land in Minsk[9], Russian officials 
'maintained conspicuous radio silence on the events', says The Moscow Times. 
International security expert Mark Galeotti told The Guardian that the Kremlin was 'not going to go out of its way to 
critique what Belarus has done'. But 'conversely, it's not leaping in with full-throated support because it does not 
want to be caught in the fallout', he said. 
The EU yesterday issueda joint statement[10] sayingthat 'the European Council strongly condemns the forced 
landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk', with the blocthreatening'further targeted economic sanctions' against Belarus. 
As the Western powers mull their response, Galeotti argues that the key'question is going to be: is this it?' 
Along with 'the rest of us', Moscow is'waiting to see if the sanctions move into a new phase', he says.'If this is all 
they have to face then I reckon they will feel that they got away with it.' 
Meanwhile,Lukashenko is plotting his next move. Although he was elected on a 'pro-Russian, Soviet nostalgic 
ticket', the Belarusian leaderhas 'always prioritised his own freedom of manoeuvre over ties with Moscow', says The 
Moscow Times. 
'I believe that Lukashenko acted alone, without Russian involvement,'Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the R.Politik 
political consultancy, told the paper. 
'The Russian leadership is shocked by this but can't publicly show it as they have to protect their geopolitical 
interests,' she added.'They see now who they are dealing with. 
'In the Kremlin's eyes, Lukashenko has become a problem that needs to be addressed[11].'

 EU Sanctions Belarus For 'State Terrorism' - National Airline Now Banned From Europe's Airspace 
 EU Sanctions Belarus For 'State Terrorism' - National Airline Now Banned From Europe's Airspace[1] 
As we noted on Monday European countries, following the example of Lithuania and the UK, are now effectively 
imposing a ban on European carriers flying through Belarusian airspace after Sunday's Ryanair incident where the 
Ireland-based airliner was forcibly diverted from its flight path to land in Minsk, in order for Belarusian authorities to 
arrest anti-Lukashenko journalist Roman Protasevich.

On yesterday's threat Petri Krohn wrote of: LUKASHENKO'S REVENGE (Best served cold) Last summer Ukraine's 
security service SBU tried to play dirty trick on Lukashenko. Russian volunteers, who had fought on the 
Novorossiyan side in the Ukrainian civil war were made a fake job offer, 'security' work on Syrian oil fields.

 The Belarusian leader said "ill-wishers" are "trying to strangle Belarus" in his first speech since a commercial flight 
was intercepted and a critical blogger arrested.Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko hit out at Western powers 
on Wednesday, saying that his country's "ill-wishers" are "trying to strangle Belarus." 
It's the first time Lukashenko has spoken in public since a Ryanair plane was diverted over the weekend and 
dissident blogger Raman Pratasevich and law student Sofia Sapega were taken into custody. 
What did Lukashenko say? 
In his speech, Lukashenko said that "attacks" on Belarus have crossed "red lines." 
"As we predicted, our ill-wishers at home and abroad have changed their methods of attacking the state. They have 
crossed many red lines and crossed boundaries of common sense and human morality," Lukashenko said as he 
addressed members of parliament, the Belta state-run news agency reported. 
He also said that a bomb threat, which Belarusian authorities said was behind the plane's landing in Minsk, came 
from Switzerland, and that outside forces were waging a "hybrid war" against the country. 
Lukashenko additionally called it an "absolute lie" that a fighter jet forced the plane to land, and said Belarus had 
acted "lawfully, to protect people." 
"I acted lawfully to protect our people," he said, also accusing Pratasevich of planning to start a "bloody rebellion." 
What happened with the flight? 
On Sunday, Belarusian authorities forced a Ryanair plane to land as it was flying to Lithuanian capital, Vilnius. 
Upon landing in Minsk, authorities and took blogger Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, into 
custody. 
Prior to his arrest, Pratasevich — a vocal critic of Lukashenko — was traveling from Greece to Lithuania. 
Minsk ordered the commercial plane flying over its airspace to land, claiming a bomb was onboard — an 
explanation German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called "completely implausible." 
The EU responded by slapping sanctions on Belarus, including a ban on Belarusian airlines using EU airspace or 
airports. 
Following Lukashenko's comments on Wednesday, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said it was 
advising EU airlines, as well as non-EU carriers flying to or from the bloc, to avoid airspace above Belarus.  
"The circumstances surrounding this action cast serious doubts on the respect shown by Belarus for international 
civil aviation rules," the EASA said in a safety bulletin. 
Belarus : Lukashenko slams Western response to forced plane diversion
"The actions undertaken by Belarus amounted to an increased safety risk for the [Ryanair] flight and put into 
question the ability of Belarus to provide safe air navigation services." 
Opposition announces new protests 
Meanwhile, the Belarusian opposition it is preparing to stage a new phase of active anti-government protests in 
Belarus, exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said. 
Mass protests erupted against President Alexander Lukashenko last summer after he declared victory in a 
presidential election that his opponents said was rigged. The protests slowed down after a sweeping crackdown 
implemented by authorities.  
"There's nothing more to wait for, we have to stop the terror once and for all," Tsikhanouskaya said in a statement 
on social media.

 One of Sofia Sapega's biggest concerns might have been defending her thesis, then the flight she and her 
boyfriend, Raman Pratasevich, were on was forced to the ground in Belarus. Now she has many other worries.After 
a two-week vacation in Greece, 23-year-old Sofia Sapega was returning to her university studies in the Lithuanian 
capital, Vilnius, on Sunday. But plans to defend her master's thesis were put on hold after Belarus falsely claimed 
there was a bomb on her Ryanair flight, forced the plane to land in Minsk and took her into custody.  
She was traveling with her boyfriend, Raman Pratasevich, a Belarusian blogger and prominent critic of authoritarian 
leader Alexander Lukashenko. As soon as the plane was diverted to Minsk, Pratasevich realized he would be 
arrested and handed Sapega his laptop and phone, a passenger on the flight told Reuters news agency. But 
Belarusian authorities detained her, saying she will be held in pre-trial detention for two months. 
Russian news outlet Novaya Gazeta reported Sapega, a Russian citizen, could face charges of plotting riots and 
organizing an action that violates public order. The Russian Foreign Ministry has promised to offer her consular 
services.  
Sapega under 'psychological pressure' 
On Tuesday, Sapega appeared in a video, saying she was a publisher of a Telegram channel that illegally 
disclosed the private information of officers in the Belarusian Interior Ministry. 
Sapega is well and has not complained of inappropriate treatment, the RIA news agency reported, citing the 
Russian Embassy to Belarus. 
But the Belarusian opposition members said the recording, which shows Sapega talking fast and making little eye 
contact with the camera, was coerced and possibly made under duress. They also said Pratasevich's alleged 
confessional video, in which he has dark marks on his forehead, was forced. 
"Clearly, Raman is beaten in prison," exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya tweeted. "He and Sofia are 
under psychological pressure." 
Sapega's mother, Anna Dudich, said there was no reason for her daughter's arrest. 
"My hopes are now probably based on a miracle and on the knowledge that my daughter is definitely not guilty of 
anything," she told Reuters from Lida in Belarus. "She simply showed up in the wrong place at the wrong time." 
Dudich said she worries about her daughter's safety and health in Belarusian detention. The last time she heard 
from Sapega was in the form of a text when the plane was forced to land in Minsk. 
It only read "Mama." 
EU leaders call for immediate release 
Who is Sofia Sapega, girlfriend of Belarusian blogger Raman Pratasevich?
The arrest of Pratasevich and Sapega caused international outrage. EU leaders have called the plane diversion a 
"hijacking" and "state piracy" and are demanding the immediate release of the detained couple.  
On Monday, they announced additional economic sanctions on individuals involved in the flight diversion as well as 
businesses supporting Lukashenko's regime. The EU has progressively been restricting key political figures in 
Belarus since October 2020 as a response to the government crackdown on peaceful protesters. 
This time around, the 27-nation bloc also prohibited Belarusian airlines from flying in EU airspace or landing at EU 
airports. Some European carriers like Lufthansa and KLM have stopped flying to Belarus. 
"Lukashenko and his regime have to understand this will have severe consequences," European Commission 
President Ursula von der Leyen said.

 David Sassoli called for a strong EU response to Sunday's (23 May) forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk and 
the immediate release of those being held by Belarus, EU affairs[1]. 
The president of the European Parliament made the appeal at the start of the European Council on 24 May. In his 
speech to EU heads of state and government, he said: 'An international investigation is undoubtedly needed to 
verify whether air transport and passenger safety was jeopardised by a sovereign state and if there has been a 
violation of the Chicago Convention. 
'Our response must be strong, immediate and unified. The European Union must act without hesitation and punish 
those responsible. Tonight you have a great responsibility to show that the Union is not a paper tiger.' 
Regarding climate change measures, Sassoli warned that Parliament could not be expected to simply rubberstamp 
the conclusions of the European Council: 'As far as we are concerned, Parliament is working to reach an ambitious 
climate and energy package before summer, with a strengthened emissions exchange system and more ambitious 
targets on renewable energy and energy efficiency.' 
The president praised the recent agreement on the European Covid-19 certificate, which will make it easier for 
people to travel safely through Europe. 'For Parliament, the certificate cannot be a condition for free movement. We 
also clearly indicated that no one must be discriminated against due to health conditions or health choices and we 
want only necessary data to be included in the certificate.' 
Although the vaccination campaign in the EU is progressing swiftly, Sassoli stressed the importance of helping 
beyond the bloc's borders by exporting vaccines and providing doses to low and medium income countries. He also 
supported the mandatory sharing of licenses to help boost production in these countries.

Turning to migration, he said the EU has a legal and moral obligation to save lives and added that people should be 
able to arrive in the EU safely without having to risk their lives. He also called for a true European migration 
reception policy and referred to the resolution adopted by Parliament[2] on this last week.

 A Ryanair pilot who landed his plane in Belarus on Sunday (23 May) repeatedly questioned information about an 
alleged bomb threat, before ultimately agreeing to land in Minsk, according to a transcript released on Tuesday (25 
May) by authorities in Belarus, write Gabrielle Ttrault-farber and Andrew Osborn. 
Belarus scrambled a warplane to escort the flight, which was en route from Greece to Lithuania. When the plane 
landed in Minsk, Belarusian authorities arrested a dissident journalist. Western countries have described the 
incident as a hijacking or piracy. 
The transcript released on Tuesday differs from excerpts previously released by Belarus state TV, which had 
attributed some of the pilot's remarks to the controller. State TV had pointed to its version to argue that the pilot had 
asked to land in Minsk, rather than that the controller had advised him to do so. 
Following are excerpts from the transcript, which Reuters was unable to verify. For clarity, the call sign, RYR 1TZ, 
which both the pilot and controller repeated when they spoke, has been edited out. 
CONTROLLER INFORMS PILOT OF BOMB, SUGGESTS LANDING IN MINSK 
Controller: Minsk 
Pilot: Yes, go ahead. 
Controller: For your information, we have information from special services that you have bomb on board and it can 
be activated over Vilnius. 
Pilot: Standby. 
'They say code is red': transcript of controller telling plane to land in Minsk
Pilot: Ok, could you repeat the message? 
Controller: I say again, we have information from special services that you have bomb on board. That bomb can be 
activated over Vilnius. 
Pilot: Roger that, standby. 
Controller: For security reason we recommend you to land at UMMS. (ICAO code for Minsk airport) 
Pilot: Ok...that..it..understood give us alternate please. 
Pilot: The bomb....direct message, where did it come from? Where did you have information about it from? 
ATC: Standby please. 
Pilot: Go ahead. 
ATC: Airport security staff informed they received e-mail. 
Pilot: Roger, Vilnius airport security staff or from Greece? 
ATC: This e-mail was shared to several airports. 
Pilot: Roger, standby. 
PILOT ASKS FOR FURTHER DETAILS 
Pilot: Again, this recommendation to divert to Minsk where did it come from? Where did it come from? Company? 
Did it come from departure airport authorities or arrival airport authorities? 
Controller: This is our recommendations. 
Pilot: Can you say again? 
Controller: This is our recommendations. 
Pilot: (unreadable.) 
Pilot: Did you say that your recommendation? 
PILOT AGREES TO LAND IN MINSK 
Controller: Advise your decision please. 
Pilot: I need answer the question: what is the code of the (unreadable) green, yellow or amber, red. 
Controller: Standby. 
Controller: They say code is red. 
Pilot: Roger that, in that case we request holding at present position.

May 26, 2021( Deutsche Welle World: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/world/s-1429 Delivered by Newstex)  
 The arrest of of Belarussian blogger Raman Pratasevich sparked a global outcry. How did a rebellious student turn 
into a public enemy that Belarus was so keen to get their hands on, they sent a fighter jet after him?In his Twitter 
profile, Raman Pratasevich describes himself as the "first journalist-terrorist in history." The Belarusian secret 
service KGB added the 26-year-old opposition blogger to its terror list in November 2020. 
The irony in Pratasevich's reaction was replaced by harsh reality on Sunday. Belarusian leader Alexander 
Lukashenko ordered a passenger plane to land in Minsk, grounding the Ryanair flight with the blogger on board 
under the pretext of a bomb threat. Upon landing, the blogger was arrested. 
Since then, the whole world has learned his name, and the European Union cut flight connections to and from 
Belarus in response to the arrest. 
In his first video from pre-trial detention, circulated Tuesday evening by media outlets close to the state, Pratasevich 
is visibly wearing make-up, with dark spots on his forehead. The blogger assures the camera that he is being 
treated well and will testify in the criminal proceedings for mass unrest. Pratasevich's parents tried to read how he 
was really doing from his face, instead of his words. 
His father Dmitry Pratasevich told the web portal "The Insider" that his son may have been beaten and that his nose 
may have been broken. 
Kicked out of school 
For Pratasevich, the recent events are the culmination of his now ten years as an opposition activist. His name 
appeared in news coverage across the country for the first time when he was taken away as a 16-year-old student 
in Minsk in 2011 ― with shoulder-length hair and head proudly raised. 
The arrest occurred during protests against Lukashenko which were much smaller at the time than they are today. 
Pratasevich was additionally expelled from school despite earning good grades. Also in 2011, he was arrested as 
the suspected operator of an opposition social network. 
There were reports that he had left his parents' home over disagreements. His father was an officer and taught at 
the military academy, but later denied that there had been a dispute with his son. 
Pratasevich was involved in the opposition youth organization "Young Front" and studied journalism at the 
university in Minsk. He was expelled from university, allegedly for formal reasons, but he believes that the move 
was politically motivated. 
Belarus : Who is Raman Pratasevich?
In 2017, he received a Havel scholarship at the Belarusian service of the US foreign broadcaster "Radio Free 
Europe/Radio Liberty" (RFE/RL), based in Prague. He worked as a freelance journalist for various media, including 
leading Belarusian web portal Tut.by, which was recently blocked by the government. He also covered the war in 
eastern Ukraine as a photojournalist. 
'Man of the moment' 
Pratasevich worked as a reporter and photographer at the Polish-Belarusian broadcaster "Euroradio".  
"Raman was a man of the moment," recalls current editor-in-chief Pavel Sverdlov in an interview with DW. "He 
could quickly pack up his equipment bag and immediately set out to investigate." 
Pratasevich was a good journalist, the editor-in-chief said, but he could not organize or coordinate protests. "He 
never had the goal of directing people or organizing anything." 
According to Sverdlov, Pratasevich is a caring person: "We once sent him out into the country to photograph local 
activists. He came back with a stray cat that he had met on the street and couldn't leave behind." 
Worried for his life, Pratasevich moved to Poland in late 2019 and became editor-in-chief of the opposition 
Telegram channels "Nexta" and "Nexta Live" (Belarusian for "someone"). That's what eventually led to his undoing. 
Sending videos at lightning speed 
There are several cases pending against Pratasevich in Belarus, and he faces a prison sentence of up to 15 years. 
The central reason is likely his activity on the Telegram channel "Nexta" after the presidential election in August 
2020, when President Lukashenko again declared himself the winner. 
The two channels "Nexta" and "Nexta Live" became a leading source of information about the protests, spreading 
amateur photos and videos at lightning speed. 
"People understood that information could be sent to us safely," Pratasevich said in a DW interview before the 
presidential election. 
"Nexta" was founded by blogger and YouTuber Stepan Putilo (who has also been known by his pseudonym Stepan 
Svetlov) along with other opposition figures. He runs the channels from Poland and was awarded the EU 
Parliament's Sakharov Prize in December 2020. In some cases, however, false information is said to have been 
spread via the channel, for example about the alleged use of Russian special forces against demonstrators in 
Minsk. 
Putilo is also on the KGB's terror list. "Nexta" is not a purely journalistic product. It looks more like a digital 
mouthpiece for demonstrators. Youtuber Putilo doesn't see problem with that. In a DW interview, he spoke of a 
"hybrid format" in which the boundaries between journalism and activism have blurred. At the height of the protests, 
the number of "Nexta" subscribers rose from about 300,000 to 1.8 million users within a few days. Currently, it 
stands at around 1.2 million. 
Move from Warsaw to Vilnius 
Pratasevich and Putilo parted ways at the end of September 2020, when the blogger moved from Warsaw to 
Vilnius, where former presidential candidate and opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya also lives in exile. 
According to media reports, he became involved in her team and was also editor-in-chief of another opposition 
Telegram channel. 
In interviews, Pratasevich's mother Natalia describes her son as a "fighter" and a "strong personality." She says her 
son's involvement in the opposition forced the family to move to Poland in August 2020. 
They had been threatened and tailed, Pratasevich's mother said. In early May 2021, two weeks before his arrest, 
Pratasevich reported on Twitter that President Lukashenko had stripped his now-retired father of his military rank. In 
retrospect, this appears to have been a final warning.

 Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko addresses the Parliament in Minsk, Belarus, Wednesday, May 26, 
2021. Lukashenko is defending his action to divert a European flight that triggered bruising European Union 
sanctions and accused the West of waging a "hybrid war" to "strangle" the ex-Soviet nation. On Sunday, May 23,

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Belarus' authoritarian president defended Wednesday his decision to tell a passenger jet to 
land in his country and accused European leaders of waging a 'hybrid war' to 'strangle' his nation by ordering up 
new sanctions for diverting the flight and arresting an opposition journalist who was aboard. 
 Speaking before lawmakers and top officials, President Alexander Lukashenko maintained his contention that there 
was a bomb threat against the Ryanair flight and called it an 'absolute lie' that a fighter jet he scrambled was forcing 
the passenger plane to land in Minsk. The carrier has said its crew was instructed to land. The plane was searched 
once on the ground, and no bomb was found — but Raman Pratasevich, a 26-year-old journalist and activist, and 
his Russian girlfriend were detained. 
 'I acted in a lawful way, protecting people in line with international rules,' said 66-year-old Lukashenko, who has 
ruled the ex-Soviet nation with an iron fist for more than a quarter-century, relentlessly stifling dissent. 
 He doubled down on the idea that there was a grave security risk, saying the plane was flying not far away from the 
Astravets nuclear power plant and adding that he ordered air defense systems on high alert. 'I had to protect 
people, I was thinking about the country's security,' he said. 
 But European Union leaders have denounced the move to divert the plane — which was traveling between two EU 
countries and being operated by an airline based in a third — as an act of piracy. They quickly agreed to ban 
Belarusian airlines from using the airspace and airports of the 27-nation bloc and urged European airlines to avoid 
Belarus' airspace. They agreed to draft more sanctions on officials linked to the diversion and ones targeting 
businesses that are the main cash earners for Lukashenko's regime. 
 Lukashenko derided that response. 
Belarusian leader defends diversion of flight that drew fury
 'Our ill-wishers outside and inside the country have changed their methods of attacking the state,' Lukashenko 
said. 'That's why they switched from organizing riots to trying to strangle us.' (Ad) Move over GW Pharma. This 
stock is targeting rare diseases too, and ready to take off 
 He added: 'It's no longer just an information war, it's a modern hybrid war and we need to do everything to prevent 
it from spilling into a hot conflict.' 
 Lukashenko has faced unprecedented pressure at home with months of protests triggered by his reelection to a 
sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition rejected as rigged. But he has only doubled down on 
repression, and more than 35,000 people have been arrested since the protests began, with thousands beaten. 
 Pratasevich, who left Belarus in 2019, has become a top foe of Lukashenko with a popular messaging app he ran 
playing a key role in helping organize the huge protests. After his detention, the journalist was seen in a brief video 
clip on Belarusian state television late Monday, speaking rapidly to say that he was confessing to some of the 
charges authorities have leveled against him. A U.N. official expressed concern for his welfare, saying his 
appearance likely was not voluntary and there seemed to be bruising to his face. 
 On Wednesday, Lukashenko threatened that Belarus would retaliate against the EU by weakening its border 
controls halting Western-bound illegal migration and drug trafficking. 
 'We were stopping migrants and drugs — now you will catch them and eat them yourself,' he said. 
 Prime Minister Roman Golovchenko also warned that the country could halt Western cargo shipments via Belarus. 
 'Our measures would be quite painful for the countries that have taken an openly hostile stance — from import 
bans to restrictions on transit,' he said. 'Still, we hope that those who rush to pass the point of no return to sober up 
and think twice before entering a slippery path of economic war in which there will be no winners.' 
 Pratasevich had been charged in absentia with staging mass riots and fanning social hatred. Those carry a prison 
sentence of up to 15 years, and some fear Pratasevich could face more serious charges, including some that carry 
the death penalty. 
 Lukashenko alleged Wednesday that Pratasevich and his associates were working in cahoots with foreign spy 
agencies to 'organize a massacre and a bloody rebellion in Belarus.'

7 Stocks to Support Your New Year's Resolutions[2] After a year like 2020, many Americans figure that just getting 
to 2021 was enough. But for many people, the start of a new year still means making resolutions. And while many 
Americans are still waking up to Groundhog's Day, there is hope that things will look dramatically different in 
September than they do right now. 
 Some of the most popular resolutions include losing weight, exercising more, or taking steps to get our life and/or 
business more organized. And many pure-play companies lean into these trends and are doing well. 
 As an alternative to this, you can also invest in companies that are not pure plays but can still benefit from 
consumers looking to start fresh. Owning these stocks helps you manage your risk. If the trend holds, you can ride 
the wave. On the other hand, if the wave turns into a ripple, the stocks have other catalysts to get them through. 
 In this special presentation, we'll take a look at both of these categories. We've got several pure-play companies 
that let investors buy stocks in companies benefiting from these trends. We'll also give you a few stocks that fall in 
the latter category. 
 These are stocks that you might buy at any time and for many reasons. However, they present excellent buys as 
the new year begins.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Belarus' authoritarian president lashed out Wednesday at Europe for trying to 'strangle' his 
country with sanctions over the diversion of a passenger jet, and he accused a dissident journalist arrested after the 
flight landed in Minsk of working to foment a 'bloody rebellion." 
 In a long, rambling speech to lawmakers and top officials, President Alexander Lukashenko defended his decision 
to tell the Ryanair flight to land in his country, maintaining his contention that there was a bomb threat against it. He 
called it an 'absolute lie' that a fighter jet he scrambled forced the plane to land.  
European Union leaders have denounced the move as an act of air piracy. Ryanair has said its crew was instructed 
to land. The plane was searched on the ground, and no bomb was found — but Raman Pratasevich, a 26-year-old 
journalist and activist, and his Russian girlfriend were detained. 
 'I acted in a lawful way, protecting people in line with international rules,' said the 66-year-old Lukashenko, who has 
ruled the ex-Soviet nation with an iron fist for more than a quarter century, relentlessly stifling dissent. 
 He fumed at the EU, accusing the West of waging what he said was 'no longer just an information war but a 
modern hybrid war' against his country of 9.3 million. 
 Lukashenko doubled down on the idea that there was a grave security risk, saying the plane was not far away from 
the Astravets nuclear power plant and that he had ordered air defense systems to high alert. 
 'We acted in strict accordance with aviation safety rules,' he said, claiming the crew hesitated for about a quarter 
hour before following the Belarusian flight controllers' directions to land in Minsk. 'It's the captain who makes a 
decision according to all instructions and rules, and we offered our help. The captain was thinking for 15 minutes 
and consulting the bosses and Vilnius airport staff.' (Ad) This just in! Strange laboratory creates psychedelic

Defiant Belarus leader slams EU sanctions on plane diversion
 He said the crew hesitated for so long that Belarusian authorities no longer expected the crew to turn back to 
Minsk, since the plane was already near the Lithuanian border, but they did. The Belarusian MiG-29 was sent to 
help direct the Ryanair plane to land and facilitate communication in case of problems. 
 'They should have been thankful to us!' Lukashenko exclaimed. 'We did everything to save people.' 
 But he also alleged that Pratasevich and his associates were working with foreign spy agencies to 'organize a 
massacre and a bloody rebellion in Belarus.' 
 He also warned his other foes abroad that the authorities will go after them. 
 'We know your faces, and it's just a matter of time for you to be brought to account before the Belarusian people,' 
he said. 
 Lukashenko has faced unprecedented pressure at home with months of protests following his reelection to a sixth 
term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition rejects as rigged. But he has only increased the crackdown, and 
more than 35,000 people have been arrested since the protests began, with thousands beaten. 
 Pratasevich, who left Belarus in 2019, has become a top foe of Lukashenko. He ran a popular messaging app that 
had a key role in helping organize the huge protests.  
 In Poland, Pratasevich's parents said they fear for his welfare and made an emotional plea for assistance. 
 'World, please stand up and help. I urge you very much because they will kill him, they will kill him!' Natalia 
Pratasevich said through tears in an interview in Warsaw. 
 Her son appeared in a video broadcast on Belarusian state TV on Monday in which he confessed to some of the 
charges against him. 
 Natalia Pratasevich said her son's nose appeared to broken and he seemed to be wearing makeup to cover facial 
bruises. The journalist's father, Dmitry Pratasevich, said his son must have been forced to make the confession. 
 Ivan Tertel, head of the Belarusian state security agency that still goes under its Soviet-era acronym KGB, said 
Pratasevich told investigators about 'the sponsors of subversive activities against Belarus, its mechanisms and 
special services and politicians behind it' and promised to release details soon. 
 Pratasevich, who fled to Lithuania in 2019, was charged in absentia with staging mass riots and fanning social 
hatred. Those carry a prison sentence of up to 15 years, and some fear he could face more serious charges, 
including some that carry the death penalty. 
 In response to Pratasevich's arrest and the diversion of the flight, which was traveling between two EU countries, 
European leaders agreed to ban Belarusian airlines from using the airspace and airports of the 27-nation bloc. They 
urged European airlines to avoid Belarus airspace. They agreed to draft more sanctions on officials linked to the 
diversion and ones targeting businesses provide income for Lukashenko's government. 
 'Our ill-wishers outside and inside the country have changed their methods of attacking the state,' he said. 'That's 
why they switched from organizing riots to trying to strangle us.' 
 He said Western sanctions are driven by "their envy, helplessness and anger that they have failed to carry out an 
armed rebellion and a coup in Belarus.' 
 Lukashenko said Belarus "is in the center of Europe, and if something flares up here, it could trigger another world 
war.' 
 'We will respond firmly to any sanctions, attacks and provocations. Not because we want to provoke a fight in the 
center of the continent. We don't want it, we have had enough of it, but because you in the West are giving us no 
other choice,' he said. 
 He promised to retaliate by loosening border controls against Western-bound illegal migration and drug trafficking. 
 'We were stopping migrants and drugs — now you will catch them and eat them yourself,' he said. 
 Prime Minister Roman Golovchenko said the country could halt Western cargo shipments via Belarus. 
 'Our measures would be quite painful for the countries that have taken an openly hostile stance — from import 
bans to restrictions on transit,' he said. 'Still, we hope that those who rush to pass the point of no return to sober up 
and think twice before entering a slippery path of economic war in which there will be no winners.' 
 Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei also said Belarus could opt out of the EU's Eastern Partnership in view of the new 
sanctions. The program is part of EU efforts to help Belarus and other ex-Soviet nations distance themselves from 
Moscow's influence and integrate into the West.

Featured Article: What is the CAC 40 Index?[1] 
7 Electric Vehicle (EV) Stocks That Are Ready to Rebound [2] The electric vehicle (EV) sector was nearly as frothy 
as the 'pandemic stocks' in 2020. It wasn't that the EV sector was dormant during the Trump administration. 
Defiant Belarus leader slams EU sanctions on plane diversion
 But, as the saying goes, elections have consequences. And Wall Street understands they can make money in any 
administration. And as a bet that Joe Biden would win the presidency, electric vehicle stocks soared. 
 For starters, the Biden administration has already said it will prioritize climate change like no administration ever 
has. And one way they are going to do that is to incentivize the production and purchase of electric vehicles. 
 And to take advantage of this shift towards electric vehicle stocks, many private companies raced to get in on the 
action. The preferred way for many of these companies to go public was via a Special Purpose Acquisition 
Company (SPAC). A SPAC is basically a shortcut to the traditional IPO process. 
 However, what goes up frequently goes down and since late February, EV stocks have been getting battered. But 
this is creating an opportunity because the electric vehicle is still supposed to see exceptional growth over the next 
five years. 
 To help you take advantage of this we've created this special presentation that includes seven stocks that appear 
to be ready to take the next leg up.

 The parents of the young opposition activist and blogger detained in Minsk after the passenger jet he was on board 
was forced to land in the Belarusian capital earlier this week are pleading for the international community to help 
free their son. 
'I'm asking, I'm begging, I'm calling on the whole international community to save him,' Raman Pratasevich's 
mother, Natalia, told AFP. Speaking from her home in Poland, she added, 'Please save him. They're going to kill 
him there.' 
'They sent a fighter jet to get this young man! It's an act of terrorism — I don't think you can call it anything else. 
He's been taken hostage. This is an act of pure revenge!' she said. 
Her husband, Dmitry Pratasevich, a former soldier, said: 'His lawyer tried to see him today but she was turned 
down. She could not see him. We still don't know if he is in there, what his condition is, how he is feeling.' 
Their anguish was matched by the mother of Sofia Sapega, another opposition activist, who was also removed from 
the Ryanair flight in Minsk. A video of Sapega, a Russian national and friend of Pratasevich, was released Tuesday 
by Belarusian authorities as they announced she would be held for at least two months.

undated photo taken in 2019. In the video, Sapega, according to her mother, appears to be confessing to editing an 
opposition Telegram channel that publishes personal information of Belarusian policemen. Her mother said it 
appeared she was speaking under duress for the video, in which she provides her personal details and says she 
edited a platform 'which publishes the personal information of officials from internal affairs bodies.' 
Sofia's mother, Anna Dudich, told Russian television she was 'shocked' by the video. 'Either I'm confused, or it's a 
dream, or it's a setup,' Dudich said. She told Western media outlets that her daughter was talking in an unusual

manner. 'She sways, eyes in the sky — as if afraid of forgetting something.' Dudich added: 'We are now packing 
warm clothes. We will go to Minsk. I want to try to give her a parcel. I saw she only had a thin jacket.' 
Sapega and Pratasevich were detained Sunday when the Ryanair plane they were flying on from Athens to Vilnius 
was diverted by Belarus authorities to land in Minsk. Western countries, including the United States, have accused 
Belarus of committing air piracy and hijacking the Ryanair plane after it was rerouted over a false bomb threat.

intercepted and diverted to Minsk by Belarus authorities lands at Vilnius International Airport, its initial destination, in 
Lithuania, May 23, 2021. Sapega's lawyer, Alexander Filanovich, told RBC, a Russian news outlet, that Sapega 
was interrogated Tuesday and charged with criminal offenses. Russian foreign ministry officials say she's being 
charged with 'committing crimes under several articles of the Criminal Code of Belarus during the period from 
August to September 2020.' That was during the height of nationwide protests against the fifth re-election of 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. 
The Belarusian opposition and Western nations have condemned the election as rigged. 
Sapega's mother said her daughter was in Lithuania at the time and wasn't involved in the demonstrations in 
Belarus. Sapega, who is also a student at the European Humanities University, EHU, in Lithuania, and Pratasevich, 
26, face stiff penalties if convicted. Pratasevich, whom Belarusian authorities have placed on a terrorism list on the 
ground that he incited mass protests, could be handed a death sentence, opposition groups fear. Some analysts 
say a 15-year prison term is more likely. 
Torture 
Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya told a news conference Tuesday that a video of 
Pratasevich released by Belarusian authorities suggested he had been tortured. 'He said that he was treated 
lawfully, but he's clearly beaten and under pressure. There is no doubt that he was tortured. He was taken hostage,' 
she told reporters in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital.

are being held in the Okrestina pre-trial detention center in Minsk, where thousands of anti-Lukashenko protesters 
and activists have been detained the past few months. Belarusian and international rights groups, including 
Amnesty International, say many detainees arrested for protesting are beaten and tortured in the center, which is 
overseen by the Investigative Committee of the Republic of Belarus, part of the country's interior ministry. 
Rights groups have documented three rapes. And in October 2020, opposition groups released a video purportedly 
showing fresh detainees being beaten in so-called 'welcome parades.' 
At a meeting in Brussels on Monday, leaders of the 27 European Union member states called for all EU-based 
airlines to cease all flights over Belarus, and they promised further economic sanctions. 
Ukraine's response 
Separately, Belarusian neighbor Ukraine has suspended all air travel with Belarus, and the country's prime minister, 
Denys Shmygal, has ordered all Ukrainian airlines to avoid flying in Belarusian airspace, which will add, according 
to Ukrainian Airlines, 40 minutes to flights from Kyiv heading to the Baltic states and Finland.

"Belarusian authorities stop at nothing in persecuting dissenters. Even its airspace is unsafe now,' Ukraine's 
Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. 'Ukraine has always been interested in a democratic Belarus where

The EU and Ukraine air bans will result in a loss to Belarus of about $70 million in overflight fees, civil aviation 
associations reckon.

said. 'That's why they switched from organizing riots to trying to strangle us.' 
 He added: 'It's no longer just an information war, it's a modern hybrid war and we need to do everything to prevent 
it from spilling into a hot conflict.' 
 Lukashenko threatened that Belarus would retaliate against the EU by weakening its border controls halting 
Western-bound illegal migration and drug trafficking. 
 'We were stopping migrants and drugs — now you will catch them and eat them yourself,' he said. 
 Prime Minister Roman Golovchenko said that the country could halt Western cargo shipments via Belarus. 
 'Our measures would be quite painful for the countries that have taken an openly hostile stance — from import 
bans to restrictions on transit,' he said. 'Still, we hope that those who rush to pass the point of no return to sober up 
and think twice before entering a slippery path of economic war in which there will be no winners.' 
 Foreign minister Vladimir Makei also warned that Belarus could opt out of the EU's Eastern Partnership in view of 
the new sanctions. The program is part of the EU's efforts to help Belarus and other ex-Soviet nations distance 
themselves from Moscow's influence and integrate into the West.

7 Stocks to Watch When Student Debt Forgiveness Gets Passed[2] Now that the Biden administration is fully in 
charge, student debt forgiveness has moved to the front burner. Consider these numbers. There is an estimated 
$1.7 trillion in student debt. The average student carries approximately $30,000 in student loans. 
 If $10,000 of student debt were to be canceled, there are estimates that one-third of borrowers (between 15 million 
to 16.3 million) would become debt-free. Of course, if the number hits $50,000 as some lawmakers are suggesting 
the impact would even greater. 
 Putting aside personal thoughts on the wisdom of pursuing this path, it has the potential to unleash a substantial 
stimulus into the economy. 
 And as an investor, it's fair to ask where that money would go. After all, there's no harm in having investors profit 
from this stimulus as well. 
 A counter-argument is that the absence of one monthly payment may not provide enough money to make an 
impact. However, Senator Elizabeth Warren referred to the effect student loans have in preventing many in the 
millennial and Gen-Z generations from pursuing big picture life goals such as buying a house, starting a business, 
or starting a family. 
 With that in mind, we've put together this special presentation that looks at 7 stocks that are likely to benefit if 
borrowers are set free from the burden of student loans.

May 26, 2021( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Belarusian authorities detained a 26-year-old journalist after grounding his Lithuania-bound flight. Roman 
Protasevich is a vocal critic of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Protasevich's activism against his 
country's tyranny dates back to 2011, when he was 16 years old. See more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
The dramatic arrest of Belarusian dissident Roman Protasevich drew international interest this week, when 
Belarusian authorities took the 26-year-old journalist into custody after grounding his Lithuania-bound Ryanair flight. 
Protasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega[2], were aboard flight FR4978 from Athens to Lithuania before pilots 
were alerted of a bogus security threat and ordered to land in Minsk. Belarusian state media reported it was 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko[3] who gave an "unequivocal order" to ground the passenger jet in 
Minsk. 
Belarusian KGB agents[4] took Protasevich, a vocal critic of Lukashenko, into custody after the flight landed in 
Minsk, despite data on Flightradar24[5] showing the plane made a sharp U-turn to land in Belarus, as it was closer 
to its destination in Lithuania than Minsk, Insider's Cheryl Teh[6] reported. 
Just before Belarusian authorities arrested Protasevich, one passenger aboard the plane - solely identified as 
Mantas - told Reuters[7] they saw him give a laptop and phone to a female passenger who was traveling with him. It 
was not immediately clear if that female passenger was Sapega, who was also detained[8] after the flight was 
grounded in Minsk and could face charges[9] in Belarus. 
Protasevich grew up in Minsk, and has been an opponent of Lukashenko's regime for a decade, first demonstrating 
his opposition to the Belarusian government in a 2011 video[10] posted to YouTube. Protasevich, then 16 years old, 
was among those detained by state authorities after sitting on a bench watching a "clapping protest" - in which a 
flash mob clapped in protest of the government but never audibly expressing their grievances, according to a report 
by The New York Times[11]. 
"For the first time I saw all the dirt that is happening in our country," he said in the video, citing The Times report. 
"Just as an example: Five huge OMON riot police officers beat women. A mother with her child was thrown into a 
police van. It was disgusting. After that everything changed fundamentally." 
Meet Roman Protasevich, the 26-year-old journalist with 2 million followers who was arrested by Belarusian 
authorities after his plane was forced to land
Protasevich's mother told The Times that, soon after, her son's school expelled him. He was homeschooled for six 
months because no other schools would take him. 
"Imagine being a 16-year-old and being expelled from school," Protasevich's mother told The Times, citing the 2011 
incident - which she described as an "injustice" and an "insult" - as the reason he was so entrenched in opposition 
activism. "That is how he began his activism as a 16-year-old."

Protasevich went on to study journalism at Belarusian State University but ran into legal trouble and was unable to 
finish his degree, The Times reported. 
He was frequently detained and jailed as he worked freelance for opposition-focused news outlets, before he 
decided to move to Poland and work on leaking videos and documents related to the Lukashenko regime. He 
cofounded and serves as the editor-in-chief of Nexta, a news outlet based in Poland[13] reporting on opposition 
efforts against Lukashenko, for the next 10 months. 
In 2019, he moved back to Minsk until authorities arrested another opposition journalist Vladimir Chudentsov, 
prompting Protasevich to once again flee to Poland with his parents, who were also under government scrutiny. 
Amid the controversial 2020 presidential election in Belarus, Protasevich took a step further in his "activist 
journalism" and began to cross into the realm of political activism - not only reporting on protests against 
Lukashenko's regime but also organizing them. 
Stispan Putsila, a fellow dissident who worked alongside Protasevich at Nexta, told The Times Protasevich became 
"more interested in organizing street action" following the 2020 presidential election in Belarus, in which allegations 
of a rigged election spurred nationwide protests after Lukashenko won a sixth term by a landslide. 
The European Union also imposed sanctions on several Belarusian officials, including Lukashenko, in the wake of 
the contested presidential elections in August. 
"I would not say he was more radical, but he definitely became more resolute," Putsila said of Protasevich's 
emerging activism in light of the elections. 
In an interview[14] with The Times last year, Protasevich said "we're journalists, but we also have to do something 
else." 
"No one else is left," he continued. "The opposition leaders are in prison." 
In a government video reposted by the Minsk reporter Hanna Liubakova[15] following his arrest earlier this week, 
Protasevich confirmed he was detained by authorities at Minsk National Airport by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
He said he's had "no health concerns" and was treated "correctly" and "lawfully" when taken into custody. 
Protasevich said he was cooperating with authorities and continued to "provide evidence related to the mass rallies 
in Minsk," according to a translation by Insider. 
The Times reported his friends said he made the aforementioned confession under duress as he was in custody at 
the Minsk National Airport. On the contrary, Putsila told The Times Protasevich's character "has always been very 
resolute" and that he "refused to live in fear." 
"The Lukashenko regime considers Roman one of its main enemies," Putsila told The Times. "Maybe it is right."

 The Belarusian leader said "ill-wishers" are "trying to strangle Belarus" in his first speech since a commercial flight 
was intercepted and a critical blogger arrested.Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko hit out at Western powers 
on Wednesday, saying that his country's "ill-wishers" are "trying to strangle Belarus." 
It's the first time Lukashenko has spoken in public since a Ryanair plane was diverted over the weekend and 
dissident blogger Raman Pratasevich and law student Sofia Sapega were taken into custody. 
What did Lukashenko say? 
In his speech, Lukashenko said that "attacks" on Belarus have crossed "red lines." 
"As we predicted, our ill-wishers at home and abroad have changed their methods of attacking the state. They have 
crossed many red lines and crossed boundaries of common sense and human morality," Lukashenko said as he 
addressed members of parliament, the Belta state-run news agency reported. 
He also said that a bomb threat, which Belarusian authorities said was behind the plane's landing in Minsk, came 
from Switzerland, and that outside forces were waging a "hybrid war" against the country. 
Lukashenko additionally called it an "absolute lie" that a fighter jet forced the plane to land, and said Belarus had 
acted "lawfully, to protect people." 
"I acted lawfully to protect our people," he said, also accusing Pratasevich of planning to start a "bloody rebellion." 
What happened with the flight? 
On Sunday, Belarusian authorities forced a Ryanair plane to land as it was flying to Lithuanian capital, Vilnius. 
Upon landing in Minsk, authorities and took blogger Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, into 
custody. 
Prior to his arrest, Pratasevich — a vocal critic of Lukashenko — was traveling from Greece to Lithuania. 
Minsk ordered the commercial plane flying over its airspace to land, claiming a bomb was onboard — an 
explanation German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called "completely implausible." 
The EU responded by slapping sanctions on Belarus, including a ban on Belarusian airlines using EU airspace or 
airports. 
Following Lukashenko's comments on Wednesday, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said it was 
advising EU airlines, as well as non-EU carriers flying to or from the bloc, to avoid airspace above Belarus.  
"The circumstances surrounding this action cast serious doubts on the respect shown by Belarus for international 
civil aviation rules," the EASA said in a safety bulletin. 
Belarus: Lukashenko slams Western response to forced plane diversion
"The actions undertaken by Belarus amounted to an increased safety risk for the [Ryanair] flight and put into 
question the ability of Belarus to provide safe air navigation services." 
Opposition announces new protests 
Meanwhile, the Belarusian opposition it is preparing to stage a new phase of active anti-government protests in 
Belarus, exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said. 
Mass protests erupted against President Alexander Lukashenko last summer after he declared victory in a 
presidential election that his opponents said was rigged. The protests slowed down after a sweeping crackdown 
implemented by authorities.  
"There's nothing more to wait for, we have to stop the terror once and for all," Tsikhanouskaya said in a statement 
on social media.

 One of Sofia Sapega's biggest concerns might have been defending her thesis, then the flight she and her 
boyfriend, Raman Pratasevich, were on was forced to the ground in Belarus. Now she has many other worries.After 
a two-week vacation in Greece, 23-year-old Sofia Sapega was returning to her university studies in the Lithuanian 
capital, Vilnius, on Sunday. But plans to defend her master's thesis were put on hold after Belarus falsely claimed 
there was a bomb on her Ryanair flight, forced the plane to land in Minsk and took her into custody.  
She was traveling with her boyfriend, Raman Pratasevich, a Belarusian blogger and prominent critic of authoritarian 
leader Alexander Lukashenko. As soon as the plane was diverted to Minsk, Pratasevich realized he would be 
arrested and handed Sapega his laptop and phone, a passenger on the flight told Reuters news agency. But 
Belarusian authorities detained her, saying she will be held in pre-trial detention for two months. 
Russian news outlet Novaya Gazeta reported Sapega, a Russian citizen, could face charges of plotting riots and 
organizing an action that violates public order. The Russian Foreign Ministry has promised to offer her consular 
services.  
Sapega under 'psychological pressure' 
On Tuesday, Sapega appeared in a video, saying she was a publisher of a Telegram channel that illegally 
disclosed the private information of officers in the Belarusian Interior Ministry. 
Sapega is well and has not complained of inappropriate treatment, the RIA news agency reported, citing the 
Russian Embassy to Belarus. 
But the Belarusian opposition members said the recording, which shows Sapega talking fast and making little eye 
contact with the camera, was coerced and possibly made under duress. They also said Pratasevich's alleged 
confessional video, in which he has dark marks on his forehead, was forced. 
"Clearly, Raman is beaten in prison," exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya tweeted. "He and Sofia are 
under psychological pressure." 
Sapega's mother, Anna Dudich, said there was no reason for her daughter's arrest. 
"My hopes are now probably based on a miracle and on the knowledge that my daughter is definitely not guilty of 
anything," she told Reuters from Lida in Belarus. "She simply showed up in the wrong place at the wrong time." 
Dudich said she worries about her daughter's safety and health in Belarusian detention. The last time she heard 
from Sapega was in the form of a text when the plane was forced to land in Minsk. 
It only read "Mama." 
EU leaders call for immediate release 
Who is Sofia Sapega, girlfriend of Belarusian blogger Raman Pratasevich?
The arrest of Pratasevich and Sapega caused international outrage. EU leaders have called the plane diversion a 
"hijacking" and "state piracy" and are demanding the immediate release of the detained couple.  
On Monday, they announced additional economic sanctions on individuals involved in the flight diversion as well as 
businesses supporting Lukashenko's regime. The EU has progressively been restricting key political figures in 
Belarus since October 2020 as a response to the government crackdown on peaceful protesters. 
This time around, the 27-nation bloc also prohibited Belarusian airlines from flying in EU airspace or landing at EU 
airports. Some European carriers like Lufthansa and KLM have stopped flying to Belarus. 
"Lukashenko and his regime have to understand this will have severe consequences," European Commission 
President Ursula von der Leyen said.

 YouTube took action against a pro-Belarus channel for inappropriate ads this week, according to Rest of World.[1] 
The account's ads used footage from Roman Protasevich's[2] confession video released by Belarusian authorities. 
Protasevich's father told Reuters on Tuesday his son's statements seem coerced. See more stories on Insider's 
business page[3]. 
YouTube took action this week after advertisements that featured videos posted by Belarusian authorities of 
detained journalist and dissident Roman Protasevich[4] and his partner Sofia Sapega[5] ran on the platform, 
according to Rest of World.[6]  
Protasevich and Sapega were arrested in Minsk on Sunday after Belarusian officials sent a fighter jet to divert a 
Ryanair flight[7] from Athens to Vilnius the couple was traveling on, sparking international outrage. In the following 
days, Belarusian authorities released videos[8] of both Protasevich and Sapega talking about organizing mass 
protests against President Alexander Lukashenko last year.  
Protasevich's father, Dzmitry, told Reuters on Tuesday his son's statements in the video appeared coerced.[9]  
"I think he was forced. It's not his words, it's not his intonation of speech - he is acting very reserved, and you can 
tell he is nervous," he said.  
Following the release of the videos, several[10] Twitter[11] users[12] noticed YouTube ads that showed footage 
from the Belarusian-released statements from Protasevich and Sapega. -Tadeusz Giczan (@TadeuszGiczan) May 
25, 2021[13]  
Rest of World traced the ads to a pro-Belarusian government channel[14] whose name translates to "Belarus, 
country for life." The patriotic channel has fewer than 2,000 subscribers and features content praising Belarusian 
security forces and mocking opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. Protasevich and Sapega's videos are 
both featured on the channel as well.  
Screenshots[15] posted[16] on social media suggest the advertisements directed viewers to a Telegram channel of 
pro-government content with nearly 80,000 subscribers, according to Rest of World. Another Twitter user shared a 
screenshot[17] of an apparent advertisement that featured Sapega's confession video as well. 
A spokesperson for YouTube's parent company, Google, told Rest of World's Louise Matsakis that the company 
had taken action against both of the advertisements for violating its content policies. 
YouTube said it removed 2 ads featuring videos of Belarus hostages' admission videos: report
"YouTube has always had strict policies around the type of content that is allowed to serve as ads on our platform," 
a spokesperson told Matsakis. "We quickly remove any ads that violate these policies." -Louise Matsakis 
(@lmatsakis) May 26, 2021[18]  
Google's publicly available guidelines[19] on "Sensitive Events" say it does not allow ads that "potentially profit from 
or exploit a sensitive event with significant social, cultural, or political impact, such as civil emergencies, natural 
disasters, public health emergencies, terrorism, and related activities, conflict, or mass acts of violence."  
The platform has previously come under fire for both its content[20] and advertising[21] practices. The site has 
traditionally allowed political advertisement, though Google temporarily banned[22] all political ads after the 2020 
election. 
According to Rest of World, social media users last year complained online about advertisements on YouTube 
promoting Belarusian government propaganda that appeared to come from the same "Belarus, country for life" 
channel. The company reportedly did not respond to Matsakis' questions about any past action against the channel.

May 26, 2021( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 ATHENS - An incident, in which a Belarusian warplane intercepted a flight between EU-members Greece and 
Lithuania and forced it down in Minsk on May 23, where a dissident journalist Raman Pratasevich was arrested 
might have set a dangerous precedent for international aviation. 
 'So far, air traffic regulations were the area where international cooperation worked largely reliably and not 
disturbed by unpredictable political needs,' GLOBSEC Policy Institute Director Alena Kudzko told New Europe on 
May 26, adding that this incident might change the trust that the air space is safe. 
 In an incident denounced by Western countries as 'state piracy,' Belarus' authoritarian President Alexander 
Lukashenko reportedly personally ordered the MiG-29 fighter jet to intercept the Ryanair plane to the Minsk airport 
after a bomb threat. 
 'If it worked for Lukashenko, why wouldn't any government ground flights at will to go after wanted passengers?' 
Kudzko asked. 'This incident also directly endangers the safety of all passengers on board. Airlines and individual 
travelers might want to think twice about the routes they are to take,' she added. 
 According to the GLOBSEC expert who was born and grew up in Belarus, the harsh international criticism and 
reaction aims to avoid the incidence becoming a precedent as it would signify lawlessness in airspace. Kudzko 
noted, however, the sanctions, including making Belarus effectively a no-fly zone and banning the Belarusian 
national carrier from flying to European countries, are a message not only to Lukashenko though. 'This is also a 
message to any other government, any other regime, or nongovernmental actor: this behavior is not going to be 
tolerated, do not even think about it,' she said. 
 Asked if EU and international response was enough, Kudzko said the European Union and other countries are 
reacting both swiftly and consequentially. 'It is an important and clear sign that this behavior - by anyone, not just 
Lukashenko - is not acceptable,' she said. 
 A different question is also what impact the sanctions will have on Belarus and the Lukashenko-led authorities. 
'The EU has done an impressive job mobilizing within 24 hours. This quick reaction changes the dynamics of the 
situation and clearly indicates not only the position of the EU but also sets a path to action that goes beyond strong 
verbal statements. Of course, the sanctions have not entered into force yet - it was a political agreement, the details 
still need to be worked out,' Kudzko said. 
Belarus skyjacking to get dissident journalist rattles EU
 She stressed that any sanctions should be thought about only as part of the strategy towards a particular country 
or a particular problem. 'Sanctions alone, especially not particularly strong ones as in the case of Belarus until now, 
are rarely sufficient to change the regime. As part of the broader package, they do play an important role in 
defunding the regime, undermining its economic and political sustainability, and narrowing the scope of maneuver 
for the authorities. Also, to have a painful effect, sanctions need time,' Kudzko said, explaining that with each 
passing month and year, cumulative effect is stronger. 
 'When I am talking about a broader package, it is important to remember that there are other policies in place, 
introduced by the EU and other Western countries, that also play an important role and that need to be further 
strengthened,' Kudzko said. 'Here, I mean support to the victims of repressions, support to independent media, visa 
free provisions for Belarusians, economic package for post-Lukashenko Belarus to support the reform process,' she 
added. 
 Enquiring minds want to know 
 Pratasevich's arrest after the airplane was diverted to Belarus appears to have been carried out with the help of 
secret agents operating on Greek territory, Kathimerini reported. According to the Greek newspaper, while still at 
Athens International Airport, Pratasevich is said to have informed colleagues via the Telegram messaging 
application that he was approached by an unknown Russian-speaking man who took a snap of him. Reportedly the 
agents also boarded the same flight as Pratasevich and got off in Minsk where the plane was diverted. 
 Analysts across the EU and in world capitals are probably wondering if this incident highlighted any weaknesses in 
the Greek or EU/ Schengen visa issuance system as its become clear intelligence operatives somehow entered the 
Schengen zone and boarded the flight in Athens. 
 Backed by Russia, Lukashenko has managed to successfully crack down on protesters, with Belarus' security 
services remaining loyal to him. 'It is yet unclear what role Russia has played in the incident per se,' Kudzko told 
New Europe. 'So far, we do not have many details. Russia has also had a rather reserved reaction to the incident. 
While supporting the line that Lukashenko acted within the law and followed proper rules to respond to the security 
alert, the Kremlin seems not to be willing to engage too much. There is a bit of a 'wait-and-see' tactic that gives the 
Kremlin time to calibrate its reaction based on the developments inside Belarus but also taking into consideration 
the international reactions,' the GLOBSEC Policy Institute Director said. 
 'But in general, indeed, (Russian President) Vladimir Putin is the main, if not only, remaining supporter of 
Lukashenko who also provides financial, political and other help. Putin knows it very well. He will and is already 
playing a king maker. This is also why the argument that sanctions push Lukashenko closer to Russia do merit a 
serious concern,' Kudzko said. 
 Asked if the Belarus incident would further deteriorate relations between Brussels and Moscow, she said EU-
Russia relations have been sour and have been turning sourer. The situation in Belarus is a contributing factor to 
the deterioration of the relations, but it is not the only one. So far, I don't see a clear strategy proposed by either the 
EU or Russia that would improve the state of the relations between Brussels and Moscow. At least on the EU side, 
Kudzko said, there is an understanding that this state of relations is neither stable nor desirable and there is a 
realization that there should be a strategy that is broader than sanctions. How exactly it will or could look like is not 
well elaborated at this point.

 Family and friends of Russian citizenSofia Sapega - who was detained alongside her boyfriend Roman Protasevich 
on the Ryanair flight which was forcibly diverted to Minsk on Sunday - are saying she was simply in the wrong place 
at the wrong time.  
 Since the pair'sarrests, Western powers have condemned what they called an act of "state piracy" and a "hijacking" 
of an airliner, with the EU ready to heap more sanctions on the Lukashenko government and with European flights 
now avoiding Belarusian airspace altogether over safety concerns. The whole bizarre episode appears to be 
leading toward another major diplomatic "Navalny-styleshowdown" between the West and Russia and its allies, 
given especially Putin's vocal support for embattled Lukashenko over the past months since the disputed election.  
 According to Reuters[3], "Sapega is a student at a university in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. She was flying there 
on Sunday with Protasevich after their holiday in Greece to defend her master's thesis ahead of graduation, 
according to the university."  
 Russia's Foreign Ministry has since confirmed that 23-year old Sapega is a Russian national and is facing charges 
in Belarus along with her boyfriend"in connection with the suspicion of having committed, between August and 
September 2020, offences under several articles of the Belarusian Criminal Code," according to an official 
statement[4].  
 Protasevich was an influential figure in independent and opposition Belarusianmedia reporting, specifically via a 
popular Telegram channel, which helped fuel massive anti-Lukashenko protests since his controversial re-election 
to a sixth term late last summer (which will extend his 27-years in power).

 Sofia Sapega stands accused of assisting Protasevich in helping to organize protests, but also publishing personal 
information of law enforcement personnel to the internet, which is a crime in Belarus.  
 Within a couple days after their detention, videos appeared online of the two "confessing" to a litany of crimes 
which has outragedthe Belarusian opposition as it has the hallmarks of a forcedconfession, given also it's expected 
to come with significant prison sentences.  
 Belarus release a video of Roman Protasevich claiming that he is in good health and being treated lawfully. He 
also acknowledges he was at the protests and is cooperating with the govt. 
 This has all the hallmarks of a forced confession and I can only imagine how fearful he is. https://t.co

 The two are facing charges related to organizing riots which could bring 15 years in prison  
 #Belarus[10] @novaya_gazeta[11] reported that Sofia Sapega might be charged under two articles - plotting riots 
(up to 15 years in prison) and organisation of action that violate public order. 'Riots' in Belarus are organised by 26-
year old bloggers and 23-year-old students. Interesting pic.twitter .com/d9Eajw2ERP[12] ;

 They are expected to be kept in pre-trial detention for up to months, while Belarusian opposition leaderSviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya issued a statement through a spokesman from neighboring Lithuania saying of Sapega that "Sheis 
guilty of being a friend of Roman. And they forced her to confess to 'crimes' she did not commit."  
 Various leaders have weighed in on the pair's fate in particular in the wake of the "confession" videos, with Britain's 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson denouncing Belarus[14]: "The video of Roman Protasevich makes for deeply 
distressing viewing. As a journalist and a passionate believer in freedom of speech I call for his immediate release." 
And he added a moment the EU and multiple Western governments are preparing further sanctions:"Belarus' 
actions will have consequences."  
 * * *  
 But many others are pointing out the glaring hypocrisy and very selective reading of recent history when it comes 
to the unified "outrage" generated with this fresh Belarus saga  
 I spoke today to @krystalball[15] and @esaagar[16] about the extreme, glaring similarities between what Belarus 
did to force the landing of the Ryanair plane and what the US/EU did in 2013 to force the Bolivian President's plane 
to land in order to nab Snowden:https://t.co /VZB84vmTm4[17]

May 26, 2021( The ASPI Strategist: http://www.aspistrategist.org.au/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has once again demonstrated the lengths to which he will go to crack 
down on his opponents. On 23 May, he deployed a MiG-29 fighter jet to force down a commercial flight, which was 
traveling from Athens to Vilnius, shortly before it left Belarusian airspace. The purpose was to apprehend Roman 
Protasevich, the former editor-in-chief of the Belarusian opposition publication and social-media channel Nexta, 
who was arrested after the plane landed in Minsk. 
 Why a regime that is already under US and EU sanctions would go so far as to hijack a plane travelling from one 
EU member state to another is not hard to fathom. Nexta is Lukashenko's public enemy number one. More than just 
a news portal with millions of followers across multiple social-media platforms (especially Telegram), Nexta has 
been the single most important conduit for information in Belarus since the country's fraudulent presidential 
election[1] last August. 
 In addition to reporting on Belarusian security forces' violent crackdown against peaceful demonstrators, Nexta had 
provided daily instructions on when, where and how Belarusians should mobilise during last year's countrywide 
mass protests against Lukashenko's bogus election victory. Its Sunday calls for a national march for freedom 
brought as many as 200,000 people into the streets of Minsk. And all of these demonstrators knew precisely what 
to do, because they were following the playbook published by Protasevich and his colleague, Nexta founder Stepan 
Putilo. 
 Following this unprecedented uprising, Lukashenko's regime panicked, and for good reason. Nexta was collecting 
and sharing information and photos from all over Belarus. Every message, photo and call to action that it published 
went viral, reaching people across the country and around the world. 
 The key to Nexta's power was that it based itself outside of Belarus, in Warsaw. The Lukashenko regime could 
neither turn off its internet connection nor imprison or shoot it, as it was doing with opposition outlets and protesters 
still in Belarus. Lukashenko was doubtless infuriated by the fact that the protests were being guided not so much by 
Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the likely winner of the August election, but by an elusive new-media operator beyond 
Belarus's borders. 
 Since the release in March of a Nexta documentary exposing Lukashenko's ill-gotten riches (similar to a recent 
viral film about Russian President Vladimir Putin published by the now-imprisoned opposition leader Alexei 
Belarus hijacks Western complacency
Navalny[2]), Lukashenko has been prepared to move heaven and earth to take down his 20-something btes noires. 
In his mind, Nexta is the keystone buttressing all of the various fronts of the resistance. 
 Because the Ryanair flight Protasevich was on was much closer to Vilnius than to Minsk, the Lukashenko regime's 
claim that a bomb threat necessitated an emergency landing in the Belarusian capital is not credible. Once it was 
on the ground in Minsk, they made a fleeting show of searching passengers and their luggage before quickly 
apprehending the young dissident and his girlfriend. 
 The detention of Protasevich's girlfriend is a classic method of the KGB (as the Belarusian security service is still 
called), particularly when the intent is to extract confessions. Protasevich is an extremely valuable catch for 
Lukashenko, because (the dictator assumes) he has the contacts of virtually all of Belarus's activists. The day after 
seizing Protasevich, the regime released a video[3] of him admitting to his past participation in the protests. 
 The same tactic has also been used on Tikhanovskaya, whose husband was already in prison. When she was 
abducted after the first August protests in Minsk, she was forced to record a speech calling for an end to the 
uprising, most likely after having seen her husband being threatened with torture. She has since been expelled from 
the country, and because everyone in Belarus is familiar with these methods, no one blames her for remaining 
largely on the sidelines. 
 The hijacking is meant to send a message. To the opposition, Lukashenko wants to say, 'Your days are numbered. 
You are traitors, and we kill traitors.' And to the EU, he has issued a direct challenge: 'We can make fools of you 
whenever it suits us, and you will not hurt us, because you are weak.' 
 Such conclusions are not unwarranted. After all, the Kremlin, whose domestic supporters gloated about the 
hijacking and Protasevich's arrest, poisoned Navalny with a nerve agent and paid almost no price for it. The US, 
UK, EU and others expressed concern and imposed symbolic sanctions, and Russia responded by putting Navalny 
in a labour camp. 
 When the Czech Republic revealed[4] last month that Russia had been behind explosions at a weapons depot that 
killed two Czechs in 2014, the reaction was much the same. In fact, US President Joe Biden's administration has 
just waived sanctions against a company building the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between Russia and Germany. 
Clearly it's money, not principles, that matter. 
 Lukashenko is following Russia's example. The Kremlin has long gloried in embarrassing foreign security services 
that try to protect opposition figures, usually by attacking exiled dissidents right under their noses, as with the March 
2018 attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in the English city of Salisbury. 
 Protasevich had received political asylum in Lithuania. Given that Nexta is based in Poland, it's worth asking if the 
Polish authorities did everything they could—or anything at all—to protect and warn him and his colleagues against 
the dangers they faced. It should have been clear that Protasevich and Putilo were in danger. It's well known that 
Russia and Belarus will target those they consider traitors, even when they're abroad. Now it's well known how far 
they will go for that purpose.

 PARIS - The European Union pledged to deliver at least 100 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to low- and middle-
income countries by year's end, and develop vaccine production capacity in poorer nations, as it wrapped up a two-
day summit in Brussels. 
After being criticized for a slow vaccination start, European leaders say they are steaming ahead on COVID-19 
inoculations, securing 1.8 billion doses to cover the next two years — enough to export to needy countries outside 
the 27-member bloc. The bloc says it's also on track to surpass goals of exporting 100 million doses to developing 
countries. 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, "We are working on an initiative to invest one billion 
euros from Team Europe to develop vaccine manufacturing in Africa — the capacity itself in Africa — it's a specific 
initiative with our African partners. An initiative not only for the production, so to build up the manufacturing 
capacities, but also for skills development, for the management of the supply train of, for example, the necessary 
regulatory framework through the African Medicines Agency."

the end of July. Europe's Medicines Agency is now considering whether to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for 
12- to 15-year-olds. 
Meanwhile, special COVID-19 digital travel passes aim to open up summer travel for EU citizens who are either 
vaccinated, immune from having contracted the virus, or have tested negative for it.  
Together, says analyst Scott Marcus, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based Bruegel economic research group, the 
developments are shaping a more favorable tourism outlook for Europe.

On Monday, EU leaders announced a flight ban and other toughened sanctions against Belarus, after the forced 
landing of a Ryanair plane in Minsk and the arrest of a dissident journalist.  
But speaking from Brussels, French President Emmanuel Macron said progressive sanctions had their limits and 
the EU needed to profoundly redefine its relationship with both Belarus and Russia. 
Member states also discussed the thorny issue of national emissions targets to meet the bloc's overall goal of 
reducing greenhouse gases by 55 percent by 2030, and becoming climate neutral by 2050.

BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union agreed Monday to impose sanctions on Belarus, including banning its 
airlines from using the airspace and airports of the 27-nation bloc, amid fury over the forced diversion of a 
passenger jet to arrest an opposition journalist.
Reacting to what EU leaders called a brazen “hijacking” of the Ryanair jetliner flying from Greece to Lithuania on 
Sunday, they also demanded the immediate release of the journalist, Raman Pratasevich, a key foe of authoritarian 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.
“We won’t tolerate that one can try to play Russian roulette with the lives of innocent civilians,” said EU Council 
chief Charles Michel, who presided over the EU meeting.
A brief video clip of Pratasevich, who ran a popular messaging app that played a key role in helping organize huge 
protests against Lukashenko, was shown on Belarusian state television Monday night, a day after he was removed 
from the Ryanair flight.
Sitting at a table with his hands folded in front of him and speaking rapidly, Pratasevich said he was in satisfactory 
health and said his treatment in custody was “maximally correct and according to law.” He added that he was giving 
evidence to investigators about organizing mass disturbances.
In their unusually swift action in Brussels, the EU leaders also urged all EU-based carriers to avoid flying over 
Belarus, decided to impose sanctions on officials linked to Sunday's flight diversion, and urged the International 
Civil Aviation Organization to start an investigation into what they viewed as an unprecedented move and what 
some said amounted to state terrorism or piracy.
The leaders called on their council “to adopt the necessary measures to ban overflight of EU airspace by Belarusian 
airlines and prevent access to EU airports of flights operated by such airlines.” In addition calling for the release of 
Pratasevich, they also urged authorities in Minsk to free his Russian girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, who was taken off the 
plane with him.
EU leaders agree on Belarus sanctions after plane diversion
The text was endorsed quickly by the leaders who were determined to respond with a “strong reaction” to the 
incident because of the “serious endangering of aviation safety and passengers on board by Belarussian 
authorities,” said an EU official with direct knowledge of the discussions who was not authorized to speak publicly 
about the private talks.
At least one European airline already diverted a flight around Belarus. British Airways flight 3599, which on 
Saturday and Sunday crossed over Belarus, bypassed the country Monday by using Russian airspace instead, 
according to the website Flightradar24.
Ryanair said Belarusian flight controllers told the crew there was a bomb threat against the plane as it was crossing 
through Belarus airspace Sunday and ordered it to land. A Belarusian MiG-29 fighter jet was scrambled to escort 
the plane in a brazen show of force by Lukashenko, who has ruled the country with an iron fist for over a quarter-
century.
Belarus authorities then arrested the 26-year-old activist, journalist and prominent Lukashenko critic. Pratasevich 
and his Russian girlfriend were taken off the plane shortly after it landed, and authorities haven't said where they're 
being held. Ryanair Flight FR4978, which began in Athens, Greece, was eventually allowed to continue on to 
Vilnius, Lithuania.
“This is an attack on democracy,” said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the executive European Commission. 
“This is an attack on freedom of expression. And this is an attack on European sovereignty. And this outrageous 
behavior needs a strong answer.”
Von der Leyen added that a \u20ac3 billion EU investment and economic package for Belarus will remain on hold 
until Belarus “turns democratic.”
U.S. President Joe Biden said late Monday that he asked his team to develop appropriate options to hold 
accountable those responsible, in close coordination with the European Union, other allies and partners, and 
international organizations.
“This outrageous incident and the video Mr. Pratasevich appears to have made under duress are shameful assaults 
on both political dissent and the freedom of the press. The United States joins countries around the world in calling 
for his release, as well as for the release of the hundreds of political prisoners who are being unjustly detained by 
the Lukashenka regime,” Biden's statement said.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said earlier that National Security adviser Jake Sullivan raised the issue in 
a call with the secretary of the Russian Security Council.
Two U.S. senators urged the Biden administration to prohibit U.S. airlines from entering Belarus airspace because 
of the incident. “We must protect innocent passengers from despotic regimes and stand in solidarity with dissidents 
who are being targeted,” Sens. Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, and Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, said 
in a joint statement.
EU leaders were particularly forceful in their condemnation of the arrest and the move against the plane, which was 
flying between two of the bloc’s member nations and was being operated by an airline based in Ireland, also a 
member.
EU leaders have tried to bring Belarus closer to the bloc — to encourage democratic reforms and reduce the 
influence of Russia — but have failed so far.
British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he instructed the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority “to request airlines 
avoid Belarusian airspace in order to keep passengers safe.” He added he was suspending the permit allowing 
Belavia to operate in the U.K.
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ordered officials to move to cut the air link with Belarus and ban Ukrainian 
flights via the neighbor's airspace.
EU leaders agree on Belarus sanctions after plane diversion
The U.S. and the EU have imposed sanctions on top Belarusian officials amid months of protests, which were 
triggered by Lukashenko’s reelection to a sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition rejected as rigged. 
More than 34,000 people have been arrested in Belarus since then, and thousands beaten.
The Belarusian Foreign Ministry bristled at what it described as “belligerent” EU statements, insisting Minsk acted 
“in full conformity with international rules.”
It ordered all Latvian diplomats out of the country after the Belarusian flag was replaced Monday with the white-and-
red one used by the opposition at the world ice hockey championship in Riga, Latvia. The event was moved from 
Minsk amid the international outcry over the crackdown.
Lufthansa said a flight from Minsk to Frankfurt with 51 people aboard was delayed Monday following a “security 
warning.” It was allowed to depart after the plane, passengers and cargo were searched.
On Sunday, flight tracker sites indicated the Ryanair flight was about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Lithuanian 
border when it was diverted. There were conflicting reports on what exactly happened.
Belarusian transport ministry official Artem Sikorsky said the Minsk airport had received an email about the bomb 
threat from the Palestinian militant group Hamas.
But Ryanair said in a statement that Belarusian air traffic control instructed the plane to divert to the capital. The 
plane was searched, and no bomb was found. Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary described the move as “a case of 
state-sponsored hijacking \u2026 state-sponsored piracy.”
Passengers described Pratasevich's shock when he realized the plane was going to Minsk.
“He freaked out when the pilot said the plane is diverted to Minsk. He said there’s death penalty awaiting him there,” 
passenger Marius Rutkauskas said after the plane finally arrived in Vilnius.
Pratasevich was a co-founder of the Telegram messaging app’s Nexta channel, which played a prominent role in 
helping organize the anti-Lukashenko protests. Nearly 2 million Belarusians in the nation of 9.3 million people have 
followed the channel. Belarus authorities have labeled the channel “extremist” and charged Pratasevich in absentia 
of inciting mass riots and fanning social hatred. He could face 15 years in prison.
Amid the international outrage, Moscow quickly offered a helping hand to its ally.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the episode needs to be investigated — but that it couldn’t be rushed. 
Moscow and Minsk have close political, economic and military ties, and Lukashenko has relied on Russian support 
amid Western sanctions.

 US President Joe Biden slammed Belarus on Monday for the "outrageous" act of forcing a flight from Greece to 
Lithuania to land in Minsk where a dissident journalist onboard was arrested. 
"This outrageous incident and the video Mr. Pratasevich appears to have made under duress are shameful assaults 
on both political dissent and the freedom of the press," Biden said, using an alternative spelling of the activist's 
name, after Belarusian TV broadcast video of Roman Protasevich "confessing" to charges of organizing mass 
unrest. 
"I welcome the news that the European Union has called for targeted economic sanctions and other measures, and 
have asked my team to develop appropriate options to hold accountable those responsible," Biden added in his 
statement. 
Belarus's strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko sparked international outrage by dispatching a fighter jet 
Sunday to intercept the Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius carrying Protasevich, 26, and his girlfriend Sofia 
Sapega. 
EU leaders agreed Monday to cut air links with Belarus, and the bloc said it would adopt further "targeted economic 
sanctions" against Belarusian authorities to add to the 88 regime figures and seven companies already on a 
blacklist over a crackdown on opposition. 
The TV footage showed Protasevich -- who could face 15 years in jail -- with dark markings on his forehead, saying 
he was being treated "according to the law." 
"The United States joins countries around the world in calling for his release, as well as for the release of the 
hundreds of political prisoners who are being unjustly detained by the Lukashenka regime," Biden said. 
 The White House added that National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan had spoken to exiled opposition leader 
Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, to convey "the United States' strong support for the demands of the Belarusian people for 
democracy, human rights, and fundamental freedoms."

Aviation officials say the interception of Ryanair aircraft could threaten security, upset airline years, government 
trust.
The authorities there arrested a prominent journalist and opposition activist, before allowing the plane to continue its 
journey. The incident has created an international uproar and has raised questions over the legality of the 
grounding of the aircraft and the implications for the airline industry.
The European Union, the UK, Ukraine and Lithuania banned their airlines from flying over Belarus. According to 
aircraft tracking firm Flightradar24, about 3,000 flights pass through Belarus each week.
The move to escape the country adds to Ukraine's earlier sanctions already Malaysia Airlines downed a plane in 
2014. While not presenting a major detour for most airlines, rerouting primarily adds time and extra fuel expense to 
flights between Europe and Southeast Asia.
For example, a British Airways flight from London to Kuala Lumpur will fly directly over eastern Ukraine, without any 
restrictions. The flight is using Belarus airspace instead, before turning south towards the Malaysian capital. With 
the new restrictions, the airline will now be required to fly northward, turning south over Russia.
On Monday, Belarusian transport officials said that Gaza's governing terrorist group, Hamas, had sent an email to 
Minsk National Airport stating that a bomb on RyanAir's flight until Israel ended hostilities in the Gaza Strip The 
explosion would occur, a claim which was rejected by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. As "completely 
impossible". Gaza officials did not respond to a request for comment.
Aviation experts say that if Belarus threatened the bomb and intercepted the jetliner to catch the disgruntled, it 
would undermine the Chicago Convention signed in 1944, which in most cases prohibited the use of military force 
against civilian aircraft. Does. Industry officials and aviation-safety officials said they do not recall a recent example 
involving a commercial jetliner.
"We're in uncharted territory," said Conor Nolan, president of the Board of Governors of the Virginia-based Flight 
Safety Foundation, which advocates for air safety. "If we lose confidence in the ability to fly over the states safely, it 
will significantly harm confidence in international commercial aviation." He and others demanded a comprehensive 
investigation into what happened.
Belarus flight diversion could threaten international security
Bomb threats are one of the toughest challenges a commercial airline pilot faces, and airlines and aviation 
regulators have spent years devising protocols to handle them. Procedures, which involve authenticating and 
communicating a threat and what action to take once someone is considered genuine, are largely kept from public 
view, so that potential bad actors can be exploited or avoided. To be discouraged.
But officials say they are built on trust between the cockpit crew and the officers. If the RyanAir diversion is shown 
as a ploy, then that belief could be destroyed not only in Belarus, but around the world.
The International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Association said in a statement, "This unprecedented act of unlawful 
interference will potentially eliminate all assumptions about the safest response to bomb threats on flight and 
interception."
Pilots say a fundamental principle of bomb-threat response is to land the aircraft at the nearest safe airport. 
According to flight-tracking data, in the case of the RyanAir diversion, the jetliner overturned and moved towards the 
capital of Belarus, Minsk, when it was already close to the border with Lithuania. According to Eurocontrol, which 
manages air-traffic controllers across Europe, Lithuania would have had an operative airport to reach Vilnius, the 
original destination of the flight.
Ryanair's cockpit crew had little room to maneuver, pilots and aviation industry officials said. In the wake of the 
September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on planes that crashed in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania, 
governments have increasingly felt that they may believe the jetliner is a direct threat if it fails to respond to 
instructions, and They can order military action to prevent disaster.
Mr. Nolan said, "Come on, don't be under any illusion, if a fighter jet from your wingtip is clearly indicating 
directions, the pilot of a commercial air transport aircraft has no choice but to follow those instructions." is."
The Belarus interception is not without some commonalities. Russia's government has dismissed criticism against 
its ally Belarus, citing a 2013 incident in which Bolivia's presidential aircraft, suspected of carrying former US 
intelligence officer Edward Snowden, en route back to Bolivia from Moscow France and Portugal were prevented 
from entering the airspace. It was forced to land in Vienna, where the aircraft was searched. A government aircraft 
was involved in that incident, however, not a commercial airline.
In 1985, the US intercepted an Egyptian passenger jet carrying four people who had conspired to hijack an Italian 
cruise ship. The flight, which requested permission to land in Tunis, Tunisia, was directed by US military jets to 
divert to a naval air station in Sicily, where the men were arrested.

The international community must act in concert against Belarus' weekend gambit to arrest a dissident journalist by 
forcing the passenger plane he was on to land in Minsk, says Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana 
Tikhanovskaya.
Now is the time to discuss joint steps "to bring the perpetrators to justice," wrote Tikhanovskaya, who lives in exile 
in Lithuania, on the Telegram messaging app on Tuesday.
The US should launch an investigation into the forced landing of the Ryanair flight and journalist Roman 
Protasevich's detention, she said after a phone call with US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.
"All of this is a result of the regime's impunity and the lack of a decisive response from the international community," 
she added, noting that she thinks Protasevich is being tortured.
In videos circulated in Belarus, Protasevich said he wanted to make further confessions about organizing mass 
unrest - statements the opposition said were made under duress, pointing to signs of beating.
Belarusian authorities alerted the crew of a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius of a possible security threat on 
Sunday and directed it to land at an airport near Minsk; long-time President Alexander Lukashenko also ordered a 
MiG-29 fighter jet to be scrambled to accompany the plane, according to the state news agency.
Authorities in Minsk then arrested Protasevich and his girlfriend, who was also on board, sparking international 
condemnation, sanctions and the sealing-off of Belarusian airspace by the EU.
Air France and Finnair are the latest airlines to announce that they would be avoiding flying over Belarus for the 
time being.

Wizz Air (W6, Budapest) has filed a complaint at the General Court of the European Union against the European 
Commission approvals for Romanian state aid granted to state-owned flag carrier Tarom (RO, Bucharest Otopeni) 
and privately-held Blue Air (Romania) (0B, Bucharest Otopeni). Tarom received EUR19.3 million euros (USD23 
million) in October 2020 to compensate for losses caused by Covid-19 travel restrictions, after a nod from Brussels, 
in addition to a EUR36.7 million (USD44.8 million) rescue loan approved in February 2020, shortly before the mass 
outbreak. Blue Air also received Covid-related aid of EUR62 million (USD75.7 million). Hungary-based budget 
carrier Wizz submitted its objection against Tarom's EC-approved state aid in January 2021, and against Blue Air's 
last month, the Romanian news site Economica.net reported on May 20. Economica was issuing its report, it said, 
the day after Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) notched up its first legal victories against state aid provided to European flag 
carriers, to KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and TAP Air Portugal. Oana Petrescu, chief executive of Blue Air, told the 
news portal that "we have no cause for concern." 
She had been aware of the challenge Wizz Air had lodged but emphasised that her carrier had complied with all the 
necessary current requirements related to state aid in the European Union. "Last month, I also submitted an audit 
report and restructuring plan requested by the commission, documents that confirm the premises on the basis of 
which we received the state-guaranteed loan in October 2020," she said. And Wizz Air has itself benefitted, she 
added, in April 2020, from a GBP300 million pound bailout via the Bank of England's Covid Corporate Financing 
Facility (CCFF) - a controversial decision in the aviation sector at the time as struggling Virgin Atlantic (VS, London 
Heathrow) received nothing. Wizz Air CEO József Váradi has been telling the international media over the last year 
that many European airlines which had been mismanaged before the Covid-19 crisis and were already short of 
cash were now asking for state assistance, agreeing with Ryanair that such bailouts would only serve to prolong the 
existence of inefficient airlines. Wizz Air is the market leader in Romania, operating routes from nine airports in the 
country, according to the ch-aviation capacities module, from Bucharest Otopeni, Cluj-Napoca, Iasi, Timisoara, 
Sibiu, Craiova, Bacau, Suceava, and Tirgu Mures. On May 21, the low-cost carrier told local media that it would 
resume 27 more routes from these airports to destinations in nine countries by June 6 (in France, Germany, Italy, 
Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK). Tarom and Wizz Air had not responded to ch-
aviation's request for comment at the time of going to press.

 Belarus's opposition called Tuesday for more pressure on strongman Alexander Lukashenko as Europe moved to 
cut air links with the country over the extraordinary diversion of an airliner and arrest of a dissident on board. 
The forced landing of the Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius on Sunday and arrest of opposition journalist Roman 
Protasevich sparked an international outcry and calls for tough action against the longtime Belarusian leader. 
European Union leaders took a first step on Monday, agreeing at a summit to ban Belarusian airlines from the bloc 
and calling on EU-based carriers not to fly over its airspace.

Exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya urged the international community to go further in isolating the 
regime. 
In a call with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Tikhanovskaya asked the United States to "isolate the 
regime and pressure it through sanctions", she said on Twitter. 
In a separate post on her Telegram channel, Tikhanovskaya, who lives in Lithuania, said she asked for the 
opposition to be invited to next month's G7 summit in Britain. 
"The situation with the hijacking of the plane cannot be considered separately from other repressions and flagrant 
violations of human rights in Belarus," she said.

 EU leaders on Monday warned they would adopt further "targeted economic sanctions" against the Belarusian 
authorities to add to the 88 regime figures and seven companies already on a blacklist over a crackdown on 
opposition. 
The UN rights office also demanded the immediate release of Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, who was 
also arrested.

Lukashenko and his allies are already under a series of Western sanctions over a brutal crackdown on opposition 
protests that followed his disputed re-election to a sixth term in August last year. 
Protasevich, 26, was a co-founder of the Nexta Telegram channel, which helped organise the protests that were the 
biggest challenge to Lukashenko's 26-year rule. 
He had been living between Poland and Lithuania.

Belarus Opposition Calls For More Pressure After Plane Arrest
Belarusian state television late on Monday broadcast a 30-second video of Protasevich confirming that he was in 
prison in Minsk and "confessing" to charges of organising mass unrest. 
The footage showed Protasevich -- who could face 15 years in jail -- with dark markings visible on his forehead, 
saying he was being treated "according to the law". 
His allies say the video was made under pressure from authorities, with Tikhanovskaya saying there was "no doubt 
that Roman was being tortured in prison". 
US President Joe Biden slammed the forced diversion of the plane and arrest of Protasevich as "a direct affront to 
international norms" and said the video appeared to have been made "under duress".

"I welcome the news that the European Union has called for targeted economic sanctions and other measures, and 
have asked my team to develop appropriate options to hold accountable those responsible," Biden said in a White 
House statement. 
Protasevich's father Dmitry Protasevich told AFP in Poland that he had not been able to contact his son since 
Saturday and that he did not appear himself in the video. 
"It's clear that he was physically harmed because you can see signs of a beating on his face," he said. 
"He would never speak like that. Those were not his words... he was reading something out that he was told to read 
out." 
Minsk said it had reacted to secure the flight after receiving a bomb threat, supposedly from Palestinian Islamist 
group Hamas, but European leaders dismissed the claim as implausible. 
Lukashenko -- who scrambled a Belarusian fighter jet to intercept the Ryanair flight -- has remained defiant in the 
face of sanctions with help from his main backer Russia. 
Moscow has dismissed the outrage in the West, saying Belarus was acting reasonably and within the law when the 
plane was diverted. 
Air France, Finnair and Singapore Airlines on Tuesday became the latest carriers to suspend flights over Belarus, 
following Scandinavian airline SAS, Germany's Lufthansa and Latvia-based regional airline Air Baltic. 
Neighbouring Ukraine has also said it would halt direct flights between the two countries and over Belarus. 
The EU has demanded a probe by the International Civil Aviation Organization, a UN agency, which is to meet on 
Thursday. 
Last year's protests gripped the country for months, with tens of thousands taking to the streets to denounce 
Lukashenko's rule. 
The 66-year-old leader has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for over two decades and responded to the 
demonstrations with a violent crackdown, detaining thousands, many of whom reported torture and abuse in 
custody. 
Many protest leaders -- including Tikhanovskaya who claimed victory in the August vote -- fled the country and the 
demonstrations have dwindled. 
Authorities have in recent months imposed a series of jail sentences on organisers, participants and journalists over 
the protests.

 Air France, Finnair and Singapore Airlines became the latest carriers to suspend flights over Belarus on Tuesday 
after Minsk forced a jet to land to arrest a dissident. 
The announcements came a day after European Union leaders urged EU-based airlines to avoid Belarusian 
airspace and banned the country's airlines from the 27-nation block. 
Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko sparked international outrage by dispatching a fighter jet Sunday to 
intercept a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius carrying wanted reporter Roman Protasevich, 26, and his girlfriend 
Sofia Sapega. 
Air France said in a statement it had "taken note" of the conclusions of Monday's EU summit and had suspended 
flights over Belarus "until further notice". 
Planes already in the air will have their flight plans modified, the French company said.

Singapore Airlines was also rerouting flights "that are bound for Europe to avoid the Belarusian airspace" and would 
continue to "closely monitor the situation", a spokesperson said. 
"The safety of our customers and crew is our top priority," a spokesperson told AFP. 
 Finnair said the next flight that will be affected by its decision to reroute planes is one that was heading to the 
Turkish coastal town of Gazipasa on Wednesday. 
Scandinavian airline SAS, Germany's Lufthansa and Latvia-based regional airline Air Baltic made similar 
announcements on Monday. 
Britain also issued instructions for British aircraft to avoid Belarusian airspace while Ukraine decided to halt direct 
flights between the two countries and over Belarus. 
Western leaders have accused Belarusian authorities of essentially hijacking a European plane, while Minsk 
claimed it had reacted to secure the flight after receiving a bomb threat.

The international community must act in concert to prevent a repeat of Belarus' weekend gambit - in which it

on Tuesday that he has been receiving death threats since Protasevich's arrest.
"They write to me that it's our turn next, that we won't be kidnapped to Belarus but shot in Warsaw," he told the 
Rzeczpospolita.
Nexta, the Belarusian opposition's main source of information during massive protests against long-time ruler 
Alexander Lukashenko, is based in Warsaw. Protasevich left Nexta at the end of 2020.

Belarusian authorities alerted the crew of a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius of a possible security threat on

Authorities in Minsk then detained Protasevich and his girlfriend, who was also on board, sparking international 
condemnation as well as a package of measures by the EU that include sanctions, the sealing-off of Belrusian 
airspace and a landing ban on its airlines.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed sanctions the EU imposed on Belarus following the forced 
landing of a Ryanair flight.
"This is a state hijacking and demonstrates how the regime in Minsk attacks basic democratic rights and cracks 
down on freedom of expression and independent media," he said, adding that an urgent international investigation 
was needed.
NATO members will meet later on Tuesday to discuss the issue.
Lufthansa, Air France and Finnair are the latest airlines to announce that they would be avoiding flying over Belarus 
for the time being.
Some 339 flights pass over Belarus per day to and from Europe, according to aviation authority Eurocontrol.
Belarus' state-owned airline said on Tuesday that it had suspended flights to London and Paris until the end of 
October in response to a landing ban by those countries, saying it regretted the situation.

 Belarus's regime was increasingly isolated Tuesday as Europe cut air links and calls grew for more action over its 
diversion of an airliner and arrest of a dissident on board. 
After weathering a wave of protests and Western sanctions last year, President Alexander Lukashenko was facing 
extraordinary new pressure over Sunday's rerouting of the Ryanair flight to Minsk and arrest of opposition journalist 
Roman Protasevich. 
More Western leaders joined calls demanding Protasevich's release, after the European Union agreed at a summit 
on Monday to ban Belarusian airlines from the bloc and called on EU-based carriers not to fly over its airspace.

States to take action in a call with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. 
Speaking to reporters in Vilnius where she lives in exile after a disputed election last August, Tikhanovskaya called 
for "comprehensive" international measures to force the regime to give up power. 
"This is the time to act," she said.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined calls for Protasevich to be released, warning: "Belarus's actions will 
have consequences." 
The UN rights office also demanded the immediate release of Protasevich and his Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega, 
who was also arrested after the Athens-to-Vilnius flight landed in Minsk. 
EU leaders on Monday warned they would adopt further "targeted economic sanctions" against the Belarusian 
authorities to add to the 88 regime figures and seven companies on a blacklist. 
Belarus Isolation Grows As Air Links Cut Over Diverted Plane
Lukashenko and his allies are already under a series of Western sanctions over a brutal crackdown on opposition 
protests that followed his disputed re-election to a sixth term last August.

Protasevich, 26, was a co-founder of the Nexta Telegram channel, which helped organise the protests that were the 
biggest challenge to Lukashenko's long rule. 
He had been living between Poland and Lithuania. 
Belarusian state television late on Monday broadcast a 30-second video of Protasevich confirming that he was in 
prison in Minsk and "confessing" to charges of organising mass unrest.

The footage showed Protasevich -- who could face 15 years in jail -- with dark markings visible on his forehead, 
saying he was being treated "according to the law". 
US President Joe Biden said the video appeared to have been made "under duress". He welcomed the EU moves 
and said Washington was looking at "appropriate options to hold accountable those responsible." 
Protasevich's father Dmitry Protasevich told AFP in Poland that it looked like his son had been harmed and was 
under pressure. 
"He would never speak like that. Those were not his words... he was reading something out that he was told to read 
out," he said. 
Minsk said it had reacted to secure the flight after receiving a bomb threat, supposedly from Palestinian Islamist 
group Hamas, but European leaders dismissed the claim as implausible. 
The transport ministry on Tuesday released a transcript of the call between Minsk air traffic control and the Ryanair 
flight, in which the crew was told "you have a bomb a board" and urged it to land in Minsk. 
Lukashenko -- who scrambled a Belarusian fighter jet to intercept the Ryanair flight -- has remained defiant in the 
face of sanctions with help from his main backer Russia. 
Moscow has dismissed the outrage in the West, saying Belarus was acting reasonably and within the law when the 
plane was diverted. 
Last year's protests gripped the country for months, with tens of thousands taking to the streets to denounce 
Lukashenko's regime. 
The 66-year-old leader has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for over two decades and responded to the 
demonstrations with a violent crackdown, detaining thousands, many of whom reported torture and abuse in 
custody. 
Many protest leaders -- including Tikhanovskaya who claimed victory in the August vote -- fled the country and the 
demonstrations have dwindled. 
Authorities have imposed a series of jail sentences on organisers, participants and journalists over the protests, 
including seven activists who were sentenced Tuesday to jail terms of four to seven years. 
On the streets of Minsk, many opposition supporters welcomed the flight bans, saying Belarusians were largely 
unable to travel anyway and more pressure was needed for change. 
"An ordinary Belarusian will not suffer from this. Ordinary Belarusians cannot afford flights," said Valentina, a retired 
teacher who like others who spoke to AFP was afraid to give her last name. 
Severin, a blogger, said such moves were needed to force the regime to accept the results of last August's vote.

Eagerly awaited Biden-Putin summit set for June 16 in Geneva

US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet on June 16 in Geneva for an eagerly 
anticipated face-to-face session that comes at a time of worsening tensions between the rival powers.
The White House and the Kremlin announced the date on Tuesday. The idea was proposed by Biden in a phone 
call to Putin in April, but until now the Kremlin has been cagey about whether or not Putin would accept the 
invitation.
The Kremlin said the two would discuss bilateral relations, strategic stability, settlement of regional conflicts and 
anti-pandemic cooperation, Russia's TASS news agency reported.
"The leaders will discuss the full range of pressing issues, as we seek to restore predictability and stability to the 
US-Russia relationship," read a White House statement.
For Biden, the meeting in the Swiss city will likely come at the end of his first overseas trip in office. He is already 
scheduled to attend the G7 summit in Cornwall, England from June 11 to 13, then travel to the NATO summit in 
Brussels on June 14.
Biden has raised the stakes in US relations with Putin, who has been in power more than two decades, since taking 
office in January.
US-Russia ties have nose-dived over Washington's allegations of election interference and cyberattacks, the 
treatment of jailed Russian dissident Alexei Navalny and the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
The two sides have imposed a wave of sanctions and counter-sanctions and expelled each other's diplomats.
Eagerly awaited Biden-Putin summit set for June 16 in Geneva
The recent forced diversion of a Ryanair flight by Belarus - whose longtime authoritarian leader Alexander 
Lukashenko is backed by Putin - has provided the latest point of contention.
During an interview in March, Biden responded affirmatively when asked if he thought Putin was "a killer" - an 
answer that outraged the Kremlin - and warned Putin would "pay a price" for the election interference.
"President Biden is meeting with Vladimir Putin because of our countries' differences, not in spite of them. It's an 
opportunity to raise concerns where we have them and to move toward a more stable and predictable relationship," 
said White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki.
"We're not suggesting that at the end of this it's going to be easy breezy from here," she said.
In recent days, US and Russian officials have been laying the groundwork for the summit.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov met in Iceland last week, while 
US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev met in 
Geneva on Monday.

Fears grow that detained Belarusian journalist subject to torture
Fears grow that detained Belarusian journalist subject to torture

Fears grew on Tuesday that the Belarusian dissident journalist Roman Protasevich, who was detained in Minsk 
after his plane was forcibly rerouted, has been subject to torture while in custody.
Natalia Protasevich, the mother of the journalist, said there was clear evidence that her son had been subject to 
violence, referring to footage released a day earlier from the Minsk pre-trial detention centre where he is being held.
He was arrested on Sunday after Belarusian authorities alerted the crew of his Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius 
of a possible security threat and directed it to land at an airport near Minsk.
President Alexander Lukashenko also ordered a MiG-29 fighter jet to be scrambled to accompany the plane, 
according to the state news agency.
Authorities in Minsk then detained Protasevich and his girlfriend, who was also on board.
"I am not a surgeon, but it is certain that they hit his nose and may have broken it," Protasevich's mother said of the 
video that was circulated by the authorities.
She also said her son's left cheek was swollen and sagging. "Even under the make-up, you can see a yellowish 
tinge - probably bruises were covered with powder."
She said she also saw signs of strangulation on the neck of her son. "From the looks of it, they choked him to beat 
evidence out of him."
In the video, Protasevich, 26, said he was being treated in accordance with the law and confessed to having 
organized riots.
Fears grow that detained Belarusian journalist subject to torture
Her son was forced to make the statement, Protasevich said. "He either read it off the page or was forced to 
memorize it."
Her son is a very strong person, said Protasevich, who lives with her husband in exile in Poland. However, she said 
she feared the authorities might abuse his girlfriend in order to break her son.
Her fears were echoed by opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who said the international community must 
act in concert to prevent a repeat of Belarus' weekend gambit.
Now is the time to discuss joint steps "to bring the perpetrators to justice," Tikhanovskaya, who lives in exile in 
Lithuania, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.
The US should launch an investigation into the flight's forced landing and Protasevich's detention, she said after a 
phone call with US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.
"All of this is a result of the regime's impunity and the lack of a decisive response from the international community," 
she added.
On Tuesday, Russian newspaper RBK said Sofia Sapega, Protasevich's girlfriend, had been remanded in custody 
for two months, citing a lawyer.
Belarusian blogger Stepan Putilo, the founder of the Nexta portal on Telegram along with Protasevich, told a Polish 
newspaper that he has been receiving death threats since Protasevich's arrest.
"They write to me that it's our turn next, that we won't be kidnapped to Belarus but shot in Warsaw," he told the 
Rzeczpospolita.
Nexta, the Belarusian opposition's main source of information during massive protests against long-time ruler 
Lukashenko, is based in Warsaw. Protasevich left Nexta at the end of 2020.
On Monday, the EU agreed to a package of sanctions, including the sealing-off of Belarusian airspace and a 
landing ban on its airlines in response to the forced landing of the plane.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed the sanctions.
"This is a state hijacking and demonstrates how the regime in Minsk attacks basic democratic rights and cracks 
down on freedom of expression and independent media," he said, adding that an urgent international investigation 
was needed.
Lufthansa, Air France and Finnair are the latest airlines to announce that they would be avoiding flying over Belarus 
for the time being.
Some 339 flights pass over Belarus per day to and from Europe, according to aviation authority Eurocontrol.
Belarus' state-owned airline said on Tuesday that it had suspended flights to London and Paris until the end of 
October in response to a landing ban by those countries, saying it regretted the situation.
Lukashenko was already an international pariah after disputed elections last year and a violent clampdown on 
widespread protests.

Latvia And Hockey Body Spar Over Belarus Opposition Flag

May 25, 2021( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ice hockey's global governing body on Tuesday protested against Latvia's decision to put up the Belarusian 
opposition's flag at this year's world championship in Riga, stressing that it was an apolitical sports organisation. 
Latvian officials had swapped out the Belarus national flag for the white-red-white flag of the opposition in a show of 
solidarity with journalist Roman Protasevich, who was arrested Sunday after Belarus forced the Ryanair flight he 
was on to land in Minsk. 
The flag replacement Monday led Belarus to expel the entire staff of Latvia's embassy, including the ambassador. 
Latvia then responded with the reciprocal expulsion of Belarusian diplomats. 
Riga was named the sole host of the 2021 ice hockey world championship, which started on May 21, after Belarus 
was excluded from its role as co-host over "security concerns". 
The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) "does not agree with the actions taken yesterday by the mayor of 
Riga and the Latvian foreign minister to use the flag of a participating country in the 2021 IIHF Ice Hockey World 
Championship for a political message," the Swiss-based governing body said in a statement. 
"The actions of the Belarus government are separate from the players who are competing under the Belarus flag at 
this tournament. The players have been welcomed to Latvia as guests and should not have to see their flag 
removed without their consent from the public display of the 16 participating countries," it added.

The IIHF said it has asked the mayor of Riga to take down the governing body's flag from the same area so that the 
organisation "is removed from any association with the political statements". 
 It added that it hoped the mayor's office would reconsider its decision, but Riga mayor Martins Stakis said he would 
not take down the opposition flag. 
"I have made my choice, and we will proceed with removing the IIHF flags from the public space in Riga," Stakis 
said on his Facebook page on Tuesday. 
"We cannot forget that just a few hundred kilometres away an EU aircraft is hijacked and people are being tortured 
and killed," he added. 
"The regime committing these crimes is behaving like a bandit on the national and now also on an international 
level." 
Latvia And Hockey Body Spar Over Belarus Opposition Flag
Belarus's long-serving President Alexander Lukashenko and his allies are already under European Union and US 
sanctions for his crackdown on protests that erupted after a presidential vote last August. 
During months of demonstrations that have since faded, opponents demanded the resignation of the 66-year-old 
president, saying the election was rigged.

EU to seal off skies to Belarusian air traffic after flight diversion
EU to seal off skies to Belarusian air traffic after flight diversion

The European Union is readying to seal off its airspace and airports to Belarusian airlines after a passenger flight 
between two EU states was forcibly diverted to Minsk in order to detain a dissident Belarusian journalist.
"This outrageous behaviour needs a strong answer," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, 
slamming the "state hijacking" as an attack on democracy, freedom of expression and European sovereignty.
In a joint statement signed off at a summit in Brussels, the bloc's leaders instructed relevant officials to "adopt 
necessary measures to ban overflight of EU airspace by Belarusian airlines and prevent access to EU airports."
The 27 premiers also urged all EU-based carriers to avoid flying over Belarusian territory, which von der Leyen said 
was no longer safe.
Once implemented, state airline Belavia will not be able to fly to a host of cities, including to Berlin, Paris and 
Brussels. It will also likely have to re-route its flights to, for example, Tunisia, as the most direct flight path crosses 
EU air space.
The member states also demanded the immediate release of opposition journalist Roman Protasevich and his 
partner Sofia Sapega.
Both were on board a Ryanair flight between EU countries Greece and Lithuania on Sunday that was rerouted to 
the Belarusian capital shortly before it reached Vilnius due to an alleged bomb threat. No bomb was found.
The 26-year-old journalist had been taken into pre-trial detention, Belarusian authorities confirmed on Monday.
EU to seal off skies to Belarusian air traffic after flight diversion
The incident leapt onto the summit's agenda at the last minute and soured relations with the authoritarian 
government even further.
The EU also decided to sanction Belarusian individuals involved in the plane's diversion and economic actors that 
finance the country's regime, von der Leyen said. A list of individuals and companies will be drawn up at a later 
stage.
The punitive measures were agreed on relatively quickly after leaders headed into their meeting on Monday 
evening, with multiple premiers having publicly voiced their support for sanctions throughout the day.
Lithuania's President Gitanas Nauseda called the forced landing "abhorrent." Similarly, Irish Prime Minister Micheal 
Martin called the diversion "appalling, reckless and unacceptable."
The incident also has implications for the country's EU funds. A 3-billion-euro (3.7-billion-dollar) EU investment and 
economic package planned for Belarus is frozen until the country "turns democratic," von der Leyen said.
The EU member states also called on the International Civil Aviation Organization to "urgently investigate" the 
incident.
US President Joe Biden welcomed the EU calls for "targeted economic sanctions and other measures" and said he 
had asked his team to work on options to hold those responsible accountable in close coordination with the EU and 
other partners. He also called for an international investigation to ascertain the facts of the case.
Prior to the EU leaders' meeting, Belarus said it is open to an international investigation into the forced landing. 
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Anatoly Glass rejected EU criticism, and said that Minsk had fully complied with 
international regulations.
But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said all of Minsk's explanations for the manoeuvre so far had been "totally 
unbelievable."
Belarus has seen months of protests - matched by a dogged crackdown - after authoritarian President Alexander 
Lukashenko claimed victory in an election in August last year that the opposition sees as rigged.
Since the poll, which the EU maintains was neither free nor fair, the bloc has imposed sanctions over several 
rounds for human rights breaches. The total of targeted individuals is currently 88, including Lukashenko himself, 
plus seven entities.
The 66-year-old has led Belarus - a former Soviet republic in Eastern Europe bordering EU states Poland, Lithuania 
and Latvia - for more than a quarter of a century, tolerating little dissent.
Minsk has grown closer to Moscow in recent years. But Lukashenko has also maintained relations with EU partners 
in his almost 27 years in power.

EU leaders was last night preparing to punish the Minsk regime for intercepting a Ryanair flight as the UK warned 
airlines to avoid Belarus airspace and banned the eastern European country's national carrier from its airports.
The White House joined condemnation of Sunday's interception of the Ryanair flight and detention of Roman 
Protasevich, a leading opposition activist. "We are outraged," said press secretary Jen Psaki, calling the flight 
diversion a brazen affront to international peace and security by the regime in Belarus.
"We demand an immediate, international, transparent and credible investigation of this incident," she said, adding 
that the US had directly conveyed its concerns to Russia as well as Belarus due to the two countries' close 
relationship.
Ryanair branded the rerouting of its flight from Athens to Vilnius an "act of aviation piracy" while several European 
airlines including Latvia's airBaltic and Scandinavia's SAS said that they would stop using Belarusian air space.
Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, also instructed his government to ban all direct flights from Ukraine to 
Belarus and to prohibit any flights from
Ukraine over its neighbour's airspace.
Belarus faces threat of western sanctions after 'aviation piracy' ? 'Outraged' US demands inquiry ? Russia 
warned of concerns ? Merkel calls for captive's relea....
The UK, EU and US are exploring a range of possible sanctions, officials said, as UK foreign secretary Dominic 
Raab described the forced landing and detention of Protasevich as "danger to civilian flights everywhere".
German chancellor Angela Merkel demanded the immediate release of Protasevich and his partner, Sofia Sapega. 
"We will demand this, and at the same time discuss what measures we can take against Belarus," she said before a 
European Council meeting.
One EU idea being explored is to target the business interests of oligarchs who are financiers of the Belarus 
regime, EU diplomats said. This would hurt Lukashenko and his allies while avoiding more sweeping economic 
sanctions that could harm ordinary Belarusians.
Other sanctions being considered by the EU's 27 leaders include banning Belavia, the national airline, from EU 
airports; declaring the country's airspace unsafe; and extending travel bans and asset freezes already imposed on 
dozens of officials in Minsk over rights abuses, according to EU diplomats.
Franak Viacorka, an aide to Belarus's exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, called for a no-fly zone 
over Belarus. He also urged more sanctions on its lucrative oil and potash sectors, crucial providers of revenue for 
Lukashenko's 27-year regime.
Relations between Brussels and
Minsk have deteriorated after last year's presidential polls and the crackdown that followed. In December, European 
leaders imposed sanctions on Lukashenko and other regime members.
Belarus is still part of the "Eastern Partnership" the EU has with six states close to Russia's border, enjoying 
privileges such as a visa-facilitation agreement launched last year. The EU had once hoped to draw Minsk from the 
Kremlin's orbit but that ambition appeared doomed after Sunday's events.
Psaki said the US was co-ordinating with bilateral partners and multilateral groups including Nato. Belarus's foreign 
ministry branded the criticism of its action as "baseless", while Russia called the EU response "shocking".
Belarusian media said Lukashenko personally gave the order to divert the flight carrying 171 passengers from 
Greece to Lithuania on Sunday. Belarusian officials said a MiG-29 fighter jet had been scrambled to escort the 
airliner to Minsk following a bomb scare, which they later conceded was "false".
Merkel said that Belarus's explanations for the landing of the aircraft were "completely implausible".

 President Biden said in a statement[1] Monday his administration is developing "appropriate options" in 
coordination with the EU to hold Belarus accountable following the country's diversion of a flight to arrest an 
opposition leader. 
Driving the news: Earlier Monday, the European Council called[2] for an independent investigation into the episode, 
the submission of sanctions proposals and advised EU-based carriers to avoid and airspace. 
The big picture: A Ryanair flight en route from Greece to Lithuania was forced by Belarusian air control[3] to land in 
Belarus' capital Minsk Sunday, under the pretext of "a potential security risk on board." Belarusian authorities then 
detained Raman Pratasevich, a journalist and activist who was critical in organizing mass anti-government protests 
in Belarus last year, and his partner Sofia Sapega.Belarus' actions have been described a "hijacking" by some 
European leaders, who have vowed the country will face consequences. What they're saying: "I welcome the news 
that the European Union has called for targeted economic sanctions and other measures, and have asked my team 
to develop appropriate options to hold accountable those responsible, in close coordination with the European 
Union, other allies and partners, and international organizations," Biden said. Biden called Pratasevich's detainment 
by the Belarusian authorities is a "direct affront to international norms.""The United States joins countries around 
the world in calling for his release, as well as for the release of the hundreds of political prisoners who are being 
unjustly detained by the Lukashenka regime," he said.

T he "rules-based international order" is a dull phrase beloved by diplomats that can sound like a meaningless 
cliché. Boris Johnson, Britain's prime minister, even briefly considered instructing his officials to stop using the term.
But if anyone doubts the need for a rules-based international order, they should consider what has just happened to 
Ryanair flight FR4978 from Greece to Lithuania. The plane was crossing Belarus when it was forced to land in 
Minsk - allowing the government there to detain Roman Protasevich, a prominent Belarusian journalist, who has 
chronicled the brutal repression in his home country. The arrest was apparently made on the direct orders of 
Alexander Lukashenko, Belarus's president - who has been fighting for his political life since stealing his country's 
presidential election last year.
Belarus is a small country with a population of just under 10m. But this hijacking and kidnap by the Lukashenko 
regime sets a dangerous global precedent. It will be watched closely by much larger countries that also like to 
pursue their domestic enemies overseas - in particular Russia (which is Belarus's closest ally), China and Iran.
Passengers flying from Europe to Asia will often have glanced at their flight maps and realised that they are 
crossing over Russia or Iran. What was once an interesting geographical observation may now be a cause for slight 
concern. If even tiny Belarus can demand that a plane divert to Minsk, what is to stop the Iranians from compelling 
a plane to land in Tehran, or the Russians from forcing a jet down over Siberia?
Once the precedent is established, the potential threat will extend well beyond countries' own citizens - and even 
beyond their own borders.
Belarus kidnap sets dangerous precedent
Those who have wondered why it is worth disputing China's claim to sovereignty over the whole of the South China 
Sea may now understand the point better. Roughly one-third of the world's maritime trade crosses those waters. If 
China could claim the right to intercept any ship or plane crossing the South China Sea, it would have a 
stranglehold over global trade.
The threat of detention extends not just to Chinese, Russian or Iranian dissidents living abroad. Potentially, it 
extends to foreigners who have displeased those regimes. The Russian government has made persistent efforts to 
secure the arrest of Bill Browder, a US-born British investor who drove the successful campaign to impose 
"Magnitsky sanctions" on Moscow.
One of the Europeans sanctioned by China recently told me that he was not concerned by his inability to travel to
China itself. But he did worry that Beijing might try to arrange for his arrest, in transit, in a third country. "After all", 
as my contact put it, "they'll think that's the kind of thing that superpowers do."
"  That thought raises the unfortunate precedent set by the US through its policies of drone strikes and 
"extraordnary renditions", during its "war on terror". The Americans can point out that this kind of treatment was 
reserved for those who used or planned actual violence against the US or its allies. But, to invert the old saying, one 
man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist. Belarus had placed Protasevich on a terrorist watchlist.
Nobody reasonable should accept the Belarusian (or Chinese or Russian) equation of peaceful dissent with 
terrorism. But America has encouraged the idea that powerful countries can reach out beyond their borders and 
grab people.
Those powers are alarming even when exercised by the US - a lawgoverned country committed to freedom of 
speech. When they are claimed by one-party states, dictatorships and assorted strongman leaders around the 
globe, they are a recipe for a much more dangerous and lawless world.
The disturbing reality is that authoritarian countries are increasingly resorting to what Freedom House, a USbased 
pro-democracy organisation, calls in a report released in February, "transnational repression".
The report pointed to six countries that use methods such as "assassinations, illegal deportations [and] abductions" 
to silence dissent overseas: China, Turkey, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iran - with China highlighted as the 
country that conducts the "most sophisticated, global and comprehensive campaign of transnational repression in 
the world". The victims of these campaigns include Gui Minhai, a Chinese-born Swedish citizen, who had published 
books on the private lives of prominent members of the Chinese Communist party. He was kidnapped in Thailand in 
2015 and later sent to prison in China. Another is Paul Rusesabagina, a Rwandan political activist, kidnapped in 
Dubai in 2020, and then put on trial in Rwanda on terrorism charges.
The action taken by Belarus represents a flagrant escalation of this trend. But this dangerous moment also 
represents an opportunity to arrest the slide into international lawlessness.
The EU, the US, the UK and others should now act together to ensure that Belarus's move is seen to have 
consequences - for example by announcing that Belarusian airspace is unsafe and then banning international 
flights in or out of the country. If Lukashenko behaves like an international outlaw, he should be treated as one. It is 
time to defend international law and order, before it is too late.

Minsk - allowing the government there to detain Roman Protasevich, a prominent Belarusian journalist, who has 
chronicled the brutal repression in his home country. The arrest was apparently made on the direct orders of 
Alexander Lukashenko, Belarus's president - who has been fighting for his political life since stealing his country's 
presidential election last year.
Belarus is a small country with a population of just under 10m. But this hijacking and kidnap by the Lukashenko 
regime sets a dangerous global precedent. It will be watched closely by much larger countries that also like to 
pursue their domestic enemies overseas - in particular Russia (which is Belarus's closest ally), China and Iran.
Passengers flying from Europe to Asia will often have glanced at their flight maps and realised that they are 
crossing over Russia or Iran. What was once an interesting geographical observation may now be a cause for slight 
concern. If even tiny Belarus can demand that a plane divert to Minsk, what is to stop the Iranians from compelling 
a plane to land in Tehran, or the Russians from forcing a jet down over Siberia?

Once the precedent is established, the potential threat will extend well beyond countries' own citizens - and even 
beyond their own borders.
Those who have wondered why it is worth disputing China's claim to sovereignty over the whole of the South China 
Sea may now understand the point better. Roughly one-third of the world's maritime trade crosses those waters. If 
China could claim the right to intercept any ship or plane crossing the South China Sea, it would have a 
stranglehold over global trade.
The threat of detention extends not just to Chinese, Russian or Iranian dissidents living abroad. Potentially, it 
extends to foreigners who have displeased those regimes. The Russian government has made persistent efforts to 
secure the arrest of Bill Browder, a US-born British investor who drove the successful campaign to impose 
"Magnitsky sanctions" on Moscow.
One of the Europeans sanctioned by China recently told me that he was not concerned by his inability to travel to
China itself. But he did worry that Beijing might try to arrange for his arrest, in transit, in a third country. "After all",

"extraordnary renditions", during its "war on terror". The Americans can point out that this kind of treatment was 
reserved for those who used or planned actual violence against the US or its allies. But, to invert the old saying, one 
man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist. Belarus had placed Protasevich on a terrorist watchlist.
Nobody reasonable should accept the Belarusian (or Chinese or Russian) equation of peaceful dissent with 
terrorism. But America has encouraged the idea that powerful countries can reach out beyond their borders and 
grab people.
Those powers are alarming even when exercised by the US - a lawgoverned country committed to freedom of 
speech. When they are claimed by one-party states, dictatorships and assorted strongman leaders around the 
globe, they are a recipe for a much more dangerous and lawless world.
The disturbing reality is that authoritarian countries are increasingly resorting to what Freedom House, a USbased 
pro-democracy organisation, calls in a report released in February, "transnational repression".
The report pointed to six countries that use methods such as "assassinations, illegal deportations [and] abductions" 
to silence dissent overseas: China, Turkey, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iran - with China highlighted as the 
country that conducts the "most sophisticated, global and comprehensive campaign of transnational repression in 
the world". The victims of these campaigns include Gui Minhai, a Chinese-born Swedish citizen, who had published 
books on the private lives of prominent members of the Chinese Communist party. He was kidnapped in Thailand in 
2015 and later sent to prison in China. Another is Paul Rusesabagina, a Rwandan political activist, kidnapped in 
Dubai in 2020, and then put on trial in Rwanda on terrorism charges.
The action taken by Belarus represents a flagrant escalation of this trend. But this dangerous moment also 
represents an opportunity to arrest the slide into international lawlessness.
The EU, the US, the UK and others should now act together to ensure that Belarus's move is seen to have 
consequences - for example by announcing that Belarusian airspace is unsafe and then banning international 
flights in or out of the country. If Lukashenko behaves like an international outlaw, he should be treated as one. It is 
time to defend international law and order, before it is too late.

 Over the weekend, Belarusian air control forced a Ryanair flight traveling from Greece to Lithuania to divert and 
land in the Belarusian capital of Minsk. While the plane was grounded, Belarusian officials apparently arrested and 
detained journalist and dissident activist Roman Protasevich, who has been living in exile in Poland since 2019. 
Since then, the European Union has said it will impose sanctions, the EU and the US have called for Protasevich's 
release, and the regime of Russian President Vladimir Putin has signaled its support for Belarus' actions. Mediaite 
breaks it all down. 
 In a nutshell, what's happening? 
 On Sunday, May 23, the president of Belarus, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, sent a fighter jet to intercept a Ryanair 
plane heading from Athens, Greece, to Vilnius, Lithuania, while the plane was over Belarusian air space, forcing the 
plane to land in the capital, Minsk. 
 According to reports, when the plane was on the ground in Belarus, dissident journalist Roman Protasevich was 
'seized' and arrested. Belarusian authorities have since posted a video[1] of Protasevich, in which he said that 
authorities have treated him 'correctly' and 'lawfully.' 
 So, what exactly happened with the plane? 
 According to a statement[2] from Ryanair, the popular low-cost airline based out of Ireland, the crew was notified 
by Belarusian air traffic controllers of a 'potential security threat on board and were instructed to divert to the 
nearest airport, Minsk.' 
 'The airport landed safely and passengers were offloaded while security checks were completed by local 
authorities,' the statement continued. 'Nothing untoward was found and authorities cleared the aircraft to depart 
together with passengers and crew after approx. 7hrs on the ground in Minsk.' 
 After noting that the plane landed safely in Vilnius, Ryanair said 'we apologise sincerely to all affected passengers 
for this regrettable delay, which was outside Ryanair's control.' 
 What the statement doesn't mention is the fact that after the plane landed, as the passengers were having their 
luggage inspected after having been ordered to get out of the plane, Protasevich was arrested and did not re-board 
the plane - and it appeared that he had a sense of what was coming. 
What's Happening With the Dissident Journalist Detained in Belarus , and How Is Putin Involved?
 According to the New York Times[3], Protasevich 'started to panic' once it was announced that the plane would be 
landing in Minsk. That announcement came about 15 minutes after the Ryanair plane had been diverted. 
 'He panicked because we were about to land in Minsk,' Marius Rutkauskas, who was sitting one row ahead of 
Protasevich, told the Lithuanian broadcaster LRT upon arrival in Vilnius, the Times reported. 'He said: 'I know that 
death penalty awaits me in Belarus.'' 
 Another passenger told AFP that 'it was clear that he was very much afraid,' the Times reported. 'It looked like if 
the window had been open, he would have jumped out of it.' 
 One passenger told a Lithuanian news website that the pilot was 'visibly nervous' during the landing in Minsk, 
according to the Times, and another told a news website that once they were on the ground in Belarus, it became 
apparent that the alleged 'security threat' was just a ruse. 
 Protasevich's partner, Sofia Sapega, was also not allowed to reboard the flight, the Times reported[4]. 
 Lukashenko's press service had a different story, saying that the president, often referred to as 'Europe's last 
dictator,' ordered a fighter jet to escort the plane to Minsk after a bomb threat, the Times reported. 
 No bomb was found on board. Apparently, some passengers learned about the bomb threat hours after the 
incident, when they had internet access, the Times report said. 
 The chief executive of Ryanair has since called the incident[5] a 'state-sponsored hijacking.' 
 Can Belarus just do that? 
 According to international aviation law[6], apparently, yes - but only if Belarus truly believed there was a threat to 
the plane over Belarusian airspace, and did not manufacture that threat, according to a Washington Post 
analysis[7]. 
 International rules governing aviation safety, known as the Chicago Convention, state that countries have 
'complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above (their) territory,' the Post said. Belarus is a signatory 
to these rules. 
 But Belarus could have violated these rules 'if it manufactured the threat and forced the plane to land in Minsk,' the 
Post said. Another possible violation would have occurred if Belarus did not manufacture the threat, 'but still forced 
the plane to land in Minsk for purposes that were not related to the threat.' 
 Who is the journalist at the center of all of this? 
 Roman Protasevich is a 26-year-old dissident journalist, who has long been protesting the Lukashenko 
government, according to a Washington Post report[8]. He is the editor of the news platform Nexta, which publishes 
on the secure direct-messaging platform Telegram. Nexta, which reportedly has some 2 million users, provided 
information and videos during protests against Lukashenko's government. 
 Protasevich studied journalism in Belarus, worked for European Radio and other news organizations, and was 
named a fellow in a joint US-Czech program that offers training and mentorship to young journalists from Eastern 
Europe and Russia, the Post reported. 
 In 2019, Protasevich fled Belarus for Poland, where he was granted political asylum. He continued to run Nexta 
from there. In 2020, after Lukashenko claimed a landslide victory in an election widely condemned[9] as fraudulent, 
Nexta was key to coordinating peaceful protests against Lukashenko, led by opposition presidential candidate 
Svetlana Tikhanovskaya. 
 He was on the Ryanair plane after having attended an economic conference in Greece, which Tikhanovskaya also 
attended, according to the Times[10]. 
 The Belarusian security agency, called the KGB, had placed Protasevich's name on a list of terrorists. If he is 
accused and convicted of terrorism, Protasevich could face the death penalty. He also faces charges of inciting 
public disorder and social hatred, which could land him in prison for more than 12 years. 
 Is Russia involved? 
 It's unclear. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told journalists[11] that Belarus had taken an 'absolutely 
reasonable approach' in forcing the plane to land, although the Kremlin itself declined to comment on the incident. 
 However, Russia has been a financial - and ideological - backer[12] of the Lukashenko regime, and offered 
Russian police support following the 2020 Belarus elections, and some analysts believe that Putin could have been 
behind the entire incident. 
 'Analysts at the German Council on Foreign Relations believe that Putin's Russia could have been 'testing a new 
method of 'rogue' action, using Belarus as a testing ground,'' Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported[13]. 
What's Happening With the Dissident Journalist Detained in Belarus , and How Is Putin Involved?
 Others have speculated[14] that Belarus would not have taken such action without Russian approval, while some 
believe that the Russians 'could have been security agents involved in the operation to deliver Pratasevich to the 
Belarusian authorities,' the report said. 
 According to the Times, the Ryanair plane was 'surrounded by Soviet-looking officials in green uniforms, along with 
dogs, fire crews and technical workers from the airport' upon landing in Minsk. 
 Is the US doing anything about this? 
 Monday evening, President Joe Biden called the incident[15] a 'direct affront to international norms' and demanded 
Protasavich's release and an international investigation. 
 'The United States condemns in the strongest possible terms both the diversion of the plane and the subsequent 
removal of Mr. Pratasevich,' Biden said in a statement. 'This outrageous incident and the video Mr. Pratasevich 
appears to have made under duress are shameful assaults on both political dissent and freedom of the press.' 
 'The United States joins countries around the world in calling for his release,' Biden said, adding: 'I join the many 
calls for an international investigation to ascertain the complete facts of the case.' 
 What about the EU? 
 EU leaders have demanded[16] the release of Protasevich and Sapega, with several of them calling the incident a 
'hijacking' and 'state-sponsored terrorism,' and called for a new round of sanctions against Belarus. 
 The EU has also called on[17] all EU-based airlines to stop flying over Belarus, and to begin the process of 
banning Belarusian airlines from flying over EU airspace or landing in its airports. 
 The EU has previously imposed sanctions on Lukashenko and some of his associates after the 2020 election, 
which European officials have said was neither free nor fair, according to the Times.

Even by the thuggish if capricious standards of Belarus dictator Alexander Lukashenko, the forced diversion of a 
Ryanair flight in order to arrest one of its passengers is an outrage. The Boeing 737 flying from Athens to Vilnius on 
Sunday was rerouted to Minsk after being notified of a bomb threat invented by the Belarusian authorities. A 
Belarusian fighter jet was scrambled to ensure the airliner complied. When it landed in Minsk, the authorities 
arrested Roman Protasevich, a Belarusian journalist and opposition activist, on terrorism charges. The operation, 
which Belarusian media said Lukashenko personally ordered, amounts to nothing less than state piracy. It demands 
a swift and robust riposte.
Western powers, and particularly the EU, have struggled to muster an adequate response to Lukashenko's theft of 
last year's presidential election and repression of the pro-democracy movement that erupted in protest. Belarus' 
limited economic ties to its western neighbours and its heavy dependence on Russia left the EU with little leverage. 
European leaders were rightly wary of imposing sanctions that brought more hardship on the Belarusian people. 
Held back by internal divisions, they have also struggled to take a robust stance on Russian president Vladimir 
Putin's aggression abroad and crushing of opposition at home.
But the official hijacking of a European aircraft carrying mostly EU passengers cannot go unpunished. Just as the 
shooting down of Malaysia Airlines MH17 by a Russian missile over Ukraine in 2014 spurred the EU into imposing 
tougher economic sanctions on Moscow, so must this episode worthy of a rogue state. Additional sanctions against 
Lukashenko and his officials are unlikely to be any more effective than the EU penalties imposed last autumn - a 
slap on the wrist.
Lukashenko's air piracy must be punished; TUESDAY 25 MAY 2021 Sanctions over Belarus's hijacking are a 
credibility test for the west
Stopping flights through Belarusian airspace and banning national flag carrier Belavia from serving European 
destinations - a decision for national capitals - would be a suitable response to Lukashenko's flagrant breach of 
aviation law. It would of course penalise Belarusians if other carriers were unable to offer replacement services. 
Sanctions should be targeted as much as possible. But it is wealthier Belarusians - often aligned with the 
Lukashenko regime - who enjoy air travel. Conversely, restricting land crossings into the EU, especially to Poland, 
would cut off an existing route for Belarusians looking for work or political freedom.
Sanctions against Belarusian oligarchs who are helping to prop up Lukashenko's regime would send a more 
powerful message of disapproval. Crony businessmen will have to pay a price for their support. Even this is 
insufficient. Belarus' opposition is now calling for wider economic sanctions, including against key exports of fuel 
and potash, which are an important source of revenue for Lukashenko's rule. The EU, with UK and US support, 
should be prepared to impose them if the oppression of democracy and human rights campaigners does not relent, 
and activists such as Protasevich are not released.
In the past, the argument against sectoral sanctions was that it would drive Belarus further away from the west and 
into Russia's orbit. That argument no longer applies. Lukashenko survives at Putin's whim. He is now entirely 
dependent on the Kremlin. That makes it unlikely Moscow had no knowledge of Lukashenko's hijacking plot; 
suspiciously, several Russian nationals left the Ryanair flight in Minsk. If Russian involvement is demonstrated, 
retaliation will be needed against Moscow as well. Lukashenko's rogue regime belongs to Putin too.

Even by the thuggish if capricious standards of Belarus dictator Alexander Lukashenko, the forced diversion of a 
Ryanair flight in order to arrest one of its passengers is an outrage. The Boeing 737 flying from Athens to Vilnius on 
Sunday was rerouted to Minsk after being notified of a bomb threat invented by the Belarusian authorities. A 
Belarusian fighter jet was scrambled to ensure the airliner complied. When it landed in Minsk, the authorities 
arrested Roman Protasevich, a Belarusian journalist and opposition activist, on terrorism charges. The operation, 
which Belarusian media said Lukashenko personally ordered, amounts to nothing less than state piracy. It demands 
a swift and robust riposte.
Western powers, and particularly the EU, have struggled to muster an adequate response to Lukashenko's theft of 
last year's presidential election and repression of the pro-democracy movement that erupted in protest. Belarus' 
limited economic ties to its western neighbours and its heavy dependence on Russia left the EU with little leverage. 
European leaders were rightly wary of imposing sanctions that brought more hardship on the Belarusian people. 
Held back by internal divisions, they have also struggled to take a robust stance on Russian president Vladimir 
Putin's aggression abroad and crushing of opposition at home.
But the official hijacking of a European aircraft carrying mostly EU passengers cannot go unpunished. Just as the 
shooting down of Malaysia Airlines MH17 by a Russian missile over Ukraine in 2014 spurred the EU into imposing 
tougher economic sanctions on Moscow, so must this episode worthy of a rogue state. Additional sanctions against 
Lukashenko and his officials are unlikely to be any more effective than the EU penalties imposed last autumn - a 
slap on the wrist.
Lukashenko's air piracy must be punished TUESDAY 25 MAY 2021 Sanctions over Belarus 's hijacking are a 
credibility test for the west
Stopping flights through Belarusian airspace and banning national flag carrier Belavia from serving European 
destinations - a decision for national capitals - would be a suitable response to Lukashenko's flagrant breach of 
aviation law. It would of course penalise Belarusians if other carriers were unable to offer replacement services. 
Sanctions should be targeted as much as possible. But it is wealthier Belarusians - often aligned with the 
Lukashenko regime - who enjoy air travel. Conversely, restricting land crossings into the EU, especially to Poland, 
would cut off an existing route for Belarusians looking for work or political freedom.
Sanctions against Belarusian oligarchs who are helping to prop up Lukashenko's regime would send a more 
powerful message of disapproval. Crony businessmen will have to pay a price for their support. Even this is 
insufficient. Belarus' opposition is now calling for wider economic sanctions, including against key exports of fuel 
and potash, which are an important source of revenue for Lukashenko's rule. The EU, with UK and US support, 
should be prepared to impose them if the oppression of democracy and human rights campaigners does not relent, 
and activists such as Protasevich are not released.
In the past, the argument against sectoral sanctions was that it would drive Belarus further away from the west and 
into Russia's orbit. That argument no longer applies. Lukashenko survives at Putin's whim. He is now entirely 
dependent on the Kremlin. That makes it unlikely Moscow had no knowledge of Lukashenko's hijacking plot; 
suspiciously, several Russian nationals left the Ryanair flight in Minsk. If Russian involvement is demonstrated, 
retaliation will be needed against Moscow as well. Lukashenko's rogue regime belongs to Putin too.

Belarus opposition calls for more pressure after plane arrest

 Belarus's opposition called Tuesday for more pressure on strongman Alexander Lukashenko as Europe moved to 
cut air links with the country over the extraordinary diversion of an airliner and arrest of a dissident on board. 
 The forced landing of the Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius on Sunday and arrest of opposition journalist Roman 
Protasevich sparked an international outcry and calls for tough action against the longtime Belarusian leader. 
 European Union leaders took a first step on Monday, agreeing at a summit to ban Belarusian airlines from the bloc 
and calling on EU-based carriers not to fly over its airspace. 
 Exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya urged the international community to go further in isolating the 
regime. 
 In a call with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Tikhanovskaya asked the United States to 'isolate the 
regime and pressure it through sanctions', she said on Twitter. 
 In a separate post on her Telegram channel, Tikhanovskaya, who lives in Lithuania, said she asked for the 
opposition to be invited to next month's G7 summit in Britain. 
 'The situation with the hijacking of the plane cannot be considered separately from other repressions and flagrant 
violations of human rights in Belarus,' she said. 
 EU leaders on Monday warned they would adopt further 'targeted economic sanctions' against the Belarusian 
authorities to add to the 88 regime figures and seven companies already on a blacklist over a crackdown on 
opposition. 
 The UN rights office also demanded the immediate release of Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, who 
was also arrested. 
- Video 'confession' - 
Lukashenko and his allies are already under a series of Western sanctions over a brutal crackdown on opposition 
protests that followed his disputed re-election to a sixth term in August last year. 
 Protasevich, 26, was a co-founder of the Nexta Telegram channel, which helped organise the protests that were 
the biggest challenge to Lukashenko's 26-year rule. 
 He had been living between Poland and Lithuania. 
Belarus opposition calls for more pressure after plane arrest
 Belarusian state television late on Monday broadcast a 30-second video of Protasevich confirming that he was in 
prison in Minsk and 'confessing' to charges of organising mass unrest. 
 The footage showed Protasevich — who could face 15 years in jail — with dark markings visible on his forehead, 
saying he was being treated 'according to the law'. 
 His allies say the video was made under pressure from authorities, with Tikhanovskaya saying there was 'no doubt 
that Roman was being tortured in prison'. 
 US President Joe Biden slammed the forced diversion of the plane and arrest of Protasevich as 'a direct affront to 
international norms' and said the video appeared to have been made 'under duress'. 
 'I welcome the news that the European Union has called for targeted economic sanctions and other measures, and 
have asked my team to develop appropriate options to hold accountable those responsible,' Biden said in a White 
House statement. 
- 'Not his words' - 
Protasevich's father Dmitry Protasevich told AFP in Poland that he had not been able to contact his son since 
Saturday and that he did not appear himself in the video. 
 'It's clear that he was physically harmed because you can see signs of a beating on his face,' he said. 
 'He would never speak like that. Those were not his words he was reading something out that he was told to read 
out.' 
 Minsk said it had reacted to secure the flight after receiving a bomb threat, supposedly from Palestinian Islamist 
group Hamas, but European leaders dismissed the claim as implausible. 
 Lukashenko — who scrambled a Belarusian fighter jet to intercept the Ryanair flight — has remained defiant in the 
face of sanctions with help from his main backer Russia. 
 Moscow has dismissed the outrage in the West, saying Belarus was acting reasonably and within the law when the 
plane was diverted. 
 Air France, Finnair and Singapore Airlines on Tuesday became the latest carriers to suspend flights over Belarus, 
following Scandinavian airline SAS, Germany's Lufthansa and Latvia-based regional airline Air Baltic. 
- More activists jailed - 
Neighbouring Ukraine has also said it would halt direct flights between the two countries and over Belarus. 
 The EU has demanded a probe by the International Civil Aviation Organization, a UN agency, which is to meet on 
Thursday. 
 Last year's protests gripped the country for months, with tens of thousands taking to the streets to denounce 
Lukashenko's rule. 
 The 66-year-old leader has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for over two decades and responded to the 
demonstrations with a violent crackdown, detaining thousands, many of whom reported torture and abuse in 
custody. 
 Many protest leaders — including Tikhanovskaya who claimed victory in the August vote — fled the country and 
the demonstrations have dwindled. 
 Authorities have in recent months imposed a series of jail sentences on organisers, participants and journalists 
over the protests. 
 Seven activists, including senior opposition figure Pavel Severinets, were sentenced on Tuesday to jail terms of 
four to seven years after being found guilty of taking part in 'mass unrest'.

May 25, 2021( The Week UK: http://www.theweek.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  
 The father of arrested Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich has said he fears his son has been 'beaten and 
tortured' after a video emerged of the 26-year-old that appears to have been recorded under duress. 
Protasevichis said to be a 'personal enemy' of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, according to CNBC[1], 
having beenone of the original editors of Nexta, aTelegram blogging channelthat was one of the most important 
sources of public information during last summer'smass anti-regime demonstrations. 
Protasevich's Lithuania-bound Ryanair flight was forced to divertto Minsk as it flew over Belarusian airspace on 
Sunday, with Belarusian authorities citinga bomb threat on board and scrambling a fighter jet to intercept it. 
A 'trembling'Protasevich was led away by police shortly after landing in Minsk, reports The Guardian[2], with the 
journalist telling fellow passengers: 'I'm facing the death penalty here.' 
In the clip released late on Monday night, the opposition journalist appeared to confess to crimes he had been 
charged with by the Belarusian state, but colleagues and state opposition leaders claim he was under pressure to 
admit wrongdoing. His father told the BBC[3] that he was 'really afraid' of how his son would be treated, adding: 
'This sort of thing shouldn't be happening in the 21st century at the heart of Europe.' A 'new norm'? Critics say 
thearrest is indicative of a larger trend of 'transnational repression' as states increasingly reach across international 
borders to arrest or threaten their dissident citizens. 
What has happened to Protasevich'belongs alongside' other stories of dissident arrest, harassment and killing by 
strongmen-led governments, saysAnne Applebaum in The Atlantic[4]. 
Events such as the Salisbury poisonings[5], where a nerve agent was used on British soil in an attemptto kill 
enemies of the Kremlin, the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi[6]inside Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul, the 
assassination of Iranian dissidents in the Netherlands and Turkey, and the kidnapping and detention of Chinese 
nationals living abroad, all form part of this 'new norm', says Applebaum. 'Authoritarian states in pursuit of their 
enemies no longer feel the need to respect passports, borders, diplomatic customs, or - now - the rules of air-traffic 
control,'she writes. 
Indeed, although 'rules-based international order' is often considered a 'dull term', thedecision to force Protasevich's 
Ryanair flight to land in Belarusis a breach of it, and it setsa 'dangerous global precedent', writes Gideon Rachman 
in the Financial Times[7]. 
Are political exiles safe?
Larger countries 'that also like to pursue their domestic enemies overseas' - Russia, China and Iran - will be 
watching the episode'closely', says Rachman. After all, 'if even tiny Belarus can demand that a plane divert to 
Minsk, what is to stop the Iranians from compelling a plane to land in Tehran, or the Russians from forcing a jet 
down over Siberia?' 
Freedom House[8], a US-based pro-democracy group, recently released a report that points to six countries using 
'assassinations, illegal deportations [and] abductions' to silence dissidents and 'control their citizens', which it called 
'transnational repression'. 
It said China, Turkey, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iran currently wage the most 'aggressive' campaigns of 
transnational repression, with the report compiling more than 600 cases since 2014. How safe is the EU for exiles? 
In Protasevich's home country of Belarus, other exiles are beginning to worry their 'adopted European homes aren't 
necessarily safe', reports Bloomberg[9]. 
Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who was forced to flee the state nine months ago, 
told reporters she had taken 'the same flight' from Athens a week ago. 
'I could be in Roman's place right now. From now on, no person who flies over Belarusian airspace is guaranteed 
basic safety,' she said. 
Vladimir Milov, a critic of Russian presidentVladimir Putin [10]and currently living in Lithuania, said the event had 
broken the 'illusion' of safety he felt living in the European Union, often seen as a safe haven for journalists and 
exiles escaping from authoritarian regimes. 
'There is an illusion that you live on the territory of the European Union under the protection of the European police 
and everything seems OK,'he said. 
Indeed, the bloc's 'values of political pluralism and freedom of speech, [and] rights-based protection' means fleeing 
dissidents have expected to live in relative safety within the EU, says OpenDemocracy[11]. But a 'steady stream of 
harassment and attacks, extraditions, deportations and kidnappings' has put that idea 'under serious strain' in 
recent years. 
Lithuanian officials have asked for more funds to protect Belarusian dissidents residing in the country, citing an 
increased risk, while Poland's foreign minister has warned opposition activists they are 'moving targets' for the 
KGB. 
But the threat of arrest by authoritarian regimes doesn't simply extend to their citizens. Increasingly foreigners who 
have criticised such regimes are at risk too. 
Bill Browder, the US-born British investor who led the successful campaign to impose 'Magnitsky sanctions' on 
Moscow, has been repeatedly targeted by the Kremlin. In 2019, The Times[12] reported that Russia had tried to 
have Browder arrested by Interpol eight times.

 Belarus's regime was increasingly isolated Tuesday as Europe cut air links and calls grew for more action over its 
diversion of an airliner and arrest of a dissident on board. 
 After weathering a wave of protests and Western sanctions last year, President Alexander Lukashenko wasfacing 
extraordinary new pressure over Sunday's rerouting of the Ryanair flight to Minsk and arrest of opposition journalist 
Roman Protasevich. 
 More Western leaders joined calls demanding Protasevich's release, after the European Union agreed at a summit 
on Monday to ban Belarusian airlines from the bloc and called on EU-based carriers not to fly over its airspace. 
 Air France, Finnair and Singapore Airlines became the latest carriers to suspend flights over Belarus, following 
Scandinavian airline SAS, Germany's Lufthansa and Latvia-based regional airline airBaltic. 
 Opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said the international community needed to go further, urging the 
United States to take action in a call with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. 
 Speaking to reporters in Vilnius where she lives in exile after a disputed election last August, Tikhanovskaya called 
for 'comprehensive' international measures to force the regime to give up power. 
 'This is the time to act,' she said. 
 'Suspension of flights over Belarus doesn't solve the real problem. The problem is the terrorist regime that rigged 
elections last year.' 
- Call to join G7 summit - 
She asked for the Belarusian opposition to be invited to next month's G7 summit in Britain, an initiative that sources 
close to French President Emmanuel Macron said Paris supported. 
 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined calls for Protasevich to be released, warning: 'Belarus's actions will 
have consequences.' 
 The UN rights office also demanded the immediate release of Protasevich and his Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega, 
who was also arrested after the Athens-to-Vilnius flight landed in Minsk. 
 EU leaders on Monday warned they would adopt further 'targeted economic sanctions' against the Belarusian 
authorities to add to the 88 regime figures and seven companies on a blacklist. 
Belarus isolation grows as air links cut over diverted plane
 Lukashenko and his allies are already under a series of Western sanctions over a brutal crackdown on opposition 
protests that followed his disputed re-election to a sixth term last August. 
 Protasevich, 26, was a co-founder of the Nexta Telegram channel, which helped organise the protests that were 
the biggest challenge to Lukashenko's long rule. 
 He had been living between Poland and Lithuania. 
 Belarusian state television late on Monday broadcast a 30-second video of Protasevich confirming that he was in

- 'Not his words' - 
The footage showed Protasevich — who could face 15 years in jail — with dark markings visible on his forehead, 
saying he was being treated 'according to the law'. 
 US President Joe Biden said the video appeared to have been made 'under duress'. He welcomed the EU moves 
and said Washington was looking at 'appropriate options to hold accountable those responsible.' 
 Protasevich's father Dmitry Protasevich told AFP in Poland that it looked like his son had been harmed and was 
under pressure. 
 'He would never speak like that. Those were not his words he was reading something out that he was told to read 
out,' he said. 
 Minsk said it had reacted to secure the flight after receiving a bomb threat, supposedly from Palestinian Islamist 
group Hamas, but European leaders dismissed the claim as implausible. 
 The transport ministry on Tuesday released a transcript of the call between Minsk air traffic control and the Ryanair 
flight, in which the crew was told 'you have a bomb a board' and urged it to land in Minsk. 
 Lukashenko — who scrambled a Belarusian fighter jet to intercept the Ryanair flight — has remained defiant in the 
face of sanctions with help from his main backer Russia. 
- 'Belarusians cannot afford flights' - 
Moscow has dismissed the outrage in the West, saying Belarus was acting reasonably and within the law when the 
plane was diverted. 
 Last year's protests gripped the country for months, with tens of thousands taking to the streets to denounce 
Lukashenko's regime. 
 The 66-year-old leader has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for over two decades and responded to the 
demonstrations with a violent crackdown, detaining thousands, many of whom reported torture and abuse in 
custody. 
 Many protest leaders — including Tikhanovskaya who claimed victory in the August vote — fled the country and 
the demonstrations have dwindled. 
 Authorities have imposed a series of jail sentences on organisers, participants and journalists over the protests, 
including seven activists who were sentenced Tuesday to jail terms of four to seven years. 
 On the streets of Minsk, many opposition supporters welcomed the flight bans, saying Belarusians were largely 
unable to travel anyway and more pressure was needed for change. 
 'An ordinary Belarusian will not suffer from this. Ordinary Belarusians cannot afford flights,' said Valentina, a retired 
teacher who like others who spoke to AFP was afraid to give her last name. 
 Severin, a blogger, said such moves were needed to force the regime to accept the results of last August's vote. 
 'Should crimes be ignored so that someone can go on business trips or to resorts? Not when war is declared. And 
war has been declared on us since August 9 last year.'

 The forced landing of a passenger flight in Belarus and the subsequent arrest of a dissident has sparked backlash 
across 
the 
continent. 
Belarus' 
opposition 
has 
called 
for 
tougher 
measures 
against 
Lukashenko's 
government.Several European airlines announced on Tuesday that they are suspending flights over Belarus after 
Minsk forced a Ryanair jet to land to arrest a dissident journalist. 
European Union leaders had urged airlines to avoid Belarus' airspace as they imposed sanctions against the 
government of longtime leader Alexander Lukashenko. 
EU Council President Charles Michel shared an image on Twitter showing air traffic cleared over Belarus, with the 
caption "Europe in action."  
Western leaders accused Belarusian authorities of hijacking the passenger plane during its flight on Sunday, while 
Minsk claimed it was trying to secure the jet after receiving a bomb threat. 
Which airlines are affected? 
Air France said in a statement it had "taken note" of the conclusions of Monday's EU summit and had suspended 
flights over Belarus "until further notice." 
Finland's flag carrier Finnair and Polish airline LOT also said they would stop using Belarusian airspace. 
Germany's Lufthansa, Dutch KLM, Scandinavian SAS and Latvian Air Baltic made similar announcements on 
Monday. 
Singapore Airlines is also rerouting flights "that are bound for Europe to avoid the Belarusian airspace" and will 
continue to "closely monitor the situation," AFP news agency quoted a spokesperson as saying. 
How has the Belarusian opposition reacted? 
Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya on Tuesday called on Western leaders to ramp up 
pressure on the Belarus government. 
"The situation with the hijacking of the plane cannot be considered separately from other repressions and flagrant 
violations of human rights in Belarus," Tsikhanouskaya said. 
In a call with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Tsikhanouskaya "called on the United States to isolate the 
regime and pressure it through sanctions," she said on Twitter. 
The opposition figure also said that she asked for the Belarusian opposition to be invited to next month's G7 summit 
in Britain. 
Belarus: European airlines halt flights amid outrage over plane arrest
"All of this is a result of the regime's impunity and the lack of a decisive response from the international community," 
she added. 
How have world powers responded so far? 
The United Nations rights office demanded the immediate release of 26-year-old Raman Pratasevich, the 
Belarusian activist journalist who was detained after the plane landed on Sunday.  
"We are shocked by the unlawful arrest and arbitrary detention," spokesman Rupert Colville told reporters in 
Geneva.  
"The manner, through threat of military force, in which Protasevich was abducted from the jurisdiction of another 
state and brought within that of Belarus, was tantamount to an extraordinary rendition." 
The EU has since banned Belarusian carriers from flying over the bloc's airspace. The bloc also called for the 
release of Pratasevich.  
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed the EU sanctions, adding that the "forced landing of a 
passenger flight by Belarus was dangerous." 
US President Joe Biden said his administration was looking into "appropriate options to hold accountable those 
responsible, in close coordination with the European Union." 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel described the Belarusian government's account of the incident as "completely 
implausible." 
What has Belarus said?  
Belarus, which said it stopped the plane over a security threat, claimed Western countries were making "unfounded 
accusations" about the event for political reasons. 
On Tuesday, Belarus said it had invited European, US and international aviation officials to investigate the incident. 
Russia, an ally of Belarus, has defended Minsk's handling of the crisis.

anyone doubts the need for a rules-based international order, they should consider what has just happened to

 The UK government advised all British airlines to stop using Belarusian airspace after a Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) 
aircraft was forced to land in Minsk by the Belarusian authorities to arrest journalist Roman Protasevich.
Britain also suspended the operating permit of the Belarusian airline Belavia to fly between the UK and Belarus, 
according to a Tuesday release.
British Ambassador Neil Bush condemned the actions and said there was no evidence to support the claim that 
there was an alleged bomb threat related to the flight.
Bush said the event was "yet another shocking assault on human rights and freedom of the press by the Belarusian 
authorities" and called for the "immediate and unconditional release" of Protasevich.
Ryanair's shares climbed over 2% on Tuesday's close.

 From their new home in Poland, the parents of Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich have been in anguish 
since he was seized after his flight was forced to land in Minsk. 
 Natalia Protasevich, the 26-year-old's mother, said she has not slept for two nights and grips her phone tightly, 
hoping for any news about her son. 
 'I'm asking, I'm begging, I'm calling on the whole international community to save him,' Natalia said, breaking down 
in tears during an interview with AFP near the train station in Wroclaw, southern Poland. 
 'He's only one journalist, he's only one child but please, please I am begging for help. Please save him! They're 
going to kill him in there!' 
 Natalia, 46, and her husband Dmitry, 48, said they think Roman might be in a detention centre run by the secret 
service, still known as the KGB. 
 But they do not know for sure and the uncertainty is torturing them. 
 'The lawyer tried to see him today but she was turned down, she could not see him. We still don't know if he is in 
there, what his condition is, how he is feeling,' said Dmitry, a former soldier. 
 'One of the ways our authorities torture is by not telling relatives where their loved ones are being held until the last 
minute,' he said. 
 - EU 'will help free my son' - 
 Protasevich's parents are in close contact with the mother of his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, a law student who was 
arrested along with him. 
 They saw clear signs of their son having been beaten in a video message released Monday by Belarusian 
authorities in which the photographer and activist supposedly confessed. 
 Dmitry said his son looked extremely nervous, appeared to be missing some teeth and had bruises on the left side 
of his face and on his neck. 
 'The video was clearly staged. It was done under pressure and it should not be believed.' 
 But, he added, 'at least it shows he is alive'. 
 Protasevich's parents moved to Poland eight months ago after being harassed during a crackdown against 
unprecedented mass protests that followed a disputed presidential election in August 2020. 
 They said their son felt safe in the European Union, first in Poland, where he moved in 2019, and then in Lithuania. 
'Please save him' plead Belarus blogger's parents
 Holidaying with his girlfriend in Greece, where his Ryanair flight left from Sunday on its way to Lithuania, his father 
said Roman 'could not have predicted such an outcome'. 
 'He was on a plane registered in an EU country and flying from an EU country to an EU country!' 
 Dmitry welcomed action taken by EU leaders at a summit this week, saying that it would 'help radically change the 
situation'. 
 'I think it will help free my son,' he said. 
 - 'A fighter for justice' - 
 Roman Protasevich, who was born a year after Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko first came to power in 
1994, began his journalism and political activism in his teens and has been arrested several times and spent weeks 
in jail. 
 'He's a fighter for justice,' his mother said. 
 She is still in disbelief that Belarusian authorities would deploy a fighter jet to force the plane her son was on to 
land. 
 'They sent a fighter jet to get this young man! It's an act of terrorism, I don't think you can call it anything else. He's 
been taken hostage. This is an act of pure revenge!' she said. 
 Her voice breaking, she added: 'My son, this young man just wanted to tell the truth about the situation. He didn't 
do anything wrong.'

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed sanctions that the European Union imposed on Belarus 
following the forced landing of a Ryanair flight.
"The forced landing of a passenger flight by Belarus was dangerous and unacceptable," he said after a meeting 
with Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas.
"This is a state hijacking and demonstrates how the regime in Minsk attacks basic democratic rights and cracks 
down on freedom of expression and independent media. I welcome the additional measures agreed by the 
European Union," he said, adding that an urgent international investigation was needed.
NATO members will meet later on Tuesday to discuss the issue.

Angela Merkel: Russian role in Belarus incident not clear

 Chancellor Angela Merkel has said questions remain about the role of Russia in the forced landing of a plane by 
Belarus. She also said a video showing arrested dissident Raman Pratasevich in custody gave rise to concern.The 
German chancellor on Tuesday said unanswered questions remained about Russia's involvement in the forced 
landing of a plane by Belarus. 
Angela Merkel said a Kremlin connection had been discussed at an EU summit focused on Minsk's diversion of a 
Ryanair flight — and the arrest of a dissident journalist on board. 
"We touched on the question of whether Russia had anything to do with it," Merkel said in Brussels after the 
summit. "We did not have any firm findings on Russia's role," she said. 
The chancellor said she would raise the issue at a future meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Merkel previously described Belarus' contention that it was simply responding to a credible security threat on board 
the plane was "completely implausible."  
Russia sides with ex-Soviet ally 
Western powers denounced Sunday's scrambling of a warplane to escort the Athens to Vilnius Ryanair passenger 
jet as "state piracy." 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described the incident as "state hijacking," and both France and Ireland 
have labeled it as piracy. Brussels responded with new sanctions on Belarus and requested EU carriers to refrain 
from flying over Belarusian airspace. 
Moscow, however, says Minsk's actions were "absolutely reasonable." 
British Foreign Minister Dominic Raab on Monday said a Russian role in the operation appeared likely. 
"It's very difficult to believe that this kind of action could have been taken without at least the acquiescence of the 
authorities in Moscow," Raab told the UK parliament. 
Kremlin denies involvement 
Russia has denied involvement and accused Western countries of hypocrisy. In particular, it noted that a Bolivian 
presidential plane was diverted to Austria in 2013 after reports that US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden was on 
board. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday claimed that anti-Russian sentiment had fueled initial allegations 
that Moscow was involved. 
Peskov also said he hoped that 26-year-old Pratasevich's girlfriend Sofia Sapega, a Russian citizen detained along 
with the Belarusian journalist, would soon be released. 
Angela Merkel: Russian role in Belarus incident not clear
Russia confirmed on Tuesday that the 23-year-old law student was being held by Belarus under suspicion of crimes 
at the time of protests in the country last year. 
Three other passengers also left the plane at Minsk on Sunday before it was allowed to proceed to the Lithuanian 
capital. Initial assertions that the three passengers had been Russian passport holders turned out to be false. 
'Naivety towards Russian relations fading' 
Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told DW that, after the EU leaders' discussions, she believed the Belarus 
incident may have helped shift EU perspectives on Russia. 'I think the naivety toward Russian relations is fading,' 
she said after talks with other EU leaders in Brussels. 
'After Belarus — where we were very united — we also had a discussion on Russia. And these two are very 
interlinked." 
"We saw that even some countries that were previously a bit skeptical regarding Russia's deeds were now very 
shocked. I think the naivety towards Russian relations is fading," Kallas said. 
Video of dissident 'concerning' 
A video emerged on Monday showing Pratasevich confessing to some accusations leveled against him, with 
apparent bruising to the face. 
In further comments after the summit, Merkel said the video was "concerning" and described the forced landing as 
"an unprecedented and unacceptable act." 
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Belarusian President Alexander Lukasahenko must pay a "bitter price" 
for detaining Pratasevich.

 After Belarus diverted a Ryanair plane and arrested a dissident blogger, the EU was quick to impose new 
sanctions on Minsk. DW takes a look at the measures and what they entail.European Union leaders called 
Sunday's military interception of a Ryanair passenger plane and the subsequent arrest of an opposition blogger a 
"hijacking," an "attack on democracy" and an "international scandal." 
After Belarusian authorities took Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, into custody, the EU was 
uncharacteristically swift to slap new sanctions on Belarus. Monday's measures included a ban on Belarusian 
airlines using EU airspace or airports.  
'Completely implausible' 
Prior to his arrest, Raman Pratasevich, a known critic of authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, was 
traveling from Greece to Lithuania. Minsk ordered the commercial plane flying over its airspace to land, claiming a 
bomb was on board — an explanation German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called "completely implausible." 
Belarusian state TV has since broadcast a video, showing Pratavesich with dark marks on his face, acknowledging 
his role in recent anti-government protests. The opposition says he was forced to film the statement.  
When EU leaders met on Monday in Brussels, they called for the immediate release of Pratasevich and his 
girlfriend. They also unanimously agreed to hold Belarus accountable.  
"Lukashenko and his regime have to understand this will have severe consequences," European Commission 
President Ursula von der Leyen said. 
But what are the consequences and what do they entail? 
Restrictions on airspace 
Since Belarus intercepted a flight between two EU countries, the 27-nation bloc also decided to hit back in the 
skies. It has banned Belarus' airlines from its airspace and airports, as well as urging EU-based plane carriers to 
avoid flying in Belarusian airspace. 
Lufthansa, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines are among the airline companies that have already 
started doing this.

 But such a move is largely symbolic and does not have any real effect on Lukashenko's politics, according to 
Dzianis Melyantsou of the Minsk Dialogue Council on International Relations.  
He says the measure could actually make Belarus more dependent on Russia as the restrictions could bankrupt the 
country's state airline — which could then be bought out by Russia. Melyantsou also observed that pro-European 
sentiment among Belarusians gets stronger the more they can travel to the EU. 
"Restrictions that isolate the Belarusian people as opposed to the Belarusian government could turn Belarusians 
against the EU," said Melyantsou. "That's why these rushed decisions won't have any effect." 
Investigation into forced plane diversion 
EU leaders called on the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to investigate the plane diversion. The 
ICAO is a specialized UN agency that can issue standards and recommendations, but does not have any regulatory 
power. 
Sanctions on individuals and businesses 
Since October 2020, the EU has progressively been restricting more and more key political figures, including 
President Alexander Lukashenko, with measures like travel bans and asset freezes. They first came as a response 
to Belarus' crackdown on peaceful protesters. 
With the arrest of Pratasevich, the bloc decided to add even more targets to its sanction list of 88 individuals and 
seven entities. 
"There will be additional sanctions on individuals that are involved in the hijacking, but this time also on businesses 
and economic entities that are financing this regime," von der Leyen told reporters. 
According to Pavel Usov, director of the Center for Political Analysis and Prognosis in Warsaw, these measures are 
necessary to signal to Lukashenko that he does not have a carte blanche to treat his citizens any way he wants. But 
in practice, they do not have much of an effect on him. 
"Lukashenko is propagating terror in his country and abroad. In reality, neither sanctions nor international 
agreements will deter him," said Usov. "They won't necessarily lead to a quick change in the country, but these 
measures are imperative." 
Billion-euro economic package is off the table 
Von der Leyen also announced that the EU has a €3 billion ($3.6 billion) investment package ready for Belarus that 
it will now freeze until the country "turns democratic."

 EU leaders are to discuss the bloc's fight against COVID-19 and climate change on day two of their summit. The 
first day saw unusually quick action taken against Belarus over the forced landing of a Ryanair flight.EU leaders are 
turning their attention to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the urgent problem of climate change on the 
second day of a special meeting of the European Council on Tuesday. 
This comes after they agreed on Monday to impose new sanctions on Belarus after Minsk forced a Ryanair 
passenger jet to land to arrest an activist journalist on board. 
What is on Tuesday's agenda? 
Although developments connected to Belarus are likely to figure largely at the leaders' talks on day two as well, the 
topic officially slated for discussion is the EU's response to COVID-19. 
The talks will focus not only on current measures to stem the spread of the illness, but also on how to counter the 
economic fallout caused by the pandemic. 
The leaders will also discuss the EU's efforts to combat climate change. 
Among other things, they will attempt to come up with guidelines to reach binding EU targets to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions. 
The bloc is aiming to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. 
What happened on Monday? 
Monday's debate was dominated by events in Belarus surrounding the forced landing of a Ryanair plane and the 
arrest of Raman Pratasevich, a government-critical journalist.  
Among other things, EU leaders called for further targeted economic sanctions on Belarus and urged all EU-based 
carriers to avoid flying through Belarusian airspace. 
They also called for the immediate release of Pratasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, a law student. 
The leaders also discussed EU-Russian relations in face of actions by Moscow that they termed "illegal, 
provocative and disruptive." 
Such actions include Russian support for an insurgency in eastern Ukraine and the poisoning and then 
imprisonment of leading opposition figure Alexei Navalny. 
At the meeting, leaders also condemned the arrest of Mali's interim President Bah N'Daw and Prime Minister 
Moctar Ouane and said the EU would consider sanctions against those obstructing the Malian transition.

We all want to get back to normal, business travellers flying around the globe securing new contracts, holiday 
makers whizzing off to sunspots and families visiting friends and relatives.
Quite when that happens remains anyone's guess but before any progress can be made airlines need to get their 
aircraft back in the skies, not an easy task and one that has seen airlines adopt very different strategies.
Following The Data - as recommended by scientists and politicians around the world we have tracked the data, well 
at least the flight status data for some of the major low-cost airlines in Europe. Over a one-week period we have 
tracked all scheduled flights operated by Ryanair, easyJet, Wizz Air and Vueling to identify the number of aircraft 
that they operated (identified by aircraft registration number) and the number of minutes they were airborne.

German airline Lufthansa says it will not fly planes through Belarusian airspace, after the forced landing of a 
Ryanair plane over the weekend and the subsequent arrest of a dissident journalist.
Flights to Moscow, among others, will have to take an alternative route, the firm said.
The airline said it had not decided whether to allow a flight from Frankfurt to Minsk scheduled for Wednesday to go 
ahead.
In Minsk on Monday, boarding for a Lufthansa flight bound for Frankfurt was stopped and all passengers had to 
undergo further security checks. Later, the flight landed in Frankfurt with a two-hour delay.
Some 339 flights pass over Belarus per day to and from Europe, according to aviation authority Eurocontrol.

May 25, 2021( EU Reporter: http://www.eureporter.co Delivered by Newstex)  
 Lukashenko's brazen interception and forced landing of a Ryanair passenger jet, in order to arrest an opposition 
activist on board, highlighted his utter disregard for the EU and its member countries, and his confidence in the 
patronage of Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
EU leaders manufactured a veneer of toughness by adopting summit conclusions calling for an array of new 
punitive measures, including economic sanctions on individuals and entities, as well as targeted sanctions that 
could hit swaths of the Belarusian economy. 
Leaders demanded the immediate release of the opposition activist, Roman Protasevich, and his companion Sofia 
Sapega, as well as an 'urgent' investigation by the International Civil Aviation Organization. 
In response to the interception of a passenger jet by Belarus, EU leaders on Monday demanded a barrage of new 
sanctions against the government of strongman Alexander Lukashenko. 
In a statement after discussions at a summit in Brussels, heads of state and government called for sanctions 
against individuals and 'entities.' They also said the Council of the European Union would adopt measures to ban 
Belarusian airlines from flying in EU airspace or accessing EU airports. 
Surprisingly, Bulgarian Prezident Radev did not take a position in the EU Council about Belarus and the 
Lukashenko plane hijack. He did not do so before, nor after, nor during the council. 
This is even more surprising as Radev is a former pilot and head of Bulgarian Air forces in NATO. 
EU politicians and ex-pat Bulgarians in Brussels find this lack of a statement by the Bulgarian president strange and 
very confusing.

The German track cycling team has withdrawn from the European Championships due to take place in Belarus after 
Minsk forced an aircraft to land there and arrested a dissident.
The German Cycling Federation (BDR) said in a statement on Tuesday it had "contacted the European Cycling 
Union (UEC) after the events of the weekend and made it clear that under these circumstances it is not possible for 
the German national track cycling team to take part."
The European Championships are scheduled for Minsk from June 23-27 but the BDR said it had urged the UEC "to 
find an alternative solution".
At a meeting in Lausanne on Thursday, the UEC will discuss whether it should relocate the championships, with 
Minsk a controversial choice even before the plane drama due to allegations long-time ruler Alexander Lukashenko 
rigged last year's election.
Belarus forced a Ryanair plane flying from Athens to Vilnius to land in Minsk on Sunday and arrested government 
critic Roman Protasevich, who had been on board.
The European Union has imposed sanctions, including a ban on Belarusian airlines landing in the EU.

 LONDON - Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said Tuesday it is clear that Raman Pratasevich, 
the journalist arrested Sunday after the passenger jet he was traveling on was diverted and forced to land in Minsk, 
has been beaten in detention. Pratasevich appeared in a video posted online Monday, apparently filmed by 
Belarusian security services. He confessed to organizing anti-government protests. His supporters say marks on his 
face show he has been beaten. Speaking from Vilnius Tuesday, where she lives in exile, Tsikhanouskaya said that 
lawyers had not been allowed to see Pratasevich. 
'I think many have already watched the video with imprisoned Raman. He said that that he is being treated lawfully 
but he is clearly beaten and under pressure. There is no doubt that he may be tortured,' Tsikhanouskaya said. 'He 
was taken hostage like 421 political prisoners, and thousands of people who have not yet been recognized as 
political prisoners but are behind bars.'   The incident has been described as 'state-sponsored hijacking' by Western 
leaders, and many European airlines are now avoiding Belarusian airspace, a key route from Europe to Asia. 
Twenty-six-year old Pratasevich was detained Sunday, after the Ryanair Boeing 737 passenger jet he was traveling 
on was forced to land in Belarus as it flew over the country en route from Greece to Lithuania. There were 171 
passengers and crew on board. Pratasevich was visiting Athens at the same time as Tsikhanouskaya, who met 
several Greek government officials.

Belarusian state media have reported that President Alexander Lukashenko personally ordered the flight to be 
intercepted. The United Nations' aviation agency, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has said the 
incident may have violated the foundational treaty governing international civil aviation, the 1944 Chicago 
Belarus Opposition Leader Alleges Journalist from Diverted Plane Beaten in Detention
Convention. Pratasevich and his Russian companion Sofia Sapega were arrested on the ground in Minsk. At least 
three other passengers also disembarked the plane and are believed to be security agents who were tracking 
Pratasevich.

photo provided by ONLINER.BY. European Union leaders expressed outrage over the incident following a summit 
in Brussels Monday evening. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission President, outlined the bloc's initial 
response. 'This is an attack on freedom of expression and this is an attack on European sovereignty. This 
outrageous behavior needs a strong answer, therefore the European Council decided that there will be additional 
sanctions on individuals that are involved in the hijacking but this time also on businesses and economic entities 
that are financing this regime,' von der Leyen said at a press conference in Brussels Monday evening. The former 
British ambassador to Belarus, Nigel Gould-Davies, welcomed the ratcheting up of sanctions against the Belarus 
government. 'I think given the escalation of Belarus' outrageous activities, the point is now to correspondingly 
escalate the sanctions and move from a situation where we're just imposing restrictions on individuals to a broader 
approach to putting pressure on the regime,' Gould-Davies told the Associated Press. 'And that means, among 
other things, going after the financial flows, the various ways in which Belarusian state companies are dependent 
on access to Western finance and Western markets. These are the money flows that help sustain the regime,' he 
added.

01/AP21026466551517.jpg?itok=UhnuZaHr FILE - Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko attends a meeting 
with top officials in Minsk, Jan. 26, 2021. The European Union urged airlines to re-route around Belarus. Lufthansa, 
KLM, SAS, Air France, LOT and Singapore Airlines were among carriers that announced they would stop flying 
over the country Tuesday. Belarusian airlines will also be banned from EU airspace and airports. However, Europe 
has limited options in seeking to retaliate, says analyst Alex Titov of Queen's University Belfast. 'Ultimately, that's 
not going to move Lukashenko, because he's got his man now,' Titov told VOA. 'The European Union in particular, 
but the United States as well, don't really want to completely antagonize Belarus or lose it altogether and push it 
into Moscow's arms.' NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg echoed the condemnation Tuesday. 'The forced 
landing of a passenger flight by Belarus was dangerous and unacceptable,' Stoltenberg told reporters. 'This is a 
state hijacking and demonstrates how the regime in Minsk attacks basic democratic rights and cracks down on 
freedom of expression and independent media. I welcome the additional measures agreed by the European Union. 
There must be an urgent international investigation. And journalist Pratasevich and his companion Sofia Sapega 
must be immediately released.' Bill Browder, the financier and political activist who has campaigned for sanctions 
against human rights abusers in Russia and elsewhere, said it is critical that the West responds forcefully. 'I think it 
sends a horrific message to every enemy of every dictatorship around the world - that you can literally be plucked 
out of the sky no matter where you are. And it's unprecedented, this type of thing, you have an internal EU flight 
that was basically grounded with fighter jets by a dictator. And there has to be harsh and serious consequences,' 
Browder said Tuesday. Pratasevich fled to Poland in 2019 and claimed political asylum. He ran the popular Nexta 
and Nexta Live channels on Telegram but recently switched to an alternative opposition social media platform. 
Since the protests began in August 2020 after a disputed election, Belarusian authorities have arrested an 
estimated 35,000 people. There is widespread evidence of torture. The operation to arrest Pratasevich was likely 
personally ordered by President Lukashenko, says analyst Alex Titov. 'The thing about the Belarusian protests is 
that there was very little structure and clear leaders and organization around them. So, the Telegram channel by 
two very young journalists in exile in Poland already suddenly became that sort of lynchpin seemingly, which was 
directing all the protests,' Titov said. U.S. President Joe Biden has asked his advisers to come up with options to 
hold those responsible for the forced landing of the Ryanair plane to be held to account. The United Nations called 
for 'a full, transparent and independent investigation.'

 Roman Protasevich pleaded with cabin crew not to land Flight 4978 in Minsk, according to Politico[1]. Passengers 
said the flight was "just minutes" from its destination when the pilot announced an emergency landing. Protasevich 
told passengers he was "facing the death penalty." See more stories on Insider's business page[2]. 
Roman Protasevich, the Belarusian journalist and activist who was detained in Minsk[3] on Sunday, pleaded with 
cabin crew not to ground the Athens-Vilnius flight in the Belarus capital, out of fear for his life, according to 
Politico[4].  
Belarusian authorities on Sunday sent a fighter jet to divert the Ryanair plane, citing a bogus bomb threat. When the 
passenger plane was forced to land in Minsk, police officers boarded the jet and arrested Protasevich and his 
girlfriend, sparking international outrage.  
Passengers on Ryanair Flight 4978 told the outlet that the plane was "just minutes" from its destination in Lithuania 
when the pilot announced the plane would make an emergency landing in Minsk.  
Initially, many of the flight's 171 passengers worried there was something wrong with the plane or the Vilnius 
airport, Politico reported. 
But Protasevich - a 26-year old dissident who has been openly critical of Belarusian President Alexander 
Lukashenko's rule - knew what was really happening, according to multiple media reports.  
Passengers on the flight told The Daily Beast[5] that as soon as Ryanair announced the diversion, Protasevich 
"immediately" opened the overhead compartment to collect his electronics, handing his laptop and phone to his 
girlfriend, Sofia Sapega.[6]  
"Behind me, a man stands up and says he wants to talk to the steward," Raselle, a Lithuanian woman who lives in 
Greece, told Politico. "He was shocked and scared." 
Protasevich then began to plead with the crew. 
"Don't do this. They will kill me," he reportedly said. "I am a refugee."  
According to eyewitnesses, a flight attendant cited "legal agreements" as the reason the plane had to land.  
Though other passengers remained mostly calm, passengers told AFP reporter Katy Lee[7] that Protasevich 
expressed fear and told other passengers he was "facing the death penalty." 
Belarusian journalist reportedly pleaded with crew before being detained in Minsk: 'Don't do this. They will kill 
me.'
"He was not screaming, but it was clear that he was very much afraid," passenger Edvinas Disma told Lee. "It 
looked like if the window had been open, he would have jumped out of it."  
Once in Minsk, authorities removed passengers from the plane in groups of five, while dogs sniffed them and their 
bags, Politico reported.  
One passenger, Saulius Danauskas, told Baltic news site Delfi[8], that he quickly realized the bomb threat had been 
a ruse.  
"When we landed people were standing around the plane doing nothing, looking pleased with themselves," 
Danauskas told the outlet. "They didn't let us out for half an hour. If there was a bomb on the plane, why would they 
not let us out?" 
Passengers told The New York Times[9] that Protasevich's luggage was checked twice before a security officer 
took him to the terminal, where he was then arrested.  
"Roman was with us and after we arrived they took him and his girlfriend," Raselle told Politico. "All very discreetly. 
He was very calm, didn't shout, he followed them, somehow accepting his destiny." 
For the next seven hours, passengers said they waited. 
"The Belarusian authorities treated us like prisoners, we were so many hours in the bus, then at the airport for 
hours without water or being able to go to the toilet, all in order to have this show that they were actually searching 
for something, when they only wanted to get the guy," Raselle told Politico. "It was a circus, a fiasco." 
Belarusian state media has reported that it was Lukashenko who gave the "unequivocal order" to ground the plane 
in Minsk. Flightradar.com data that shows the jet was closer to its destination in Lithuania than Minsk, Insider's 
Cheryl Teh reported.  
Lawyers looking to help Protasevich told The Times they believe he is being held in a jail in Minsk operated by the 
Belarusian intelligence service. 
On Monday, Belarusian authorities posted a video[10] of Protasevich, in which he said he was cooperating with 
authorities. 
The international response has been swift. On Monday, the European Union moved to isolate Belarus[11], ordering 
all EU-based airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace and banning Belarusian airlines from entering EU airspace and 
landing in its airports.  
The White House has called for an international investigation[12] into the flight's diversion and President Joe Biden 
released a statement applauding the European Union's call for economic sanctions.  
"The United States will continue to stand with the people of Belarus in their struggle," Biden said. Read the original

European Union threatened more sanctions Monday over the forced diversion of a plane to Belarus in order to 
arrest an opposition journalist. The dramatic gambit apparently ordered by the country's authoritarian president to 
suppress dissent was denounced as piracy, a hijacking and terrorism. (Euroradio via AP) 
BRUSSELS (AP) — Belarus' isolation deepened Tuesday as commercial planes avoided its airspace, the European 
Union worked up new sanctions, and a U.N. official said he was concerned for the welfare of an opposition 
journalist arrested in Minsk after being pulled off a plane that was diverted there in what the West called a state-
sponsored hijacking. 
 The dramatic arrest has put a spotlight on Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's iron-fisted rule and 
suppression of dissent — but it was not clear what effect ore sanctions or other measures would have. 
 After his detention, Raman Pratasevich was seen in a brief video clip shown on Belarusian state television late 
Monday, speaking rapidly to say that he was confessing to some of the charges authorities have leveled against 
him. The spokesperson for the U.N.'s human rights office, Rupert Colville, said Pratasevich's appearance was likely 
not voluntary and that he seemed to have bruising to his face, though it was difficult to tell from the footage. 
 The 26-year-old journalist and activist was arrested Sunday after Belarusian flight controllers ordered the Ryanair 
jetliner he was aboard to land, telling the crew that there was a bomb threat against the flight. A Belarusian fighter 
jet was scrambled to escort the plane. 
 In an unusually swift response to the arrest and flight diversion Monday, EU leaders agreed to ban Belarusian 
airlines from using the airspace and airports of the 27-nation bloc and impose sanctions on officials linked to the 
diversion.  
 They demanded Pratasevich's release and urged the International Civil Aviation Organization to start an 
investigation into the flight diversion, while recommending European carriers avoid Belarus' airspace. Polish carrier 
LOT and Baltic airlines have begun bypassing the country, while Air France, KLM, Lufthansa and others have all 
said they will follow suit.  
Belarus ' isolation grows after journalist's dramatic arrest
 Belarus has defended its actions and its Transport Ministry said Tuesday that it has invited international aviation, 
U.S. and EU authorities to investigate the flight's diversion. (Ad) It's clear that there's a giant "Green Boom Coming." 
And here's how you can get it on it... 
 In the wake of the brazen move, the country's first post-Soviet leader urged the West to introduce even tougher 
sanctions. 
 'Belarus has become a 'black hole' of Europe with repressions reaching a catastrophic scale and its dictator 
scrambling fighter jets and threatening the entire world,' Stanislav Shushkevich told The Associated Press in a 
telephone interview. 'The West must understand that only increasing pressure and really tough sanctions could 
impact Lukashenko and limit repressions.' 
 EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc will introduce additional sanctions that will target 
"businesses and economic entities that are financing this regime.'  
 'We know that in this country, the major state companies make the money. This is going to hit them and everything 
is targeted towards making them feel the sting,' said Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. 
 Lukashenko has faced unprecedented pressure at home with months of protests triggered by his reelection to a 
sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition rejected as rigged. But he has only doubled down on 
repression, and more than 35,000 people have been arrested since the protests began, and thousands beaten. 
 Some warn that more sanctions will do little to alleviate that situation and will only push Belarus even closer to its 
main sponsor and ally, Russia, and reduce the influence of the EU and others. 
 'Lukashenko will become an increasingly easy prey for the Kremlin,' said Alexander Klaskouski, an independent 
Minsk-based political analyst. 'As a pariah country, Belarus will find it much more difficult to fend off the Kremlin 
demands for the introduction of a single currency, the deployment of air bases and access to lucrative Belarusian 
economic assets.' 
 Even as the West condemned Belarus, the crackdown continued Tuesday, when Pavel Seviarynets, the leader of 
the opposition Christian-Democratic Party, was sentenced to seven years in prison on charges of organizing mass 
riots.  
 'Most leaders of Belarus' political parties have been either jailed or forced to flee the country,' said Ales Bialiatski, 
head of the Viasna human rights center. 'Belarus is facing an acute human rights crisis ... amid unprecedented 
political repressions.' 
 Pratasevich, who left Belarus in 2019, has become a top foe of Lukashenko with a popular messaging app he ran 
that played a key role in helping organize huge protests against the president, and authorities have increasingly 
tried to limit his influence.  
 The Telegram messaging app's Nexta channel that he co-founded has been labeled 'extremist' by the Belarusian 
authorities, and Stsiapan Putsila, an ally of figure who Nexta co-founder, told The AP on Tuesday that he and his 
colleagues have received 'thousands of threats' in the past to blow up their office in the Polish capital. 
 Pratasevich, meanwhile, has been charged in absentia with staging mass riots and fanning social hatred. Those 
charges carry a prison sentence of up to 15 years, and some fear Pratasevich could face more serious charges, 
including some that carry the death penalty. 
 Colville, the U.N.'s human rights office spokesperson, said that Pratasevich's brief appearance on Belarus state 
television Monday night 'was not reassuring, given the apparent bruising to his face, and the strong likelihood that 
his appearance was not voluntary and his 'confession' to serious crimes was forced.' 
 He denounced the plane's diversion as 'abuse of state power' that deserves 'the strongest condemnation.'  
 The main opposition candidate in the last election, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who left the country immediately 
after the vote under official pressure, said she urged the United States to move to suspend Belarus' membership in 
the International Civil Aviation Organization and Interpol.  
 Tsikhanouskaya also pushed for the G-7 group of leading industrialized countries to invite a Belarusian opposition 
delegation to its summit in London next month and thanked French President Emmanuel Macron for supporting her 
bid. 
 Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman, Max Blain, said, however, that "the invite list for G-7 is already set' and 
he wasn't aware of any request from the French president to invite the opposition.

7 Precious Metals Stocks That Will Keep Your Portfolio On Trend[2] The growing acceptance of cryptocurrency is 
beginning to make mainstream investors rethink their idea of 'store of value.' The trendy possibilities of Bitcoin, 
Ethereum, and any of the dozens of altcoins that exist on the blockchain are trending like the latest fashion. 
 However, the thing about fashion is that the more things change the more things stay the same. Just like the 
simple black dress that won't go out of fashion, the same can be said for precious metals stocks. One way to think 
about it would be to say that the existence of a growing cryptocurrency market doesn't change the value of precious 
metals. 
 Precious metals have long been known to be a safe-haven asset in times of market volatility and economic crisis. 
In fact, during the Covid-19 pandemic, gold prices surged about 30% breaking the $2,000 mark for the first time in 
its history. This was at a time when the prices of many cryptocurrencies were falling. 
 And precious metals have also been seen as a hedge against inflation, which seems like more of a certainty with 
the Federal Reserve's pledge to keep interest rates at historically low rates into 2023. 
 Whether you're looking to take your first steps at crafting a precious metals portfolio or if you want to fine-tune the 
one you have, we believe this special presentation is a good place to start your research. We've identified seven 
precious metals stocks that look to retain their allure in 2021.

 Top experts and officials say it's unlikely Belarus would've hijacked a flight without Russia's permission. Belarus's 
authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko relies heavily on Putin for support. Belarus is facing swift consequences 
over the incident, which could make it more reliant on Russia. See more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin likely gave Belarus the green light to force a RyanAir flight to land[2] in Minsk so 
that authorities could arrest a prominent dissident, top officials and experts say.  
Belarus's authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko is heavily reliant on Putin's support from an economic, 
military, and political standpoint. It's therefore thought to be unlikely that the Belarusian dictator would make such 
an audacious move without the Russian leader's blessing.  
British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Monday said that it was "very difficult to believe that this kind of action 
could have been taken without at least the acquiescence of the authorities in Moscow." Raab added that there was 
no firm evidence of Russia's involvement.  
"Belarus would not have hijacked an EU plane without Russian approval," Yale historian Timothy Snyder 
tweeted[3].  
As world leaders have denounced Belarus's actions as state-sanctioned hijacking, Russia has continued to offer 
Belarus support following the incident, and dismissed suspicions of its involvement as "obsessive Russophobia."[4] 
The Ryainair flight, which was en route from Greece to Lithuania, was grounded under a fake bomb threat and 
escorted into Minsk by a fighter jet. 
After the forced landing, Belarusian opposition journalist Roman Protasevich was taken into custody. Protasevich 
has been a leading critic of Lukashenko, who faced mass protests in 2020 after he won a sixth term in an election 
widely viewed as rigged. The 26-year-old dissident fled Belarus in 2019 over fear of arrest, but continued to criticize 
Lukashenko while in exile.  
As Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday condemned the Belarusian government over the "brazen and 
shocking act,"[5] Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov defended Belarus's actions as "reasonable."[6] 
Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova in a Facebook post accused Western countries of 
hypocrisy over the response. "It is shocking that the West calls the incident in Belarusian airspace 'shocking'," she 
wrote.[7] 
Putin likely gave Belarus the go-ahead to hijack the RyanAir plane, officials and experts say
Though there is suspicion of Russian involvement, the Biden administration has avoided making any explicit 
allegations. Discussing whether the US believed Russia played a role in the forced landing and arrest of 
Protasevich, White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday said, "I did not give any indication that we had 
that view yesterday, and that has not changed. We don't have a belief that that is the case."  
The White House on Tuesday announced that President Joe Biden will meet with Putin face-to-face for the first time 
since becoming commander-in-chief. Psaki during Tuesday's briefing indicated that Belarus would be discussed. -
CBS News (@CBSNews) May 25, 2021[8]  
Biden on Monday said he supported the EU's push to sanction Belarus and called for Protasevich's immediate 
release, adding that his administration would "develop appropriate options to hold accountable those responsible, in 
close coordination with the European Union, other allies and partners, and international organizations."  
Meanwhile, Putin is set to meet with Lukashenko[9] later this week in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi. 
With the EU sanctioning Belarus, barring flights over the county, and banning Belarusian airlines from using its 
airspace or airports, some analysts say that the incident has benefited Russia in the sense it's pushed Lukashenko 
even further away from the West.  
"Lukashenko will become an increasingly easy prey for the Kremlin," Alexander Klaskouski, an independent Minsk-
based political analyst, told the Associated Press[10]. "As a pariah country, Belarus will find it much more difficult to 
fend off the Kremlin demands for the introduction of a single currency, the deployment of air bases and access to 
lucrative Belarusian economic assets."

 The European Union is urging member nations to close their airspace and airports to all Belarusian airlines after 
Belarus forced a commercial jetliner to make an emergency landing Sunday in Minsk and arrested an opposition 
blogger critical of authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko.

A number of airlines, including Lufthansa, released statements earlier in the day stating they would not fly through 
Belarusian airspace. 
The EU is also calling for an investigation into the incident and is planning to sanction Belarusian officials 
responsible for the aircraft's diversion. 
Many members of the Belarusian government are already under EU sanctions because of last year's crackdown 
following the disputed August presidential election. 
The EU, as well as the United States, called on Lukashenko's government to immediately release Raman 
Pratasevich, a 26-year-old blogger who has been living in exile in Poland.

international airport outside Minsk, Belarus, May 23, 2021, in this photo released by telegram Chanel 
t.me/motolkohelp. Pratasevich, a former editor of the influential Telegram channels Nexta and Nexta Live, was 
detained by police when Belarusian authorities searched the plane. The Minsk government said Lukashenko 
ordered his military to scramble a MiG-29 fighter to escort the plane to the Minsk airport. 
In a video released on Belarusian state TV Monday, Pratasevich is seen "confessing" to charges of responsibility in 
civil disturbances.

"I can say that I have no health problems. I continue cooperating with investigators and am confessing to having 
organized mass unrest in the city of Minsk," he said. 
But just before he and his girlfriend were led off a diverted plane by police, a trembling Pratasevich reportedly told a 
fellow passenger, "I'm facing the death penalty here." 
Ryanair Flight FR4978, originating in Athens, was diverted in Belarusian airspace about 10 kilometers from Vilnius, 
Lithuania — its planned destination — because of an alleged bomb threat.

On Monday, the airline called the incident "an act of aviation piracy" and said it is cooperating with investigations 
being conducted by European Union safety and security agencies and NATO.  
In Washington, White House press secretary Jen Psaki described the Belarus government's role as "shocking" and 
said the United States is demanding an international probe of the incident. Belarus is a former Soviet republic with 
close ties to the Russian government. 
"It constitutes a brazen affront to international peace and security by the regime," Psaki said. 
A United Nations spokesman said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres supports "a full, transparent and 
independent investigation into this disturbing incident." 
A total of 126 passengers left Athens on the flight but only 121 landed in Vilnius, in addition to the crew of six. 
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary said he believed Belarusian security agents had been on the flight and had also 
disembarked in Minsk. That would seem to indicate the operation had effectively been coordinated with operatives 
on the ground in Greece.

photo provided by ONLINER.BY. The Minsk government has accused Pratasevich of terrorism and provoking riots 
after the Nexta channels became one of the main conduits for organizing last year's anti-Lukashenko protests over 
election fraud. 
Lukashenko won his sixth term in the August election, claiming 80% of the votes, although many in the country 
accused him of rigging the vote. 
During the months of protests that followed, more than 34,000 people were arrested in Belarus, and thousands 
were brutally beaten. 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday the U.S. "strongly condemns the forced diversion of a flight 
between two EU member states and the subsequent removal and arrest of journalist Raman Pratasevich in Minsk. 
We demand his immediate release. 
EU Sanctions Belarus Over Plane Diversion, Arrest of Journalist
"This shocking act perpetrated by the Lukashenko regime endangered the lives of more than 120 passengers, 
including U.S. citizens," Blinken said in his statement. 
The U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists on Sunday said it was "shocked" by the incident, saying the 
Lukashenko government "has increasingly strangled the press in Belarus for the past year, detaining, fining and 
expelling journalists, and sentencing them to longer and longer prison terms." The CPJ called for Pratasevich's 
immediate release.  
Pratasevich had been in Athens covering a visit by Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, a former Belarusian presidential 
candidate who has declared herself the country's leader-in-exile because of the alleged widespread fraud during 
last year's elections. She called on the International Civil Aviation Organization to investigate the Sunday incident 
and the diversion of the Ryanair jet.  
She tweeted that Lukashenko's "regime endangered the lives of passengers onboard the plane. From now — no 
one flying over Belarus — can be secure. International reaction needed!"

 Belarus on Sunday diverted a flight so it could arrest the dissident Roman Protasevich. Russia on Monday called it 
an "absolutely reasonable approach." The UK foreign secretary said he suspects Russian knowledge. The Kremlin 
denied involvement. See more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
Russia is the sole country standing by Belarus after it intercepted a commercial flight to detain an outspoken 
dissident[2], prompting experts and officials to suspect Moscow's involvement in the plot. 
Roman Protasevich, 26, was taken into custody on Sunday[3] after a Ryanair plane carrying him from Greece to 
Lithuania was forced to land in Belarus[4] after the pilots received a fake security report[5] from local authorities. 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said he believed KGB agents[6] were on the diverted flight. 
The UK, US[7], and the EU[8] slammed Belarus' move, calling it a violation of aviation law and human rights. 
Meanwhile, Russia has defended Belarus' actions and used it to accuse western nations of hypocrisy. 
On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that Belarus had treated the incident with an "absolutely 
reasonable approach."  
Maria Zakharova, a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, also wrote in a Facebook post[9]: "The internet 
remembers all cases of violent abductions, forced landings and illegal arrests made by 'peace officers and 
guardians of morality,'" referring to western democracies. 'Belarus would not have hijacked an EU plane without 
Russian approval' Even before Russia's show of support to Belarus, experts have suspected its involvement. 
Belarus is heavily reliant on Russia financially, with Moscow long working to lure[10] Belarus away from western 
European alliances. 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has also turned to Russian President Vladimir Putin for support in the 
past: When anti-government protests swept Belarus last fall, Lukashenko publicly asked Putin for help, and Putin 
sent support in the form of state-media journalists and surveillance resources, European intelligence sources told 
Insider at the time[11]. 
In a series of tweets Sunday[12], Timothy Snyder, a history professor at Yale University, said: "Belarus would not 
have hijacked an EU plane without Russian approval" and that "possibly the hijacking was even a Russian 
initiative." 
Russia is the only country to support Belarus after it intercepted a plane to detain a dissident. Experts have 
questioned whether Putin was involved.
In response, Nigel Gould-Davies, the former UK ambassador to Belarus, said[13] he "had no reason to believe" the 
theory that Russia orchestrated the plot, but added "that doesn't mean to say Russia doesn't approve or didn't 
assist." 
On Monday, Britain's foreign secretary also suspected Russian knowledge in the interception. 
"It's very difficult to believe that this kind of action could have been taken without at least the acquiescence of the 
authorities in Moscow," Dominic Raab said, according to Reuters [14], caveating that he didn't have "any clear 
details" on Russian involvement so far. 
Timothy Ash, a senior emerging-markets strategist at Bluebay Asset Management, also said Monday that 
Lukashenko "would not have risked his relationship with the Kremlin by undertaking such a cavalier move unless he 
had been first given the green light by Putin," CNBC reported[15]. 
Russia has denied any involvement in the interception. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday dismissed 
the idea that his country knew anything about the Belarus plot, saying that widespread anti-Russian sentiment 
meant that Russia is accused of everything these days, Reuters reported[16]. Read the original article on Business

 The forced landing of a passenger flight in Belarus and the subsequent arrest of a dissident has sparked backlash 
across 
the 
continent. 
Belarus' 
opposition 
has 
called 
for 
tougher 
measures 
against 
Lukashenko's 
government.Several European airlines announced on Tuesday that they are suspending flights over Belarus after 
Minsk forced a Ryanair jet to land to arrest a dissident journalist. 
European Union leaders had urged airlines to avoid Belarus' airspace as they imposed sanctions against the 
government of longtime leader Alexander Lukashenko. 
Western leaders accused Belarusian authorities of hijacking the passenger plane during its flight on Sunday, while 
Minsk claimed it was trying to secure the jet after receiving a bomb threat. 
Which airlines are affected? 
Air France said in a statement it had "taken note" of the conclusions of Monday's EU summit and had suspended 
flights over Belarus "until further notice." 
Finland's flag carrier Finnair and Polish airline LOT also said they would stop using Belarusian airspace. 
Germany's Lufthansa, Dutch KLM, Scandinavian SAS and Latvian Air Baltic made similar announcements on 
Monday. 
Singapore Airlines is also rerouting flights "that are bound for Europe to avoid the Belarusian airspace" and will 
continue to "closely monitor the situation," AFP news agency quoted a spokesperson as saying. 
How has the Belarusian opposition reacted? 
Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya on Tuesday called on Western leaders to ramp up 
pressure on the Belarus government. 
"The situation with the hijacking of the plane cannot be considered separately from other repressions and flagrant 
violations of human rights in Belarus," Tsikhanouskaya said. 
In a call with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Tsikhanouskaya "called on the United States to isolate the 
regime and pressure it through sanctions," she said on Twitter. 
The opposition figure also said that she asked for the Belarusian opposition to be invited to next month's G7 summit 
in Britain. 
"All of this is a result of the regime's impunity and the lack of a decisive response from the international community," 
she added. 
How have world powers responded so far? 
Belarus : European airlines halt flights amid outrage over plane arrest
The United Nations rights office demanded the immediate release of 26-year-old Raman Pratasevich, the 
Belarusian activist journalist who was detained after the plane landed on Sunday.  
"We are shocked by the unlawful arrest and arbitrary detention," spokesman Rupert Colville told reporters in 
Geneva.  
"The manner, through threat of military force, in which Protasevich was abducted from the jurisdiction of another 
state and brought within that of Belarus, was tantamount to an extraordinary rendition." 
The EU has since banned Belarusian carriers from flying over the bloc's airspace. The bloc also called for the 
release of Pratasevich.  
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed the EU sanctions, adding that the "forced landing of a 
passenger flight by Belarus was dangerous." 
US President Joe Biden said his administration was looking into "appropriate options to hold accountable those 
responsible, in close coordination with the European Union." 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel described the Belarusian government's account of the incident as "completely 
implausible." 
What has Belarus said?  
Belarus, which said it stopped the plane over a security threat, claimed Western countries were making "unfounded 
accusations" about the event for political reasons. 
On Tuesday, Belarus said it had invited European, US and international aviation officials to investigate the incident. 
Russia, an ally of Belarus, has defended Minsk's handling of the crisis.

 Belarus diverted a Ryanair plane on Sunday and arrested a critical journalist on board. Roman Protasevich often 
criticized the Belarus government and is charged with organizing protests. Belarus released a video of Protasevich 
on Monday. His father said he looked coerced and beaten up. See more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
The father of the detained journalist Roman Protasevich has said that he looked beaten up and coerced in a new 
video[2] released of him the Belarus government. 
Protasevich was taken into custody on Sunday after a Ryanair plane carrying him from Athens, Greece, to Vilnius, 
Lithuania, was forced to land in Belarus[3] after the pilots received a fake security report[4] from local authorities. 
Protasevich is one of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's most vocal critics. He had been living in Poland 
since 2019 over fears for his safety, and has continued to criticize Lukashenko from afar. Belarus accused 
Protasevich of terrorism and provoking riots last year. 
On Monday, Belarusian authorities posted a video of Protasevich[5], in which he admitted to organizing protests in 
Minsk last year. 
"Right now I continue to cooperate with police and confess to organizing mass protests," Protasevich said, Sky 
News reported[6]. He also said he was cooperating with authorities and continued to "provide evidence related to 
the mass rallies in Minsk," according to a translation by Insider. -Hanna Liubakova (@HannaLiubakova) May 24, 
2021[7] Protasevich father, Dzmitry, told Reuters on Tuesday that that confession seemed forced. 
''I think he was forced. It's not his words, it's not his intonation of speech, he is acting very reserved and you can 
see he is nervous," he said. 
"And it's not his pack of cigarettes on the table - he doesn't smoke these. So I think he was forced." 
He said: "My son cannot admit to creating the mass disorders, because he just didn't do any such thing. It's unlikely 
he went for a deal with prosecutors. I think it's just that he was forced to record the message." 
Dzmitry Protasevich went on to say that it looked as if his son had been beaten up. "It is very likely that his nose is 
broken, because the shape of it is changed," he said. 
Lukashenko's office said the president personally scrambled a MiG-29 fighter jet to escort the Ryanair plane to the 
ground on Sunday. 
The father of captured journalist Roman Protasevich said he looked forced and beaten up in his video 
confession from Belarus
In a Monday statement[8], Ryanair called the diversion "was an act of aviation piracy" and Ryanair CEO Michael 
O'Leary told an Irish radio station[9] that "the intent of the authorities was to remove a journalist." 
After the passengers were informed that plane was being diverted to Minsk on Sunday, Protasevich told fellow 
passengers that he was "facing the death penalty," the Lithuanian news site Delfi News[10] reported. 
In a video published by The Washington Post[11], one passenger identified as Mantas said that upon learning of 
the diversion, Protasevich immediately started destroying his electronic equipment. Read the original article on

May 25, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 With air-travel demand improving in the United States (particularly for leisure), Southwest Airlines LUV[1] provided 
an upbeat update on average core cash burn for the June quarter. In fact, driven by this better air-travel demand 
scenario, Alaska Air Group ALK[2] too lifted its second-quarter outlook for cash flow from operations. 
JetBlue Airways JBLU[3] was also featured in news, courtesy of its decision to start flying to London later this year. 
Meanwhile, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] announced its intention to start flights on the Teesside (United Kingdom)-
Faro (Portugal) route from Jun 16. This airline too grabbed headlines last week due to its lackluster fiscal fourth-
quarter fiscal 2021 results. The European carrier's fiscal fourth quarter were covered in detail in the previous week's 
writeup[5]. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Southwest Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank 
#3 (Hold), expects average core cash burn in the $1-$3 million band per day for the current quarter. The metric was 
$6 million a day in April. The projection is better than the previous estimate of the metric, which was in the $2-4 
million range. Notably, the average core cash burn excludes changes in working capital. The company still expects 
to achieve a breakeven average core cash flow or better in June 2021. Management further stated that operating 
revenues, which declined approximately 42% in April 2021 from its April 2019 levels, improved from the March 
reading owing to better leisure travel demand. The company is also currently witnessing improvements in travel 
demand and bookings for business[6]. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank [7](Strong Buy) [8]stocks here. 
2. JetBlue intends to start operating daily flights from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport to London's 
Heathrow Airport from Aug 11, 2021 and to London's Gatwick Airport on Sep 29, 2021. However, the airline's 
highly-awaited service between Boston Airport and London is delayed. Service on that route will commence in 
summer 2022[9]. 
3. Management at Alaska Air expects cash flow from operations for the June quarter in the $550-$650 million 
range. This represents an improvement from the previous expectation in the $450-$550 million band. Further, 
management stated that better-than-expected cash inflows from the carrier's affinity card partner and its receipt of 
additional funds, courtesy of the second round of the Payroll Support Program, also contributed to this bullish cash 
flow projection. However, the company still expects second-quarter 2021 revenues to decline in the 32-37% band 
from the figure reported in second-quarter 2019. Capacity projection for the June quarter is also reaffirmed at a 
Airline Stock Roundup: LUV Gives Bullish Cash Burn Q2 Update, ALK , JBLU in Focus
roughly 20% decline from its second-quarter 2019 actuals. Load factor view (% of seats filled with passengers) is 
retained in the 70-75% band. 
4.Following the United Kingdom's green list announcement, which allows England residents to visit certain 
countries (including Portugal) without having to quarantine on their return, Ryanair aims to start operating flights 
from Teesside to Faro, Portugal as part of its UK Summer 2021 Schedule. From Teesside, the carrier intends to 
begin services to Alicante and Palma de Mallorca in Spain this June, and to Corfu, Greece in July.[10] 
5. Delta Air Lines DAL[11] expands operation to Iceland with a second flight launched recently, which connects 
Boston, MA with Reykjavik. Earlier this month, the airline resumed its daily service to Iceland from New York-JFK 
after the country reopened its borders to U.S. travelers. 
Amy Martin, Delta's managing director, International Network Planning, stated, 'As the first European country to 
reopen to U.S. tourists, we've seen increased demand for travel to Iceland this summer versus 2019.' In response 
to this demand uptick, the carrier will begin a third flight to Iceland from Minneapolis, MN this week[12]. 
Performance The following table shows the price movement of major airline players over the past week and during 
the last six months. 
The table above shows that most airline stocks have traded in the green in the past week (although the gains were 
muted in nature), leading the NYSE ARCA Airline Index to gain marginally over the past week. Over the course of 
the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has appreciated 30%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Stay

 In this handout photo released by European Radio for Belarus, Belarus journalist Raman Pratasevich poses for a 
photo in front of euroradio.fm sign in Minsk, Belarus, Sunday, Nov. 17, 2019. Western outrage grew and the 
European Union threatened more sanctions Monday over the forced diversion of a plane to Belarus in order to 
arrest an opposition journalist. The dramatic gambit apparently ordered by the country's authoritarian president to 
suppress dissent was denounced as piracy, a hijacking and terrorism. (Euroradio via AP) 
MOSCOW (AP) — European airlines were skirting Belarus on Tuesday after the European Union urged them to do 
so while imposing new sanctions against the ex-Soviet nation to punish it for the forced diversion of a passenger jet 
to arrest an opposition journalist. 
 The brazen move, apparently ordered by Belarus' authoritarian president, elicited widespread shock and fury, and 
EU leaders took unusually swift action in response at a summit Monday. They agreed to ban Belarusian airlines 
from using the airspace and airports of the 27-nation bloc, imposed sanctions on officials linked to Sunday's flight 
diversion, and urged the International Civil Aviation Organization to start an investigation into the episode some 
described as state terrorism or piracy.  
 They also demanded the immediate release of the journalist, Raman Pratasevich, a top foe of Belarusian President 
Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled the country with an iron fist for over a quarter-century. 
 Pratasevich was detained Sunday after Belarusian flight controllers told the crew of a Ryanair jetliner he was 
aboard that there was a bomb threat against the flight and ordered it to land. A Belarusian MiG-29 fighter jet was 
scrambled to escort the plane. 
 Belarus has defended its actions and its Transport Ministry said Tuesday that it has invited representatives of the 
international aviation organization and U.S. and EU authorities to investigate the flight's diversion. 
 Polish carrier LOT and Baltic airlines have begun bypassing Belarus. Air France, KLM, Finnair, Lufthansa and 
Austrian Airlines have all said they will also avoid flights over the country. The U.K., which is no longer part of the 
EU, also recommended that carriers don't fly over Belarus, and British Airways flights were avoiding the country. 
 In a sign that tensions remained high, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described the Ryanair flight's 
diversion as 'dangerous and unacceptable' and welcomed the EU response. 'This is a state hijacking and 
demonstrates how the regime in Minsk attacks basic democratic rights and cracks down on freedom of expression 
European planes skirt Belarus amid fury at journalist arrest
and independent media,' Stoltenberg said. (Ad) Newly acquired key lithium properties may turn this explorer into the 
next lithium giant! 
 The 30-nation military organization's ambassadors are meeting later Tuesday and will discuss the episode.  
 Pratasevich, a 26-year-old journalist and activist, was arrested along with his Russian girlfriend, Sofia Sapega. He 
was later seen in a brief video clip shown on Belarusian state television, speaking rapidly and saying that he was 
giving testimony about organizing mass disturbances. 
 The spokesperson for the U.N.'s human rights office denounced the plane's diversion as 'abuse of state power' that 
deserves 'the strongest condemnation.' Rupert Colville said that Pratasevich's brief appearance on Belarus state 
television Monday night 'was not reassuring, given the apparent bruising to his face, and the strong likelihood that 
his appearance was not voluntary and his 'confession' to serious crimes was forced.' 
 'This astonishing episode constitutes a new phase in the Belarusian authorities campaign of repression against 
journalists and civil society in general,' Colville said.  
 Pratasevich, who left Belarus in 2019 and ran a popular messaging app that played a key role in helping organize 
huge protests against Lukashenko, has been charged in absentia with staging mass riots and fanning social hatred. 
Those charges carry a prison sentence of up to 15 years.  
 The Telegram messaging app's Nexta channel that he co-founded has been labeled 'extremist' by the Belarusian 
authorities, and some fear Pratasevich could face more serious charges, including some that carry the death 
penalty. 
 Speaking to The Associated Press in Warsaw, Stsiapan Putsila, another Nexta co-founder, said he and his 
colleagues have received 'thousands of threats' in the past to blow up their office in the Polish capital. He added 
that following Pratasevich's arrest, they have received a flow of new threats 'that we are the next, that we will not be 
even taken to Belarus but will be executed right away, that our office will be blown up and we have to be afraid.' 
 Putsila said that the group relies on police protection and undertake "all the possible safety measures to minimize 
threats and carry out our everyday work.' 
 Belarus has been rocked by months of protests, which were triggered by Lukashenko's reelection to a sixth term in 
an August 2020 vote that the opposition rejected as rigged. More than 34,000 people have been arrested in Belarus 
since then, and thousands beaten. 
 U.S. President Joe Biden said late Monday that he asked his team to develop appropriate options to hold 
accountable those responsible, in close coordination with the European Union, other allies and partners, and 
international organizations. 
 'This outrageous incident and the video Mr. Pratasevich appears to have made under duress are shameful 
assaults on both political dissent and the freedom of the press," Biden's statement said.

7 Hotel Stocks Just Waiting For the Vaccine[2] Like any group of stocks related to travel and tourism, hotel stocks 
saw a steep drop in share prices in 2020. The leisure and hospitality sector that once had 15 million employees has 
lost 4 million jobs since February. 
 Many major cities will be feeling the ripple effects of the Covid-19 pandemic for years. However, there is ample 
evidence that shows the pandemic may be coming to an end. The number of new cases is dropping. The number of 
those getting vaccinated is rising. And even in the cities with the most restrictive mitigation measures, the slow 
process of reopening is beginning. 
 All of this can't come fast enough for individuals who rely on the travel and tourism industry for their livelihood. 
Hotel chains had at least some revenue coming in the door. And when earnings season concludes, the more 
budget-friendly hotel chains may realize revenue that is 75% of its 2019 numbers. But that is not enough to bring 
the hotels to anywhere near full employment. Particularly with hotels that have bars and restaurants that have 
remained closed or open at limited capacity. 
 Many economists are optimistic that travel may begin to look more normal by the summer of this year. And the 
global economy may deliver 6.4% GDP growth this year. With that in mind, the hotel chains with the best 
fundamentals and the broadest footprint will be in the best position as the economy reopens.

MOSCOW (AP) — Belarus' isolation deepened Tuesday as commercial planes avoided its airspace, the European 
Union worked up new sanctions, and a senior U.N. official said he was concerned for the welfare of an opposition 
journalist arrested in Minsk after his plane was diverted there, apparently on the orders of the country's longtime 
strongman. 
 After his detention, Raman Pratasevich was seen in a brief video clip shown on Belarusian state television late 
Monday, speaking rapidly to say that he was confessing to some of the charges authorities have leveled against 
him. The spokesperson for the U.N.'s human rights office, Rupert Colville, said Pratasevich's appearance was likely 
not voluntary and that he seemed to have bruising to his face, though it was difficult to tell from the footage. 
 The 26-year-old journalist and activist was arrested Sunday after Belarusian flight controllers told the crew of a 
Ryanair jetliner he was aboard that there was a bomb threat against the flight and ordered it to land. A Belarusian

27-nation bloc, imposed sanctions on officials linked to Sunday's flight diversion, and urged the International Civil 
Aviation Organization to start an investigation into the episode some described as state terrorism or piracy.  
 They demanded Pratasevich's release and urged European carriers to avoid Belarus' airspace. Polish carrier LOT 
and Baltic airlines have begun bypassing Belarus. Air France, KLM, Finnair, Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines have 
all said they will also avoid flights over the country. The U.K., which is no longer part of the EU, also recommended 
that carriers don't fly over Belarus, and British Airways flights were avoiding the country. (Ad) The second

(And avoid a costly mistake) 
Belarus' isolation deepens as flights avoid its airspace
 Belarus has defended its actions and its Transport Ministry said Tuesday that it has invited representatives of the 
international aviation organization and U.S. and EU authorities to investigate the flight's diversion. 
 In a sign that tensions remained high, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described the Ryanair flight's 
diversion as 'dangerous and unacceptable' and welcomed the EU response. 'This is a state hijacking and 
demonstrates how the regime in Minsk attacks basic democratic rights and cracks down on freedom of expression 
and independent media,' Stoltenberg said.  
 The 30-nation military organization's ambassadors are meeting later Tuesday and will discuss the episode.  
 Pratasevich, who was arrested along with his Russian girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, was later seen in a brief video clip 
shown on Belarusian state television, saying he was giving evidence to investigators about his organization of mass 
disturbances. 
 Colville, the U.N.'s human rights office spokesperson, denounced the plane's diversion as 'abuse of state power' 
that deserves 'the strongest condemnation.' He said that Pratasevich's brief appearance on Belarus state television 
Monday night 'was not reassuring, given the apparent bruising to his face, and the strong likelihood that his 
appearance was not voluntary and his 'confession' to serious crimes was forced.' 
 'This astonishing episode constitutes a new phase in the Belarusian authorities campaign of repression against 
journalists and civil society in general,' Colville said.  
 Pratasevich, who left Belarus in 2019 and ran a popular messaging app that played a key role in helping organize 
huge protests against Lukashenko, has been charged in absentia with staging mass riots and fanning social hatred. 
Those charges carry a prison sentence of up to 15 years.  
 The Telegram messaging app's Nexta channel that he co-founded has been labeled 'extremist' by the Belarusian 
authorities, and some fear Pratasevich could face more serious charges, including some that carry the death 
penalty. 
 Speaking to The Associated Press in Warsaw, Stsiapan Putsila, another Nexta co-founder, said he and his 
colleagues have received 'thousands of threats' in the past to blow up their office in the Polish capital. He added 
that following Pratasevich's arrest, they have received a flow of new threats 'that we are the next, that we will not be 
even taken to Belarus but will be executed right away, that our office will be blown up and we have to be afraid.' 
 Putsila said that the group relies on police protection and undertake "all the possible safety measures to minimize 
threats and carry out our everyday work.' 
 Belarus has been rocked by months of protests, which were triggered by Lukashenko's reelection to a sixth term in 
an August 2020 vote that the opposition rejected as rigged. More than 34,000 people have been arrested in Belarus 
since then, and thousands beaten. 
 U.S. President Joe Biden said late Monday that he asked his team to develop appropriate options to hold 
accountable those responsible, in close coordination with the European Union, other allies and partners, and 
international organizations. 
 'This outrageous incident and the video Mr. Pratasevich appears to have made under duress are shameful 
assaults on both political dissent and the freedom of the press," Biden's statement said.

Featured Article: What is the return on assets (ROA) ratio?[1] 
7 Healthcare Stocks Delivering Innovation in 2021[2] We all knew that traditional healthcare services were disrupted 
in 2020. The patient-doctor relationship went virtual. In the early months of the pandemic, many people in need of 
elective surgeries simply did not have that option available to them. And even local pharmacies took on a new e-
commerce role as curbside pickup or home delivery of prescription medication became the norm. 
 Not surprisingly healthcare stocks were battered last year. Overall, the sector was down 11%, far below the 
S&#38;P 500 Index that climbed over 15%. 
 However, the market is always forward-looking with a particular eye towards innovation. The healthcare sector has 
many companies that are developing innovative approaches in areas such as gene editing. And other companies 
are in late-stage trials for drugs that can deliver breakthrough results for conditions that continue to plague our 
world. 
 That's the focus of this presentation. We've identified 7 healthcare stocks that are delivering innovative ideas that 
will help deliver better patient outcomes. And in some cases will revolutionize medicine altogether. These are also 
the stocks that analysts have their eye on.

 I hate to have to belabor the obvious, but having seen first hand how shallow the notion of freedom of the press is 
in the US,1 it is instructive to watch the hissy fit and rapid moves to inflict punishment on Belarus for crimes against 
journalists (or rather a journalist) and forcing a passenger plane in its airspace to land. This story is the lead item in 
the Financial Times: 
And getting plenty of attention in other major platforms: 
European Union leaders have agreed on new sanctions against Belarus, including a ban on the use of EU airspace 
and airports, over its forced diversion of a plane to the capital of Minsk in order to arrest an opposition journalist. 
https://t.co/7EDDhdc7sf[1] 
 — The Associated Press (@AP) May 24, 2021[2] 
Needless to say, this reaction came with impressive speed. By contrast, there admittedly was some consternation 
(or was it morbid interest?) about the butchering of Jamal Khashoggi, but no rush to impose sanctions, even though 
it was widely believed that Mohammed bin Salman authorized Khashoggi's execution. 
Muhammad bin Salman used a bonesaw to silence Jamal #Khashoggi[3] while #Erdogan[4] used his police to 
silence Faruk Omar #Gergerlioğlu[5] but make no mistake both Khashoggi and Gergerlioğlu were SILENCED!

The Saudis also threatened UN investigator Agns Callamard[10]. 
 Mind you, we are not saying the Belarus government is a nice lot. They did force a Ryanair flight from Athens to 
Vilinus carrying opposition leader/journalist Roman Protasevich and his partner Sofia Sapega to land. The pink 
paper suggests that Protasevich has been roughed up: 
West's Selective Support for Press Freedom: Only in Countries We Don't Like
 A pro-Lukashenko channel on the messaging app Telegram published the first footage of Protasevich since his 
arrest as the EU leaders were meeting. The activist appeared disheveled and said he was in a jail in Minsk but 
claimed he was being treated well, despite the bruises visible on his face. 
 'I am also co-operating with the investigation and giving evidence of my guilt in organising mass disturbances,' he 
said. He faces 15 years in prison on the charges. 
 The US is apparently too convinced of its moral purity to see that we are in pot calling the kettle black mode. Our 
government is determined that Julian Assange rot in a dank pit for his sin of posting footage that showed US armed 
forces perpetrating a war crime. It's one thing to hear allegations, quite another to have the goods. That was 
compounded by his later sin of publishing allegedly hacked documents that Hillary Clinton believes were the fruit of 
Russian dastardliness and cost her the 2016 election.  
 Independent parties have no trouble seeing what is going on: 
Exactly, Assange is guilty of journalism and truth. 
 — PaulShilly (@shillcock_paul) April 11, 2019[11] 
And that's before getting to Assange having been a de facto prisoner in the Ecuadorian embassy for seven years, 
at a cost to his health, before being incarcerated in the UK, largely in punitive solitary confinement while awaiting 
trial, then being given the Hannibal Lecter treatment in court. This is the lot that sees fit to judge other countries on 
how they treat dissidents? 
 Glenn Greenwald is all over another layer of this hypocrisy, the consternation over the diversion of the Ryanair 
flight. As he points out in As Anger Toward Belarus Mounts, Recall the 2013 Forced Landing of Bolivia's Plane to 
Find Snowden[12]: 
 U.S . and E.U. governments are expressing outrage today over the forced landing by Belarus of a passenger jet 
flying over its airspace on its way to Lithuania. The Ryanair commercial jet, which took off from Athens and was 
carrying 171 passengers, was just a few miles from the Lithuanian border when a Belarusian MiG-29 fighter jet 
ordered the plane to make a U-turn and land in Minsk, the nation's capital 
 [Belarus' long-time authoritarian leader Aleksandr] Lukashenko's own press service said the fighter jet was 
deployed on orders of the leader himself, telling the Ryanair pilot that they believed there was a bomb or other 
threat to the plane on board. When the plane landed in Minsk, an hours-long search was conducted and found no 
bomb or any other instrument that could endanger the plane's safety, and the plane was then permitted to take off 
and land thirty minutes later at its intended destination in Lithuania. But two passengers were missing. Protasevich 
was quickly detained after the plane was forced to land in Minsk and is now in a Belarusian jail, where he faces a 
possible death sentence as a 'terrorist' and/or a lengthy prison term for his alleged national security crimes. His 
girlfriend, traveling with him, was also detained despite facing no charges. 
 There is little doubt that the forced landing of this plane by Belarus, with the clear intention to arrest Protasevich, is 
illegal under numerous conventions and treaties governing air space. Any forced landing of a jet carries 
dangersThis act by Belarus merits all the condemnation it is receiving. 
 Yet news accounts in the West which are depicting this incident as some sort of unprecedented assault on legal 
conventions governing air travel and basic decency observed by law-abiding nations are whitewashing history. 
Attempts from U.S. officials such as Blinken and E.U. bureaucrats in Brussels to cast the Belarusians' behavior as 
some sort of rogue deviation unthinkable for any law-respecting democracy are particularly galling and deceitful. 
 In 2013, the U.S. and key E.U. states pioneered the tactic just used by Lukashenko. They did so as part of a failed 
scheme to detain and arrest the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. That incident at the time caused global 
shock and outrage precisely because, eight years ago, it was truly an unprecedented assault on the values and 
conventions they are now invoking to condemn Belarus. 
Please read Greenwald's account in full. He gives a detailed history of the disgraceful diversion and 12 hour seizure 
of the plane of Bolivian president Evo Morales, including Morales himself. Morales had made the mistake, during an 
official visit to Russia, of saying Bolivia would be willing to give Edward Snowden asylum during the time when 
Snowden was holed up in the international transit zone in Moscow. Morales' jet was forced to divert not due to 
interception by a military plane, but by EU nations on its flight path revoking its right to use their air space. The 
West's Selective Support for Press Freedom: Only in Countries We Don't Like
presidential plane was forced to backtrack and make an unscheduled landing in Vienna, where it was boarded in 
violation of international law. He concludes: 
 None of what happened with this Morales incident has any bearing on the justifiability of what Belarus did on 
Sunday. That the U.S. and its E.U. allies committed a dangerous international crime in 2013 does not mitigate the 
criminal nature of similar actions by Belarus or any other country eight years later. The dangers of forcing down 
airplanes in order to arrest someone who is suspected to be on that plane are manifest. The danger increases, not 
decreases, as more countries do it. 
 But no journalist, especially Western ones, should be publishing articles or broadcasting stories falsely depicting 
Sunday's incident as an unprecedented assault that could be perpetrated only by a Russian-allied autocrat. The 
tactic was pioneered by the very countries who today are most vocally condemning what happened.  
 More incisive comments: 
Western media solidarity against official Nato enemy Belarus in sharp contrast to media solidarity— with Nato ally 
Israel, and against AP journalists—after IDF deliberately bombed Gaza media center to 'vent its frustrations'. This 
isn't amnesia, this is fucking dementia. 
 — Mark Ames (@MarkAmesExiled) May 24, 2021[13] 
And finally, from Craig Murray[14]: 
 The USA, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Austria combined to force down President Eva Morales' jet in Vienna 
in 2013 after the CIA falsely reported whistleblower Edward Snowden was on board. The monumental cynicism of 
these nations in sanctioning Belarus for a directly comparable action is sickening, even by the standards of western 
hypocrisy. Indeed, to force down a Presidential jet covered by diplomatic immunity is a greater offence to 
international law than Belarus forcing down the Ryanair flight. 
 Both actions are wrong. You will excuse me also for pointing out that there is no sanction on Israel for targeting 
over 30 news organisations in Gaza and bombing them. 
 Perhaps I might go still further and mention that as I am about to go to jail for dissident blogging, I see the western 
powers as having limited moral authority to complain of Belarus jailing dissident bloggers? 
 This is not the behavior of confident leaders. Sadly, we have found you don't even have to rise to the status of 
being a dissident blogger to get on an official enemies' list.2

European Union threatened more sanctions Monday over the forced diversion of a plane to Belarus in order to

suppress dissent was denounced as piracy, a hijacking and terrorism. (Euroradio via AP) 
MOSCOW (AP) — European airlines began skirting Belarus on Tuesday at the urging of the European Union, 
which also imposed new sanctions to punish the ex-Soviet nation's forced diversion of a passenger jet to arrest an 
opposition journalist. 
 In unusually swift action at a summit in Brussels, EU leaders agreed Monday to ban Belarusian airlines from using 
the airspace and airports of the 27-nation bloc, imposed sanctions on officials linked to Sunday's flight diversion, 
and urged the International Civil Aviation Organization to start an investigation into the episode some described as 
state terrorism or piracy.  
 On Sunday, Belarusian flight controllers told the crew of a Ryanair jetliner flying from Greece to Lithuania that there 
was a bomb threat against the plane as it was crossing through Belarus airspace and ordered it to land. A 
Belarusian MiG-29 fighter jet was scrambled to escort the plane in a brazen show of force by President Alexander 
Lukashenko, who has ruled the country with an iron fist for over a quarter-century. 
 Belarus authorities then arrested 26-year-old journalist and activist Raman Pratasevich and his Russian girlfriend, 
Sofia Sapega. Pratasevich was later seen in a brief video clip shown on Belarusian state television, speaking 
quickly and saying that he was giving testimony about organizing mass disturbances. 
 Pratasevich, who left Belarus in 2019 and ran a popular messaging app that played a key role in helping organize 
huge protests against Lukashenko, has been charged in absentia with staging mass riots and fanning social hatred.

7 Stocks That Still Have Upside For Investors to Buy[2] It can be fun to invest in some speculative stocks. But it 
should go without saying that those stocks shouldn't make up the bulk of your portfolio. In fact, it's important to find 
a few good stocks that make up the base of your portfolio. These are momentum stocks that are in a strong 
uptrend. 
 One way to find such stocks is to look at the most active stocks (or volume leaders). Shares of these companies 
are among the most traded or have the highest dollar volume of shares traded in a given trading day. 
 Any stock may crack this list from time to time (for example, when there's new news about the company). However, 
stocks tend to find their way on this list consistently that bear watching. That's because this list indicates that there 
is pressure among investors to buy or sell the stock. And that makes an investor's decision very simple. 
 And that's the reason we created this special presentation. The stocks on this list are among the most actively 
traded stocks on the market today. They also share a similar quality. They are coming off strong years in 2020 and 
seem to be showing some consolidation for another leg up.

 WASHINGTON - Airlines re-routed flights to avoid Belarusian airspace Tuesday in the aftermath of the Minsk 
government forcing down a passenger jet and arresting an opposition blogger critical of authoritarian President 
Alexander Lukashenko. 
Lufthansa, KLM, SAS, Air France, LOT and Singapore Airlines were among carriers that stopped flying over 
Belarus along a major Europe-to-Asia corridor that generates hard currency payments to the Minsk government, 
$300 to $940 per flight. 
Belgium's Charles Michel, who chairs European Union summits, called the flight bans, "Europe in action," tweeting 
a picture of a flight tracker map showing no planes flying over Belarus. 
Belarusian planes also faced a possible ban from flying to European Union cities, which could leave landlocked 
Belarus only able to reach its territory via its eastern border with its close ally Russia.

FR4978 on May 23, 2021 on its way from Athens, Greece to Lithuanian capital Vilnius and diverted to Minsk, 
Belarus. (Courtesy: FLIGHTRADAR24.COM/Handout) Lukashenko used the purported threat of a bomb Sunday 
aboard a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius, Lithuania, to force the jetliner to land in Minsk. Belarusian authorities 
then arrested blogger Raman Pratasevich, accusing him of inciting massive rallies last summer against 
Lukashenko's assertion of a landslide victory in last August's election, in which he won a sixth term as the country's 
leader with a claimed 80% of the vote. 
A video released overnight showed the 26-year-old Pratasevich confessing to having organized anti-government 
demonstrations. 
Airlines Avoid Belarusian Airspace over Plane Diversion, Arrest of Journalist
"I can state that I don't have any health issues, including diseases of the heart or any other organs. Police officers 
are treating me properly and according to the law," he says, adding that he had "confessed to organizing mass 
protests in Minsk." 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the video "concerning" and described the forced landing of the passenger 
jet as "an unprecedented and unacceptable act." 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, among other world leaders, called the incident "state hijacking," and 
France and Ireland have described it as piracy. 
"If we let this go, tomorrow Alexander Lukashenko will go further and do something even more arrogant, more 
cruel," Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a statement. 
Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said the video of Pratasevich showed he had been 
tortured. 
"He said that he was treated lawfully, but he's clearly beaten and under pressure. There is no doubt that he was 
tortured. He was taken hostage," she told a news conference in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. 
 Sorry, but your browser cannot support embedded video of this type, you can download this video[1] to view it

Belarus did not immediately comment on her allegation but has consistently denied abusing the thousands of 
people it has detained. 
Human rights groups have cited hundreds of instances of what they contend are abuse and forced confessions 
resulting from a crackdown on pro-democracy opponents of Lukashenko since last year. 
"The events of Sunday are just another escalation in the strategy of blind repression led by the regime of Mr. 
Lukashenko," French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told the French parliament. 
The EU, as well as the United States, called on Lukashenko's government to immediately release Pratasevich.

May 25, 2021( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; 
 Two US Senators sent a letter Monday urging President Joe Biden to prohibit US flights over Belarus. The request 
comes after Belarus arrested Roman Protasevich after forcing the flight he was on to land. The letter was signed by 
Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat, and Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican. See more stories on Insider's business 
page[1]. 
The "state-sponsored hijacking" of a civilian flight in order to arrest a dissident activist should prompt President Joe 
Biden to ban US airlines from flying over Belarus, two US senators said in a letter on Monday. 
Over the weekend, authorities in Belarus forced the landing of a Ryanair flight - sending up a fighter jet and claiming 
a possible terrorist threat - in order to arrest Roman Protasevich[2], a 26-year-old journalist and critic of the 
authoritarian regime led by President Alexander Lukashenko. Belarusian authorities have since posted a video of 
Protasevich[3] that his allies say appears to have been delivered under duress[4], Reuters reported. 
President Biden condemned the arrest in a statement Monday evening, calling it "a direct affront to international 
norms." Biden said he asked advisers "to develop appropriate options to hold accountable those responsible." 
In the meantime, Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, and Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, 
want the president to keep US flights away from Eastern European nation. 
"In an effort to keep passengers and crew safe, we urge you to prohibit all US airlines from entering Belarusian 
airspace," they wrote in a joint missive[5]. The US has imposed a similar prohibition on flights over North Korea, the 
senators note. "We must protect innocent passengers from despotic regimes and stand in solidarity with dissidents 
who are being targeted." 
President Alexander Lukashenko, who has led Belarus since 1994, was ostensibly reelected last year. But that vote 
has been widely criticized as fraudulent, with the European Union refusing to recognize the results. 
The vote was followed by widespread protests in Belarus that were brutally repressed, with authorities detaining 
thousands, "many of them tortured or otherwise ill-treated," according to Amnesty International. Belarus accuses 
Protasevich of orchestrating the protests to overthrow the government.

 By EU vs Disinfo[1] 
Pro-Kremlin media have mobilised a common - and flawed - instrument. In literature on Ethics, it's referred to as the 
'Golden Rationalisation[2]' - the notion that an unethical or criminal act is supposed to be less unethical or criminal if 
'everybody does it'. If others lie, steal, or cheat - why shouldn't I be allowed to do it? 
On 23 May, a Belarusian fighter jet intercepted Ryanair flight FR4987 en route from Athens to Vilnius. The Minsk Air 
Control reported a bomb on board the aircraft and demanded the flight redirected to Minsk. As the plane landed, a 
dissident journalist wanted by the Belarusian authorities for 'extremism' was detained. No bombs were found. In the 
afternoon 24 May,Belarusian authorities claimed[3]that the Palestinian terrorist organisation Hamas had organised 
the bomb threat, allegedly to force the EU to demand an Israeli cease-fire in Gaza. This came several days after a 
cease-fire hadalready been negotiated[4]. 
This incident drew virtually unanimous international condemnation. Michael O'Leary, CEO of Ireland-based Ryanair, 
describes the incident as 'state-sponsored hijacking[5]'. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney calls it 'aviation-piracy 
that is state-sponsored[6]'. Most of the passengers on board the aircraft were Lithuanians, and Lithuanian 
authorities are currently investigating the incident as an 'act of terrorism[7]'. 
Pro-Kremlin media suggest that 'everybody' forces down passenger liners with fighter jets. Russia's Foreign 
Ministry spokespersonMaria Zakharova[8]asks the West not to apply 'double standards' to Belarus, aseverybody 
does it! Her boss, Foreign MinisterSergey Lavrov[9], follows the same talking points:everybody does it!: 
The most famous episode was in 2013, when Austria, after demands from the US, forced the airplane of the 
President of Bolivia to land, without giving any excuses. Less known is the incident in 2016, when an aircraft of the 
Belarusian airlines was forced to land in Kyiv, as Ukrainian Security Service was interested in an Armenian citizen 
on board the flight. He was 'taken off the flight', and the plane could depart. No apologies followed. 
Everybody Does It!
Here one must correct Mr Lavrov: The president of Ukraineactually apologised[10]for the incident and offered 
financial compensation to the airline. 
According to TheWashington Post[11], none of the examples cited by Ms Zakharova and others involved bomb 
scares or crackdowns on the political opposition. 
State News AgencyRIA Novosti suggests[12]that hijacking civilian aircraft is usual practice for security services 
everywhere/globally.Everybody does it!The agency forgets to mention that in the Ryanair case, the passenger 
plane was intercepted by a MiG-29 fighter jet belonging to the Belarusian Airforce, armed with air-to-air missiles. 
Overall, the pro-Kremlin ecosystem has quickly adopted to the 'Everybody does it'defence. The narrative is 
repeated inEnglish[13],German[14],Spanish[15],Arabic[16]; we read the same lines in pro-Kremlin media 
ofAzerbaijan[17],Georgia[18],Ukraine[19]andSerbia[20]. Everybody does the 'Everybody does it'. 
Kremlin-managed social media messaging is a little more diverse. RT editor-in-chief-Margarita Simonyanpraises 
Lukashenko's decision to use fighter jets against civilian aircraft.[21]Similar praise is relayed in Telegram channels 
sympathetic (and quite likely linked) toBelarusian authorities[22]. 
 What else does everybody do? 
 Sadly, this is not the first instance when the 'Everybody does it!' defence is invoked. The EUvsDisinfo database on 
disinformation contains a number of examples illustrating this line of conduct. According to the distorted logic of pro-
Kremlin, it was OK to illegallyannex Crimea[23], because the West recognised Kosovo.Russian violence against 
street protests is OK[24]because there have been isolated instances of violence in street protests in 
Europe.Russian doping is OK[25]because all countries use doping 
Justifying theft, violence, or drugs with the argument that 'everybody does it' is no defence. The annexation of 
Crimea is a widely recognized violation of international law; the Russian police' hard-handed crackdown on 
demonstrations in January 2021 was a violation of Russian law, and doping is simply cheating, which is punishable 
by international sports authorities. Whether or not others have violated the same laws is irrelevant.

 Lukashenko has ruled the eastern European country of Belarus for over 26 years. In 2020, he rigged an election 
and declared that he won 80% of the vote, naming himself president for a sixth term. This week, he grounded a 
passenger plane in order to detain journalist Roman Protasevich. See more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
A dramatic series of events involving a Ryanair passenger jet being diverted and forced to land in Minsk[2] 
prompted an international outcry after it was revealed that the bomb threat that grounded the plan was simply a 
ruse to arrest journalist Roman Protasevich.[3] 
Protasevich, 26, is the co-founder and editor-in-chief of NEXTA, a news channel based in Poland[4] that spread 
clips of mass protests against Lukashenko via encrypted messaging app Telegram. He is a vocal opponent of 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and was in exile in the neighboring country of Lithuania[5] until he and 
his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega[6], were dragged off the Ryanair plane and detained.[7] 
The move drew condemnation from world leaders - including the US.[8] According to CNN[9], the European Union 
has sanctioned Belarus and will be calling on all EU airlines to not fly over the country. European Commission 
President Ursula von der Leyen added on Monday that further economic sanctions on the country would be put in 
place soon.  
But the root of the drama swirling around the Eastern European country lies in Lukashenko himself. The 66-year-old 
has kept a firm grip on power in Belarus for over 26 years - and has no qualms about enraging the international 
community just to detain one activist. A strongman with a military background and Russian ties The story of 
Lukashenko's rise to power in Belarus begins in 1990. Then, he was in his late 30s and was a promising young 
military man who just won an election to a parliamentary seat in the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic. 
Lukashenko boasts[10] close ties to the Soviet Union, detailing a timeline of his previously held posts in the Soviet 
Army and his membership in the Soviet communist youth wing. At one point, in 1993, Lukashenko was named head 
of the Belarusian parliament's anti-corruption commission.  
In 1994, Lukashenko was elected president with 80.3% of the vote, running on the pledge to "take the country back 
from the abyss" - and has managed to hold on to power since. Lukashenko's hold on power wavers in 2020, and he 
is dubbed "Europe's last dictator" Lukashenko's hold on power has wavered in the last year as he faced strong

over 2 decades.
opposition in the 2020 election. Fearing that he might be toppled, he falsified election results[11] - declaring that he 
won 80% of the vote and giving himself a sixth term. 
This move sparked protests across the country[12]. Sanctions were even imposed last year by the UK and Canada 
against Belarus officials[13] in a bid by a group of Western nations, who tried to take Lukashenko to task for rigging 
the elections and repressing peaceful protests.[14] 
According to Politico[15], it is estimated that more than 35,000 Belarusians were arrested during this uprising, with 
thousands facing abuse and torture in police custody[16]. During the protests, Lukashenko attempted on multiple 
occasions to display a facade of strength - at one point releasing a video of himself stepping off a helicopter clad in 
a bulletproof vest while toting an assault rifle.[17] 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has been a strong ally of the Belarusian leader - even extending a $1.5 billion loan 
to Belarus in 2020 as a "gesture of support"[18] and volunteering aid from the Russian police during the 
protests.[19] 
Al Jazeera[20] reported that Russia also sent in Kremlin-linked journalists to change the way the protests were 
covered in Belarusian state media. 
A 2020 report[21] from the Guardian indicated then that Lukashenko was cracking under pressure, though he 
continued to resist calls for him to resign. Some media outlets then dubbed Lukashenko "Europe's last dictator"[22] 
- though some argue that while he is a dictator, he will not be the last[23]. 
His handling of the COVID pandemic in Belarus[24] drew widespread criticism and further calls for him to step 
down. But Lukashenko has maintained his grip on power. 
During a visit to a Minsk wheeled tractor plant last year, he countered a question about fair elections by saying: "I 
am answering your question. We held elections. Until you kill me, there will be no other elections." Lukashenko's 
widespread crackdown on opposition and dissent https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/24/why-belarus-risked-
the-wrath-of-the-world-to-arrest-an-activist Analysts say that the grounding of the Ryanair passenger plane this 
week is an indication that Lukashenko will continue to intensify his crackdown on independent media and pursue 
journalists who are on the run - even at the cost of provoking the international community.  
"This is a political message to the Belarusian political migrants of the new wave, and on the other hand, to his 
supporters, the so-called 'electoral swamp,'" Igar Tyshkevich, a Belarusian analyst based in Ukraine, told Al 
Jazeera. 
"The message is that the government is strong and may get to anyone," Tyshkevich added. 
So perhaps the best encapsulation of Lukashenko's life might, ironically, be one that he wrote about himself.  
"My life, just like the lives of other presidents, is very busy. You wake up and keep running. What does it feel like to 
be on the run for 25 years? I got used to it," says a quote from Lukashenko that is proudly displayed on his official 
online biography.[25] 
It continues: "This hamster wheel keeps spinning, and there is no escaping it. If you stop, it will keep moving and 
throw you back. This is a mode of life. I am used to it." Read the original article on Business Insider[26]

Angela Merkel: Russian role in Belarus incident not clear

 Chancellor Angela Merkel has said questions remain about the role of Russia in the forced landing of a plane by 
Belarus. She also said a video showing arrested dissident Raman Pratasevich in custody gave rise to concern.The 
German chancellor on Tuesday said unanswered questions remained about Russia's involvement in the forced 
landing of a plane by Belarus. 
Angela Merkel said a Kremlin connection had been discussed at an EU summit focused on Minsk's diversion of a 
Ryanair flight — and the arrest of a dissident journalist on board. 
"We touched on the question of whether Russia had anything to do with it," Merkel said in Brussels after the 
summit. "We did not have any firm findings on Russia's role," she said. 
The chancellor said she would raise the issue at a future meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Merkel previously described Belarus' contention that it was simply responding to a credible security threat on board 
the plane was "completely implausible."  
Russia sides with ex-Soviet ally 
Western powers denounced Sunday's scrambling of a warplane to escort the Athens to Vilnius Ryanair passenger 
jet as "state piracy." 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described the incident as "state hijacking," and both France and Ireland 
have labeled it as piracy. Brussels responded with new sanctions on Belarus and requested EU carriers to refrain 
from flying over Belarusian airspace. 
Moscow, however, says Minsk's actions were "absolutely reasonable." 
British Foreign Minister Dominic Raab on Monday said a Russian role in the operation appeared likely. 
"It's very difficult to believe that this kind of action could have been taken without at least the acquiescence of the 
authorities in Moscow," Raab told the UK parliament. 
Kremlin denies involvement 
Russia has denied involvement and accused Western countries of hypocrisy. In particular, it noted that a Bolivian 
presidential plane was diverted to Austria in 2013 after reports that US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden was on 
board. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday claimed that anti-Russian sentiment had fueled initial allegations 
that Moscow was involved. 
Peskov also said he hoped that 26-year-old Pratasevich's girlfriend Sofia Sapega, a Russian citizen detained along 
with the Belarusian journalist, would soon be released. 
Angela Merkel: Russian role in Belarus incident not clear
Russia confirmed on Tuesday that the 23-year-old law student was being held by Belarus under suspicion of crimes 
at the time of protests in the country last year. 
Three other passengers also left the plane at Minsk on Sunday before it was allowed to proceed to the Lithuanian 
capital. Initial assertions that the three passengers had been Russian passport holders turned out to be false. 
'Naivety towards Russian relations fading' 
Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told DW that, after the EU leaders' discussions, she believed the Belarus 
incident may have helped shift EU perspectives on Russia. 'I think the naivety toward Russian relations is fading,' 
she said after talks with other EU leaders in Brussels. 
'After Belarus — where we were very united — we also had a discussion on Russia. And these two are very 
interlinked." 
"We saw that even some countries that were previously a bit skeptical regarding Russia's deeds were now very 
shocked. I think the naivety towards Russian relations is fading," Kallas said. 
Video of dissident 'concerning' 
A video emerged on Monday showing Pratasevich confessing to some accusations leveled against him, with 
apparent bruising to the face. 
In further comments after the summit, Merkel said the video was "concerning" and described the forced landing as 
"an unprecedented and unacceptable act." 
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Belarusian President Alexander Lukasahenko must pay a "bitter price" 
for detaining Pratasevich.

 GENEVA - The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights says the seizure by Belarus of a journalist 
traveling on a plane is tantamount to extraordinary rendition - a state-sponsored abduction. Belarusian journalist 
Raman Pratasevich was arrested after a Ryanair plane traveling from Athens, Greece, to Vilnius, Lithuania, was 
diverted by a Belarusian fighter jet and forced to land in Belarus's capital, Minsk, on Sunday. Human rights officials 
say they are shocked by the manner in which the journalist was detained.

to be seen in a pre-trial detention facility in Minsk, Belarus May 24, 2021, in this still image taken from video. 
(Telegram@Zheltyeslivy/Reuters TV) Rupert Colville, spokesman for the U.N . high commissioner, criticized the 
threat of military force to divert the plane from its flight path. 'Such abuse of state power against a journalist for 
exercising functions that are protected under international law is receiving, and deserves, the strongest 
condemnation. We fear for Raman Pratasevich's safety and wish to seek assurances that he is treated humanely 
and is not subjected to ill treatment or torture,' he said. Colville said Pratasevich's appearance on state TV Monday 
evening with bruising on his face is not reassuring. He said Pratasevich's so-called confession to serious crimes 
apparently was forced under torture, which is prohibited under international law. The U.S.-based Committee to 
Protect Journalists says it is unable to verify the time or circumstances under which the video was recorded. The 
CPJ has called for Pratasevich's immediate and unconditional release. Pratasevich is co-founder of the opposition 
Nexta channels, which helped mobilize street protests after Belarus's August 9 presidential election. President 
Alexander Lukashenko claimed victory in that election, which has been widely viewed as rigged. The Minsk 
government has accused Pratasevich of terrorism and provoking riots after the Nexta channels became one of the 
main conduits for organizing last year's anti-Lukashenko protests over alleged election fraud. Colville said the 
arbitrary arrest of Pratasevich and manner of his seizure is a sign of an extremely worrying escalation in the 
government's crackdown on dissenting voices. 
'This astonishing episode constitutes a new phase in the Belarusian authorities' campaign of repression against 
journalists and civil society in general. In addition to the issues relating to Mr. Pratasevich, the forced landing of the 
UN Likens Belarus ' Seizure of Journalist to Extraordinary Rendition
passenger plane in Minsk terrorized passengers on board and exposed them to unnecessary danger, in violation of 
their human rights,' he said. 
Colville said he was also concerned about Pratasevich's friend, Sofia Sapaga, who reportedly also has been 
arbitrarily detained. His office is calling for their immediate release and says both should be allowed to continue on 
to Vilnius, their intended destination.

 After Belarus diverted a Ryanair plane and arrested a dissident blogger, the EU was quick to impose new 
sanctions on Minsk. DW takes a look at the measures and what they entail.European Union leaders called 
Sunday's military interception of a Ryanair passenger plane and the subsequent arrest of an opposition blogger a 
"hijacking," an "attack on democracy" and an "international scandal." 
After Belarusian authorities took Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, into custody, the EU was 
uncharacteristically swift to slap new sanctions on Belarus. Monday's measures included a ban on Belarusian 
airlines using EU airspace or airports.  
'Completely implausible' 
Prior to his arrest, Raman Pratasevich, a known critic of authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, was 
traveling from Greece to Lithuania. Minsk ordered the commercial plane flying over its airspace to land, claiming a 
bomb was on board — an explanation German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called "completely implausible." 
Belarusian state TV has since broadcast a video, showing Pratavesich with dark marks on his face, acknowledging 
his role in recent anti-government protests. The opposition says he was forced to film the statement.  
When EU leaders met on Monday in Brussels, they called for the immediate release of Pratasevich and his 
girlfriend. They also unanimously agreed to hold Belarus accountable.  
"Lukashenko and his regime have to understand this will have severe consequences," European Commission 
President Ursula von der Leyen said. 
But what are the consequences and what do they entail? 
Restrictions on airspace 
Since Belarus intercepted a flight between two EU countries, the 27-nation bloc also decided to hit back in the 
skies. It has banned Belarus' airlines from its airspace and airports, as well as urging EU-based plane carriers to 
avoid flying in Belarusian airspace. 
Lufthansa, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines are among the airline companies that have already 
started doing this. 
What effect will the EU's sanctions have on Belarus?
 But such a move is largely symbolic and does not have any real effect on Lukashenko's politics, according to 
Dzianis Melyantsou of the Minsk Dialogue Council on International Relations.  
He says the measure could actually make Belarus more dependent on Russia as the restrictions could bankrupt the 
country's state airline — which could then be bought out by Russia. Melyantsou also observed that pro-European 
sentiment among Belarusians gets stronger the more they can travel to the EU. 
"Restrictions that isolate the Belarusian people as opposed to the Belarusian government could turn Belarusians 
against the EU," said Melyantsou. "That's why these rushed decisions won't have any effect." 
Investigation into forced plane diversion 
EU leaders called on the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to investigate the plane diversion. The 
ICAO is a specialized UN agency that can issue standards and recommendations, but does not have any regulatory 
power. 
Sanctions on individuals and businesses 
Since October 2020, the EU has progressively been restricting more and more key political figures, including 
President Alexander Lukashenko, with measures like travel bans and asset freezes. They first came as a response 
to Belarus' crackdown on peaceful protesters. 
With the arrest of Pratasevich, the bloc decided to add even more targets to its sanction list of 88 individuals and 
seven entities. 
"There will be additional sanctions on individuals that are involved in the hijacking, but this time also on businesses 
and economic entities that are financing this regime," von der Leyen told reporters. 
According to Pavel Usov, director of the Center for Political Analysis and Prognosis in Warsaw, these measures are 
necessary to signal to Lukashenko that he does not have a carte blanche to treat his citizens any way he wants. But 
in practice, they do not have much of an effect on him. 
"Lukashenko is propagating terror in his country and abroad. In reality, neither sanctions nor international 
agreements will deter him," said Usov. "They won't necessarily lead to a quick change in the country, but these 
measures are imperative." 
Billion-euro economic package is off the table 
Von der Leyen also announced that the EU has a €3 billion ($3.6 billion) investment package ready for Belarus that 
it will now freeze until the country "turns democratic."

 EU leaders are to discuss the bloc's fight against COVID-19 and climate change on day two of their summit. The 
first day saw unusually quick action taken against Belarus over the forced landing of a Ryanair flight.EU leaders are 
turning their attention to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the urgent problem of climate change on the 
second day of a special meeting of the European Council on Tuesday. 
This comes after they agreed on Monday to impose new sanctions on Belarus after Minsk forced a Ryanair 
passenger jet to land to arrest an activist journalist on board. 
What is on Tuesday's agenda? 
Although developments connected to Belarus are likely to figure largely at the leaders' talks on day two as well, the 
topic officially slated for discussion is the EU's response to COVID-19. 
The talks will focus not only on current measures to stem the spread of the illness, but also on how to counter the 
economic fallout caused by the pandemic. 
The leaders will also discuss the EU's efforts to combat climate change. 
Among other things, they will attempt to come up with guidelines to reach binding EU targets to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions. 
The bloc is aiming to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. 
What happened on Monday? 
Monday's debate was dominated by events in Belarus surrounding the forced landing of a Ryanair plane and the 
arrest of Raman Pratasevich, a government-critical journalist.  
Among other things, EU leaders called for further targeted economic sanctions on Belarus and urged all EU-based 
carriers to avoid flying through Belarusian airspace. 
They also called for the immediate release of Pratasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, a law student. 
The leaders also discussed EU-Russian relations in face of actions by Moscow that they termed "illegal, 
provocative and disruptive." 
Such actions include Russian support for an insurgency in eastern Ukraine and the poisoning and then 
imprisonment of leading opposition figure Alexei Navalny. 
At the meeting, leaders also condemned the arrest of Mali's interim President Bah N'Daw and Prime Minister 
Moctar Ouane and said the EU would consider sanctions against those obstructing the Malian transition.

 Germany will not send a team to the European Track Cycling Championships in Minsk as a result of the forced 
landing of a passenger plane. The organizers of the competition are under pressure to find an alternative host.The 
European Track Cycling Championships in Minsk next month will be without several of its top athletes, after Belarus 
purposely diverted a Ryanair passenger plane so that it could arrest a high-profile opposition activist. 
The German Cycling Federation, the BDR, was the first to announce it would not send a team on Tuesday. The 
BDR contacted the European Cycling Union (UEC), the body responsible for organizing the championships, and 
"made it clear that under these circumstances the German national track cycling team would not be able to 
participate" in the event, which is scheduled to take place in the Belarusian capital at the end of June. 
Representatives of Great Britain and the Netherlands have also signalled that those nations may withdraw. 
The BDR also pushed the UEC to find an alternative host. The action to arrest opposition activist Raman 
Pratasevich on Sunday was widely condemned as a "hijacking" by European leaders. In response, the European 
Union agreed to a new round of sanctions on the Belarusian regime of longtime leader Alexander Lukashenko, 
including shutting Belarus out of European airspace. 
Decision to be made 
DW approached the UEC with a list of questions relating to the hosting of the championships on Monday but was 
told by the organization's president, Enrico Della Casa, that "due to the recent incorrect press articles published we 
do not wish to comment further." Della Casa didn't specify which articles he took issue with. The Danish newspaper 
Berlingske previously reported that the Netherlands, Lithuania and Denmark had all offered to step in as possible 
replacements, but that all three offers — which came at various points over the last year — were rejected by the 
UEC. 
The UEC published a statement on its website later on Tuesday saying that it was "carefully monitoring the 
situation" and that it would make a decision on the championships after a board meeting on Thursday. 
Sunday's incident has put a renewed spotlight on Belarus' hosting of sporting events. UEFA, European football's 
governing body, was recently criticized for awarding the 2025 Women's European Under-19 Championship to 
Belarus. In January, Minsk was stripped of its half of the Ice Hockey World Championship, amid a backlash from 
major sponsors, European politicians and opposition groups. 
Sanctions imposed 
Since Lukashenko's disputed re-election as president last August, some 35,000 people have been arrested in 
Belarus amid a violent crackdown on opposition protesters. 
Germany will not send cycling team to Belarus
Athletes have been among those detained or punished by the regime, leading the International Olympic Committee 
(IOC) to sanction Belarusian sports officials and warn other sports bodies to "respect these measures in the interest 
of protecting Belarusian athletes' rights." 
The IOC's remarks were taken by many to mean that Belarus shouldn't be awarded or allowed to retain the hosting 
rights for international competitions. However, despite pressure from the Belarusian Sport Solidarity Foundation 
(BSSF), an opposition athlete-led movement, the UEC has so far decided to stick by Minsk. 
In a letter to the BSSF in March, a copy of which has been seen by DW, Della Casa wrote that "we are legally 
contracted to host this event at this time and location and were unable to find another suitable host on this date," 
adding that "the UEC respects the equality of all its member national federations and does not and cannot get 
involved in the internal matters of these federations." 
'Wise decision' 
Della Casa also pointed to the fact that there have been no major international track cycling competitions since 
early last year. "We would remind you that if the [championships] were to be removed from Belarus, it would be the 
athletes themselves who would lose the most from this decision." 
In a statement to DW, the BSSF said that it welcomed the "wise decision of the German cycling federation not to 
travel to Belarus" and once again called on the UEC to make the "only right decision when it is not too late and 
cancel" the championships in Belarus. 
"Considering the latest shocking turn of events we find it surprising that the senior management of the European 
Cycling Union takes time to make a decision that will primarily keep athletes, sports and media specialists safe," the 
BSSF said. "The decision will keep them out of any activities that can even remotely become part of the power 
legitimization of the world's most dangerous man. 
"European parliamentarians, as well as ministers of sports of the European Union member states, previously 
expressed their concern about the situation in Belarusian sport and have stated that it is not possible to hold any 
international sports competitions in the country where human rights are violated every day and human dignity is 
humiliated. That was even before the hijacking of the plane."

another blatant attempt by the Belarusian authorities to silence all opposition voices."
EU diplomats were quoted saying the bloc is considering sanctions against Belarus including barring the country's 
flagship carrier from EU airports as well as declaring the Belarus airspace unsafe. Belarus called the criticism 
"baseless," while Russia reportedly termed the EU reaction "shocking."

BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union agreed Monday to impose sanctions on Belarus, including banning its 
airlines from using the airspace and airports of the 27-nation bloc, amid fury over the forced diversion of a 
passenger jet to arrest an opposition journalist.
Reacting to what EU leaders called a brazen “hijacking” of the Ryanair jetliner flying from Greece to Lithuania on 
Sunday, they also demanded the immediate release of the journalist, Raman Pratasevich, a key foe of authoritarian 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.
“We won’t tolerate that one can try to play Russian roulette with the lives of innocent civilians,” said EU Council 
chief Charles Michel, who presided over the EU meeting.
A brief video clip of Pratasevich, who ran a popular messaging app that played a key role in helping organize huge 
protests against Lukashenko, was shown on Belarusian state television Monday night, a day after he was removed 
from the Ryanair flight.
Sitting at a table with his hands folded in front of him and speaking rapidly, Pratasevich said he was in satisfactory 
health and said his treatment in custody was “maximally correct and according to law.” He added that he was giving 
evidence to investigators about organizing mass disturbances.
In their unusually swift action in Brussels, the EU leaders also urged all EU-based carriers to avoid flying over 
Belarus, decided to impose sanctions on officials linked to Sunday's flight diversion, and urged the International 
Civil Aviation Organization to start an investigation into what they viewed as an unprecedented move and what 
some said amounted to state terrorism or piracy.
The leaders called on their council “to adopt the necessary measures to ban overflight of EU airspace by Belarusian 
airlines and prevent access to EU airports of flights operated by such airlines.” In addition calling for the release of 
Pratasevich, they also urged authorities in Minsk to free his Russian girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, who was taken off the 
plane with him.
EU leaders agree on Belarus sanctions after plane diversion
The text was endorsed quickly by the leaders who were determined to respond with a “strong reaction” to the 
incident because of the “serious endangering of aviation safety and passengers on board by Belarussian 
authorities,” said an EU official with direct knowledge of the discussions who was not authorized to speak publicly 
about the private talks.
Ryanair said Belarusian flight controllers told the crew there was a bomb threat against the plane as it was crossing 
through Belarus airspace Sunday and ordered it to land. A Belarusian MiG-29 fighter jet was scrambled to escort 
the plane in a brazen show of force by Lukashenko, who has ruled the country with an iron fist for over a quarter-
century.
Belarus authorities then arrested the 26-year-old activist, journalist and prominent Lukashenko critic. Pratasevich 
and his Russian girlfriend were taken off the plane shortly after it landed, and authorities haven't said where they're 
being held. Ryanair Flight FR4978, which began in Athens, Greece, was eventually allowed to continue on to 
Vilnius, Lithuania.
“This is an attack on democracy,” said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the executive European Commission. 
“This is an attack on freedom of expression. And this is an attack on European sovereignty. And this outrageous 
behavior needs a strong answer.”
Von der Leyen added that a \u20ac3 billion EU investment and economic package for Belarus will remain on hold 
until Belarus “turns democratic.”
U.S. President Joe Biden said late Monday that he asked his team to develop appropriate options to hold 
accountable those responsible, in close coordination with the European Union, other allies and partners, and 
international organizations.
“This outrageous incident and the video Mr. Pratasevich appears to have made under duress are shameful assaults 
on both political dissent and the freedom of the press. The United States joins countries around the world in calling 
for his release, as well as for the release of the hundreds of political prisoners who are being unjustly detained by 
the Lukashenka regime,” Biden's statement said.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said earlier that National Security adviser Jake Sullivan raised the issue in 
a call with the secretary of the Russian Security Council.
EU leaders were particularly forceful in their condemnation of the arrest and the move against the plane, which was 
flying between two of the bloc’s member nations and was being operated by an airline based in Ireland, also a 
member.
EU leaders have tried to bring Belarus closer to the bloc — to encourage democratic reforms and reduce the 
influence of Russia — but have failed so far.
British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he instructed the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority “to request airlines 
avoid Belarusian airspace in order to keep passengers safe.” He added he was suspending the permit allowing 
Belavia to operate in the U.K.
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ordered officials to move to cut the air link with Belarus and ban Ukrainian 
flights via the neighbor's airspace.
The U.S. and the EU have imposed sanctions on top Belarusian officials amid months of protests, which were 
triggered by Lukashenko’s reelection to a sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition rejected as rigged. 
More than 34,000 people have been arrested in Belarus since then, and thousands beaten.
The Belarusian Foreign Ministry bristled at what it described as “belligerent” EU statements, insisting Minsk acted 
“in full conformity with international rules.”
EU leaders agree on Belarus sanctions after plane diversion
It ordered all Latvian diplomats out of the country after the Belarusian flag was replaced Monday with the white-and-
red one used by the opposition at the world ice hockey championship in Riga, Latvia. The event was moved from 
Minsk amid the international outcry over the crackdown.
Lufthansa said a flight from Minsk to Frankfurt with 51 people aboard was delayed Monday following a “security 
warning.” It was allowed to depart after the plane, passengers and cargo were searched.
On Sunday, flight tracker sites indicated the Ryanair flight was about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Lithuanian 
border when it was diverted. There were conflicting reports on what exactly happened.
Belarusian transport ministry official Artem Sikorsky said the Minsk airport had received an email about the bomb 
threat from the Palestinian militant group Hamas.
But Ryanair said in a statement that Belarusian air traffic control instructed the plane to divert to the capital. The 
plane was searched, and no bomb was found. Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary described the move as “a case of 
state-sponsored hijacking \u2026 state-sponsored piracy.”
Passengers described Pratasevich's shock when he realized the plane was going to Minsk.
“He freaked out when the pilot said the plane is diverted to Minsk. He said there’s death penalty awaiting him there,” 
passenger Marius Rutkauskas said after the plane finally arrived in Vilnius.
Pratasevich was a co-founder of the Telegram messaging app’s Nexta channel, which played a prominent role in 
helping organize the anti-Lukashenko protests. Nearly 2 million Belarusians in the nation of 9.3 million people have 
followed the channel. Belarus authorities have labeled the channel “extremist” and charged Pratasevich in absentia 
of inciting mass riots and fanning social hatred. He could face 15 years in prison.
Amid the international outrage, Moscow quickly offered a helping hand to its ally.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the episode needs to be investigated — but that it couldn’t be rushed. 
Moscow and Minsk have close political, economic and military ties, and Lukashenko has relied on Russian support 
amid Western sanctions.

Europeans threaten to limit Belarus air traffic after 'state piracy'

European leaders threatened to limit international air traffic over Belarus and possibly target its ground transport as 
well, after a Ryanair plane was forced to land in an incident denounced by Western countries as "state piracy".
Western leaders reached for the strongest language to condemn Sunday's incident, in which a Belarusian warplane 
intercepted a flight between Greece and Lithuania and forced it down in Minsk, where a dissident journalist was 
arrested.
Countries called for the release of 26-year-old Roman Protasevich, whose social media feed from exile has been 
one of the last remaining independent outlets for news about the country since a mass crackdown on dissent last 
year.
"This was effectively aviation piracy, state sponsored," said Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, using 
language that was echoed by a number of other countries. Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde said: "It is 
dangerous, reckless, and naturally the EU is going to act."
The French presidency said a request had been sent to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to 
suspend international overflights over Belarusian air space. Banning the Belarusian state carrier Belavia from 
European airport was also being discussed, as were ground transport links.
Still, the options for Western retaliation appear limited. The Montreal-based ICAO has no regulatory power, and the 
EU has no authority over flights taking off and landing in Belarus or flying over its air space, apart from direct flights 
that originate or land in Europe. Belarus has shrugged off previous rounds of EU and U.S. financial sanctions.
Ahead of a scheduled meeting of the 27 EU national leaders in Brussels, Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida 
Simonyte said she would push with partners to close the airspace of Belarus to international flights. She did not 
explain how this would be achieved.
Belarus says it was acting in response to a bomb threat on the flight, although this turned out to be false. It said on 
Monday its ground controllers had given guidance to the flight but had not ordered it to land.
State media said the decision to intervene had been ordered personally by President Alexander Lukashenko.
Europeans threaten to limit Belarus air traffic after 'state piracy'
Russia accused the West of hypocrisy, noting that in 2013 a flight from Moscow carrying Bolivian President Evo 
Morales had been diverted to Austria after reports fugitive U.S. intelligence leaker Edward Snowden might be on 
board.
The EU and the United States already imposed several rounds of financial sanctions against Minsk last year, which 
had no effect on the behaviour of long-serving leader Lukashenko, a close Russian ally who withstood mass 
demonstrations against his rule after a disputed election.
The head of the foreign affairs committee in the British parliament, Tom Tugendhat, noting that the flight was 
between two members of both EU and the NATO military alliance, said: "If it's not an act of war, it's certainly a 
warlike act."
Airlines Halt Flights Over Belarus
Belarus lies on the flight path of some important north-south routes in Europe as well as east-west routes between 
Europe and Asia.
ICAO, a U.N. body, said the incident may have contravened the core treaty that governs global aviation.
"ICAO is strongly concerned by the apparent forced landing of a Ryanair flight and its passengers, which could be 
in contravention of the Chicago Convention," it said. "We look forward to more information being officially confirmed 
by the countries and operators concerned."
A Latvian airline, airBaltic, became the first on Monday to announce it would no longer fly over Belarusian air space. 
However, it was not clear that other airlines would do so unless required. KLM of the Netherlands said it had carried 
out a risk assessment and was making no changes for now.
Ryanair RYA.I boss Michael O'Leary, who referred to the incident as a state-sponsored hijacking, said he believed 
security agents had been on the flight and had disembarked in Minsk. That would mean the operation had 
effectively been coordinated with spies operating on the ground in Greece.
"The EU will consider the consequences of this action, including taking measures against those responsible," EU 
foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement on Monday. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen 
said "the outrageous and illegal behaviour of the regime in Belarus will have consequences".
Minsk has shrugged off previous sanctions since last year, which consist mainly of adding various officials to black 
lists which restrict their right to travel or do business in Europe and the United States. The EU was already working 
on a fourth round before the Ryanair incident.
Additional steps could now include suspending overflights of EU airlines over Belarus or banning the Belarusian 
airline Belavia from landing at EU airports. An EU official said suspending ground transit could also be discussed.
Protasevich's whereabouts were not made public. A university in Vilnius said one of its students, Sofia Sapega, 23, 
was travelling with him and had also been detained.
After Protasevich was arrested, flight 4978 was allowed to travel on to Vilnius, where weary passengers 
disembarked. One, who gave his name as Mantas, described the moment when the pilot had come on the intercom 
to tell passengers they were being diverted to Minsk, with no explanation. Protasevich immediately shot to his feet, 
knowing his time was up.
"Roman stood up, opened the luggage compartment, took luggage and was trying to split things," giving a laptop 
and phone to his female companion, Mantas told Reuters. Once the plane landed, police took Protasevich away.
"We saw from the window that Roman is standing alone, and one policeman with dog was trying to find something" 
in his luggage, Mantas said.

Another exhausted passenger, speaking to reporters without giving her name, said Protasevich looked "super 
scared".
"I looked directly into his eyes and he was very sad."

Global aviation faces its biggest political crisis in years after Belarus scrambled a fighter and flagged what turned 
out to be a false bomb alert to detain a dissident journalist, prompting U.S. and European outrage.
Some European airlines immediately began avoiding Belarus airspace, a key corridor between western Europe and 
Moscow and route for long-haul flights between western Europe and Asia.
"We, like all the European airlines are looking for guidance today from the European authorities and from NATO," 
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told Ireland's Newstalk radio.
Others, including Chinese and Turkish carriers, continued to fly over Belarus, which charges euro-denominated 
fees to use its airspace. Each flight brings Minsk revenue equivalent to some $500, adding up to millions each year, 
a Belarus official said.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said it had notified its 31 member states about the incident 
and an airline source said the agency had recommended "caution" over Belarus.
Aviation experts said a decades-old system of cooperation now faces a crucial test under the glare of East-West 
tensions.
The U.N.'s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) said the incident may have contravened a core aviation 
treaty: part of the international order created after World War Two.
"ICAO is strongly concerned by the apparent forced landing of a Ryanair flight and its passengers, which could be 
in contravention of the Chicago Convention," it said on Sunday.
The Montreal agency called a meeting of its 36-member council, which has power to investigate any situation that 
may hinder the development of international aviation, for Thursday.
"It looks like a gross abuse of the (Chicago) Convention. It's piracy," Kevin Humphreys, a former Irish aviation 
regulator, said of the Belarus incident.
But experts cautioned that calls from some Western politicians for the outright closure of Belarus airspace would 
come up against tough obstacles.
Global aviation system tested by Belarus jetliner diversion
Under global rules, neither ICAO nor any nation can close another's airspace, but some, such as the United States, 
have the power to tell their own airlines not to fly there.
NO REGULATOR
Global airlines condemned any unlawful interference.
"A full investigation by competent international authorities is needed," said the International Air Transport 
Association, which represents about 280 airlines. Ryanair is not a member.
It was not immediately clear how any probe would be organised.
Although highly regulated at a national level, and supported by harmonised rules to keep skies safe, aviation lacks 
a global policeman to avoid constant disputes over sovereignty.
While it has no regulatory power, ICAO sits at the centre of a system of safety and security standards that operates 
across political barriers but requires an often slow-moving consensus.
The rules are managed through the Montreal-based agency by its 193 members, including Belarus.
ICAO was thrown into discord over a wave of hijackings in the 1980s. Back then, the issue was whether to oblige 
countries to agree to let hijacked aircraft land on their soil.
Humphreys said it would be the first time in memory that the agency has had to ponder accusations that one of its 
own member countries had carried out what Ryanair's O'Leary called "state-sponsored hijacking".
Belarus insisted the alert was not a hoax and said its controllers had only issued "recommendations" to Ryanair 
pilots.
Russia accused the West of hypocrisy, citing the case of a Bolivian presidential plane forced to land in Austria in 
2013 or a Belarus jetliner ordered to land in Ukraine three years later.
In 2013, Bolivia said President Evo Morales' plane had been diverted over suspicions that former U.S. spy agency 
contractor Edward Snowden, wanted by Washington for divulging secret details of U.S. surveillance activities, was 
on board.
But aviation experts said the freedoms extended to civil airliners do not apply to presidential or state aircraft, which 
need special permission to enter another country's airspace.
In the 2016 incident, Belarus national carrier Belavia said it had demanded compensation from Ukraine.
Lawyers say any probe or legal claim would also have to plough through a tangle of jurisdictions typical of 
liberalised air travel: a Polish-registered jet flown by an Irish group between EU nations Greece and Lithuania, over 
non-EU Belarus.
Under the 1944 Chicago Convention, each country has sovereignty over its own airspace, though the treaty 
prohibits any use of civil aviation that may endanger safety.
But the right to overfly other countries is contained in a side treaty called the International Air Services Transit 
Agreement, of which Belarus is not a member.
A separate 1971 treaty that includes Belarus outlaws the seizure of aircraft or knowingly communicating false 
information in a way that endangers aircraft safety.

European nations were demanding answers after Belarusian authorities dispatched a fighter jet to force a Ryanair 
flight to divert to Minsk, where a dissident journalist who was on board was then arrested.
Ryanair said its plane was flying from Greece to Lithuania on Sunday when it was notified of "a potential security 
threat on board" by air traffic controllers in Belarus and told to divert to Minsk for an emergency landing.
The airline said the plane landed safely in Belarusian capital and "nothing untoward was found" after passengers 
were offloaded and an inspection took place.
But authorities at the airport used the opportunity to arrest Roman Protasevich, a Belarusian journalist and 
opposition activist, who was a passenger, according to state media and the rights group Viasna.
The opposition news outlet Nexta also confirmed the arrest of Protasevich, the organization's co-founder and 
former editor who has been living in exile.
Governments across Europe reacted with the outrage, suggesting authoritarian Belarus used the pretext of a safety 
threat to conduct a "state hijacking" of a civilian airliner in order to go after a critic.
Belarusian state media reported that the plane's diversion came on the personal instructions of long-time President 
Alexander Lukashenko after he had purportedly been alerted to a possible bomb on board and was concerned 
about the plane's safety.
He also ordered a MiG-29 fighter jet be scrambled to accompany the Ryanair plane, according to the Belta state 
news agency.
Belarus activist arrested after fighter jet intercepts Ryanair flight
Lukashenko, 66, has led Belarus - a former Soviet republic in Eastern Europe bordering EU states Poland, 
Lithuania and Latvia - for more than a quarter of a century, tolerating little dissent.
Mass protests against his rule erupted after a presidential election last year that was widely seen as unfair and rife 
with electoral fraud.
Belarus calls Nexta an extremist organization and Protasevich has been wanted by authorities. Nexta had urged on 
the protests against Lukashenko.
Lukashenko has long considered Protasevich to be an enemy. The country's KGB secret service had reportedly put 
his name on a list of people accused of alleged terrorism and he faces years in prison if convicted.
Condemnation of Belarus came swiftly on Sunday, with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg calling for an 
international investigation and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen saying the "utterly 
unacceptable" incident "must bear consequences."
The United States demanded Protasevich be immediately released. Secretary of State Antony Blinken strongly 
condemned the forced diversion and Protasevich's arrest.
"This shocking act perpetrated by the Lukashenka regime endangered the lives of more than 120 passengers, 
including U.S. citizens," Blinken said in a statement.
The 27 EU leaders will discuss Belarus during a previously scheduled summit in Brussels on Monday, including the 
possibility of imposing sanctions on Minsk, a spokesperson for EU Council President Charles Michel said.
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda tweeted that Belarus had committed an "abhorrent action" and demanded 
the release of Protasevich.
The Lithuanian Prosecutor-General's Office said the country has launched a preliminary investigation into the jet's 
forced diversion.
The Greek Foreign Ministry said it "strongly condemns the state hijacking," while Britain, Germany, France, Poland, 
Austria, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands were among the chorus denouncing Minsk.
Ryanair Flight FR4978 was en route from Athens to the Lithuanian capital Vilnius when it was ordered to land in 
Minsk.
Former Belarusian culture minister Pavel Latushko, who lives in exile in the EU, said, citing his contacts, that the 
flight control centre in Minsk threatened the pilots with shooting down the plane if they did not land.
Greece and Lithuania put the number of passengers on board at 171, although Ryanair has not provided a figure. 
Lithuania said most of the passengers were Lithuanian nationals. Belarus had said the plane had 123 passengers.
The Irish low-cost airline said the plane spent seven hours on the ground in Minsk undergoing security checks 
before it was allowed to depart at 8:50 pm (1750 GMT). It landed in Vilnius a little over 30 minutes later.
Ryanair made no mention of Protasevich in its statement.
Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who many in Belarus consider the true winner of the 
2020 presidential election, urged the international community to punish Lukashenko.

A Ryanair plane from Greece to Lithuania was diverted to Belarus for several hours on Sunday, with activists saying 
it was done to arrest a dissident journalist on board.
European nations reacted with outrage, accusing Belarus of "state terrorism".
The ex-editor of the Nexta group, Roman Protasevich, was detained before the plane was allowed to resume its 
flight.
Belarus media said a MiG-29 escorted the jet to Minsk because of a bomb scare but no explosives were found.
The plane finally landed in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, its original destination, at 21:25 local time (18:25 GMT), 
more than seven hours after its scheduled arrival.
Arriving passengers said they had been given no information about the reason for the abrupt diversion to Minsk. 
One said Mr Protasevich looked "super scared. I looked directly to his eyes and it was very sad".
Another, Monika Simkiene, told AFP news agency: "He just turned to people and said he was facing the death 
penalty."
There have already been calls for the EU and Nato to intervene.
UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab warned the "outlandish action" would have "serious implications".
Belarus opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who was beaten by Alexander Lukashenko in presidential polls 
last year widely denounced as rigged, was among those demanding Mr Protasevich's release.
Since August's election, 66-year-old Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled the country since 1994, has cracked down on 
dissenting voices. Many opposition figures have been arrested or, like Ms Tikhanovskaya, fled into exile.
How was the flight diverted?
Flight FR4978 was en route from Athens to Vilnius when it turned east to Minsk shortly before it reached the 
Lithuanian border. Greece and Lithuania put the number of passengers on board at 171.
Belarus 'diverts Ryanair flight to arrest journalist', opposition says
In a statement, Ryanair said that the crew had been "notified by Belarus (Air Traffic Control) of a potential security 
threat on board and were instructed to divert to the nearest airport, Minsk".
The flight path, visible on the Flightradar24 website, suggests the plane was actually nearer to Vilnius than Minsk 
when it turned.
Ryanair said checks in Minsk found "nothing untoward" and the aircraft left Minsk at 20:50 local time.
"We apologise sincerely to all affected passengers for this regrettable delay which was outside Ryanair's control," it 
added.
The Ryanair statement made no mention of Mr Protasevich.
Nexta was the first to break the news of his arrest. It said the plane and its passengers was searched, then Mr 
Protasevich was taken away.
Belta, the state-owned news agency in Belarus, said Mr Lukashenko had personally given the order for the plane to 
land in Minsk following the bomb alert, and approved despatching the MiG-29 fighter jet.
What has the reaction been?
It has been angry and it is growing.
The US ambassador to Belarus, Julie Fisher, tweeted that it was "abhorrent" Mr Lukashenko had faked a bomb 
threat and sent fighter jets to arrest a journalist.
European Council chairman Charles Michel said EU leaders would discuss "this unprecedented incident" on 
Monday at a Council summit and it would not "remain without consequences".
Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said this was a "serious and dangerous incident".
Both Latvia and Lithuania said the airspace over Belarus should be recognised as unsafe, with Latvia's Foreign 
Minister Edgars Rinkevics saying it should be closed to all international flights.
The UN's agency for civil aviation, ICAO, said it was concerned about an "apparent forced landing" which could be 
"in contravention of the Chicago Convention" which sets out the rules on airspace and aircraft safety.
Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said: "Hijacking a civilian plane is an unprecedented act of state 
terrorism that cannot go unpunished." www.bbc.com/news

Ryanair Holdings has issued five-year Eurobonds seeking to raise EUR1.2 billion euros (USD1.45 billion) as it 
gears up for the uptick in demand during the summer 2021 season. The Irish low-cost carrier said the bond would 
be listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and would offer a fixed coupon rate of 0.875%. Ryanair Holdings posted a 
EUR815 million (USD992 million) net loss for the fiscal year ended on March 31, 2021, but is hopeful that an 
ongoing vaccination campaign around Europe will result in a relatively quick rebound in demand during the next few 
months. "[The vaccination rate] allows for removal of many of the travel restrictions into the July, August, 
September peak travel period. 
And we expect to see our traffic recover strongly into that period... April-June quarter traffic will, however, be still 
heavily curtailed. But we're hopeful that the September quarter will see a significant recovery of traffic, and that we'll 
be able to build on that into the third and fourth quarter of the current year," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said 
during the quarterly earnings call. Despite the expected recovery, Ryanair foresees a small loss or breakeven result 
at best during the current financial year. Besides its strong liquidity and fresh capital, the airline sees its fleet plans 
as a strong asset for the recovery period. Ryanair has 210 B737-8-200s on firm order from Boeing with deliveries 
due to begin shortly. O'Leary stressed that the type would lower Ryanair's costs and give it a competitive edge in a 
tight market. At the same time, the group is looking to consolidate its fleet around Boeing aircraft. Although in the 
past O'Leary saw Lauda (now Lauda Europe) with its fleet of Airbus narrowbodies as beneficial to the group in that 
it gave it leverage with both Airbus and Boeing in procurement discussions, Ryanair Holdings now no longer sees 
any future for A320s in its fleet. "We start returning the first A320s from the winter of 2022. Over a three- to four-
year period, that fleet will wind down," Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan said. Lauda Europe currently operates 
twenty-nine A320-200s. All other group units - Ryanair, Ryanair UK, Buzz, and Malta Air - operate B737-800s only 
and soon B737-8-200s. Sorahan confirmed that the airline was still negotiating a potential order for B737-10s, 
although deliveries of the type would not begin earlier than in 2026.

The diversion of a Ryanair flight by the Belarusian regime to arrest a journalist has drew condemnation by western 
nations. Many of these nations have called for sanctions. Several European airlines have chosen to avoid Belarus' 
airspace.
On 23 May, an armed Belarusian MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jet intercepted Ryanair's Boeing 737, registered SP-RSM, 
operating flight FR4978 from Athens, Greece, to Vilnius, Lithuania. 126 passengers and six crew members were on 
board the airliner. The interception was launched due to an alleged a bomb threat on the aircraft. The 737 was 
escorted to carry out an emergency landing at Minsk National Airport (MSQ) in the capital city of Belarus.
At the time of the diversion, the aircraft was 72km away from Vilnius, its destination, and 30km from the Lithuanian 
border. Despite the alleged urgency of the bomb threat, Belarus authorities preferred to divert to Minsk, 183km 
away. Other Belarusian airports were also closer, such as Grodno Airport as a point of diversion.
When the plane landed in Minsk, two passengers were detained by the KGB, the Belarusian security services. They 
were identified as Roman Protasevich and his partner Sofia Sapega, a student. Protasevich is a Belarusian 
journalist, co-founder, and former editor-in-chief of the Nexta information channel.
Nexta was particularly active during the recent protests in Belarus which started in May 2020, following the sixth 
reelection of President Alexander Lukashenko. According to the exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, 
Protasevich may face the death penalty in Belarus, the last European country to apply such sentence.
Other passengers reported being searched and detained for seven hours. The plane departed from Minsk and 
landed in Vilnius later in the evening of 23 May, where it was met by Lithuanian authorities. Roman Protasevich was 
not on board.

 Belarus forced a Ryanair flight carrying a wanted opposition activist to land in the capital Minsk on Sunday, 
provoking a furious outcry from world leaders who described it as a "hijacking" and an "act of state terrorism". 
Belarusian state television reported that Roman Protasevich, a 26-year-old dissident journalist exiled in Poland, had 
been detained in the capital Minsk after flight FR4978 was diverted from its Athens-to-Vilnius route, ostensibly over 
a security scare. 
After finally landing in Vilnius several hours after the scheduled time of arrival -- without Protasevich -- some 
passengers described seeing the activist looking nervous as the flight was diverted to Belarus. 
"He just turned to people and said he was facing the death penalty," Monika Simkiene, a 40-year-old Lithuanian, 
told AFP.

Edvinas Dimsa, 37, said: "He was not screaming, but it was clear that he was very much afraid. It looked like if the 
window had been open, he would have jumped out of it." 
The European Union is set to discuss toughening its existing sanctions against Belarus -- imposed over the 
crackdown by the regime of President Alexander Lukashenko on opposition protesters -- at a pre-planned summit 
on Monday. 
"The outrageous and illegal behaviour of the regime in Belarus will have consequences," EU chief Ursula von der 
Leyen tweeted, calling for Protasevich's release, and adding that those responsible "must be sanctioned". 
 Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki denounced Belarus's actions as "an act of state terrorism", while 
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called for a "strong and united response" from the EU. 
Lithuania and Latvia have called for international flights not to use Belarusian airspace.

The International Civil Aviation Organization -- the UN's civil aviation agency -- said the forced landing "could be in 
contravention of the Chicago Convention", which protects nations' airspace sovereignty. 
Minsk's airport had released a statement earlier saying the plane had to make an emergency landing there at 1215 
GMT following a bomb scare. 
"The plane was checked, no bomb was found and all passengers were sent for another security search," said 
Nexta, a Belarus opposition channel on the Telegram messaging app, which Protasevich previously edited.

Lukashenko's press service said on its own Telegram channel the president had given the order to divert the flight 
and had ordered a Mig-29 fighter jet to accompany the plane.

The incident comes as Belarus authorities intensify their crackdown on the opposition following historic protests that 
gripped the ex-Soviet country after last year's disputed presidential election. 
The United States "strongly condemned" the arrest, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling for Protasevich's 
release. 
"This shocking act perpetrated by the Lukashenka regime endangered the lives of more than 120 passengers, 
including US citizens," he said in a statement, using an alternative spelling of the Belarusian leader's name.

European leaders reacted with fury. In Athens, where the flight began, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted: 
"The forced landing of a commercial plane to detain a journalist is an unprecedented, shocking act." 
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda described Belarus's actions as "abhorrent" and prosecutors said they had 
opened a criminal investigation for the hijacking of a plane. 
The government in Ireland, where Ryanair is headquartered, described the incident as "absolutely unacceptable", 
while NATO called it "dangerous" and demanded an international investigation. 
Since last August's disputed election, Belarusians have taken to the streets demanding the resignation of 
Lukashenko, who has ruled for over two decades. 
Protasevich and Nexta founder Stepan Putilo, 22, were added to Belarus's list of "individuals involved in terrorist 
activity" last year. 
The two bloggers -- both now based in Poland -- were accused of causing mass unrest, an offence punishable by 
up to 15 years in jail. 
Belarus also labelled the Nexta Telegram channels and its logo "extremist" and ordered them blocked. 
With close to two million subscribers on Telegram, Nexta Live and its sister channel Nexta are prominent opposition 
channels and helped mobilise protesters. 
"It is absolutely obvious that this is an operation of secret services to capture the plane in order to detain activist 
and blogger Roman Protasevich," exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said on Telegram. 
The opposition says that Tikhanovskaya, who fled to neighbouring Lithuania after the election, was the true winner 
of last year's presidential vote. 
A member of the Nexta team, Tadeusz Giczan, tweeted that representatives of the Belarusian security agency had 
been on Protasevich's flight. 
"Then when the plane had entered Belarus airspace, the KGB officers initiated a fight with the Ryanair crew 
insisting there's an IED onboard," he said. 
A spokeswoman for state company Lithuanian Airports, Lina Beisine, told AFP that Minsk airport had said the flight 
was redirected "due to a conflict between a member of the crew and the passengers". 
Ryanair said the flight's crew had been notified by Belarus air traffic control of "a potential security threat on board" 
and were instructed to divert to Minsk, the "nearest" airport. 
The EU and the United States have sanctioned Lukashenko and dozens of officials and businessmen tied to his 
regime with asset freezes and visa bans. 
The opposition protests in Belarus, which left at least four people dead, have now subsided, but journalists and 
activists continue to receive prison sentences in the aftermath.

 Belarus forced a passenger plane carrying a wanted opposition activist to divert and land in its capital, provoking a 
furious outcry from world leaders who described it as an "act of state terrorism" ahead of an EU summit Monday 
expected to toughen sanctions on Minsk. 
Dissident journalist Roman Protasevich was detained on Sunday after Ryanair flight FR4978 was pulled from its 
Athens-to-Vilnius route and -- accompanied by a Belarusian fighter jet -- diverted to the capital city, state television 
reported. 
Passengers described seeing the 26-year-old, who had been living in Poland, looking nervous as the flight was 
diverted to Minsk. 
"He just turned to people and said he was facing the death penalty," Monika Simkiene, a 40-year-old Lithuanian,

Minsk's airport had released a statement earlier saying the plane had to make an emergency landing there at 1215 
GMT following a bomb scare. 
Global Outrage As Belarus Diverts Flight, Arrests Opposition Activist
"The plane was checked, no bomb was found and all passengers were sent for another security search," said 
Nexta, a Belarus opposition channel on the Telegram messaging app, which Protasevich previously edited. 
Lukashenko's press service said on its own Telegram channel the president had given the order to divert the flight 
and had ordered a MiG-29 fighter jet to accompany the plane.

It comes as Belarus authorities intensify their crackdown on the opposition following historic protests that gripped 
the ex-Soviet country after last year's disputed presidential election. 
The United States "strongly condemned" the arrest, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling for Protasevich's 
release. 
"This shocking act perpetrated by the Lukashenka regime endangered the lives of more than 120 passengers, 
including US citizens," he said in a statement, using an alternative spelling of the Belarusian leader's name.

He added on Twitter: "We demand an international investigation and are coordinating with our partners on next 
steps." 
European leaders reacted with fury. In Athens, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted: "The forced landing of a 
commercial plane to detain a journalist is an unprecedented, shocking act." 
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda described Belarus's actions as "abhorrent" and prosecutors said they had 
opened a criminal investigation for the hijacking of a plane. 
The government in Ireland, where Ryanair is headquartered, described the incident as "absolutely unacceptable", 
while NATO called it "dangerous" and demanded an international investigation. 
Since last August's disputed election, Belarusians have taken to the streets demanding the resignation of 
Lukashenko, who has ruled for over two decades. 
Protasevich and Nexta founder Stepan Putilo, 22, were added to Belarus's list of "individuals involved in terrorist 
activity" last year. 
The two -- both now based in Poland -- were accused of causing mass unrest, an offence punishable by up to 15 
years in jail. 
Belarus also labelled the Nexta Telegram channels and its logo "extremist" and ordered them blocked. 
With close to two million subscribers on Telegram, Nexta Live and its sister channel Nexta are prominent opposition 
channels and helped mobilise protesters. 
"It is absolutely obvious that this is an operation of secret services to capture the plane in order to detain activist 
and blogger Roman Protasevich," exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said on Telegram. 
The opposition says that Tikhanovskaya, who fled to neighbouring Lithuania after the election, was the true winner 
of last year's presidential vote. 
A member of the Nexta team, Tadeusz Giczan, tweeted that representatives of the Belarusian security agency had 
been on Protasevich's flight. 
"Then when the plane had entered Belarus airspace, the KGB officers initiated a fight with the Ryanair crew 
insisting there's an IED onboard," he said. 
A spokeswoman for state company Lithuanian Airports, Lina Beisine, told AFP that Minsk airport had said the flight 
was redirected "due to a conflict between a member of the crew and the passengers". 
In a statement -- that did not mention Protasevich -- Ryanair said the flight's crew had been notified by Belarus air 
traffic control of "a potential security threat on board" and were instructed to divert to Minsk, the "nearest" airport. 
The EU and the United States have sanctioned Lukashenko and dozens of officials and businessmen tied to his 
regime with asset freezes and visa bans.

The whereabouts of dissident Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich, who was taken into custody after a 
passenger plane he was on was forced to land in Minsk at the weekend, remain unknown on Monday.
Protasevich, a 26-year-old blogger and activist who was wanted in his homeland for inciting protests against long-
time leader Alexander Lukashenko, among other charges, was arrested after his Ryanair flight from Greece to 
Lithuania made an emergency landing on Sunday.
His father, Dmitry, said in an interview with Belarusian radio broadcaster Radio Svoboda that he was convinced that 
the careful operation did "not only involve" the country's secret service.
Russia is a close ally of Belarus.
"The operation was of a large enough scale to spit on the entire international community and their opinion," added 
the dissident's father, who called the forced landing "an act of terrorism."
"We are very worried about our son," said Dmitry Protasevich. "Unfortunately, we don't know where he is and how 
he's doing."
Governments across Europe reacted with outrage, suggesting authoritarian Belarus used the pretext of a safety 
threat to conduct a "state hijacking" of a civilian airliner to go after a critic.
Belarusian state media reported that the plane's diversion came on Lukashenko's personal instructions, after he 
had purportedly been alerted to a possible bomb on board. He also ordered a MiG-29 fighter jet be scrambled to 
accompany the Ryanair plane, according to the Belta news agency.
Lukashenko, 66, has led Belarus - a former Soviet republic in Eastern Europe bordering EU states Poland, 
Lithuania and Latvia - for more than a quarter of a century, tolerating little dissent.

May 24, 2021( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich, who was detained in Belarus after the Ryanair flight he was on was 
diverted and forced to land on Sunday, began his digital activism in his teens. 
A student at the time, he was arrested in 2012 aged just 17 for running two groups on the Russian-based social 
networking site Vkontakte against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. 
One of them was called "We are sick of this Lukashenko" -- the former collective farm manager who has ruled 
Belarus with an iron fist since 1994, a year before Protasevich was born. 
"They hit me in the kidneys and liver," Protasevich said at the time. 
"I urinated blood for three days afterwards. They threatened to accuse me of unsolved murders." 
During the interrogation, he said, officers from Belarus's security service, still named the KGB as in Soviet times, 
were demanding his passwords to the online groups. 
He later worked as a photographer for Belarusian media and was the recipient of a Vaclav Havel Journalism 
Fellowship in 2017-2018 -- an award for aspiring independent journalists named after the late Czech dissident 
turned president. 
 Protasevich left Belarus in 2019 after he started working for the highly influential pro-opposition Telegram channel 
Nexta ("Somebody" in Belarusian). 
He later became editor-in-chief at the channel, which currently has more than 1.2 million subscribers. 
The channel had a role in organising the anti-Lukashenko protests by sharing with its followers details on meeting 
times and dates.

Living between Poland and Lithuania, both hubs for Belarusian exiles, he has since become the editor of the 
channel BGM -- an acronym in Russian meaning "Smart Belarus" -- which has 260,000 subscribers. 
The 26-year-old's girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, who was detained with him, is a law student at the European Humanities 
University (EHU) in Vilnius. 
Protasevich covered the 2020 presidential election campaign in which opposition challenger Svetlana 
Tikhanovskaya took on Lukashenko. 
Unprecedented mass protests broke out after Lukashenko declared victory once again and the authorities 
responded with violence. 
Roman Protasevich: From Teen Activist To Regime Bugbear
Belarus issued a warrant for Protasevich's arrest in November over his work for Nexta, declaring that he was 
"involved in terrorist activity". 
On his Twitter profile, he mockingly describes himself as "history's first terrorist journalist". 
Terror offences can carry the death penalty in Belarus, which still carries out capital punishment. 
After the plane was diverted and coming in to land in Minsk on Sunday, passengers overheard him saying that "he 
was facing the death penalty". 
His latest tweet on May 16 was about photographing Tikhanovskaya's visit to Athens -- the city where the Ryanair 
flight left from on its way to Vilnius.

Ryanair group CEO Michael O'Leary expressed his concern that there remains a "real risk" that the European LCC 
might not acquire its initial batch of Boeing Max 8-200s before the peak of the summer season. O'Leary blamed 
Boeing's continuous mismanagement of the delivery process. "Over the medium term, I expect those delivery 
problems to be resolved and I am confident that we will take at least 60 of those aircraft in advance of summer 
2022. But in the short term there is nothing but a problem," O'Leary said on the 17 May in a prerecorded 
presentation following the release of the company's results for the financial year ended March 31. "And the problem 
does not lay with the FAA or EASA but with Boeing."
The airline had until now had remained supportive of Boeing throughout the MAX's grounding following two deadly 
crashes in 2019, but O'Leary now acknowledged he's currently "quite upset" with the OEM.
The FAA certified the high-density Boeing 737 Max 8-200 on 31 March and the EU Aviation Safety Agency 
validated the variant on 6 April. "We are now eight weeks later and we are still waiting for the first delivery," said 
O'Leary. "We are now being told by [Boeing] that the first delivery will be in late May. I am not sure we necessarily 
believe that."
The LCC had hoped to take delivery of 14 of the "game-changer" aircraft in advance of the upcoming peak summer 
season, "but as the management team in Seattle continues to mismanage that process, I think there is a real risk 
we might not see any of these aircraft in advance of summer 2021," he stated.

Calls to create a no-fly zone over Belarus' airspace and ban its planes from EU and British airports grew louder on 
Monday as European countries looked for ways to express their anger at Minsk's forced landing of a Ryanair flight 
with a dissident on board.
The whereabouts of dissident Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich, who was taken into custody after the 
passenger plane he was on was forced to land in Belarus' capital at the weekend, remain unknown.
Protasevich, a 26-year-old blogger and activist who was wanted in his homeland for inciting protests against long-
time leader Alexander Lukashenko, among other charges, was arrested after his Ryanair flight from Greece to 
Lithuania made an emergency landing on Sunday.
A Russian woman was also detained alongside Protasevich, the Russian embassy in Minsk said in a Facebook 
post. Multiple media outlets have reported that the woman is Protasevich's partner.
Governments across Europe have reacted with outrage, suggesting authoritarian Belarus used the pretext of a 
safety threat to conduct a "state hijacking" of a civilian airliner to go after a critic.
The European Union and Britain were considering punitive measures, including sanctions on those responsible for 
the incident, as well as a possible landing ban for the Belarusian airline Belavia at all airports and the declaration of 
the airspace over Belarus as a no-fly zone.
Leaders in Britain, Latvia, Poland and France are already pushing to close off Belarusian airspace to international 
flights.
Calls to block Belarus ' airspace grow as activist's location unknown
Airlines including Wizz Air and Air Baltic are rerouting their flights accordingly, while Poland's LOT airline said it was 
preparing to change flight paths.
Germany, Britain, Belgium and the Czech Republic are among those to have summoned Belarusian envoys based 
there to discuss the forced landing, with several European capitals calling for the immediate release of Protasevich.
"Beyond the diplomatic track, we're actively considering and co-ordinating with our allies on further sanctions on 
those responsible for this outlandish conduct," British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said.
EU leaders will meanwhile discuss possible measures at a summit later on Monday, while ambassadors from 
NATO member states will do the same on Tuesday.
A spokesperson for Belarus' Foreign Ministry said the former Soviet country was open to an international 
investigation into the forced landing, but defended Belarus' actions, saying it had fully complied with international 
regulations, and rejected EU criticism.
Russia also supported an international investigation.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov urged a "sober assessment" of the incident, noting that there are already 
calls for sanctions after a procedure which, he says, went according to international guidelines.
"We don't want to get involved in this race of condemning someone or supporting something," he said.
Belarusian state media reported that the plane's diversion came on Lukashenko's personal instructions, after he 
had purportedly been alerted to a possible bomb on board. He also ordered a MiG-29 fighter jet be scrambled to 
accompany the Ryanair plane, according to the Belta news agency.

the dissident's father, who called the forced landing "an act of terrorism."

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary believes that KGB agents were aboard the passenger flight that was 
forced to land in Minsk.
"It appears the intent of the authorities was to remove a journalist and his travelling companion," the head of the 
Irish budget airline told radio broadcaster Newstalk on Monday. "We believe there were some KGB agents 
offloaded at the airport as well," he added.
O'Leary praised the flight crew for handling the situation well and said the incident was frightening for passengers 
and staff, who were detained for hours by gunmen in Belarus after the emergency landing.
Ryanair said the matter was being handled by EU security authorities and NATO, and for security reasons he could 
not comment on it further.
Dmitry Protasevich expressed worry about his son: "Unfortunately, we don't know where he is and how he's doing."

The EU could decide to sanction Belarus on Monday evening when the 27 premiers meet in Brussels following the 
forced landing of a Ryanair flight and the arrest of a journalist.
On the table are, among other measures, targeted sanctions against people responsible for the forced landing of 
the commercial flight between Athens and Vilnius.
Dissident journalist Roman Protasevich, who had been on board, was taken into custody after the flight was 
diverted to the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on allegations of a bomb threat.
The manoeuvre caused international outrage. The bloc's foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell called it "yet another 
blatant attempt by the Belarusian authorities to silence all opposition voices."
"In carrying out this coercive act, the Belarusian authorities have jeopardised the safety of passengers and crew," 
he said, calling for an international investigation and for Protasevich to be released.
"The EU will consider the consequences of this action, including taking measures against those responsible."
Other options include banning national airline Belavia from landing at EU airports or ordering EU airlines to avoid 
Belarusian airspace, although this is legally more complicated than targeting individuals.
The EU summoned Belarusian ambassador Aleksandr Mikhnevich, during which he "was informed of the firm 
condemnation by the EU institutions," according to a statement.
The meeting in Brussels was initially scheduled to focus on debates on the bloc's strategy towards Russia, for 
example, and was expected to be relatively uneventful.
However, with Belarusian authorities having forced an EU airline flight between two EU countries to land, the 
premiers might feel forced to react strongly.

EU set to ban Belarus carriers after forced diversion

Following a meeting on May 24, 2021, the European Council has resolved to ban all Belarus airlines from landing in 
the European Union and from transiting its airspace. The Council's conclusions have also appealed to all EU 
airlines to avoid overflying Belarus. The European Council is a body comprising the heads of states and 
governments of all 27 EU member states. It does not, however, have direct legislative power and all of its 
conclusions need to be passed into law by other bodies, including the European Commission and the Council of the 
European Union. 
As such, the ban is not immediately effective. Flag carrier Belavia (B2, Minsk National) is the only Belarus airline 
operating scheduled flights to the European Union. According to the ch-aviation schedules module, the airline 
currently connects Minsk with 19 destinations in the bloc. Cargo specialists Rada Airlines, Rubystar Airways, 
BySky, and Genex all hold EASA Third Country Operator certificates, permitting them to operate charter flights. The 
conclusions were adopted in the wake of the state-backed hijacking of a B737-800 operated by Buzz on behalf of 
its parent Ryanair on May 23. The aircraft, en route from Athens Int'l to Vilnius, was notified by air traffic controllers 
of a potential bomb on board while in Belarus airspace and ordered to land at Minsk National, even though it was 
closer to Vilnius at that time. The Belarus Air Force scrambled a MiG-29 fighter to force the aircraft to divert to 
Minsk. Upon landing in the capital, independent journalist Roman Protasevich was detained. The aircraft, SP-RSM 
(msn 44791), departed for Vilnius after around seven hours on the ground. The Belarus authorities have since 
confirmed the order to force the aircraft to land were issued directly by President Aleksandr Lukashenko. Ahead of 
the Council's decisions, a number of countries and airlines have implemented their own bans affecting air traffic 
with Belarus. airBaltic (BT, Riga) was the first airline to formally announce it would avoid Belarus airspace from now 
on. "As an immediate action, airBaltic has decided to avoid entering Belarus airspace until the situation becomes 
clearer or a decision is issued by the authorities... On May 23, airBaltic followed the European Union Aviation 
Safety Agency (EASA) recommendation as a precautionary measure to exercise caution when operating within or 
over Minsk," the Latvian carrier said. Due to prevailing network cuts, the decision has so far impacted a limited 
number of flights, including a service from Tbilisi to Riga and a round-trip from Riga to Odesa, where its flight paths 
avoided Belarus airspace altogether. Most of airBaltic's European routes do not transit Belarus airspace. Wizz Air 
and Lufthansa have also resolved to avoid overflying Belarus and, in Lufthansa's case, suspended services to 
Minsk. Lufthansa's last departure from Minsk on May 24 was delayed for two hours due to a false bomb alarm. 
airBaltic, Lufthansa, and Poland's LOT Polish Airlines are the only European Union carriers that operate scheduled 
flights to Minsk. Lithuania's Minister of Transport, Marius Skuodis, said the country would not permit the landing or 
departure of any aircraft that has crossed, or intends to cross, into Belarus airspace. Ukraine has issued a similar 
EU set to ban Belarus carriers after forced diversion
ban. The UK Secretary of State for Transport, Grant Shapps, has announced that the UK would advise, via the Civil 
Aviation Authority, all of its airlines to avoid Belarus airspace. He said that it would also revoke Belavia's operating 
permit. The state-owned airline operates 3x weekly between London Gatwick and Minsk using E195 regional jets, 
the ch-aviation schedules module shows.

       European stocks closed higher on Monday as continued optimism about global economic recovery and the 
momentum in vaccination drive outweighing concerns over inflation and fears about any monetary tightening by 
central banks.
 Worries about coronavirus cases in Europe are subsiding with several countries in the region reporting a drop new 
cases and set to ease all or most of the restrictions by the end of next month. France reported its lowest daily death 
toll in several months, and new cases were down to lowest levels in about five months.
 Investors were also closely following cryptocurrencies movements, geopolitical issues, and the forced landing of a 
Ryanair flight in Belarus.
 Stocks pared early gains and briefly fell into the red midway through the session, but rebounded and closed higher, 
taking cues from Wall Street where the mood was fairly bullish.
 The pan European Stoxx 600 advanced 0.14%. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 climbed 0.48% and France's CAC 40 gained 
0.35%.
 Several markets in Europe, including Germany, Switzerland, Denmark and Austria, were closed for Whit Monday 
holiday.
 Belgium, Greece, Ireland, Netherlands and Sweden closed higher. Finland, Poland and Portugal drifted lower, 
while Czech Republic, Russia, Spain and Turkey ended flat.
 In the French market, Unibail Rodamco gained nearly 3%. Capgemini, Safran, Renault, Hermes International, 
Accor, Valeo and LOreal posted strong gains.
 Engie ended nearly 4% down. BNP Paribas, Technip and Credit Agricole also closed weak.
 In the UK market, Compass Group, Pershing Square Holdings, Entain, Flutter Entertainment, IHG, ICP, Whitbread, 
Vodafone Group, British Land Company, Spirax-Sacro Engineering, WPP, BP, Hikma Pharmaceuticals and BT 
Group gained 1 to 3%.
 Cineworld shares rallied sharply after the company said its U.K. cinemas attracted more people than expected in 
its first weekend of reopening, following a months-long lockdown.
 Fresnillo, Admiral Group, Antofagasta and BHP Group ended notably lower.
 In the Swedish market, shares of Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson fell 1.6 percent. The company said 
that there is a risk that the decision by the Post and Telecommunication Authority to exclude Chinese vendors' 
products from the 5G auction in Sweden may adversely impact its economic interests.
European Stocks Close Higher
 Shares of Irish low-cost airliner Ryanair gained about 0.5%. Belarusian opposition activist Roman Protasevich was 
arrested after a Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania was forced to land in Belarus over an alleged bomb scare.

 A defiant Belarus on Monday defended its forced diversion of a European plane carrying an opposition activist, 
after the unprecedented move provoked a global outcry and calls for a tough response. 
The Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius carrying dissident journalist Roman Protasevich was diverted while in 
Belarusian airspace on Sunday over a supposed bomb threat. 
Accompanied by a Belarusian fighter jet, it landed in the capital Minsk where Protasevich, a 26-year-old who had 
been living between EU states Poland and Lithuania, was arrested along with his girlfriend.

Accusing strongman Alexander Lukashenko's regime of essentially hijacking a European plane, Western leaders 
insisted the move would not go unanswered. 
Many in Europe called for tough new sanctions to be agreed at a pre-planned summit on Monday, while 
Washington denounced the "shocking act" and demanded Protasevich's release. 
In its first official reaction to the incident, Belarus's foreign ministry insisted the country had acted legally and 
accused the West of trying to play politics.

"There is no doubt that the actions of our competent authorities... fully met established international rules," ministry 
spokesman Anatoly Glaz said in a statement, accusing the West of "politicising" the situation. 
 "Unfounded accusations are being made," he said.

The EU and other Western countries have already imposed a wide range of sanctions on Lukashenko's 
government over a brutal crackdown on opposition demonstrations that followed his disputed re-election to a sixth 
term last August. 
Together with co-founder Stepan Putilo, Protasevich until recently ran the Nexta telegram channel that galvanised 
and directed the protests, which were the biggest challenge to Lukashenko's rule since he took power in the ex-
Soviet country in 1994. 
Defiant Belarus Defends Diversion Of Plane Carrying Activist
The diversion of the plane was roundly condemned in Europe, with EU chief Ursula von der Leyen describing it as 
"outrageous and illegal", Poland denouncing it as "an act of state terrorism" and France calling for a "strong and 
united response".

NATO demanded a probe into the "serious and dangerous incident" while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken 
called it "a shocking act" that "endangered the lives of more than 120 passengers, including US citizens". 
Belarus's main ally Russia showed little concern however, with foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova 
mocking the Western indignation. 
"We are shocked that the West calls the incident in Belarusian air space 'shocking,'" Zakharova said on Facebook, 
accusing Western nations of "kidnappings, forced landings and illegal arrests".

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to comment on the incident, saying it was up to international aviation 
authorities to evaluate what had happened. 
Latvia-based regional airline airBaltic said it would now be avoiding Belarusian airspace. 
With close to two million subscribers on Telegram, Nexta Live and its sister channel Nexta are prominent opposition 
channels and helped mobilise protesters in Belarus. 
Protasevich and Putilo were added to Belarus's list of "individuals involved in terrorist activity" last year. 
The two were accused of causing mass unrest, an offence punishable by up to 15 years in jail. 
"It is absolutely obvious that this is an operation of secret services to capture the plane in order to detain activist 
and blogger Roman Protasevich," exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said on Telegram. 
The opposition says that Tikhanovskaya, who fled to neighbouring Lithuania after last year's presidential election, 
was the true winner of the vote. 
A member of the Nexta team, Tadeusz Giczan, tweeted that representatives of the Belarusian security agency had 
been on Protasevich's flight. 
"Then when the plane had entered Belarus airspace, the KGB officers initiated a fight with the Ryanair crew 
insisting there's an IED (improvised explosive device) onboard," he said. 
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said it appeared that agents of the Belarusian KGB were on the plane and 
also deboarded in Minsk. 
"I think it's the first time it's happened to a European airline," O'Leary told Ireland's Newstalk radio. "It was a state-
sponsored hijacking, it was state-sponsored piracy." 
Passengers described seeing Protasevich looking nervous as the flight was diverted to Minsk. 
"He started panicking and saying this was because of him," Monika Simkiene, a 40-year-old Lithuanian, told AFP 
after the plane finally landed in Vilnius several hours later than its scheduled arrival time. 
"He just turned to people and said he was facing the death penalty."

EU leaders weigh Belarus sanctions after forced landing 'scandal'
EU leaders weigh Belarus sanctions after forced landing 'scandal'

The European Union could decide to sanction Belarus once again on Monday evening after the country forced a 
Ryanair flight to land and detained a Belarusian opposition journalist on board.
The incident, which interrupted a flight between two EU countries, has leapt onto the agenda of a Brussels summit 
at the last minute, souring relations between Minsk and the bloc even further.
European Council President Charles Michel slammed the move by Minsk as an "international scandal" that put the 
lives of European civilians at risk.
EU officials were drafting a variety of punitive measures for the bloc to consider, Michel said. "I hope tonight we can 
make a decision on that," he told journalists before the summit.
One possibility is targeted sanctions against people responsible for what EU governments and officials said was a 
state "hijacking" of a commercial flight between Athens and Vilnius on Sunday.
This would be the fourth round of punitive measures since October.
The member states could also ban national airline Belavia from landing at EU airports or order EU airlines to avoid 
Belarusian airspace. This is legally more complicated than targeting individuals, however.
Dissident journalist Roman Protasevich, who had been on board, was taken into custody after the flight was 
diverted to the Belarusian capital on allegations of a bomb threat.
The manoeuvre caused international outrage. The bloc's foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell called it "yet another 
blatant attempt by the Belarusian authorities to silence all opposition voices."
EU leaders weigh Belarus sanctions after forced landing 'scandal'
"In carrying out this coercive act, the Belarusian authorities have jeopardised the safety of passengers and crew," 
he said, calling for an international investigation and for 26-year-old Protasevich to be released.
Belarus said it is open to an international investigation into the forced landing. Foreign Ministry spokesperson 
Anatoly Glass rejected EU criticism saying Minsk had had fully complied with international regulations.
Belarus has seen months of protests - matched with a dogged crackdown - after authoritarian President Alexander 
Lukashenko claimed victory in an election in August last year that the opposition sees as rigged.
Since the poll, which the EU maintains was neither free nor fair, the bloc has imposed sanctions over several 
rounds. The total of targeted individuals is currently 88, including Lukashenko himself, plus seven entities.
The 66-year-old has led Belarus - a former Soviet republic in Eastern Europe bordering EU states Poland, Lithuania 
and Latvia - for more than a quarter of a century, tolerating little dissent.
NATO ambassadors were set to discuss the matter on Tuesday. Britain is also weighing sanctions.
The EU summoned Belarusian ambassador Aleksandr Mikhnevich, during which he "was informed of the firm 
condemnation by the EU institutions," according to a statement. Several member states also hauled in Belarusian 
envoys bilaterally.
The Brussels summit was initially scheduled to focus on debates on the bloc's strategy towards Russia, for 
example, and was expected to be relatively uneventful.
Minsk has grown closer to Moscow in recent years. But Lukashenko has also maintained relations with EU partners 
in his almost 27 years in power.

 Pressure was building Monday for a tough international response to Belarus's forced landing of a European airliner 
so it could arrest an opposition activist. 
The Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius carrying dissident journalist Roman Protasevich was diverted while in 
Belarusian airspace on Sunday over a supposed bomb threat. 
Accompanied by a Belarusian fighter jet on the orders of strongman Alexander Lukashenko, the plane landed in the 
capital Minsk where Protasevich, a 26-year-old who had been living in Lithuania, was arrested along with his 
Russian girlfriend.

The unprecedented move sparked an international outcry, with Western leaders accusing Belarusian authorities of 
essentially hijacking a European plane. 
As EU leaders prepared to meet for a summit later on Monday, Brussels said it had summoned the Belarusian 
ambassador to condemn the "coercive act". 
Belarus's exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said Protasevich's life was in danger, calling for an 
international investigation and concrete steps against the regime. 
"The time for statements has passed -- obviously Belarusians expect decisive actions and assistance from the 
international community," she said in a video statement.

spokeswoman Maria Zakharova mocked the Western indignation. 
"We are shocked that the West calls the incident in Belarusian air space 'shocking,'" Zakharova said on Facebook, 
accusing Western nations of "kidnappings, forced landings and illegal arrests". 
The International Civil Aviation Organization -- the UN's civil aviation agency -- said the forced landing could be in 
contravention of the Chicago Convention, which protects nations' airspace sovereignty. 
Some in Europe were already taking steps, with Lithuania saying it would not authorise any flights that cross 
Belarusian territory and Latvia-based regional airline airBaltic saying it would now be avoiding the country's 
airspace. 
EU leaders will debate tougher sanctions against Belarus on Monday, with Lithuania and France calling for 
Belarusian airspace to be blocked and aircraft from the country stopped from landing in EU airports. 
The bloc was already working on a new round of measures that was expected to see dozens more officials added 
to an asset freeze and visa ban blacklist in the coming weeks. 
Those sanctions could now be expedited and Brussels is expected to propose more measures in response to the 
forced landing, an EU source said. 
"We are assessing the situation and do not rule out any action," the source said.

Atran (V8, Moscow Vnukovo) has dry-leased two more B737-800(BCF)s from GECAS, adding the pair already 
delivered to the Russian cargo specialist in 2018 and 2019. VQ-BFR (msn 33548), the first of the two newly 
contracted jets, underwent conversion at Jinan before heading to Ostrava for pre-delivery repainting over the 
course of May 9-10, 2021. It was subsequently delivered to Moscow Vnukovo on May 20, Flightradar24 ADS-B data 
shows. The other aircraft, VQ-BFX (msn 33717), remains at Jinan airport and will be delivered to Atran by month-
end, GECAS said. Both aircraft are over 18 years old and operated for Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) in a passenger 
configuration until 2020 when they were retired ahead of P2F conversion, the ch-aviation fleets history module 
shows. 
Besides the other two B737-800(BCF)s, also on lease from GECAS, Atran also operates three B737-400(F)s (two 
leased from Vx Capital Partners and one from SberLeasing). The airline is a narrowbody subsidiary of Volga-Dnepr 
Group, a holding which also owns three widebody freighter operators (AirBridgeCargo, Volga-Dnepr Airlines, and 
CargoLogicAir), as well as a German narrowbody unit CargoLogic Germany. Atran specialises in short- and 
medium-haul routes linking Europe, China, Russia, and the CIS.

EU could seal off skies to Belarusian airlines after forced landing

The European Union could decide on Monday evening to seal off its airspace off to Belarusian airlines after the 
country forced a Ryanair flight to land and detained a Belarusian opposition journalist on board.
According to a draft document seen by dpa, EU leaders could also call on all EU-based airlines to avoid flying over 
the state's territory following what several officials and governments have slammed as either "state hijacking" or 
even "terrorism."
If implemented, state airline Belavia would have to cancel its flights to a host of cities, including to Berlin, Paris, and 
Brussels. It would also likely have to re-route its flights to for example Tunisia, as the most direct flight path crosses 
EU air space.
The incident, which interrupted a flight between EU countries Greece and Lithuania on Sunday, leapt onto the 
agenda of a Brussels summit at the last minute and soured relations with the authoritarian government even further.
The 27 leaders are now examining various sanctions options, which according to European Commission President 
Urusla von der Leyen include targeting the Belarusian aviation sector, businesses that support the country's 
"regime" and people involved in the diversion.
Dissident journalist Roman Protasevich, who had been on board, was taken into custody after the flight was 
diverted to the Belarusian capital on allegations of a bomb threat. No bomb was found.
The 26-year-old has been taken into pre-trial detention, Belarusian authorities confirmed on Monday.
Lithuania's president Gitanas Nauseda calling the forced landing "abhorrent" and said that Belarusian airspace 
could be declared unsafe.

Similarly, Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin called the diversion "appalling, reckless and unacceptable."
If the draft leaders' statement seen by dpa is adopted, the bloc will also call on the International Civil Aviation 
Organization to "urgently investigate" the incident.
One EU diplomat told dpa they believed all member states supported the statement.
Von der Leyen was among those calling for Protasevich's release. "We will put pressure on the regime as long as it 
finally respects the freedom of media ... and the freedom of opinion," she told reporters before the summit.
A 3-billion-euro (3.7-billion-dollar) EU investment and economic package planned for Belarus is frozen until the 
country "turns democratic," she added.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also demanded the release of Protasevich's partner, Sofia Sapega, who is 
believed to have been detained along with him.
No bomb was found aboard and Merkel said all of Minsk's explanations for the manoeuvre so far had been "totally 
unbelievable."
Belarus said it is open to an international investigation into the forced landing. Foreign Ministry spokesperson 
Anatoly Glass rejected EU criticism, and said that Minsk had fully complied with international regulations.
Belarus has seen months of protests - matched by a dogged crackdown - after authoritarian President Alexander 
Lukashenko claimed victory in an election in August last year that the opposition sees as rigged.

 EU leaders agreed to cut air links with Belarus on Monday, as leader Alexander Lukashenko's regime paraded a 
dissident journalist arrested after his flight was forced to land in Minsk. 
Strongman Lukashenko sparked international outrage by dispatching a fighter jet Sunday to intercept a Ryanair 
flight from Athens to Vilnius carrying wanted reporter Roman Protasevich, 26, and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega. 
European leaders meeting in Brussels hit back by agreeing to ban Belarusian airlines from the bloc's airspace and 
urged EU-based carriers not to fly over its airspace. 
The bloc also said it would adopt further "targeted economic sanctions" against the Belarusian authorities to add to 
the 88 regime figures and seven companies already on a blacklist over a crackdown on opposition. 
 Belarusian opposition activist Roman Protasevitch, 26, had been living in exile in Poland Photo: AFP / STR  
The move came as Belarusian state television broadcast a 30-second video of Protasevich, who had been living 
between Lithuania and Poland, confirming that he was in prison in Minsk and "confessing" to charges of organising 
mass unrest. 
The footage showed Protasevich -- who could face 15 years in jail -- with dark markings visible on his forehead, 
saying he was being treated "according to the law". 
"This is how (Roman) looks under physical and moral pressure," exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana 
Tikhanovskaya wrote on Twitter. 
 The EU leaders demanded the "immediate release" of Protasevich and Sapega, the conclusions of the summit 
said.

The forced landing of an airliner flying between EU nations has refocused attention on the festering political crisis in 
Belarus, where Lukashenko has unleashed waves of brutal repression to cling to power. 
Western leaders accused Belarusian authorities of essentially hijacking a European plane, while Minsk claimed it 
had reacted to secure the flight after receiving a bomb threat.

"It is outrageous behaviour and Lukashenko and his regime have to understand that this will have severe 
consequences," EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said. 
EU Cuts Air Links With Belarus Over Forced Plane Landing
The EU's push to punish Minsk followed announcements from some nations and airlines that they were cutting links 
to Belarus. 
London also said it had issued instructions for British aircraft to avoid Belarusian airspace. 
Ukraine said it would halt direct flights between the two countries and over Belarus, while Scandinavian airline SAS, 
Germany's Lufthansa and Latvia-based regional airline Air Baltic said they would be avoiding Belarusian airspace.

In a bid to heighten pressure on Lukashenko, Berlin, London and Brussels summoned the Belarusian 
ambassadors. 
Belarus has insisted it acted legally over the grounding of the Ryanair jet, accusing the West of making "unfounded 
accusations" for political reasons.

Its air force chief said the plane's captain had decided to land in Belarus "without outside interference" and that the 
pilot could have chosen to go to Ukraine or Poland. 
A senior Belarusian transport official said the authorities received a letter claiming to be from the Palestinian 
Islamist group Hamas threatening to blow up the plane over Vilnius unless the EU renounced support for Israel. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel dismissed Minsk's explanations as "completely implausible" and the EU 
demanded a probe by the International Civil Aviation Organization. 
The ICAO, a UN agency, is to meet on Thursday. 
United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres backed calls for a "full, transparent and independent 
investigation into this disturbing incident". 
NATO slammed a "serious and dangerous incident" and said envoys from the military alliance were to discuss it on 
Tuesday. 
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called it "a shocking act". 
The EU and other Western countries have already imposed a wide range of sanctions on Lukashenko's 
government over its crackdown on opposition demonstrations that followed his disputed re-election to a sixth term 
last August. 
But Lukashenko has remained defiant with help from his main backer Russia. 
Britain's Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab raised the possibility of that Russian had backed the operation. 
"It's very difficult to believe that this kind of action could have been taken without at least the acquiescence of the 
authorities in Moscow," he told parliament. 
But Moscow has dismissed the outrage in the West. 
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Minsk was taking an "absolutely reasonable approach" while ministry 
spokeswoman Maria Zakharova mocked the Western indignation. 
"We are shocked that the West calls the incident in Belarusian air space 'shocking,'" Zakharova said on Facebook, 
accusing Western nations of "kidnappings, forced landings and illegal arrests". 
Together with co-founder Stepan Putilo, Protasevich until recently ran the Nexta channel on messaging app 
Telegram, which helped organise the protests that were the biggest challenge to Lukashenko's 26-year rule. 
With close to two million subscribers on Telegram, Nexta Live and its sister channel Nexta are prominent opposition 
channels and helped mobilise protesters in Belarus. 
The spiralling tensions around Belarus were in evidence as Minsk expelled the entire staff of Latvia's embassy, 
including the ambassador, after accusing Latvian authorities of having used an opposition flag at an ice hockey 
championship.

The European Union is readying to seal off its airspace and airports to Belarusian airlines after a flight between two 
EU states was forcibly diverted to Minsk.
In a statement published late on Monday, the bloc instructed officials to "adopt necessary measures to ban 
overflight of EU airspace by Belarusian airlines and prevent access to EU airports."
The 27 leaders also urged all EU-based carriers to avoid flying over Belarusian territory in the joint declaration, 
approved at a summit in Brussels.
Once implemented, state airline Belavia will not be able to fly to a host of cities, including to Berlin, Paris and 
Brussels. It will also likely have to re-route its flights to, for example, Tunisia, as the most direct flight path crosses 
EU air space.
The member states demanded the release of detained Belarusian opposition journalist Roman Protasevich and his 
partner Sofia Sapega.
The incident, which interrupted a Ryanair flight between EU countries Greece and Lithuania on Sunday, leapt onto

Dissident journalist Protasevich, who had been on board, was taken into custody after the flight was diverted to the 
Belarusian capital on allegations of a bomb threat. No bomb was found.
The 26-year-old has been taken into pre-trial detention, Belarusian authorities confirmed on Monday.
EU to seal off skies to Belarusian air traffic after flight diversion
The EU also decided to sanction Belarusian individuals after the forced diversion, which some leaders have 
slammed as a "state hijacking." A list of individuals and companies will be drawn up at a later stage.
According to a tweet by European Commission President Urusla von der Leyen, which was sent out before the 
meeting, this could include targeting the Belarusian aviation sector, businesses that support the country's "regime" 
and people involved in the diversion.
In addition, a package of economic sanctions should be prepared, the EU statement continued.
The punitive measures were agreed on relatively quickly after leaders headed into their meeting on Monday 
evening, with multiple premiers having publicly voiced their support for sanctions throughout the day.
Lithuania's President Gitanas Nauseda called the forced landing "abhorrent." Similarly, Irish Prime Minister Micheal 
Martin called the diversion "appalling, reckless and unacceptable."
The incident also has implications for the country's EU funds. A 3-billion-euro (3.7-billion-dollar) EU investment and 
economic package planned for Belarus is frozen until the country "turns democratic," von der Leyen said.
The EU member states also called on the International Civil Aviation Organization to "urgently investigate" the 
incident.
Prior to the EU leaders' meeting, Belarus said it is open to an international investigation into the forced landing. 
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Anatoly Glass rejected EU criticism, and said that Minsk had fully complied with 
international regulations.
But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said all of Minsk's explanations for the manoeuvre so far had been "totally 
unbelievable."
Belarus has seen months of protests - matched by a dogged crackdown - after authoritarian President Alexander 
Lukashenko claimed victory in an election in August last year that the opposition sees as rigged.
Since the poll, which the EU maintains was neither free nor fair, the bloc has imposed sanctions over several 
rounds for human rights breaches. The total of targeted individuals is currently 88, including Lukashenko himself, 
plus seven entities.
The 66-year-old has led Belarus - a former Soviet republic in Eastern Europe bordering EU states Poland, Lithuania 
and Latvia - for more than a quarter of a century, tolerating little dissent.
Minsk has grown closer to Moscow in recent years. But Lukashenko has also maintained relations with EU partners 
in his almost 27 years in power.
Having agreed on their stance towards Belarus, the EU leaders are set to discuss other foreign relations, such as 
their strategy towards Russia, throughout the evening.

       European stocks rose on Monday to hover near record highs, as investors weighed inflation concerns against 
optimism over the global economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
 The focus remains on the volatility in the cryptocurrency space as well as key U.S. inflation readings due this week, 
with a high reading for the core inflation figures expected to revive talk of an early tapering by the U.S. Federal 
Reserve.
 The pan European Stoxx 600 rose half a percent to 444.29 in thin trade, with markets in Austria, Denmark, 
Hungary, Norway, Switzerland and Germany closed for holiday.
 France's CAC 40 index edged up 0.1 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was up 0.3 percent.
 Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson fell 1.6 percent. The company said that there is a risk that the 
decision by the Post and Telecommunication Authority to exclude Chinese vendors' products from the 5G auction in 
Sweden may adversely impact its economic interests.
 Cineworld rallied 3.4 percent in London. The company said its U.K. cinemas attracted more people than expected 
in its first weekend of reopening, following a months-long lockdown.
 Airline Wizz Air Holdings edged up 0.3 percent and easyJet gained more than 1 percent despite Germany's public 
health institute on Friday declaring Britain and Northern Ireland a virus variant region.
 Ryanair rose half a percent. Belarusian opposition activist Roman Protasevich was arrested after a Ryanair flight 
from Greece to Lithuania was forced to land in Belarus over an alleged bomb scare.
 Clothing retailer Ted Baker was little changed after reiterating its 2023 financial targets.

 European countries began banning flights over Belarus Monday after it provoked an international outcry by forcing 
a commercial airliner to land so it could arrest an opposition activist. 
The Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius carrying dissident journalist Roman Protasevich was diverted while in 
Belarusian airspace on Sunday over a supposed bomb threat. 
Accompanied by a Belarusian fighter jet on the orders of strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko, the plane 
landed in the capital Minsk. There Protasevich, a 26-year-old, who had been living between Lithuania and Poland, 
was arrested along with his Russian girlfriend.

Western leaders accused Belarusian authorities of essentially hijacking a European plane, while Minsk claimed it 
had received a threat from Islamist group Hamas to blow up the aircraft. 
As EU leaders prepared to meet for a summit where they are expected to discuss new sanctions, several 
governments and airlines said they were stopping flights over or with Belarus. 
Britain and Lithuania said they had issued instructions for their countries' aircraft to avoid Belarusian airspace, with 
London going a step further by banning Belarus's flag carrier Belavia. 
Ukraine said it would halt direct flights between the two countries and over Belarus, while Scandinavian airline SAS 
and Latvia-based regional airline airBaltic said they would be avoiding Belarusian airspace.

 Berlin, London and Brussels summoned the Belarusian ambassadors, as exiled opposition leader Svetlana 
Tikhanovskaya called for an independent probe, new sanctions and for Minsk to be excluded from international 
aviation bodies.

"An act of state terrorism was carried out and now any passengers flying over Belarus in a civilian aircraft will be in 
danger," Tikhanovskaya told reporters in Vilnius. 
"The regime has turned our country into North Korea in the middle of Europe," she said. 
Pressure Mounts On Belarus Over Forced Landing To Arrest Dissident
The EU and other Western countries have already imposed a wide range of sanctions on Lukashenko's 
government over a brutal crackdown on opposition demonstrations that followed his disputed re-election to a sixth 
term last August. 
Together with co-founder Stepan Putilo, Protasevich until recently ran the Nexta telegram channel that helped 
organise protests that were the biggest challenge to Lukashenko's rule since he took power in the ex-Soviet country 
in 1994.

Belarus insisted it had acted legally, accusing the West of making "unfounded accusations" for political reasons. 
Its air force chief said the plane's captain had decided to land in Belarus "without outside interference" and that the 
pilot could have chosen to go to Ukraine or Poland. 
A senior transport official, Artem Sikorsky, told journalists that authorities in Minsk had received a letter claiming to 
be from Hamas threatening to blow up the plane over Vilnius unless the EU renounced support for Israel.

The diversion of the plane has been roundly condemned in Europe. 
EU chief Ursula von der Leyen described it as "outrageous and illegal", Poland denounced it as "an act of state 
terrorism" and France called for a "strong and united response". 
NATO demanded a probe into the "serious and dangerous incident" and alliance envoys were to discuss it on 
Tuesday. 
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called it "a shocking act" that "endangered the lives of more than 120 
passengers, including US citizens". 
Belarus's main ally Russia showed little concern, however. 
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Minsk was taking an "absolutely reasonable approach" while ministry 
spokeswoman Maria Zakharova mocked the Western indignation. 
"We are shocked that the West calls the incident in Belarusian air space 'shocking,'" Zakharova said on Facebook, 
accusing Western nations of "kidnappings, forced landings and illegal arrests". 
Britain's Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab raised the possibility of Russian backing for the diversion. 
"It's very difficult to believe that this kind of action could have been taken without at least the acquiescence of the 
authorities in Moscow," he told parliament. 
Even before Monday's summit, the EU was working on a new round of measures that was expected to see dozens 
more officials added to an asset freeze and visa ban blacklist in the coming weeks. 
Those sanctions could now be expedited and Brussels is expected to propose more measures in response to the 
forced landing, an EU source said. 
"We are assessing the situation and do not rule out any action," the source said. 
The growing tensions were in evidence as Belarus expelled the entire staff of Latvia's embassy, including the 
ambassador, after accusing Latvian authorities of having used an opposition flag at an ice hockey championship. 
With close to two million subscribers on Telegram, Nexta Live and its sister channel Nexta are prominent opposition 
channels and helped mobilise protesters in Belarus. 
The two were accused of causing mass unrest, an offence punishable by up to 15 years in jail.

European leaders have called for an immediate international response after Belarus forced a Ryanair flight bound 
for Lithuania to land in Minsk yesterday and arrested one of its passengers, a top opposition activist.
State media said Roman Protasevich, resident in Lithuania, was detained in the Belarusian capital after a flight from 
Athens to Vilnius was unexpectedly diverted shortly before leaving Bela- rusian airspace.
Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said that the forced landing was "utterly unacceptable". 
She wrote on Twitter: "Any violation of international air transport rules must bear consequences."
Dominic Raab, Britain's foreign secretary, said the UK was "alarmed" at reports of the forced landing and 
Protasevich's arrest, adding: "We are coordinating with our allies. This outlandish action by [Belarusian president 
Alexander] Lukashenko will have serious implications."
President Gitanas Nauseda of Lithuania called on Nato and the EU to "immediately react", while Polish prime 
minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that he would demand sanctions against Belarus. "Hijacking of a civilian plane is 
an unprecedented act of state terrorism. It cannot go unpunished," Morawiecki wrote on Twitter.

Protasevich, 26, is the former editor of Nexta, the Warsaw-based media group that played a prominent role in both 
covering and directing huge protests that erupted against Lukashenko last year after he claimed victory in a deeply 
flawed election.
"From now - no one flying over Belarus can be secure," Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Belarus's exiled opposition 
leader, wrote on Twitter.
Lukashenko personally gave an "irrevocable command to turn the plane around and land it" before it left the 
country's airspace, according to a post on a semi-official presidential channel on messaging app Telegram.
In November, Belarus placed Protasevich on a terrorist watchlist and charged him with three protest-related crimes, 
the most serious of which carries a sentence of up to 15 years in prison.
Ryanair said the flight crew were "notified by Belarus [air traffic control] of a potential security threat on board" and 
instructed to divert to Minsk.
"Nothing untoward was found and authorities cleared the aircraft to depart together with passengers and crew after 
approximately five hours on the ground in Minsk," it said in a statement.
Hundreds of thousands of Belarusians took to the streets last year in an unprecedented show of discontent after
Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for 27 years, claimed victory over Tsikhanouskaya in the 
disputed presidential election.
Most of the opposition's main figures have since either been forced into exile, such as Tsikhanouskaya, who is 
based in Lithuania, or imprisoned.

 Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned Belarus' diversion of a commercial plane and subsequent arrest of 
opposition leader Raman Pratasevich in a statement[1] Sunday, and called for Pratasevich's "immediate release." 
State of play: Blinken said the U.S. is working with its partners to coordinate a response and he supports the "the 
earliest possible meeting" of the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization to investigate the matter. 
The big picture: A Ryanair flight en route from Greece to Lithuania was forced by Belarusian air control to land[2] in 
Belarus' capital Minsk Sunday, under the pretext of a "a potential security risk on board." Belarusian authorities then 
detained Pratasevich, a journalist and activist who was critical in organizing mass anti-government protests in 
Belarus last year.Belarus' actions have been described a "hijacking" by some European leaders, who have vowed 
the country will face consequences. What they're saying: "The United States strongly condemns the forced 
diversion of a flight between two EU member states and the subsequent removal and arrest of journalist Raman 
Pratasevich in Minsk. We demand his immediate release," Blinken said in the statement. "This shocking act 
perpetrated by the Lukashenka regime endangered the lives of more than 120 passengers, including U.S. citizens." 
The bottom line: "The United States once again condemns the Lukashenka regime's ongoing harassment and 
arbitrary detention of journalists," Blinken said. "We stand with the Belarusian people in their aspirations for a free, 
democratic, and prosperous future and support their call for the regime to respect human rights and fundamental 
freedoms."

 Belarus forced a passenger plane carrying a wanted opposition activist to divert and land in its capital, provoking a 
furious outcry from world leaders who described it as an 'act of state terrorism' ahead of an EU summit Monday 
expected to toughen sanctions on Minsk. 
 Dissident journalist Roman Protasevich was detained on Sunday after Ryanair flight FR4978 was pulled from its 
Athens-to-Vilnius route and — accompanied by a Belarusian fighter jet — diverted to the capital city, state television 
reported. 
 Passengers described seeing the 26-year-old, who had been living in Poland, looking nervous as the flight was 
diverted to Minsk. 
 'He just turned to people and said he was facing the death penalty,' Monika Simkiene, a 40-year-old Lithuanian, 
told AFP in Vilnius after landing — without Protasevich — several hours later. 
 Edvinas Dimsa, 37, said: 'He was not screaming, but it was clear that he was very much afraid. It looked like if the 
window had been open, he would have jumped out of it.' 
 The incident comes as the European Union is set to discuss toughening its existing sanctions against Belarus, 
imposed over the crackdown by the regime of President Alexander Lukashenko on opposition protesters, at a pre-
planned summit on Monday. 
 'The outrageous and illegal behaviour of the regime in Belarus will have consequences,' EU chief Ursula von der 
Leyen tweeted, calling for Protasevich's release, and adding those responsible 'must be sanctioned'. 
 Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki denounced Belarus's actions as 'an act of state terrorism', while 
French Foreign MinisterJean-Yves Le Drian called for a 'strong and united response' from the EU. 
 Lithuania and Latvia have called for international flights not to use Belarusian airspace. 
 The International Civil Aviation Organization — the UN's civil aviation agency — said the forced landing 'could be in 
contravention of the Chicago Convention', which protects nations' airspace sovereignty. 
 Minsk's airport had released a statement earlier saying the plane had to make an emergency landing there at 1215 
GMT following a bomb scare. 
 'The plane was checked, no bomb was found and all passengers were sent for another security search,' said 
Nexta, a Belarus opposition channel on the Telegram messaging app, which Protasevich previously edited. 
Global outrage as Belarus diverts flight, arrests opposition activist
 Lukashenko's press service said on its own Telegram channel the president had given the order to divert the flight 
and had ordered a MiG-29 fighter jet to accompany the plane. 
 It comes as Belarus authorities intensify their crackdown on the opposition following historic protests that gripped 
the ex-Soviet country after last year's disputed presidential election. 
- 'Absolutely unacceptable' - 
The United States 'strongly condemned' the arrest, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling for Protasevich's 
release. 
 'This shocking act perpetrated by the Lukashenka regime endangered the lives of more than 120 passengers, 
including US citizens,' he said in a statement, using an alternative spelling of the Belarusian leader's name. 
 He added on Twitter: 'We demand an international investigation and are coordinating with our partners on next 
steps.' 
 European leaders reacted with fury. In Athens, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted: 'The forced landing of a 
commercial plane to detain a journalist is an unprecedented, shocking act.' 
 Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda described Belarus's actions as 'abhorrent' and prosecutors said they had 
opened a criminal investigation for the hijacking of a plane. 
 The government in Ireland, where Ryanair is headquartered, described the incident as 'absolutely unacceptable', 
while NATO called it 'dangerous' and demanded an international investigation. 
 Since last August's disputed election, Belarusians have taken to the streets demanding the resignation of 
Lukashenko, who has ruled for over two decades. 
 Protasevich and Nexta founder Stepan Putilo, 22, were added to Belarus's list of 'individuals involved in terrorist 
activity' last year. 
 The two — both now based in Poland — were accused of causing mass unrest, an offence punishable by up to 15 
years in jail. 
 Belarus also labelled the Nexta Telegram channels and its logo 'extremist' and ordered them blocked. 
 With close to two million subscribers on Telegram, Nexta Live and its sister channel Nexta are prominent 
opposition channels and helped mobilise protesters. 
 'It is absolutely obvious that this is an operation of secret services to capture the plane in order to detain activist 
and blogger Roman Protasevich,' exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said on Telegram. 
 The opposition says that Tikhanovskaya, who fled to neighbouring Lithuania after the election, was the true winner 
of last year's presidential vote. 
- KGB involved? - 
A member of the Nexta team, Tadeusz Giczan, tweeted that representatives of the Belarusian security agency had 
been on Protasevich's flight. 
 'Then when the plane had entered Belarus airspace, the KGB officers initiated a fight with the Ryanair crew 
insisting there's an IED onboard,' he said. 
 A spokeswoman for state company Lithuanian Airports, Lina Beisine, told AFP that Minsk airport had said the flight 
was redirected 'due to a conflict between a member of the crew and the passengers'. 
 In a statement — that did not mention Protasevich — Ryanair said the flight's crew had been notified by Belarus air 
traffic control of 'a potential security threat on board' and were instructed to divert to Minsk, the 'nearest' airport. 
 The EU and the United States have sanctioned Lukashenko and dozens of officials and businessmen tied to his 
regime with asset freezes and visa bans.

Samoa's constitutional crisis deepens, and the world this week.

 Outrage After Belarus Grounds Flight 
Outraged U.S. and EU leaders are considering sanctions[2] against Belarus after the country scrambled a fighter jet 
to forcibly divert a Ryanair flight headed to Lithuania—forcing it to land instead in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, in 
order to arrest a dissident. The decision to ground the Vilnius-bound flight was reportedly made directly by 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, using the pretext of a bomb threat on board. Ryanair's CEO told Irish 
media that Belarusian intelligence agents were reportedly on board. 
 The aircraft stayed on the Minsk tarmac for roughly 7 hours before making its way to Vilnius, finally completing its 
journey from Athens. The plane left without[3] Roman Protasevich, the co-founder and former editor of NEXTA, a 
popular media outlet for Belarus's embattled opposition. According to a post later deleted by the Belarusian interior 
ministry, Protasevich was arrested at Minsk airport; his girlfriend, a Russian citizen, was also forced off the plane. 
 Protasevich was put on a terrorist watchlist by Minsk authorities last year[4] on suspicion of starting riots and 
inciting hatred, charges that could lead to 12 to 15 years in prison. 
 Air piracy. EU leaders used the terms 'air piracy' and 'state hijacking[5]' to describe the incident. The leaders of 
Lithuania and Poland, where Protasevich was living in exile, have been vocal in calling for action. Lithuanian 
President Gitanas Nauseda called for fresh sanctions on Belarus at a meeting of EU leaders on Monday, while 
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki called[6] Belarus's action an 'unprecedented act of state terrorism.' 
Belarus 'State Hijacking' Prompts Talk of More Sanctions
 European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has promised[7] 'consequences' for 'outrageous and illegal 
behavior' and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the incident 'shocking' and said that the United States 
is working with its partners on further actions. 
 More sanctions? It's not yet clear what steps these leaders can take. Lukashenko and many of his domestic allies 
are already under EU and U.S. sanctions over his government's repressive tactics. The EU added Lukashenko to 
its sanctions list in November following a brutal crackdown[8] by state authorities after the Aug. 9 presidential 
election, a vote considered fraudulent by international election monitors. 
 'No fly' zone. One immediate action Western leaders could take would be to ban all air traffic[9] over Belarus, a 
move suggested by the leaders of eight countries' foreign affairs committees, including U.S. Senator Bob 
Menendez, in a joint letter issued on Sunday. The leaders condemned Belarus's actions as 'an act of piracy,' called 
for Belarus's suspension from international bodies such as Interpol, and for fresh elections. 
 The World This Week 
On Monday, May 24, a two-day summit[10] of the European Council takes place in Brussels on the subject of the 
bloc's response to COVID-19, climate change, and Russia. 
 Guillermo Lasso is inaugurated as president of Ecuador following his surprise victory in April's election. 
 On Wednesday, May 26, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken travels[11] to Israel and the West Bank as well as 
Egypt and Jordan as part of peace efforts following the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas last week. 
 On Thursday, May 27, French President Emmanuel Macron visits Rwanda as the two countries seek to improve 
relations following the publication of reports detailing France's role during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. 
 On Sunday, May 30, Cyprus holds parliamentary elections. 
 What We're Following Today 
Israel's government. A potential coalition deal to oust Benjamin Netanyahu as Israeli prime minister is back on[12], 
Israeli media reported on Sunday, as Naftali Bennett, the leader of the right-wing Yamina party, appears to have 
resumed talks with the centrist Yesh Atid party. If a deal is struck, Bennett will reportedly be first in line for prime 
minister in a rotation arrangement. Bennett had previously withdrawn from negotiations with Yesh Atid during 
Israel's 11-day conflict with Hamas. A cease-fire, now in its fifth day, still holds. 
 Samoa in crisis. The inauguration of Samoa's first female prime minister has been thrown into turmoil. Fiame 
Naomi Mata'afa won a slim majority in Samoa's parliament after an independent lawmaker backed her party, 
breaking a 25-25 seat split following April elections. However, the incumbent, Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, has 
abruptly canceled the parliamentary session in which Mata'afa was slated to be sworn in and has publicly 
refused[13] to step down. 
 Mata'afa denounced the move as a coup and called[14] it 'an illegal takeover of government.' New Zealand Prime 
Minister Jacinda Ardern has called for Samoa to 'uphold the rule of law,' a sentiment echoed by Australian Foreign 
Minister Marise Payne. 
 Italy's tragedy. Fourteen people died in Italy on Sunday after a cable car[15] in which they were traveling fell to the 
ground. Although the exact cause of the tragedy is not yet known, authorities have so far blamed the collapse on a 
broken cable. Transport Minister Enrico Giovannini immediately announced a commission to investigate the 
incident and plans to visit the site today. The incident is the most deadly to occur on Italian infrastructure since a 
bridge collapsed in 2018, killing 43 people. 
 Keep an Eye On 
Turkey's drones. Poland become the first NATO member to purchase Turkish drones[16], Defense Minister Mariusz 
Blaszczak said on Saturday. The contract for 24 armed Bayraktar TB2 drones is due to be signed by Polish 
President Andrzej Duda when he travels to Turkey next week. The sale underlines Turkey's status as the world's 
fourth largest drone producer and comes after its unmanned aircraft were seen as crucial in securing victory for 
Azerbaijan in its war with Armenia last year. 
Belarus 'State Hijacking' Prompts Talk of More Sanctions
 Peru's election. Peru's socialist candidate Pedro Castillo has opened up a wide lead[17] in polling ahead of the 
country's presidential election on June 6. Castillo garnered the support of 44.8 of supporters in a recent poll, more 
than 10 points ahead of his challenger, the conservative Keiko Fujimori. Castillo's campaign appears to have 
recovered from a dip in support earlier in the month, which showed he and Fujimori at almost even[18] support. 
 Odds and Ends 
Free beer[19], donuts[20], and even marijuana[21] has been used to entice people to get a COVID-19 vaccine 
across America. In rural Thailand, residents have been offered a beefier alternative. The Mae Chem district in 
Thailand's northern province of Chiang Mai has offered vaccinated villagers the chance to win a live cow (worth 
roughly $320 dollars) every week until the end of the year in a bid to increase vaccinations. 
 The program is already seeing some success. 'Our vaccineregistrationnumbers have gone from hundreds to 
thousands in a couple of days,' district chief Boonlue Thamtharanuraktold Reuters[22]. 'The villagers love cows. 
Cows can be sold for cash.' 
 Officials are scrambling to register residents ahead of a mass vaccination campaign beginning on June 7. So far, 
2.1 percent[23] of Thailand's population has received a vaccine dose.

 Belarus 'Hijacks' Ryanair Flight to Arrest Lukashenko Critic 
A youth, pillion riding on a motorbike, was killed as his friend riding the bike tried to evade a forest checkpost during 
the ongoing lockdown in Telangana's Mancherial district. 
 The youth riding the bike at a high speed dodged in time to escape the iron bar, but the pillion rider's head 
smashed against the bar. He fell off the vehicle and his death was instantaneous. 
The youth riding the bike did not stop or came back to see his friend. The incident occurred on May 22 but came to 
light on Monday with a video going viral on the social media. 
 According to police, the incident occurred at forest department checkpost on the main road at Tapalpur village in 
Jannaram mandal. 
 The video shows a forest guard standing at the checkpost with the gate lowered signaling the approaching bike to 
stop. However, fearing that his bike may be seized for violatinglockdown[1], the bike rider did not stop and 
approached the checkpost at a high speed. 
 While the rider bunked on approaching the gate to avoid hitting the pole, the pillion rider rammed into the pole and 
fell off the vehicle, though the guard was seen trying to raise the gate at the last minute. 
 [embedded content] 
 The youth riding the vehicle did not bother to stop to check on his friend. He sped away as the forest personnel 
deployed there were stunned. 
 The deceased was identified as Venkatesh Goud, 30, a resident of Kotha Kommugudem in Luxettipet mandal of 
the same district. His friend Bandi Chandrashekhar was riding the bike. 
 Jannaram Sub-Inspector of Police Madhusudhan Rao said the police registered a case on a complaint by 
deceased's father Malla Goud and took up investigation[2]. Police were on the lookout for Chandrashekhar, who 
was absconding.

 European Union Foreign Policy Representative Josep Borrell on Monday condemned the incident occurred on 
Sunday involving a Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) aircraft in Belarus, as the Irish airline's Chief Executive Michael 
O'Leary called it an "act of aviation piracy," London's Financial Times reported Monday.
EU diplomats were quoted saying the bloc is considering sanctions against Belarus including prohibiting the 
Belarusian flagship carrier from entering EU airports as well as declaring the country's airspace unsafe. 
Borrell said an "international investigation" will be started, calling the act "yet another blatant attempt by the 
Belarusian authorities to silence all opposition voices," after the airplane was diverted and forced to land in Minsk, 
before Belarusian authorities arrested a dissident journalist who was onboard.
Belarus deemed such accusations as "baseless," while Russia responded by saying the EU reaction to the incident 
was "shocking," the report added.
Shares in Ryanair were marginally lower on Monday afternoon.

May 24, 2021( EU Reporter: http://www.eureporter.co Delivered by Newstex)  
 In one of the most strongly worded denunciations of Belarus's forced landing of the Ryanair Flight travelling from 
Athens to Vilnius, European Council President Charles Michel has issued a communique stating: 'The incident will 
not remain without consequences.' 
The statement comes ahead of today's Special European Council of heads of state and government. The statement 
condemned Belarus's actions in the 'strongest possible terms' and called for the immediate release of NEXTA 
journalist Raman Pratasevich. Leaders will be discussing their response to this 'unprecedented incident' at the 
meeting. 
The US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken described Belarussia's actions as 'brazen and shocking' 
 We strongly condemn the Lukashenka regime's brazen and shocking act to divert a commercial flight and arrest a 
journalist. We demand an international investigation and are coordinating with our partners on next steps. The 
United States stands with the people of Belarus. — Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken) May 23, 2021[1] 
As German foreign minister Heiko Maas points out, the fact that this was an Irish airline operating a flight between 
two EU member state, makes yesterday's action particularly without precedent.

 The prosecutor general of Poland has launched an investigation into the forced landing of a Ryanair Holdings' 
(RYAAY) 
plane in Minsk, Belarus, Reuters reported.
"The prosecutor general has ordered an investigation into the landing of a Ryanair plane in Minsk. Most probably 
the investigation will also involve a number of steps at the international level," a spokesman in Poland's 
prosecutor's office told Reuters.
Because the plane was registered in Poland, the case comes under Polish jurisdiction, deputy foreign minister 
Pawel Jablonski said.
Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the plane, en route to Lithuania from Athens, was diverted to Minsk by a 
MiG-29 fighter jet on the pretext of a bomb threat and was forced to make an emergency landing, at which point 
Belarusian opposition activist Roman Protasevich was arrested.
"This act bears resemblance to an act of state terrorism," said the ministry in a statement.

May 24, 2021( The Week UK: http://www.theweek.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  
 The EU and Washington have condemned Belarus for forcing a plane bound for Lithuania to make an emergency 
landing inMinsk in order to arrest an exiled opposition journalist on board. 
The Ryanair flight from Athensto Vilnius was in Belarusianairspace when the country's authorities scrambled a 
fighter jet to divert thepassenger plane to Belarus' capital on Sunday afternoon. 
The drastic move and subsequent arrestshowjust how President Alexander Lukashenko 'is prepared to go to 
suppress opposition after disputed elections last year', says the BBC[1]'s James Landale. 'The EU now has to 
decide what price it is prepared to make him pay.' What happened? Ryanair said its crew had been 'notified by 
Belarus (Air Traffic Control) of a potential security threat on board and were instructed to divert to the nearest 
airport, Minsk'. The airport said there had been rumours of a bomb on board, but 'no bomb was found when the 
plane was searched',The Telegraph[2] reports. 
But 'Belarusian officials took the opportunity' to arrest Belarusian journalist and activist Roman Protasevich, says 
the newspaper.The Guardian[3]reports that his Russian-born girlfriend Sofia Sapega, who is studying at auniversity 
in Lithuania, was travelling with him on the flight from Greece and was also detained. 
According to fellow passengers, Protasevichwas trembling and 'super-scared' before being led away by police. 'I'm 
facing the death penalty here,' he reportedly told other passengers. 
State media in Belarus saidthe order for the diversion and arrest was issued by Lukashenko, who has cracked 
down on dissenting voices since winning a disputed election last August[4]. 
Protasevich is accused of organising mass riots and of inciting social hatred -allegations that he denies.The mass 
unrest charges against him carry a sentence of up to 15 years. Who is Roman Protasevich? Now aged 26, 
Protasevich first attracted the attention of the Belarusian authorities as a teenager, when he was expelled from 
school after taking part in a protest. 
He went on to become aneditor for Poland-based online news service Nexta, which used the Telegram messenger 
app to circulate footage of protests againstLukashenko last year. 
Nexta was subsequently designated an extremist organisation and banned from Belarus by the authorities in Minsk. 
Lukashenko's government has also called for the extradition of Protasevich, who left Belarus in 2019 to live in exile 
in Lithuania. 
He now works for another Telegram channel, Belamova, after stepping in to take over fromblogger Igor Losik, 
whowas arrested by the Belarusian authorities in June last year What next? Protasevich's arrest has triggered 
a'global outcry', says The Guardian,with the EU's executive describing the plane diversion as a 'hijacking'. The US 
Ryanair plane 'hijack': what's happening in Belarus?
State Department has also condemned the'shocking act', with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying 
thatPresident Joe Biden's administration was 'coordinating with our partners on next steps'. 
Europeanleaders are meeting today to discuss what action might be taken against Belarus, after European 
Commission headUrsula von der Leyen warned that 'the outrageous and illegal behaviour... will have 
consequences'. 
Bloc leaders are facing growing callsfrom countries including Poland to impose sanctions. Lithuania's 
PresidentGitanas Nauseda has arguedthat such measures 'could make a larger impact on the behaviour of the 
Belarusian regime'. 
The head of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Menendez, has also called for a ban on flights over 
Belarus. 
And some officials have suggested that 'cars and lorries could be stopped from entering the EU from Belarus', the 
BBC reports.

 Belarus 'Hijacks' Ryanair Flight to Arrest Lukashenko Critic 
US top infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said he is "not convinced" Covid-19 developed naturally, and has 
called for an open investigation into China to unravel the virus' origins, the media reported. 
 Fauci was asked during a Poynter event, "United Facts of America: A Festival of Fact-Checking", earlier this 
month, about whether he was confident that Covid developed naturally. 
 Dr Anthony FauciReuters 
 "No actually. I am not convinced about that, I think we should continue to investigate what went on in China until 
we continue to find out to the best of our ability what happened," Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergies 
and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) was quoted as saying, Fox News reported on Sunday. 
 "Certainly, the people who investigated it say it likely was the emergence from an animal reservoir that then 
infected individuals, but it could have been something else, and we need to find that out. So, you know, that's the 
reason why I said I'm perfectly in favor of any investigation that looks into the origin of the virus," Fauci added. 
 The Coronavirus was first reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. Reports have claimed of 
the virus' origin from a lab there. Further, Fauci called for an investigation into China during a Senate hearing last 
week, the New York Post reported. 
 "Do you think it's possible that Covid-19 arose from a lab accident a in Wuhan, and should it be fully investigated?" 
Senator Roger Marshall (R-Kansas), a doctor, asked Fauci during a Senate hearing on May 11. "That possibility 
certainly exists, and I am totally in favour of a full investigation of whether that could have happened," Fauci replied. 
 Another Senator had claimed that funding through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) had been funneled to the 
controversial Wuhan Institute of Virology -- the Chinese lab that is believed to have played a role in the initial 
outbreak of Covid-19, the Fox News reported. 
 Rand Paul specifically zeroed in on gain of function research -- which works on making pathogens deadlier or more 
easily transmissible. He alleged that a US virologist had been working with the Chinese institute on such research 
and said it was funded by the NIH. 
In favour of further probe 
Anthony Fauci says he is 'not convinced' Covid-19 developed naturally, favours further probe
"I do not have any accounting of what the Chinese may have done, and I'm fully in favour of any further 
investigation of what went on in China,[1]" Fauci said. "However, I will repeat again, the NIH and NIAID 
categorically have not funded the gain of function research to be conducted in the Wuhan Institute of Virology," he 
added 
 Fauci, who is also a top adviser to President Biden on the coronavirus pandemic,[2]had in the initial months of the 
pandemic last year dismissed the theory that Covid originated from China. He stated that the virus most likely 
"evolved in nature and then jumped species", as opposed to being "artificially or deliberately manipulated". 
 While the Trump administration officials have long argued there is a high chance Covid-19 was the result of a lab 
leak, the World Health Organization declared, last week, that the lab leak theory "extremely unlikely". 
 However, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the research team's assessment on whether the virus 
entered the human population following a laboratory incident was not "extensive enough" and requires further 
investigation. 
 White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, this week, the Biden administration has conveyed both publicly and 
privately that the Chinese government was "not transparent from the beginning", the report said.

May 24, 2021( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich, who was detained in Belarus after the Ryanair flight he was on was 
diverted and forced to land on Sunday, began his digital activism in his teens. 
 A student at the time, he was arrested in 2012 aged just 17 for running two groups on the Russian-based social 
networking site Vkontakte against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. 
 One of them was called 'We are sick of this Lukashenko' — the former collective farm manager who has ruled 
Belarus with an iron fist since 1994, a year before Protasevich was born. 
 'They hit me in the kidneys and liver,' Protasevich said at the time. 
 'I urinated blood for three days afterwards. They threatened to accuse me of unsolved murders.' 
 During the interrogation, he said, officers from Belarus's security service, still named the KGB as in Soviet times, 
were demanding his passwords to the online groups. 
 He later worked as a photographer for Belarusian media and was the recipient of a Vaclav Havel Journalism 
Fellowship in 2017-2018 — an award for aspiring independent journalists named after the late Czech dissident 
turned president. 
 Protasevich left Belarus in 2019 after he started working for the highly influential pro-opposition Telegram channel 
Nexta ('Somebody' in Belarusian). 
 He later became editor-in-chief at the channel, which currently has more than 1.2 million subscribers. 
 The channel had a role in organising the anti-Lukashenko protests by sharing with its followers details on meeting 
times and dates. 
- 'First terrorist journalist' - 
Living between Poland and Lithuania, both hubs for Belarusian exiles, he has since become the editor of the 
channel BGM -- an acronym in Russian meaning 'Smart Belarus' — which has 260,000 subscribers. 
 The 26-year-old's girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, who was detained with him, is a law student at the European 
Humanities University (EHU) in Vilnius. 
 Protasevich covered the 2020 presidential election campaign in which opposition challenger Svetlana 
Tikhanovskaya took on Lukashenko. 
Roman Protasevich: From teen activist to regime bugbear
 Unprecedented mass protests broke out after Lukashenko declared victory once again and the authorities 
responded with violence. 
 Belarus issued a warrant for Protasevich's arrest in November over his work for Nexta, declaring that he was 
'involved in terrorist activity'. 
 On his Twitter profile, he mockingly describes himself as 'history's first terrorist journalist'. 
 Terror offences can carry the death penalty in Belarus, which still carries out capital punishment. 
 After the plane was diverted and coming in to land in Minsk on Sunday, passengers overheard him saying that 'he 
was facing the death penalty'. 
 His latest tweet on May 16 was about photographing Tikhanovskaya's visit to Athens — the city where the Ryanair 
flight left from on its way to Vilnius. 
 The post Roman Protasevich: From teen activist to regime bugbear[1] appeared first on Digital Journal[2].

 The European Council adopted a series of conclusions[1] Monday that "strongly condemned" Belarus' diversion of 
a commercial plane and subsequent arrest of an opposition leader and outlined a series of next steps. 
State of play: Among their conclusions, the Council called for the immediate release of Raman Pratasevich and 
Sofia Sapega, and for an independent investigation into the episode. It also called for the submission of sanctions 
proposals and advised EU-based airlines not to fly over Belarus.  
The big picture: A Ryanair flight en route from Greece to Lithuania was forced by Belarusian air control to land[2] in 
Belarus' capital Minsk Sunday, under the pretext of a "a potential security risk on board." Belarusian authorities then 
detained Pratasevich, a journalist and activist who was critical in organizing mass anti-government protests in 
Belarus last year.Belarus' actions have been described a "hijacking" by some European leaders, who have vowed 
the country will face consequences.The European Humanities University in Lithuania released a statement[3] 
Monday confirming that one of its students, Sofia Sapega, had also been on the flight and detained in Minsk. What 
they're saying: "The European Council strongly condemns the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk, Belarus, 
on 23 May 2021 endangering aviation safety, and the detention by Belarusian authorities of journalist Raman 
Pratasevich and Sofia Sapega," said the Council in its statement. 
Of note: On Monday a video[4] circulated online in which Pratasevich says that he is "in good health and 
acknowledges having played a role in organizing mass disturbances in Minsk last year," Reuters[5] reports. He 
adds that he is in a pre-trail detention facility in Minsk and "denies having heart problems reported by some social 
media," per Reuters. Pratasevich's supporters have claimed that the video was made under duress. "The regime's 
propaganda channels posted a video of arrested Raman Pratasevich, saying that he is treated lawfully in the Minsk 
Detention Center №1. This is how Raman looks under physical and moral pressure. I demand the immediate 
release of Raman and all political prisoners," exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya tweeted[6].

 Belarus 'Hijacks' Ryanair Flight to Arrest Lukashenko Critic 
The Supreme Court on Monday said its main concern is that benefits which are meant for migrant workers must 
reach them and stressed the process of their registration is woefully slow. The top court said the Centre and state 
governments must expedite registration of migrant workers and also those working in the unorganised sectors. 
 A bench comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan and M. R. Shah told the Centre's counsel: "Our main concern is that 
benefits meant for migrant workers must reach them. We have taken a cursory look at your (Centre) affidavit but 
there is nothing about registration of migrant workers in it." The top court also queried that how will the government 
give dry ration to labourers who do not have ration cards? 
 twitter/ANI 
 The top court also queried, why there is no national data on workers of unorganised sector? The court emphasised 
that data and the portal are essential to ensure benefits reach the needy during the lockdown. 
 Solicitor General Tushar Mehta agreed with the top court's suggestion that identification and registration of migrant 
workers is necessary, which would help in transfer of money directly in their accounts, besides other benefits. The 
top court also queried the Centre, who will monitor government schemes are reaching the beneficiaries, there 
should be supervision these benefits are reaching the needy, and suggested appointed of nodal officers. 
 Justice Shah said: "On paper, we have government has spent thousands of crores, but the concern is that whether 
it is reaching the needy persons?" 
 The bench said: "The government must approach them (migrant workers) to get them registered." The bench 
added governments could extend benefits to migrant workers, those who lost employment amid the pandemic, only 
if they were registered. The bench emphasised, "It is a difficult task, but has to be achieved." The bench added that 
the Centre and states must expedite registration of migrant workers along with those working in the unorganised 
sectors. 
Advocate Prashant Bhushan pointed out that migrant workers aren't only construction workers but rickshaw pullers, 
small vendors and street hawkers, who have been severely affected due to the pandemic. Bhushan submitted that 
cash transfer is a must to provide succour to them. 
Expedite registration of migrant workers to provide them benefits: SC asks Centre and states
Slow pace of registration 
The bench agreed with Bhushan that process of registering migrant workers is very slow. Justice Bhushan stressed 
on registration of all unorganised workers so that they can avail benefits of schemes. However, the bench made it 
clear it would not order cash transfers which is a policy decision. 
 The top court noted that the earlier lockdown[1]and the ongoing lockdown may be different, but mentality of the 
migrant workers will be the same, psychologically they would want to go their home, and this cannot be said that 
they do not require any help. 
 The top court also queried the Gujarat government, how illiterate workers will register on the government portal, 
and suggested the government should reach out to them. The bench told the Gujarat government counsel to 
consider cancelling licences of contractors and employers who drag their feet on registering migrant workers. The 
bench emphasised that all registration of migrant workers should come on a national database, and it should not be 
localised. 
 The top court said it will pass orders by 4 pm today. 
 The top court made these observations during the hearing of an application by activists Harsh Mander, Anjali 
Bhardwaj and Jagdeep Chhokar, who filed an urgent application through advocate Prashant Bhushan seeking 
directions to ensure thatmigrant workers[2]are not deprived of ration and food security, and they should also be able 
to travel back to their homes at nominal cost. 
 The application was filed in the suo motu case initiated by the top court last year to address migrant labourer crisis 
during the national lockdown.

 Pressure was building Monday for a tough international response to Belarus's forced landing of a European airliner 
so it could arrest an opposition activist. 
 The Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius carrying dissident journalist Roman Protasevichwas diverted while in 
Belarusian airspace on Sunday over a supposed bomb threat. 
 Accompanied by a Belarusian fighter jet on the orders of strongman Alexander Lukashenko, the plane landed in 
the capital Minsk where Protasevich, a 26-year-old who had been living in Lithuania, was arrested along with his 
Russian girlfriend. 
 The unprecedented move sparked an international outcry, with Western leaders accusing Belarusian authorities of 
essentially hijacking a European plane. 
 As EU leaders prepared to meet for a summit later on Monday, Brussels said it had summonedthe Belarusian 
ambassador to condemn the 'coercive act'. 
 Belarus's exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said Protasevich's life was in danger, calling for an 
international investigation and concrete steps against the regime. 
 'The time for statements has passed — obviously Belarusians expect decisive actions and assistance from the 
international community,' she said in a video statement. 
 The EU and other Western countries have imposed a wide range of sanctions on Lukashenko's government over a 
brutal crackdown on opposition demonstrations that followed his disputed re-election to a sixth term last August. 
 Together with co-founder Stepan Putilo, Protasevich until recently ran the Nexta telegram channel that galvanised 
and directed the protests, which were the biggest challenge to Lukashenko's rule since he took power in the ex-
Soviet country in 1994. 
- 'Act of state terrorism' - 
Belarus on Monday insisted the country had acted legally and accused the West of playing politics. 
 'There is no doubt that the actions of our competent authorities fully met established international rules,' foreign 
ministry spokesman Anatoly Glaz said in a statement, accusing the West of 'politicising' the situation. 
 'Unfounded accusations are being made,' he said. 
Pressure mounts for action over Belarus forced landing
 The diversion of the plane was roundly condemned in Europe, with EU chief Ursula von der Leyen describing it as 
'outrageous and illegal', Poland denouncing it as 'an act of state terrorism' and France calling for a 'strong and 
united response'. 
 NATO demanded a probe into the 'serious and dangerous incident' and alliance envoys were to discuss it on 
Tuesday. 
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called it 'a shocking act' that 'endangered the lives of more than 120 
passengers, including US citizens.' 
 Belarus's main ally Russia showed little concern, however. 
 Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Minsk was taking an 'absolutely reasonable approach' while ministry 
spokeswoman Maria Zakharova mocked the Western indignation. 
 'We are shocked that the West calls the incident in Belarusian air space 'shocking,'' Zakharova said on Facebook, 
accusing Western nations of 'kidnappings, forced landings and illegal arrests'. 
 The International Civil Aviation Organization — the UN's civil aviation agency — said the forced landing could be in 
contravention of the Chicago Convention, which protects nations' airspace sovereignty. 
- Calls to ban overflights - 
Some in Europe were already taking steps, with Lithuania saying it would not authorise any flights that cross 
Belarusian territory and Latvia-based regional airline airBaltic saying it would now be avoiding the country's 
airspace. 
 EU leaders will debate tougher sanctions against Belarus on Monday, with Lithuania and France calling for 
Belarusian airspace to be blocked and aircraft from the country stopped from landing in EU airports. 
 The bloc was already working on a newround of measures that was expected to see dozens more officials added 
to an asset freeze and visa ban blacklist in the coming weeks. 
 Those sanctions could now be expedited and Brussels is expected to propose more measures in response to the 
forced landing, an EU source said. 
 'We are assessing the situation and do not rule out any action,' the source said. 
 - With close to two million subscribers on Telegram, Nexta Live and its sister channel Nexta are prominent 
opposition channels and helped mobilise protesters in Belarus. 
 - 'KGB on board' - 
Protasevich and Putilo were added to Belarus's list of 'individuals involved in terrorist activity' last year. 
 The two were accused of causing mass unrest, an offence punishable by up to 15 years in jail. 
 A member of the Nexta team, Tadeusz Giczan, tweeted that representatives of the Belarusian security agency had 
been on Protasevich's flight. 
 'Then when the plane had entered Belarus airspace, the KGB officers initiated a fight with the Ryanair crew 
insisting there's an IED (improvised explosive device) onboard,' he said. 
 Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said it appeared that agents of the Belarusian KGB were on the plane and 
also deboarded in Minsk. 
 'I think it's the first time it's happened to a European airline,' O'Leary told Ireland's Newstalk radio. 'It was a state-
sponsored hijacking, it was state-sponsored piracy.'

 The EU urged a probe after a Ryanair passenger jet was forced to land in Minsk — in an apparent bid to arrest an 
activist blogger on board. EU leaders are set to discuss additional sanctions against Belarus.Top EU diplomat 
Josep Borrell on Monday called for an international investigation after Belarus forced a Ryanair passenger jet to 
land in Minsk, in an apparent effort to arrest an activist journalist. 
"In carrying out this coercive act, the Belarusian authorities have jeopardized the safety of passengers and crew," 
Borrell said in a statement issued on Monday. 
"An international investigation into this incident must be carried out to ascertain any breach of international aviation 
rules," the statement went on. 
The Belarusian Transport Ministry on Monday announced it had set up a commission to carry out its own 
investigation into the forced landing and would publish the results soon, according to a report by the Russian RIA 
news agency. 
EU to discuss incident at summit 
The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, said EU leaders will discuss the incident at an EU summit 
beginning on Monday, adding that the affair would not remain "without consequences." 
He called on the Belarusian authorities to immediately release the detained passenger. 
An EU spokesman said the leaders would discuss "possible sanctions" on Belarus. High-level officials in the 
country have already been sanctioned by the bloc over the brutal repression of the opposition, protesters and 
journalists following disputed elections in August 2020. More than 34,000 people have been arrested in the country 
since August, and thousands have been brutally mistreated. 
DW's Bernd Riegert, who is following the summit, said that "the most likely sanctions are targeted sanctions, or 
smart sanctions, as they call it here in Brussels." These include asset freezes and restrictions on travel for 
sanctioned individuals, he said, along with cutting Belarus off from the SWIFT banking system internationally. 
"All EU leaders are on the same page, even the direct neighboring countries like Poland and the Baltics. It seems 
as though Belarus has crossed a red line," he said.  
What happened? 
On Sunday, a Ryanair jet flying from Athens to Lithuania was intercepted by a Belarusian fighter jet and diverted to 
Minsk International Airport after being told a bomb was on board. 
Belarus : EU calls for international probe into forced landing of Ryanair plane
No explosives were found on the aircraft, but Raman Pratasevich, a 26-year-old former editor from the Minsk-critical 
Telegram channel Nexta, was allegedly taken into custody. Pratasevich is a known critic of Belarus' long-time 
leader Alexander Lukashenko and his government. 
After hours of delays, the plane was later allowed to fly on to Lithuania — but at least four people, including 
Pratasevich's Russian girlfriend, did not reboard the plane. 
In an interview with DW, an adviser to opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Franak Viacorka, said 
Pratasevich was now "in the hands of the cruelest regime in Europe" and voiced concern for his safety. 
What does Ryanair say? 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told Irish radio station Newstalk that the forced landing "was a case of state-
sponsored hijacking ... state-sponsored piracy" carried out to detain a dissident journalist. 
O'Leary said his company believed that some Belarusian secret service agents had been on the plane as well. 
Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney echoed O'Leary's remarks, calling the incident "aviation piracy, state-
sponsored." 
He told state broadcaster RTE that sanctions on Belarus with a "real edge" were needed in response.  
The low-cost airline Ryanair is headquartered in the Irish capital, Dublin.

Belarus 'Hijacking' Opens New Playbook for Autocrats

 May 24, 2021, 6:11 PM  
 Nine months after his native Belarus erupted in protests over rigged presidential elections, 26-year-old Roman 
Protasevich had just taken a vacation in Greece with his girlfriend. Protasevich is the founder and former editor of 
the Nexta channel on the encrypted messaging app Telegram, which played a decisive role in coordinating protests 
last fall that drew hundreds of thousands of people out into the streets. 
 Having lived in exile in Lithuania since 2019, like many Belarusian journalists, he was used to being harassed by 
the country's formidable security services. On Sunday morning, as he prepared to board a flight from Athens to 
Vilnius, he texted colleagues[1] that he was being tailed by a suspicious looking man who attempted to take 
pictures of his passport as he boarded the plane. 
 'We receive death threats at least a dozen times a day so we're pretty much used to it,' said Tadeusz Giczan, the 
editor in chief of Nexta. 
 As the flight made its way north through Belarusian airspace, authorities in the country appear to have called in a 
bogus bomb threat and scrambled a fighter jet to divert the Ryanair flight to the capital of Belarus, Minsk. It was a 
brazen attack of air piracy to arrest Protasevich, who was added to the country's terrorist watchlist last year 
because of his opposition activities, and who could now face the death penalty if he is convicted of crimes of 
terrorism. 
 'We didn't think something like this could actually happen. Turns out we were wrong,' Giczan said. 
 The brazen decision to snatch a journalist out of the sky was swiftly condemned by U.S. and European officials as 
a 'hijacking'[2] and an act of air piracy that shattered international norms. Many now fear that, absent a robust 
response, it could set a terrifying precedent for rogue states to waylay airliners in pursuit of their opponents. 
 Others see it as a key test case for whether the European Union can stand up for the security of its own citizens. 
'[W]hat happened yesterday is even more serious than what you describe,' Nathalie Loiseau, a member of 
European Parliament and former French minister for European affairs, tweeted[3] to President of the European 
Council Charles Michel. 'It's a litmus test for EU's ability to be respected. Please make sure EU leaders don't fail the 
test this time,' she added. 
 The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Robert Menendez, issued a joint statement 
with senior European lawmakers calling for immediate reprisals, including new sanctions on Belarusian President 
Belarus 'Hijacking' Opens New Playbook for Autocrats
Aleksandr Lukashenko's regime, banning Belarus from the International Civil Aviation Organization, and a 'ban on 
all overflight of Belarus including flights to and from the country.' 
 'This act of state terror and kidnapping is a threat to all those who travel in Europe and beyond,' Menendez wrote in 
the joint statement with his counterparts from the Czech Republic, Latvia, Germany, Lithuania, Ireland, Poland, and 
the United Kingdom. 
 European carriers including Wizz Air, AirBaltic, Scandinavian Airlines, and others announced on Monday that they 
would reroute flights to avoid Belarusian airspace; Britain's transport secretary ordered British airlines to do the 
same. In a sign that the fallout for Lukashenko will go beyond the EU's borders, Ukrainian President Volodymyr 
Zelensky also ordered a halt on direct Ukrainian flights to and from Belarus. 
 On Monday, pro-government outlets released what appeared to be a highly scripted video of Protasevich in which 
he confessed to planning mass unrest in Minsk and claimed that he had not been mistreated by police. 
Protasevich's family and colleagues fear he will be tortured in prison. 
 A wave of unprecedented mass street protests that broke out across the country in response to rigged elections 
last August were met with blistering violence from the police and security services. Some 35,000 people have since 
been arrested as reports of systematic beatings and torture have emerged from the country's prisons. Almost 400 
political prisoners are currently behind bars. 
 Journalists and opposition activists left Belarus in droves. Like Protasevich, many settled in the capital of 
neighboring Lithuania as well as in Kyiv, Ukraine, and Warsaw, Poland, which now feel uncomfortably close to 
Belarus's borders. 
 'No one can feel safe,' said Franak Viacorka, foreign affairs spokesperson for Belarusian opposition leader 
Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who is also now based in Vilnius. Viacorka said that Tikhanovskaya, whose security is 
provided by the Lithuanian government, had been warned that Belarus may try and ground flights to nab her, but 
that it had been considered a distant possibility. 'No one believed that airspace could be the place of this political 
war,' he said. 
 The audacious decision to ground a civilian airliner in pursuit of a dissident may be unprecedented, but Belarus's 
extraterritorial pursuit of its opponents is not. A report published[4] by Freedom House earlier this year documented 
608 instances of people being physically targeted by authoritarian states overseas since 2014, including 
assassinations, abductions, assaults, detentions, and unlawful deportations. 
 In August 2020, Rwandan officials abducted Paul Rusesabagina, who was the inspiration for the film Hotel 
Rwanda, in Dubai. A strident critic of the country's president, he was taken back to Rwanda, where he was arrested 
and charged with terrorism in a move decried by international human rights organizations. 
 Fifty-eight percent of the transnational repression instances documented in the Freedom House report involved 
bogus terrorism charges—as could be the case in Sunday's hijacking—as authoritarian states seek to cloak their 
crackdowns in the guise of national security. 
 It's difficult to gauge whether such instances are on the rise, said Nate Schenkkan, director of research strategy at 
Freedom House, but he said two things may have emboldened despots to reach out in pursuit of their critics. The 
first is new technology, which has made it possible for exiles to broadcast their messages to audiences back home, 
but has also supercharged opportunities for state surveillance. The second is that they've been able to get away 
with it. 
 'There's really not been consistent and strong consequences for these activities,' Schenkkan said. 
 Human rights advocates were frustrated by the Biden administration's decision not to impose penalties on Saudi 
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, despite intelligence assessments that he approved the murder of 
Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, in an apparent bid to preserve the United States' working 
relationship with Saudi Arabia. 
 'In diplomacy, everyone is always watching everyone else. And perceptions of others are shaped by how one 
country or group of countries treats another,' said Nigel Gould-Davies, a former British ambassador to Belarus. 
 It is unclear how sanctions alone could convince Lukashenko to release Protasevich; the Belarusian leader is 
already viewed as an international pariah, and Belarus's autocratic, largely state-controlled economy is poorly 
integrated with the West, giving few points of leverage. Possibilities include expanding sanctions on state 
companies, banning the national airline Belavia from landing at EU airports, kicking Belarus out of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization, or even booting the country from Interpol. Minsk has issued spurious Interpol red 
notices, roughly akin to an international arrest warrant, as a way to harass and disrupt the travel of critics overseas. 
Belarus 'Hijacking' Opens New Playbook for Autocrats
 Since protests broke out last August, the Belarusian government has waged a steady and brutal war of attrition 
against the country's citizens in which people have been arrested for simply displaying the red-and-white flag 
associated with the opposition or even wearing socks[5] with the same colors. Early last week, Tut.by, the country's 
most popular news site not controlled by the state, was shut down. Later in the week, news broke that opposition 
activist Vitold Ashurak had died in unclear circumstances in prison, where he was serving a five-year sentence for 
participating in anti-government protests. 
 International attention toward the crisis had begun to flag, and demonstrations have waned as the authorities have 
exacted a punishing toll on protesters. But Sunday's decision to intercept a civilian airline with a fighter jet promises 
to slingshot Belarus back to the top of Europe's agenda. 
 'What Lukashenko did today makes no sense to be honest. Street activity is at its lowest point for over a year now,' 
Giczan said in an interview on Sunday.

 Lukashenko understands that you need a certain flair to stand out among all of the reactionary authoritarian 
leaders out there today:[1] 
The strongman president of Belarus sent a fighter jet to intercept a European airliner traveling through the country's 
airspace on Sunday and ordered the plane to land in the capital, Minsk, where a prominent opposition journalist 
aboard was then seized, provoking international outrage. 
The stunning gambit by Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, a brutal and erratic leader who has clung to power despite huge 
protests against his government last year, was condemned by European officials, who compared it to hijacking. It 
underscored that with the support of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Lukashenko is prepared to go to 
extraordinary lengths to repress dissent. 
The Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius, Lithuania, carrying some 170 passengers — among them the journalist, 
Roman Protasevich — was flying over Belarus when Belarusian air traffic controllers notified its pilots of 'a potential 
security threat on board' and directed the plane to divert to Minsk, the Ireland-based airline said in a statement. 
This larger problem this represents is going to get worse before it gets better.

 A defiant Belarus on Monday defended its forced diversion of a European plane carrying an opposition activist, 
after the unprecedented move provoked a global outcry and calls for a tough response. 
 The Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius carrying dissident journalist Roman Protasevichwas diverted while in 
Belarusian airspace on Sunday over a supposed bomb threat. 
 Accompanied by a Belarusian fighter jet, it landed in the capital Minsk where Protasevich, a 26-year-old who had 
been living between EU states Poland and Lithuania, was arrested along with his girlfriend. 
 Accusing strongman Alexander Lukashenko's regime of essentially hijacking a European plane, Western leaders 
insisted the move would not go unanswered. 
 Many in Europe called for tough new sanctions to be agreed at a pre-planned summit on Monday, while 
Washington denounced the 'shocking act' and demanded Protasevich's release. 
 In its first official reaction to the incident, Belarus's foreign ministry insisted the country had acted legally and 
accused the West of trying to play politics. 
 'There is no doubt that the actions of our competent authorities fully met established international rules,' ministry 
spokesman Anatoly Glaz said in a statement, accusing the West of 'politicising' the situation. 
 'Unfounded accusations are being made,' he said. 
- 'Act of state terrorism' - 
The EU and other Western countries have already imposed a wide range of sanctions on Lukashenko's 
government over a brutal crackdown on opposition demonstrations that followed his disputed re-election to a sixth 
term last August. 
 Together with co-founder Stepan Putilo, Protasevich until recently ran the Nexta telegram channel that galvanised 
and directed the protests, which were the biggest challenge to Lukashenko's rule since he took power in the ex-
Soviet country in 1994. 
 The diversion of the plane was roundly condemned in Europe, with EU chief Ursula von der Leyen describing it as 
'outrageous and illegal', Poland denouncing it as 'an act of state terrorism' and France calling for a 'strong and 
united response'. 
Defiant Belarus defends diversion of plane carrying activist
 NATO demanded a probe into the 'serious and dangerous incident' while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken 
called it 'a shocking act' that 'endangered the lives of more than 120 passengers, including US citizens'. 
 Belarus's main ally Russia showed little concern however, with foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova 
mocking the Western indignation. 
 'We are shocked that the West calls the incident in Belarusian air space 'shocking,'' Zakharova said on Facebook, 
accusing Western nations of 'kidnappings, forced landings and illegal arrests'. 
 Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to comment on the incident, saying it was up to international aviation 
authorities to evaluate what had happened. 
 Latvia-based regional airline airBaltic said it would now be avoiding Belarusian airspace. 
 With close to two million subscribers on Telegram, Nexta Live and its sister channel Nexta are prominent 
opposition channels and helped mobilise protesters in Belarus. 
 Protasevich and Putilo were added to Belarus's list of 'individuals involved in terrorist activity' last year. 
 The two were accused of causing mass unrest, an offence punishable by up to 15 years in jail. 
 'It is absolutely obvious that this is an operation of secret services to capture the plane in order to detain activist 
and blogger Roman Protasevich,' exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said on Telegram. 
 The opposition says that Tikhanovskaya, who fled to neighbouring Lithuania after last year's presidential election, 
was the true winner of the vote. 
- 'KGB on board' - 
A member of the Nexta team, Tadeusz Giczan, tweeted that representatives of the Belarusian security agency had 
been on Protasevich's flight. 
 'Then when the plane had entered Belarus airspace, the KGB officers initiated a fight with the Ryanair crew 
insisting there's an IED (improvised explosive device) onboard,' he said. 
 Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said it appeared that agents of the Belarusian KGB were on the plane and 
also deboarded in Minsk. 
 'I think it's the first time it's happened to a European airline,' O'Leary told Ireland's Newstalk radio. 'It was a state-
sponsored hijacking, it was state-sponsored piracy.' 
 Passengers described seeing Protasevich looking nervous as the flight was diverted to Minsk. 
 'He started panicking and saying this was because of him,' Monika Simkiene, a 40-year-old Lithuanian, told AFP 
after the plane finally landed in Vilnius several hours later than its scheduled arrival time. 
 'He just turned to people and said he was facing the death penalty.' 
 His girlfriend Sofia Sapega — a Russian citizen and law student at the European Humanities University (EHU) in 
Lithuania — was arrested along with him, her university confirmed on Monday.

 German flagship airline Lufthansa (LHA.F) said a flight that was momentarily suspended as a result of a "security 
warning" safely took off from Minsk on Monday, a day after the forced diversion of a Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) 
airplane to Belarus' capital.
A Lufthansa spokesman was quoted by AFP as saying that all passengers were on board, with the aircraft leaving

 May 24, 2021, 1:26 PM  
 On Sunday, a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, was forced out of the sky as it 
traversed Belarusian airspace. The government of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who has clung to 
power despite widespread protests[1] following a rigged election last August, ordered the plane to make an 
emergency landing in Minsk under the pretext of a faked bomb threat, carried out by Belarusian security operatives. 
In an audacious move that sparked a European security crisis, Belarus authorities scrambled a fully armed MiG-29 
fighter jet to intercept the civilian flight. 
 This unprecedented act, denounced by European officials as air piracy, was all aimed at capturing a single man: 
Roman Protasevich, one of the Belarussian dissidents who has been a constant thorn in Lukashenko's side. 
Protasevich was pulled off the plane, along with several other Belarusian and Russian nationals. Vilnius has 
become a hub of opposition to Lukashenko's rule, with Lithuania rejecting Lukashenko's legitimacy and providing 
support and protection to exiles. 
 I was already in Vilnius to interview Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya as the crisis began. She 
told Foreign Policy: 'We demand the invitation of an investigation into this incident and the start of the process of 
suspending Belarus's membership in the International Civil Aviation Organization. The time for statements has 
passed. It is obvious that the Belarusians expect decisive action and help from the international community. From 
now on, not a single person from any country in the world who flies over Belarus is guaranteed basic security.' 
 Amid the opposition, struggling to process the news, there is growing fear and panic. One of Tikhanovskaya's 
aides said on Sunday evening it now seems Lukashenko's security forces are capable of reaching them anywhere. 
Unless the European Union acts, there may be no safe haven for a beleaguered democratic opposition. Exiles 
bleakly compared their home country to Somalia, known for piracy at sea, or to the isolated and murderous state of 
North Korea. 
 Exiled 26-year old Belarusian journalist Protasevich was a central figure in the work of the NEXTA news channel 
on Telegram, an encrypted messaging act that has become a key part of opposition in Russia and Belarus. Along 
with some intrepid independent journalists still based in Belarus itself, NEXTA and other Telegram channels have 
continued to provide critical coverage of the repressions and arrests of political prisoners in Belarus. The crisis 
Belarus Is Becoming Europe's North Korea
comes a week after Tut.By, the last serious independent news site operating and reporting in Belarus, was 
shuttered[2] by authorities, with some of its employees charged with tax-related crimes. 
 Protasevich and his Russian girlfriend were detained by Belarusian security service agents on the tarmac of 
Minsk's airport. Before boarding the flight in Athens, Protasevich had sent messages to his colleagues that 
suspicious characters were monitoring him and had ostentatiously attempted to photograph his travel documents at 
the boarding gate. Several of his fellow passengers reportedly stated the terrified journalist had expressed concerns 
he would be 'executed' and had attempted to hand his cellular phones and laptop computer to his girlfriend to keep 
them from being taken. 
 Yet the flight was just 2 minutes away from penetrating Lithuanian airspace, spurring a bout of criticism for the 
decision to comply with the order. But with an armed fighter jet escorting them, the Ryanair pilots understandably 
felt they had little choice. The plane was detained before being allowed to continue the flight to Vilnius—with the 
remaining passengers from 12 different European nations allowed to leave Belarus after being essentially held 
hostage for 7 hours. Four Russian nationals and several other Belarusian passengers, presumably also detained or 
themselves being intelligence officers, did not return to the flight. 
 The incident has fundamentally transformed a situation that had threatened to develop into a political stalemate 
and has forced European diplomats to confront a situation many of them may likely have preferred to go away 
quietly. The Polish government initiated an investigation[3] into the incident early on Monday. The brazen act was 
categorized by many observers as an act of 'state piracy.' Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary seconded that view as he 
said[4] it represented an instance of 'state-sponsored hijacking.' 
 By Monday afternoon in Europe, numerous foreign-policy officials throughout the European Union were engaged in 
a concerted debate over whether Belarus's airspace should be permanently closed off to flights in and out of 
Europe. Calls for a serious and concerted response to the crisis built up steam, such as a fourth set of sanctions 
and a total 'no-fly zone' being imposed over Belarusian territory. By Monday evening, the United Kingdom was the 
first European country to instruct its national airlines not to traverse Belarusian airspace and to cancel the landing 
rights of Belavia, the Belarusian national airline. 
 But that sparked a new round of arguments within the opposition about the dangers of complete isolation. Minsk 
already locked down its land borders last year when it accused NATO of preparing to invade the country. If the 
national airport is blocked, international travel in and out of Belarus will become formally impossible, save for those 
brave enough to sneak across the border in an echo of the days of the Iron Curtain. 
 Belarus seems undeterred. On Monday afternoon, Minsk authorities stopped a Lufthansa flight from taking off for 2 
hours while citing an amorphous terrorism threat. The incident was allegedly based on an emailed bomb threat, and 
all passengers were forced to disembark from the plane while it was searched. It's unclear whether the authorities 
were attempting to provide a transparently flimsy justification for Sunday's piracy or simply exerting their power—
perhaps fearing other exiles on the plane. A bizarre press conference followed, ludicrously attempting to blame the 
threat on Hamas. 
 Lukashenko has often been referred to as the last dictator[5] in Europe. But Belarusians have struggled not to be 
defined by their country's authoritarianism and to keep engagement with the rest of Europe alive. If travel ends, the 
country's isolation may be complete and its transformation into Europe's North Korea ever closer.

 Belarus moved first, expelling all staff at Latvia's embassy in protest at opposition flags being hoisted at an ice 
hockey tournament. Minsk is currently the focus of outrage over its forced landing of a passenger jet.Belarusian 
Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei on Monday said the entire Latvian embassy in Minsk had been asked to leave the 
country by midweek. 
The decision was in response to Latvian authorities raising Belarusian opposition flags at an ice hockey 
championship. 
The Latvian officials apparently hoisted the flags in a show of solidarity amid international outrage over Belarus' 
forced landing of a passenger jet on Sunday. 
'Insulting the national flag' 
Makei said Belarus was expelling the entire staff of Latvia's embassy, including the ambassador. 
The minister said Latvia's ambassador, Einars Semanis, had been summoned to the foreign ministry on Monday 
and given 24 hours to leave. 
According the state-run news agency Belta, Makei said the summons was for "insulting the national flag." 
"A strong protest was expressed to the ambassador in connection with the situation," Belta quoted Makei as saying. 
The rest of the embassy staff were given 48 hours to leave, with one member of the administrative staff allowed to 
remain to look after the building. 
Latvia responded soon afterward with the reciprocal expulsions of Belarusian diplomats. 
One nation, two sets of colors 
The switch of flags took place at the 2021 Ice Hockey World Championship, which Belarus had been due to cohost. 
Belarus was excluded from its role in the tournament over "security concerns," and Riga was named the sole host. 
The organizers raised the opposition's red-and-white flag — a symbol of the short-lived Belarusian National 
Republic in 1918 that has become a rallying point for opponents of Lukashenko. The flag was readopted in 1991 
when Belarus won independence from Moscow, but done away with in 1994 when Lukashenko came to power. 
Belarus' current official red-green flag includes and embroidered pattern and dates back to 1951, when the country 
was still part of the Soviet Union. 
International outrage over forced landing 
The change of flags came as Belarus came under fire from European leaders for forcing a Ryanair passenger flight 
from Greece to the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, to land in Minsk on Sunday. 
Belarus and Latvia expel diplomats in ice hockey flag furor
Belarusian officials then swooped on the plane to detain blogger journalist and opposition activist Raman 
Pratasevich. 
The arrest was the boldest in a series of moves by Lukashenko's government to crack down on opposition figures 
and members of the press. 
The campaign targeting opposition and independent media follows mass protests against Lukashenko. The 
longtime leader was re-elected for a sixth term in a disputed election in August 2020. 
More than 34,000 people have been arrested in Belarus since August, with thousands of protesters beaten by 
security forces.

The fines come as airlines canceled flights after travel restrictions were lifted in June 2020 using the COVID-19 
pandemic as motivation and offering only vouchers and not reimbursing the tickets. 
Ryanair received a higher fine because it ran ads claiming free rescheduling in the same month as it was still

EU cuts air links with Belarus over forced plane landing

 EU leaders agreed to cut air links with Belarus on Monday, as leader Alexander Lukashenko's regime paraded a 
dissident journalist arrested after his flight was forced to land in Minsk. 
 Strongman Lukashenko sparked international outrage by dispatching a fighter jet Sunday to intercept a Ryanair 
flight from Athens to Vilniuscarrying wanted reporter Roman Protasevich, 26, and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega. 
 European leaders meeting in Brussels hit back by agreeing to ban Belarusian airlines from the bloc's airspace and 
urged EU-based carriers not to fly over its airspace. 
 The bloc also said it would adopt further 'targeted economic sanctions' against the Belarusian authorities to add to 
the 88 regime figures and seven companies already on a blacklist over a crackdown on opposition. 
 The move came as Belarusian state television broadcast a 30-second video of Protasevich, who had been living 
between Lithuania and Poland, confirming that he was in prison in Minsk and 'confessing' to charges of organising 
mass unrest.

 The footage showed Protasevich — who could face 15 years in jail — with dark markings visible on his forehead, 
saying he was being treated 'according to the law'. 
 'This is how (Roman) looks under physical and moral pressure,' exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana 
Tikhanovskaya wrote on Twitter. 
 The EU leaders demanded the 'immediate release' of Protasevich and Sapega, the conclusions of the summit said. 
 - 'Outrageous behaviour' - 
 The forced landing of an airliner flying between EU nations has refocused attention on the festering political crisis 
in Belarus, where Lukashenko has unleashed waves of brutal repression to cling to power. 
 Western leaders accused Belarusian authorities of essentially hijacking a European plane, while Minsk claimed it 
had reacted to secure the flight after receiving a bomb threat. 
 'It is outrageous behaviour and Lukashenko and his regime have to understand that this will have severe 
consequences,' EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said. 
EU cuts air links with Belarus over forced plane landing
 The EU's push to punish Minsk followed announcements from some nations and airlines that they were cutting 
links to Belarus. 
 London also said it had issued instructions for British aircraft to avoid Belarusian airspace. 
 Ukraine said it would halt direct flights between the two countries and over Belarus, while Scandinavian airline 
SAS, Germany's Lufthansa and Latvia-based regional airline Air Baltic said they would be avoiding Belarusian 
airspace. 
 In a bid to heighten pressure on Lukashenko, Berlin, London and Brussels summoned the Belarusian 
ambassadors. 
 - 'Completely implausible' - 
 Belarus has insisted it acted legally over the grounding of the Ryanair jet, accusing the West of making 'unfounded 
accusations' for political reasons. 
 Its air force chief said the plane's captain had decided to land in Belarus 'without outside interference' and that the 
pilot could have chosen to go to Ukraine or Poland. 
 A senior Belarusian transport official said the authorities received a letter claiming to be from the Palestinian 
Islamist group Hamas threatening to blow up the plane over Vilnius unless the EU renounced support for Israel. 
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel dismissed Minsk's explanations as 'completely implausible' and the EU 
demanded a probe by the International Civil Aviation Organization. 
 The ICAO, a UN agency, is to meet on Thursday. 
 United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres backed calls for a 'full, transparent and independent 
investigation into this disturbing incident'. 
 - 'Shocking act' - 
 NATO slammed a 'serious and dangerous incident' and said envoys from the military alliance were to discuss it on 
Tuesday. 
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called it 'a shocking act'. 
 The EU and other Western countries have already imposed a wide range of sanctions on Lukashenko's 
government over its crackdown on opposition demonstrations that followed his disputed re-election to a sixth term 
last August. 
 But Lukashenko has remained defiant with help from his main backer Russia. 
 Britain's Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab raised the possibility of that Russian had backed the operation. 
 'It's very difficult to believe that this kind of action could have been taken without at least the acquiescence of the 
authorities in Moscow,' he told parliament. 
 But Moscow has dismissed the outrage in the West. 
 Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Minsk was taking an 'absolutely reasonable approach' while ministry 
spokeswoman Maria Zakharova mocked the Western indignation. 
 'We are shocked that the West calls the incident in Belarusian air space 'shocking,'' Zakharova said on Facebook, 
accusing Western nations of 'kidnappings, forced landings and illegal arrests'. 
 Together with co-founder Stepan Putilo, Protasevich until recently ran the Nexta channel on messaging app 
Telegram, which helped organise the protests that were the biggest challenge to Lukashenko's 26-year rule. 
 With close to two million subscribers on Telegram, Nexta Live and its sister channel Nexta are prominent 
opposition channels and helped mobilise protesters in Belarus. 
 Protasevich and Putilo were added to Belarus's list of 'individuals involved in terrorist activity' last year. 
 The spiralling tensions around Belarus were in evidence as Minsk expelled the entire staff of Latvia's embassy, 
including the ambassador, after accusing Latvian authorities of having used an opposition flag at an ice hockey 
championship.

 The forced landing of a Ryanair passenger airplane by Belarusian officials was 'a state-sponsored hijacking" meant 
to target a journalist and dissident on board, Michael O'Leary, the airline's CEO, told Politico[1].  
Why it matters: The diversion of the plane was an attempt by Belarus President Aleksandr Lukashenko to "remove" 
journalist Roman Protasevich, a prominent opposition figure living in exile, O'Leary said. Lukashenko, known as 
"Europe's last dictator, has cracked down on mass protests and dissent in the wake of a fraudulent election last 
year.How European Union leaders respond to the hijacking, which O'Leary said involved Belarus KGB agents, will 
be a key test for the bloc's foreign policy. Catch up quick: The plane was in Belarusian airspace headed to Lithuania 
when pilots were told to land in Minsk because of 'a potential security threat on board," per a Ryanair statement[2]. 
Protasevich, who reportedly told[3] other passengers he was facing the death penalty, was arrested during the stop. 
No bomb was found on board.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and top EU officials have demanded 
Protasevich's immediate release. What he's saying: 'It was clear that the intent of the Belarusian authorities was to 
remove a journalist and his traveling companion. We believe some KGB agents were offloaded from the aircraft as 
well,' O'Leary told Politico. 'This is a case of state-sponsored hijacking, state-sponsored piracy. Our crew did a 
phenomenal job to get that aircraft and almost all the passengers out of Minsk after six hours.'#8216;It was 
extremely frightening for our crew and passengers. They were held under armed guard and had their bags 
searched.' Go deeper: Global outcry as Belarus accused of "hijacking" plane to detain activist[4]

 European countries began banning flights over Belarus Monday after it provoked an international outcry by forcing 
a commercial airliner to land so it could arrest an opposition activist. 
 The Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius carrying dissident journalist Roman Protasevichwas diverted while in 
Belarusian airspace on Sunday over a supposed bomb threat. 
 Accompanied by a Belarusian fighter jet on the orders of strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko, the plane 
landed in the capital Minsk. There Protasevich, a 26-year-old, who had been living between Lithuania and Poland, 
was arrested along with his Russian girlfriend. 
 Western leaders accused Belarusian authorities of essentially hijacking a European plane, while Minsk claimed it 
had received a threat from Islamist group Hamas to blow up the aircraft. 
 As EU leaders prepared to meet for a summit where they are expected to discuss new sanctions, several 
governments and airlines said they were stopping flights over or with Belarus. 
 Britain and Lithuania said they had issued instructions for their countries' aircraft to avoid Belarusian airspace, with 
London going a step further by banning Belarus's flag carrier Belavia. 
 Ukraine said it would halt direct flights between the two countries and over Belarus, while Scandinavian airline SAS 
and Latvia-based regional airline airBaltic said they would be avoiding Belarusian airspace. 
- 'North Korea in Europe' - 
Berlin, London and Brussels summoned the Belarusian ambassadors, as exiled opposition leader Svetlana 
Tikhanovskaya called for an independent probe, new sanctions and for Minsk to be excluded from international 
aviation bodies. 
 'An act of state terrorism was carried out and now any passengers flying over Belarus in a civilian aircraft will be in 
danger,' Tikhanovskaya told reporters in Vilnius. 
 'The regime has turned our country into North Korea in the middle of Europe,' she said. 
 The EU and other Western countries have already imposed a wide range of sanctions on Lukashenko's 
government over a brutal crackdown on opposition demonstrations that followed his disputed re-election to a sixth 
term last August. 
Pressure mounts on Belarus over forced landing to arrest dissident
 Together with co-founder Stepan Putilo, Protasevich until recently ran the Nexta telegram channel that helped 
organise protests that were the biggest challenge to Lukashenko's rule since he took power in the ex-Soviet country 
in 1994. 
 Belarus insisted it had acted legally, accusing the West of making 'unfounded accusations' for political reasons. 
 Its air force chief said the plane's captain had decided to land in Belarus 'without outside interference' and that the 
pilot could have chosen to go to Ukraine or Poland. 
 A senior transport official, Artem Sikorsky, told journalists that authorities in Minsk had received a letter claiming to 
be from Hamas threatening to blow up the plane over Vilnius unless the EU renounced support for Israel. 
- 'Shocking act' - 
The diversion of the plane has been roundly condemned in Europe. 
 EU chief Ursula von der Leyen described it as 'outrageous and illegal', Poland denounced it as 'an act of state 
terrorism' and France called for a 'strong and united response'. 
 NATO demanded a probe into the 'serious and dangerous incident' and alliance envoys were to discuss it on 
Tuesday. 
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called it 'a shocking act' that 'endangered the lives of more than 120 
passengers, including US citizens'. 
 Belarus's main ally Russia showed little concern, however. 
 Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Minsk was taking an 'absolutely reasonable approach' while ministry 
spokeswoman Maria Zakharova mocked the Western indignation. 
 'We are shocked that the West calls the incident in Belarusian air space 'shocking,'' Zakharova said on Facebook, 
accusing Western nations of 'kidnappings, forced landings and illegal arrests'. 
 Britain's Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab raised the possibility of Russian backing for the diversion. 
 'It's very difficult to believe that this kind of action could have been taken without at least the acquiescence of the 
authorities in Moscow,' he told parliament. 
 Even before Monday's summit, the EU was working on a newround of measures that was expected to see dozens 
more officials added to an asset freeze and visa ban blacklist in the coming weeks. 
 Those sanctions could now be expedited and Brussels is expected to propose more measures in response to the 
forced landing, an EU source said. 
 'We are assessing the situation and do not rule out any action,' the source said. 
 The growing tensions were in evidence as Belarus expelled the entire staff of Latvia's embassy, including the 
ambassador, after accusing Latvian authorities of having used an opposition flag at an ice hockey championship. 
 With close to two million subscribers on Telegram, Nexta Live and its sister channel Nexta are prominent 
opposition channels and helped mobilise protesters in Belarus. 
 Protasevich and Putilo were added to Belarus's list of 'individuals involved in terrorist activity' last year. 
 The two were accused of causing mass unrest, an offence punishable by up to 15 years in jail.

The European Union is readying to seal off its airspace and airports to Belarusian airlines after a flight between two 
EU states was forcibly diverted to Minsk.
In a statement shared on Twitter by European Council President Charles Michel's spokesperson Barend Leyts, the 
bloc instructed officials to "adopt necessary measures to ban overflight of EU airspace by Belarusian airlines and 
prevent access to EU airports."
The 27 leaders also urged all EU-based carriers to avoid flying over Belarusian territory in the joint declaration, 
approved at a summit in Brussels on Monday evening.
The member states demanded the release of detained Belarusian opposition journalist Roman Protasevich and his 
partner Sofia Sapega, and also called on the International Civil Aviation Organization to "urgently investigate" the 
incident.
The EU also decided to sanction Belarusian individuals involved in the forced landing of the Ryanair flight between 
Athens and Vilnius on Sunday, which some leaders have slammed as a "state hijacking."
In addition, a package of economic sanctions should be prepared, the EU statement continued.

Latvian airline Air Baltic announced on Monday that it will avoid Belarusian airspace until further notice, after a 
Ryanair passenger flight was forced to land in Minsk the previous day, apparently so authorities could detain a 
dissident on board.
The airline said that it would stay out of Belarus' airspace until the situation became clearer or authorities issue a 
decision.
Latvia's Civil Aviation Authority is expected to make a recommendation soon, according to Transport Minister Talis 
Linkaits.
"It is clear that the situation in principle is unacceptable when a country can decide whether it likes or dislikes one or 
another passenger on the plane," Linkaits told a Latvian radio broadcaster.
Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics broached the idea of a ban on flights by Belarusian airlines, in addition to 
economic sanctions and the closing of Belarusian airspace to international flights.
However, no official decision has been made so far, says Linkaits.

The United States has demanded the "immediate release" of dissident journalist Roman Protasevich, who was 
arrested when Belarusian authorities diverted a Ryanair plane flying to Minsk.
Ryanair said its plane was flying from Greece to Lithuania on Sunday when it was notified of "a potential security 
threat on board" by air traffic controllers in Belarus and told to divert to Minsk for an emergency landing.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken strongly condemned the forced diversion and Protasevich's arrest. Belarusian 
state media earlier reported that the country's President Alexander Lukashenko ordered the diversion.
"This shocking act perpetrated by the Lukashenka regime endangered the lives of more than 120 passengers, 
including U.S. citizens," Blinken said in a statement.
"Initial reports suggesting the involvement of the Belarusian security services and the use of Belarusian military 
aircraft to escort the plane are deeply concerning and require full investigation."
The US said it was coordinating its response with partners including the EU and Lithuanian and Greek officials.

Western countries have condemned Belarus for diverting a plane flying over its territory to arrest a Belarusian 
opposition journalist. 
 EU leaders are due to discuss their response to what the union's executive called a 'hijacking' and the US state 
department said was 'a shocking act'. 
Belarus scrambled a fighter jet to force the plane - bound for Lithuania - to land, claiming a bomb threat. 
Police came and took Roman Protasevich away when passengers disembarked. 
The 26-year-old was aboard the Ryanair plane, which was flying from the Greek capital, Athens. The aircraft was 
due to land in Vilnius, but was still in Belarusian airspace when it was told to divert it to their own capital, Minsk. 
Witnesses said the activist was 'super-scared' and told fellow passengers he would face the death penalty - Belarus 
is the only European country that still executes prisoners. 
State media in Belarus saidPresident Alexander Lukashenko had personally given the order[1]for the move. The 
plane landed in Vilnius more than six hours after its scheduled arrival. More[2]

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary believes that KGB agents were aboard the passenger flight that was 
forced to land in Minsk at the weekend.
"It appears the intent of the authorities was to remove a journalist and his travelling companion," the head of the 
Irish budget airline told radio broadcaster Newstalk on Monday. "We believe there were some KGB agents 
offloaded at the airport as well," he added.
O'Leary praised the flight crew for handling the situation well and said the incident was frightening for passengers 
and staff, who were detained for hours by gunmen in Belarus after the emergency landing.
Belarusian authorities dispatched a fighter jet to force a Ryanair flight to divert to Minsk on Sunday. Dissident 
journalist Roman Protasevich, who was on board, was then detained.

Lithuania has launched a preliminary investigation into the forced diversion of a commercial flight to Belarus, the 
Lithuanian Prosecutor-General's Office has said.
Passengers and crew of the diverted aircraft which finally landed in Vilnius on Sunday evening are to be among 
those interviewed by Lithuanian police.
"We expect them to work with law enforcement authorities and provide our officers with all the information they 
know," Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said after a meeting with passengers at Vilnius airport.
The Lithuanian government strongly condemned the diversion of the Ryanair flight and spoke of an "act of state 
terrorism" directed against the security of citizens of the EU and other countries.
The government in Vilnius vowed that it will work with international partners to block Belarusian airspace for 
international flights.

 The forced landing of a Ryanair plane in Minsk has resulted in the imprisonment of a dissident journalist. The 
president has raised the stakes on reporting in Belarus, a colleague of the arrested journalist writes.On Sunday, 
authorities in Belarus forced a Ryanair plane to land in the capital, Minsk, citing a bomb threat. When it became 
clear that the aircraft was being diverted, one passenger's reaction stood out.  
A young man grabbed his head in panic. Once the plane landed, passengers left the plane and their belongings 
were checked. Security forces approached the man. He felt calmer but was still trembling. Shortly before they took 
him away in an unknown direction, he told people who were around: "A death penalty awaits me here." 
It was Raman Pratasevich, a 26-year-old Belarusian blogger and journalist. He knew that his unexpected visit to 
Belarus meant a certain arrest, because he is on a terrorist watch list drawn up by the State Security Committee, 
still known as the KGB. 
'Potential security threat' 
Pratasevich was on his way back from Athens to Vilnius, Lithuania, where he is based. Belarusian President 
Alexander Lukashenko personally ordered a MiG-29 jet fighter to escort the civilian plane to the Minsk airport. In a 
statement, Ryanair said the crew had been "notified by Belarus Air Traffic Control of a potential security threat on 
board and were instructed to divert to the nearest airport, Minsk." 
The journalist had left Belarus for Poland in 2019 in fear of arrest. From there, he worked as the editor-in-chief of 
the influential Telegram channels Nexta and Nexta Live, which became the main source of information about 
protests when the internet was shut down after the disputed presidential election in August. 
Since November, Pratasevich — like Nexta founder Stsiapan Putsila — has been on the government's list of more 
than 700 "individuals involved in terrorist activities." 
Lukashenko targets press 
With most opposition leaders having left Belarus, Nexta has played a key role in spreading information, posting 
updates, giving the time and location of rallies, and revealing facts about police brutality. Lukashenko, who has 
ruled Belarus since 1994, has accused social media and independent journalists of being responsible for organizing 
and coordinating mass opposition rallies. 
When asked if he was afraid that Lukashenko's agents might get to him in Poland, Pratasevich said he was in the 
process of obtaining refugee status and would not be deported. A request for Raman's extradition had previously 
been sent by the Belarusian authorities to Poland's government, which did not comply. 
Why Lukashenko diverted a plane to catch Belarusian blogger
Four prominent activists who are members of the Polish minority in Belarus were arrested — including the 
community leaders Andzelika Borys and Andrzej Poczobut. They were charged with breaching rules on mass 
gatherings during an annual folk fair, as well as inciting national and religious hatred, a charge punishable with a 
prison sentence of up to 12 years. The arrests have been accompanied by anti-Polish propaganda on state TV. 
The regime launched a war on journalists and bloggers in Belarus months before last summer's election. In June, 
Ihar Losik, a consultant for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) and the founder of another influential 
Telegram channel, Belarus of the Brain, was detained. Since then, the already dire situation has worsened. 
Raid on tut.by 
On May 18, security services raided the offices of tut.by, the largest media outlet in Belarus, as well as apartments 
of the website's journalists. The portal's editor-in-chief, Maryna Zolatava, and other journalists were arrested. 
For over 20 years, tut.by has been popular among Belarusians, no matter their political views. Lukashenko's 
officials read tut.by, and so did his opponents. The website's reach set a record high in May — right before it was 
blocked — with its monthly unique users hitting 3.3 million, or 63% of Belarusian internet users.  
Dozens of independent news portals have already been blocked, hundreds of journalists were arrested or detained, 
and a number of newspapers have stopped being printed. But this was not enough. Lukashenko has continually 
raised the stakes of reporting in Belarus. 
Pratasevich's trumped-up charges 
Pratasevich is facing charges on at least three criminal counts. One of them is on "plotting mass riots," which is 
punishable by up to 15 years in prison. There haven't been any accusations yet publicly made related to the 
allegations of his "terrorist' activities. But, as he is most probably being held in the KGB prison in Minsk, a lawyer 
was not allowed to see him. There is practically no information as to his health and the conditions in which he is 
being held. 
At the time of his arrest, Pratasevich was working for Losik's Belarus of the Brain. Both are my friends. Although 
they have different personalities — Ihar is a quiet introvert while Raman is a loud extrovert — they share many 
similarities. Both were on the radar of Belarusian law enforcement since at least 2011, when they were involved in 
the so-called Revolution Through Social Networks in Minsk and other cities. Both were awarded a Vaclav Havel 
Journalism Fellowship at RFE/RL. Both are now jailed. 
Bloggers became the first target for Lukashenko, who wants to silence the dissent. He must believe that it is 
technology — not his rule, human rights violations and the widespread poverty in Belarus — that brought people to 
the streets. So far, he has fought his opponents within Belarus. On Sunday, he proved that there are no bounds for 
his repressions.

Boarding for a Lufthansa flight from Belarus' capital, Minsk, bound for Frankfurt was cancelled due to a warning 
notice, the German airline confirmed to dpa on Monday.
According to the statement, all passengers will be subjected to another security check before departure, and the 
plane will be searched again as well, meaning all cargo will also be unloaded.
Fifty-one passengers, including five crew members, are affected.
The additional caution follows the forced landing of a Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania by Belarus this 
weekend that led to the arrest of a dissident journalist. Several airlines have cancelled their flights in Belarusian 
airspace following the incident.

A Russian woman was also detained when a Ryanair flight headed to Lithuania was required to land in Minsk this 
weekend - for what EU officials say was a "hijacking" so Belarus could detain a dissident journalist on the plane - 
says a Kremlin spokesperson.
The unnamed woman was accompanying the now-missing dissident, Roman Protasevich, said Russian Foreign 
Minister Sergei Lavrov in comments to the Interfax news agency. Multiple media outlets have reported that the 
woman is Protasevich's girlfriend.
Russia's embassy has reached out to the Foreign Ministry in Minsk to seek consular access to the woman and had 
also contacted the woman's father.
Belarusian human rights organization Viasna says the missing woman is a student at a university in Vilnius, in 
Lithuania. There has been no official comment from Belarus.

"There are international air travel guidelines, and it is the international air travel authorities that should assess 
whether these international standards were followed or not," said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov in 
comments to the Interfax news agency.
He also urged a "sober assessment" of the incident, noting that there are already calls for sanctions after a 
procedure which, he says, went according to international guidelines.
"We don't want to get involved in this race of condemning someone or supporting something," he said.

A trio of discount airlines were fined on Monday by Italian authorities because they only offered credits - not cash 
back - for flights that had to be cancelled last year amid the pandemic.
The fines affect Irish airline Ryanair, British airline Easyjet and Spanish airline Volotea and pertain to flights 
cancelled after June 3, 2020.
The AGCM competition authority said the businesses had employed confusing practices and provided confusing 
information to customers that left them unclear about their rights.
The decision to hand out credits, which could be used for subsequent flight purchases, made it harder for 
passengers to decide to seek cash reimbursement.
The authority's decision will require Ryanir to pay a 4.2-million-euro fine, while Easy jet will be on the hook for 2.8 
million euros and Volotea for 1.4 million euros.
The AGCM also noted that passengers on some airlines were not given the option of using a toll-free phone 
number if they wanted to call in to redeem the flight credits.

"The explanations given so far by the Belarusian government for the forced landing of a Ryanair plane in Minsk are 
absurd and not credible," Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Monday.
Maas said Belarus needed to give clarity on the welfare of Roman Protasevich and his partner and called on Minsk

The European Union could seal off its airspace and all airports to Belarusian airlines and call for all EU-based 
carriers to avoid flying over the country, according to a draft document seen by dpa.
If the 27 EU leaders agree to a draft brought forward by European Council President Charles Michel during their 
meeting on Monday, they will "strongly" condemn the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk.
According to the draft, which was confirmed as authentic by several EU diplomats, the European Council "calls on 
all EU-based carriers to avoid overflight of Belarus."
The leaders would also call on the relevant EU body to "to adopt the necessary measures to ban overflight of EU 
airspace by Belarusian airlines and prevent access to EU airports of flights operated by such airlines."
If adopted, the premiers will also call on the International Civil Aviation Organization to "urgently investigate" the 
incident. They also want to sanction additional Belarusian individuals.
One EU diplomat said they believed all EU member states supported the draft.

opponents of Belarus' authoritarian president, has been arrested after an airliner in which he was riding was 
diverted to Belarus because of a bomb threat. The presidential press service said President Alexander Lukashenko 
personally ordered that a MiG-29 fighter jet accompany the Ryanair plane — traveling from Athens, Greece, to 
Vilnius, Lithuania — to the Minsk airport. (AP Photo/Sergei Grits, File) 
BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union agreed Monday to impose sanctions against Belarus, including banning 
its airlines from using the airspace and airports of the 27-nation bloc, amid fury over the forced diversion of a 
passenger jet to arrest an opposition journalist. 
 In what EU leaders have called a brazen 'hijacking' of the Ryanair jetliner flying from Greece to Lithuania on 
Sunday, they also demanded the immediate release of the journalist, Raman Pratasevich, a key foe of authoritarian 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. 
 A brief video clip of Pratasevich, who ran a popular messaging app that played a key role in helping organize 
massive protests against Lukashenko, was shown on Belarusian state television Monday night, a day after he was 
removed from the Ryanair flight. 
 Sitting at a table with his hands folded in front of him and speaking rapidly, Pratasevich said he was in satisfactory 
health and said his treatment in custody was 'maximally correct and according to law.' He added that he was giving 
evidence to investigators about organizing mass disturbances. 
 In their unusually swift action in Brussels, the EU leaders also urged all EU-based carriers to avoid flying over 
Belarus, decided to impose sanctions on officials linked to Sunday's flight diversion, and urged the International 
Civil Aviation Organization to start an investigation into what they see as an unprecedented move and what some 
said amounted to state terrorism or piracy. 
 The leaders called on their council 'to adopt the necessary measures to ban overflight of EU airspace by 
Belarusian airlines and prevent access to EU airports of flights operated by such airlines.' In addition to Pratasevich, 
they also urged authorities in Minsk to release his Russian girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, who was taken off the plane 
with him. 
EU leaders agree on Belarus sanctions after plane diversion
 The text was endorsed quickly by leaders determined to oppose a 'strong reaction' to the incident because of the 
'serious endangering of aviation safety and passengers on board by Belarussian authorities,' according to an EU 
official with direct knowledge of the discussions who was not authorized to speak publicly about the private talks. 
(Ad) This just in! Strange laboratory creates psychedelic breakthrough... and could spark a new megatrend that 
every investor needs to know about! 
 Ryanair said Belarusian flight controllers told the crew there was a bomb threat against the plane as it was crossing 
through Belarus airspace on Sunday and ordered it to land. A Belarusian MiG-29 fighter jet was scrambled to escort 
the plane in a brazen show of force by Lukashenko, who has ruled the country with an iron fist for over a quarter-
century. 
 Belarus authorities then arrested the 26-year-old activist, journalist and prominent Lukashenko critic. Pratasevich 
and his Russian girlfriend were taken off the plane shortly after it landed, and authorities haven't said where they're 
being held. Ryanair Flight FR4978, which began in Athens, Greece, was eventually allowed to continue on to 
Vilnius, Lithuania. 
 U.S. President Joe Biden was briefed on the incident and National Security adviser Jake Sullivan raised the issue 
in his call with the secretary of the Russian Security Council, said White House press secretary Jen Psaki. She 
added the administration condemned what she called the 'shocking act' of diverting a flight to detain a journalist. 
 'It constitutes a brazen affront to international peace and security by the regime. We demand an immediate 
international, transparent and credible investigation of this incident,' she said, adding the U.S. was in touch with 
NATO, the EU, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, among others about next steps. 
 EU leaders were particularly forceful in their condemnation of the arrest and the move against the plane, which was 
flying between two of the bloc's member nations and was being operated by an airline based in Ireland, also a 
member. 
 The bloc summoned Belarus' ambassador 'to condemn the inadmissible step of the Belarusian authorities' and 
said in a statement the arrest was yet again 'another blatant attempt to silence all opposition voices in the country." 
 Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said 'the scandalous incident in Belarus shows signs of state terrorism and it's 
unbelievable," while EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it amounted to a 'hijacking.' 
 EU leaders have tried to bring Belarus closer to the bloc — to encourage democratic reforms and reduce the 
influence of Russia — but have failed so far. Ahead of their summit, some EU leaders threatened more sanctions — 
from scrapping landing rights in the bloc for Belarus' national carrier Belavia to exclusions from sports events. 
 Even before the EU acted, Latvia's airBaltic said it would avoid Belarusian airspace, and Lithuania's government 
said it would instruct all flights to and from the Baltic country to avoid Belarus as well starting Tuesday. 
 British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he instructed the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority 'to request airlines 
avoid Belarusian airspace in order to keep passengers safe.' He added he was suspending the permit allowing 
Belavia to operate in the U.K.  
 Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ordered officials to move to cut the air link with Belarus and ban Ukrainian 
flights via the neighbor's airspace. 
 The U.S. and the EU have imposed sanctions on top Belarusian officials amid months of protests, which were 
triggered by Lukashenko's reelection to a sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition rejected as rigged. 
More than 34,000 people have been arrested in Belarus since then, and thousands beaten. 
 The Belarusian Foreign Ministry bristled at what it described as 'belligerent' EU statements, insisting Minsk acted 
'in full conformity with international rules.' 
 It ordered all Latvian diplomats out of the country after the Belarusian flag was replaced Monday with the white-
and-red one used by the opposition at the world ice hockey championship in Riga, Latvia. The event was moved 
from Minsk amid the international outcry over the crackdown. 
 Lufthansa said a flight from Minsk to Frankfurt with 51 people aboard was delayed Monday following a 'security 
warning.' It was allowed to depart after the plane, passengers and cargo were searched. 
 On Sunday, flight tracker sites indicated the Ryanair flight was about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Lithuanian 
border when it was diverted. There were conflicting reports on what exactly happened. 
 Belarusian transport ministry official Artem Sikorsky said the Minsk airport had received an email about the bomb 
threat from the Palestinian militant group Hamas. 
 Lukashenko's press service said he had ordered a fighter jet to accompany the plane after being told of the bomb 
threat. Deputy air force commander Andrei Gurtsevich told Belarusian state TV that the Ryanair crew decided to 
land in Minsk, adding that the fighter jet was sent 'to ensure a safe landing." 
EU leaders agree on Belarus sanctions after plane diversion
 But Ryanair said in a statement that Belarusian air traffic control instructed the plane to divert to the capital. The 
plane was searched, and no bomb was found. 
 Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary described the move as 'a case of state-sponsored hijacking state-sponsored piracy.' 
 In an apparent reference to the Belarusian security agency that still goes under its Soviet-era name KGB, O'Leary 
he told the Irish radio station Newstalk that he believes 'some KGB agents offloaded from the aircraft' in Minsk. 
 Of the 126 people aboard the flight initially, only 121 made it to Vilnius, according to Rolandas Kiskis, chief of 
criminal police bureau in the Lithuanian capital where an investigation investigation has begun. 
 Passengers described Pratasevich's shock when he realized the plane was going to Minsk. 
 'I saw this Belarusian guy with girlfriend sitting right behind us. He freaked out when the pilot said the plane is 
diverted to Minsk. He said there's death penalty awaiting him there,' passenger Marius Rutkauskas said after the 
plane finally arrived in Vilnius. 'We sat for an hour after the landing. Then they started releasing passengers and 
took those two. We did not see them again.' 
 Pratasevich was a co-founder of the Telegram messaging app's Nexta channel, which played a prominent role in 
helping organize the anti-Lukashenko protests.  
 Nearly 2 million Belarusians in the nation of 9.3 million people have followed the channel, which has been the main 
conduit for organizing demonstrations and offered advice on how to dodge police cordons. It also has run photos, 
video and other materials documenting the brutal police crackdown on the protests.  
 Belarus authorities have labeled the channel 'extremist' and charged Pratasevich in absentia of inciting mass riots 
and fanning social hatred. He could face 15 years in prison if convicted. 
 In November, the Belarusian KGB put Pratasevich on a list of people suspected of involvement in terrorism, an 
ominous sign that he could face even graver charges. Terrorism is punishable by death in Belarus, the only country 
in Europe that maintains capital punishment. 
 Amid the international outrage, Moscow quickly offered a helping hand to its ally. 
 Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the episode needs to be investigated — but that it couldn't be rushed. 
Moscow and Minsk have close political, economic and military ties, and Lukashenko has relied on Russian support 
amid Western sanctions. 
 In a previous diversion of a passenger flight, a United Airlines flight in 2004 from London to Washington carrying 
the singer Yusuf Islam, better known as Cat Stevens, was sent to Bangor, Maine, where FBI agents met the plane 
and sent him back to England. U.S. officials said he was denied access to the United States on national security 
grounds. He later was allowed into the U.S.

Featured Article: What defines an oversold asset?[1] 
7 Penny Stocks That Don't Care About Robinhood[2] By the time you read this Vladimir Tenev, the CEO of the 
trading app Robinhood, will be testifying in front of Congress. The company's role in the GameStop (NYSE:GME) 
short squeeze will be called into question. 
 However, the real issue at stake is the right of traders to buy and sell the equities of their choice. In the case of 
Robinhood, some traders are buying a lot of penny stocks. While definitions vary, penny stocks are generally 
considered stocks that are trading for less than $10 per share. These stocks are largely ignored by the investment 
community. 
 One reason is that many of these stocks are cheap for a reason. For example, the company may have a business 
model that is out of date. In other cases, they operate in a very small, niche market that doesn't drive a lot of 
revenue. 
 And most of these stocks are ignored by the investment community. They simply aren't considered significant 
enough to spend time debating. 
 But some penny stocks do have the attention of Wall Street. And they're being largely ignored by the day trading 
community. The focus of this special presentation is to direct you to penny stocks that have a story that the 'smart 
money' thinks will eventually be trading at much higher prices. 
 And that's why you should be looking at them now.

 A law student from European Humanities University (EHU) was detained along with a Belarusian blogger after 
Belarus forced their commercial flight to land in Minsk rather than Lithuania.  
'As a result of a cover operation by the Belarusian authorities,' student Sofia Sapega 'was detained by the 
administration of the Investigative Committee for the city of Minsk on groundless and made-up conditions,' 
according to the university website.  
'Sapega is a Russian citizen studying International Law and European Union Law program at EHU,' the university 
wrote on its website. 'While returning with boyfriend [Raman Pratasevich] from vacation, Sofia was getting prepared 
for the defense of her master's thesis in Vilnius,' the university wrote[1].

 The White House has called for an international investigation into the diversion of a Ryanair flight into Belarus. 
Roman Protasevich, a journalist and prominent dissident, was detained from the flight after authorities reported a 
bogus security threat. See more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
The White House on Monday called[2] for an immediate international investigation into the diversion of a Ryanair 
flight into Minsk, Belarus, where authorities claimed a bogus security threat and arrested[3] Roman Protasevich, 
26,[4] a journalist and vocal dissident against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. 
Press Secretary Jen Psaki added that President Joe Biden was briefed on the situation and spoke with NATO 
allies. -POLITICO (@politico) May 24, 2021[5]  
Ryanair said in a statement that the pilots of flight FR4978, which was en route from Athens to Lithuania, were 
informed by Belarusian air traffic operators that there was a "potential security threat on board." The pilots were told 
instructed to "divert to the nearest airport," which was in Minsk.  
Authorities reportedly came on board to assess the threat, detained Protasevich, and left. Belarusian state TV 
posted[6] a video of Protasevich "confessing" to planning riots on Monday. Read the original article on Business

 I'm an avid reader and quite a few years back, I read anovel by John J. Nance[1]that described an attempt by 
international authorities to arrest a former American president for alleged war crimes as he traveled through Europe 
on an airliner. Truth can be stranger than fiction and Nance's scenario played out in the real world yesterday as w 
Belorussian MiG-29 jet fighter forced an airliner down so that authorities could arrest a journalist critical of the 
regime. 
Raman Pratasevich, a vocal critic of the regime of Alexander Lukashenko, was on board Ryanair flight 4978from 
Athens, Greece to Vilnius, Lithuania when it suddenly made a sharp turn to the east and landed in Minsk 
instead.CNN[2]reports that after the plane landed. Pratasevich was arrested. About seven hours later, the plane 
departed Minsk one passenger short. 
Exactly why the plane diverted is the subject of debate. Belorussian authorities claim that the crew made a 
precautionary landing in Minsk after being notified of a bomb threat. Ryanair claims the plane was 'notified by 
Belarus ATC [air traffic control] of a potential security threat on board and were instructed to divert to the nearest 
airport, Minsk." Both sides agree that Belorus dispatched a Mig-29 to escort the airliner to Minsk, although Belorus 
claims that the jet fighter was present to monitor the situation and assist if necessary. Franak Viačorka 
@franakviacorkaBREAKING! The regime landed @Ryanair plane, which was flying from Athens to Vilnius,in order 
to arrest the famous Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich. In Belarus, he faces the death penalty. Belarus has 
seized a plane,put passengers in danger, in order to repress an opponent May 23rd 2021 8,450 Retweets15,554 
Likes[3] There is doubt about the Belorussian version of the story, however. Minsk was not the nearest airport when 
the diversion took place. It would have been faster and simpler to land at Vilnius, the planned destination, than to 
divert to Minsk, as the flight map below shows. Catherine Olier @CatherineOlierToday, #Belarus ordered the forced 
landing of a commercial plane to arrest the journalist Raman Pratasevich. Let's not pretend it was an emergency 
landing nor the nearest airport(Vilnius was much closer), it's kidnapping and a major blow to press freedom. 
#FreeRamanPratasevich May 23rd 2021 14 Retweets38 Likes[4] Witnesses on the plane toldDW.com [5]that 
Pratasevich became visibly upset when the airplane turned toward Minsk and told other passengers that 'the death 
penalty' awaited him in Belorus. On the ground in Minsk, soldiers deplaned the passengers and dog teams checked 
the baggage. Pratasevich's luggage was opened and thecontents were thrown onto the pavement[6]. The journalist 
was then arrested and taken away by soldiers. Photos on Twitter show black-uniformed soldiers leading 
Belorussian Air Piracy Must Not Go Unanswered
Pratasevich away. Franak Viačorka @franakviacorkaRaman Pratasevich is a Belarusian journalist and @belamova 
editor. He actively covered the events of the 2020 election campaign and the subsequent protests. Belarusian 
security forces started several criminal cases against him, the KGB put him on the terrorist list. May 23rd 2021 
1,056 Retweets2,618 Likes[7] Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, a former Soviet republic in eastern 
Europe, has been in office since 1994. Since he took office, Lukashenko has extended the presidential term and 
delayed elections. The last candidate to oppose Lukashenko is in exile in Lithuania. As a founding member of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Belorus has close relations with Putin's Russia.; 
Intercepting an international airline flight to arrest a political opponent is unprecedented as far as I can tell. The only 
incident that I can recall that is remotely similar was in 1985 whenUS Navy F-14 Tomcats intercepted an Egyptair 
737[8]that was carrying four terrorists who had hijacked theAchille Laurocruise ship and killed an American citizen, 
Leon Klinghoffer. Mohammed Abbas, a Palestine Liberation Front member, and several PLO officials were also on 
the plane. The Navy fighters forced the airliner down at a NATO airbase in Sicily and turned the terrorists over to 
Italian authorities. 
Lukashenko's actions are violations of international law and the ChicagoConvention on International Civil 
Aviation[9]which guarantees the right to overfly countries without landing. Forcing down an airliner with a jet fighter 
to arrest a passenger is a naked act of air piracy and kidnapping. 
If Lukashenko's actions are allowed to go unchallenged, it might very well be the end of international air travel as 
we know it as theSaudi murder of Jamal Khashoggi[10]may have inspired Lukashenko. If one dictator can pull off 
such a brazen act, others will certainly try. Passengers with political enemies would have to consider how close 
their flights would be to countries where they were persona non grata. Airlines might have to screen passenger 
manifests for controversial passengers that could provoke an interception. Ultimately, attempts to intercept and 
divert airliners could lead to shooting on either small or large scales. 
Although the United States is not directly involved in the incident, both political parties seem to be united in 
opposition to Lukashenko's shocking action. Julie Fisher, President Biden's new ambassador to Belorus called the 
interception 'dangerous and abhorrent' in atweet[11]. Julie Fisher @USAmbBelarusLukashenka and his regime 
today showed again its contempt for international community and its citizens. Faking a bomb threat and sending 
MiG-29s to force @Ryanair to Minsk in order to arrest a @nexta journalist on politically motivated charges is 
dangerous and abhorrent. May 23rd 2021 598 Retweets1,685 Likes[12] Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), the senior 
Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called the act 'an egregious affront to democratic societies' 
and said that Lukashenko 'cannot go unpunished.' House Foreign Affairs GOP @HouseForeignGOP"To force an 
Irish aircraft with nearly 200 innocent civilians to land in order to make that arrest is an egregious affront to 
democratic societies around the world. The Belarusian dictator and those who continue to support him cannot go 
unpunished. May 23rd 2021 12 Retweets24 Likes[13] What the West can do to punish Lukashenko is the question. 
Sanctions are an obvious answer, but may be of limited use since most of Belarus's trade is with Russia. This is 
especially true since the US, Canada, and Europe have alreadytargeted the country and many of its officials with 
sanctions and asset freezes[14]in retaliation for the regime rigging an election last year. The good news is most 
countries that aren't Russia are lining up to demand an explanation from Lukashenko. 
Whatever happens in the coming days, the world should hold Lukashenko responsible for the safety of Raman 
Pratasevich. If the journalist is not released unharmed, Lukashenko and Belarus should be isolated and 
impoverished. Doing so may require further isolating Russia as well. 
In the US, we take many things for granted. Safe air travel and freedom from arrest for political reasons are two big 
ones. It's difficult for most of us to fully comprehend how a flight of an hour or two across Europe, Asia, or Africa 
can cross a number of dictatorial regimes and even run the risk of being shot down likeMalaysia Airlines Flight 
17[15]in 2014. We complain about the other party, but in reality, we know we don't have to worry about being 
arrested, tortured, and murdered for our political views. 
Alexander Lukashenko's decision to risk the lives of almost 200 Ryanair passengers and crew to arrest a political 
opponent is a reminder that there are still very bad and dangerous people in the world who will push the boundaries 
of international law to the brink of war in order to ensure the survival of their regime. Sometimes a backwater 
dictator's actions are so blatant and dangerous that they cannot be ignored by the world. 
This is one of those times.

May 24, 2021( Nieman Journalism Lab: http://www.niemanlab.org/ Delivered by Newstex) ; 
 One consequence of the internet's aversion to international borders has been a recognition that one nation's laws 
restricting basic freedoms can have global effects. When China blocks an American social network, it is restricting 
both what its citizens hear from elsewhere and what the rest of the world hears from Chinese citizens. When Egypt 
tried to turn off the Internet[1] during the Arab Spring, it limited the flow of information but also helped make the 
country's citizens an international cause clbre. When the Indian government orders Twitter to remove a few 
tweets[2] critical of its Covid response, it also makes those 280 characters into[3] a[4] global[5] story[6]. 
 But long before the internet, there was another shared-but-contested space beset by conflicting interests: the air 
itself. Like the Moon[7], the oceans[8], and Antarctica[9], the airspace above us all[10] is both national and 
universal, our birthright as humans and a militarized, commercialized arena for the powerful. And it was that old 
shared space that prompted a significant threat to press freedom this weekend. 
 On Sunday, the autocratic president of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko, ordered a fighter jet to intercept a Ryanair 
passenger plane[11] flying in Belarusian airspace and force it to land at the capital, Minsk. The commercial flight, 
originally a nonstop from Athens to Vilnius, was carrying a journalist and dissident named Roman Protasevich[12], 
26, whose criticism of the Belarusian government was a burr in its saddle. Once grounded, Protasevich was 
removed from the plane and jailed; he could now face the death penalty under Lukashenko's dictatorship. 
 Belarus banned most non-Lukashenko-supporting media outlets last fall amid protests, but Protasevich's online 
platforms — he co-founded the NEXTA channel[13] on Telegram that's become a hub for regime opponents — 
remained a target. (Here's a piece[14] on the channel — 'the most popular dissident media outlet in Belarus' — 
from Rest of World last fall.) 
 The western world has thus far been united in its opposition[15], with several countries ordering their airlines to 
avoid Belarus airspace and some blocking Belarusian flights from landing in their countries. Greek's foreign ministry 
called it a 'state hijacking[16].' 
 Airspace issues such as this one are governed by the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation[17], and 
the agency that oversees such matters believes the forced landing may have violated it. 
A 'state hijacking' in Belarus shows how far its autocratic regime will go to stop dissident journalists
ICAO is strongly concerned by the apparent forced landing of a Ryanair flight and its passengers, which could be in 
contravention of the Chicago Convention. We look forward to more information being officially confirmed by the 
countries and operators concerned. 
 — ICAO (@icao) May 23, 2021[18] 
 The convention seems to give countries somewhat greater leeway[19] in their actions in their airspace when there 
is a threat to 'public safety,' including requiring an aircraft 'to effect a landing as soon as practicablewithin its 
territory.' That quest for wiggle room may be why Belarusian officials used a ginned-up bomb threat as their excuse 
to bring down the plane. 
 But it's possible the Streisand Effect[20] also applies to the atmosphere, not just the blogosphere: Lukashenko's 
attempt to silence a voice has instead driven more attention to it. Belarus is currently prominent on the homepages 
of The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Guardian, El Pais, Le Monde, the BBC, and a host of other 
outlets that are typically happy to let Belorusian headlines drift quietly into the archives. Sanctions are being 
imposed[21] or planned[22]. 
 Time will tell whether Belarus' dictator finds this, in the end, to have been a bee's nest worth disturbing. In the 
meantime, though, a new tactic has just been laid out for autocratic regimes looking to stifle dissent or target 
journalists. In a shared space like the air — or the internet — freedom is hardly guaranteed to win out, no matter 
how idealistic its conventions.

May 24, 2021( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Belarus on Sunday diverted a Ryanair plane and arrested a journalist who was onboard. Roman Protasevich, 26, 
fled to Poland in 2019 and is accused of terrorism in Belarus. Ryanair's CEO said Monday that Belarusian KGB 
agents were on the plane during the forced landing. See more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
Belarusian KGB agents were onboard the Ryanair plane that was abruptly diverted so a dissident journalist could 
be arrested, the airline's CEO said Monday. 
On Sunday, Belarus forced a Ryanair plane that was flying from Athens, Greece, to Vilnius, Lithuania[2], to land in 
Minsk after local air traffic control informed the pilots of a potential bomb threat. 
Once on the ground, authorities found no security threat on board, but Belarusian police entered the plane and 
arrested a passenger, the 26-year-old journalist Roman Protasevich. 
Protasevich is one of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's most vocal critics. He had been living in Poland 
since 2019 over fears for his safety, and has continued to criticize Lukashenko from afar. 
Lukashenko personally deployed a MiG-29 fighter jet to escort the plane to Minsk, according to his office[3].  
Appearing on Ireland's Newstalk Breakfast on Monday[4], Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary called the grounding "a 
case of state-sponsored hijacking" in which "the intent of the authorities was to remove a journalist." 
O'Leary went on to say that he believed that agents from the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus, 
known as the KGB, were onboard the plane when it took off from Athens. 
"We believe there were some KGB agents offloaded at the airport [in Minsk] as well," he said. 
Ryanair did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. 
World leaders have slammed Lukashenko for what they say is a brazen kidnapping attempt and human-rights 
violation. 
Secretary of State Anthony Blinken tweeted[5] Sunday that the US condemned the "brazen and shocking act" and 
Charles Michel, president of the European Council, said Sunday[6] that "the incident will not remain without 
consequences." 
In contrast to O'Leary's comments on Monday, Ryanair's initial statement on the grounding, issued on Sunday, 
made no mention of the bogus security threat or Protasevich's arrest. -Ryanair Press Office (@RyanairPress) May 
Belarus had KGB agents on the passenger plane that was diverted to arrest a dissident journalist, Ryanair CEO 
says
23, 2021[7] Insider has contacted Ryanair for comment. 'Europe's last dictator' Lukashenko has been in power in 
Belarus since 1994, and was recently accused of manipulating the results of last year's election[8] in his favor. He 
has long been called "Europe's Last Dictator." 
His office said[9] at the time that he had won just over 80% of the vote, but EU foreign minister Josep Borrell 
said[10] the election was "neither free nor fair."  
Since the election, Lukashenko's administration has cracked down on opposition[11], limited access to the 
internet[12], shut down independent media outlets, and jailed activists. 
Belarus has accused Protasevich, who had in the past edited the popular Telegram channels Nexta and Nexta Live, 
of terrorism and provoking riots. 
Last November, the country charged him with inciting public disorder and social hatred, which if convicted could 
lead to 12 years in prison, The New York Times reported[13]. 
After the plane was diverted to Minsk on Sunday, Protasevich told fellow passengers that he was "facing the death 
penalty," Lithuanian news site Delfi News reported[14]. 
The Belarusian KGB has included Protasevich on a list of terrorists, The Times reported. If he is convicted of 
terrorism, he could face the death penalty. Read the original article on Business Insider[15]

 The EU moved to isolate Belarus after the government diverted a flight to arrest a journalist. Roman Protasevich 
was on the Ryanair flight when it landed in Minsk due to a bogus security threat. The bloc ordered EU-based 
airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace and banned Belarusian airlines from its airspace and airports. See more 
stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
The European Union moved to isolate Belarus in light of the arrest of a journalist who was arrested after the 
government diverted a Ryanair flight on Sunday. 
The EU ordered all EU-based airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace and banned Belarusian airlines from entering 
EU airspace and landing in its airports. The move was announced Monday during a summit of European Union 
leaders in Brussels. 
Journalist Roman Protasevich[2] was taken into custody after the Lithuania-bound flight he was aboard was 
grounded in Minsk due to a bogus security threat[3]. Protasevich is a vocal critic of Belarusian President Alexander 
Lukashenko, who gave an "unequivocal order" to ground the Ryanair jet in Minsk, according to state media. 
Protasevich's arrest drew international outrage[4] as EU leaders condemned the forced grounding of the flight and 
called for the "immediate release" of Protasevich and his partner, Sofia Sapega[5], who was also escorted off the 
flight. World leaders also demanded "their freedom of movement be guaranteed."

Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Union's European Commission, said the "outrageous and illegal 
behavior of the regime in Belarus will have consequences." 
"Those responsible for the Ryanair hijacking must be sanctioned," von der Leyen said in a statement[7] on Twitter. 
"Journalist Roman Protasevich must be released immediately." 
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki also called the incident an "unprecedented act of state terrorism." 
"Hijacking of a civilian plane is an unprecedented act of state terrorism. It cannot go unpunished," Morawiecki said 
in a statement[8], adding that he would petition[9] for sanctions against Belarus in light of Protasevich's arrest. 
At the Brussels summit, Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg, described the incident as "madness," 
according to a report by The New York Times[10]. 
"It's like something out of a very bad movie," Bettel said. "It shows the state of the regime." 
The EU moves to isolate Belarus after the government diverted a flight carrying a Belarusian dissident
EU officials said few raised objections to the move to avoid Belarusian airspace - a rare occurrence as the bloc 
does not tend to come to a consensus on controversial issues so quickly and easily, The Times reported. Read the

Belarus : EU calls for international probe into forced landing of Ryanair plane

 The EU urged a probe after a Ryanair passenger jet was forced to land in Minsk — in an apparent bid to arrest an 
activist blogger on board. EU leaders are set to discuss additional sanctions against Belarus.Top EU diplomat 
Josep Borrell on Monday called for an international investigation after Belarus forced a Ryanair passenger jet to 
land in Minsk, in an apparent effort to arrest an activist journalist. 
"In carrying out this coercive act, the Belarusian authorities have jeopardized the safety of passengers and crew," 
Borrell said in a statement issued on Monday. 
"An international investigation into this incident must be carried out to ascertain any breach of international aviation 
rules," the statement went on. 
The Belarusian Transport Ministry on Monday announced it had set up a commission to carry out its own 
investigation into the forced landing and would publish the results soon, according to a report by the Russian RIA 
news agency. 
EU to discuss incident at summit 
The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, said EU leaders will discuss the incident at an EU summit 
beginning on Monday, adding that the affair would not remain "without consequences." 
He called on the Belarusian authorities to immediately release the detained passenger. 
An EU spokesman said the leaders would discuss "possible sanctions" on Belarus. High-level officials in the 
country have already been sanctioned by the bloc over the brutal repression of the opposition, protesters and 
journalists following disputed elections in August 2020.  
What happened? 
On Sunday, a Ryanair jet flying from Athens to Lithuania was intercepted by a Belarusian fighter jet and diverted to 
Minsk International Airport after being told a bomb was on board. 
No explosives were found on the aircraft, but Raman Pratasevich, a former editor from the Minsk-critical Telegraph 
outlet Nexta, was allegedly taken into custody. Pratasevich is a known critic of Belarus' long-time leader Alexander 
Lukashenko and his government. 
After hours of delays, the plane was later allowed to fly on to Lithuania — but at least four people, including 
Pratasevich's girlfriend, did not reboard the plane. 
What does Ryanair say? 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told Irish radio station Newstalk that the forced landing "was a case of state-
sponsored hijacking ... state-sponsored piracy" carried out to detain a dissident journalist.

O'Leary said his company believed that some Belarusian secret service agents had been on the plane as well. 
Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney echoed O'Leary's remarks, calling the incident "aviation piracy, state-
sponsored." 
He told state broadcaster RTE that sanctions on Belarus with a "real edge" were needed in response.  
The low-cost airline Ryanair is headquartered in the Irish capital, Dublin.

 Belarus moved first, expelling all staff at Latvia's embassy in protest at opposition flags being hoisted at an ice 
hockey tournament. Minsk is currently the focus of outrage over its forced landing of a passenger jet.Belarusian 
Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei on Monday said the entire Latvian embassy in Minsk had been asked to leave the 
country by midweek. 
The decision was in response to Latvian authorities raising Belarusian opposition flags at an ice hockey 
championship. 
The Latvian officials apparently hoisted the flags in a show of solidarity amid international outrage over Belarus' 
forced landing of a passenger jet on Sunday. 
'Insulting the national flag' 
Makei said Belarus was expelling the entire staff of Latvia's embassy, including the ambassador. 
The minister said Latvia's ambassador, Einars Semanis, had been summoned to the foreign ministry on Monday 
and given 24 hours to leave. 
According the state-run news agency Belta, Makei said the summons was for "insulting the national flag." 
"A strong protest was expressed to the ambassador in connection with the situation," Belta quoted Makei as saying. 
The rest of the embassy staff were given 48 hours to leave, with one member of the administrative staff allowed to 
remain to look after the building. 
Latvia responded soon afterward with the reciprocal expulsions of Belarusian diplomats. 
One nation, two sets of colors 
The switch of flags took place at the 2021 Ice Hockey World Championship, which Belarus had been due to cohost. 
Belarus was excluded from its role in the tournament over "security concerns," and Riga was named the sole host. 
The organizers raised the opposition's red-and-white flag — a symbol of the short-lived Belarusian National 
Republic in 1918 that has become a rallying point for opponents of Lukashenko. The flag was readopted in 1991 
when Belarus won independence from Moscow, but done away with in 1994 when Lukashenko came to power. 
Belarus' current official red-green flag includes and embroidered pattern and dates back to 1951, when the country 
was still part of the Soviet Union. 
International outrage over forced landing 
The change of flags came as Belarus came under fire from European leaders for forcing a Ryanair passenger flight 
from Greece to the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, to land in Minsk on Sunday. 
Belarus and Latvia expel diplomats in ice hockey flag furor
Belarusian officials then swooped on the plane to detain blogger journalist and opposition activist Raman 
Pratasevich. 
The arrest was the boldest in a series of moves by Lukashenko's government to crack down on opposition figures 
and members of the press. 
The campaign targeting opposition and independent media follows mass protests against Lukashenko. The 
longtime leader was re-elected for a sixth term in a disputed election in August 2020. 
More than 34,000 people have been arrested in Belarus since August, with thousands of protesters beaten by 
security forces.

 Belarus shared video of a journalist detained after the government hijacked a passenger flight. KGB agents 
arrested Roman Protasevich, a critic of President Alexander Lukashenko, Monday. Protasevich said authorities 
treated him "correctly" and "lawfully" as he was taken into custody. See more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
Belarusian authorities posted a video of the journalist arrested Monday after the government hijacked a flight. 
A passenger plane en route from Athens to Lithuania landed in Minsk, Belarus, after air-traffic operators were 
warned of a bogus security threat. Pilots on flight FR4978 were ordered to "divert to the nearest airport," citing a 
potential bomb threat aboard the plane. 
KGB agents boarded the aircraft soon after and did not find the security threat. They arrested journalist Roman 
Protasevich[2], who has been publicly critical of the Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko's rule. 
Belarusian state media reported it was Lukashenko who gave an "unequivocal order" to ground the jet in Minsk, 
despite data on Flightradar.com[3] showing the plane made a sharp U-turn to land in Belarus, as it was closer to its 
destination in Lithuania than Minsk, Insider's Cheryl Teh[4] reported. 
In the government video reposted by the Minsk-based reporter Hanna Liubakova[5] later Monday, Protasevich 
confirmed he was detained by authorities at Minsk National Airport by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. He said he 
currently has "no health concerns" and said he was treated "correctly" and "lawfully" when taken into custody. 
Protasevich said he was cooperating with authorities and continues to "provide evidence related to the mass rallies 
in Minsk," according to a translation by Insider. -Hanna Liubakova (@HannaLiubakova) May 24, 2021[6] However, 
eyewitnesses said Protasevich expressed fear and told other passengers on the plane he was "facing the death 
penalty" as state authorities hijacked the plane to take him into custody, passenger Monika Simkiene told AFP[7] 
reporter Katy Lee. 
"He was not screaming, but it was clear that he was very much afraid. It looked like if the window had been open, 
he would have jumped out of it," passenger Edvinas Dimsa told Lee. 
Protasevich's arrest drew international outrage, including from Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Union's 
executive European Commission, who said the "outrageous and illegal behavior of the regime in Belarus will have 
consequences."

"Those responsible for the Ryanair hijacking must be sanctioned," von der Leyen said in a statement[8] on Twitter. 
"Journalist Roman Protasevich must be released immediately." 
Poland Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki also called the incident an "unprecedented act of state terrorism." 
"Hijacking of a civilian plane is an unprecedented act of state terrorism. It cannot go unpunished,"Morawiecki said in 
a statement[9], adding that he would petition[10] for sanctions against Belarus in light of Protasevich's arrest.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The authoritarian president of Belarus on Monday signed a law sharply restricting news 
media activities and allowing them to be shut down without a court hearing.  
 The move by President Alexander Lukashenko came a day after the arrest of a prominent opposition journalist 
whose commercial flight was forcibly diverted to Belarus because of an alleged bomb threat. The arrest and flight 
diversion was condemned by Western countries and drew new attention to Belarus' crackdown on media since 
widespread protests against Lukashenko arose last year. 
 Under the new law, news media are banned from making live reports on unauthorized mass gatherings. It also 
allows the Information Ministry to order a media outlet's closure; previously media closures required a court 
decision. 
 Other strictures include prohibiting publication of the results of opinion polls that aren't authorized by the 
government.  
 'This is the most repressive media law in Europe, which turns the work of journalists in Belarus into a minefield," 
said Andrei Bastunets, president of the Belarusian Association of Journalists. 
 Widespread protests rocked Belarus for weeks last year, following an allegedly fraudulent election that gave 
Lukashenko a sixth term in office. More than 30,000 people were arrested in the protests, many of them beaten by 
police.  
 The country has steadily cracked down on journalists, including blocking several major news websites and 
declaring opposition-minded messaging app channels to be extremist.

7 Retailers That Are Bucking the E-Commerce Trend[2] Once again it appears that the death of brick and mortar 
retail appears to be exaggerated. First-quarter earnings are showing that many retailers that rely on in-person traffic 
for a considerable chunk of their business are seeing a rebound in sales. And many are planning to open stores in 
2021. 
 This isn't to say that e-commerce is going away. In fact, a common feature for many of these stocks is that they 
either developed or enhanced their digital footprint during the pandemic. 
 This special presentation focuses on retailers that are planning to add to their brick-and-mortar footprint in 2021. 
And some are planning to do so by a substantial margin. Once again, this doesn't signal a transformative shift in the

 European leaders are vowing to punish Belarus for illegally diverting to Minsk Sunday a Lithuanian-bound Ryanair 
flight carrying a fugitive critic of Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko. 
Their fury was fueled as more details emerged Monday of the dramatic events leading up to the diversion of the 
plane. The Ryanair Boeing 737 was carrying 171 passengers and crew had taken off from Athens and was flying 
over Belarus. It was just moments from leaving Belarusian air space when the captain was signaled by the pilot of a 
Belarus MiG-29 jet to land in the Belarus capital and not to proceed to the scheduled destination, Vilnius, 
Lithuania's capital.

Belarus authorities, after it landed at Vilnius Airport, May 23, 2021. When the plane landed in Minsk, Belarusian 
security service officers detained 26-year-old opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich, who could face a death 
sentence on charges of helping to organize protests against President Lukashenko. Just before the aircraft landed, 
he gave his laptop and cell phone to a friend for safekeeping, passengers told reporters in Vilnius.  
Pratasevich's girlfriend, Sofia, was also detained. And reports emerged Monday of another detainee.  
The plan to seize Pratasevich, who has lived in exile since 2019, also appears to have involved the participation of 
Belarusian KGB agents, who were present at the departure airport at Athens and boarded the jet, according to 
opposition activists.

Opposition blogger and activist Raman Pratasevich, who is accused of participating in an unsanctioned protest at 
the Kuropaty preserve, arrives for a court hearing in Minsk, Belarus, Apr. 10, 2017. The Greek Foreign Ministry 
EU Fury Mounts After Belarus Forces Plane Carrying Fugitive Journalist to Land
released a statement Sunday describing the forced landing as a 'state hijacking' which 'put the lives of all the 
passengers on board in danger.' That view was echoed by US. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who dubbed the 
illegal diversion in a statement as 'a shocking act.'  
Blinken said the 'regime endangered the lives of more than 120 passengers, including US citizens. Initial reports 
suggesting the involvement of the Belarusian security services and the use of Belarusian military aircraft to escort 
the plane are deeply concerning and require full investigation,' he added.  
Fight onboard 
In an online post before leaving Athens, Pratasevich said he was being trailed by KGB agents. 'This was some 
suspicious crap,' he wrote. 'When the plane entered Belarus airspace KGB officers initiated a fight with the Ryanair 
crew, insisting that there was an improvised explosive device onboard,' Tadeusz Giczan, an editor at the activist 
Telegram site Nexta, tweeted.  
'Eventually the crew was forced to send out an SOS, literally moments before the plane would have left Belarusian 
airspace. A MiG-29 took off and escorted it to Minsk,' he said. There were also local reports that an Mi-24 helicopter 
gunship was used in the operation. 
Ryanair said in a statement that the crew was also told by Belarus aviation authorities of a 'potential security threat 
on board' and ordered the plane to Minsk, even though Vilnius was nearer. On landing, all the passengers were 
searched and the flight was allowed to resume its journey five hours later. 
Rynair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, also said he believes that Belarus KGB agents were on board the flight. In an 
interview Monday with a British radio broadcaster, he said: 'It appears the intent of the authorities was to remove a 
journalist and his traveling companion. We believe there were some KGB agents offloaded at the airport as well.' 
On Monday, it also emerged that along with Pratasevich and his girlfriend, a Russian citizen studying at the 
European Humanities University, EHU, in Lithuania, was forced off the flight, too. EHU has demanded her release, 
saying she was detained by the Minsk Investigative Committee on 'groundless and made-up conditions.'  
EU response 
EU leaders will discuss the case at a summit Monday, European Council President Charles Michel. 'The incident 
will not remain without consequences,' he added in a statement.  
'Possible sanctions' would be on the table, his spokesperson said. They could include barring Belarusian airlines 
from over-flying EU states or landing at the bloc's airports and suspending all flights of EU airlines through 
Belarusian airspace. Ground transit from Belarus into the EU could also be prohibited, say EU officials.

condemned as rigged and sparked huge protests across Belarus, the EU has imposed a series of sanctions on the 
country. 
Lithuanian prosecutors say they are launching a criminal investigation into the hijacking and are considering filing 
terrorism charges. Lithuania's prime minister told reporters that the prosecutors interviewed passengers and crew 
on their arrival in Vilnius. 'The unprecedented situation will have to be investigated very thoroughly,' Ingrida 
Simonyte said.

Belarus public broadcasters said security officials only discovered Pratasevich was on the flight after his girlfriend

switched to another opposition messaging app recently, was in Athens to cover a visit to Greece by Belarus 
opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya.

Pratasevich,' she said. 'Not a single person who flies over Belarus can be sure of his safety,' she added in a 
statement. 
Of the 171 people who boarded in Athens, only 165 landed in Vilnius, according to Lithuanian authorities. 
Pratasevich, his girlfriend and the EHU students account for three of the six who did not proceed to Vilnius.  
The other three are likely Belarus KGB agents, say Lithuanian officials, but there are also local reports that at least 
two were Russians, prompting speculation in the Belarus opposition media that they may have been Russian 
intelligence officers.

 The forced landing of a Ryanair plane in Minsk has resulted in the imprisonment of a dissident journalist. The 
president has raised the stakes on reporting in Belarus, a colleague of the arrested journalist writes.On Sunday, 
authorities in Belarus forced a Ryanair plane to land in the capital, Minsk, citing a bomb threat. When it became 
clear that the aircraft was being diverted, one passenger's reaction stood out.  
A young man grabbed his head in panic. Once the plane landed, passengers left the plane and their belongings 
were checked. Security forces approached the man. He felt calmer but was still trembling. Shortly before they took 
him away in an unknown direction, he told people who were around: "A death penalty awaits me here." 
It was Raman Pratasevich, a 26-year-old Belarusian blogger and journalist. He knew that his unexpected visit to 
Belarus meant a certain arrest, because he is on a terrorist watch list drawn up by the State Security Committee, 
still known as the KGB. 
'Potential security threat' 
Pratasevich was on his way back from Athens to Vilnius, Lithuania, where he is based. Belarusian President 
Alexander Lukashenko personally ordered a MiG-29 jet fighter to escort the civilian plane to the Minsk airport. In a 
statement, Ryanair said the crew had been "notified by Belarus Air Traffic Control of a potential security threat on 
board and were instructed to divert to the nearest airport, Minsk." 
The journalist had left Belarus for Poland in 2019 in fear of arrest. From there, he worked as the editor-in-chief of 
the influential Telegram channels Nexta and Nexta Live, which became the main source of information about 
protests when the internet was shut down after the disputed presidential election in August. 
Since November, Pratasevich — like Nexta founder Stsiapan Putsila — has been on the government's list of more 
than 700 "individuals involved in terrorist activities." 
Lukashenko targets press 
With most opposition leaders having left Belarus, Nexta has played a key role in spreading information, posting 
updates, giving the time and location of rallies, and revealing facts about police brutality. Lukashenko, who has 
ruled Belarus since 1994, has accused social media and independent journalists of being responsible for organizing 
and coordinating mass opposition rallies. 
When asked if he was afraid that Lukashenko's agents might get to him in Poland, Pratasevich said he was in the 
process of obtaining refugee status and would not be deported. A request for Raman's extradition had previously 
been sent by the Belarusian authorities to Poland's government, which did not comply. 
Why Lukashenko diverted a plane to catch Belarusian blogger
Four prominent activists who are members of the Polish minority in Belarus were arrested — including the 
community leaders Andzelika Borys and Andrzej Poczobut. They were charged with breaching rules on mass 
gatherings during an annual folk fair, as well as inciting national and religious hatred, a charge punishable with a 
prison sentence of up to 12 years. The arrests have been accompanied by anti-Polish propaganda on state TV. 
The regime launched a war on journalists and bloggers in Belarus months before last summer's election. In June, 
Ihar Losik, a consultant for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) and the founder of another influential 
Telegram channel, Belarus of the Brain, was detained. Since then, the already dire situation has worsened. 
Raid on tut.by 
On May 18, security services raided the offices of tut.by, the largest media outlet in Belarus, as well as apartments 
of the website's journalists. The portal's editor-in-chief, Maryna Zolatava, and other journalists were arrested. 
For over 20 years, tut.by has been popular among Belarusians, no matter their political views. Lukashenko's 
officials read tut.by, and so did his opponents. The website's reach set a record high in May — right before it was 
blocked — with its monthly unique users hitting 3.3 million, or 63% of Belarusian internet users.  
Dozens of independent news portals have already been blocked, hundreds of journalists were arrested or detained, 
and a number of newspapers have stopped being printed. But this was not enough. Lukashenko has continually 
raised the stakes of reporting in Belarus. 
Pratasevich's trumped-up charges 
Pratasevich is facing charges on at least three criminal counts. One of them is on "plotting mass riots," which is 
punishable by up to 15 years in prison. There haven't been any accusations yet publicly made related to the 
allegations of his "terrorist' activities. But, as he is most probably being held in the KGB prison in Minsk, a lawyer 
was not allowed to see him. There is practically no information as to his health and the conditions in which he is 
being held. 
At the time of his arrest, Pratasevich was working for Losik's Belarus of the Brain. Both are my friends. Although 
they have different personalities — Ihar is a quiet introvert while Raman is a loud extrovert — they share many 
similarities. Both were on the radar of Belarusian law enforcement since at least 2011, when they were involved in 
the so-called Revolution Through Social Networks in Minsk and other cities. Both were awarded a Vaclav Havel 
Journalism Fellowship at RFE/RL. Both are now jailed. 
Bloggers became the first target for Lukashenko, who wants to silence the dissent. He must believe that it is 
technology — not his rule, human rights violations and the widespread poverty in Belarus — that brought people to 
the streets. So far, he has fought his opponents within Belarus. On Sunday, he proved that there are no bounds for 
his repressions.

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — A prominent opponent of Belarus' authoritarian president was arrested Sunday after the 
airliner in which he was traveling was diverted to the country after a bomb threat, in what the opposition and 
Western officials denounced as a hijacking operation by the government.
Raman Pratasevich, who faces charges that could bring 15 years in prison, was aboard the Ryanair flight from 
Athens, Greece, to the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius when it changed course to head for Minsk.
“I saw this Belarusian guy with girlfriend sitting right behind us. He freaked out when the pilot said the plane is 
diverted to Minsk. He said there’s death penalty awaiting him there," passenger Marius Rutkauskas said after the 
plane arrived in Vilnius following several hours in the Belarusian capital.
"We sat for an hour after the landing. Then they started releasing passengers and took those two. We did not see 
them again” Rutkauskas said.
Flight tracker sites indicated the plane was about 10 kilometers (six miles) from the Lithuanian border when it was 
diverted. There were conflicting accounts of the move.
The press service of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said the president himself ordered that a MiG-29 
fighter jet accompany the airliner after he was informed of the bomb threat. Deputy air force commander Andrei 
Gurtsevich said the plane's crew made the decision to land in Minsk.
But Ryanair said in a statement that Belarusian air traffic control instructed the plane to divert to the capital.
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda called the incident a “state-sponsored terror act.” He said that the European 
Council would discuss the case Monday and that he would propose banning Belarusian planes from European 
Union airports and “serious sanctions” against Lukashenko's government.
“Belarusian airspace is completely unsafe for any commercial flight, and it should be deemed this not only by the 
EU but by the international community. Because now, this instrument could be used for any plane crossing 
Belarusian airspace,” said Lithuania's foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis..
Belarus opposition figure detained when flight diverted
Pratasevich is a co-founder of the Telegram messaging app’s Nexta channel, which Belarus last year declared as 
extremist after it was used to help organize major protests against Lukashenko. The protests have dwindled in 
recent months, but Belarus authorities are continuing to crack down on opposition with arrests.
The Belarus presidential press service said the bomb threat was received while the plane was over Belarusian 
territory. Officials later said no explosives were found on board.
Passengers were taken off the plane in Minsk. After the plane arrived in Vilnius, Defense Minister Arvydas 
Anusauskas said Pratasevich's girlfriend and four other people did not reboard.
“We will find out who are the other four that did not travel with the rest. Lithuania has launched an investigation to 
find out what really happened on that plane,” he said on Facebook.
Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya called on the International Civil Aviation Organization to begin 
an investigation.
“It is absolutely obvious that this is an operation by the special services to hijack an aircraft in order to detain activist 
and blogger Raman Pratasevich,” she said in a statement. “Not a single person who flies over Belarus can be sure 
of his safety.”
The ICAO later said it “is strongly concerned by the apparent forced landing.”
Belarusian authorities said there were 123 passengers on the plane. But Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign 
minister, said there were 171.
Western countries also expressed alarm.
Belarus “showed again its contempt for international community and its citizens,” U.S. Ambassador Julie Fisher 
said, calling the event “dangerous and abhorrent.”
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted: “It is utterly unacceptable to force @Ryanair flight 
from Athens to Vilnius to land in Minsk.”
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that "such an act cannot be left without definite consequences from the 
side of the European Union” and called for Pratasevich to be released.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the incident “shocking” and accused Lukashenka’s government of 
endangering the lives of those aboard the aircraft, some of them Americans. He called for the release of 
Pratasevich and for the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization to review the incident.
“Independent media are an essential pillar supporting the rule of law and a vital component of a democratic society. 
The United States once again condemns the Lukashenka regime’s ongoing harassment and arbitrary detention of 
journalists,” Blinken said.
Months of protests erupted in Belarus after last August's presidential election that official results said gave 
Lukashenko a sixth term in office.
Police cracked down on the protests harshly, detaining around 30,000 people and beating many of them.
Although protests died down during the winter, Belarus has continued to take actions against the opposition and 
independent news media. Last week, 11 staff members of the TUT.by news website were detained by police.

May 23, 2021( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Belarusian opposition Telegram channel Nexta said Sunday its former editor and exiled opposition activist Roman 
Protasevich had been detained in Minsk after his flight made an emergency landing under orders from President 
Alexander Lukashenko. 
The move comes amid an intensifying crackdown following historic demonstrations that gripped the ex-Soviet 
country after a disputed presidential election last year. 
Nexta Live and its sister channel Nexta -- with close to 2 million subscribers on the Telegram messenger -- are 
prominent voices of the Belarus opposition and helped mobilise protesters. 
Belarusians took to the streets demanding the resignation of Lukashenko, who has ruled with an iron fist for over 
two decades and in August secured a landslide victory in an election his opponents say was rigged. 
Protasevich was on Sunday aboard a Ryanair flight from Athens to the Lithuanian capital Vilnius, which made an 
emergency landing following a bomb scare, TASS news agency reported citing the press service of Minsk airport. 
"The plane was checked, no bomb was found and all passengers were sent for another security search," Nexta 
said. "Among them was... Nexta journalist Roman Protasevich. He was detained." 
It added that Protasevich said he was followed before boarding the flight. 
 The Belarusian Interior Ministry initially confirmed the detention on Telegram, but the post was later deleted. 
Last year, 26-year old Protasevich and Nexta founder Stepan Putilo, 22, were added to Belarus's list of "individuals 
involved in terrorist activity". 
The two bloggers -- who live in Poland -- were added to the list based on earlier charges of causing mass unrest, an 
offence that can lead to up to 15 years of imprisonment. 
Belarus had also labelled the Nexta Telegram channels and its logo "extremist" and ordered it blocked.

The Telegram channel of Lukashenko's press service said the president gave the order to turn the flight around. It 
added that he also ordered a Mig-29 fighter jet to accompany the aircraft. 
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda on Twitter called the incident an "unprecedented event" and said that the 
Belarus "regime is behind the abhorrent action". 
"It is absolutely obvious that this is an operation of secret services to capture the plane in order to detain activist 
and blogger Roman Protasevich," exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said on Telegram. 
Exiled Activist Held At Belarus Airport: Opposition
The opposition believes that Tikhanovskaya, who fled to neighbouring Lithuania after the election, was the true 
winner of last year's presidential vote. 
Both Tikhanovskaya and Nexta say that Protasevich could face the death penalty in Belarus. 
A member of the Nexta team, Tadeusz Giczan, said on Twitter that representatives of the Belarusian security 
agency were on the flight with Protasevich. 
"Then when the plane had entered Belarus airspace, the KGB officers initiated a fight with the Ryanair crew 
insisting there's an IED onboard," he said. 
A spokeswoman for state company "Lithuanian airports", Lina Beisine, told AFP that Minsk airport said the flight 
was redirected "due to a conflict between a member of the crew and the passengers". 
There was no immediate reaction from Ryanair. 
The European Union and the United States have sanctioned Lukashenko and dozens of officials and businessmen 
tied to his regime with asset freezes and visa bans. 
The historic Belarus protests, which left at least four people dead, have now subsided, but journalists and activists 
continue to receive prison sentences in the aftermath.

European nations were demanding answers after Belarusian authorities dispatched a fighter jet to force a Ryanair 
flight to divert to Minsk, where a dissident journalist who was on board was then arrested.
Ryanair said its plane was flying from Greece to Lithuania on Sunday when it was notified of "a potential security 
threat on board" by air traffic controllers in Belarus and told to divert to Minsk for an emergency landing.
The airline said the plane landed safely in Belarusian capital and "nothing untoward was found" after passengers 
were offloaded and an inspection took place.
But authorities at the airport used the opportunity to arrest Roman Protasevich, a Belarusian journalist and 
opposition activist, who was a passenger, according to state media and the rights group Viasna.
The opposition news outlet Nexta also confirmed the arrest of Protasevich, the organization's co-founder and 
former editor who has been living in exile. It also said that Protasevich had been followed before he boarded the 
plane in Athens.
Governments across Europe reacted with the outrage, suggesting authoritarian Belarus used the pretext of a safety 
threat to conduct a "state hijacking" of a civilian airliner in order to go after a critic.
Belarusian state media reported that the plane's diversion came on the personal instructions of long-time President 
Alexander Lukashenko after he had purportedly been alerted to a possible bomb on board and was concerned 
about the plane's safety.
He also ordered a MiG-29 fighter jet be scrambled to accompany the Ryanair plane, according to the Belta state

Lukashenko, 66, has led Belarus - a former Soviet republic in Eastern Europe bordering EU states Poland, 
Lithuania and Latvia - for more than a quarter of a century, tolerating little dissent.
Mass protests against his rule erupted after a presidential election last year that was widely seen as unfair and rife 
with electoral fraud.
Belarus calls Nexta an extremist organization and Protasevich has been wanted by authorities. Nexta had urged on 
the protests against Lukashenko.
Lukashenko has long considered Protasevich to be an enemy. The country's KGB secret service had reportedly put 
his name on a list of people accused of alleged terrorism and he faces years in prison if convicted.
Condemnation of Belarus came swiftly on Sunday, with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg calling for an 
international investigation and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen saying the "utterly 
unacceptable" incident "must bear consequences."
The 27 EU leaders will discuss Belarus during a previously scheduled summit in Brussels on Monday, including the 
possibility of imposing sanctions on Minsk, a spokesperson for EU Council President Charles Michel said.
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda tweeted that Belarus had committed an "abhorrent action" and demanded 
the release of Protasevich.
The Greek Foreign Ministry said it "strongly condemns the state hijacking," while the United States, Britain, 
Germany, France, Poland, Austria, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands were among the chorus denouncing 
Minsk.
Ryanair Flight FR4978 was en route from Athens to the Lithuanian capital Vilnius when it was ordered to land in 
Minsk.
Flight monitoring websites, like Flightradar24, showed the plane was nearly out of Belarusian airspace when the 
diversion order was given.
Former Belarusian culture minister Pavel Latushko, who lives in exile in the EU, said, citing his contacts, that the 
flight control centre in Minsk threatened the pilots with shooting down the plane if they did not land.
Greece and Lithuania put the number of passengers on board at 171, although Ryanair has not provided a figure. 
Lithuania said most of the passengers were Lithuanian nationals. Belarus had said the plane had 123 passengers.
The Irish low-cost airline said the plane spent seven hours on the ground in Minsk undergoing security checks 
before it was allowed to depart at 8:50 pm (1750 GMT). It landed in Vilnius a little over 30 minutes later.
Ryanair made no mention of Protasevich in its statement.
Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who many in Belarus consider the true winner of the 
2020 presidential election, urged the international community to punish Lukashenko.
"From now on, no person from any country who flies over Belarus is guaranteed even basic safety. [Lukashenko] 
personally caused an international scandal, used military aircraft against civilians of Belarus and European 
countries - to reprise a single person," she wrote on Twitter.

 Belarus forced a Ryanair flight carrying a wanted opposition activist to Vilnius to divert and land in Minsk on 
Sunday, provoking a furious outcry from European leaders. 
Belarusian state television reported that Roman Protasevich, a 26-year-old opposition blogger exiled in Poland, had 
been detained in the capital after flight FR4978 was diverted -- ostensibly over a security scare. 
Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki denounced the major diplomatic incident as "an act of state terrorism", 
while French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called for a "strong and united response" from the European 
Union. 
The EU is set to discuss toughening its existing sanctions against Belarus -- imposed over the crackdown by the 
regime of President Alexander Lukashenko on opposition protesters -- at a pre-planned summit on Monday.

After hours grounded in Belarus the flight was able to continue on its journey, landing in Vilnius at 1825 GMT, the 
airport's online arrivals board said. 
Officials had yet to confirm whether Protasevich was onboard or had remained in detention in Belarus. 
Minsk's airport had released a statement earlier saying the aircraft had to make an emergency landing there at 
1215 GMT following a bomb scare. 
 "The plane was checked, no bomb was found and all passengers were sent for another security search," said 
Nexta, a Belarus opposition channel on the Telegram messaging app, which Protasevich previously edited.

Lukashenko's press service said on its own Telegram channel that the president had given the order to divert the 
flight and had ordered a Mig-29 fighter jet to accompany the plane. 
The incident comes as Belarus authorities intensify their crackdown on the opposition following historic protests that 
gripped the ex-Soviet country after last year's disputed presidential election.

The diversion of a flight between two EU countries -- Greece and Lithuania -- and the arrest of an opposition activist 
who had been onboard, prompted a torrent of outrage from European leaders. 
EU Outrage As Belarus Diverts Flight, Arrests Opposition Activist
European Council president Charles Michel said he condemned it "in the strongest possible terms" and demanded 
Protasevich's release. 
In Athens, where the flight began, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted: "The forced landing of a commercial 
plane to detain a journalist is an unprecedented, shocking act. 
"We demand all passengers' immediate release," he added, calling for EU action to "step up pressure on Belarus. 
Enough is enough". 
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda described Belarus's actions as "abhorrent", while the French government 
summoned the Belarusian ambassador to Paris, Igor Fissenko, for a dressing-down.

The government in Ireland, where Ryanair is headquartered, described the incident as "absolutely unacceptable", 
while NATO called it "dangerous" and demanded an international investigation. 
Since last August's disputed election, Belarusians have taken to the streets demanding the resignation of 
Lukashenko, who has ruled for over two decades. 
Protasevich and Nexta founder Stepan Putilo, 22, were added to Belarus's list of "individuals involved in terrorist 
activity" last year. 
The two bloggers -- both now based in Poland -- were added to the list over charges of causing mass unrest, an 
offence punishable by up to 15 years in jail. 
Belarus had also labelled the Nexta Telegram channels and its logo "extremist" and ordered them blocked. 
Nexta Live and sister channel Nexta -- with close to two million subscribers on Telegram -- are prominent voices of 
the Belarus opposition and helped mobilise protesters. 
"It is absolutely obvious that this is an operation of secret services to capture the plane in order to detain activist 
and blogger Roman Protasevich," exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said on Telegram. 
The opposition says that Tikhanovskaya, who fled to neighbouring Lithuania after the election, was the true winner 
of last year's presidential vote. 
A member of the Nexta team, Tadeusz Giczan, said on Twitter that representatives of the Belarusian security 
agency had been on the flight with Protasevich. 
"Then when the plane had entered Belarus airspace, the KGB officers initiated a fight with the Ryanair crew 
insisting there's an IED onboard," he said. 
A spokeswoman for state company Lithuanian Airports, Lina Beisine, told AFP that Minsk airport had said the flight 
was redirected "due to a conflict between a member of the crew and the passengers". 
Ryanair said the flight's crew had been notified by Belarus air traffic control of "a potential security threat on board" 
and were instructed to divert to Minsk, the "nearest" airport. 
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said there were 171 passengers aboard the flight, most of them 
Lithuanian nationals. 
The EU and the United States have sanctioned Lukashenko and dozens of officials and businessmen tied to his 
regime with asset freezes and visa bans. 
The opposition protests in Belarus, which left at least four people dead, have now subsided, but journalists and 
activists continue to receive prison sentences in the aftermath.

 Belarus forced an Athens-to-Vilnius Ryanair flight carrying a wanted opposition activist to divert and land in Minsk 
Sunday, provoking an outcry from European leaders and the European Union. 
European leaders reacted furiously after the incident, which led to the arrest of Belarusian opposition activist 
Roman Protasevich, and which Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki denounced as "an act of state 
terrorism". 
Several European leaders called for talks Monday on fresh sanctions against Belarus. 
Earlier Sunday, the opposition Telegram channel Nexta said Protasevich, its former editor, was being held in Minsk 
after his flight had been forced to land on the orders of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. 
A statement from Minsk airport said the aircraft had had to make an emergency landing following a bomb scare.

"The plane was checked, no bomb was found and all passengers were sent for another security search," Nexta 
said. "Among them was... Nexta journalist Roman Protasevich. He was detained." 
The Belarusian interior ministry initially confirmed the detention on Telegram, but the post was later deleted. 
 But the Telegram channel of Lukashenko's press service said the president had given the order to turn the flight 
around. It added that he had also ordered a Mig-29 fighter jet to accompany the aircraft. 
The incident comes as the Belarus authorities intensify their crackdown on the opposition in Belarus following 
historic protests that gripped the ex-Soviet country after a disputed presidential election last year.

The European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell tweeted: "We hold the government of Belarus responsable 
for the security of all passengers and the aircraft. 
"ALL passengers must be able to continue their travel immediately," he said, implicitly demanding the release of 
exiled opposition activist Roman Protasevich. 
Gitanas Nauseda, the president of Lithuania, where the flight was bound, called the incident an "unprecedented 
event" and blamed the Belarus regime for the "abhorrent action". 
In Greece, where the flight started its journey, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted: "The forced landing of a 
commercial plane to detain a journalist is an unprecedented, shocking act.

Belarus' military required a civilian plane flying over its territory to land on Sunday, after which officials arrested a 
blogger wanted by the government and had him taken away, according to Belarusian media.
Roman Protasevich, the blogger, was on a Athens-to-Vilnius flight from Ryanair when a fighter jet intercepted the 
plane's path, at which point the airliner asked permission to land, according to Belarusian media reports.
Other reports said that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had ordered the action after a report of a bomb 
on the plane. There was no immediate comment from Ryanair.
According to Viasna, a Belarusian human rights group, Protasevich was detained after the plane landed. Opposition 
groups said the act was an unparalleled move by Minsk into international airspace.
Nexta, another opposition news channel, and one that was founded by Protasevich, confirmed that he had been 
detained.
Belarus calls Nexta an extremist organization. It had repeatedly called for mass protests against Lukashenko's rule 
after Lukashenko claimed victory in disputed elections in August.
Lukashenko has long considered Protasevich to be an enemy. The country's KGB secret service had put his name 
on a list of people accused of alleged terrorism, according to the tut.by internet portal, in a report released via the 
Telegram messaging app.
Speaking to local media, airport officials confirmed that a fighter jet had intercepted the plane, which then asked for 
permission to land. Furthermore, they said that the bomb scare proved to be a hoax and that the other 123 
passengers on board are waiting at the airport so they can continue their journey.
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda has demanded Protasevich's immediate release.

European nations were demanding answers after Belarusian authorities dispatched a fighter jet to force a Ryanair 
flight with more than 100 passengers to divert to Minsk, where a dissident journalist who was on board was then 
arrested.
Ryanair said its plane was flying from Greece to Lithuania on Sunday when it was notified of "a potential security 
threat on board" by air traffic controllers in Belarus and told to divert to Minsk for an emergency landing.
The airline said the plane landed safely in Belarusian capital and "nothing untoward was found" after an inspection.
But authorities at the airport used the opportunity to arrest Roman Protasevich, a Belarusian journalist and 
opposition activist, who was a passenger, according to state media and the rights group Viasna.
The opposition news outlet Nexta also confirmed the arrest of Protasevich, the organization's co-founder and 
former editor who has been living in exile.
Governments across Europe reacted with the outrage, accusing authoritarian Belarus of engaging in a "state 
hijacking" of a civilian airliner and promising consequences.
Belarusian state media reported that the plane's diversion came on the personal instructions of long-time President 
Alexander Lukashenko after he had purportedly been alerted to a possible bomb on board.
He also ordered a MiG-29 fighter jet be scrambled to accompany the Ryanair plane, according to the Belta state 
news agency.

Lithuania and Latvia - for more than a quarter of a century, tolerating little dissent.

Minsk.

European leaders are demanding answers after a Ryanair flight was diverted to an airport in Belarus on Sunday, 
apparently so authorities in Minsk could detain a blogger who had been travelling from Athens to Vilnius in the 
plane.
The Irish airline Ryanair confirmed the incident. Crew on the plane had been alerted to a possible security threat by 
Belarusian authorities and directed to land at an airport near Minsk, the company said. "Nothing untoward was 
found," it said.
"Ryanair has notified the relevant national and European safety and security agencies and we apologise sincerely 
to all affected passengers for this regrettable delay, which was outside Ryanair's control," read a statement.
According to Belarusian media, Minsk used the opportunity to detain Roman Protasevich, a blogger critical of the 
government who was on the plane.
According to Viasna, a Belarusian human rights group, Protasevich was detained after the plane landed.
Nexta, another opposition news channel, and one that was founded by Protasevich, confirmed that he had been 
detained.

So far, Ryanair says the plane is now expected to continue with its journey at 1600 GMT. But there was no word on 
Protasevich.
Lithuania demanded that Belarus release all passengers and crew. Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said 
there were 171 passengers on the flight and that Lithuania had gathered details on 149 of them. It said most of the 
passengers were Lithuanian nationals, but there were multiple citizens from other EU countries on board.
Condemnation came in quickly from a variety of countries, such as Austria, Germany and Sweden, as well as the 
European Union. There were demands for an investigation.

 Passengers on Ryanair flight FR4978 described the anxious minutes for opposition blogger Roman Protasevich 
after he realised that the plane was being diverted to Minsk, where he was later detained. 
"He started panicking and saying this was because of him," Monika Simkiene, a 40-year-old Lithuanian, told AFP 
after the plane finally landed in Vilnius several hours later than its scheduled arrival time. 
"He just turned to people and said he was facing the death penalty," she said, adding that once Protasevich 
understood that he was about to be detained after the plane had landed, he looked "very calm". 
Another passenger, Mantas, who declined to give his surname, also said that Protasevich was "nervous at first, but 
later when he understood he can't change anything, he calmed down and accepted it".

Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte came to Vilnius Airport for the plane's arrival, as did dozens of 
Belarusian opposition supporters. 
Some were draped in the flags used by the opposition, while others held up signs supporting him, including one that 
read "Ryanair, Where is Roman?!". 
"We have to show our solidarity in order to avoid being broken one by one," said one of the opposition supporters, 
36-year-old Aleksandr Glachkov. 
 He called the detention of Protasevich a "crime".

Belarus forced the Athens-to-Vilnius plane to land in Minsk and detained Protasevich, who is wanted on various 
charges in connection with his activism against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. 
He lives in Poland, where he previously worked as an editor of Nexta, a highly influential Belarusian opposition 
channel on the Telegram messaging app. 
The incident has triggered international outrage and EU threats of further sanctions on Belarus, which has been 
shaken by unprecedented mass protests since a disputed election last year. 
Several passengers remembered seeing the 26-year-old Protasevich rifle through his bags and hand some items to 
his girlfriend after it became clear that the plane would be landing in Belarus. 
Edvinas Dimsa, 37, said he was "not screaming, but it was clear that he was very much afraid.

"It looked like if the window had been open, he would have jumped out of it," he said. 
Arthur Six, 25, a Frenchman, said he saw Protasevich appearing to complain to an air steward. 
Initially Six also thought Protasevich was "panicking, but after that he became calm again".

 Belarusian opposition Telegram channel Nexta said Sunday its former editor and exiled opposition activist Roman 
Protasevich had been detained in Minsk after his flight made an emergency landing under orders from President 
Alexander Lukashenko. 
 The move comes amid an intensifying crackdown following historic demonstrations that gripped the ex-Soviet 
country after a disputed presidential election last year. 
 Nexta Live and its sister channel Nexta — with close to 2 million subscribers on the Telegram messenger — are 
prominent voices of the Belarus opposition and helped mobilise protesters. 
 Belarusians took to the streets demanding the resignation of Lukashenko, who has ruled with an iron fist for over 
two decades and in August secured a landslide victory in an election his opponents say was rigged. 
 Protasevich was on Sunday aboard a Ryanair flight from Athens to the Lithuanian capital Vilnius, which made an 
emergency landing following a bomb scare, TASS news agency reported citing the press service of Minsk airport. 
 'The plane was checked, no bomb was found and all passengers were sent for another security search,' Nexta 
said.'Among them was Nexta journalist Roman Protasevich. He was detained.' 
 It added that Protasevich said he was followed before boarding the flight. 
 The Belarusian Interior Ministry initially confirmed the detention on Telegram, but the post was later deleted. 
 Last year, 26-year old Protasevich and Nexta founder Stepan Putilo, 22, were added to Belarus's list of 'individuals 
involved in terrorist activity'. 
 The two bloggers — who live in Poland — were added to the list based on earlier charges of causing mass unrest, 
an offence that can lead to up to 15 years of imprisonment. 
 Belarus had also labelled the Nexta Telegram channels and its logo 'extremist' and ordered it blocked. 
 - 'Abhorrent action' - 
The Telegram channel of Lukashenko's press service said the president gave the order to turn the flight around. It 
added that he also ordered a Mig-29 fighter jet to accompany the aircraft. 
 Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda on Twitter called the incident an 'unprecedented event' and said that the 
Belarus 'regime is behind the abhorrent action'. 
Exiled activist held at Belarus airport: opposition
 'It is absolutely obvious that this is an operation of secret services to capture the plane in order to detain activist 
and blogger Roman Protasevich,' exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said on Telegram.  
 The opposition believes that Tikhanovskaya, who fled to neighbouring Lithuania after the election, was the true 
winner of last year's presidential vote. 
 Both Tikhanovskaya and Nexta say that Protasevich could face the death penalty in Belarus. 
 A member of the Nexta team, Tadeusz Giczan, said on Twitter that representatives of the Belarusian security 
agency were on the flight with Protasevich. 
 'Then when the plane had entered Belarus airspace, the KGB officers initiated a fight with the Ryanair crew 
insisting there's an IED onboard,' he said. 
 A spokeswoman for state company 'Lithuanian airports', Lina Beisine, told AFP that Minsk airport said the flight 
was redirected 'due to a conflict between a member of the crew and the passengers'. 
 There was no immediate reaction from Ryanair. 
 The European Union and the United States have sanctioned Lukashenko and dozens of officials and businessmen 
tied to his regime with asset freezes and visa bans. 
 The historic Belarus protests, which left at least four people dead, have now subsided, but journalists and activists 
continue to receive prison sentences in the aftermath.

 Belarus forced an Athens-to-Vilnius Ryanair flight carrying a wanted opposition activist to divert and land in Belarus 
on Sunday, provoking a furious outcry from European leaders. 
 Belarusian state television reported that Roman Protasevich, a 26-year-old opposition blogger exiled in Poland, 
had been detained in Minsk after flight FR4978 was diverted from EU airspace — ostensibly over a security scare. 
 Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki denounced Belarus' diversion of the flight as 'an act of state 
terrorism', while French Foreign MinisterJean-Yves Le Drian called for a 'strong and united response' from the 
European Union. 
 The EU will discuss possible sanctions over the major diplomatic incident at a summit on Monday and Tuesday, a 
spokesman said. 
 After hours grounded in Belarus, the flight was able to continue on its journey, landing in Vilnius at 1825 GMT, the 
airport's online arrivals board said. 
 Officials had yet to confirm whether Protasevich was onboard or had remained in detention in Belarus. 
 Minsk's airport had released a statement earlier saying that the aircraft had to make an emergency landing there at 
1215 GMT following a bomb scare. 
 'The plane was checked, no bomb was found and all passengers were sent for another security search,' said 
Nexta, a Belarus opposition channel on the Telegram messaging app, which Protasevich previously edited. 
 The Telegram channel of Lukashenko's press service said the president had given the order to divert the flight. It 
added that he had also ordered a Mig-29 fighter jet to accompany the aircraft. 
 The incident comes as Belarus authorities intensify their crackdown on the opposition following historic protests 
that gripped the ex-Soviet country after last year's disputed presidential election. 
 - 'Absolutely unacceptable' - 
 The diversion of a flight between two EU countries to Belarus, and the arrest of an opposition activist who had 
been onboard, prompted a torrent of outrage from European leaders. 
 'We hold the government of Belarus responsible for the security of all passengers and the aircraft,' EU foreign 
policy chief Josep Borrell tweeted earlier. 
 'ALLpassengers must be able to continue their travel immediately,' he said, implicitly demanding Protasevich's 
release. 
EU outrage as Belarus diverts flight, arrests opposition activist
 Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda described the incident as 'unprecedented' and blamed the Belarus regime 
for the 'abhorrent action'. 
 In Greece, where the flight started its journey, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis tweeted: 'The forced landing of a 
commercial plane to detain a journalist is an unprecedented, shocking act. 
 'We demand all passengers' immediate release,' he added, calling for EU action to 'step up pressure on Belarus. 
Enough is enough'. 
 The government in Ireland, where Ryanair is headquartered, described the incident as 'absolutely unacceptable', 
while NATO called it 'dangerous' and demanded an international investigation. 
 Since last August's disputed election, Belarusians have taken to the streets demanding the resignation of 
Lukashenko, who has ruled for over two decades. 
 In 2020, Protasevich and Nexta founder Stepan Putilo, 22, were added to Belarus's list of 'individuals involved in 
terrorist activity'. 
 The two bloggers — both now based in Poland — were added to the list based on earlier charges of causing mass 
unrest, an offence that can lead to up to 15 years in jail. 
 Belarus had also labelled the Nexta Telegram channels and its logo 'extremist' and ordered them blocked.

insisting there's an IED onboard,' he said. 
 A spokeswoman for state company Lithuanian Airports, Lina Beisine, told AFP that Minsk airport had said the flight 
was redirected 'due to a conflict between a member of the crew and the passengers'. 
 Ryanair said the flight's crew had been notified by Belarus air traffic control of 'a potential security threat on board' 
and were instructed to divert to Minsk, the 'nearest' airport. 
 Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said there were 171 passengers aboard the flight, most of them 
Lithuanian nationals. 
 The EU and the United States have sanctioned Lukashenko and dozens of officials and businessmen tied to his 
regime with asset freezes and visa bans.

activists continue to receive prison sentences in the aftermath.

 European leaders accused Belarus of "hijacking" a Ryanair flight en route from Greece to Lithuania, after forcing 
the plane to land in Minsk over a supposed bomb threat, reports the Washington Post[1]. 
Why it matters: Among the flight's passengers was Roman Protasevich, a journalist and opposition leader wanted 
by the the Belarusian government, who was detained at the Minsk airport once the plane landed, the Post 
reported.[2] Protasevich co-founded the Telegram channel Nexta, which helped organize the mass anti-government 
demonstrations last year, per the AP[3]. He has been living in exile in Lithuania for several years out of fear of being 
arrested in Belarus, where he faces up to 12 years in prison if convicted on charges of "inciting hatred and mass 
disorder," per the New York Times[4]. The state of play: The plane was flying over Belarus and was six miles from 
the Lithuanian border when Belarusian air traffic control told the pilots to divert to Minsk due to "a potential security 
risk on board," per the the Post. The presidential press service said that President Alexander Lukashenko 
"personally ordered" a fighter jet to escort the flight down to the Minsk airport, the AP reported.Officials later 
confirmed no explosives were found on the airplane, per AP. The big picture: European leaders have widely 
condemned the move by Belarus. "I condemn in the strongest terms the detention of Roman Protasevich by 
Belarusian authorities, after a Ryanair passenger aircraft was hijacked. This is a reprehensible act of state 
terrorism," tweeted[5] Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, adding[6] that he has asked the European 
Council to discuss possible sanctions during their Monday. "Any violation of international air transport rules must 
bear consequences," said Ursula von der Leyen[7], the president of the EU commission. 'The regime forced the 
landing [of the] Ryanair plane in Minsk to arrest journalist and activist Roman Protasevich,' exiled opposition leader 
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said in a statement, while calling on the International Civil Aviation Organization to 
investigate the episode, per the Post.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab tweeted[8] that the U.K. was 
"alarmed" by the arrest of Protasevich and warned that "this outlandish action by Lukashenko will have serious 
implications." U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) also weighed in, tweeting[9] that the U.S. "needs to consider 
restricting commercial air traffic into and over Belarus until this matter is resolved. No travelers can feel safe if state 
sponsored hijacking becomes acceptable." 
Of note: The Ryanair flight continued on its way after the diversion to Minsk and landed in Lithuania later Sunday, 
reports Bloomberg[10].

 The Ryanair plane was en route to Vilnius when it was diverted to Minsk. The opposition says the move was a bid 
to arrest a journalist on board who is critical of Lukashenko's government.A Belarusian journalist and opposition 
activist is being held at an airport in Minsk after his Lithuania-bound flight was forced to land, opposition politicians 
and outlets reported on Sunday. 
Opposition figures swiftly criticized the move, which they said was a bid by the government of longtime leader 
Alexander Lukashenko to clamp down on critical voices. 
The official Belta news agency reported that a plane had been diverted, but did not mention whether an arrest had 
taken place. 
What we know so far 
A Ryanair flight traveling from Athens to Vilnius in Lithuania was diverted to land in Belarus, the flight tracking site 
Flightradar24 reported. 
The Belta news agency reported that the plane had been diverted to Minsk International Airport for an emergency 
landing due.  
An airport spokesperson told the agency that although authorities did not find any explosive devices on the plane, it 
was unclear when it would be allowed to take off again. 
The opposition Telegram channel Nexta also reported that the plane was searched and that authorities detained the 
outlet's former editor, Roman Protasevich. 
"The plane was checked, no bomb was found and all passengers were sent for another security search," said 
Nexta. "Among them was... Nexta journalist Roman Protasevich. He was detained." 
Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya described Pratasevich as a "journalist, photographer, blogger 
and activist," saying he "faces the death penalty" in Belarus. 
The Belarusian government has yet to comment. 
This is a breaking news story and will be updated.

 Passengers on Ryanair flight FR4978 described the anxious minutes for opposition blogger Roman Protasevich 
after he realised that the plane was being diverted to Minsk, where he was later detained. 
 'He started panicking and saying this was because of him,' Monika Simkiene, a 40-year-old Lithuanian, told AFP 
after the plane finally landed in Vilnius several hours later than its scheduled arrival time. 
 'He just turned to people and said he was facing the death penalty,' she said, adding that once Protasevich 
understood that he was about to be detained after the plane had landed, he looked 'very calm'. 
 Another passenger, Mantas, who declined to give his surname, also said that Protasevich was 'nervous at first, but 
later when he understood he can't change anything, he calmed down and accepted it'. 
 Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte came to Vilnius Airport for the plane's arrival, as did dozens of 
Belarusian opposition supporters. 
 Some were draped in the flags used by the opposition, while others held up signs supporting him, including one 
that read 'Ryanair, Where is Roman?!'. 
 'We have to show our solidarity in order to avoid being broken one by one,' said one of the opposition supporters, 
36-year-old Aleksandr Glachkov. 
 He called the detention of Protasevich a 'crime'. 
- 'He would have jumped out' - 
Belarus forced the Athens-to-Vilnius plane to land in Minsk and detained Protasevich, who is wanted on various 
charges in connection with his activism against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. 
 He lives in Poland, where he previously worked as an editor of Nexta, a highly influential Belarusian opposition 
channel on the Telegram messaging app. 
 The incident has triggered international outrage and EU threats of further sanctions on Belarus, which has been 
shaken by unprecedented mass protests since a disputed election last year. 
 Several passengers remembered seeing the 26-year-old Protasevich rifle through his bags and hand some items 
to his girlfriend after it became clear that the plane would be landing in Belarus. 
 Edvinas Dimsa, 37, said he was 'not screaming, but it was clear that he was very much afraid. 
Diverted flight passengers saw Belarus activist 'panicking'
 'It looked like if the window had been open, he would have jumped out of it,' he said. 
 Arthur Six, 25, a Frenchman, said he saw Protasevich appearing to complain to an air steward. 
 Initially Six also thought Protasevich was 'panicking, but after that he became calm again'.

 The German Foreign Ministry has demanded that Belarus explain the diversion of a Lithuania-bound flight. It 
questioned the arrest of a critic of the Minsk government who was on board.Berlin on Sunday demanded an 
explanation from the Belarusian government after military jets forced a Ryanair passenger plane to land in the 
capital, Minsk. 
The German Foreign Ministry also said answers were needed about the alleged arrest of a former editor from the 
Minsk-critical news outlet Nexta.  
The blogger Roman Protasevich was on the Athens-to-Vilnius Ryanair flight when a fighter jet intercepted the 
plane's path. The passenger plane's crew asked for permission to land, and Protasevich — who has been critical of 
President Alexander Lukashenko — was reportedly detained. 
"We need an immediate explanation by the government of Belarus on the diversion of a RyanAir flight within the EU 
to Minsk and the alleged detention of a journalist," the German Foreign Ministry's state secretary Miguel Berger 
wrote on Twitter. 
EU leaders hold Minsk accountable 
Meanwhile, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki condemned the arrests and said he had asked European 
Council President Charles Michel to consider sanctions. He said the actions could not go unpunished. 
"I condemn in the strongest terms the detention of Roman Protasevich by Belarusian authorities, after a Ryanair 
passenger aircraft was hijacked. This is a reprehensible act of state terrorism," he said. 
European Union officials also warned Belarus that it would be held responsible for the fate of the diverted flight, 
calling for all passengers to be released. 
"We hold the government of Belarus responsible for the security of all passengers and the aircraft," EU foreign 
policy chief Josep Borrell tweeted.  
"ALL passengers must be able to continue their travel immediately," he said, appearing to implicitly be demanding 
Protasevich's release.

The Greek Foreign Ministry has slammed the forced diversion of a Ryanair passenger flight to Minsk and the arrest 
of an opposition blogger who was on board.
"Greece strongly condemns the state hijacking that took place today, which resulted in the forced landing of Ryanair 
FR 4978, which operated the Athens-Vilnius route, in Minsk, Belarus," a ministry statement said.
"The plane had a total of 171 passengers, 11 of whom are Greek citizens. This act, which endangered the lives of 
all passengers, is unacceptable."
The Foreign Ministry condemned the arrest of Belarusian activist Roman Protasevich at the Minsk airport.
Protasevich was part of a delegation in Greece that participated in the international "Delphi Forum" last week, the 
Foreign Ministry added.
Every year, the Delphi Forum invites experts and politicians to discuss political and economic issues.
"Mr Protasevich was part of a delegation led by Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who 
recently attended the Delphi Forum.
"For Greece, defending fundamental values such as democracy, the rule of law, and human rights is a matter of 
principle," the ministry statement said.

 A civilian flight from Athens to Vilnius was forced to make an unplanned landing in Minsk, Belarus on May 23 after 
an allegedly false bomb threat on board. Upon landing, Belarusian authorities detained Raman Pratasevich, an 
independent journalist wanted by the Lukashenka government on extremist charges. 
 Pratasevich is a former administrator of the Telegram channelNEXTA-Live[2], which has been covering the anti-
government protests in Belarus. He recently became the editor-in-chief of Belarus Golovnogo Mozga[3](Belarus of 
the Brain), another Telegram-based independent media outlet.

 Our editor-in-chief, Roman Protasevich, has been detained in Minsk airport 
 A Ryanair airplane heading from Athens to Vilnuis has landed in Minsk's National airport. The airplane sent out a 
distress signal and changed course unexpectedly. 
 As reported[6] by the Media Solidarity Belarus campaign on Twitter, the FR4978 flight was close to the Lithuanian 
border when it wasdiverted[7] to land in Minsk. Belarus sent[8] a Mig-29 fighter jet to intercept the civilian plane and 
force a local landing. On the ground, Belarusian border and law enforcement officials inspected the passengers' 
luggage and IDs and subsequently detained Pratasevich. 
 While on the flight, the journalist had reportedly messaged his friends to indicate he may have been shadowed by 
Belarusian state security. His whereabouts are currently unknown, though according to Euroradio, police have 
confirmed[9] his arrest.

 In November 2020, Belarusian authorities announced that Pratasevich, along with another NEXTA-Live 
administrator Stsyapan Putsila, were being investigated on charges of organising mass disorder, disrupting public 
order, and inciting social hatred. NEXTA-Live and the Belarus Golovnogo Mozga channel were both designated 
'extremist' by Belarusian authorities. The latter channel's founder, Ihar Losik, has been in jail since June 2020 and 
recently ended[13] a six-week hunger strike. 
 Both Pratasevich and Putsila had previously moved abroad fearing prosecution after other activists' arrests. 
 Based on the charges against him, Pratasevich could face a lengthy jail term and, potentially, more severe 
consequences. 
20. Pratasevich is facing the following charges in #Belarus[14]: 
Article 130 p.3 of Criminal Code - inciting social hatred based on professional affiliation, 
Article 293 - organizing mass riots

 Though the grounding of a civilian flight by Belarus is unprecedented, Pratasevich's detention is only the latest 
episode in the ongoing crackdown[27] against Belarusian independent media. According to the Belarusian 
Association of Journalists, 29 reporters[28] are currently behind bars. 
 On May 21,Belarusian law enforcement raided[29] the Minsk studio used by Belsat, a Polish-based TV station that 
has produced investigations critical of Lukashenka and his milieu. Six Belsat employees were detained. Earlier this 
year, two Belsat journalists,Daria Chultsova and Katsiaryna Andreyeva,were handed[30] two-year prison sentences 
for reporting live from a Minsk protest rally.

 Journalist Raman Pratasevich might face the death penalty after Belarusian authorities forced his plane to land in 
Minsk. A passenger on the flight described Pratasevich's reaction.Raman Pratasevich, a 26-year-old Belarusian 
national, was "upset" after realizing the Ryanair fllght he was on was unexpectedly landing in Minsk, a witness told 
Radio Free Europe's Belarus department on Sunday. 
"After a sudden turn of the plane, one guy [Pratasevich] started panicking, grabbing his head," the source, another 
passenger on the flight said. "There was no conflict up until the plane turned, no falling out, nothing." 
Belarus claims a bomb scare 
According to pro-government media in Belarus, President Alexander Lukashenko himself ordered a MiG-29 fighter 
jet to be scrambled and intercept the Ryanair jet over an alleged bomb scare. No bomb was found on the plane. 
Instead, Belarusian authorities detained the exiled reporter Pratasevich, who had been traveling from Greece to 
Lithuania. Pratesevich faces criminal charges in Belarus, including inciting hatred against the government. He is 
also on the nation's list of "individuals involved in terrorist activity." Belarus opposition leaders say he could face the 
death penalty in his native country. 
Reporter's luggage 'thrown out' onto the runway 
Upon landing in Minsk, security forces took the passengers out and had sniffer dog teams inspect their belongings, 
the passenger told Radio Free Europe. 
Pratasevich's luggage was "thrown out on the runway" and he was taken aside. 
"We asked him what was going on." the passenger said. "He told us who he was and added: 'A death penalty 
awaits me here.' He was a bit calmer, but trembling." 
Eventually, he was taken away by the military, according to the source. 
Pratesevich previously served as the editor-in-chief of opposition news outlet NEXTA, which the Belarus authorities 
have labeled as extremist. 
Pratesevich suspected he was followed in Athens 
In a separate interview to Deutsche Welle, an aide to opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Franak Viacorka 
said Pratesevich was in touch with him before boarding the plane and told him he suspected he was being followed. 
"This morning I was in touch with Raman he shared [with me] concerns that someone was following him in Athens 
airport," the politician said. 
NEXTA also shared texts sent out by Pratasevich from Athens, in which he described a suspicious Russian-
speaking man who seemed to try to get a photo of his travel documents. 
Belarus reporter said 'death penalty awaits me here' — witness
"The great thing is, that he was the next in line to get his documents checked, and he just turned and walked away 
at the gate," Pratasevich wrote, describing the man as "middle-aged, built, balding" and carrying a leather suitcase. 
Talking to DW, Viacorka described the 26-year-old reporter as a "personal enemy of Lukashenko," saying that 
Pratesevich was "posting videos and pictures from a protest about torture in prisons, about the conditions in jails. 
He was one of the most prominent figures speaking about the horrible violations of human rights." 
"I think what we saw today, it was their revenge, personal revenge of Lukashenko against Raman and his principled 
position right now," he told DW.

"The fact that a flight between two EU states was forced to make a stopover under the pretext of a bomb threat is a 
serious interference in civil air traffic in Europe," Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in a statement, calling for "clear 
consequences" to be taken against the government in Minsk.
"We are very concerned about reports that journalist Roman Protasevich was arrested this way," Maas said of the 
activist.
He urged the issue to be taken up at a previously scheduled meeting of EU leaders on Monday in Brussels.
The Ryanair plane was en route from Athens to the Lithuanian capital Vilnius on Sunday when it was ordered to 
land in Minsk by air traffic controllers who said they had identified a potential security threat on board.

A Ryanair flight flying over Belarus airspace en route to Lithuania was allegedly forced to land in Minsk. The 
unexpected landing was allegedly the work of Belarus regime in order to arrest noted journalist Raman Pratasevich,

 According to reports, Pratasevich has been arrested by the regime and could face death penalty for his opposition 
activities, said exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.

to arrest a journalist on board who is critical of Lukashenko's government.A Belarusian journalist and opposition 
activist is being held at an airport in Minsk after his Lithuania-bound flight was forced to land, opposition politicians 
and outlets reported on Sunday. 
Opposition figures swiftly criticized the move, which they said was a bid by the government of longtime leader

taken place.

Flightradar24 reported. 
The Belta news agency reported that the plane had been diverted to Minsk International Airport for an emergency 
landing due.  
An airport spokesperson told the agency that although authorities did not find any explosive devices on the plane, it 
was unclear when it would be allowed to take off again. 
The opposition Telegram channel Nexta also reported that the plane was searched and that authorities detained the 
outlet's former editor, Roman Protasevich. 
"The plane was checked, no bomb was found and all passengers were sent for another security search," said 
Nexta. "Among them was... Nexta journalist Roman Protasevich. He was detained." 
Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya described Pratasevich as a "journalist, photographer, blogger 
and activist," saying he "faces the death penalty" in Belarus.

 The German Foreign Ministry has demanded that Belarus explain the diversion of a Lithuania-bound flight, and the 
detention of a journalist onboard. EU leaders expressed shock and said Minsk would be held accountable.Berlin on 
Sunday demanded an explanation from the Belarusian government after military jets forced a Ryanair passenger 
plane to land in the capital, Minsk. 
The German Foreign Ministry also said answers were needed about the alleged arrest of a former editor from the 
Minsk-critical news outlet Nexta.  
The blogger Roman Protasevich was on the Athens-to-Vilnius Ryanair flight when a fighter jet intercepted the 
plane's path. 
The passenger plane's crew asked for permission to land, and Protasevich — who has been critical of President 
Alexander Lukashenko — was reportedly detained. 
'Immediate explanation' required 
"We need an immediate explanation by the government of Belarus on the diversion of a Ryanair flight within the EU 
to Minsk and the alleged detention of a journalist," the German Foreign Ministry's state secretary Miguel Berger 
wrote on Twitter. 
French Foreign Affairs Minister said the incident was "unacceptable" and called for a "firm and united response." 
Shock from Greece and Lithuania 
Leaders of the flight's departure and destination nations, Greece and Lithuania, were among the first to respond. 
Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the events were "unprecedented and shocking." 
"We demand all passengers' immediate release. Tomorrow's #EUCO must address the need to step up pressure 
on Belarus. Enough is enough," Mitsoatakis said in a tweet. 
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda slammed the decision to target a civilian aircraft as "unprecedented" and 
"abhorrent." 
Meanwhile, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki condemned the arrests and said he had asked European 
Council President Charles Michel to consider sanctions. He said the actions could not go unpunished. 
Belarus flight: Germany demands explanation of diversion, arrest
"I condemn in the strongest terms the detention of Roman Protasevich by Belarusian authorities after a Ryanair 
passenger aircraft was hijacked. This is a reprehensible act of state terrorism," he said. 
EU chiefs hold Minsk accountable 
Some 171 passengers on board the flight — between two European Union member states — were unable to 
proceed with their journey. 
Bloc officials warned Belarus that it would be held responsible for the fate of the diverted flight, calling for all 
passengers to be released. 
"We hold the government of Belarus responsible for the security of all passengers and the aircraft," EU foreign 
policy chief Josep Borrell tweeted. 
"ALL passengers must be able to continue their travel immediately," he said, appearing to implicitly be demanding 
Protasevich's release. 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen echoed this message. 
"ALL passengers must be able to continue their travel to Vilnius immediately and their safety ensured," she said, in 
a separate tweet. "Any violation of international air transport rules must bear consequences," she warned. 
European Council President Charles Michel, who is set to host a summit of 27 EU national leaders on Monday, said 
it was "essential" that the International Civil Aviation Organization investigate.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A founder of a messaging app channel that has been a key information conduit for 
opponents of Belarus' authoritarian president was arrested Sunday after an airliner in which he was traveling on 
was diverted to Belarus because of a bomb threat. 
 The presidential press service said President Alexander Lukashenko personally ordered that a MiG-29 fighter jet 
accompany the Ryanair plane — traveling from Athens, Greece, to Vilnius, Lithuania — to the Minsk airport.  
 The Belarusian Interior Ministry said Raman Pratasevich was arrested at the airport. Pratasevich is a co-founder of 
the Telegram messaging app's Nexta channel, which Belarus last year declared as extremist after it was used to 
help organize major protests against Lukashenko. 
 Pratasevich, who had fled the country for Poland, faces charges that could carry a prison sentence of up to 15 
years. 
 The presidential press service said the bomb threat was received while the plane was over Belarusian territory; 
officials later said no explosives were found on board. There was no immediate comment from Ryanair. 
 Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya called on the International Civil Aviation Organization to begin 
an investigation. 
 'It is absolutely obvious that this is an operation by the special services to hijack an aircraft in order to detain 
activist and blogger Raman Pratasevich,' she said in a statement. 'Not a single person who flies over Belarus can 
be sure of his safety.' 
 Months of protests arose after last August's presidential election that official results say gave Lukashenko a sixth 
term in office.  
 Police cracked down on the protests harshly, detaining some 30,000 people and beating many of them. 
Belarus opposition figure detained when flight diverted
 Although protests died down during the winter, Belarus has continued to take actions against the opposition and 
independent news media. Last week, 11 staff members of the TUT.by news website were detained by police. (Ad)

7 Stocks That Could Benefit From a Capital Gains Tax Hike[2] One thing every investor needs to learn is the effect 
of capital gains on their investments. Every time an investor sells a stock that has appreciated in value, that capital 
gain is subject to being taxed. Stocks that are held for less than a year pay a short-term capital gains tax rate. 
Stocks that are held for over a year pay a long-term capital gains tax rate. 
 In general, a capital gains tax hike is a bearish indicator for stocks. However, there are a couple of strategies that 
can help investors avoid some of the tax hit. One strategy is to keep your investments in an individual retirement 
account (IRA) or 401(k). However many higher-income earners want to have more access to the funds in their 
brokerage accounts. 
 A sound strategy for these investors involves buying dividend stocks. Dividend income is also taxed (unless it is 
reinvested), but typically when the capital gains tax rate is raised, the dividend income rate stays the same. This 
makes dividend stocks more attractive. 
 Investing in dividend stocks is never a bad idea, but at times when the capital gains tax rate is favorable, growth 
stocks provide a better reward for investor capital. But when long-term capital gains tax rates go up, those gains 
can get expensive. 
 In this special presentation, we'll give you seven stocks that have a nice dividend yield and a strong story to go 
along with them.

 A Belarusian journalist wanted by the government of Alexander Lukashenko was arrested after the plane he was 
traveling on made an unscheduled landing in Minsk on May 23 after what appears to have been a false bomb 
threat. 
Raman Pratasevich was taken away by police shortly after the Ryanair flight, which was on a scheduled route from 
Athens to Vilnius, landed in the Belarusian capital. 
No bomb was found, according to Belarussian media reports. No further details were immediately available. It was 
unclear who had reported the bomb threat. 
The headquarters of Belarusian opposition leader Svaitlana Tsikhanouskaya reported that the Ryanair flight crew 
received a message about a bomb on board the plane and that a MiG-29 military fighter was dispatched to escort 
the passenger jet to the airport in Minsk. 
Tsikhanouskaya's office said the flight was near the border with Lithuania when the message was received. It was 
closer to the airport in Vilnius but instead it headed to Minsk. 
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said it was an "unprecedented event" that a civilian passenger plane flying 
to Vilnius was forced to land in Minsk. 
"Flag of Belarus regime is behind the abhorrent action. I demand to free Roman Protasevic urgently!" Nauseda said 
on Twitter. 
Pratasevich was a key administrator of the Telegram channel NEXTA Live, which has been covering the protests 
that broke out in Belarus following the country's disputed presidential election last August. 
In November, Belarusian authorities announced that Pratasevich, along with Stsyapan Putsila -- also a NEXTA Live 
administrator -- were being investigated on suspicions of organizing mass disorder, disrupting the social order, and 
inciting social hatred. 
Belarus Journalist Arrested after Flight Diverted to Minsk
Belarus has been rocked by protests since Lukashenka, in power since 1994, was declared the landslide winner of 
the poll amid allegations of vote-rigging. Since then, more than 30,000 people have been detained, hundreds 
beaten or tortured, and journalists targeted in the crackdown by Lukashenka, whose government has been hit by 
Western sanctions. 
In October, a court in Minsk designated the NEXTA Live channel and its logo as extremist and instructed the 
Information Ministry to restrict access to information resources using the name and logo of the Telegram channel, 
as well as their distribution in the Belarusian segment of the Internet. 
NEXTA Live then changed its name and logo, switching from the Latin transliteration of its name to a Cyrillic one. 
Fearing prosecution, Pratasevich and Putsila fled the country and their whereabouts have not been known. 
In October, Putsila, along with several Belarusian activists, received the European Parliament's 2020 Sakharov 
Prize for Freedom of Thought. 
Media in Belarus have been targeted by the Lukashenka government in the ongoing crackdown. The watchdog 
Reporters Without Borders has designated Belarus as the most dangerous spot in Europe for journalists. 
On May 21, Belarusian security forces raided a Minsk studio used by a Polish-based TV station that has produced 
investigations critical of Lukashenka and his associates. 
Belsat said uniformed officers broke into a studio on May 21 used for producing a talk show, detaining six people, 
including four cameramen. 
In April, the channel published an investigation into the business dealings of Lukashenka's daughter-in-law and 
others associated with him. 
Earlier this year, two journalists for Belsat were handed what their lawyers called an "absurd" sentence of two years 
in prison each for reporting live from a rally in Minsk in November. 
Earlier this week, police launched a probe of the country's largest independent online media outlet, Tut.by, 
searching the homes of several of its editors and blocking its website. 
Meanwhile, a Minsk court on May 21 sentenced another reporter who covered the police raid on Tut.by to a 15-day 
prison sentence, a media advocacy group said. 
The Belarusian Association of Journalists said 27 media workers are currently behind bars, either awaiting trial or 
serving sentences.

 Journalist Raman Pratasevich might face the death penalty after Belarusian authorities forced his plane to land in 
Minsk. A passenger on the flight described Pratasevich's reaction.Raman Pratasevich, a 26-year-old Belarusian 
national, was "upset" after realizing the Ryanair fllght he was on was unexpectedly landing in Minsk, a witness told 
Radio Free Europe's Belarus department on Sunday. 
"After a sudden turn of the plane, one guy [Pratasevich] started panicking, grabbing his head," the source, another 
passenger on the flight said. "There was no conflict up until the plane turned, no falling out, nothing." 
Belarus claims a bomb scare 
According to pro-government media in Belarus, President Alexander Lukashenko himself ordered a MiG-29 fighter 
jet to be scrambled and intercept the Ryanair jet over an alleged bomb scare. No bomb was found on the plane. 
Instead, Belarusian authorities detained the exiled reporter Pratasevich, who had been traveling from Greece to 
Lithuania. Pratesevich faces criminal charges in Belarus, including inciting hatred against the government. He is 
also on the nation's list of "individuals involved in terrorist activity." Belarus opposition leaders say he could face the 
death penalty in his native country. 
Reporter's luggage 'thrown out' onto the runway 
Upon landing in Minsk, security forces took the passengers out and had sniffer dog teams inspect their belongings, 
the passenger told Radio Free Europe. 
Pratasevich's luggage was "thrown out on the runway" and he was taken aside. 
"We asked him what was going on." the passenger said. "He told us who he was and added: 'A death penalty 
awaits me here.' He was a bit calmer, but trembling." 
Eventually, he was taken away by the military, according to the source. 
Pratesevich previously served as the editor-in-chief of opposition news outlet NEXTA, which the Belarus authorities 
have labeled as extremist. 
Pratesevich suspected he was followed in Athens 
In a separate interview to Deutsche Welle, an aide to opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Franak Viacorka 
said Pratesevich was in touch with him before boarding the plane and told him he suspected he was being followed. 
"This morning I was in touch with Raman he shared [with me] concerns that someone was following him in Athens 
airport," the politician said. 
NEXTA also shared texts sent out by Pratasevich from Athens, in which he described a suspicious Russian-
speaking man who seemed to try to get a photo of his travel documents. 
Belarus reporter said 'death penalty awaits me here' — witness
"The great thing is, that he was the next in line to get his documents checked, and he just turned and walked away 
at the gate," Pratasevich wrote, describing the man as "middle-aged, built, balding" and carrying a leather suitcase. 
Talking to DW, Viacorka described the 26-year-old reporter as a "personal enemy of Lukashenko," saying that 
Pratesevich was "posting videos and pictures from a protest about torture in prisons, about the conditions in jails. 
He was one of the most prominent figures speaking about the horrible violations of human rights." 
"I think what we saw today, it was their revenge, personal revenge of Lukashenko against Raman and his principled 
position right now," he told DW.

Vaccination rates may offer some hope, but negligible growth is expected in international air traffic forecast for this 
year
Though there is undoubtedly pent-up demand, with thousands of holidaymakers already booked for travel to "green 
list" countries, the fear is that the industry won't see the full benefits of the key summer holiday period, adding 
further pressure on industry balance sheets.
Portugal, a popular holiday destination, made it on to the UK government's list of countries without travel quarantine 
restrictions.
That's certainly good news for easyJet given the number of flights it normally runs to the country.
The budget carrier's management said the airline is capable of ramping up operational capacity to 90 per cent of its 
current fleet in a short space of time. Indeed, the carrier added 105,000 seats following the announcement of the 
green light destinations.
Like its rival Ryanair, details of easyJet's March interim figures make grim reading: a headline loss of £701m; a 26.6 
percentage point reduction in the load factor; and an 89 per cent fall in passenger numbers.
This is all predictable in a sense, but any further easing of restrictions is unlikely to trigger a sudden return to 
prepandemic volumes, so the airlines will probably have to endure another lean season, with "liquidity" remaining 
the watchword for the industry. Prospects remain intertwined with the clinical situation on the ground.
