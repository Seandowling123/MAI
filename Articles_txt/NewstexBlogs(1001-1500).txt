May 21, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings Plc 
RYAAY[1] incurred a loss of 74 cents per share in fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 (ended Mar 31, 2019), wider than the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 64 cents. The company had reported earnings of 30 cents per share a year 
ago.Revenues came in at $1,451 million compared with $1,623 million recorded in the year-ago period.Fiscal 2019 
ResultsIn fiscal 2019, revenues increased 6% to €7.15 billion on account of a 19% increase in ancillary revenues to 
€2.4 billion. In euro terms, Ryanair's full-year profit (excluding LaudaMotion) declined 29% to €1.02 billion due to a 
6% decline in airfares. 
Unit costs, excluding fuel, rose 5% due to higher labor costs among other factors.Ryanair's below-par performance 
disappointed investors. Consequently, the stock declined around 2% at the close of business on May 
20.Meanwhile, fiscal 2019 traffic (excluding LaudaMotion) increased 7% to 139 million, while load factor improved 
to 96% from 95% a year ago. Including LaudaMotion, traffic grew 9% to 142 million. Capital expenditures during the 
period were in excess of €1.5 billion. So, net debt inched up slightly year over year to €450 million.During fiscal 
2019, the company returned more than €560 million to its shareholders through buybacks. Ryanair has also cleared 
a new buyback program worth €700 million, which will commence later this week and run through the next 9-12 
months.Ryanair

due to delivery delays of the B737 MAX aircraft and other factors. Notably, the carrier has delayed the delivery of

May 21, 2019( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex)  Racing 
driver Niki Lauda, three-time Formula One champion, has passed away "peacefully" and surrounded by family. 
Lauda's health had been permanently damaged by his Nürburgring 1976 crash.Austrian-born Niki Lauda, one of the 
greatest Formula One drivers of all time, died at the age of 70, his lawyer and a family spokesman confirmed early 
on Tuesday."With deep sadness we announce that our beloved Niki passed away peacefully surrounded by family 
on Monday," a spokeswoman for Lauda's airline Laudamotion said in a statement carried by Austria's public 
broadcaster ORF and Germany's DPA news agency."His unique achievements as an athlete and entrepreneur are 
and will remain unforgettable."Lauda has struggled with health problems ever since his 1976 crash. 
The racing driver crashed his Ferrari car at Germany's Nürburgring Nordschleife race and remained trapped in the 
cockpit for 55 seconds, suffering burns and inhaling toxic fumes. As well as his distinctive facial scarring, Lauda's 
crash caused a number of long-term health issues, prompting two kidney transplants in 1997 and 2005. Last 
summer, Lauda developed a lung infection and was then forced to undergo an emergency lung transplant. He was 
hospitalized again in January this year with the flu. The legend of Lauda The Austrian-born Lauda first snatched the 
F1 drivers' title with Ferrari in 1975. After surviving the Nürburgring crash, he managed to recover and go back into 
the competition in just 42 days, finishing second behind UK's James Hunt. The Austrian won the championship 
again for Ferrari in 1977 and retired at the end of the 1979 season. However, he came back to the paddock in 1984, 
joining McLaren, and in 1985 became the sole driver ever to win an F1 title having returned from retirement.A movie 
starring Daniel Brühl as Lauda and Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt premiered in cinemas in 2013.After his 
definitive retirement in 1985, Lauda made money as an entrepreneur, founding his own airline but later selling most 
of it to Ryanair. He also worked as a TV commentator and served as the non-executive chairman for the Mercedes' 
F1 team, in which he was a shareholder.Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.

have plunged at Ryanair and Easyjet, while 43% of troubled tour operator Thomas Cook's summer holidays remain 
unsold. The travel sector can only lick its wounds and wait out the Brexit uncertainty.The dark cloud of Brexit still 
looms large over Europe's tourism industry, despite the delay to Britain's withdrawal from the European 
Union.Fewer Europeans are visiting the UK. According to tourism agency Visit Britain, overseas arrivals were down 
5.3% last year, while a similar pattern has been observed in the first few months of 2019.Tour operator Thomas 
Cook, meanwhile, reported a 27% rise in the number of Britons choosing longer-haul holiday destinations instead of 
their usual European retreats.In the month's leading up to Britain's planned EU departure date of March 29, the 
tourism sector warned that the threat of customs delays, visas and even potential EU airspace restrictions had 
prompted a considerable drop in overseas bookings.These concerns have been heightened over the past few days 
by changing fortunes of some of Europe's largest travel firms.Read more: Lufthansa looks to snap up Thomas 
Cook's Condor airlineAirlines drops faresOn Monday, Ryanair became the latest to cite consumers' unease over 
Brexit for its drop in profits.The Irish budget airline, whose biggest airport base is London Stansted, announced its 
2018 full year profits fell 29% to €1.02 billion ($1.14 billion).Although its own passenger numbers grew last year, it 
was forced to lower fares by 6% amid rising costs and a struggling pound against the euro — the currency in which 
it discloses its financial results.Chief Executive Michael O'Leary admitted that the company had noticed a "later 
booking pattern," and that the firm was "having to stimulate bookings with lower airfares."The company warned that 
for 2019, its fares would continue to fall in the UK and Germany and that it couldn't predict the second half of its 
financial year, which begins as the new October deadline for Britain to leave the EU expires.As Britain accounts for 
around a quarter of Ryanair's revenues, a disorderly EU departure could leave Europe's No. 1 low-cost carrier 
particularly vulnerable."There's no doubt Brexit is still having a big impact on passenger flows for several airlines," 
Johanna Bonhill-Smith, Associate Research Analyst at the UK-based Global Data, told DW.Last week, Ryanair's 
fiercest competitor, Easyjet, said its net losses more than quadrupled in its first half to 218 million pounds (€250 
million, $280 million). CEO Johan Lundgren blamed "macroeconomic uncertainty and many unanswered questions 
surrounding Brexit."Read more: Might the poolside towel war be over?'

interview with British media, "It's definitely a tougher trading environment, which has an effect on the

for the third quarter were already down 4% on last year and flat for the busy summer fourth quarter.Bonhill-Smith 
said she was confident both Ryanair and Easyjet would offset the lower demand from British travelers through the 
expansion of alternative hubs across Europe."Both of them have launched several new routes from other European 
Easyjet, Thomas Cook and Ryanair — Brexit's effect on tourism's big names
airports this year," she told DW. Ryanair said it had added 406 new routes and nine new bases last year, while 
Easyjet added 7% capacity last year from its new Berlin hub alone.Read more: Mallorca aims for refined cocktails,

holidays.Thomas Cook admitted last week that more than 40% of its package holidays remain unsold. Its share 
price plummeted to just 10p after its third profit warning and a 1.5 billion pound half-year loss.On Monday, the 
company had to reassure holidaymakers that it wasn't about go bankrupt and leave them stranded, just as when 
competitors Monarch Airlines and Flybmi collapsed recently.German competitor TUI, which is listed on the London 
Stock Exchange, also reported widening losses in the first half. It said earlier this year that holiday bookings had 
stalled due to Brexit uncertainty and the struggling pound.Global Data's Bonhill-Smith said the travel and tourism 
sector had no choice but to "wait out" the next few months."I don't think travel flows between Britain and the rest of 
Europe will stay as they are when we know the outcome of Brexit," she added.

UK's 'Mr. Brexit' Nigel Farage eyes EU election success

May 20, 2019( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex)  With 
Brexit postponed, the UK is holding European Parliament elections. Supporters of Nigel Farage's new party are 
hoping for a strong showing. DW's Birgit Maas reports from Wales on an unusual campaign season.Nigel Farage 
has traveled to Wales to campaign on behalf of his new Brexit Party ahead of the European Parliament elections. 
An exuberant crowd awaits him in the small coastal town of Newport. "Here I am again," he tells his supporters, with 
his last word drowned out by loud applause. Hundreds of Farage fans have come here today from the surrounding 
area to see their political idol in person.Farage's new party could emerge as the strongest British party competing in 
the European Parliament elections. In Wales, he tells his fans that his political movement wants nothing less than a 
"rebirth" of British democracy. Brexit was merely the beginning of this renewal, he says, accusing other UK 
lawmakers of failing to actually go through with the move.Read more: Easyjet, Thomas Cook and Ryanair — 
Brexit's effect on tourism's big names Feeling of betrayalBy and large, Farage supporters feel they have been 
betrayed by the British political class. Many people in Newport voted for the Conservative Party in the last elections, 
yet now feel that Prime Minster Theresa May and her government are not delivering as promised.Monima 
O'Connor, who lives in a tiny village in western Wales, is one of those people. She cannot fathom why after all this 
time Britain still has not managed to emancipate itself from the much maligned "Brussels bureaucrats." Together 
with her husband, O'Connor runs a shop selling sanitary goods. As they only sell to domestic customers, she does 
not see the point of Britain being in the European Union.Many Farage fans like her feel Prime Minister May has 
"betrayed" them. They want Britain to leave the EU as fast as possible, no matter the cost.Farage draws roaring 
applause from the crowd when he rails against Westminster politicians. He accuses them of just serving themselves 
— a reproach he used to only direct at Brussels lawmakers.Read more: Brexit drives firms to relocate to 
Germany'We must stop Farage'Meanwhile, an hour's drive further south in the city of Bath, Rachel Johnson is 
campaigning for her new party, Change UK. She is former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson's sister, and it's the first 
time she is running for a seat in the European Parliament.Rachel Johnson is adamant that "we must stop Farage" 
and has called for a second Brexit referendum. She says this would be paramount to put an end to the protracted 
political chaos.Frustration over handling of Brexit Change UK is a pan-party alliance of British lawmakers from both 
the Labour and Conservative parties. What unites them is their frustration about their respective parties' inefficient 
way of dealing with Brexit. That's why they're campaign for a second referendum. This is the first the time the party 
is competing in the European Parliamentary elections.But unlike Farage's exuberant campaign event in Wales, far 
fewer people have turned up to hear Johnson speak in Bath. She says she can understand why many Brits are fed 
up with the status-quo and now want to finally leave the EU because they're sick and tired of the topic.Read more:

UK's 'Mr. Brexit' Nigel Farage eyes EU election success
Guy Verhofstadt, meanwhile, is campaigning on behalf of the Liberal Democrats in central London. "We want to be 
the European voice against nationalists and populists," he says.However, polls show that Farage's Brexit Party 
could win up 35% of the vote, while the Liberal Democrats are projected to take just 16%. And just 5% of the 
electorate will, if the polls are accurate, cast their ballot for Change UK.Pro-European parties do not look like they 
have a chance against Farage's party. And instead of joining forces, they are competing against each other, 
arguing that Brexit is the wrong response to real issues that need to be addressed.Farage's message, in contrast, is 
simple and catchy. He promises to make Brits proud of their homeland again. And lashes out against "career 
politicians," even though he himself has spent many years working as a Brussels lawmaker.After the Newport 
campaign stop draws to a close, many attendees join Farage's party. And Monima O'Connor grabs a Farage 
poster, which she wants to put up in her village. Because, as she says, his Brexit Party is "wonderful."

— Budget airline Ryanair says its profit fell 29% last year and warns that the grounding of Boeing's 737 Max planes 
will limit its ability to cut costs.Europe's largest carrier by passengers said earnings for the year ending March 31 fell 
to 1.02 billion euros ($1.14 billion) from 1.45 billion euros the previous year. Strong 7% traffic growth was offset by a 
6% decline in fares.Boeing grounded its 737 MAX planes after two crashes raised concerns about flight-control 
software. It said last week it has finished updating the software, though it remains unclear when the grounding will 
end.Ryanair had wanted to use the fuel-efficient planes to cut costs. But it delayed delivery of its first five Max 
planes until the winter so those savings won't happen until 2021. The Associated Press

May 08, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, GOL 
Linhas Aereas Inteligentes GOL[1] reported lower-than-expected earnings for first-quarter 2019. Results were hurt 
by 16.2% depreciation of the Brazilian real against the US dollar and high fuel costs. Moreover, this Latin-American 
carrier tweaked its guidance for 2019 and 2020.On the non-earnings front, Delta Air Lines DAL[2], Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[3] and SkyWest SKYW[4] released their respective traffic reports for April. American Airlines AAL[5] also hit 
the headlines, courtesy of its decision to expand at Dallas Fort Worth Airport (DFW).(Read the last Airline Stock 
Rounduphere[6]).Recap of Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Gol Linhas' first-quarter 2019 earnings (excluding 
14 cents from non-recurring items) of 9 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 24 cents. Net 
revenues of R$3.2 billion improved 8.3% year over year owing to solid demand for air travel and a strong pricing. 
Passenger revenues accounted for the bulk (94.5%) of the top line and rose 8.4% on a year-over-year basis. For 
2019, GOL Linhas anticipates net revenues of approximately R$13 billion compared with R$12.9 billion expected 
previously. Additionally, earnings are envisioned in the range of 70-90 cents per share for the current year. 
Previously, the estimate was in the $1.30-$1.50 band. Additionally, earnings per share for 2020 are now anticipated 
between $1 and $1.3 compared with $1.70 and $2 projected earlier. (Read more: Gol Linhas Misses on Q1 
Earnings, Tweaks '19 ...0 View[7])Gol Linhas carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of 
today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8].2. At Delta, consolidated traffic — measured in revenue 
passenger miles (RPMs) — came in at 19.34 billion, up 5.9% year over year. Consolidated capacity (or available 
seat miles/ASMs) climbed 5% to 22.52 billion on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, the carrier recorded an on-
time performance (mainline) of 86.2% and a completion factor (mainline) of 99.8%. Notably, Delta's passenger 
count rose 6.6% to almost 17 billion in April. (Read more: Delta Posts Increase in April Traffic ...ad Factor[9])3. At 
Ryanair, April traffic (including 0.5 million from its LaudaMotion unit) rose 10% year over year to 13.5 million. Load 
factor remained flat at 96%. Notably, this European carrier operated more than 7500 scheduled flights in April. On a 
rolling annual basis, traffic rose 9% year over year to 142.3 million.4. SkyWest reported a 6.2% year-over-year 
increase in block hours (a measure of aircraft utilization) to 118,963 in April. The carrier stated that the rise in block 
hours was owing to the addition of E175 and CRJ900 aircraft to its fleet since April 2018. Meanwhile, the company's 
dual class aircraft (E175, CRJ900 and CRJ700) accounted for approximately 65.5% of the carrier's total block-hour

kicked off in Germany, which will reach millions of people in seven cities across the country. 
The ads are highlighting the Wild Atlantic Way and are running in German cities with direct flights to Ireland - 
Munich, Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Düsseldorf, Cologne, Hamburg and Berlin. The campaign is part of Tourism Ireland's 
latest promotion in Germany, in conjunction with Filte Ireland, to highlight the Wild Atlantic Way to German 
holidaymakers, and includes a 15 second video ad running on digital TV stations. Germany is the third-largest 
source of visitors to the island of Ireland and one of the largest outbound travel markets in the world. 2018 was the 
eighth consecutive year of growth for Irish tourism from Germany, with almost 818,000 Germans arriving to Ireland, 
delivering almost €500m to the economy. Peter Nash, Tourism Ireland's Manager, Central Europe, said: 'Germans 
who are interested in taking a holiday which involves sightseeing and local culture remain our core audience; we 
are also targeting people who engage in outdoor activities while on holidays.' Recently, Tourism Ireland's Fill Your

islooking to delay the implementation of a rescue plan for the ailing national carrier Alitalia. 
The deadline for FS to submit its proposal was29 April.but the company was later granteda one-month extension. 
The European Commission objects to further delays as Italy's national carrier has been under special administration 
since 2017. Alitalia's unions and administrators have failed to come to an agreement with low-cost carriers 
interested in rescuing the company, including EasyJet and Ryanair. Other than the FS proposal, there is currently 
no alternative for the future of Italy's national carrier. If that fails, the company is in danger of being liquidated. For 
its part, the Italian government is encouraging the FS takeover, which would encourage transport synergies and 
avoid layoffs. The plan entails an alliance with Alitalia's strategic ally, Delta Airlines, to give rise to a transport 
consortium that would offer a so-called 'one stop shop' choice of travel both domestically and internationally. 
However, the plan has a funding gap of €400 million from the estimated €1 billion total cost, while EU regulation 
does not allow the state to step in and invest in the venture. The Italian press has talked about interest by the 
transport group Atlantia to join the consortium, although there is no official proposal submitted. Share on Facebook

Apr 29, 2019( Kerry Underwood: http://kerryunderwood.wordpress.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  This piece, in 
slightly different form, first appeared on the Practical Law Dispute Resolution Blog. The matters dealt with in this 
piece are examined in great detail in my three volume, 1,300 page book Personal Injury Small Claims, Portals and 
Fixed Costs - price 50 and available from Underwoods Solicitorshere[1]. Kerry Underwood offers consultancy 
services in relation to this and other matters and details arehere[2]. Even though we have had 300 years of case 
law, there is still great uncertainty about the extent of solicitors' liens, a subject which has become of much greater 
importance since the legalization of Conditional Fee Agreements and the virtual abolition of civil legal aid, as 
solicitors are now often acting on credit for clients throughout the whole case, rather than billing monthly, or having 
the security of legal aid. Solicitors need the protection of a lien over damages in order to get their costs; otherwise 
we will stop acting for people who cannot afford to pay money on account. This was accepted by the Supreme 
Court in Gavin Edmondson Solicitors v Haven Insurance Co Ltd [2018] UKSC 21[3] and many of us thought that 
that was that. 
However, the Court of Appeal, in a curious decision, to put it mildly, has sought to distinguish that decision, but for 
all intents and purposes has declined to follow a very recent Supreme Court decision. The relevant decision is Bott 
... Solicitors Ltd v Ryanair DAC [2019] EWCA Civ 143 (12 February 2019)[4]. Bott ... Solicitors Limited has applied 
to the Supreme Court for permission to appeal in what is a case of significant public importance concerning 
consumer protection. Contrary to what the Court of Appeal may think, allowing clients more easily to cheat their 
solicitors, and that is what we are talking about, will simply lead to a refusal by the legal profession to act on credit. 
In other words solicitors will insist on money or security on account, and very it will be those of limited means who 
will be denied access to justice. One of the key flaws in the reasoning and logic of the Court of Appeal in applying a 
common law principle in the Ryanair case is its apparent failure to understand the movement in the last 20 years, 
sanctioned by Parliament, effectively to force parties in potential litigation to take pre-action steps to attempt 
settlement rather than issue proceedings. This is reflected in the Pre-Action Protocols, which now cover every 
single type of civil action in England and Wales, together with the more formal portal structure for low value 
personal injury claims. If the Court of Appeal's decision is allowed to stand then solicitors will find themselves 
denied the protection of the equitable lien for the costs of work done in the pre-action period, even where such work 
is expressly contemplated by the retainer, and is required by the Pre-Action Protocol approved by Parliament. The 
decision is a nonsense, and a dangerous anti-consumer nonsense which can be summarised in the old expression 
that the law, like the Ritz, is open to everyone. I deal in detail below with the Ryanair case. I also deal with the West 
London Law case where, in another strange decision, the High Court refused a solicitor a lien in a legally-aided 
LIENS: A NEVER-ENDING SAGA
case. Thus in 2019 we have already had a Court of Appeal decision and a High Court decision refusing liens, in 
spite of the Supreme Court's decision in Gavin Edmondson last year. I also look at the question of direct/public 
access barristers and liens. Solicitors Denied Lien; The Ryanair Case In Bott ... Solicitors Ltd v Ryanair DAC [2019] 
EWCA Civ 143 (12 February 2019)[5] the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's decision that Ryanair was 
entitled to respond directly to passengers seeking compensation through solicitors, and had no liability to pay 
solicitors who had assisted in the claims. Since the High Court ruling the Supreme Court had given judgment in 
Gavin Edmondson Solicitors Ltd v Haven Insurance Co Ltd [2018] UKSC 21[6] . The High Court Judge here had 
been bound by Meguerditchian v Lightbound [1917] 2 KB 298 to hold that mere negotiation by a solicitor resulting in 
recovery for a client could not give rise to a lien, but rather there had to be some form of proceedings, litigation or 
arbitration, but in Gavin Edmondson the Supreme Court had said that the fact that no proceedings had been issued 
was not fatal to the equitable right of the solicitor. Here the Court of Appeal said that the distinction between cases 
with or without proceedings could not survive the decision of the Supreme Court in Gavin Edmondson, and the 
boundary had shifted. The key to fixing the boundary was to examine why equity will recognise a solicitor's right to 
be paid and the courts had stated that access to justice lay behind the development of the principle. Here, the Court 
of Appeal said that although formal proceedings were no longer necessary, the solicitor's services must still be 
recognisable as litigation services, promoting access to justice. This would include conducting litigation or 
contemplating litigation and would encompass proceedings under various protocols, such as the portal process as 
in Gavin Edmondson. However, the Court of Appeal found that the flight compensation claim scheme was largely 
mechanical and formulaic and did not constitute litigation services required to promote access to justice. The Court 
of Appeal held that passengers are entitled to use third parties to assist with their claim, but must go to the Ryanair 
claims process in the first instance. In Gavin Edmondson the Supreme Court said: '58. It is simply wrong in my view 
to seek to distil from those cases a general principle that equity will protect solicitors from any unconscionable 
interference with their expectations in relation to recovery of their charges.' Here the Court of Appeal quoted from 
the Supreme Court's decision at Paragraph 1 setting out the basis of the court's recognition of a solicitor's lien: 'It is 
a judge-made remedy, motivated not by any fondness for solicitors as fellow lawyers or even as officers of the 
court, but rather because it promotes access to justice. Specifically it enables solicitors to offer litigation services on 
credit to clients who, although they have a meritorious case, lack the financial resources to pay up front for its 
pursuit. It is called a solicitor's lien because solicitors used to have a virtual monopoly on the pursuit of litigation in 
the higher courts. Nothing in this judgment should be read as deciding whether the relaxation of that monopoly 
means that the lien is still limited only to solicitors.' Although this is an equitable remedy, the Court of Appeal 
considered that the statutory definitions of litigation captured the essence of the principle underpinning the right to a 
lien. The court quoted section 119 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 which defines 'litigation services' as 
'any services which it would be reasonable to expect a person who is exercising, or contemplating exercising, a 
right to conduct litigation in relation to any proceedings, or any contemplated proceedings, to provide.'  In section 87 
of the Solicitors Act 1974, 'contentious business' is defined as: 'business done in or for the purposes of proceedings 
begun before a court or arbitrator'. The Court of Appeal said that this would include proceedings under one of the 
many protocols that now exist, as well, potentially, Alternative Dispute Resolution, and the court made the point that 
ADR by definition only comes into play when there is a dispute to resolve. Here, the Court of Appeal said that 
unless and until Ryanair refuses a claim, there is no dispute. In Gaynor v Central West London Buses Ltd. [2006] 
EWCA Civ 1120[7] Dyson LJ said at [17]: 'In my judgment, 'contemplated proceedings' are proceedings of which it 
can be said that there is at least a real likelihood that they will be issued. Until the potential defendant disputes the 
claim, it is not possible to say that proceedings are contemplated. Advising a client as to whether he or she has a 
good prima facie case and writing a letter of claim are not enough to amount to litigation services.' The Court of 
Appeal here went onto say: '58. The making of a claim under Regulation 261 is largely mechanical and formulaic. It 
requires little more than the flight distance and the length of the delay, in addition to details of the ticket purchase. 
The amount of compensation that a delayed passenger is entitled to receive is fixed by the Regulation. It is not a 
case in which the quantum of damages has to be evaluated. Bott's evidence is that the 'vast majority' of claims do 
not require the issue of court proceedings; and it claims a 99 per cent success rate. I do not consider that the 
services provided by Bott in processing that vast majority can be said either to be 'litigation services' of the kind that 
Lord Briggs must have had in mind; or to be required in order to promote access to justice, unless and until Ryanair 
disputes a claim. In addition, to recognise the existence of an equitable right would place a solicitor in a far more 
privileged position than a claims handler performing the same services. I cannot see any justification for that; 
especially since the rationale for the equitable right is not motivated by any fondness for solicitors. If a claim is 
LIENS: A NEVER-ENDING SAGA
disputed, different considerations will arise. 59. In my judgment, therefore, where Bott simply writes a letter of claim 
or assists a client to complete the on-line form, and the claim is paid in response to the letter or the form, it is not 
entitled to an interest in the compensation that equity will protect. I would reject this ground of appeal.' Comment  
The Senior Judiciary needs to think through rather more carefully the whole issue of access to justice and litigation 
and how it may be delivered. At one level, lawyers are being encouraged to use portals and follow protocols and do 
everything to avoid litigation, and yet Bott ... Solicitors Limited appear to be being punished for using such a 
scheme, and for making significant profits from it. What on earth is the relevance to the legal principles of the fact 
that Bott's income from claims against Ryanair was over 100,000 a month? (see Paragraph 16 of the judgment). 
What is the relevance of the number of claims that Bott were handling, except to show the success of the scheme 
and the attraction to members of the public? So, at one level, we are consistently urged to be efficient and be a 
business, with the provision of legal services opened up to every Tom, Dick and Harry, but when a firm does exactly 
that they are punished by the courts by being refused a lien. I can see no logical difference between the pre-action 
road traffic portal, where 99% of cases are settled, and the scheme operated by Bott ... Solicitors Limited. This 
decision should be overturned by the Supreme Court. No Solicitor's Lien Where Client Legally-Aided  In West 
London Law Ltd v Sandhu [2019] EWHC 828 (7 March 2019)[8] an appeal against a conditional striking-out order, 
the High Court Judge held that claimant solicitors could not recover fees for work undertaken for a legally-aided 
client by invoking the court's equitable jurisdiction to intervene to protect a solicitor's equitable lien. The ruling 
highlights that a solicitor's equitable lien cannot arise in respect of legally-aided, as opposed to privately-funded 
work. West London Law Limited had acted for a legally-aided client in litigation against his son, which succeeded, 
with costs awarded to the legally-aided client. The legally-aided client died while his son's appeal was pending. The 
legally-aided client's other son, as executor, continued instructing West London Law Limited, on a fee-paying basis. 
The appeal failed and the other son was awarded costs. The two sons settled the litigation without involving their 
solicitors, and acting in person, they entered into a Tomlin order providing for assessment of the legally-aided costs. 
In the related settlement agreement, the other son gave up the right to enforce any costs orders against the first 
son. West London Law Limited claimed their costs incurred in the litigation from the two sons, contending that they 
had agreed to cheat West London Law Limited out of their costs, or to compromise the litigation, on notice of West 
London Law Limited's costs claim, without preserving West London Law Limited's rights. The court below held that 
there was a potential cause of action, citing case law including Gavin Edmondson Solicitors v Haven Insurance Co 
Ltd [2018] UKSC 21[9]),  but the Particulars of Claim lacked a 'fundamental building block': the solicitor's lien. 
Therefore, unless West London Law Limited amended its claim, it would be struck out. On appeal, the High Court 
Judge reiterated two of the requirements for a solicitor's equitable lien: the client's responsibility for the solicitor's 
charges. a fund in which the solicitor effectively claims an interest to get his fees paid, which could be cash or a 
chose in action such as a settlement agreement or court order. Since legally-aided clients have no personal liability 
for costs, no solicitor's lien could arise. The judge rejected West London Law Limited 's submission, based on obiter 
remarks of Lord Denning in Manley v The Law Society [1981] 1 WLR 335[10], that an exception existed for legally-
aided work, allowing equity to intervene even without a lien. The conditional strike-out was overturned in relation to 
the privately-funded work. The Particulars of Claim could have been clearer, but they identified the security 
sufficiently as the rights of the legally-aided client's estate to commence detailed assessment against the first son. 
Barristers' Liens  Supposing a barrister is acting as a direct/public access barrister, instructed direct by the lay 
client, without the intervention of a solicitor, and the case is won and the defendant insurance company pays the lay 
client direct. If a solicitor had been involved, then there is no doubt that the solicitor would have a lien over the 
damages, and that lien would include all of their costs, including counsel's fees, and the insurance company would 
have to pay all of the fees to the solicitor and take its chance with getting the money back from the lay client. That is 
the effect of case law dating back to 1729, most recently confirmed by the Supreme Court in Gavin Edmondson 
Solicitors v Haven Insurance Co Ltd [2018] UKSC 21[11]. However, barristers are not allowed to hold client money, 
and it is trite law that costs belong to the client. In those circumstances, I am satisfied that a direct/public access 
barrister does not have a lien, and indeed that a barrister can never have lien. I suspect that this situation has 
arisen because in allowing barristers to act direct for clients, this point was never considered. All Files Protected by 
Lien In Spencer-White v Harding Evans LLP [2017] EWCA Civ 434[12] the Court of Appeal held that, provided the 
retainer said so, a law firm was entitled to a lien over all of the files that it held in connection with that client, and not 
just the files where there were outstanding fees. In that case the Terms of Business and the Client Care Letter both 
provided that the solicitors were entitled to retain all of the client's papers and documents until any outstanding 
sums had been paid, the Court of Appeal held that that was effective and consequently the lien was not limited to 
LIENS: A NEVER-ENDING SAGA
files where there were outstanding fees. The whole topic of liens needs revisiting, and the best way of doing this will 
be to codify the law in a new section of the Solicitors Act 1974, rather than have different courts arriving at different 
conclusions on apparently the same facts, and having to trawl through 290 years of case law. [ 1]:

passengers.Read more: Ryanair staff strike in six EU countriesThe pilot unions had been in wage-increase 
negotiations in the three Scandinavian countries since March. Earlier this month, they called for 1,500 SAS pilots to 
go on strike on Friday if no breakthrough was reached."The two sides were too far apart, and there was no reason 
to believe that a compromise could be reached," the office of the National Mediator of Norway said in a statement 
cited by Reuters as it announced the breakdown of the Norwegian talks on Friday.Talks also collapsed in Denmark

chosen conflict."The airline has canceled about 70 percent of its flights, affecting over 72,000 passengers on

Apr 25, 2019( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  Easyjet has banned the 
sale of nuts on flights to help protect passengers with allergies.The airline will also ban passengers from eating nut 
products if somebody on board has an allergy to them. Nut policy among airlines differs. 
British Airways and Ryanair, ask passengers to refrain from eating peanuts if a fellow passenger has an allergy. At 
present there are no rules governing the serving of nuts during flights. A proposed UK passenger charter, which 
could include rules for protecting allergy sufferers, is currently under consultation. The plans are part of the 
government's Aviation 2050 strategy[1]. German carrier Lufthansa is among firms with a rule against serving 
peanuts on its planes. However, like most airlines, it says it cannot guarantee a nut-free environment. Outlining the 
new policy, Easyjet said: 'We recommend that passengers inform us of their allergy at the time of booking which 
enables us to pass this information onto the cabin crew operating the flight.' Passengers can also notify the airline 
during the online booking process. An overarching policy for airlines is supported by 11 year-old Josie, who would 
like to see nuts banned by all operators. Josie, from Wolviston in Stockton-on-Tees, worries about going on holiday 
due to her life-threatening nut allergy. She carries an EpiPen with her on flights but says they only delay an 
anaphylactic reaction by a few minutes. 'You cannot do anything if you are 30,000 feet in the air,' she said. Read

Apr 12, 2019( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Miglena 
Pencheva/shutterstock Over the last year, I havetraveled the world for Business Insider[1], visiting more than 20 
countries by way of more than 30 flights. In that time, I've flown economy with dozens of different airlines, including 
major US airlines likeUnited[2], flag carriers like Egypt Air and Air Astana, and budget airlines like Vueling, RyanAir, 
and Scoot. After a year of flying, I've found that my least favorite airline has been WizzAir. Though I got a cheap 
$89 ticket, I ended up spending over $125 in fees. 
Check-in and customer service were both frustrating experiences. Visit BusinessInsider.com for more stories[3].In 
my year oftraveling the world for Business Insider[4], I've visited more than 20 countries and have been on dozens 
of flights, including major US airlines, budget airlines, and flag carriers. In just the last year, I've flown United 
Airlines, Emirates Airlines, China Southern Airlines, AirAsia, Scoot Airlines, Air Astana, Vueling, XL Airlines, Egypt 
Air, Kenya Airways, and WizzAir, to name a new.My least favorite of the bunch, without a doubt, was WizzAir. It's a 
low-cost budget airline in the vein of RyanAir or Spirit Airlines. Traveling on a budget last summer, I booked an $89 
ticket from Sofia, Bulgaria to Lisbon, Portugal. That was, by far, the cheapest airfare price for the timeframe I was 
looking to travel. Read more: I've taken more than 30 flights over the past year as I've traveled the world, and one 
airline has the best entertainment system, the friendliest staff, and the best service[5] When it comes to airlines like 
WizzAir, I find that I — and, in all likelihood, many of my fellow passengers — tend to know what I'm getting myself 
into. On some level, I expect to be nickel-and-dimed. But WizzAir takes it a step further. It has more than half a 
dozen hidden fees, some of which are impossible to avoid. There's the seat selection fee[6](up to $56, depending 
on the seat); its call center fee ($68 just to call customer service); its priority boarding fee ($5-$28 to board first and 
guarantee your carry-on luggage a spot); and its "Fare Lock" fee ($3.40 to "lock in" the airfare price you see online). 
Then there's a checked bag fee (unfortunately standard for many airlines these days) that cost me $63 for a 23-
kilogram bag. There's also no avoiding the "administration fee" of $18.50. I made a rookie mistake flying WizzAir: 
attempting to check-in at the airport. WizzAir hit me with a $34 fee toprintmy boarding pass. In my mind, this was 
the most egregious of fees. I understand that many budget airlines do this to cut down on the number of employees 
they have to have at the airport to check in passengers. In some ways, it makes sense. What doesn't make sense 
is charging the fee to a passenger who has already paid for a checked bag and, thus, has to go to the check-in 
I've taken more than 30 flights over the past year as I've traveled the world for work, and there's one airline I 
would never fly again — and it comes down to t....
counter regardless. On top of that, after waiting in a 30-minute line to get to the check-in counter, customer service 
reps had me pay the boarding pass fee at another counter, which required waiting on another line. Then I had to 
return to the check-in line. I nearly missed my flight. Even if you do remember to check-in online, if the WizzAir app 
malfunctions, as happened to a luxury travel blogger at Jet-Settera, along with six other passengers on her flight, 
you will be forced to pay the fee.[7] When I was on the flight two hours later, I was unsurprised to find that snacks 
and meals cost extra — but WizzAir wouldn't even provide a cup of water for free. I bought a $3 bottle of water. By 
the end of the flight, I hadspent $126.50 on fees and extras for an $89 flight. It wasn't so cheap after all. Having 
gone through that experience, I would rather have booked a flight on a mainstream airline for $250 or even $300 to 
avoid the aggravating experience of flying through WizzAir. As I wrote back in August[8] when I took the flight, those 
extra fees that WizzAir racked up are the entire point of their business model. "Ancillary revenue" — how budget 
airlines refer to all the charges on top of the base fare — made up 39% of WizzAir's revenue in 2016. For Ryanair 
and Jet2.com, it was 27% and 26% respectively,according to IdeaWorksCompany[9]. On the bright side, the flight 
was safe and I got there on time. Business Insider reached out to WizzAir for comment but did not hear back by the 
time of publication.NOW WATCH: Here's why McDonald's Filet-O-Fish sales skyrocket in March[10]See Also: A

Shares in easyJet, Ryanair, the British Airways owner IAG and other airline stocks rose Thursday as investors 
seemed to bet on a surge in summer-vacation bookings resulting from Brexit's delay to the end of October. easyJet 
said last week that Europeans were holding off on buying plane tickets to and from the UK because of the "many 
unanswered questions surrounding Brexit." The Brexit delay is just a temporary reprieve for easyJet, as it assumed 
"a more certain Brexit outlook" would provide a tailwind in the six months to September. 
Watch easyJet trade live[1]. European airline stocks climbed Thursday as investors seemed to bet that a delayed 
Brexit would spark a surge in summer bookings. Shares in easyJet, Ryanair, and the British Airways owner IAG all 
rose by 4% to 8%. Wizz Air and the Jet2 owner Dart Group also rose 2%, while the travel group TUI's stock jumped 
6%. The European Union on Wednesday evening extended the deadline for Britain's exit from the bloc, previously 
scheduled for Friday, to the end of October. "European airlines have rallied as the risk of a Brexit-related demand 
shock recedes," the Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Robin Byde told Business Insider in an email. "The planned delay to 
Brexit also protects airline revenues through the crucial summer season." The rebound came at the right time for 
easyJet, which warned last week[2] that Europeans were holding off on booking their summer vacations because of 
the "many unanswered questions surrounding Brexit." Hesitant travelers depressed easyJet's ticket sales and 
pushed its seat prices down about 7% in the six months to March, prompting the group to adopt a more cautious 
outlook for the summer. Its shares dropped by one-tenth on the news and dragged rivals stocks down with them. 
UK Prime Minister Theresa May's agreed extension of the Brexit deadline to October 31[3] may well be the 
sunshine needed for Europeans to book their summer flights, but it could represent only a temporary parting in the 
clouds. easyJet had guided toward revenue per seat rising in the six months to September — after it shrunk more 
than 7% in the first half — partly over an "assumption of a more certain Brexit outlook." Given the lack of a 
resolution, it can no longer make that assumption.NOW WATCH: The founder and CIO of $12 billion Ariel

Apr 08, 2019( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  REUTERS/Eric 
Gaillard Over the last year, I havetraveled the world for Business Insider[1], visiting more than 20 countries by way 
of more than 30 flights. In that time, I've flown economy with dozens of different airlines, including major US airlines 
like United[2], flag carriers like Egypt Air and Air Astana, and budget airlines like Vueling, RyanAir, and Scoot. After 
a year of flying, I've found that my favorite airline I've flown has been Emirates Airlines, thanks to its roomy planes, 
excellent service and entertainment options, and good food. It tends to be slightly more expensive than other 
options, but I've found that the comfort is worth it. 
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[3]. In my year of traveling the world for Business Insider[4], I've 
visited more than 20 countries and have been on dozens of flights, including major US airlines, budget airlines, and 
flag carriers. In just the last year, I've flown United Airlines, Emirates Airlines, China Southern Airlines, China 
Eastern Airlines, AirAsia, Scoot Airlines, Air Astana, Vueling, XL Airlines, Egypt Air, Etihad Airways, Royal Air 
Maroc, Kenya Airways, Precision Air, Air France, Austrian Airlines, Ural Airlines, Tus Air, Cobalt Air, and WizzAir, 
among others. My favorite of the bunch, without a doubt, was Emirates Airlines. For me, a great flight comes down 
to a few simple things: helpful and friendly service, timeliness, and new planes. While many airlines I flew over the 
last year matched up in one or more of those areas, only Emirates delivered across the board. To start with, 
Emirates' fleet is made up exclusively of Airbus A380s — the largest and most expensive commercial[5] airliner in 
history — and Boeing 777s. The airline's average plane age is only 6.2 years old[6], according to AirFleets. That 
means no matter what route you are on, you are flying on a relatively new and roomy plane. Both flights I took on 
Emirates were on A380s, leaving me with tons of legroom for an economy flight. The added benefit: Because the 
plane is so large — it can hold up to 800 people — the plane was only half full, which meant there was an empty 
seat next to me.The staff is friendly and helpfulOn both my flights, the flight attendants were always willing to help. 
In particular, on my second flight (my first time trying out business class[7]), the flight attendants came around to 
offer things I didn't even know I wanted. More than that, though, they were personable. They took the time to chat 
with passengers and get to know them. It made the flight fun in a way I'd never experienced before.While Emirates 
is ranked only 19th in the world[8]in punctuality among mainstream airlines, it is currently ranked second in the 
Middle East — and it's improving. It ranked fourth last year. I experienced no late arrivals during my flights.The in-
I've taken more than 30 flights over the past year as I've traveled the world, and one airline has the best 
entertainment system, the friendliest staff, and the....
flight entertainment system is top-notchMeanwhile, the proprietary entertainment system, nicknamed ICE, was 
excellent. The entertainment options were extensive. There are over 1,800 channels of movies, television, and 
games, including most "Marvel," "Jurassic Park," and "Mission Impossible" films. There were also films from just 
about every world region, as well as the information channel with the latest headlines and articles from BBC 
News.Emirates consistently wins best in-flight entertainment system[9]year after year. It makes sense why when 
you use it.Emirates doesn't skimp on serviceThe only downside of the airline was the food. It's certainly not the best 
I've had on an airplane. That still goes to Japan Airlines, which provided tasty, fresh Japanese food.That being said, 
with airline after airline cutting back on meals and other goodies, Emirates goes a long way to show respect to its 
customers by not skimping on meals and handing out goodies like eye masks, headphones, earplugs, and socks on 
long-haul flights. Prior to flying Emirates, I wondered what the big fuss was. Now that I've flown it twice, there's no 
airline I'd be more stoked to fly again.NOW WATCH: Scientists completed one of the most detailed explorations

Apr 03, 2019( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair 
has become the first noncoal company to join Europe's top 10 carbon emitters. The Irish airliner is "the new coal," 
one expert said.Low-budget airline Ryanair was the EU's ninth-highest corporate carbon emitter in 2018, according 
to research by think tank Transport and Environment (T...and based on data from the EU's emissions trading 
system registry.The Irish company, which transports 130 million people a year, declared 9.9 megatons of 
greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in 2018, up 6.9 percent on 2017 and up 49 percent since 2013.Read more: 
Being a pilot isn't what it used to beThis makes it the first corporate without holdings in coal-fired power plants to 
enter the EU's top 10 most emitting firms.The most carbon-intense entity was Poland's Belchatow power station 
and coal mine, which generated 38 million megatons of GHG emissions in 2018, with the top three also including 
German coal mines Neurath and Niederaussem. German coal mines accounted for seven of the top 10.EasyJet 
was Europe's next worst-performing airline, in 31st place, with an 11 percent rise in emissions in 2018. It was 
followed by Lufthansa, Norwegian and British Airways.The new coal"When it comes to climate, Ryanair is the new 
coal," Andrew Murphy, the aviation manager at the European Federation for Transport and Environment, said."This 
trend will only continue until Europe realizes that this under-taxed and under-regulated sector needs to be brought 
into line, starting with a tax on kerosene and the introduction of mandates that force airlines to switch to zero-
emission jet fuel."Ryanair dismisses claimsA Ryanair spokesperson said "Ryanair is Europe's greenest and 
cleanest airline."He claimed the company is the "greenest and cleanest airline" in the EU, due to the fact that it has 
the lowest CO2 emissions per kilometer traveled per passenger of any airline across the bloc.Ryanair's chief 
executive, Michael O'Leary, dismissed climate change issues as "complete and utter rubbish" in an interview in 
2017.Coal entities' emissions down, airlines upCoal entities' CO2 footprint is falling, though, as Europe's shift to 
cleaner energy ramps up. 
But airlines, which are exempted from fuel taxes and VAT on tickets, have seen a rise of 26.3 percent since 2014, 
faster than all other transport sectors.Europe's airlines pay about €800 million ($888 million) a year for their right to 
pollute. Some studies suggest this sum is dwarfed by the €27 billion they would have to pay if their fuel tax and VAT 
exemptions were lifted.The sector receives up to 85 percent of its EU emissions trading allowances free, with 
Ryanair consequently saving €96.6 million in 2018.Read more: Icelandic budget airline WOW ceases 
operationsAviation is responsible for about 3 percent of Europe's GHG emissions, but industry forecasts suggest 
this could rise by up to 700 percent by 2050 as the sector grows. Recent research has also found that flights will 
generate around 43 gigatons of CO2 emissions by 2050 - more than 4 percent of the world's entire remaining 
carbon budget.Aviation is now estimated to account for 2 percent of all global carbon emissions, and 12 percent of 
the transport sector's greenhouse gas emissions.jbh/hg (Reuters, AP)

Apr 03, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
Southwest Airlines LUV[1], which has 34 Boeing 737 Max jets in its fleet, extended the grounding period of such 
jets until the end of May 2019. The low-cost carrier had earlier stated that the jets would remain grounded until Apr 
20.Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines DAL[2] unveiled a bullish adjusted earnings guidance for first-quarter 2019. Delta will 
kick-start the earnings season for airlines on Apr 10. This Atlanta, GA-based carrier also grabbed headlines by 
virtue of its decision to extend the credit card deal with American Express AXP[3] through 2029.On the traffic front, 
Delta and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] unveiled their respective traffic numbers for March.(Read the last Airline 
Stock Roundup here[5]).Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Southwest Airlines will release a new 
flight schedule for May. This followed the joint announcement with Southwest Airlines Pilots' Association ('SWAPA') 
that Boeing 737 MAX jets will not operate at Southwest Airlines until the end of May 2019. (Read more: Southwest 
Calls Off 737 MAX Operations Through May-End[6]).2. For first-quarter 2019, Delta expects adjusted earnings per 
share in the 85-95 cents band, higher 70-90 cents projected earlier. 
The mid-point (90 cents) of the guided range is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents. Also, pre-tax 
margin is expected between 7% and 8% (past outlook: 6.5-8.5%).Moreover,it expects the top line to rise 
approximately 7%. Total unit revenues (TRASM) are anticipated to inch up approximately 2% (prior view was an 
increase in the 0-2% range). The upside can be primarily attributed to healthy corporate-travel demand. Also, the 
contract extension between Delta and American Express has aided first-quarter TRASM to the tune of 1 point.The 
company's non-fuel unit costs have also improved backed by better completion factor and costs control measures. 
The metric is now envisioned to be either flat or to increase up to 0.5% (previous view was an increase of 1-
2%).Average fuel price is estimated between $2.03 and $2.08 per gallon. Additionally, effective tax rate is projected 
to be 23-24% for the March quarter. Capacity is estimated to rise approximately 5% year over year in the soon-to-
be-reported quarter.On a separate note, Delta's consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), 
increased 5.3% year over year. Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) climbed 5.4% on a year-over-
year basis. Consolidated load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) contracted 20 basis points (bps) to 86.7% as 
capacity expansion exceeded traffic growth.Delta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of 
today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7].3. At Ryanair, March traffic (including 0.4 million from its 
LaudaMotion unit) rose 9% year over year to 10.9 million. Moreover, load factor increased to 96% from 95% a year 
ago. In March, this European low-cost carrier operated more than 59,800 scheduled flights.4. Operations at leading 
U.S.-based carriers like Southwest Airlines, Delta, United Airlines — the wholly owned subsidiary of United 
Continental Holdings UAL[8] — and Alaska Air Group ALK[9] were briefly disrupted on the morning of Apr 1, 2019,

due to a technical glitch. The issue, which has now been resolved, resulted in flight delays across the country. The 
system-wide outages were reportedly[10] caused due to a software problem at Aerodata — a provider of 
information related to aircraft weight and balance.5. Hawaiian Airlines — the wholly owned subsidiary of Hawaiian 
Holdings HA[11] — is constantly working to modernize its fleet in a bid to improve its passengers' flying experience. 
In a fleet-related development, the carrier announced the names of its partners (Adient Aerospace and Collins 
Aerospace) for designing seats of Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft. The jet is scheduled to join Hawaiian Airlines' 
fleet in 2021.Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past 
week and during the last six months.The table above shows all airline stocks gained in the past week. Shares of 
Delta have appreciated the most (9.6%) driven by its bullish guidance. The NYSE ARCA Airline index increased 
3.6% in the period. Over the course of six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline index declined 0.1%.What's Next in the

Mar 27, 2019( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  A Ryanair attempt to make 
fun of British Airways on Twitter after a flight mistakenly went to Edinburgh instead of Düsseldorf has 
backfired.Ryanair's official Twitter account said[1] it had a 'present' for BA - a copy of Geography for Dummies. But 
Twitter users made a number of suggestions of books Ryanair could read, including 'Customer Service for 
Dummies'. In January Ryanair was again named the UK's least-liked short-haul airline[2]. On Monday, a British 
Airways flight that was supposed to go to Germany[3] ended up in Scotland after the wrong flight plan was 
used.Hey @British_Airways[4], we have a present for you pic.twitter.com/m3K9ZNk0Ew[5]; — Ryanair (@Ryanair) 
March 25, 2019[6]Ryanair trolled BA in a tweet that afternoon with the suggested reading material. BA replied to the 
tweet saying: 'No-one is perfect'. But Twitter users quickly came back with book suggestions lampooning the low-
cost airline, including 'Employment Law for Dummies'. In 2018 Ryanair was forced to cancel hundreds of flights 
after strike action by pilots and staff who were complaining about conditions. 
The strikes caused disruption for tens of thousands of passengers[7]. In December 2018 the Civil Aviation Authority 
began legal action against Ryanair after it refused to pay compensation to passengers[8] over the cancelled and 
delayed flights.Diverted flightsAnother commentator, Richard Spaven, referenced a story that first appeared in the 
Independent on 6 January about a Ryanair flight bound for Thessaloniki[9] in Greece. The flight was diverted more 
than 500 miles away to Timisoara in northwest Romania. Passengers were then offered transport on an 'old bus' to 
complete the journey, which many refused, the Independent reported. Eventually the Greek government sent an 
aircraft to fly the remaining passengers in. Many Twitter users poked fun at Ryanair over its practice of flying to 
airports that are some way from the supposed destination, for example, flying to Beauvais, which is more than 50 
miles north of Paris, instead of a closer airport to the French capital. Twitter user Wayne Kavanagh asked Ryanair 
how much it was charging BA for the book 'because you not giving it away for free', a reference to Ryanair's habit of 
charging customers extra, for example, to print boarding passes. In January Ryanair was named the UK's least-
liked short-haul airline for the sixth year running after a survey by consumer group Which?.here a book for ryanair i 
just gonna charge them 100 a page pic.twitter.com/05nREY4A7U[10]; — jasedizzle05 (@smilemorefamily) March 
26, 2019[11]Passengers were not impressed by industrial action, boarding processes, seat comfort, food and drink, 
and cabin environment, the consumer group said. At the time, Ryanair said passenger numbers had grown 80% in 
the previous six years, and that reflected what people want 'much more than an unrepresentative survey of just 
8,000 
people.'

Mar 26, 2019( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Andy Cross/The 
Denver Post via Getty Images/Business Insider A British Airways plane accidentally landed in Scotland instead of 
Germany on Monday, sparking surprise and derision online. Although the vast majority of flights land at the right 
destination, it is not totally unheard of. An Associated Press analysis[1] found at least 150 flights by US carriers 
alone landed or started to land in the wrong airport between the early 1990s and 2014. Errors included landing in 
the wrong airport in the right city, and sometimes the complete wrong country. Human error is the main cause. 
A main reason is that most airports look alike, one pilot said: "Humans often see what they expect to see, even 
when it is wrong." Passengers on a British Airways flight this Monday from London to Düsseldorf, Germany, were 
shocked when an announcement welcomed them instead to Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland. British Airways (BA) 
apologized to the customers who accidentally ended up [2]525 miles from their destination[3]. German firm WDL 
Aviation, which was running the BA-branded flight, told Business Insider that it is still investigating what went wrong. 
The story went viral, partly because of how unusual it seemed. But flights accidentally landing in the wrong airport, 
country, or even continent, is more common than you might think. Read more: A British Airways flight from London 
to Germany took off in the wrong direction and landed in Scotland, 525 miles from its destination[4] An Associated 
Press analysis[5] of flight records found that at least 150 flights by US carriers alone landed or started to land in the 
wrong place between the early 1990s and 2014. The review did not cover diversions because of emergencies, like 
faults with the plane or medical incidents on board.This typically happens because of human error. For example, 
when a Delta flight landed in the wrong Minneapolis airport in 2017, the official investigation concluded[6] it was 
because the pilot had not flown that route a lot, and got confused. And the investigation[7] into a lost 2015 Air Asia 
flight found that the pilot "inadvertently" put in the wrong coordinates for his flight. Instead of going from Sydney, 
Australia to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the pilot put in coordinates in South Africa and ended up coming back to 
Australia, landing in Melbourne.And, if you go back far enough, you can find cases where the planes ended up in 
the wrong continent. Aviator Douglas Corrigan took off for a solo trip from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in 1938, only to 
end up in Dublin[8], Ireland, after a whole night in the air. Read more: Ryanair offered a 'Geography for Dummies' 
book to British Airways after it accidentally flew a plane to Scotland instead of Germany[9] Some airlines found that 
it can be dangerous to take the moral high ground on getting the right destination. Ryanair mockingly offered a copy 
of "Geography for Dummies" to British Airways after its accidental detour, only for Twitter users to point out[10] 
some 
of 
its 
own 
past 
flight 
diversions.Tweet

present for you pic.twitter.com/m3K9ZNk0Ew[12] Pilots can land in the wrong airport because of administrative 
errors, of simply because they look the same;British Airways said that the diversion was an accident caused by 
paperwork for the flight being filed incorrectly, a possibility WDL said it would investigate. But pilots sometimes land 
in the wrong airport for a simpler reason: many airports look the same. The Flight Safety Foundation warned[13] of 
cases where an error in the pilot's visual perception meant that the plane landed in the wrong place. It found 
examples where flight crews thought they were arriving at the correct airport because of its appearance. In 
November 2013, a plane landed in the wrong Kansas airport because the flight crews thought the runways looked 
similar. In December 2013 a plane landed in the wrong Missouri airport for the same reason.  The foundation said 
that both aircraft crews were flying at night and with decent visibility and "thought they saw the correct airport and 
runway." Pilot John Cox told USA Today [14]that pilots can land at the wrong airport as "humans often see what 
they expect to see, even when it is wrong." "In some cases, the crew visually sees a runway and believes it is the 
runway of intended landing. Confirmation bias helps them accept evidence supporting their belief and discount 
evidence contrary to it."The US National Transport Safety Board warns pilots[15] that it is easy to land at the wrong 
airport because they look similar and that pilots need "adequate preparation, robust monitoring, and cross-checking 
of position using all available resources." It tells pilots to become familiar with the airport's layout and features that 
make it stand out, and to "confirm that you have correctly identified the destination airport before reporting the 
airport or runway is in sight." One former Air Force pilot who teaches aviation safety told The Atlantic[16] how easy 
it is for pilots to see a runway and assume their automated navigation devices are faulty. "You've got these runway 
lights, and you are looking at them, and they're saying: 'Come to me, come to me. I will let you land.' They're like 
the sirens of the ocean."NOW WATCH: Take a closer look at Bugatti's $19 million La Voiture Noire — the most

Mar 26, 2019( TheNextWeb.com: http://thenextweb.com Delivered by Newstex)  The Boeing 737 is the most 
produced commercial airplane in history[1]: over 10,000 have been built since it first flew in 1967, with thousands 
more on order. Even the UK's Royal Air Force is to put them into service as the P8a Poseidon[2]. An airplane which 
flies that much will have accidents. The 737 has had over 200 that have led to the loss of the airplane, resulting in 
over 5,000 fatalities[3] over its 51 years. But statistically, this nonetheless is a very safe airplane. 
In the newer 'Next Generation' 737, you'd have to take about a million flights to reach a 25% chance of being 
present at a 'hull loss' accident ('hull loss' doesn't even mean fatalities, just that the airplane is beyond economic 
repair[4]). By comparison, the British annual average for road traffic fatalities is 13 per million inhabitants[5]. In 
Britain, which has some of the world's safest roads, your chance of dying as a car passenger per year are about 
four times greater than being in a serious accident if you fly in a Boeing 737 every month.EvolutionUnsurprisingly, 
the Boeing 737, which has been with us for nearly half the time powered flight has existed, has seen many 
upgrades. The first model - the 737-100 - arrived in 1967, while the 737 MAX series entered service in 2016. So far, 
nearly 
400 
of 
the 
MAX 
aircraft 
have 
been 
delivered 
and 
over 
5,000 
ordered.

explained-by-an-aircraft-expert/#One of the earliest models, a Boeing 737-200, when it was in service with Ryanair. 
Guy Brian GrattonOver its lifetime, the 737 has stretched from 29 meters to 44 meters long, fuel capacity has risen 
from 14.7 tonnes to 21.3 tonnes, and passenger seats have increased from 118 to 230. With these developments 
have come demands for greater safety[6], reduced noise, particulate and greenhouse gas emissions[7], and lower 
running costs. So while all 737s are certified as a single airplane type[8], the changes have been massive. Most 
recently, the big push has been to reduce fuel consumption. For both economic and environmental reasons, this led 
to the latest 737 MAX 8[9] models - along with the competitor Airbus A320 Neo[10] - being fitted with new, larger 
and more efficient CFM Leap[11] engines. These must be mounted higher and further forward than previously, 
creating a handling problem that wasn't unique to this airplane, but had to be addressed.

explained-by-an-aircraft-expert/#One of the newer Boeing 737s, a 737-800 'Next Gen' model ironically showing off 
a much older heritage livery for Dutch Airline KLM. Guy Brian Gratton SafetyAngle of attack[12] is the angle 
between the wing chord (an imaginary line between the leading and trailing edges of the wing) and the airflow. To 
generate lift, this is typically around two degrees in cruising flight. But to create lift at low airspeeds during take-off, 
Boeing 737 MAX's crashes explained by an aircraft expert
landing and some manoeuvers, it must be much higher - often more than ten degrees. If the angle of attack is too 
great, the airplane loses control - or 'stalls'[13]. This has nothing to do with stalling an engine and will usually cause 
a sudden descent. The larger, repositioned engines initially created a handling problem at a high angle of attack, 
particularly at low speeds, which could pitch the airplane nose-up into an even greater angle of attack, potentially 
worsening the loss of control. Boeing addressed this by introducing an automated system called Manoeuvering 
Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS)[14]. This automatically forces the nose down from high angles of 
attack, removing the airplane from the stall condition. It does this by rotating the tailplane, effectively changing the 
shape of the airplane. This was necessary - stalling under these circumstances has been a serious, even fatal, 
problem in some previous airliners[15]. So far so good. But then we hit a problem which is alleged to have 
contributed to the October 2018 Lion Air 737 MAX 8 crash in Indonesia[16]. While this aircraft had the MCAS 
system, the pilots allegedly didn't know about it[17]. It has been said a decision had been made not to include the 
system in pilot training[18], in particular that if the system received incorrect signals from the airplane's angle of 
attack sensors the airplane could pitch steeply nose-down into a potentially unrecoverable dive. All pilots train to 
recognize and deal with a wide range of instrument and equipment failures. On my own commercial pilots licence 
test, I had several real and simulated instrument failures, and was expected to deal with them while continuing the 
flight; all commercial pilots are reassessed on this regularly[19]. But pilots can best deal with failures they've been 
trained for. We don't yet have full reports on the Lion Air crash, nor on the more recent Ethiopian Airlines crash[20] 
of another 737 MAX. But there is growing evidence[21] that the crew didn't fully understand the MCAS system, and 
that the system could malfunction when a single instrument feeding it information fails[22]. The airplane could 
allegedly put itself into a steep dive due to an instrument failure, and the pilots perhaps weren't fully trained to 
recognize and correct for that[23].What next?In a very new aircraft type, 339 people have died in two, apparently 
similar, accidents[24] - this is intolerable. Fortunately, the aviation industry, that's mindset often goes back to the 
1950s Comet disasters[25], is extremely prompt in dealing with serious safety issues. Around the world, airplanes of 
this type were grounded[26] within a few days, and will remain so until Boeing and its stakeholders[27] find and 
certify solutions to both the aircraft control software and the pilot training issues.

1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=cliphttps://thenextweb.com/syndication/2019/03/26/boeing-737-maxs-crashes-
explained-by-an-aircraft-expert/#American budget airline giant Southwest has built its business model around the 
Boeing 737, currently operating 750 of them. The FAA[index company=FAANews] has grounded their 35 737 MAX 
airplanes. Guy Brian GrattonThese events show the aviation industry at both its best, and worst. It's right that 
manufacturers and airlines should be seeking more efficient, safer aircraft. But making progress at an acceptable 
cost could potentially risk corners being cut. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been accused 
in the past of delegating too much oversight of their own work to Boeing[28], and those of us in this community are 
concerned that when governments seek to reduce budgets, aviation authorities may not be well enough resourced 
to adequately do their jobs. Additionally, any aviation company may necessarily suffer conflict between engineers 
and pilots, whose objective is to create the best and safest product, and business managers, who must ensure 
profitability. So what now? The 737 MAX will remain grounded while Boeing develops a 'software fix' that eliminates 
this potential problem, and then works with the FAA and international authorities to certify it. There should also be 
new MCAS training that all 737 MAX pilots around the world will receive before they fly the airplane again. Indeed, 
this will hopefully also lead to a broader debate about the level of training provided to airline pilots. After these two 
tragedies there will likely be a number of court cases. The families will rightly want closure. But we also need to 
ensure that similar disasters don't happen in the future - and this involves aviation professionals working to find new 
safety solutions. Focusing too much on legal outcomes could potentially prevent the best safety outcomes from 
being pursued[29]. This article is republished from The Conversation[30]by Guy Gratton[31], Visiting professor,

Mar 25, 2019( FFT.ie: http://www.fft.ie Delivered by Newstex)  More than 25 tourism businesses joined Tourism 
Ireland and Ireland West Airport Knock in Cologne over the St Patrick's weekend, to promote the new Ryanair flight 
from Cologne to Knock, which begins in June. 
Their aim was to highlight the new route and to bring a taste of Wild Atlantic Way hospitality to travel professionals 
working in the Cologne region. Tourism Ireland arranged for businesses from Mayo, Galway, Roscommon, Leitrim, 
Sligo and Donegal to meet and do business with over 70 German travel agents at a special St Patrick's Day 
business networking event in Cologne Bonn Airport. Representatives of B...reland welcomed guests with a special 
taste of Wild Atlantic Way hospitality. Some of the group also attended the 'greening' of Cologne's Lanxess arena, 
one of the largest arenas in Europe, which took part in Tourism Ireland's Global Greening initiative for the first time. 
Tourism Ireland's spring activity in Germany includes a TV campaign on a range of channels such as ARD and 
RTL, as well as co-operative activity with travel partners. Commenting on the visit, Tourism Ireland's Head of 
Mainland Europe, Finola O'Mahony said: 'Germany is an important and growing tourism market, which delivered 
over 750,000 visitors to Ireland last year. Our aim is to generate further growth in 2019 and years to come and, in 
particular, to encourage more visitors to explore the regions and less-visited areas. This new service will help us 
deliver on that objective.'

Mar 11, 2019( ACTmedia News: http://actmedia.eu Delivered by Newstex)  The 16 airports in Romania have posted 
a 7.9 percent increase in passenger numbers last year up to 21.8 million, an all-time high due to international 
flights, while domestic passenger traffic slightly increased, according to figures released by the National Institute of 
Statistics (INS). Total passenger numbers on the Romanian airports have increased from 20.22 million in 2017 to 
21.82 million in 2018. International passenger traffic rose by 8.6 percent last year, to 18.98 million, and the number 
of passengers carried with domestic flights increased by 3.3 percent, to 2.84 million, official data show. Romania's 
biggest airport, Henri Coand?
 International Airport (Otopeni), controlled by the state-owned Aeroporturi Bucure?ti company (CNAB), posted an 
increase of its total passenger traffic by 7.9 percent last year to an all-time high of 13.82 million. The second airport 
in Romania by passenger traffic is Cluj Napoca International Airport, with 2.78 million passengers in 2018 (+3.9 
percent compared to 2017), followed by Timi?oara International Airport (1.52 million, -6.4 percent) and Ia?i 
International Airport (1.25 million, +9.4 percent). In 2017, Romanian airports have posted a 23.3 percent increase in 
passenger numbers, to 20.2 million, a all-time high due to both international and domestic flights. Airport passenger 
numbers have soared in Romania in the last few years due to income rise, cheap flights offered by low-cost 
companies and poor infrastructure across the country. In the last couple of years, low-cost companies like Wizz Air, 
Blueair and Ryanair entered domestic flights market in Romania, controlled for years by the state-owned Tarom, 
trying to benefit from rising appetite for flights between the large urban areas. But lack of investments in expanding 
airports capacity is already affecting passenger's comfort, especially in Henri Coand? International Airport.

shareholders on a no-deal Brexit, the airline says. British citizens own stick in Ryanair will be unable to vote on 
company resolutions or attend AGMs, while they will also be prevented from acquiring additional shares. European 
Union regulations dictate that airlines operating under a European licence must be majority-owned and controlled 
by shareholders from the EU. And that means curtailing the rights of British shareholders to align them with other 
non-EU investors. If UK shareholders wish to sell the shares after a no-deal Brexit, they will only be allowed to sell 
them to EU nationals.

Why Virgin Atlantic 's new makeup policy is mostly concealer and gloss

Mar 09, 2019( Phil's Stock World: http://www.philstockworld.com Delivered by Newstex)  Why Virgin Atlantic's new 
makeup policy is mostly concealer and gloss   Shutterstock[1]  Courtesy ofPhilip Hancock[2], University of Essex[3] 
and Melissa Tyler[4], University of Essex[5] The airline Virgin Atlantic has decided[6] that female cabin crew will no 
longer be required to wear makeup during flights. They will also be offered the option of wearing trousers as part of 
their standard uniform allocation rather than only on request. According to one Virgin executive, the move will 
'provide our team with more choice on how they want to express themselves'. That companies like Virgin continue 
to operate different policies for men and women might have come as a shock to those who assumed that 
discriminatory dress codes were a thing of the past. Yet research attests[7] to the continuing aesthetic expectations 
governing the recruitment, selection, supervision and management of airline cabin crew. 
In fact, makeup policies are just the tip of the iceberg. Height-weight regulations, grooming manuals and gender 
differentiated uniform requirements are the industry standard - especially among airlines flying lucrative business 
travel routes. British Airways for instance, continues to require female cabin crew to wear makeup, and only allowed 
them to wear trousers[8] in 2016. And while 'no frills' airlines tend to be more relaxed about rules on appearance, 
Ryanair only stopped producing[9] its calendar featuring bikini clad female crew in 2015. Virgin Atlantic 
demonstrated the importance of women's bodies to its brand image a decade ago, in its 25th anniversary 
advertising campaign: Still Red Hot. Despite reducing the high levels of skill and training required of cabin crew to a 
retro-styled ode to the 'trolley dolly', the advert won industry accolades[10] and much praise on social media. Play 
Video[11]  The actual demands of the job - ensuring the safety and security of passengers, taking control of safe 
evacuation in the event of an emergency - are often forgotten. Meanwhile, the Virgin Atlantic Sindy doll and the Ann 
Summers flight attendant costume, demonstrate how the sexualisation of female cabin crew remains firmly encoded 
in popular consciousness. One of the many problems with this is that making an employee's appearance your 
business transforms him or her (and it is disproportionately 'her') into a spectacle. This effectively means they are 
working two jobs: the job itself, and the sexualised theatre of the job. An aesthetic economy depends upon (again, 
predominantly young women) aspiring to this. This means that the desire to be seen, to dress up, to 'stage oneself' 
forms a practically limitless basis for exploitation and profit accumulation. Hence, like so many people (again 
disproportionately women) working double shifts, female cabin crew are relatively underpaid, enticed by the 
glamorous veneer of an industry characterised by low pay and high levels of sexual harassment. And while Virgin 
may have updated its makeup rules, its gender pay gap[12] from figures published in 2018 suggest a median 
average hourly rate for women of 28% below that of their male colleagues. Women also count for 81% of the 
employees in the company's lowest pay quartile[13]. Flying the flag for equality? A Virgin spokesperson applauded 
Why Virgin Atlantic 's new makeup policy is mostly concealer and gloss
the change of makeup policy as 'significant' in an industry in which female crew are expected to invest considerable 
time and resources in maintaining the prescribed appearance, 'adding to the costs and unpaid labour' associated 
with their jobs. Arguably this move is significant in so far as it formally recognises the centrality of this aesthetic 
aspect of the work involved. Certainly, incremental developments such as changes to uniform and grooming 
regulations are important formal steps towards addressing this. But they need to be understood in relation to two 
other important industry-wide factors. First, such changes have to be set against the wider historical context - a 
change in policy will never be enough on its own to offset the impact of years of discriminatory employment 
practices, and their wider ramifications for women across the industry and labour market. Second, while changes to 
formal policies are all well and good, they are arguably undermined by the very powerful visual images on corporate 
websites and advertising campaigns. These send out a clear and persistent message about who and what the 
company (and industry) values. Indeed, whatever commitment to equality Virgin may or may not have wanted to 
make was quickly unravelled by a tweet circulated immediately afterwards depicting the company's new cabin crew 
apprentices. The female contingent, identically dressed in red skirts, ruby shoes and bold crimson lipstick, 
embodied the extent to which old habits are hard to break.Today we're at the House of Commons to support the 
@ESFAgov[14] Apprenticeships, Skills and Careers for the Future event!#NAW2019[15] #BlazeATrail[16] 
#apprenticeships[17] pic.twitter.com/XFuxTZw6uN[18]; — East of England YAAN (@EofEYAAN) March 7, 2019[19] 
Reading between the lines, what Virgin wants is not for women to wear makeup, but to recruit women who want to 
wear makeup, and who aspire to embodying the corporate brand and its reified versions of feminine sexuality. For 
those women who 'choose' to wear makeup, Virgin offers a template of corporate colours and websites replete with 
'painting by numbers' photographs of cabin crew who are, presumably, highlighted as ideal examples of how to be 
the face of the company. The message is loud and clear: you don't have to look like this, but we'd really like you to. 
And more to the point, we'd like it to be not because it is what we want, but what you want. As a mode of self-
discipline this makes the policy much more effective - Virgin is able to recruit only those people who want to 
embody the corporate brand, as it is narrowly defined yet ubiquitously, idealistically depicted. And as industry 
leaders, other airlines emulate this as an ideal to aspire to. The decision to allow female employees to go makeup 
free is a welcome development, but it is a baby step. What is really needed is a great big leap of faith towards the 
seemingly radical idea that people's worth might relate to more than how they look. Philip Hancock[20], Professor of

Mar 06, 2019( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  AP Through recent 
mergers, airlines[1] such as American[2], Delta[3], and United[4] have grown to become colossal mega-carriers. 
Recently, aviation data firm OAG[5] provided us with data sets that ranked the 20 largest airlines in the world based 
on the number of seats each carrier made available to passengers during 2018. As expected, US carriers made a 
strong showing with American, Delta, United, Southwest[6], and Alaska Airlines[7] all in the top 20. Low-cost 
carriers Ryanair[8], EasyJet[9], and IndiGo[10] all placed in the top 20. Other international carriers to make the list 
include Emirates[11], Air China[12], China Eastern[13], China Southern[14], Lufthansa[15], Turkish Airlines[16], 
ANA[17], LATAM[18], British Airways[19], Air France[20], Air Canada[21], and Aeroflot[22]. Over the past century, 
the airline industry has changed the way humans travel. It has effectively made the world a smaller place — making 
it possible for billions of people everywhere to explore the world. According to the International Air Transport 
Association[23] (IATA), consumers spent an estimated $871 billion or roughly 1% of the global GDP on air travel. 
The trade group, whose membership is made up of 290 airlines, expects [24]the total number of airline passengers 
around the world to reach 8.2 billion people by 2037— that's double today's passenger count. As a result of the 
industry's growth, many of the world's airlines have become household names. Through recent mergers, American, 
Delta, United, and Southwest have grown to become colossal mega-carriers. Read more: The 11 longest flights in 
the world, ranked[25]. This got us at Business Insider thinking about how they stack up against the world's largest 
airlines. Fortunately, good folks at OAG were able to provide us the data sets that answered our question. The 
London-based aviation data and intelligence firm ranked the world's airlines based on the total number of seats 
each carrier made available to customers during 2018. OAG also included the total number of aircraft in each airline 
fleet. Some airlines on the list are able to offer substantially more seats while operating fewer aircraft. According to 
OAG senior analyst John Grant, the reason for this variation is due to the differences in the planes that comprise a 
carrier's fleet and the seat configurations of each aircraft. As a result, airlines that operate larger aircraft and aircraft 
with higher seat density will be able to make more seats available to customers. Here's a closer look at the 20 
biggest airlines in the world: 20. Alaska Airlines APCapacity: 54,574,295 seats. Fleet size: 233 aircraft.19. Aeroflot

Mar 05, 2019( FFT.ie: http://www.fft.ie Delivered by Newstex)  Tourism Ireland in Spain unveiled its themes for the 
Spanish market for 2019 recently, at an event in Madrid attended by over 50 travel and lifestyle journalists. 
Attendees included representatives of Cond Nast Traveller, Cosmopolitan, El Mundo and El Pas, as well as social 
influencers and Spanish travel professionals. 
There was a special focus on Northern Ireland at this year's event, with a Game of Thrones theme and 
representatives of Visit Derry in attendance. Tourism Ireland also unveiled its new Fill your Heart with Ireland 
campaign (in Spanish, 'Irlanda llega a tu corazón'). CSO figures for January 2019 indicate a positive start to the 
year, with growth of 28% in arrivals from Spain compared January 2018. 'In 2018, we welcomed around 443,000 
Spanish visitors to Ireland,' said Barbara Wood, Tourism Ireland's Manager Spain. 'Our new Fill Your Heart With 
Ireland campaign is now live, targeting Spanish travellers on popular video websites and social platforms. We are 
also rolling out a number of co-operative campaigns with partners like Aer Lingus, Ryanair, Iberia Express and 
Logitravel.' [embedded content] Tourism Ireland is placing a greater focus on driving growth to less visited 
attractions and locations, as well as on driving business in the off-peak and shoulder seasons. Around 37% of all 
Spanish visitors to Ireland arrive in the off-season months of Q1 and Q4. Tourism Ireland will roll out a digital and 
outdoor campaign with Aer Lingus during March, highlighting flights from Madrid and Barcelona to Dublin and from 
Barcelona to Cork. Tourism Ireland will partner with Ryanair, also in March, promoting flights from Madrid,

Mar 05, 2019( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  Virgin Atlantic has 
removed its long-standing requirement that female cabin crew wear make-up while on duty.Female cabin crew, 
whose uniform features a tight, red skirt, will also now be offered trousers automatically, rather than only when 
requested. It said it was a 'significant change'. Newer airlines, such as EasyJet and Ryanair, typically have relatively 
relaxed rules on uniform, but many longer-established airlines give rules on what make-up must be worn. 
The airline's first uniforms were designed by Arabella Pollen, a 23-year-old designer at the time of its launch in 
1984. She created Virgin Atlantic's 'Virgin Red'. The most recent redesign was by Vivienne Westwood in 2014. 
Virgin said cabin crew could now work without make-up, but were welcome to follow the palette of lipstick and 
foundation set out in its guidelines. Virgin Atlantic spokesman Mark Anderson said: 'Not only do the new guidelines 
offer an increased level of comfort, they also provide our team with more choice on how they want to express 
themselves at work.' The airline industry has been among the most conservative when it comes to appearance 
standards, although it is gradually changing. British Airways dropped its no-trouser rule for women in 2016, 
although it still requires female crew to wear make-up. Read more: Virgin Atlantic removes cabin crew make-up rule

Feb 23, 2019( Phil's Stock World: http://www.philstockworld.com Delivered by Newstex)  Airlines are going bust in 
droves, so why do so many people try to launch them?  'Taxi for Flybmi.' G Tipene[1]  Courtesy ofLoizos 
Heracleous[2], Warwick Business School, University of Warwick[3] Yet another airline has collapsed - this time[4] 
British operation Flybmi, costing almost 400 jobs as hundreds of flights were cancelled at short notice. It is the latest 
in a string of[5] recent European airline failures, including Air Berlin[6], Alitalia[7], Monarch[8], Primera[9], Azur[10] 
and Cobalt[11]. This is despite years of good growth[12] in worldwide air passenger demand, including[13] in 
Europe. 
So why are so many airlines going out of business? Aviation is an unattractive industry from an investor point of 
view at the best of times, notwithstanding the passenger growth. Aeroplanes are expensive assets with few 
alternative uses, which limits the ability of airlines to reduce their capacity during lean periods - compared to, say, a 
manufacturing business that can close a plant and lay off workers. Airlines also have to deal with fluctuating 
expenses like fuel, which accounts for around a third of total costs. There is also extensive regulation, combative 
unions, relatively low barriers to entry and the fact that travellers can so easily shop around. Play Video[14] The 
sector did become more profitable in the early years of this decade, but this was due to[15] lower fuel prices rather 
than any underlying improvements. When fuel prices began climbing again in 2016, airlines were[16] hit. This is 
particularly true of those like Flybmi and Monarch which were buying fuel in pounds sterling, since the currency has 
weakened[17] in the wake of the 2016 Brexit vote[18]. The political uncertainty has not helped British airlines either 
- though equally we must generally beware of companies using this as a scapegoat for bad performance. The 
future's not bright The net result is that it is very difficult for airlines to consistently turn a profit. Business failings are 
particularly likely to be punished - in the case of Flybmi, for instance, neither the company's costs nor its fares were 
low enough to compete effectively. It didn't have enough passengers for the number of routes it was offering, and 
could not change capacity without incurring more costs. It seems extremely likely that there will be more collapses 
in the sector, and more consolidation as weaker players get weeded out - Ryanair's takeover[19] of the Austrian 
airline Laudamotion is one recent example; another is the Virgin Atlantic tie-up[20] with Flybe. The attractions of 
growing through acquisition are much the same as in many sectors: it gives you greater control of purchasing costs 
by boosting your negotiating power, while also potentially reducing the downward pressure on ticket prices by 
taking competitors out of the market. Takeovers are not a panacea, however, since fuel prices will still fluctuate and 
underlying negatives like high sunk costs into aeroplanes don't go away. At the same time, there is no shortage of 
competition from new entrants who are seemingly oblivious to the challenges in the industry. In 2017, for 
Airlines are going bust in droves, so why do so many people try to launch them?
example[21], 79 new airlines launched around the world at the same time as 25 went bust. In Europe, it was 29 
entrants and 14 collapses. This rate of market entry is surely unsustainable, particularly in a mature market. It's also 
financially irrational when you reflect that the airlines sector produces[22] among the poorest returns on investment. 
Yet even during recessions, the rate of airline launches sometimes increases - see the graphic below. Your 
chances of launching a successful airline nowadays are far lower than, say, in the 1970s, when far fewer went 
under: there is overcapacity across the industry now, with one in five passenger seats empty across the world. 
Today's competition rules also make it much harder for nations to prop up failed airlines. The trouble is that this is a 
sexy industry; who wants to make widgets when you can pose in front of a plane? There is also a lot of hubris -

1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip    IATA[24]  This brings me to Ryanair, the biggest[25] carrier in Europe, which has 
itself issued several profit warnings - the most recent[26] in January. The Irish airline, which boasts a 15% market 
share and 142m passengers, blamed[27] the warning on reduced ticket prices in response to cutthroat competition. 
But don't look to Ryanair to become another of the casualties: chief executive Michael O'Leary still expects[28] the 
company to make profits after tax of around €1 billion to €1.1 billion (871 billion to 958 billion) for the financial year 
2019. This is in line with the operating margins in the region of 20% that the company has achieved[29] in recent 
years, higher than[30] any European competitor. As the airline with the highest internal efficiency by some distance, 
the lowest customer fares, an ambitious expansion plan and the greatest geographical coverage in Europe, Ryanair 
retains its fundamental competitive advantages. Softer fares might have hurt the company, but they will have hurt 
other European airlines much more. Besides all the other factors that make life so difficult for the likes of Flybmi, 
getting thumped by Ryanair is another almost inevitable pitfall of being in the airline business. Loizos

Feb 18, 2019( Litigation Futures: http://litigationfutures.com Delivered by Newstex)  Underwood: No logical 
difference between Bott's scheme and portalThe Court of Appeal ruling last week in the Bott ... flight delay litigation 
shows that judges are not giving solicitors credit for being more business-like and efficient, a leading commentator 
has argued. Kerry Underwood, senior partner of Underwoods Solicitors and a well-known lecturer and author, said 
the senior judiciary needed 'to think through rather more carefully the whole issue of access to justice and litigation, 
and how it may be delivered'. He spoke out following the appeal court ruling in Bott ... Solicitors v Ryanair[1], which 
concerned the airline dealing directly with the law firm's clients, including paying them compensation. 
The court said the firm was not conducting litigation when the claims were not contested, and so did not have an 
equitable lien over the compensation. The court said 30% of clients did not pass on the fees due to Bott. Writing on 
his blog[2], Mr Underwood said: 'At one level, lawyers are being encouraged to use portals and follow protocols and 
do everything to avoid litigation, and yet Bott ... appears to be being punished for using such a scheme, and for 
making significant profits from it.' He questioned the relevance to the legal principles of the fact that Bott's income 
from claims against Ryanair was over 100,000 a month, or the number of claims it was handling, 'except to show 
the success of the scheme and the attraction to members of the public'. Mr Underwood continued: 'So, at one level, 
we are consistently urged to be efficient and be a business, with the provision of legal services opened up to every 
Tom Dick and Harry, but when a firm does exactly that, they are punished by the courts by being refused a lien. 'I 
can see no logical difference between the pre-action road traffic portal, where 99% of cases are settled, and the 
scheme operated by Bott .... This decision should be overturned by the Supreme Court.' Senior partner David Bott 
made a similar argument in the wake of the ruling. He said he had hoped the court would recognise 'the way the 
law was going' in terms of firms becoming more efficient using technology to process matters and said it had taken 
a lot of investment for claims to be handled in what the court described as a 'mechanical and formulaic' way. 'If I'd 
had 100 10-year-qualified solicitors with pens and paper instead, it would not have been a problem,' he observed. 
Mr Bott added that, with 54% of its flight delay claims now being litigated, 'this may well be low value [work], but it is 
not necessarily low complexity or low in argument'. [ 1]: https://www.litigationfutures.com/news/uncontested-flight-

Feb 15, 2019( Kerry Underwood: http://kerryunderwood.wordpress.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The matters dealt 
with in this piece are examined in great detail in my three volume, 1,300 page book Personal Injury Small Claims, 
Portals and Fixed Costs - price 50 and available from Underwoods Solicitorshere[1].Kerry Underwood offers 
consultancy services in relation to this and other matters and details arehere[2].InBott ... Solicitors Ltd v Ryanair 
DAC [2019] EWCA Civ 143 (12 February 2019)[3]the Court of Appeal has upheld the High Court's decision that 
Ryanair was entitled to respond directly to passengers seeking compensation through solicitors, and had no liability 
to pay solicitors who had assisted in the claims.Since the High Court ruling the Supreme Court had given judgment 
in Gavin Edmondson Solicitors Ltd v Haven Insurance Co Ltd [2018] UKSC 21[4] .The High Court Judge here had 
been bound by Meguerditchian v Lightbound [1917] 2 KB 298to hold that mere negotiation by a solicitor resulting in 
recovery for a client could not give rise to a lien, but rather there had to be some form of proceedings, litigation or 
arbitration, but in Gavin Edmondson the Supreme Court had said that the fact that that no proceedings had been 
issued was not fatal to the equitable right of the solicitor.Here the Court of Appeal said that the distinction between 
cases with or without proceedings could not survive the decision of the Supreme Court in Gavin Edmondson, and 
the boundary had shifted.The key to fixing the boundary was to examine why equity will recognise a solicitor's right 
to be paid and the courts had stated that access to justice lay behind the development of the principle.Here, the 
Court of Appeal said that although formal proceedings were no longer necessary, the solicitor's services must still 
be recognisable as litigation services, promoting access to justice.This would include conducting litigation or 
contemplate litigation and would encompass proceedings under various protocols, such as the portal process as in 
Gavin Edmondson.However, the Court of Appeal found that the flight compensation claim scheme was largely 
mechanical and formulaic and did not constitute litigation services required to promote access to justice.The Court 
of Appeal held that passengers are entitled to use third parties to assist with their claim, but must go to the Ryanair 
claims process in the first instance.In Gavin Edmondsonthe Supreme Court said:'58. It is simply wrong in my view 
to seek to distil from those cases a general principle that equity will protect solicitors from any unconscionable 
interference with their expectations in relation to recovery of their charges.'Here the Court of Appeal quoted from 
the Supreme Court's decision at Paragraph 1 setting out the basis of the court's recognition of a solicitor's lien:'It is 
a judge-made remedy, motivated not by any fondness for solicitors as fellow lawyers or even as officers of the 
court, but rather because it promotes access to justice. 
Specifically it enables solicitors to offer litigation services on credit to clients who, although they have a meritorious 
case, lack the financial resources to pay up front for its pursuit. It is called a solicitor's lien because solicitors used 
to have a virtual monopoly on the pursuit of litigation in the higher courts. Nothing in this judgment should be read 
SOLICITORS DENIED LIEN; THE RYANAIR CASE
as deciding whether the relaxation of that monopoly means that the lien is still limited only to solicitors.'Although this 
is an equitable remedy, the Court of Appeal considered that the statutory definitions of litigation captured the 
essence of the principle underpinning the right to a lien.The court quoted section 119 of the Courts and Legal 
Services Act 1990 which defines 'litigation services' as 'any services which it would be reasonable to expect a 
person who is exercising, or contemplating exercising, a right to conduct litigation in relation to any proceedings, or 
any contemplated proceedings, to provide.' In section 87 of the Solicitors Act 1974, 'contentious business' is defined 
as:'business done in or for the purposes of proceedings begun before a court or arbitrator'.The Court of Appeal said 
that this would include proceedings under one of the many protocols that now exist, as well, potentially, in 
Alternative Dispute Resolution, and the court made the point that ADR by definition only comes into play when there 
is a dispute to resolve.Here, the Court of Appeal said that unless and until Ryanair refuses a claim, there is no 
dispute.InGaynor v Central West London Buses Ltd. [2006] EWCA Civ 1120[5] Dyson LJ said at [17]:'In my 
judgment, 'contemplated proceedings' are proceedings of which it can be said that there is at least a real likelihood 
that they will be issued. Until the potential defendant disputes the claim, it is not possible to say that proceedings 
are contemplated. Advising a client as to whether he or she has a good prima facie case and writing a letter of claim 
are not enough to amount to litigation services.'The Court of Appeal here went onto say:'58. The making of a claim 
under Regulation 261 is largely mechanical and formulaic. It requires little more than the flight distance and the 
length of the delay, in addition to details of the ticket purchase. The amount of compensation that a delayed 
passenger is entitled to receive is fixed by the Regulation. It is not a case in which the quantum of damages has to 
be evaluated. Bott's evidence is that the 'vast majority' of claims do not require the issue of court proceedings; and 
it claims a 99 per cent success rate. I do not consider that the services provided by Bott in processing that vast 
majority can be said either to be 'litigation services' of the kind that Lord Briggs must have had in mind; or to be 
required in order to promote access to justice, unless and until Ryanair disputes a claim. In addition, to recognise 
the existence of an equitable right would place a solicitor in a far more privileged position than a claims handler 
performing the same services. I cannot see any justification for that; especially since the rationale for the equitable 
right is not motivated by any fondness for solicitors. If a claim is disputed, different considerations will arise.59. In 
my judgment, therefore, where Bott simply writes a letter of claim or assists a client to complete the on-line form, 
and the claim is paid in response to the letter or the form, it is not entitled to an interest in the compensation that 
equity will protect. I would reject this ground of appeal.'Comment The Senior Judiciary need to think through rather 
more carefully the whole issue of access to justice and litigation and how it may be delivered.At one level, lawyers 
are being encouraged to use portals and follow protocols and do everything to avoid litigation, and yet Bott ... 
Solicitors Limited appear to be being punished for using such a scheme, and for making significant profits from 
it.What on earth is the relevance to the legal principles of the fact that Bott's income from claims against Ryanair 
was over 100,000 a month? (see Paragraph 16 of the judgment).What is the relevance of the number of claims that 
Bott were handling, except to show the success of the scheme and the attraction to members of the public?So, at 
one level, we are consistently urged to be efficient and be a business, with the provision of legal services opened 
up to every Tom Dick and Harry, but when a firm does exactly that they are punished by the courts by being refused 
a lien.I can see no logical difference between the pre-action road traffic portal, where 99% of cases are settled, and 
the scheme operated by Bott ... Solicitors Limited.This decision should be overturned by the Supreme Court.I deal 
with the decision of the High Court and the Supreme Court in my blogs -COURT REFUSES TO GRANT

Feb 13, 2019( Litigation Futures: http://litigationfutures.com Delivered by Newstex)  Bott: Ruling will require small 
change to processesThe work done by pioneering law firm Bott ... in bringing uncontested flight delay claims does 
not amount to litigation services and so it cannot claim an equitable lien over the damages for its costs, the Court of 
Appeal has ruled[1]. However, this will not be the case if the claim is disputed, Lord Justice Lewison said. The claim 
by the Cheshire law firm against Ryanair came after the budget airline stopped dealing with the solicitors in 2016 
and instead corresponded with, and paid compensation to, their passenger clients directly. Bott argued that it was 
entitled to an equitable lien over direct payments, which would require Ryanair to hold back part of the 
compensation in order to cover the firm's fees, or to pay all the compensation to the solicitors, as it used to do. Bott 
charges 25% of the compensation plus VAT and an administration fee of 25 per passenger. 
Depending on the length of the flight, passengers can be awarded €250, €400 or €600 under EU Regulation 261. 
The firm has led the market in developing a flight delay practice. The process is largely automated unless the airline 
disputes the claim. The court said the firm has acted on approximately 125,000 flight delay claims since February 
2013 - although the figure will now be higher, as fresh witness statements were not supplied for the appeal because 
it was a part 8 claim. In 2016, at the time Ryanair changed its approach, Bott was handling approximately 1,100 
flight delay compensation claims against the airline per month, with total claims then outstanding for approximately 
6,500 clients. The average recovery per claim was €327 and Bott's average fee per claim was 95. So, the court 
said, Bott's fee income from claims against Ryanair was over 100,000 per month. At the time, Ryanair did not tell 
Bott when it contacted clients, and so in some cases it would issue proceedings on behalf of a client without 
knowing the case had settled. This has since changed and the firm is copied in on correspondence. Further, by 
paying clients directly, Bott lost the opportunity to deduct its fees from the compensation before it paid over the 
damages. The court said: 'Bott, therefore, must pursue the client directly for payment. Its experience has been that 
only about 70% of clients pay in response to a direct request. That is said to threaten the viability of its business 
model.' Last year, Mr Edward Murray, sitting as a judge of the Chancery Division, rejected Bott's claim to an 
equitable lien. He said he was bound by a 1917 authority (Meguerditchian v Lightbound) to hold that mere 
negotiation by a solicitor resulting in a recovery for the client could not give rise to a lien, and that there had to be 
some form of proceedings either by way of litigation or arbitration. The judge added that, in the vast majority of flight 
delay cases, there was not even a negotiation - either the client was entitled to compensation in the amount fixed by 
the EU regulation or they were not. The judge was not persuaded to find differently despite the then Court of 
Appeal's ruling in Gavin Edmondson Solicitors Ltd v Haven Insurance Co Ltd, concerning an insurance company 
that settled personal injury claims directly with a law firm's clients. That ruling was superseded by the Supreme 
Court[2], which last year upheld the ultimate decision that the insurer had to pay the solicitors the costs they would 
Uncontested flight delay claims 'not litigation', CA rules
have earned, but got there in a different way. Lord Briggs said: 'Provided that the debt has arisen in part from the 
activities of the solicitor there is no reason in principle why formal proceedings must first have been issued.' Bott 
argued that the Supreme Court had answered the question of equitable lien in its favour. However, giving the Court 
of Appeal's unanimous ruling, Lewison LJ focused on what constituted formal proceedings for the lien to exist. 'The 
bright line distinction between a case where no proceedings have been issued and a case in which they have, 
cannot survive Gavin Edmondson SC. The boundary, therefore, has been shifted. But how far?' He cited Lord 
Briggs's comment that access to justice lay behind the development of the principle. Lewison LJ continued: 'This, to 
my mind, is the key to fixing the boundary. In my judgment, although it is no longer necessary for formal 
proceedings to have been issued, the services that the solicitor provides must still be recognisable as litigation 
services, promoting access to justice.' Given that other professionals involved in litigation and arbitration were not 
entitled to the equitable right, 'it seems to me that the services that will attract the protection of equity are services 
of the kind that a solicitor would perform in conducting litigation or contemplated litigation'. He continued: 'The 
making of a claim under Regulation 261 is largely mechanical and formulaic. It requires little more than the flight 
distance and the length of the delay, in addition to details of the ticket purchase. 'The amount of compensation that 
a delayed passenger is entitled to receive is fixed by the regulation. It is not a case in which the quantum of 
damages has to be evaluated. 'Bott's evidence is that the 'vast majority' of claims do not require the issue of court 
proceedings; and it claims a 99% success rate. 'I do not consider that the services provided by Bott in processing 
that vast majority can be said either to be 'litigation services' of the kind that Lord Briggs must have had in mind; or 
to be required in order to promote access to justice, unless and until Ryanair disputes a claim.' He added that 
recognising the existence of an equitable right would place a solicitor in a 'far more privileged position' than a claims 
handler performing the same services and there was no justification for this. 'In my judgment, therefore, where Bott 
simply writes a letter of claim or assists a client to complete the on-line form, and the claim is paid in response to 
the letter or the form, it is not entitled to an interest in the compensation that equity will protect.' Mr Murray had also 
rejected Bott's challenge to a change to Ryanair's standard terms and conditions, which required passengers with 
claims initially to deal directly with the airline. He ruled that it did not put a material obstacle in the way of making 
such a claim or result in the passenger recovering less than they were entitled to. Lewison LJ agreed. 'If a 
passenger needs help in filling in the on-line form there is nothing to prevent that. On the contrary, clause 15.2.7 
permits it. 'All that the passenger has to do is to press the send or submit button. And even that could be done by a 
third party, provided that the claim is made in the name of the passenger. 'At most the delay in processing a claim is 
30 days, which is no longer than the response time that Bott itself requests. After that, a passenger is free to 
process a claim in any way he chooses, with or without the assistance of third parties.' Bott ... senior partner David 
Bott told Litigation Futures that he was disappointed by the decision, as he and counsel felt that the Supreme Court 
ruling had established that the lien did not just apply when litigation had taken place. He had also hoped the court 
would recognise 'the way the law was going' in terms of firms becoming more efficient using technology to process 
matters - far removed from practice in 1917 - and said it had taken a lot of investment for claims to be handled in a 
'mechanical and formulaic' way. 'If I'd had 100 10-year-qualified solicitors with pens and paper instead, it would not 
have been a problem,' he observed. Mr Bott added that, with 54% of its flight delay claims being litigated, 'this may 
well be low value [work], but it is not necessarily low complexity or low in argument'. He stressed that the firm's 
business model was not under threat. 'It will be a nudge on the tiller,' he said, and the firm will amend its processes 
to make clearer to clients what is expected of them when they receive their compensation. But Mr Bott said the 
ruling on Ryanair's terms and conditions was helpful. 'We argued that the passenger should have total freedom of 
choice as to how they could lodge their claim and who could help them. We welcome the Court of Appeal's decision 
that passengers are free to use third parties, so long as the claim is made in their name.' [ 1]:

Belgium is closing its airspace for 24 hours during a nationwide strike. The industrial action, which begins on 
Tuesday evening, will also affect police, hospitals, buses and trains.Belgium's air traffic control authority said on 
Tuesday it was forced to close the country's airspace between Tuesday 10 p.m. CET (2100 UTC) and the same 
time on Wednesday.The strike in the country that hosts many EU institutions and NATO was called by unions 
seeking higher wages. 
Belgium's air traffic control organization, skeyes, said in a statement that because of the staffing uncertainties, it 
was taking its responsibility "to guarantee the safety of air traffic."In Belgium, workers do not have to say in advance 
whether or not they plan to work during trade union actions, making it difficult for authorities to predict 
availability.Brussels Airport canceled all incoming and outgoing flights during the strike. Nearby Charleroi airport, a 
local hub for Ryanair, announced its closure. German carrier TUI fly will operate its scheduled Belgian flights from 
the nearest French and Dutch airports. Brussels Airlines canceled more than 200 flights. No aircraft flying below 
8,000 meters — the area controlled by skeyes — will be allowed to fly over Belgium. Above that altitude, a control 
center in the Dutch city of Maastricht will control aircraft flying above Belgian territory.NATO meeting Belgian rail 
and other public transport systems are expected to be hit hard during the stoppage. Police, mail and hospital 
services will also be affected.Brussels, home to NATO, will host a meeting of defense ministers on Wednesday, 
with officials from the transatlantic military alliance converging on the city."We have no indication of any impact of 
the strike on the meeting," said a NATO official.Talks break downThe strike comes in response to a collapse in 
wage negotiations. The trade unions rejected a proposed increase of 0.8 per cent for 2019-2020, arguing that it was 
too low, reported the Belga news agency. International trains such as the Eurostar, Thalys and TGV services were 
unlikely to be disrupted. kw/msh (AP, AFP, dpa)Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of

Sir Freddie Laker, cartel buster and passengers' champion

Feb 09, 2019( Adam Smith Institute Blog: http://www.adamsmith.org/blog Delivered by Newstex)  Sir Freddie Laker 
died on February 9th, 2006, having been one of the leading pioneers in opening up civil aviation to vast numbers of 
ordinary people who were previously priced out of it. Most airlines, both public and private, were members of IATA, 
the International Air Transport Association, which in those days acted to limit competition between them. 
They charged the same (high) fares, and were even subject to regulations governing the quality of sandwiches they 
served to prevent attempts to poach passengers by serving better ones. I sometimes flew with Loftliedir, the 
Icelandic airline that refused to join IATA, and could charge lower fares. But it did involve stopping at Keflavik on the 
way, and therefore took longer. Sir Freddie founded Laker Airways in 1966 with a couple of second-hand 
turboprops. He ran no-frills charter flights for which passengers bought tickets on the day of travel, and provided 
their own food. It became his model for the later 'Skytrain' flights, but it took years of negotiating with civil aviation 
authorities, which were themselves subject to intense strong-arm lobbying by established airlines trying to squeeze 
out would-be competitors, and by politicians trying to protect their national flag-carriers. He applied for a licence to 
run low-cost transatlantic flights in 1971, but it took years of wrangling against determined opposition before the first 
Skytrain flight to the US took off in 1977. It was an immediate sensation, charging 59 one-way for a no-frills flight 
aboard his red, black and white DC-10s. His business model aimed at a load factor of 50 percent, but within a year 
it was 80 percent. It was then that he received his knighthood. It changed aviation forever. The big established 
airlines, British Airways, Pan Am and TWA, immediately matched Laker's standby fares and rules for a few of their 
economy-class seats, and standby fares were introduced. The media commented on the new "blue jean" young 
passengers who were taking to the airways as air travel at the new low prices achieved mass popularity. Laker's 
low-cost model was the precursor to later budget airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair. His company went bankrupt 
in 1982, following an aggressive and sustained campaign by American and European airlines to put him out of 
business. The campaign included pressure on banks to foreclose on loans made to Laker. A civil lawsuit brought by 
Laker was settled out of court in his favour. Civil aviation was changed forever by Sir Freddie, and his legacy lives 
on in the low-cost carriers that fly today. His name is preserved in several airport lounges named after him, and in 
planes named "Spirit of Sir Freddie." He is remembered with affection by those who campaign for choice and 
competition to break open cartels and service customers instead of protecting producers.

Tuesday's Analyst Blog: Airline Stock Roundup: DAL, LUV, RYAAY ...reIn the past week, key players like SkyWest 
and Allegiant Travel Company released their respective fourth-quarter 2018 financial numbers.With oil prices 
declining substantially in the October-December timeframe (the fourth quarter period), it was not surprising that the 
aforementioned carriers registered better-than-expected earnings. Low fuel costs apart, fleet transition initiatives 
aided SkyWest's results. 
Meanwhile, robust passenger revenues provided a boost to Allegiant's fourth-quarter performance.However, 
European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings reported lackluster results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 (ended 
Dec 31, 2018) due to declining air fares.On the non-earnings front, Delta Air Lines' January traffic report failed to 
impress investors as load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) was flat with traffic growth matching capacity 
expansion. An expansion-related updated was also available from Southwest Airlines in the past week.(Read the

Feb 05, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, key 
players like SkyWest SKYW[1] and Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[2] released their respective fourth-quarter 
2018 financial numbers.With oil prices declining substantially in the October-December timeframe (the fourth 
quarter period), it was not surprising that the aforementioned carriers registered better-than-expected earnings. Low 
fuel costs apart, fleet transition initiatives aided SkyWest's results. Meanwhile, robust passenger revenues provided 
a boost to Allegiant's fourth-quarter performance.However, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] 
reported lackluster results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 (ended Dec 31, 2018) due to declining air fares.On the 
non-earnings front, Delta Air Lines' DAL[4] January traffic report failed to impress investors as load factor (% of 
seats filled by passengers) was flat with traffic growth matching capacity expansion. An expansion-related updated 
was also available from Southwest Airlines LUV[5] in the past week.(Read the lastAirline Stock Roundup for Jan 30, 
2019[6])Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. SkyWest's fourth-quarter 2018 earnings of $1.28 per 
share, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.09. Also, the bottom line improved 58% on a year-over-year 
basis.Quarterly revenues came in at $803.5 million, which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $789.6 
million and improved year over year on the company's improved fleet mix. 
(Read more: SkyWest Q4 Earnings ...venues Top on Fleet Upgrade[7]).SkyWest carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong 
Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[8].2. Allegiant's fourth-quarter 2018 
earnings of $2.56 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.49. Total operating revenues increased 
8.7% year over year to $412.1 million and also surpassed the consensus mark of $409.1 million. The top line was 
primarily driven by a 10.1% rise in passenger revenues. (Read more: Allegiant Stock Up 3% on Q4 Earnings 
...venue Beat[9]).3. Ryanair suffered a loss of €19.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to a profit of 
€105.6 million a year-ago. Results were hurt by a 6% decline average fares to €30. Excess winter capacity in 
Europe led to the decline. What is worse is that the carrier stated fares may continue to decrease due to 
overcapacity.High costs too impacted the company's results. The top line, however, expanded 9% to €1.53 billion

fiscal 2019 profit after tax in the €1-€1.1 billion range. Winter fares are still anticipated to decline 7% year over year. 
The company said that it might lower its fiscal 2019 profit forecast further in the event of 'unexpected Brexit or 
security developments which adversely impact yields between now and the end of March'.In another development, 
Ryanair announced a structural overhaul. The carrier announced that it is moving to a group structure with each 
group having its own CEO and management team. Ryanair's current CEO Michael O'Leary will be the group's CEO. 
He has inked a five-year contract to this effect.Ryanair's January traffic was impressive, with the metric (including

its flight schedule through Oct 1, 2019. Additionally, the carrier has announced the resumption of a few previously-

At Delta, consolidated traffic — measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) — came in at 16.56 billion, up 5.9% 
year over year. Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) also climbed 5.9% to 20.79 billion on a year-
over-year basis. As a result, consolidated load factor remained flat at 79.7%.Additionally, the company recorded an 
on-time performance (mainline) of 86.7% and a completion factor (mainline) of 99.6%. Notably, Delta's passenger 
count inched up 6.2% to around 14.1 million in January.Performance The following table shows the price movement 
of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.The table above shows that most 
airline stocks traded in the green in the past week leading to the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gaining 2.8%. Shares of 
GOL Linhas GOL[11] appreciated the most (12.4%) in the period.Over the last six months, the sector tracker lost 
6.7%, reflecting the multiple headwinds like capacity woes and high costs confronting the space. Shares of 
Hawaiian Holdings HA[12] depreciated the most (26.8%) in the period.What's Next in the Airline Space?We expect

Ernst Chinese markets except Hong Kong were closed Monday as part of Lunar New Year celebrations with the 
Hang Seng up 0.2%. US futures are slightly higher following President Trump's positive words about the US-China 
trade war ahead of his State of the Union address Tuesday. European markets are mixed with the FTSE 100 and 
Italy's FTSE MIB both trading up while France's CAC 40 is broadly down. After bullish comments on trade from US 
President Donald Trump, China stocks gained slightly in Hong Kong amid thinner trading as much of the region's 
population heads into the Lunar New Year holidays. 
In a sweeping interview with CBS's Face the Nation, Trump touched on the economy and trade between the US 
and China — touting the strong January jobs report while saying talks with Beijing are 'doing very well' and there is 
a "good chance" of a deal over tariffs. See Trump's CBS interview here[1]. The Hang Seng rose 0.2%. The 
Shanghai Composite Index and other Chinese markets are closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. US futures 
signal a decline of less than 0.2% for the benchmark S...00, the Nasdaq and the Dow. Futures were up 0.1% as of 
10.00 a.m in London (5.00 a.m EST). Major European stock benchmarks were also little changed with the Euro 
Stoxx 50 flat. Japanese and Australian stocks were boosted Monday with both markets closing up 0.5%. A flurry of 
market catalysts are in store this week: Google, Twitter, Ryanair, Disney, Philip Morris, and SoftBank are among 
those reporting earnings in the coming days. The Financial Times reported[2] that Wall Street analysts have 
slashed their estimates for US earnings in the first quarter and now expect the first year-on-year decline since the 
second quarter of 2016. Trump is set to deliver his State of the Union address on Tuesday. On Wednesday,

https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/ryanair-holdings-plc-logo.jpgZacks Investment Research[1] upgraded shares of 
Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY) from a hold rating to a buy rating in a report published on Monday. They currently have 
$76.00 target price on the transportation company's stock. 
According to Zacks, "Ryanair is being aided by strong demand for air travel, especially due to low air fares. Notably, 
traffic in December rose 12% year over year. We are also impressed by Ryanair's efforts to reward shareholders in 
the form of share buybacks. In tune with this, the carrier returned more than €540 m to shareholders in the first six 
months of fiscal 2019. We remain positive on the collective deals signed by the company with German Pilot union. 
We expect strong traffic to aid its fiscal third-quarter results as well. Detailed results should be out on Feb 4. The 
Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 earnings increased 0.4% over the last 60 days. On the flip side, 
continued labor unrest is hurting Ryanair significantly. The stock has shed more than 45% of its value in a year's 
time mainly due to the labor unrest."Several other analysts also recently issued reports on the company.

Jan 23, 2019( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  The boss of Jet2 has 
warned that a no-deal Brexit would be 'extremely damaging' for both the UK and Europe, as the airline braces for 
potential restrictions and cost increases. Steve Heapy, chief executive of Jet2.com and Jet2holidays, said flying to 
Europe from the UK could be more expensive and heavily regulated for operators after Brexit. 'The worst thing that 
could happen is that we're not able to fly to Europe,' he said. 
'I think the chance of that happening is extremely low. 'I think we'll end up with something in the middle whereby 
we're able to fly into Europe, but I think it might be more expensive and there might be more restrictions.' Mr Heapy 
said Jet2, which is owned by London-listed Dart Group, would consider adding more flights to locations such as 
Turkey if it was not allowed into Europe. The comments come as Theresa May's Brexit 'Plan B' struggles to gain 
traction among MPs, making a no-deal exit increasingly likely. The airline, which has plans in place for a range of 
Brexit scenarios, is also banking on its balance sheet to help weather any disruption or a dip in consumer 
confidence. 'We have a very healthy bank balance and if it comes to a tough time where business perhaps is lower 
than normal, we have a lot of cash in the bank and will be able to continue operations for significantly longer than a 
number of our competitors.' The CEO said Jet2 is confident of a positive resolution to Brexit negotiations as the EU 
has 'a lot more to lose than we do' from a disruptive exit due to the high spend of British leisure travellers abroad. 
More than 60% of Jet2 destinations are in Spain, providing what Mr Heapy called a 'big boost' to the country's 
economy. His comments come as Jet2 marked a milestone with the delivery of the 100th aircraft in its fleet this 
week. The operator is currently the UK's third-largest airline and second-largest tour operator. Turbulence has hit 
the short-haul sector in recent months, with Flybe collapsing into administration while Ryanair last week issued a 
profit warning. Despite the problems affecting the industry, Mr Heapy said Jet2 was in a stronger position than 
many of its peers. 'We don't go for all-out growth,' he said 'I think that's very dangerous in a business where you just 
want growth for the sake of it. 'We are growing because customers are finding Jet and Jet2.com holidays and 
booking them and having a good time and rebooking them. The growth is a result of success in providing a quality 
product.' He also ruled out the possibility of becoming a consolidator in the sector, saying the company will instead 
focus on organic growth. 'We see no need to buy companies because normally when they're up for sale it means 
maybe there's trouble ahead so why would we buy trouble?' Read more: Jet2 boss warns of 'extremely damaging'

Jan 23, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] lowered its profitability forecast for fiscal 2019 (ending Mar 31, 2019). Anticipated low 
airfares for winter induced the European carrier to trim its view.Moving across the Atlantic to the United States, 
Spirit Airlines SAVE[2] raised its fourth-quarter view for total revenues per available seat miles (TRASM: a key 
measure of unit revenues). The Miramar, FL-based carrier, which is expected to reveal its fourth-quarter results on 
Feb 5, attributed the decision to strong yields during the peak season.Meanwhile, ManaAir LLC — a United Airlines 
joint venture — completed the previously announced ExpressJet Airlines buyout. Notably, United Airlines is United 
Continental's UAL[3] wholly-owned subsidiary.Copa Holdings CPA[4] was another major newsmaker, courtesy of its 
December traffic report. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) declined at this Latin-American carrier as 
traffic growth was outpaced by capacity expansion.(Read the lastAirline Stock Roundup for Jan 16, 2019[5])Recap 
of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Ryanair expects profit after tax in the €1-€1.1 billion range compared 
with €1.1-€1.2 billion projected earlier. Winter fares are anticipated to decline 7% year over year, wider than the 
earlier projection of a 2% decrease. 
The guidance, however, excludes data from the LaudaMotion unit, which was acquired by Ryanair in calendar 
2018. Start-up losses from the unit are expected to be €140 million in fiscal 2019. (Read more: Ryanair Trims FY19 
Profit Forecast, Stock Down 3%[6]).2. Spirit Airlines now expects total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a 
key measure of unit revenues) to increase approximately 11.4% year over year (the earlier view had called for this 
metric to increase approximately 11%). The carrier expects capacity to expand 16.2% in the soon-to-be-reported 
quarter, higher than the prior estimate of a 15% increase.This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) carrier expects non-fuel 
unit costs (adjusted) to increase 5.5% (earlier the company had predicted the metric to rise 5-5.5% year over year). 
Economic fuel cost is now projected to be $2.26 per gallon compared with $2.27 estimated earlier. You can seethe 
complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[7].3. At Copa Holdings, consolidated traffic (measured in 
revenue passenger miles or RPMs) for December came in at 1.9 billion, up 5.3% from the year-ago figure. On a 
year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) rose 6% to 2.3 billion. For full-year 
2018, Copa Holdings generated RPMs of 21.5 billion (up 8.1% year over year) and ASMs of 25.8 billion (up 7.9% 
year over year) (read more: Copa Holdings' December Traffic Rises, Load Factor Down[8]).4. SkyWest's SKYW[9] 
erstwhile subsidiary, ExpressJet Airlines, has been taken over by ManaAir LLC. At the time of announcing the deal 
in December 2018, SkyWest had said that it is valued at $70 million. ExpressJet, which flies for United Airlines, 
aims to expand its fleet size with 25 new dual-class Embraer E175 jets in 2019. First of the 25 planes is scheduled

to be delivered in April.In another development, ExpressJet increased its pilot sign-on bonus to $22,000. Pilots with 
an eligible type rating will receive an additional $5,000. We believe, the move is aimed at combating the shortage of 
pilots bothering regional carriers.Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major 
airline players over the past week and during the last six months.The table above shows that majority of the airline 
stocks traded in the red over the last week leading to the NYSE ARCA Airline Index's decline over the past week. 
Over the course of six months, the sector tracker decreased 6% despite impressive gains at the likes of GOL 
Linhas and Spirit Airlines.What's Next in the Airline Space?Industry heavyweights American Airlines AAL[10],

EasyJet blasts Gatwick drone chaos as 'wake-up call' after 15m hit
EasyJet blasts Gatwick drone chaos as 'wake-up call' after 15m hit

Jan 22, 2019( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  EasyJet has said last 
month's drone disruption at Gatwick was a 'wake-up call' to airports after it cost the airline 15 million and affected 
82,000 customers. The low cost carrier said it racked up 10 million in passenger compensation costs and 5 million 
in lost revenues after more than 400 of its flights were cancelled when the drone sightings brought Gatwick to a 
standstill just before Christmas. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said he was 'disappointed' the airport took 
so long to resolve the situation and reopen the runways. 
But he said it was a 'criminal act and illegal activity'. 'You can't always protect yourself from that, but it's a wake-up 
call and airports will be better prepared going forward,' he added. The drone scare saw flights at Gatwick 
suspended on December 19 at the height of the pre-Christmas travel rush, with the airport not full reopened until 
December 21. The three days of chaos saw more than 1,000 flights grounded and some 140,000 passengers 
affected. Mr Lundgren said easyJet 'did everything we could to help our customers affected by the incident'. 'I am 
proud of the way our teams worked around the clock to mitigate the impact of the incident and looked after affected 
customers,' he said. In its first-quarter update, easyJet said its capacity rose 18.2% to 24.1 million, which was lower 
than expected, due in part to the drone disruption. Total revenues in the three months to December 31 lifted 13.7% 
to 1.3 billion, while passenger revenues rose 12.2% to 1.03 billion. Passenger numbers in the quarter increased by 
15.1% to 21.6 million. Shares in the FTSE 100-listed group rose 7% after the update. EasyJet said it was 'well 
prepared' for Brexit and had not seen an impact on passenger bookings ahead of March 29. It added: 'Both the EU 
and the UK have committed to ensure that flights between the UK and EU will continue in the event of a no-deal 
Brexit.' Mr Lundgren said: 'For the first half of 2019, booking levels currently remain encouraging despite the lack of 
certainty around Brexit for our customers.' Overall the group said full-year expectations are 'broadly' in line with 
market forecasts, though it said it expects a loss this year in its Berlin business, where it took over of some of Air 
Berlin's operation when the carrier went bust. It sees easyJet largely shrug off the woes suffered by rival Ryanair, 
which warned over profits last week as it counts the cost of lower-than-expected airfares over winter amid over 
capacity in Europe. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'The drone disruption at Gatwick 
in December means these results aren't quite what easyJet was hoping for at the start of the year, but it hasn't 
blown things too far off course.' Fortunately Brexit disruption seems to be minimal so far, and while meeting full year 
expectations may be a bit more of a stretch from here, they're still very achievable,' he added. Read more: EasyJet

Jan 21, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Ryanair 
Holdings RYAAY[1] decreased 3.3% on Jan 18 to $65.75, following the company's decision to lower its profitability 
view for fiscal 2019 (ending Mar 31, 2019). Per this Irish low-cost carrier, the decision can be primarily attributed to 
lower-than-expected air fares for the second half of the fiscal year.In fact, Ryanair has struggled for quite some 
time. This is evident from the fact that the stock has shed 45.6% of its value in a year's time. Factors like labor 
unrest and high costs have prevented the stock from gaining altitude.Ryanair's decision to trim its fiscal 2019 
earnings view is an added setback to the already struggling stock.GuidanceAnticipating weak winter air fares, 
Ryanair expects profit after tax (PAT) between €1 billion and €1.1 billion. 
The earlier projection had called for the metric to be in the €1.1-€1.2 billion range. Winter fares are anticipated to 
decline 7% year over year compared with the earlier projection of a 2% decrease.The guidance, however, excludes 
data from the LaudaMotion unit, which was acquired by Ryanair in calendar 2018. Start up losses from the unit are 
expected to be €140 million in fiscal 2019.Nonetheless, the carrier is optimistic about traffic and costs.. For fiscal 
2019, traffic is expected to increase 9% to 142 million compared with the earlier projection of 141 million. Also, 
Ryanair expects to perform better on the unit cost front in the second half of the fiscal year.The company said that it 
might lower its fiscal 2019 profit forecast further in the event of 'unexpected Brexit or security developments which 
adversely impact yields between now and the end of March'. Updates regarding which will be available on Feb 4, 
when Ryanair is scheduled to release its third-quarter fiscal 2019 results.Zacks Rank ...y PicksRyanair has a Zacks 
Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Airline[2] industry are Spirit Airlines SAVE[3], Azul S.A.

Jan 18, 2019( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  London's top-flight stocks 
were bolstered by a weaker pound and upbeat global markets on Friday, as progress appeared to be made in trade 
relations between the US and China. The FTSE 100 finished the day up by 133.41 points, or 1.95% higher, at 
6,968.33. It matched the mood of global stocks, which were lifted by reports that US Treasury Secretary Steven 
Mnuchin is discussing lifting some or all of the tariffs imposed on Chinese imports. The move would ease tension 
ahead of meetings between the two sides which are scheduled for later this month. 
The news also helped push up oil prices, with a barrel of Brent crude oil trading 2.21% higher at 62.49 US dollars. 
Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said: 'The prospect of tariffs being reduced on China, crude's 
largest importer, kept buying interest in oil, whilst signs that the OPEC output cut had begun was also supportive to 
the price. 'However, gains in oil were capped after the International Energy Agency warned over slowing demand 
owing to a slowing global economy and rising US output as US shale companies up production.' In Europe, the 
German Dax rose 2.63% and the French Cac was up 1.7%. The FTSE 100 was also boosted by the weaker pound, 
which was still weighed on by the uncertainty over Brexit. Sterling was down 0.43% against the euro at 1.134 and 
0.7% lower versus the US dollar at 1.289. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: 'The UK is set 
to leave the EU in late March, and we are still none-the-wiser about the next move. Theresa May will reveal a new 
deal on Monday, but given her crushing defeat in the commons earlier this week, dealers aren't holding out much 
hope.' The market's buoyancy came despite gloom in the airline sector following Ryanair's profit warning on Friday 
morning. The Irish carrier lowered its full-year post-tax profit guidance from between 1.1 billion euros (966 million) 
and 1.2 billion euros (1 billion) to a new range of one billion euros (878 million) and 1.1 billion euros (966 million). 
Easyjet suffered from the knock-on effects of the announcement. The stock was held back from making the same 
gains as its fellow FTSE 100 companies, climbing just 3p to 1,172p. Meanwhile Eddie Stobart Logistics saw sales 
race ahead last year as the road haulier was boosted by new contract wins. The firm posted a 35% rise in full-year 
revenue to 843 million in the 12 months to November 30, ahead of market expectations. Shares were 4.5p higher at 
108p. Shares in Sophos tumbled after the cybersecurity firm warned that 'subdued' trading would drag into the 
fourth quarter. The company said that it experienced a decline in billings from new customers, as well as a decline 
in hardware orders in the third quarter to December 31, adding that the final three months of the year would see a 
similar trend. The stock closed 66.4p lower at 310.2p. The top risers on the FTSE 100 were Ashtead up 84p to 
1,953p, Melrose Industries up 7.2p to 169.55p, GVC Holdings up 27.5p to 714.5p and Morrisons up 8.8p to 
230.65p. The biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 were Ocado down 17.2p to 883p, Fresnillo down 13.2p to 887.6p and 
FTSE 100 boosted by easing US -China trade tensions

Jan 18, 2019( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair has warned over 
profits as the budget airline counts the cost of lower than expected airfares over winter amid over capacity in 
Europe. The Irish carrier on Friday lowered its full-year post-tax profit guidance from between 1.1 billion euros (966 
million) and 1.2 billion euros (1 billion) to a new range of one billion euros (878 million) and 1.1 billion euros (966 
million). Ryanair said that winter fares are expected to fall 7%, a much bigger drop than the previously guided fall of 
2%. Last year, Ryanair booked profit of 1.45 billion euros (1.2 billion) and the downgrade represents the second 
warning in quick succession. 
In October the airline said profits would be knocked a spate of crew strikes and rising fuel prices. Ryanair boss 
Michael O'Leary also warned that he cannot rule out further downgrades to profit guidance. He said: 'There is short 
haul over-capacity in Europe this winter, but Ryanair continues to pursue our price passive/load factor active 
strategy to the benefit of our customers who are enjoying record lower air fares. 'While we have reasonable visibility 
over forward quarter four bookings, we cannot rule out further cuts to air fares and/or slightly lower full-year 
guidance if there are unexpected Brexit or security developments which adversely impact yields between now and 
the end of March.' However, the firm also expects stronger traffic growth of 9% to 142 million and stronger ancillary 
sales as more customers choose lower cost optional services. Mr O'Leary also said that the competitive 
environment will 'shake out' some of Ryanair's rivals. 'We believe this lower fare environment will continue to shake 
out more loss making competitors, with Wow, Flybe, and reportedly Germania for example, all currently for sale,' he 
said. Ryanair will release its third quarter results on February 4. Read more: Ryanair issues profit warning as lower

Jan 09, 2019( Technology and Marketing Law Blog: http://blog.ericgoldman.org Delivered by Newstex)  Trespass * 
Ryanair v. Expedia[1], 2018 WL 3727599 (W.D. Wash. Aug. 6, 2018). CFAA can apply when a US company 
scrapes data from an international website. * Jackie's Enterprises, Inc. v. Belleville 2018 N.Y. Slip Op. 
07225 (N.Y. App. Div. Oct. 25, 2018):Generally, the factual allegations underlying plaintiff's trespass to chattels 
and/or conversion claim are that defendants unlawfully canceled shipments of goods, attempted to divert goods, 
supplies and mail from plaintiff's possession, unlawfully accessed plaintiff's Facebook and Yelp! online accounts 
and web pages and unlawfully attempted to gain access to and control of plaintiff's credit card processing service 
account. Assuming that a cause of action for trespass or conversion even applies to intangible items such as 
websites, as noted above, plaintiff had no possessory interest in the online accounts and web pages because the 
seizure order permitted Belleville to lawfully gain control of them. Additionally, defendants did not actually interfere 
with plaintiff's control of the credit card processing service account. Regarding orders and deliveries, plaintiff was 
required to point to 'specific identifiable' property that defendants interfered with or over which defendants allegedly 
exercised control. Setting aside general allegations in the complaint and Keto's affidavit, plaintiff only specifically 
referred to defendants interfering with deliveries from one particular supplier, but Keto averred that she ultimately 
received the delivery in her new location with no appreciable delay and no alleged damage. For the remainder of 
the alleged orders or deliveries, plaintiff failed to sufficiently identify them, or assert that defendants either actually 
interfered with them or were not lawfully authorized to do so by the seizure order. Thus, Supreme Court properly 
dismissed the cause of action sounding in trespass to chattels or conversion. Accordingly, the court properly 
dismissed the entire complaint.* Andrew Sellars, Twenty Years of Web Scraping and the Computer Fraud and 
Abuse Act[2], 24 B.U. J. Sci. ...ch. L. 372 (2018). The abstract:'Web scraping' is a ubiquitous technique for 
extracting data from the World Wide Web, done through a computer script that will send tailored queries to websites 
to retrieve specific pieces of content. The technique has proliferated under the ever-expanding shadow of the 
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), which, among other things, prohibits obtaining information from a 
computer by accessing the computer without authorization or exceeding one's authorized access. Unsurprisingly, 
many litigants have now turned to the CFAA in attempt to police against unwanted web scraping. Yet despite the 
rise in both web scraping and lawsuits about web scraping, practical advice about the legality of web scraping is 
hard to come by, and rarely extends beyond a rough combination of 'try not to get caught' and 'talk to a lawyer.' 
Most often the legal status of scraping is characterized as something just shy of unknowable, or a matter entirely 
left to the whims of courts, plaintiffs, or prosecutors. Uncertainty does indeed exist in the caselaw, and may stem in 
part from how courts approach the act of web scraping on a technical level. In the way that courts describe the act 
2H 2018 Quick Links, Part 4 (Trespass, Contracts)
of web scraping, they misstate some of the qualities of scraping to suggest that the technique is inherently more 
invasive or burdensome. The first goal of this piece is to clarify how web scrapers operate, and explain why one 
should not think of web scraping as being inherently more burdensome or invasive than humans browsing the web. 
The second goal of this piece is to more fully articulate how courts approach the all-important question of whether a 
web scraper accesses a website without authorization under the CFAA. I aim to suggest here that there is a fair 
amount of madness in the caselaw, but not without some method. Specifically, this piece breaks down the twenty 
years of web scraping litigation (and the sixty-one opinions that this litigation has generated) into four rough phases 
of thinking around the critical access question. The first runs through the first decade of scraping litigation, and is 
marked with cases that adopt an expansive interpretation of the CFAA, with the potential to extend to all scrapers 
so long as a website can point to some mechanism that signaled access was unauthorized. The second, starting in 
the late 2000s, was marked by a narrowing of the CFAA and a focus more on the code-based controls of scraping, 
a move that tended to benefit scrapers. In the third phase courts have receded back to a broad view of the CFAA, 
brought about by the development of a 'revocation' theory of unauthorized access. And most recently, spurred in 
part by the same policy concerns that led courts to initially constrain the CFAA in the first place, courts have begun 
to rethink this result. The conclusion of this piece identifies the broader questions about the CFAA and web 
scraping that courts must contend with in order to bring more harmony and comprehension to this area of law. They 
include how to deal with conflicting instructions on authorization coming different channels on the same website, 
how the analysis should interact with existing technical protocols that regulate web scraping, including the Robots 
Exclusion Standard, and what other factors beyond the wishes of the website host should govern application of the 
CFAA to unwanted web scraping.Contracts * Thomas v. Facebook, Inc.,2018 WL 3915585 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 15, 
2018):Plaintiff has not satisfied her 'heavy burden' of showing that the forum selection clause in Facebook's SRR 
was fraudulent or overreaching, that its enforcement would deprive her of day in court, that it contravenes public 
policy, or that it otherwise does not comport with fundamental fairness. On the contrary, Plaintiff offers no 
explanation for why this Court should not enforce the forum selection clause contained in Facebook's SRR, nor is 
the Court aware of any legal reason why that clause should not be enforced.* Biltz v. Google, Inc., 2018 WL 
3340567 (D. Hawaii July 6, 2018).In a transparent effort to evade the contractual forum selection clause that he 
acknowledges binds him, Brian Evans has enlisted the aid of his colleague, Mark Biltz, to stand in his shoes as 
Plaintiff. According to Biltz, he is not bound to litigate this action in Santa Clara County, California because unlike 
Evans, he did not agree to the YouTube Terms of Service agreement or Google's advertising program's terms, and 
his claims are, in any event, based on an oral, not written, contract that has no forum selection provisions. The 
evident gamesmanship gets Biltz (and Evans) nowhere. The gravamen of this action is that Google owes Biltz 
unpaid royalties for an internet video entitled, 'At Fenway,' that Biltz produced, Evans starred in, and which Evans 
uploaded to Google's YouTube platform in March 2013. There is no dispute that the YouTube Terms of Service 
agreement in effect now, and then, requires any claim arising out of YouTube's services to be brought in Santa 
Clara County, California. Whether the agreement's signator was Evans, Biltz, both, or neither, it matters not. They 
could not have availed themselves of YouTube's services without subjecting themselves to the same terms of 
service as every other user. The claims arising out of YouTube's services, which include all of the claims here, must 
be brought in California.* Daniel v. eBay, Inc.,2018 WL 3597654 (D.D.C. July 26, 2018). The court rejects eBay's 
request to arbitrate the buyer's claim over a counterfeit sale. The buyer signed up in 1999, when eBay's user 
agreement didn't have an arbitration clause but did have a unilateral amendment clause. eBay added the arbitration 
clause in 2012 and amended the agreement again in 2015, in both cases notifying its users about the changes. The 
court says the buyer didn't get sufficient notice. Posting the new terms to the web wasn't good enough, and a form 
email to all users didn't prove that the buyer had received it. This is a troubling ruling, and I hope it doesn't take root 
as precedent. * Lopez v. Terra's Kitchen, LLC,2018 WL 4489588 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 19, 2018): 'The Court finds that 
the agreement at issue in this case is a browsewrap [Eric's comment: ugh] agreement because the consumer 
assents to the Terms ...nditions simply by using the website or purchasing a subscription, without visiting the Terms 
...nditions page or even acknowledging that use of the website constitutes assent to the Terms ...nditions.the 
hyperlink to Defendant's Terms ...nditions appears in the bottom left-hand corner of the website footer of 
Defendant's webpages, below a grouping of 21 other hyperlinks, arranged in five columns, that cover topics like 
'Careers,' 'Buy a Gift Card,' 'Mediterranean Diet,' and 'Newsroom.'Here, the Terms ...nditions hyperlink is more or 
less buried at the bottom of Defendant's webpage. UnderNguyen, without more, this is insufficient to give rise to 
inquiry notice.' * Wickberg v. Lyft[3], 1:18-cv-12094-RGS (D. Mass. Dec. 19, 2018). Lyft's TOS for drivers requires 
arbitration. Drivers saw the following screen as part of signing up: https://blog.ericgoldman.org/wp-
2H 2018 Quick Links, Part 4 (Trespass, Contracts)
content/uploads/2019/01/lyft.png Relying heavily on Cullinane v. Uber[4], the court deems this a 'clickwrap' 
(ugh):Lyft's screen required Wickberg to click a box stating that he 'agree[d] to Lyft'sterms of services' before he 
could continue with the registration process. And although, as Wickberg asserts, 'Lyft's terms of service' appeared 
towards the bottom in a smaller font and without a typical blue-colored hyperlink, the phrase was pink and 
distinguishable on the screen. Wickberg affirmatively adopted those terms by clicking 'I agree.'[Personal self-
congratulatory note: my Fall 2018 Internet Law final exam[5] asked students to discuss if a pink hyperlink had the 
same legal effect as a blue hyperlink. ] The plaintiff said he couldn't remember clicking on the TOS. The court 
responds: 'the relevant inquiry is not whether he actually viewed the terms but whether they were reasonably 
communicated to him.' The court distinguishes two other Lyft losses based on different state law (ugh):In 
Applebaum v. Lyft, Inc.[6], a court in the Southern District of New York invalidated an online Lyft agreement 
because 'the text is difficult to read: 'I agree to Lyft's Terms of Service' is in the smallest font on the screen, dwarfed 
by the jumbo-sized pink 'Next' bar at the bottom of the screen and the bold header 'Add Phone Number' at the top.' 
Similarly, in Talbot v. Lyft, Inc., a California state court invalidated a Lyft agreement identical to the one at issue 
here because 'nothing supports the conclusion that (i) the pink words 'Terms of service' were a hyperlink or that (ii) 
they linked to the contract that governed the working relationship between Lyft and drivers.' I find these cases 
unpersuasive, as they apply New York and California law, and not the law of Massachusetts.So the court enforces 
the Lyft TOS and sends the case to arbitration. The correct result IMO. [ 1]:

Berlin's Tegel and Schönefeld airports are to go on a nearly four-hour strike on Monday, following a fourth round of 
failed wage negotiations between Germany's largest trade union, Ver.di, and the Federal Association of Aviation 
Security Companies (BDLS).Ver.di said the strike will begin at 5 a.m. local time (0400 UTC) and last until 8:45 a.m. 
(07:45 UTC).Tegel and Schönefeld have warned of "sever disruptions" for air traffic and called on passengers 
expecting to travel on Monday to contact airlines to check the status of particular flights.Read more: Ryanair 
German strike causes severe travel disruptionsEmployers' offer "inadequate"Ver.di's decision came after BDLS put 
forward what union officials said was a "completely inadequate offer" in talks over wage increases for 23,000 airport 
security personnel across Germany just before Christmas.The union said the association proposed a wage 
increase of 2 percent instead of 1.8 percent per year for those on a two-year contract and a wage increase for 
personnel in East German states only after five years.The union is demanding an increase in the hourly wage to 
€20 ($22.79) for staff working in passenger, freight, personnel and goods control at all German airports. 
An employee working in passenger control at one of the two Berlin airports currently receives €17.12 per 
hour.Employers hits back"Ver.di doesn't seem to want to negotiate a collective agreement, but rather strike," said 
the director of the employer's collective bargaining commission, Rainer Friebertshuser. He said the Ver.di's 
demands could mean an increase in individual wages of up to 55 percent at some airports.The trade union has not 
ruled out possible strikes at other airports across the country, but it said it would take into account individual holiday 
periods in each federal state.A fifth round of negotiations is scheduled to take place in Berlin on January 23.rh/amp

rating on shares of Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY) in a report published on Monday morning. According to Zacks, 
"Ryanair is being aided by strong demand for air travel, especially due to low air fares. 
Notably, traffic in November rose 11% year over year. We are also impressed by Ryanair's efforts to reward 
shareholders in the form of share buybacks. In tune with this, the carrier returned more than €540 m to 
shareholders in the first six months of fiscal 2019. We remain positive on the collective deals signed by the 
company with German Pilot union. On the flip side, continued labor unrest is expected to hurt Ryanair's results in 
the fiscal third quarter. The stock has shed more than 33% of its value so far in the year mainly due to the labor 
unrest. Despite the current downtrend in oil prices, fuel costs are anticipated to dent bottom-line growth. Labor costs 
related to the labor deals inked with the Irish and German pilots also raise concerns."Several other brokerages

Jan 04, 2019( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, Delta 
Air Lines DAL[1] trimmed its forecast for fourth-quarter 2018 adjusted total revenue per available seat mile 
(TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) due to below-par improvement in close-in yield. This disappointing 
forecast was unveiled by Delta while releasing its December traffic report.European low-cost carrier, Ryanair 
Holdings RYAAY[2] also released its December traffic numbers in the past week. Strong demand for air travel led to 
improved traffic results. Latin American carrier — Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A GOL[3] — too featured in the 
news by virtue of its fleet modernization efforts.In another notable development, Qatar Airways bought a 5% stake 
in China Southern Airlines ZNH[4]. The move is aimed at fortifying Qatar Airways' foothold in the Chinese 
market.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declined 2.7% in the past week, mainly due to Delta's 
bearish guidance.(Read the lastAirline Stock Roundup here[5])Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. 
Shares of Delta declined more than 8% on Jan 3, following its bearish fourth-quarter unit revenue view. 
The company now expects adjusted TRASM to increase approximately 3% on a year-over-year basis. This 
compares unfavorably to the previous guidance which had called for an approximately 3.5% rise in this key 
metric.In fact, this was the second time that Delta had trimmed its fourth-quarter unit revenue forecast in a short 
span of time. In December, the carrier said that it expects unit revenues to rise 3.5% compared with the 3-5% 
improvement predicted in October (read more: Delta Stock Plummets on Q4 Unit Revenue View Cut[6]).Delta 
carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks 
here[7].2. At Ryanair, traffic (including 0.3 million from its LaudaMotion unit) rose 12% year over year to 10.3 
million. This European low-cost carrier's passenger growth, excluding traffic from LaudaMotion unit, was only 9% in 
the month. On the punctuality front, the company scored impressively in December. According to the traffic report, 
more than 81% of Ryanair's flights arrived on time (read more: Ryanair Posts Increase in December Traffic, Load 
Factor Flat[8]).3. GOL Linhas plans to expedite its fleet renewal process with Castlelake and Apollo Aviation by 
replacing 13 Boeing 737 Next Generation (NG) aircraft with Boeing 737 MAX-8 aircraft in the next few years. The 
sale of these 13 737-800 NGs will cut down the Brazilian carrier's net debt by approximately R$1.1 billion. The 
revved-up fleet renewal process on account of favorable market conditions will take place during the 2019-2021 
period. (read more: Gol Linhas' Stepped Up Fleet Renewal Plan to Reduce Debt[9]).4. Southwest Airlines' LUV[10] 
co-founder and chairman Emeritus Herbert D. Kelleher expired at the age of 87. Kelleher co-founded the airline in 
1967 with Rollin King. He became chairman of the company in 1978 and chief executive in 1981. Kelleher's 
contribution toward making Southwest a renowned low-cost carrier in the United States is noteworthy.Price

Dec 20, 2018( FFT.ie: http://www.fft.ie Delivered by Newstex)  149k passengers are expected to travel through 
Cork Airport this Christmas and New Year, with Friday, 21st December expected to be the busiest day for arrivals. 
The figure is a 3.5% increase compared to the same period last year. The growth has been driven by new and 
extended routes and services added this winter season, including Ryanair's new winter service to Faro, Portugal, 
along with the commencement of the airline's London Luton route. Aer Lingus has also added capacity with its new 
Lisbon route, which commenced in October, as well as increasing frequency on its Tenerife service to twice weekly. 
Air France's daily service from Cork to Paris Charles de Gaulle, which commenced in May, has also added to the 
airport's capacity. While 21st December is anticipated to be the busiest day for arrivals, Friday 28th December is 
expected to be the busiest day overall for both arrivls and departures. Cork Airport is hosting over 30 school and 
adult choirs throughout December, a mixture of gospel, traditional and orchestral. Head of Communications at Cork 
Airport, Kevin Cullinane, said: '2018 has been a fantastic year of growth for Cork Airport, and we extend our thanks 
to our customers, airlines and stakeholders. Over 2.4m passengers passed through Cork Airport this year, our third 
consecutive year of growth. This will rise again in 2019 by a further 7% to 2.6m, with the airport serving over 50 
routes across the UK, continental Europe and the east coast of the USA.'

Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY) from a strong sell rating to a buy rating in a research note released on Tuesday. They 
currently have $83.00 target price on the transportation company's stock. 
According to Zacks, "Ryanair is being aided by strong demand for air travel, especially due to low air fares. Notably, 
traffic in November rose 11% year over year. We are also impressed by Ryanair's efforts to reward shareholders in 
the form of share buybacks. In tune with this, the carrier returned more than €540m to shareholders in the first six 
months of fiscal 2019. The positive sentiment surrounding the stock is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
for third-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings being revised upward more than 100% in the last 60 days. We remain positive 
on the collective deals signed by the company with German Pilot union. On the flip side, continued labor unrest, 
high costs and other headwinds are expected to hurt Ryanair's results in third quarter. The stock has shed more 
than 28% of its value so far in the year mainly due to the labor unrest."RYAAY has been the subject of a number of 
other research reports. BidaskClub downgraded shares of Ryanair from a buy rating to a hold rating in a research

https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/ryanair-holdings-plc-logo.jpgZacks Investment Research[1] upgraded shares of 
Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY) from a strong sell rating to a buy rating in a report issued on Tuesday morning. Zacks 
Investment Research[2] currently has $83.00 price objective on the transportation company's stock. 
According to Zacks, "Ryanair is being aided by strong demand for air travel, especially due to low air fares. Notably, 
traffic in November rose 11% year over year. We are also impressed by Ryanair's efforts to reward shareholders in 
the form of share buybacks. In tune with this, the carrier returned more than €540m to shareholders in the first six 
months of fiscal 2019. The positive sentiment surrounding the stock is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
for third-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings being revised upward more than 100% in the last 60 days. We remain positive 
on the collective deals signed by the company with German Pilot union. On the flip side, continued labor unrest, 
high costs and other headwinds are expected to hurt Ryanair's results in third quarter. The stock has shed more 
than 28% of its value so far in the year mainly due to the labor unrest."Several other equities research analysts 
have also recently issued reports on RYAAY. BidaskClub raised Ryanair from a sell rating to a hold rating in a 
report on Tuesday, October 9th. UBS Group reaffirmed a buy rating on shares of Ryanair in a report on 
Wednesday, August 15th. ValuEngine[3] raised Ryanair from a sell rating to a hold rating in a report on Monday,

August 16th. Finally, Macquarie started coverage on Ryanair in a report on Tuesday, November 27th. They issued 
an underperform rating on the stock. Two equities research analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, seven 
have given a hold rating and three have issued a buy rating to the company's stock. Ryanair has an average rating 
of Hold and an average target price of $83.00.NASDAQ:RYAAY[4] opened at $73.54 on Tuesday. The company 
has a current ratio of 1.25, a quick ratio of 1.25 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.62. The stock has a market cap of

United Continental Holdings'subsidiary — United Airlines — expanded its partnership with Copa Holdings and 
Avianca to strengthen its Latin American presence. On government's approval, this customer-friendly joint business 
agreement (JBA) is anticipated to create more opportunities related to economic development.Delta Air Lines also 
grabbed headlines by virtue of its tepid unit revenue outlook for the fourth quarter of 2018. The carrier now expects 
unit revenues to grow approximately 3.5% year over year in the October-December period. 
The previous outlook had projected fourth-quarter unit revenues to increase in the 3-5% band.Meanwhile, Ryanair 
Holdings, which has been plagued by labor-related issues for quite some time, received encouraging tidings on the 
labor front. Notably, this European low-cost carrier reached a preliminary agreement with a union covering its 
German pilots to ink collective labor deals by early next year.(Read the lastAirline Stock Roundup for Nov 28, 
2018[6])Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories1. The proposed JBA between United Airlines, Copa 
Holdings and Avianca is anticipated to facilitate travel experience between the United States and 19 countries in 
Central and South America. The joint venture will allow U.S. passengers to enjoy a smooth connectivity to Latin 
America with new nonstop routes and ramped up services on the existing ones apart from reduced travel time. 
(Read more: United Continental Arm Inks Deal to Boost Latin American Base[7]).2. At Ryanair, November traffic 
(including 0.3 million from its LaudaMotion unit) rose 11% year over year to 10.4 million. However, load factor 
remained unaltered at 96%. Passenger growth, excluding traffic from LaudaMotion unit, was only 8% in the 
month.According to the traffic report, more than 88% of Ryanair's flights arrived on time. Additionally, the deal with 
pilots has ensured that there will be no strikes in Germany at Ryanair. (Read more: Ryanair's November Traffic 
Rises Amid Low Airfares[8]).3. At Delta, November's consolidated traffic — measured in revenue passenger miles 
(RPMs) — came in at 16.83 billion, up 4.2% year over year. Meanwhile, consolidated capacity (or available seat 
miles/ASMs) climbed 3.8% to 19.62 billion. Moreover, consolidated load factor or percentage of seats filled by 
passengers expanded 40 basis points (bps) to 85.8% as traffic growth exceeded capacity expansion.The carrier 
also recorded an on-time performance (mainline) of 83.2% and a completion factor (mainline) of 99.9%. 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: United Continental , Copa, Delta , Ryanair and American Airlines
Approximately, 15.5 million passengers boarded Delta in the month.For fourth-quarter 2018, the company 
anticipates earnings per share at the high-end of the guided range of$1.10-$1.30. The Zacks Consensus Estimate 
for the same stands at $1.23. Revenues (excluding third party refinery sales) are now estimated to augment 
approximately 7.5% in the ongoing quarter. However, this projection is slightly lower than the previous view of an 
8% increase. During the same period, Delta expects to generate higher pre-tax margins owing to dwindling oil 
prices and its measures to curb non-fuel costs.Delta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list 
of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[9].4. At American Airlines Group, the issue involving a 67-year-
old woman, Olimpia Warsaw, took an ugly turn with the carrier contesting the claims of the elderly passenger's 
family that she was left alone overnight at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport following the cancellation of her 
flight on Nov 30, 2018.After investigating the claims, American Airlines reportedly[10] said that closed-circuit 
television footage of the event showed that the woman was alone for a little more than an hour after the Detroit-
bound flight was cancelled. Per the footage, the lady used a walker twice to go outside to smoke during the 
time.Media

UK regulator seeks to force Ryanair on strike compensation

— Britain's airline regulator is seeking to force Ryanair to pay compensation for flights that were cancelled or 
delayed by a series of worker strikes after Europe's biggest discount carrier said it wasn't required to pay thousands 
of claims under European Union rules. The Civil Aviation Authority says it has begun enforcement action against 
Ryanair after the airline ignored the regulator's ruling that the strikes were not 'extraordinary circumstances' as 
defined by EU rules. Airlines aren't obliged to pay compensation for delays caused by extraordinary events such as 
bad weather.The regulator also says Wednesday that Ryanair has terminated its agreement with an arbitration 
service hired to settle disputes over compensation. As a result, anyone who has filed a claim will have to wait until 
the enforcement action is completed.

Ryanair strikes deal with German pilot union

Dec 04, 2018( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair 
has struck a deal with the German pilots' union which has been one of its most vocal foes during a year of industrial 
disputes, strikes and cancellations.Ryanair has announced that it has reached agreement with the German pilot 
union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) over wages, benefits and working conditions.The four-year deal comes following a 
lengthy period of tensions and negotiations between the Irish budget airline and the union, which represents many 
of the carrier's German-based pilots.The deal includes provisions on pay, pensions, pilot allowances and annual 
leave, but detailed documentation on the agreement is not expected to be available until the end of February.Read 
more: Ryanair seeks soft landing as strikes continueCrucially, the agreements will apply German labor laws and not 
Irish labor laws — where Ryanair is based — for the airline's German-based pilots. This demand to apply local 
labor laws has been a central sticking point in the many industrial disputes that have beset the airline over the past 
year.News of the agreement follows a deal struck last month between Ryanair and the German trade union Verdi, 
which applies to German-based cabin crew. 
That deal also confirmed that German labor law would apply in their cases, as well as delivering pay increases over 
the next two years.Calm after the stormSince a major cancellations crisis in late 2017 was followed by several 
industrial disputes across Europe for Ryanair throughout 2018, the airline has been trying to reach agreement with 
various trade unions — a far cry from its previous policy of not recognising the workers' groups.The agreement with 
VC is a particularly significant one, given that the union has consistently been at loggerheads with Ryanair. A 
number of German-based strikes have hit Ryanair over the past year, while Michael O'Leary, CEO of Ryanair, has 
regularly decried VC as a "Lufthansa trade union."Talks between the pair had previously broken down on several 
occasions but the latest deal reflects the renewed urgency with which Ryanair has approached industrial disputes in 
recent months, with a view to ending the uncertainty which has beset it with regard to potential strikes.Ryanair 
recently agreed deals with unions in Ireland and Italy and also has accepted demands from Spanish unions to hire 
local staff there on Spanish contracts.Ryanair's motivation to strike deals has no doubt been influenced by a fall in 
its share price and the fact that the airline was moved to issue a profit warning back in October.

Dec 04, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1] posted impressive November traffic figures primarily owing to low airfares. Traffic (including 0.3 million 
from its LaudaMotion unit) rose 11% year over year to 10.4 million. However, load factor remained unaltered at 
96%. This European low-cost carrier's passenger growth, excluding traffic from LaudaMotion unit, was only 8% in 
the month.Successful launch of Ryanair's winter schedule also aided results. 
On the punctuality front, the company scored impressively in November. According to the traffic report, more than 
88% of Ryanair's flights arrived on time.Good News on the Labor FrontRyanair has been plagued with labor-related 
problems for quite some time. In fact, labor unrest has been primarily responsible for the stock shedding 21.8% of 
its value year to date. Its industry[2] has declined 12.4% in the same timeframe.Year-to-Date Price 
PerformanceHowever, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) carrier has received encouraging tidings on the labor front 
when it agreed provisionally[3], with a union representing its pilots in Germany, to sign collective labor deals by 
March 2019. The contracts, covering issues like pay, pension, pilot allowances and annual leave, will be inked per 
the German labor law.The union has also agreed on the fact that its members will not go on strike until the contracts 
are signed. Ryanair should breathe a sigh of relief on this news piece as it dispels fears of its operations being 
crippled 
due 
to 
strikes

Dec 04, 2018( The Today File: https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/ Delivered by Newstex)  BERLIN (AP) — 
A union representing German pilots says it has reached a preliminary agreement with Ryanair to sign collective 
labor agreements by early 2019 and that won't be any further strikes until then. The Ireland-based budget airline 
has seen strikes by various groups of employees in recent months. Ryanair built its low-cost business model 
without unions, but said last year that it would recognize them.Germany's Cockpit union said Tuesday that the two 
sides intend to sign four agreements based on German labor law by March, and that an employee council will be 
set up. It added that 'until then, no industrial action will be taken.' The union said that, by February, all pilots based 
in Germany will be subject to contracts under German rather than Irish law.

Body
Nov 26, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Due to multiple 
headwinds, shares of Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[1] have lost 30.5% in a year's time compared with the 
industry[2]'s decline of 7.9%.Reasons for Dismal PerformanceEscalating fuel costs are anticipated to dent Ryanair's 
bottom line. The company apprehends fuel bill to rise by more than €460 million in fiscal 2019 (ending Mar 31, 
2019) from fiscal 2018 figure. The significant increase is expected to be a major drag on earnings. 
Moreover, labor costs are also anticipated to increase on ratification of the recently inked labor deal with the Irish 
pilots, thereby weighing on the bottom line. Investments on its fleet are also raising costs.Moreover, the company is 
concerned about a Brexit-related impact. Ryanair anticipates that U.K. shareholders will be treated as non-EU. 
Recently, U.K. prime minister Theresa May and her cabinet approved a Brexit deal with the European Union (EU). 
The U.K. is set to leave the EU on Mar 29, 2019. The company further apprehends that the Open Skies agreement 
might not be operational after 2020Furthermore, Ryanair's labor agitation continues to cause numerous flight 
cancellations that are hampering bookings. In the previous week, infuriated passengers lodged complaints against 
the carrier for charging them fines. The customers could not check in online due to website failure. Persistent labor 
unrest, high costs and other headwinds are expected to hurt the company's results.Additionally, the stock's 
valuation is not attractive. The company's trailing 12-month price-to-book ratio of 3.1 compares unfavorably with the 
industry's figure of 2.5.Bearish Readings ...cks RankThe negativity around the stock can be gauged from the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate being revised 26.5% downward in the past 60 days for current-quarter earnings.Ryanair 
carries an unimpressive VGM Score[3] of C. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the 
score is a weighted combination of all three scores.The bearish Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) carried by Ryanair 
reflects these headwinds. The unfavorable rank implies that investors should get rid of the stock from their 
respective portfolios. In fact, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 are likely to underperform the broader market 
over the next one to three months.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Transportation[4] 
sector are CSX Corporation CSX[5], Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC[6] and Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. HTZ[7]. 
While Norfolk Southern and Hertz Global carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), CSX sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Nov 25, 2018( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  Holiday giant Thomas 
Cook is expected to lay bare the impact of a European heatwave and a fall in demand for last-minute trips abroad 
when it unveils falling profits next week.A consensus of City analysts expects the firm to post a 15% dive in 
underlying operating profit to 280 million for the full year to September. It comes after the FTSE 250-listed group 
said earlier this year that an 'unprecedented' prolonged period of hot weather across the continent meant more 
people spent June and July enjoying the sunshine at home and put off booking holidays abroad. 
However, Thomas Cook's current trading performance should have improved or at least stabilised since it warned 
over profits in September. Since then, holiday bookings for European destinations have not waned, broker Numis 
said, despite fears of a potential hard Brexit. Kathryn Leonard, analyst at Numis, said: 'The data suggests that 
demand has improved since Thomas Cook last reported. 'Indeed, the growth of keyword search terms versus the 
prior year have, on average, improved by circa 5% in the UK and by circa 17% in the Nordics.' Adding credence to 
the data, budget carriers easyJet recently said that forward bookings for next summer are 'slightly ahead' of this 
summer, while Ryanair said Brexit had not affected demand from UK or European consumers for travel. Numis said 
the comments from airlines are 'supportive for the wider UK-listed travel sector, as investors remain vigilant of any 
slowdown in demand and later booking cycle', which would negatively impact profitability and working capital. But it 
still flagged Brexit as a 'key risk' for next year's figures. The travel sector has been struggling lately due to ambiguity 
around Brexit, rising costs and slowing demand with recent profit warnings from Ryanair and Flybe, which last week 
put itself up for sale. However, easyJet shrugged off strike woes and surging costs to notch up a 41% jump in 
annual profits last week. Read more: Thomas Cook profits to slump after difficult summer[1] [ 1]:

Nov 23, 2018( evo: http://www.evo.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  Among the less enjoyable aspects of working at 
evo - buffing mud off a car in the middle of a hailstorm on a Welsh mountain; losing sensation in your buttocks on a 
Ryanair flight; failing to find a reliable driving partner on a launch event and having to share a car with a Brexit 
enthusiast from the Clacton Daily Bugle - trying to turn a seven-feet-wide sports car around between two muddy 
banks to make another pass for a photographer lurks somewhere towards the top of the list. A First World problem, 
I know, but it is one unknown to drivers of the Renault Twingo GT[1]. In this car you almost seek out opportunities to 
take a wrong turn, just so you can twirl the car around in what feels like its own length and fire off in the opposite 
direction, chased by turbo whooshes, gear whine and the parp of a three-cylinder exhaust note. The Twingo is to 
multi-storey car parks what a Rothmans 956 is to the Nordschleife, and it turns the to and fro of a magazine 
photoshoot into something to relish. > Volkswagen Golf GTI review[2] At this one particular task it's even better than 
the latest arrival in its class, the Volkswagen Up GTI[3]. Prior to the Twingo GT most manufacturers had abandoned 
the idea of the hot city car, so the GTI is welcome new competition. 
We're clearly not alone in our excitement about it, either, because if you wire your VW dealer the cash, you'll be 
tapping your fingers for nearly a year before an Up GTI is delivered. SEAT[4] and Skoda[5], who make their own 
versions of the Up, have said they won't be building Cupra or vRS versions because 'there isn't enough demand', 
which seems a bit like Decca Records telling the Beatles that guitar groups 'are on the way out'. Image 3 of 
11Image 3 of 11In five-door form, an Up GTI comes in at 100 less than the five-door-only Twingo's 14,250, but 
13,750 gets you the three-door version seen here. Neither VW nor Renault has been able to squeeze a powerful 
four-cylinder engine into their smallest model, so each has resorted to tweaking an existing sub-litre turbocharged 
three-cylinder. As such, the VW sports a 113bhp, 999cc motor and the Renault a 108bhp 898cc unit, each 
representing a useful 20bhp-or-so jump over the next model down in the range. Both cars now scrabble to 62mph in 
under ten seconds, the Up managing the dash in 8.8sec and the Renault in 9.6.From here they differ. The Renault's 
engine is sited between the rear wheels and drives through a five-speed manual 'box, and the space this liberates 
at the front is a clue to the hilariously tight turning circle. VW, a brand with plenty of rear-engined heritage, places its 
engine up front - more like its second people's car than its first. The Up is shorter, wider and taller than that original 
Golf, but everything from the stocky shape to the surprisingly similar power and performance figures can claim 
inspiration. The GTI loses some of the base Up's charming, Apple-like simplicity, but counters with a 15mm lower 
stance over cartoonish 17-inch wheels, a subtle aero kit and the obligatory red GTI pinstripes. Shooting a black car 
at night causes much consternation for photographer Andy Morgan, but the GTI's chiselled shape looks effortlessly 
cool slinking through Cambridge during its darkest hours, street lights, road signs and shop fronts reflecting off its

flat sides and glass tailgate. Image 4 of 11Image 4 of 11You hop into the Up, the enormous door apertures and 
high-set, flat, bolstered seats inviting a slightly more carefree entry and egress than most performance cars. There's 
a trio of instruments, picked out in crisp white letters with sharp red needles. A calming red glow radiates from an 
overlap in the dashboard, too, though during the day the red and black graphical pattern splashed across the Up's 
dash is less successful. There's a slim-rimmed steering wheel from the Golf GTI, and also the familiar Jacara tartan 
fabric - albeit stretched over what appear to be standard Up seats. Predictably, everything feels like it'll still be 
operating as intended when Up GTIs are the same age Mk1 Golfs are today. I made the mistake of going for a drive 
in my old 106 Rallye before the Up was delivered, and it left me frosty towards the VW for the first few miles. Why is 
the steering so numb? Why is the brake pedal so soft, and why do I need clown shoes to be able to heel-and-toe? 
And why, for pity's sake, are modern cars so damn large? That's all a little unfair, of course. The 106 is made from 
tinfoil and held together with Brie, whereas Volkswagen has, in many respects, found a way to build and sell a Golf 
GTI[6] for half the usual price. And it's still great fun. The Up GTI scampers around like a tot-hatch should, the 
steering finding weight and precision once you move a little further away from the straight-ahead, and finally filtering 
messages to your palms when the front tyres begin to scrub in harder cornering. There's grip, but not so much that 
it feels endless, and there's roll, but not so much that you feel all at sea. The wheels sometimes feel like they lack 
control over sharper bumps and compressions, and the front tyres sometimes scrabble for grip, but this encourages 
you to learn the car's limits and work within them. I'd expected to be annoyed by the lack of seat support, too, but to 
my surprise found I was driving the Up limbs-splayed like in an old Mini, and revelling in the space you have to shift 
your body, almost as if you can adjust the car's behaviour like you're riding a motorcycle. Image 5 of 11Image 5 of 
11The three-pot is a joy. Some have complained about the artificially enhanced noise filtering its way into the cabin, 
but given the raison d'tre of a car like this is to make you feel like you're going fast even when you're not, I'm all for 
it. The 1-litre begins working hard from around 2000rpm, and the growling builds from 3000rpm through to the 
6000rpm red line, doing that baby 911 impression that people can't help mentioning when talking about three-
cylinder engines. You can select gears as quickly as your arm will shift the lever of the six-speed manual 'box, and 
only at maximum revs does the engine 'hang' momentarily between gears and disrupt progress. The Twingo cuts a 
slightly different form to that of the Up. More cutesy, less geometric. It appears shorter (it isn't), taller (it is) and 
depending on the angle you're viewing it from, either narrower or wider (it's basically the same width). It too packs 
17s under each arch - and could do with sitting an inch or two lower over them - but brings its own detailing to the 
party, with a pair of exhaust outlets at the rear, a small air intake vent on the nearside flank, and contrasting 
cladding around the wheelarches and along the sills. As outside, so within. The Renault's cabin is cheerier, with 
splashes of white leather and orange fabric to distract the eye from the cheap 'n' chunky grey plastics, and an 
amusingly large semi-circular speedometer that at night competes with the central touchscreen for the most 
distracting glow. If you've missed mechanical noise in recent small cars then the Twingo GT might be for you. The 
starter whirrs momentarily before the engine grumbles into life, producing more vibration than its rival despite being 
physically further away. The gearshift's throw is longer and slightly more obstructive, and accelerating through the 
gears the whooooo of a turbocharger, eeeeeeee of gear whine and brrrrruuuuuuugggghh of the exhaust all 
compete for your aural attention. Renault has placed its pedals correctly, and the basic driving position is good, too. 
You sit high, but because the floor is also high and the windscreen close, the overall effect is actually less MPV-like 
than in the Up. The Twingo then face plants the next two hurdles: there's no rev counter, and while, like the Up, it 
lacks a clutch footrest, there isn't any room to rest your left foot at all. Image 6 of 11Image 6 of 11Even if the GT 
was incapable of generating decent cornering forces this would soon get tiresome (and after a few hours behind the 
wheel the aches begin to set in), but the Renault has surprising levels of grip. Surprising, initially at least, because 
the steering tells you virtually nothing, particularly around the straight-ahead, where it's even less talkative than that 
of the Up. There's little self-centring either, which sees you making lots of small adjustments to keep the car in your 
intended direction and means turn-in is a mixture of experience and guesswork. The front tyres do bite and they do 
hang on, but by that point you've discovered everything the Twingo's dynamics have to offer. However you drive, 
neither end of the car will budge under provocation, so the basic hot hatch joy of an adjustable chassis is denied to 
you. Drive quickly and you'll feel the GT's electronic systems cutting in continually, trimming understeer here and 
preventing wheelspin there. The ESP can't be fully disabled, which is no doubt sensible given the car's young and 
possibly inexperienced intended audience, but you feel like a child who's allergic to everything because their 
parents never let them play outside in the dirt, denied that basic need to learn from your mistakes. When we arrived 
in Cambridge, evo content editor Jordan Katsianis had spent the day behind the Twingo's chunky wheel and 
summed it up perfectly: 'You know how we sometimes describe cars as working best at eight-tenths? This feels like 
Renault Twingo GT vs Volkswagen Up GTI - can small cars do big fun?
a four-tenths car.' Driven with the utmost smoothness, the Twingo is quick, grippy and probably matches the Up for 
cross-country pace. Invest any more in terms of speed or technique, though, and the electronics call time on your 
fun. If you were hoping the rear-engined layout would give the GT a level of expression denied to front-drive rivals, 
you'll leave disappointed. The GTI is set on the safe side, too, rapidly braking individual wheels before it'll adopt an 
old-school VW tripod stance through a corner. You can't turn the ESP off here, either, but the Up feels less 
restricted by its systems, even if it ultimately lacks dynamic depth itself. But put simply, the Up is more fun more of 
the time, while its styling and cabin detailing ramp the desirability factor well clear of the likeable but slightly toy-like 
Renault. With manufacturers shying away from fun, performance-orientated superminis, both these cars should be 
celebrated for bucking that trend. For now, Volkswagen has the upper hand over its rivals. L Volkswagen Up GTI

Irish airline Ryanair has been taken to task over its new cabin baggage policy. A German consumer group will ask 
the government to intervene over what it called confusing information causing price increases.Germany's 
Federation of German Consumer Organisations (vzbv) has accused Ryanair of providing misleading information 
and insufficient pricing information about its new cabin bag policy which it brought into effect in November."All 
passengers are entitled to bring one small personal bag on board which must fit under the seat in front of you 
(40cm x 20cm x 25cm). Examples include, handbag, laptop bag and small backpack," the Ryanair website indicates 
for non-priority passengers.The weight of the bag is not indicated.Only passengers who have bought "Priority 
...Cabin Bags" or Plus/Flexi/Family tickets can bring an additional bag on board. It must fit into the baggage sizer 
"not exceeding 10kg and dimensions 55cm x 40cm x 20cm." 
A charge of €6 ($6.8) is payable at time of booking, or €8 if it is added after booking for the priority booking. The two 
bags are then listed as "free."For non-priority passengers, there is no charge in the top line but €8 is marked for the 
10kg bag at time of booking or €10 if added after booking.Challenging for consumersThe vzbv is a non-
governmental organization acting as an umbrella for 41 German consumer associations. It intends to appeal to the 
government over the new policy which it considers an indirect increase in the price of a ticket on the carrier: "The 
new regulation is completely intransparent and unexpected," said Kerstin Hoppe, a legal expert at the vzbv. "The 
restriction on hand luggage leads to an indirect increase in the price of the ticket."Rules on hand luggage at Ryanair 
are among the strictest in the world. They have been gradually tightened as first roller cases were put in the hold, 
albeit at no extra charge, and then they were followed out of the cabin by larger back packs and bags.Read more: 
Ryanair suffers first profit slump in 5 yearsThe vzbv says Ryanair fails to provide consistent information about the 
new baggage rules during the booking process and on the website. The bag is variously described as "a small 
piece of luggage", or "a small piece of luggage 40cmx20cmx25cm" or "a small bag that fits under the seat in front of 
you.""It is therefore completely unclear what kind of luggage can be taken on board for free" vzbv said in its 
statement. "Also any statment about the weight of the permitted luggage is missing."Call for clarityHowever, 
Ryanair's communications chief rejected the accusations: "These claims are not accurate," said Robin Kiely, who 
claimed all conditions, fees and additional services were shown transparently on the website."All Ryanair 
passengers can take a piece of hand luggage into the cabin, the size of which has been increased by 40 percent to 
40cmx20cmx25cm," said Kiely. "No airline customer has the right to an unlimited number of carry-on items — for 
safety reasons. Most short-haul aircraft have no room for two pieces of hand luggage per passenger."Marion 
Jungbluth, Head of Mobility and travel team at vzbv said the Federal government should "quickly check which bag 
can be carried as an essential part of a flight without additional costs, and prevent the anti-consumer policy at

Ryanair."A range of airlines have started to charge for additional services on flights. Ryanair passengers have also 
complained they were charged a €55 fee for checking in at the airport when they said the website for online check-

Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedInAfter four cabinet ministers handed in their resignations and with the 
Conservative Party in the UK moving in the direction of challenging Theresa May's premiership, stocks in Britain 
and Ireland slumped and the pound sterling took a significant hit, having seen itsvalue against the euro drop by 
1.9%. The UK stock market plummeted at the close of the last week, which saw The Royal Bank of Scotland stock 
drop by 9%, and the FTSE 250, as a whole, by 1,6%. The Irish stock market also closed 3.83% down, with the 
worst performing stocks being Ryanair (-7.9%) and the Bank of Ireland (-6.6%), adding further proof to the fact that 
the Irish economy is the most exposed to the UK economy. Analysts believe the pound could continue to slideamid 
further uncertainty arounf Brexit. 
On Novmeber16, both the pound and stock marketsappeared to gain some ground as May was continuing to 
weather the storm from the criticism she's received for the Brexit deal that she signed with the EU earlier last week. 
May has vowed to hold her ground in the fight despite speculation that her Conservative Party colleagues will soon 
look to trigger a no-confidence vote in the hope of scuttling May's Brexit deal. British markets have long feared that 
any Brexit deal that would act as a framework for relations betweenthe UK and EU following the United Kingdom's 
withdrawal from the European Union in March 2019 would ultimately be a hardBrexit, which would essentially see 
the UK being completely taken out of the EU's single market and customs union. This has led to fears that both 
tradeand value chains could be disrupted. There is, however, an awareness that the alternative to the 
Conservative-led government is the prospect of a government led by Labour's radical leftist leader,Jeremy 
Corbyn,whose ownprogrammewould include he nationalisation of key industries, including rail, water, and some 
parts of the banking sector. The Labour Party has made clear that the government would take control of the Royal 
Bank of Scotland, of which the British government has alreadyowned the majority shares since the 2008 financial 
crisis. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn

Nov 16, 2018( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  EasyJet is to reveal annual 
profits surging by up to 42% on Tuesday with the lowbudget airline brushing off strike action and gaining from the 
troubles beset by rivals.The focus for the new financial year however will be on guidance rather than earnings. The 
carrier recently said it expects full-year pre-tax profit to be between 570 million and 580 million, on revenue of 
around 5.9 billion. 
It comes despite strike chaos that caused easyJet to cancel thousands of flights over the summer as a result of air 
traffic control industrial action in France and Italy. Numis forecasts easyJet to report a profit of 575 million against a 
profit of 408 million the previous year, on revenue of 5.05 billion. EasyJet also expects to book a 115 million loss 
from its operations at Berlin Tegel Airport in Germany. But Graham Spooner, investment research analyst at The 
Share Centre, said easyJet's shares have had a torrid time lately, due to industrial action in France and recent 
downbeat comments about fiscal 2019. (PA Graphics) EasyJet shares have fallen by more than a third (34%) over 
the past six months. In September, easyJet indicated revenue per seat for the first half of 2018-19will decrease by 
low to mid-single digitson a constant currency basis after 2017-18 saw it benefit from the bankruptcies of Monarch 
and Air Berlin, as well as the grounding of Ryanair aircraft. Mr Spooner said in easyJet's full-year results, investors 
will also be looking out for comments on fuel costs and the company's recent expression of interest in troubled 
Italian airline Alitalia. Last month, the company submitted a revised bid in response to the new Italian 
government'ssales process for Alitalia, which was placed into specialadministration last year. EasyJet is also 
considering making a bid for rival Flybe, which recently put itself up for sale, according to the Financial Times. The 
company guided to a 2018-19 fuel bill of around1.48 billion, based on a fuel spot price range of 700 US dollars to 
760 US dollars (546 to 593) per metric tonne. Numis analyst Kathryn Leonard said with spot prices now below this 
range, she expects the company's guidance to be maintained or lowered. Read more: EasyJet to see annual profits

Nov 16, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; For Immediate 
ReleaseChicago, IL -November 16, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. 
Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the 
financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Barclays Plc BCS[1], Lloyds Banking Group plc 
LYG[2], Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[3], Next Plc NXGPY[4] and Peugeot Sa PUGOY[5].Here are highlights from 
Thursday's Analyst Blog: Theresa May Gets Cabinet Vote on Brexit Deal: Winners ...sersSpeculation over deal-or-
no-deal, series of cabinet resignations and a no-confidence vote finally compelled U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May 
and her cabinet to approve a Brexit deal with the European Union (EU). It was undoubtedly a hard-fought victory as 
the cabinet was split, with some of the ministers opposing the agreement.Bitter battles and possibility of further 
market gyrations, however, lie ahead. After all, the draft will now head to a Brussels summit where it will get the 
approval of EU leaders before getting back to the House of Commons, likely by the end of this year. 
The U.K. is set to leave the EU on Mar 29, 2019.Nonetheless, breaking the impasse with her cabinet members was 
a big step forward, and the pound's recent rally reflects that. The pound traded at $1.3054 versus the U.S. dollar on 
Nov 14, up 0.6% from its level late Tuesday. It has been quite a volatile trading session for the pound, which was at 
an intraday low of $1.2879 before climbing to the $1.30 mark. Meanwhile, the ICE Dollar Index, which measures the 
U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, slipped 0.2% at 96.80.However, the pound strength against the 
U.S. dollar hasn't gone down well with U.K.'s large caps, like oil majors and pharmaceutical bigwigs, as it makes 
their exports more expensive. The FTSE 100 is also down, as its combined revenue is either earned in dollars or 
dollar linked currencies.Meanwhile, firms that generate most of their revenues domestically and are more influenced 
by the U.K.'s current two-year high economic growth are the biggest beneficiaries.Here's a summary of some of the 
sectors and stocks in the United Kingdom that are gaining and losing from May's withdrawal pact with the EU —
Banks See Mixed OutcomeFollowing the Brexit breakthrough, FTSE's gauge of U.K. bank stocks fell nearly 1% in 
early trading, but a closer look will give you a different story. International players like Barclays Plc saw its shares 
lose 1.6% due to currency impact.Meanwhile, domestically-focused institutions like Lloyds Banking Group plc 
should now breathe a sigh of relief. After all, such banks would have been affected the most in case of any 
economic downturn owing to a no-Brexit deal.Newer firms like Metro Bank Plc and Virgin Money-owner CYBG Plc, 
in the meantime, saw their shares move north as they vie with international players.Home Builders GainRumors 
about the Brexit deal has been weighing on homebuilder stocks for quite some time now. But, now firms that build 
houses are among the best performers in the U.K., predominantly due to the Brexit breakthrough.This has surely 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Barclays , Lloyds Banking , Ryanair , Next and Peugeot
helped outweigh concerns that have been plaguing homebuilders like lack of affordability and the inability to save 
for a deposit.Drop in Oil Prices Saves AirlinesThe International Air Transport Association had expected Brexit to be 
a big setback for airlines. Needless to say, it will affect landing rights, pilot licenses and the trade of aircraft parts 
across borders.But, the recent slump in oil prices helped British airlines stay afloat and defy Brexit. Oil recently saw 
its deepest plunge in more than three years in the international market, as fears of oversupply and a weakening 
demand outlook weighed on the market. Shares of Ryanair Holdings plc, which provides scheduled-passenger 
airline services in Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Other European countries, gained 0.3%.Retailers ...r-Parts 
Manufacturers Rev UpThe prospect of the U.K. crashing out of the EU without a deal and a subsequent drop in 
pound may have resulted in higher inflation. This in turn could have squeezed the real wage and reduced consumer 
spending, something that doesn't bode well with retailers. A weaker pound, by the way, also leads to higher import 
cost for retailers.Thus, the Brexit deal helped retailers like Next Plc gain ground at a time when they are grappling 
with the encroachment of online retailers like Amazon.Carmakers like Peugeot Sa and Citroen producer PSA 
Group, in the meantime, have urged both the United Kingdom and EU to seal a deal to prevent production

Bleeds U.K. imports almost half of what it consumes. And most of the food and agricultural products are imported 
from the EU. Thus, lack of a smooth deal would have led to an increase in agricultural import prices, and eat into 
the margins of producers and grocers.Thanks to the Brexit deal, suppliers of ingredients and pre-prepared food 
such as Kerry Group plc will now have a better profit margin. The same cannot be said about media and telecom 
giants. Meanwhile, Britain's biggest free-to-air commercial broadcaster, ITV Plc has cautioned that revenues will 
start to fall, irrespective of a good or bad Brexit deal.Wall Street's Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes

Ryanair , German union ver.di move closer to labor pact
Ryanair, German union ver.di move closer to labor pact

Nov 13, 2018( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair 
cabin crew in Germany have endorsed key points of a potential job-safeguard deal with the Irish airline, the German 
union ver.di reports. The low-cost airline still objects to a works council to represent staff.The German service 
sector union ver.di said "a very large majority" of its members among 1,000 cabin attendants in Germany, including 
those on temporary hire, had voted for the proposed collective labor agreement.If finalized at late-November talks, 
Ryanair would switch the attendants to job contracts under German labor and social welfare laws to include sick 
pay and redundancy safeguards, said ver.di board member Christine Behle.Assuming the collective agreement ran 
until 2021, a typical stewardess currently receiving €850 ($930) would first get €1420 in basic pay, rising to €1650, 
and with bonuses, including flying hours, reach €2,300, said ver.di.Also included would be compensation for 
employees when Ryanair closed or shrunk its operations at airports — such as a Bremen closure in early 
November, ver.di said.Read more: Being a pilot isn't what it used to beRyanair personnel chief Eddie Wilson 
described the outcome as a "further concrete sign of substantial progress" toward reaching deals in European 
nations. Last week, Ryanair said it had reached various deals in Italy, Greece and Sweden.Outcome for pilots still 
awaitedThe proposed deal for German cabin personnel does not include some 400 Ryanair pilots represented by 
the German union Cockpit (VC), which is due to negotiate further on Wednesday.Also pending are cabin personnel 
talks involving another union, UFO, which on Monday won a Darmstadt labor court ruling that dismissed a Ryanair 
objection to a recent union warning that poor work conditions could also endanger safety.Linking 37 countriesThe 
tentative ver.di-Ryanair deal for Germany follows protests in recent months that forced multiple flight cancellations 
within Ryanair's network spanning 215 airports in 37 countries in Europe and North Africa.A major issue among 
personnel based outside Ireland was Ryanair's practice of using Irish legislation in individual employment 
contracts.Berlin to push for works council law changeAs a member of Germany's Bundesrat second parliamentary 
chamber, the city-state of Berlin said Tuesday it would seek amendment of Germany's corporate co-determination 
law (Betriebsverfassungsgesetz ) so air crew representatives can be elected to works councils.Berlin Labor Senator 
Elke Breitenbach of the Left Party said three other regional states - Bremen, Thuringia and Brandenburg - also 
backed the initiative to amend the legislation.Currently, the law spans only ground staff. 
Airborne staff can only be represented via their firm's works council when specifically agreed in employer-union 
agreements.Last month, German Labor Minister Hubertus Heil, visiting Ryanair personal at Frankfurt Airport, 
promised flight crews works council inclusion via legislative change.In August, ver-di form a new negotiating 
commission comprising nine Ryanair employees working in Berlin, Frankfurt, Düsseldorf, Bremen und Cologne and 
backed by public figures, including federal parliamentarians, as patrons.Profit warningRyanair has also been 
fighting an order by Italian regulators to suspend a charge for carry-on bags. Last week in France, it was forced to 
Ryanair , German union ver.di move closer to labor pact
repay a subsidy. In the Netherlands, the Dutch judiciary has blocked a pilot transfer from Eindhoven.In October, 
Ryanair cut its annual after-tax profit forecast through to next March to between 1.1 and 1.20 billion euros ($1.27-
$1.39 billion).ipj/rc (dpa, AFP, Reuters)

What Black Friday Means for the Airline Industry
What Black Friday Means for the Airline Industry
Zacks Investment Research

Nov 13, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  It's almost that time of 
year again where we can be thankful for family, but also thankful for cheaper flights thanks to Black Friday deals. 
Over the years, full service carriers like American Airlines AAL[1] and Delta Air Lines DAL[2], as well as smaller 
airlines like WOW Air and Ryanair RYAAY[3], have offered affordable deals for travelers. Airline companies have 
become a part of the e-commerce craze that comes during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, with more consumers 
now adding flights to their online shopping cart.What can we Expect? In the past, consumers would usually look for 
discounts on electronics or clothing during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. 
Recently however, people are also buying flights as more airlines have been offering discounts. According to 
CBS[4], last year about 48% of the deals on Cyber Monday were for hotels and vacation packages and 20% for 
airfare. Consumers saved up to 50% in a few deals, which is why airlines are offering discounts this year 
again.Alaska Air ALK[5] noted that at least 70% of consumers who booked a flight with them last year were solo 
travelers and only 25% were couples. It seems as though the demographics of the travelers booking these flights 
during Black Friday/Cyber Monday vary throughout the years. Since these airlines have more solo travelers we 
would be looking towards more of the younger working class looking to book for the upcoming holidays or any 
business trips.With any airline company, there will be competition, especially during this time of year. People are 
looking for cheap flights for the holiday season and they look to those airlines that are offering them. Even though 
these airlines offer these discounts to 'clear stock' (to fill seats on flights that otherwise may be unprofitable), 
according to Skyscanner[6], they still seem to have a rising amount of sales while successfully profiting from them. 
Consumers usually save up to 25% on flights in comparison to the actual flight price, and from last year's deals, 
consumers ended up saving more on international flights.Airline Stocks Earlier this year, airline companies were in 
a downward fall, with shares decreasing. It wasn't until late June, when the NYSE Arca Airline Index saw a 10% 
rise. October seemed to be a pretty bad month for airline stocks, seeing as Southwest Airlines LUV[7], American 
Airlines and JetBlue JBLU[8], just to name a few, all fell -21.3%, -15.1% and -13.5%, respectively. However, 
investors believe that going into 2019, these numbers will change for many major airline companies and that 
overall, the industry will be more profitable.The Consumer is Always Buying Flights Although the industry as a 
whole has been struggling over the past couple of months, consumers will always be buying flights and tickets to 
travel no matter what. So with Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals, airline companies can look towards increasing 
sales and overall better performance. It is apparent that not only do these sales entice more consumers to book 
flights, but it also allows these companies to score a lot of sales and in return make profit.As mentioned above, the 
main demographic purchasing these deals are usually millennials. According to CNBC, young people between the 
What Black Friday Means for the Airline Industry
ages of 18 to 34 would rather spend money on traveling than buy a house. Younger people want experience more 
than things, hence most, or even all, of their money going towards flights. So when these deals come around on 
Black Friday/Cyber Monday, those millennials who thrive on taking spontaneous trips are the ones purchasing 
them.Bottom Line Airlines make money, no doubt. But, they make even more when customers spend on a number 
of flights during Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals. In a nutshell, Black Friday means better outlook for the airline 
industry in the upcoming year.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global 
revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will 
produce "the world's first trillionaires," but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the 
right trades early. See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>[9]Want the latest recommendations from Zacks

Nov 12, 2018( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Wolfgang 
Rattay/Reuters Ryanair[1] passengers experienced a surprise on Thursday when their flight was grounded and 
plane impounded in France[2]because of an unpaid debt by Ryanair that left them delayed for up to five hours. 
BBC.com reports the French civil aviation authority grounded the flight at Bordeaux-Mrignac Airport as "a last 
resort" after a dispute over an unpaid debt of subsidies reached a sum of €525,000, or $590,000 dollars. The 
Independent reports the plane was impounded, and the passengers were delayed up to five hours at the Bordeaux-
Mrignac Airport. 
The French civil aviation authority told BBC.com,"It is unfortunate that the state had to take such action, which led 
to the inevitable inconvenience of the 149 passengers on board the immobilized plane."  Ryanair passengers 
experienced a surprise on Thursday when their flight was grounded and plane impounded in France due to an 
unpaid debt by Ryanair that left them delayed for up to five hours, multiple sources have reported. According to The 
Independent,[3] Ryanair flight 1783, a Boeing 737, was scheduled to fly from Bordeaux-Mrignac Airport in France to 
the city of Stansted in the United Kingdom at 6 p.m. on Thursday with 149 passengersonboard. But that did not end 
up happening. UPI[4] reports Ryanair passengers, who had already gone through passport control and security, 
were about to pass through the tarmac to board the plane when they were told to turn around and head back to the 
gate. BBC.com[5] reports the French civil aviation authority grounded the flight at Bordeaux-Mrignac Airport as "a 
last resort" after a dispute over an unpaid debt of subsidies reached the sum of €525,00o, or $590,000 dollars. 
Read More: Ryanair fires 6 crew members after a staged photo went viral of them sleeping on the airport floor[6] 
According to[7] BBC.com, the dispute of subsidies had to do with Ryanair's use of Angoulme Airport in France in 
2008 and 2009 and payments made to the airline, which were later ruled to be illegal by the European Commission 
in Brussels.  CNN[8] reports a 2015 European Commission statement said, "France must now recover the 
incompatible aid from the companies that received it in order to restore the level playing field." UPI reports[9] the 
payments were deemed illegal because "they gave Ryanair an unfair economic advantage." Ryanair did not 
respond to Business Insider's request for comment. The Independent reports[10] the plane was impounded, and 
the passengers were delayed up to five hours at the Bordeaux-Mrignac Airport. After being given €5 vouchers by 
Ryanair, the passengers were forced to take a later flight to Stansted that arrived at 11:30 p.m. BBC.com 
reports[11] theFrench civil aviation authority said,"It is unfortunate that the state had to take such action, which led 
to the inevitable inconvenience of the 149 passengers on board the immobilized plane."  NOW WATCH: Why you

Nov 12, 2018( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  AP Black Friday[1] is 
perhaps the single most famous and historically important day of the year for retailers in the US. Major airlines such 
as Delta[2] and Ryanair[3] have also begun to offer discounted flights and vacation packages on Black Friday. Most 
airlines are expected to begin posting their Black Friday deals a day or two before Thanksgiving. 
Black Friday is perhaps the single most famous and historically important day of the year for retailers in the US. 
Last year, retailers did $5 billion in Black Friday business just in online sales alone. However, the Friday after 
Thanksgiving is more than just cheap TVs and discounted laptops. Airlines have been jumping into the fray with 
tempting deals of their own. Everyone from full-service carriers such as American and Delta to ultra-low-cost 
operators like Ryanair and WOW Air havehinted at deeply discounted fares. Based on the deals airlines offered last 
year, they'll probably be worth the wait. For example, in 2017, WOW Air offered $100 one way flights between the 
US and Europe while Ryanair knocked 20% off their normal prices. In addition, there will also be deals on vacation 
packages consistingof both flights and hotel accommodations. Last year, Southwest cut the prices of their vacation 
packages by up to $250 for Black Friday. This year, airlines are expected to start posting Black Friday flight deals a 
day or two before Thanksgiving which falls on November 23. Here links to a few airlinedeals pages you should

View original post here[2]. A Ryanair plane scheduled to fly to London was seized by French authorities on 
Thursday over the low-cost airline's failure to pay local authorities€525,000 euros (US$595,000) in subsidies, 
reports theDaily Mail[3].  Photo: Björn Van Der Velpen The dispute arose after French subsidies paid to Ryanair 
between 2008 and 2009 in exchange for providingflights between Angouleme and London were deemed illegal. 
The airline had paid approximately half of the subsidies, leaving an outstanding balance. The French civil aviation 
authority halted the departing Boeing 737, removing 149 London-bound passengers before seizing the plane. 
The de-planed travelers had to wait five hours before being able to resume transportation from the Bordeaux-
Merignac airport on another Ryanair plane. "This measure was taken as a last resort by the French authorities after 
several reminders and attempts to recuperate the money failed," said the DGAC civil aviation body, adding "By this 
action, the government reaffirms its intention to guarantee the conditions of fair competition between airlines and 
between airports." Until Ryanair satisfies the outstanding balance, the plane "will remain immobilized," said one 
official, adding that it was "regrettable" that the passengers on board the plane had to wait five hours. Regional 
newspaper Charente Libre reported that the airline owes the regional authority 525,000 euros ($595,000), the paper 
said on its website.  French airport official Didier Villat told Sud Ouest newspaper: 'To my knowledge it's the first 
time a Ryanair plane has been seized in this way.  'Just because we manage a little airport in Charente it doesn't 
mean we are not going to defend ourselves.'  A spokesman for the DGAC, France's aviation authority, said: 'By this 
act the French state reaffirms its desire to guarantee the conditions of fair competition between airlines and its 
airports. -Daily Mail[4]  Ryanair's fleet is comprised primarily of Boeing 737-800 aircraft, which sell for more than 
$90 million each.  The airline came under investigation by EU anti-trust authorities in October, after it emerged that 
it may have unfairly benefitted from measures at a German airport which give the Irish low-cost carrier a 
disproportionate advantage over competitors. Meanwhile, ministers from five European governments last week 
warned Ryanair that they may find themselves in legal trouble if it fails to address national labor laws following a 
series of strikes across the continent.Compounding the airline'swoes is a battle with Italian regulators who ordered 
the 
airline 
to 
stop 
charging 
passengers 
for 
carry-on 
bags.

Aviation authorities in France seized a Ryanair plane for unpaid state aid. The French said they had warned the 
Irish airline it had to pay back illegal subsidies and that they were holding the plane as a "last resort."French 
authorities impounded a Ryanair plane at Bordeaux Airport in order to recoup state aid paid to the Irish airline, 
aviation authorities said on Friday.The 149 passengers were heading to London were already on board and had to 
disembark when the aircraft was seized on Thursday evening, the airport said.France's Directorate General for Civil 
Aviation (DGAC) said the passengers were delayed five hours but made it to their destination with a later Ryanair 
flight.It was "regrettable" that the plane had to be impounded "as a last resort" after several efforts to get Ryanair to 
repay the subsidies had failed, the directorate said.In 2014, the European Commission said Ryanair had to pay 
back €858,000 ($973,000) worth of rebates and marketing arrangements it received at Angouleme airport. 
The airline owes the regional aviation authority €525,000, the Charente Libre newspaper reported.DGAC said it the 
plane "will remain immobilized until the sum is paid." Ryanair's fleet is made up mainly of Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 
which have a list price of more than $90 million each.The EU also ordered authorities to recoup money from 
Transavia over benefits they had received at two other French regional airports.Last week ministers from five 
European governments warned Ryanair that it could face legal trouble if it ignores national labor laws after a series 
of strikes across the continent. av/sms (DPA, AFP)Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of

Nov 09, 2018( The Today File: https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/ Delivered by Newstex)  PARIS (AP) — 
French authorities have seized a Ryanair plane and forced 149 passengers to disembark because of a dispute over 
subsidies to the Irish airline. The French civil aviation authority said Friday it had impounded the plane on the 
tarmac of the Bordeaux-Merignac airport as a 'last resort.'Ryanair did not publicly comment on the seizure. In a 
statement, the aviation authority said France had repeatedly tried to get Ryanair to pay back regional funds paid to 
the airline in 2008-2009. The European Commission later ruled those funds illegal, saying they gave Ryanair an 
unfair economic advantage.It was not immediately clear how much money French authorities were trying to reclaim 
from Ryanair.The airline uses Boeing 737-800 planes, which cost $102.2 million each when new. Airlines often get 
deep discounts and - like a car - the value goes down as the plane ages. The aviation authority called it 'regrettable 
that the state was forced' to evacuate the plane Thursday. It said the passengers were put on another Ryanair flight 
five hours later.

group of passengers on a Sriwijaya Air flight almost came to blows with the crew over the foul and smelly presence 
of durian fruit,[1] which temporarily grounded the plane, according to multiple reports. CNN reports that a Sriwijaya 
Air flight, headed from Bengkulu, a province in Sumatra, to Jakarta, Indonesia[2] had to be grounded after 
passengers refused to board the plane that was carrying two tons of durian fruit. According to USA Today[3], the 
airline eventually heeded the passengers' request and removed the fruit from the plane, which departed an hour 
later than scheduled. 
Durian fruit is a notoriously foul-smelling fruit, that earlier this year forced an Australian University to evacuate 
because it smelled like gasoline. A group of passengers on a Sriwijaya Air flight almost got in a fight with the crew 
over the foul and smelly presence of durian fruit, which temporarily grounded the plane, according to multiple 
reports. CNN[4] reports that a Sriwijaya Air flight, headed from Bengkulu, a province in Southwest Sumatra, to 
Jakarta, Indonesia had to be grounded after passengers refused to board the plane that was carrying two tons of 
durian fruit. Durian fruit is a notoriously foul-smelling fruit that earlier this year[5] forced an Australian University to 
evacuate because it smelled like gasoline. Not surprisingly, passengers about to take their seats on the Sriwijaya 
Air flight could not handle its presence in the cargo section of the plane and refused to board. Read More: Ryanair 
fires 6 crew members after a staged photo went viral of them sleeping on the airport floor[6] CNN reports [7]the 
airline tried to placate passengers by placing coffee powder and pandan leaves over the boxes containing the fruit 
to absorb the smell, and told passengers the smell would go away once the plane was airborne. But passengers 
refused to board, chanting and yelling in unison, with the BBC.com[8]reporting some "almost came to blows with 
crew members." According to USA Today,[9] the airline eventually heeded the passengers' request and removed 
the fruit from the plane, which departed an hour later than scheduled. One can only imagine how bad the smell of 
Durian fruit is to create this scene between an airline and its passengers. The late Anthony Bourdain once 
said,[10]"Your breath will smell as if you'd been French-kissing your dead grandmother." According to Kristen 
Lee,[11] a writer for Gawker Media, the fruit has a pungent odor: "I honestly cannot remember the taste very much, 
because the smell stabbed into my nostrils like a rancid meat poker, blinding me against all my other senses. I also 
cannot describe that smell to you now because I have blocked it from my mind, but I can tell you that it was 
Bad."NOW WATCH: The science behind the viral videos of mounting tires with a controlled explosion[12]See Also:

floor of an airport in Spain,[2] according to multiple reports. The Guardian[3] reports that a collection of Ryanair 
flights were grounded in the Malaga Airport in Spain on October 13 because of storms in the Portuguese city of

reports a group of eight pilots and 16 cabin crew members who arrived at the airport shortly after midnight had to 
spend several hours at the airport, and that the delay was caused by Hurricane Leslie. The Irish Times reports that 
the Ryanair employees had to spend "the night in the crew room at the airport" after being unable to book a hotel 
room in the Malaga region. According to CNN,[7]on October 14 a photograph started surfacing of the employees 
sleeping on the floor. CNN reports[8] that security cameras in the airport took footage that showed a number of

that they were 'forced to sleep on the floor' of the Malaga crew room, which was behaviour which damaged their

in October from the Portuguese Union SNPVAC that was published by CNN,[10] "The stranded Crew, in a gesture 
of protest, took a photo that immediately became viral: Laying on the floor was the only option to rest; their 'suitable 
accommodation.'" Ryanair has pushed back on this characterization. While Ryanair told Business Insider they had 
nothing to add from their original statement, CNN reports[11] Ryanair has said the staffers only spent a short time in

Nov 07, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[1] posted impressive October traffic numbers despite numerous flight cancellations due to ATC staff 
shortages, inclement weather and labor-unrest. Traffic in the month (including 0.5 million from its LaudaMotion unit) 
rose 11% year over year to 13.1 million, while load factor remained unaltered at 96%. Traffic numbers were driven 
by cheap air fares.Success of the Laudamotion unit's summer schedule also aided results. However, excluding 
traffic from LaudaMotion unit, this European low-cost carrier's passenger growth was only 7% in the month.In 
October, Ryanair had to cancel more than 300 flights due to winter storms and a five-day airport handler strike at 
Brussels Zaventem as well as some adverse weather conditions (winter storms). Also, the carrier's service in the 
month was disrupted by the ATC staff shortages in the UK, Germany and France.Continued labor unrest, high costs 
and other headwinds had impacted Ryanair's results in the first half of fiscal 2019 (ended Sep 30, 2018), disclosed 
last month. 
The headwinds resulted in a 7% decline in profit after tax to €1.2 billion.For fiscal 2019, profit after tax (excluding 
Laudamotion) is projected between €1.10 billion and €1.25 billion. The carrier also remains concerned about a 
Brexit-related impact. Moreover, its fuel bill in the fiscal year is expected to be roughly €460m higher than the figure 
registered in fiscal 2018.We note that Ryanair is not the only carrier to feel the pinch of a rise in fuel costs. Its U.S.- 
based counterparts like Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL[2], American Airlines Group Inc. AAL[3] and JetBlue Airways 
Corporation JBLU[4] have also been hurt by increase in oil prices.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric 
Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake 
the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas 
guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging 
stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one 
you think.See This Ticker Free >>[5]Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today,

Nov 06, 2018( IT Pro: http://www.itpro.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  Online reservation systems for Ryanair will be 
unavailable from 5 pm on Wednesday until 5 am the next day for an "essential" upgrade, the airline said. So far, 
there is little detail as to what the 12-hour upgrade will involve, but in May the airline announced it was moving 
almost all its infrastructure to AWS from Microsoft[1]. As services on            www.ryanair.com[2] and its app will be 
down, the company is asking for customers travelling on Wednesday and Thursday to ensure they check in online 
and print out boarding passes by Tuesday 6 November. 
However, the airline usually charges 55 per-person to check-in at the airport and 20 to reissue a boarding pass. 
This will still be in force and passengers travelling between the 12-hour window that don't book online by Tuesday 
will be subject to these charges. Ryanair's Robin Kiely said: "As part of our continued digital development, a web 
closure and system upgrade will take place for 12 hours, from 17.00 on Wednesday 7 November, until 5.00 on 
Thursday 8 November, during which time our online check-in service will not be available."We sincerely apologise 
for any inconvenience caused by this upgrade, which will further improve Ryanair.com, Europe's largest travel 
website." The airline normally takes some 15,000 bookings an hour and it hasn't given much time for the 350,000 
passengers, who are already set to fly on Wednesday and Thursday to check-in online and print off boarding 
passes. Nick Ford, chief evangelist at Mendix, said that although upgrades were essential, they were by no means 
easily managed. "The interest in Ryanair shutting down its website and mobile app for 12 hours goes to show how 
business-critical applications really are," he said. "The cost of 12 hours 'downtime' quickly stacks-up, from lost 
online bookings to needing more on-the-ground check-in staff. "While it's easy to say businesses need to swiftly 
roll-out, migrate and update apps, it's quite another thing to deliver. Migrations and upgrades require organisations 
to build a system that remains flexible to adapt to changes." [ 1]: https://www.itpro.co.uk/cloud-

Delta , easyJet , and the Italian Government Show Interest in the Worst Airline Ever
Delta, easyJet, and the Italian Government Show Interest in the Worst Airline 
Ever
The Cranky Flier

Nov 06, 2018( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  It's been well over a year since 
Etihad pulled the plug on its failed Alitalia experiment. That left Alitalia — officially known here as the worst airline 
ever — without a lifeline as it hemorrhaged what precious cash it had left. The airline was living on borrowed time 
with cash infusions from the state, and there were big plans to sell it off to the highest bidder. 
That process has taken far longer than anyone hoped, but we're now one step closer thanks to real bids that have 
come in[1], including a surprising one, reportedly, from Delta.Last April, I expressed an interest in buying Alitalia[2] 
for a penny, as long as you all agreed to absorb the debt. There were 32 others who were interested[3] as well, but 
those have mostly fallen by the wayside. Since that time, the sale was put on hold as Italy struggled to build a 
coalition government to rule. Then the state started talking more about further nationalizing the airline. Delays kept 
piling up.While this silliness has been going on, every other airline in the country has been eating Alitalia's lunch. In 
2017, Ryanair was the biggest airline in Italy[4] with more than 36 million passengers (up 11 percent). Meanwhile 
Alitalia shrunk 5 percent down to just shy of 22 million passengers. That was followed by easyJet with more than 16 
million passengers (like Ryanair, up 11 percent). As you can imagine, this means Alitalia's short-haul business is 
evaporating. Probably its best strength right now is its dominant position at close-in Linate airport in Milan, but that's 
a fortress position that could easily be replaced if another airline had the chance to come in.The long-haul isn't 
much better. Air Italy — backed by Qatar because that airline apparently likes the Etihad 'lose a ton of money' 
strategy — has reoriented away from its niche leisure long-haul market to become an airline that wants to sit on top 
of Alitalia with flights like Milan to New York. Other airlines are starting to dig deeper into Italy too, such as 
American announcing it would fly from Philly to Bologna next year.So what is Alitalia's purpose? It doesn't have 
one, but the government mistakenly thinks it needs to exist because of national pride and well, no other reason. 
With that backdrop, it's no surprise that of the original 32 bidders, only 3 remain. (I should note my offer to pay a 
penny as long as the debt is wiped down still stands, but it isn't counted in these numbers.)Let's start with the 
government. It has decided to use the state rail company to push forward a plan. There was some talk previously 
about synergy between planes and trains, but that's just another scheme cooked up by politicians who don't 
understand the airline industry. This route would undoubtedly end in another bankruptcy. It's just a matter of how 
long it takes.Then there's easyJet. Looking at those numbers above, you can understand why easyJet might be 
interested. It looks at Alitalia the way it looked at airberlin. It could pick at the carcass and build up its Italian 
operation, creating a great base of operations at Linate. This acquisition would also make a much more formidable 
competitor to Ryanair. The long-haul piece of the business probably doesn't really interest easyJet.Lastly there's 
Delta , easyJet , and the Italian Government Show Interest in the Worst Airline Ever
Delta. Delta is a well-run company, so it should be running away screaming. But Delta does love its equity stakes. 
This is different in that most airlines in which Delta invests are at least solvent with a chance of future success. 
Something tells me that Delta made about the same offer I did. I would be surprised if anything happened with Delta 
here at all. Of course, there could be a collaboration where Delta and easyJet agree to split pieces and focus on the 
parts they want. But then there's that national pride issue again. I just don't see the government being willing to do 
the right thing here.Were I a betting man, I'd put my money on the rail company. Why? Because it makes no sense 
and wouldn't help the airline survive in the long run. That being said, it would be the biggest win for national pride. 
In the meantime, Ryanair and easyJet will continue to gobble up the short-haul traffic while Air Italy will fight Alitalia 
to see who can lose more money as they bash each other's heads in. Words cannot express how much I love 
following this airline. [ 1]: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-01/alitalia-attracts-easyjet-delta-bids-

(AP) — A court in the Netherlands has banned Ryanair from transferring 16 pilots overseas following the closure of 
its base in Eindhoven, saying the move appeared to be a reprisal by the budget carrier for strikes by Dutch 
employees. The court in Den Bosch ruled Thursday that although the pilots' contracts are based on labor laws in 
Ryanair's home country of Ireland, the carrier cannot ignore Dutch regulations.In a statement, the court says that 
choosing Irish labor law 'does not mean that an employer can deprive employees of the protection offered by Dutch 
law.' Ryanair had argued that closing its operations at Eindhoven Airport was a commercial decision, but the court 
says it appears to be 'a sanction for earlier strikes.' Most Read Business Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4

Brexit: engage panic mode
Brexit: engage panic mode
EU Referendum
October 30, 2018 Tuesday 2:06 AM EST

Length: 1435 words

Oct 30, 2018( EU Referendum: http://www.eureferendum.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  As recently as April last, 
transport secretary Chris Grayling was staunchly denying[1] that commercial airlines would be grounded after 
Brexit. At that point, he was claiming that his fellow EU ministers "snort with derision at the idea", reinforcing a 
stance he had been maintaining consistently since the previous October when he had clashed[2] with chancellor 
Philip Hammond over the issue. Hammond had maintained it was "theoretically possible" that a failure to reach an 
agreement with the EU could halt air traffic between Britain and the 27 member states after Brexit, an assertion that 
had Grayling declaring that it was "inconceivable" that aircraft could be grounded. Now, a year later - almost to the 
day - the transport secretary is finally admitting[3] that flights "could be disrupted" after all. 
But in that event, he argues, it will be the fault of the EU for refusing to start talks on a new aviation deal. This, the 
Guardian notes, represents "a marked change in tone" from previous statements, although Grayling is only 
grudgingly acknowledging that there may be problems. Speaking at the Airport Operators Association annual 
conference, he used Hammond's words, telling delegates that it was "theoretically possible" that EASA could refuse 
or delay the certification of UK-certified aircraft. But he thought it was "highly unlikely".However, Grayling's laid-back 
approach is failing to impress airline industry members. Derek Provan, chief executive of the airports group that 
includes Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton, says: "'Unlikely' doesn't really help the planning process. There's a 
lot of time, energy and cost in contingency planning".Low-cost airline Ryanair, whose CEO Michael O'Leary has 
always been up-front about Brexit risks, is warning investors that, "Depending on the outcome of negotiations 
between the UK and the EU, there remains a distinct possibility that there may be no flights, for an unknown period 
of time, between the UK and the EU from the end of March 2019".This adds to the report [4] a few days ago that 
Heathrow's operating company had raised 1.6 billion in loans to tide it over in the event that the airport was forced 
to shut down for a period as a result of Brexit. This had, in fact, been picked up by the Financial Times[5] in July, 
and recorded at the time by this blog[6]. But only now, months later, has the general legacy media noticed the story, 
even though it was (and remains) a significant development. As significant is the evidence given to the Public 
Accounts Committee[7] by Lucy Chadwick, director general at the Department for Transport. Acknowledging that 
agreements on air services between Britain and the EU comprised "an area of growing concern to us", she then 
admitted that, "We have not been able to start those bilateral or multilateral discussions yet with either member 
states or with the Commission".So, as it stands, we have a situation where, with exactly five months to go to Brexit, 
we at last have a grudging admission from the secretary of state that we have problems in the aviation field, 
together with an admission from a departmental civil servants that we've made no progress at all in trying to resolve 
them.  Since we are not even talking to the relevant parties, we have not even begun the process of drawing up a 
"bare bones" agreement, which would give us basic air services after Brexit. The scene is being set for a complete 
Brexit: engage panic mode
shut-down on Brexit day.For all that, making delayed admissions rather seems characteristic of this government's 
approach to Brexit, where it is consistently playing down the likelihood of their being any problems, consistently 
reciting the mantra that we expect a good deal, even where the evidence indicates otherwise. We even have a 
situation where the official "technical notices" on preparations for a "no deal" Brexit barely concede issues about 
which the Commission's "Notices to Stakeholders" have been warning about for over a year - and this blog even 
longer. Yet, despite the emerging detail, there still seems to be an air of unreality. Where there should be alarm 
verging on panic, we have Ed Anderson, chairman of the Airport Operators Association, muttering that: "We are 
concerned at the lack of progress in this aspect of the Brexit negotiations".His "concern" though, only extends to 
wanting the swift production of a "framework agreement", and then only "to give passengers the confidence to book 
flights for next summer". Never mind that, within a few months, there is a very real possibility that the entire industry 
will collapse, with no prospect of a rapid recovery. Given the nature of the threat and the significance of Grayling's 
admission, one might have thought that the media might have made more of the news, but the chancellor's 
announcement that a 50p coin is to be minted to commemorate Brexit is getting far more coverage. News values, 
clearly, are not what they were. Needless to say, the talk of the day has been the budget speech, the first since 
1962 which has not been delivered on a Wednesday. But it is also a theoretical budget. Ostensibly set to take effect 
next April, it can only stand if there is an orderly exit from the EU, an event which seems increasingly unlikely. 
Should we crash out with a "no deal" Brexit, the speech will have been meaningless. The chancellor will almost 
certainly have to revisit his own budget. And with all the economic assumptions shot to pieces, he will also have to 
revisit austerity with a vengeance. One might have a little more confidence if there were more encouraging (or any) 
noises coming out of Number 10, but the silence is deafening. Furthermore, in two days it will be November, when a 
last-ditch European Council meeting is supposed to happen. But it shows no signs of being arranged. Thus, if the 
aviation scenario is any guide, it seems that about now is the time when we should be moving on from expressing 
mere "concern". Now seems a good time to considering entering into fully-fledged panic mode, with all circuits 
engaged. Certainly, there has to come a time we should no longer be sitting back and letting events take their 
course. This is especially so as, it seems, MPs have at last discovered what we already knew[8] - that they have no 
power to block a "no deal" Brexit. Some of the darlings have been labouring under the illusion that they have a 
"legal veto" over this, only for them to be advised that, like the rest of us, they will only be spectators if we crash out. 
They may not even be offered a vote at all if the talks don't reach a conclusion. The "no deal" scenario takes over 
by default. Nevertheless, there is little personally that any of us can do to stave off this undesirable outcome - apart 
from stocking up on essential items and investing in enhanced home security. Panic, therefore, seems the least we 
can do. We've worked hard for it, and to that much we're entitled. We deserve the right to indulge ourselves. 
Whatever else, since the government seems determined to underplay the worst effects of the Brexit to come, we 
should not only assume the worst, but assume that the worst is far worse than anything which has so far been 
admitted. Oddly, it is twenty years since Tony Blair came into office with the slogan that "things can only get better". 
They didn't, but it will probably be true to say of current events that things can only get worse. Now really is the time 
to panic - you know it makes sense. [ 1]: https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6093073/planes-will-not-be-grounded-

Companies Rule Out Interest in Alitalia , in Blow to Rescue Plan
Companies Rule Out Interest in Alitalia, in Blow to Rescue Plan

Oct 30, 2018( Voice of America: http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex)  Major companies on Tuesday 
ruled out involvement in a new rescue of Alitalia, complicating a plan led by Rome in which state-controlled railway 
Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) will bid for the airline this week and bring in partners. Alitalia was put under special 
administration last year, leaving the government once again looking to find a buyer to save the carrier. 
It will be the airline's third rescue in a decade. FS is due to present an offer for the whole of Alitalia on Wednesday 
subject to a series of conditions. FS's offer would only be a "transitional phase," a source close to the deal told 
Reuters. The source added the deal would be completed in two separate steps, with FS picking up Alitalia on set 
conditions and then, at a later stage, being joined by an Italian partner and a international one, from the airline 
sector. The source added there was very little visibility on next steps, and it was not clear which partners would join 
FS. "The situation is very messy," the source said. Earlier this month Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio 
suggested that state-controlled companies like oil major Eni , postal operator Poste and defense group Leonardo 
could all play a role in the relaunch. Di Maio, also industry minister, said that there were many private investors also 
interested in Alitalia. But on Tuesday Eni said that any suggestion that it might pick up a stake in the carrier was 
"groundless" and that it would not play a role in the rescue, a spokesperson said. Leonardo too will not join any 
relaunch of Alitalia, which has already accumulated a loss of over 300 million euros ($340.86 million), a separate 
source close to the matter told Reuters. "It would be crazy for Leonardo to enter this madness," the source said. 
Shares in the group were down almost 1.5 percent at 1600 GMT after Italian dailies had reported that the company 
would be involved in an effort spearheaded by FS. Last month Poste Chief Executive Matteo del Fante said the 
group was "not at all interested" in joining an overhaul effort for the airline. Cash drain Alitalia has cost Italian tax 
payers almost 10 billion euros over the last 20 years, more than the market capitalization of Air France-KLM, 
Turkish Airlines, Norwegian Air, Finnair and SAS added together, according to Andrea Giuricin, CEO of transport 
advisory firm TRA Consulting. Last year Alitalia accounted for only 8.5 percent of the international traffic to and from 
Italy, Giuricin added, just under a third of Ryanair's share. The sale process was delayed due to the change of 
Italian government earlier this year, but the ruling coalition, that comprises the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement 
and the far-right League, pledged it would close a deal by Wednesday. Germany's Lufthansa said earlier on 
Tuesday that it had no interest in participating in a government-led restructuring effort. Alitalia must pay back the 
Italian state almost 1 billion euros in a bridge loan and related interest by mid-December. ($1 = 0.8801 euros)

Oct 29, 2018( The Finanser by Chris Skinner: http://thefinanser.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Every now and again 
people like me are drawn back into reality. Sure, I fly business class, sometimes first, and drink champagne at 
40,000 feet. I land and stay in luxurious hotels whilst partying with a network of people who are friends, rather than 
business associates. 
I eat at fine restaurants and am treated by some as though I'm a rock star. Obviously I love all that, but the reality is 
that I get home, change nappies (not mine), sort out the rubbish and put the bins out. Equally, I fly Ryanair 
sometimes, because it's convenient, ride buses, catch the subway and eat a burger or two. We're only human after 
all. It's during some of the latter experiences that you realise how disconnected the former is from the latter. A great 
example is spending an hour or two just watching what goes on in a bank branch. Who goes there? It's small 
businesses, often a lot of elderly people, but there are also students asking about loans and millennials looking at 
mortgages. The branch is not dead by a long way. Equally, I struck up an interesting conversation with a guy who 
had just been to a funeral in his Scottish hometown, but now lives in Australia. He was with his family, travelling 
back from the funeral, and they were seeing a bit of America. I met them in Las Vegas during Money 2020 last 
week. We got to talking about work and life, and he described himself as a grafter working in the construction 
business. For those who don't know what a grafter is, it kind of means wheeling and dealing and ducking and diving 
to make a living.You have to earn a buck, and grafting is all about working hard to do just that. He was my age, and 
had three kids and a wife with him on the journey back. They were telling me how they had travelled business class 
once, and loved it, but this time had opted for premium economy as they couldn't afford it. I felt bad, as some of us 
take travelling business class for granted. I don't. It's a privilege. I know it's a privilege even when I sometimes get 
angsty about it. No one should take the champagne lifestyle for granted as it can go faster than it came. It's like the 
old saying that it takes years to build up trust but it can disappear in a second; the same is true of the champagne 
Charlie lifestyle. Just look at Philip Green. As we talked further however, it is clear that I'm also grafting. I've spent 
years building a life that came apart a decade ago with redundancy[1] and divorce. I'm thrilled to be remarried, but 
that means I still need to graft and earn, especially after losing most of my wealth in that financial rape moment 
called divorce. This is why I blog every day and travel non-stop, to enjoy a champagne Charlie lifestyle and look 
after my family, as I know it could just go 'pop' and end. Do you know this? Do you ever think about it? Do you ever 
wonder how long you could last with no income? What if you had an accident tomorrow, god forbid, or lost your job? 
How long could you last? That last paragraph is a gift for the insurance industry, who work on disturbance selling. I 
will make you worry enough to spend $1,000 a year on a product you may never use but, as the years go by, 
become more and more important to you. Take health insurance. I've not been ill once. Not seriously. A cold here 
Keep on grafting
or there, and a sore knee or toothache, and that's about it. I've been lucky. So recently I move to Poland and took 
out a new healthcare policy. It's amazing, you can see a doctor any time you want and, even better, they analyse 
and fix you there and then. It's there equivalent of private healthcare. The UK version of private healthcare is that 
you pay ten times as much to have a policy that can move you higher up the list, but only after the NHS has 
diagnosed you and say they can't deal with it fast enough. I've been with one of these healthcare providers and pay 
almost $5,000 a year for the policy today. The premiums have gone up every year and I know from friends' 
experiences that I cannot cancel it. If I do, they send me back to zero again and exclude any pre-existing conditions 
that might need diagnosis. In other words, you might have been with the healthcare provider for thirty years, cancel 
the policy because you lost your job, get a new job and try to get the policy back. They say no. It's a new policy. 
Forget those thirty years. Meantime, you got diagnosed with cancer and they'll now preclude any treatment for 
cancer from the new policy. Shoot, I know that I'm having a bit of a rant, but I've been massively surprised by how 
brilliant healthcare is in Poland compared to the UK, as illustrated by the comment above, e.g. I can open a new 
policy in Poland and have immediate access to doctors on demand from day one. So what's the point of this blog? 
Well, I'm sharing a little personal insight between my conversation in Vegas and experience in Poland to try and 
illustrate that we're all grafters. We're all trying to get by. And if you take any of your good life and champagne 
Charlie lifestyle for granted, then you've become complacent and stupid. Just look at Bernie Madoff. Keep on 
grafting guys. [ 1]: https://thefinanser.com/2018/03/made-redundant-best-thing-ever-happened.html/

shouting racist abuse at a woman on a Ryanair flight[1]appeared on British TV on Friday to defend his actions. 
Mesher was recorded yelling obscenities at a black woman whom he did not want to sit next to while travelling from 
Barcelona to London on October 19. David Mesher told Good Morning Britain that the event was "just a fit of 
temper" and that he is "not a racist person." People took issue with Ryanair's response[2], which was to relocate the 
woman. Some threatened to boycott the airline. 
Police in the UK and Spain have said they are investigating what happened. A man who was recorded shouting 
racist abuse at an elderly black woman on a Ryanair flight has blamed his actions on a "fit of temper" and denied 
that he is a racist person. David Mesher gave an on-camera interview to the "Good Morning Britain" breakfast TV 
show, broadcast Friday morning in the UK. He said:"I'm not a racist person by any means" and it was "just a fit of

saying he is not a racist and blaming a fit of temper for the incident which went viral. More:

the man abusing 77-year-old Delsie Gayle, a black woman who had been assigned the seat next to him for a flight 
from Barcelona, Spain, to London Stansted Airport on October 19. In the video Mesher is heard saying: "Don't talk 
to me in a foreign language you ugly f------ cow," and called Gayle an "ugly black b-----d." He tells her: ""I don't want 
to sit next to your face," to "move to another seat," and "if you don't get out the seat I'll push you to another seat." 
He did not explain why he did not want to sit next to her. In the TV interview Mesher said: "I probably lost my 
temper a bit and ordered her to get up." Here's the video[6], shot by fellow passengerDavid Lawrence. It contains 
strong, racist language:Youtube Embed: //           www.youtube.com/embed/exlcaG9mBmg Width: 560px Height:

launched to pressure Ryanair into compensating Gayle for her treatment[7] appeared online shortly after the video 
went viral, and has so far amassed some306,000 signatures. The petition says: "Ryanair failed to remove the man 
from the flightor to support Mrs Gayle. Insteadshe was made to move seats whilst the man was given a row to 
himself." A number of passengers have threatened to boycott Ryanair[8] as a response to what they see as an 
insufficiently robust response to Mesher. During the TV interview Mesher apologised to Gayle. Gayle and her 
daughter Carol rejected the apology shortly afterwards, the BBC reported on Friday[9]. Police in both Spain and the 
UK have said they are investigating the incident. Officers were pictured visiting Mesher's home in Birmingham,

— has apologized, and said he is not racist.Shocking video that went viral over the weekend showed David Mesher 
racially abusing fellow passenger Delsie Gayle, 77, shortly before a Ryanair flight took off from Barcelona for 
Stansted Airport near London on Oct. 19.'Don't talk to me in a foreign language, you stupid, ugly cow,' Mesher, from 
Birmingham, told Gayle in the clip. 'If you don't go to another seat, I'll put you in another seat,' he added.Watch the

Gayle, who was in the 'GMB'studio when the clip was aired, said she 'didn't think' she could accept Mesher's 
apology. 'You can forgive and forget, but it's going to take a long time for me to get over what he has done to me,' 
she said.Ryanair — a budget airline based in Dublin — was widely criticized for not immediately removing Mesher 
from the flight.Just watched the shocking footage on a @Ryanair[6] aircraft, utterly disgusting. Racist male 
passenger should have been put off flight before it departed. Flight attendant incapable of responding appropriately. 
However well done to passenger with black t-shirt that intervened #hero[7] — Margaret Ferrier SNP

MP (@KarlTurnerMP) October 21, 2018[11] Instead, a male flight attendant asked Gayle if she wanted to move. 
She initially stood her ground, but following the racist abuse later asked if she could sit with her daughter, Carol.The 
airline initially said it could not comment on the incident, citing a police probe. However, on Friday — a week after 
the flight — the company released a lengthy statement explaining itself:Ryanair statement on racist video:

'were aware of an argument between these two passengers during the boarding process' but were 'not present' 
when the racist comments were made.;'As the cabin crew believed they were dealing with an argument between

two passengers, they followed company procedure, to defuse the argument, and separate the passengers by 
offering to move one to alternative seating,' the airline said. 'In this case, the female passenger was moved at her 
request, to a seat adjacent to her daughter who was also travelling on this flight.''After moving the female 
passenger, both passengers were asked if they were 'okay', and both confirmed that they were,' the airline 
continued. 'As far as the cabin crew were concerned, that was the end of the matter, and since there was no threat 
to aircraft safety, the issue of offloading one passenger did not arise.' This article originally appeared on The

Oct 26, 2018( The Today File: https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/ Delivered by Newstex)  LONDON (AP) 
— Ryanair has sought to deflect criticism about its handling of a racially charged dispute on one of its flights by 
releasing letters showing that it swiftly apologized to the victim and referred the matter to police. The move comes 
as the man who directed racial slurs at a fellow passenger denied being a racist and apologized to the woman he 
berated on a flight from Barcelona to London's Stansted Airport.David Mesher tells ITV on Friday the dispute with 
Delsie Gayle began as he tried to get to his seat and 'probably lost my temper a bit and ordered her to get up.' 
Mesher says he regrets the language, adding 'I'm not a racist person by any means, and it's just a fit of temper at 
the time, I think.'Most Read Business Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1] [ 1]:

witnessed earnings releases from key airline players like United Continental Holdings, Inc., JetBlue Airways Corp. 
and Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.While JetBlue and Hawaiian Holdings reported better-than-expected earnings per 
share, United Continental fell short on the bottom-line front. While surging fuel costs hurt the bottom-line 
performance of all the above-mentioned US based carriers, impressive passenger revenues driven by the solid 
demand for air travel bolstered revenues.Meanwhile, low average air fares (down 3%) apart from high costs 
resulted in a 7% decline in profit after tax to €1.2 billion at European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc in the first 
half of fiscal 2019 (ended Sep 30, 2018). However, a 6% increase in traffic resulted in an 8% rise in revenues in the 
first six months of fiscal 2019. Moreover, load factor came in at 96%. During the period, the carrier returned €540 
million to shareholders through buybacks.On the non-earnings front, Alaska Air Group, Inc. announced that it will 
increase its fees for checked bags. The new fee structure will be applicable from Dec 5, 2018.Recap of the Past 
Week's Most Important Stories 1. United Continental's third-quarter 2018 earnings (on an adjusted basis) of $3.06 
per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.09. Operating revenues came in at $11,003 million,

outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, the bottom line decreased 21.8% on a year-over-
year basis primarily owing to higher costs. However, total operating revenues of $2,008 million fell short of the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,011.9 million. Nevertheless, the top line increased 10.5% from the year-ago 
figure. Passenger revenues, which accounted for bulk of the top line (96.7%), improved 10.8% in the quarter under 
review. Other revenues increased 3.5%. (Read more: JetBlue Q3 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Decrease Y/Y[8])3.

lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20 cents. Revenues of $3,207.6 million also fell short of the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of $3,217.5 million. However, the top and bottom lines improved 8.5% and 1.8%, respectively,

remains concerned about a Brexit-related impact.4. Hawaiian Holdings' third-quarter 2018 earnings (excluding 7 
cents from non-recurring items) of $1.91 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.73. However, 
quarterly revenues of $759.1 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $763.6 million. Revenues 
increased 6% on a year-over-year basis, courtesy of the new accounting standards adopted on Jan 1, 2018. 
Passenger revenues, which accounted for bulk (91.8%) of the top line, increased 4.3%. Balance came from other 
sources.Operating revenue per available seat mile in the reported quarter decreased 2% year over year. The metric 
is projected to be between down 2.5% and up 0.5% year over year in the final quarter of 2018.Capacity is projected 
to grow between 4.5% and 6.5% in the fourth quarter. The metric is expected to increase in the band of 5.5-7.5%

Oct 24, 2018( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex)  Ex-
Formula 1 champion Niki Lauda was released from a hospital in Vienna in "good overall condition" following his 
emergency lung transplant. The racing veteran still suffers the effects of crashing his Ferrari in 1976.Three-time F1 
drivers' champion Niki Lauda left the Vienna hospital on Wednesday, nearly three months after developing a lung 
infection that prompted an emergency transplant.The 69-year-old was in "good overall condition," the hospital said 
in a statement, adding that Lauda was still expected to spend weeks in "intensive" rehabilitation.The Austrian-born 
Lauda first snatched the F1 drivers' title with Ferrari in 1975. Only a year later, he crashed at Germany's 
Nürburgring Nordschleife race and remained trapped in his burning car for 55 seconds, suffering burns and inhaling 
toxic fumes.He made an astounding recovery to return to the track only 42 days later and finish the 1976 season 
second overall, behind British driver James Hunt. 
The Austrian won the championship again for Ferrari in 1977 and retired at the end of the 1979 season. However, 
he came back to the paddock in 1984, joining McLaren, and in 1985 became the sole driver ever to win an F1 title 
having returned from retirement.After his definitive retirement in 1985, Lauda made money as an entrepreneur, 
founding his own airline but later selling most of it to RyanAir. He also worked as a TV commentator and currently 
holds the title of the non-executive chairman for the Mercedes' F1 team, in which he is a shareholder.As well as his 
distinctive facial scarring, the effects of Lauda's 1976 crash caused a number of long-term health issues, prompting 
two kidney transplants in 1997 and 2005.Pulled back from the brinkIn August this year, Lauda cut short his vacation 
on Ibiza and flew home to get treatment for lung inflammation. Doctors in Vienna decided to do an emergency lung 
transplant, saying that the driver's condition was "extremely critical.""Without a transplant, life expectancy in such 
circumstances would be limited to days or weeks," Head of the Department of Thoracic Surgery Walter Klepetko 
said two days after the six-hour operation in the Vienna hospital."Considering the not very easy circumstances we 
are very, very happy with the developments," he added.Lauda's doctors are expected to hold a press conference on 
Thursday.dj/msh (AFP, AP, Reuters, dpa)

Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the last week and 
during the past six months.The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red over the past week 
leading to a 2.7% decrease in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index. Over the course of six months, the sector tracker has 
decreased 10.2% due to multiple headwinds like high fuel costs.What's Next in the Airline Space?Investors will look 
forward to third-quarter earnings reports from the likes of American Airlines, Alaska Air Group and Southwest 
Airlines Co. LUV[11] on Oct 25.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to 
consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and 
reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 
265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company 
stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free

Lines[1] Flight 589 was forced to make an emergency landing on Tuesday after suffering what officialscalled a 
broken windshield shortly after takeoff from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (MSP). In a statement to

have been reported among the 169 passengers on board the flight. 
A Delta Air Lines flight was forced to make an emergency landing on Tuesday after suffering a broken windshield 
shortly after takeoff from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (MSP). In a statement to Business Insider, Delta 
Air Lines confirmed that there was an "issue with the First Officer's window seal." However, the Atlanta-based 
carrier declined to go into detail on the exact nature of or the severity of the issue. Minneapolis-St. Paul 
International Airport officials were not immediately available for comment. But airport officials told the Minneapolis 
Star Tribune[2] that the flight suffered a broken cockpit window. According to FlightAware, Delta Flight 589 took off 
from Minneapolis at 11:23 am local time en route to Seattle, Washington. But, the Boeing 737-900 turned back just 
13 minutes after taking off and landed safely back in Minneapolis a few minutes later after air traffic control declared 
an emergency to clear the path for the jet. No injuries have been reported among the 169 passengers on board the 
flight. The Delta incident occurred just days after an Icelandair flight en route from Orlando to Reykjavik[3], Iceland 
was forced to make an emergency landing in Canada after pilots discovered a crack in the Boeing 757's windshield.  
No injuries were reported in that incident either. Here is Delta's statement in its entirety: "Delta apologizes to 
customers of flight 589 for the delay incurred after the flight returned to Minneapolis shortly after takeoff due to an 
issue with the First Officer's window seal. The flight taxied to the gate where maintenance is evaluating the aircraft. 
As always, the safety of our customers and crew is our top priority."NOW WATCH: There are a set of wheels the let

Oct 22, 2018( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Irish no-
frills carrier Ryanair has reported a decline in profits for the first half of its fiscal year. Europe's largest budget airline 
said the slump was due to repeated strikes and higher fuel prices.Ryanair's profits for the first half of its fiscal year 
fell by 7 percent to €1.2 billion ($1.38 billion), the low-cost Irish airline reported Monday.It also announced that 
average fares declined due to excess capacity in Europe."As recently guided, H1 average fares fell by 3 percent," 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement. 
"While ancillary revenues performed strongly, up 27 percent, these were offset by higher fuel and staff 
costs."O'Leary conceded that the airline's traffic was repeatedly impacted by the worst summer of strike-related 
disruptions on record, but grew by 6 percent "at an unchanged 96 percent load factor."Delays and cancellationsIn 
the first half of its fiscal year, the budget airline took delivery of 23 new B737s, bringing its fleet to 450. It launched 
over 100 new routes while trimming winter capacity, including resulting base closures in Eindhoven and 
Bremen."We cannot rule out further capacity cuts or base closures, if oil prices rise or air fares fall further," Ryanair 
said.In August, the carrier increased its holding in Laudamotion to 75 percent. Laudamotion has reached agreement 
to return nine expensive lease aircraft to Lufthansa this winter and will replace those with "lower-cost, longer-term 
operating lease aircraft."Ryanair emphasized that repeated strikes and staff shortages meant that 2018 would be 
the worst year on record for European disruptions. "These have caused widespread damage to airline punctuality 
and schedules, with Ryanair's H1 on-time [performance] falling to 75 percent from 86 percent in the previous 
year.hg/jd (dpa, Reuters)

Oct 22, 2018( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  David 
Lawrence/Facebook Ryanair[1] is getting slammed for failing to remove a white man who hurled racist insults at an 
elderly black woman on board one of its flights. Video capturing the October 19th incident has gone viral with 
members of the public chastising the lack of reaction on the part of the airline[2]. "We are aware of this video and 
have reported this matter to Essex Police," Ryanair said in a statement. Irish ultra-low-cost airline Ryanair is under 
fire after its crew failed to removea white man who hurled racist insults at an elderly black woman[3] while boarding 
one of its flights from Barcelona, Spain to London. The incident, which took place on October 19, was captured on 
video by a fellow passenger David Lawrence and has now gone viral with more than five million views on Facebook 
and another 600,000 on YouTube. 
It's unclear what, if anything, triggered the tirade. However, the video shows the man seated in a window seat of the 
Boeing 737 hurling a series of vile racist and sexist insults toward the woman in the aisle seat. According to the 
caption posted with the video, Lawrence claims the incident was a result of the man not wanting to sit next to the 
woman. The woman was eventually moved to another seat by a Ryanair crew member while the man was allowed 
to remain in his seat.Youtube Embed: //www.youtube.com/embed/exlcaG9mBmg Width: 800px Height: 
450pxRyanair has remained quietduring the whole incident, only releasing a short one-sentence statement, "We 
are aware of this video and have reported this matter to Essex Police." The reaction to the tirade on social media 
was swift and overwhelmingly critical of Ryanair, even spawning the hashtags RyanairRacism and BoycottRyanair.

is what you need to know. Trump has no intention of backing down from his trade war[1]. President Donald Trump 
wants "Chinese leaders to suffer more pain from his tariffs, the news website Axios reports, citing three unnamed 
sources with knowledge of his private conversations. Foreign investors are fleeing Saudi Arabia's stock market[2]. 
Foreigners unloaded $1.1 billion of Saudi stocks this past week as news of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi's 
suspected murder reached a fever pitch, Reuters reports. 
China announces new tax cuts[3]. The cuts, which are to take effect on January 1, allow for six new types of 
deductions that could save taxpayers tens of thousands of yuan a year, the South China Morning Post says. 
China's 'plunge-protection team' goes all in[4]. The Shanghai Composite soared 4.09% Monday — just one trading 
session after Chinese policymakers rolled out a wave of measures meant to support stocks and household 
spending. Mnuchin isn't worried about contagion from China's slowdown[5]. "I am not concerned about that 
destabilizing our markets," Mnuchin told Reuters regarding China's slowing economy, adding, 'Broadly, right now, I 
don't see a contagion risk." A secret weapon that has kept stocks afloat the past decade is vanishing[6]. The "Fed 
put," which has kept the stock market chugging higher over the past decade, is becoming less effective, and if it 
ends up vanishing, it could send stocks plummeting, according to Vincent Deluard, a macro strategist at INTL 
FCStone. Tim Cook wants Bloomberg to retract its spy-chip story[7]. "There is no truth in their story about Apple," 
Cook told BuzzFeed of Bloomberg's story claiming Chinese spies implanted tiny chips in motherboards that ended 
up being sold to the tech giant. "They need to do that right thing and retract it." Richard Parsons resigns as interim 
chairman of CBS[8]. Parsons, who replaced the CBS chairman Les Moonves following multiple sexual-misconduct 
allegations against Moonves, has resigned as interim chairman because of illness. He is being replaced by Strauss 
Zelnick, the CEO and chairman of Take-Two Interactive Software. The Boring Company's first tunnel is coming 
soon[9]. The Boring Company, which aims to lower the cost of building high-speed transit tunnels, will open its first 
tunnel on December 10, according to a tweet from CEO Elon Musk. It will reportedly run under Hawthorne in the 
Los Angeles area. Earnings reporting is light[10]. Halliburton and Hasbro report ahead of the opening bell, while TD 
Ameritrade releases its quarterly results after markets close.See Also: Ryanair is under fire for not removing a white 
man who shouted racist insults at an elderly black woman on one of its flights after video went viral[11]Your opinion

— Ryanair says its first-half profit fell 7 percent as Europe's biggest discount airline faced rising costs and flight 
cancellations due to staff shortages and air traffic control strikes. The Dublin-based carrier says Monday that profit 
before one-time items fell to 1.20 billion euros ($1.38 billion) in the six months through September, from 1.29 billion 
euros a year earlier. Net income dropped 11 percent to 1.15 billion euros.Fuel expenses increased 22 percent amid 
rising energy prices. Staff costs jumped 33 percent after Ryanair recognized unions and workers negotiated higher 
pay deals. Ryanair also warned about the increasing risk Britain will crash out of the European Union without an 
agreement on future trading relations. CEO Michael O'Leary said: 'We remain concerned that the time to complete 
such an agreement is shortening.'Most Read Business Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1] [ 1]:

Oct 21, 2018( The Huffington Post: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Scores of people 
declared a boycott against Ryanair, a Dublin-based budget airline, over the weekend after video of an apparently 
racist confrontation on a recent flight surfaced on the internet.David Lawrence, a U.K. resident,told HuffPost he 
filmed the video on Oct. 18 before a Ryanair flight FR9015, an afternoon flight, from Barcelona to the Stansted 
Airport in London.The video shows a white man yelling because he doesn't want to sit next to an elderly black 
woman. Another woman who appears to be the elderly woman's daughter scolded the man for yelling at the woman 
and asked him to 'give her a chance!'A male flight attendant tried to diffuse the situation and asked the woman if 
she wanted to sit somewhere else, to which she initially refused.As the confrontation continued, the man called his 
seatmate an 'ugly black bastard' and yelled, 'Don't talk to me in a foreign language, you stupid ugly cow!'He also 
threatened the woman with violence: 'I'll tell you this,' the man told her. 'If you don't go to another seat, I'll put you 
into another seat.'The woman eventually asked if she could go to her daughter. 
https://www.facebook.com/david.lawrencehughes/posts/1878817008897754 Lawrence posted the video to his 
Facebook page an hour after the confrontation. It has since been viewed 1 million times.Ryanair did not return 
HuffPost's requests for comment.Many people have criticized the flight staff for not kicking the man off the flight and 
for allowing the woman to move seats instead of him.Several members of British Parliament and Scottish 
Parliament have called on Ryanair to report the man to the police for his verbally abusive behavior.'He should have 
been removed from the flight and handed over to the police,' MP Karl Turner tweeted. 'We assume the aircraft was 
in the UK. If it was, he definitely committed criminal offenses.'He should have been removed from the flight and 
handed over to the police. We assume the aircraft was in the UK. If it was, he definitely committed criminal 
offences. I fully expect @Ryanair[1] to confirm the situation if In fact it was their flight?            
https://t.co/ORfww9ZiPg[2] — Karl Turner MP (@KarlTurnerMP) October 21, 2018[3] Dear @Ryanair[4], Is this 
actually one of your flights?If so, what have you done about reporting the racially abusive passenger to the Police? 
Regards, KT            https://t.co/qF3yMoytoF[5] — Karl Turner MP (@KarlTurnerMP) October 20, 2018[6] This really 
is appalling @Ryanair[7] . You will know the identity of the man and the level of training given to your staff!            
https://t.co/DyMleXQ0vD[8] — Stuart McMillan MSP (@StuMcMillanSNP) October 21, 2018[9] Where are all these 
racists morons coming from? It's like they've appeared from a hole in the ground since the Brexit vote. Come on 
let's get this disgusting man found and action taken against him. — James Dornan SNP (@glasgowcathcart) 
October 20, 2018[10] Just watched the shocking footage on a @Ryanair[11] aircraft, utterly disgusting. Racist male 
passenger should have been put off flight before it departed. Flight attendant incapable of responding appropriately. 
However well done to passenger with black t-shirt that intervened #hero[12] — Margaret Ferrier SNP 
Man Refuses To Sit Next Elderly Black Woman On Ryanair Flight To London
(@MargaretFerrier) October 20, 2018[13] Ryanair,headquartered in Ireland, has not issued any official response to 
the video.Lawrence told HuffPost that neither the pilot nor the flight attendants asked the man to switch seats or 
leave the flight after the incident occurred.'I spoke to the pilot at the end of the flight,' Lawrence said. 'He suggested 
that we make a formal complaint to Ryanair.'The budget airline has earned a reputation for being a business that 
offers only the bare minimum service, charging customers more for basic services, including printing out their 
boarding passes and group seating.Ryanair's chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs once claimed at a travel 
industry conference that the company was 'the fastest growing airline and we're low cost, mean bastards,' 
according 
to 
Quartz[14].

— Ryanair has faced criticism after a video posted online apparently showed the airline's crew failing to take action 
to remove a passenger who launched a racist tirade against a fellow traveler. The video, uploaded to social media 
by Briton David Lawrence, showed a man hurling racist insults at an elderly black woman sitting in the same row 
and demanding she move seats onboard a flight from Barcelona to London on Friday.It wasn't clear what had 
prompted the quarrel. Lawrence told ITV the man abused both the woman and her daughter, but flight attendants 
failed to eject him from the flight. The budget airline tweeted Sunday that it had seen the footage and reported the 
incident to police. It didn't provide further comment.Most Read Business Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4

Ryanair pilots and cabin staff in Germany have been promised a works council inside the Irish airline by Labor 
Minister Hubertus Heil. The budget carrier claims to have reached a deal with Portuguese pilots.German Labor 
Minister Hubertus Heil vowed Friday to close a loophole in industrial relations law that currently excludes flight 
crews from having their own voice in company corridors unless specified in their collective employer-union 
contracts.Visiting Ryanair staff in Frankfurt Friday, Heil said would ask parliament to remove the loophole from 
Paragraph 117 of the Works Constitution Act (Betriebsverfassungsgesetz) so that crews too could utilize Germany's 
widespread employee representation.For months, Ryanair has faced strikes across Europe by aviation-sector 
unions demanding that it negotiate with them as industrial partners and reach collective agreements.Entire 
government defied Heil warned Ryanair to drop its resistance to collective agreements, saying: "whoever behaves 
like that defies the entire federal government ... Exploitation must not become a business model in Germany."Martin 
Locker, head of the pilots' union Cockpit said "employers use this loophole for their own purposes."Backing for Heil, 
a prominent Social Democrat and IG Metall union member, came from Uwe Schummer, chief spokesman for 
German workers within Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative grouping in the national parliament, the 
Bundestag.Workplace representation or co-determination was a "fixed component of social freedom in our country," 
said Schummer.Heil's visit to Frankfurt Airport, came nine days before a key election in the regional state of 
Hessen, where the hub is located.Deal with Portuguese pilots?
Ryanair announced, meanwhile, it had reached a deal with Portuguese pilots on contentious seniority and home 
base issues.Alongside "signed agreements" in Portugal, Britain, Italy and "shortly Spain" - that demonstrated 
"considerable progress" on reaching agreements with unions in "our major EU markets," said Ryanair personnel 
spokesman Eddie Wilson.BALPA, the British pilots union, rejected that claim, saying Ryanair had got "itself a little 
bit over-excited" because members still had to discuss what he said only a "joint proposal.""Until the members vote 
there is no agreement," said BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton.In September, Ryanair pilots staged walkouts 
across Europe, affecting tens of thousands of passengers. On Friday, two Belgian unions warned of several more 
days of strikes in Europe if Ryanair did not change its stance.ipj/rt (AFP, Reuters, dpa)Every evening at 1830 UTC,

Oct 09, 2018( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Share on Facebook Share on 
Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedInPoland's deputy infrastructure minister Mikolaj Wild is overseeing the 
construction of a mega-airport that aspires to become Europe's gateway to the east. The Polish government plans 
for the project's completion by June 2027. The formal decision to endorse the project was made in November 2017 
and ratified by the parliament in May 2018. Criticism of the project abounds. 
Developed over 3,000 hectares, the Central Airport (CPL) will be situated between Warsaw and Lodz and will be 
the biggest infrastructural investment in Polish history. The project is projected to cost €16.5bn and handle 45 
million passengers a year, scalable to 100 million. It will be known as 'Solidarity Airport' and there wilbe second to 
none in Eastern Europe. Fully developed, CPL aspires to rival in size Heathrow. Not unlike Heathrow, the project is 
at the epicentre of political controversy. The Polish vision is to carve out for Warsaw a bigger share in the ever-
growing market of European aviation, making Poland a nodal point for Europe'sconnection to the US, the Middle 
East and the Far-East. The growth momentum is undeniable. Since 2000, Warsaw has seen its share of the 
aviation market surge from 3.5 to 10.5 million passengers a year.Still, many question the project's economic 
viability. Industry experts do not expect the EU to contribute to the airport's development, DW reports. In fact, there 
could be serious opposition to its development. The European Commission closely monitors airport projects to 
ensure compliance with State aid rules 2014/C99/03), and large airports must meet the private investor test. 
However, the Polish government claims there is Chinese, South Korean and Singaporean interest in investing in the 
project. During a 2017 visit to China, Wild suggested that CPL may be incorporated in the Belt and Road (OBOR) 
initiative. To date, there is no Chinese commitment. The Polish opposition wants the expansion of the existing 
Chopin airport and investment in the multi-modal links of the existing infrastructure, including highway railway 
connections. The main concern is that CPL will cause major socioeconomic disruption. The project will mean that 
Warsaw's existing Chopin Airport will close and a number of regional airports could end being obsolete. Similar 
objections have been raised for Heathrow Airport, with one Conservative MP resigning in 2017 when Theresa 
May's first cabinet committed to a third runway. However, unlike Heathrow, the CPL project does not seem to have 
the backing of major market players. Although the chief executive of the Polish national carrier LOT supports the 
CPL project, companies with a bigger marker share disagree. Low cost carriers Ryanair and Wizz Air oppose it, 
fearing it would increase their costs and eat into their margins. [embedded content] Share on Facebook Share on

Oct 08, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[1] has been grappling with labor unrest since the time it acknowledged trade unions last December. The 
problem intensified this July when it witnessed the first-ever pilot strike in its home market of Ireland over its alleged 
failure to meet demands regarding new working practices.Since then, several walkouts by pilots and the cabin crew 
have taken place across the European countries of Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Holland, Portugal, Italy and Germany, 
resulting in numerous flight cancellations and hampering bookings in turn.The cabin crew is primarily protesting 
against the airline's practice of a common Irish law[2] (except for U.K.-based employees) for all its employees, 
regardless of the country they are based in. The employees ask for a contract governed by the local law.The issue 
has taken a massive toll on Ryanair, forcing it to trim its guidance for fiscal 2019 (ending Mar 31, 2019). The 
European low-cost carrier now anticipates full-year profit (excluding Laudamotion) in the range of €1.10-€1.20 
billion (previous outlook was in the band of €1.25-€1.35 billion). Apart from strikes, higher costs including fuel 
induced the downbeat guidance.The successive strikes have come at a time when the entire airline industry is 
already burdened with fuel cost woes. 
Thus quite obviously, the company's fuel cost estimates for fiscal 2019 have been raised. Fuel expenses in the 
period are expected to be higher than last year's tally by approximately €460 million. Earlier, the same was 
anticipated to be €430 million dearer. (Read more: Ryanair Trims FY19 View Due to Strikes ...her 
Headwinds[3])Additionally, Ryanair remains concerned about a Brexit-related impact with leisure and business 
travel demand taking a beating. Management expressed worries that its UK shareholders will be treated as a non-
EU entity. Notably, Mar 29, 2019 is the date for the UK to leave the EU. In the event of this scenario materializing, 
Ryanair's licencing and flight rights might be hurt. Under the current ownership rules, an EU airline must have more 
than 50% EU ownership. However, Ryanair would fall short of the requisite numbers if the UK indeed exits the EU. 
Ryanair fears that the Open Skies agreement might not be operational after 2020.Amid such negativities, the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings has been revised 16.5% downward over the past 60 
days. The company's unimpressive VGM Score of C further highlights its short-term unattractiveness.Moreover, 
shares of the company have declined more than 20% so far this year due to these headwinds. Given these 
downsides, we believe, investors should discard the Ryanair stock for now. The company's Zacks Rank #5 (Strong 
Sell) only substantiates our view.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector[4] are 
Spirit Airlines, Inc. SAVE[5], CSX Corporation CSX[6] and Union Pacific Corporation UNP[7], each carrying a Zacks

Oct 03, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[1] has trimmed its guidance for fiscal 2019 due to rising oil prices, higher EU261 costs and back-to-back 
strikes.Bearish FY19 ViewThe carrier now anticipates full-year profit (excluding Laudamotion) in the range of €1.10-
€1.20 billion (previous outlook was in the band of €1.25-€1.35 billion). Ryanair gauged that the two recent strikes 
across five European countries will adversely impact the second quarter and third- quarter traffic and fares. 
Customer confidence has been largely hit by fear of potential strikes. Additionally, the strikes have resulted in 
higher EU261 care and re-accommodation expenses.Ryanair's second-quarter fares are down nearly 3% (prior 
forecast was a rise of 1%) due to soft close-in bookings and fares, primarily arising from successive walkouts in 
September. 
The carrier had earlier expected fares to recover during the third quarter. However, the current scenario says 
otherwise. Possibility of further strikes has dampened customer confidence and fares over the past week. 
Consequently, the European low-cost airline now estimates second-half fares to decline 2% from the earlier 
expectation of flat year over year.Additionally, fuel costs in fiscal 2019 will be higher than last year's tally by 
approximately €460 million. Earlier, the same was anticipated to be €430 million higher. "Other Costs" during the 
fiscal year are likely to be affected by higher EU261 care and re-accommodation costs. Also, the company 
estimates FY19 traffic to be 138 million (past view: 139 million excluding Laudamotion), reduced by sluggish traffic 
growth in the second half. Low airfares, higher oil prices as well as additional EU261 costs have forced the carrier

Oct 03, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[1] slashed its profit guidance (excluding Laudamotion) for fiscal 2019 (ending Mar 31, 
2020) due to high fuel costs, labor strife, low fares and other headwinds. This Irish low-cost carrier also witnessed a 
24-hour walkout on Sep 28, mainly by its cabin crew members in multiple countries across Europe. German pilots 
also went on strike on the same day. Consequently, travel plans of more than 40,000 passengers[2] across Europe 
were thrown haywire.Delta Air Lines, Inc. 
DAL[3] too featured in the news when it unveiled its September traffic report. Load factor (percentage of seats filled 
by passengers) declined in the month as capacity expansion outweighed traffic growth. Moreover, the company 
stated that Hurricane Florence is likely to hurt its third-quarter pre-tax income by approximately $30 
million.Meanwhile, JetBlue Airways Corporation JBLU[4] announced its intention to sell Basic Economy (cheapest) 
tickets from next year in a bid to stay afloat in the competitive airline space. Also, Southwest Airlines Co. LUV[5] 
extended its bookable flight schedule through Jun 8, 2019 as it aims to add new routes and resume some. 
Expansion-related updates from JetBlue and United Continental Holdings, Inc. UAL[6] too hit the headlines over the 
past five trading days.(Read the lastAirline Stock Roundup for Sep 27, 2018[7])Recap of the Past Week's Most 
Important Stories 1. Delta expects Hurricane Florence to weigh on its third-quarter unit revenues to the tune of 
roughly 0.5 points. Moreover, significant rise in fuel prices over the past 12 months are expected to limit bottom-line 
growth. Despite high fuel costs, Delta expects adjusted total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a key 
measure of unit revenue) to increase year over year between 4% and 5% in the third quarter (the previous view had 
projected the metric to increase in the 3.5-5.5% band). Strong demand for air travel and improving yields 
contributed to the bullish forecast.According to Delta, these favorable factors partially mitigated the adverse impact 
of sharp rise in fuel prices per gallon, which are expected to be between $2.22 and $2.27 in the third quarter. 
Adjusted pre-tax margin is anticipated to be approximately 13% (mid-point of the guided range in July). Non-fuel 
unit costs are anticipated to be roughly flat year over year. The company envisions third-quarter earnings per share 
in the band of $1.70-$1.80 (the previous view had projected the metric in the $1.65-$1.85 range).Delta carries a 
Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8].2. 
Joining the likes of Delta and American Airlines Group Inc. AAL[9], JetBlue has decided to introduce a fare class 
that will offer the cheapest tickets starting next year. Passengers booking tickets under the fare class will naturally 
have fewer options than those opting for the regular economy tickets (read more: JetBlue Follows Rivals to Offer 
Basic Economy Fares in 2019[10]).In a separate development, JetBlue announced plans to bump up its Palm

Springs service with new nonstop flights to Boston. Additionally, the carrier will extend the duration of its current 
seasonal service to New York JFK (read more: JetBlue Boosts Palm Springs Service for Winter Travel[11]).3. In a 
customer-friendly move, Southwest Airlines intends to begin a new nonstop service between San Jose and El Paso 
on Sundays, effective Apr 14, 2019. Additionally, the airline will launch seasonal nonstop flights connecting 
Cleveland with Orlando, and Milwaukee with Fort Myers. The Saturday service will start on Oct 6. While the next 
day, the company will initiate flights connecting Oklahoma City and Nashville, Denver and El Paso plus Oakland 
and Tucson. These flights will be operational only on Sundays (read more: Southwest Airlines to Add Flights 
...sume Few Services[12]).4. For fiscal 2019, beleaguered airline Ryanair Holdings expects profit after tax between 
€1.10 billion and €1.20 billion (the earlier guidance had projected the metric between €1.25 billion and €1.35 billion). 
Fuel bill is expected to be €460 million higher in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 (the earlier guidance had 
projected a €430 million year-over-year increase). In the second half of fiscal 2019, air fares are expected to decline 
approximately 2% year over year. Traffic in the fiscal year is also likely to suffer due to the strikes. Winter capacity 
has too been trimmed by 1% due to the headwinds. Adding to the gloom, Ryanair stated that it might have to trim its 
fiscal 2019 outlook further in the event of more disruptions in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.5. United Continental's 
wholly owned subsidiary, United Airlines, announced plans to enhance travel experience for customers during the 
upcoming ski season. The carrier will be offering more than 100 flights with 10,000 plus seats daily to reach 12 top 
ski destinations across the United States (read more: United Continental Proposes More Flights for Ski 
Travel[13]).In a separate development, the carrier introduced additional flights on its transcontinental routes 
connecting New York/Newark with Los Angeles and San Francisco.Price Performance The following table shows 
the price movement of the major airline players over the last week and during the past six months.The table above 
shows that almost all airline stocks traded in the red over the past week leading to the NYSE ARCA Airline Index 
decreasing 4%. Over the course of six months, the sector tracker decreased 11.1% due to multiple headwinds

Oct 02, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per Reuters[1], strikes at 
Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[2] last Friday affected more than 40,000 passengers across Europe. Cabin crews in 
Germany, Belgium, Portugal, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy staged a 24-hour walkout on Sep 28. They also 
found support in German pilots, who joined the movement.Ryanair initially cancelled 150 flights ahead of the strike. 
However, the number increased by 100 more on Thursday with the German pilots also wanting to participate in the 
protest march.The employees are primarily demanding better pay and working conditions. 
They are also against the airline's usage of a common Irish law[3] (except for U.K.-based employees) for all its 
employees regardless of the country they are based in. The working staff wants a contract governed by the local 
law.A Ryanair spokesperson defended the company stating that it has already offered (in writing) the European 
unions to implement the local law, social taxes and accept the local court's jurisdiction. However, the Belgium union 
claims to have never got the same on paper. Meanwhile, German pilots' union has hinted at more such industrial 
actions in case the carrier does not mend its ways.Persistent labor-related agitation since the time it acknowledged 
trade unions last December has been hampering bookings at the company. Consequently, the European low-cost 
carrier is reconsidering its capacity growth plan for winter and summer 2019.Amid numerous flight cancellations at 
Ryanair, its rival easyJet plc EJTTF[4] seems to gain a competitive edge from it. On Friday, the carrier forecast 
annual profit at the high end of its projection owing to robust demand and cancellations at Ryanair.Labor-related 
issues are very much the order of the day in airline space. The airline employees claim that despite the companies 
generating record profits, they lag in terms of employee remuneration. This has in turn, propelled frequent new 
labor deals across the airline industry.This July, JetBlue Airways Corporation JBLU[5] ratified its four-year 
agreement with the pilots represented by Air Line Pilots Association. Earlier in March, Spirit Airlines, Inc. SAVE[6] 
ratified its five-year deal with pilots pertaining to wage increase.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks 
has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new 
referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 
2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.See the

Nordic budget airline Primera Air has collapsed — another blow for the struggling sector
Nordic budget airline Primera Air has collapsed — another blow for the 
struggling sector

Oct 02, 2018( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Peter 
Macdiarmid/Getty Images Nordic budget airline Primera Air has become the latest European carrier to go bust. The 
European budget airline sector has been struggling for a while — Monarch went bust last year and Ryanair issued a 
profit warning this week. Nordic budget airline Primera Air has become the latest European carrier to go bust, 
saying all flights were being halted and stranding thousands of passengers. 
"On this sad day we are saying goodbye to all of you," the airline wrote in a note on its website[1] dated September 
30. Here's the message:  Primera was forced to cancel flights earlier this year, citing delays in receiving aircraft 
from Airbus, but has faced growing complaints about poor service and late refunds. The airline was planning to 
launch routes from Madrid to New York, Boston, and Toronto next year at prices as low as €149 ($172) each way. 
In Europe, legacy airlines have been fighting back[2] against low-cost rivals by operating budget carriers of their 
own, squeezing an already crowding market and driving fares lower. KLM has Transavia while sister company Air 
France has launched Joon[3]. IAG, the parent company of British Airways and Iberia, in 2012 took full control of 
Spanish low-cost airline Vueling, which services destinations across Europe. Last year, IAG launched Level, a low-
cost long-haul carrier designed to take on Norwegian and WOW. Lufthansa has been developing its Eurowings and 
Germanwings low-cost subsidiaries for the past 15 years. Primera's collapse comes a year after Britain's Monarch 
Airlines went under after falling victim to intense competition for flights and a weaker pound.[4] Air Berlin, 
Germany's second-largest airline, filed for bankruptcy protection in August 2017. Just yesterday, Ryanair, Europe's 
biggest airline by passengers, warned[5] that profit for the year would be hit by the fallout from labor strikes and 
rising fuel prices. The airline said more staff strikes could force the company to issue further profit warnings.NOW

Airport Workers Protesting Around the Globe for Fair Wages, Union Rights

Oct 02, 2018( Thomson Reuters ONE: http://www.thomsonreuters.com Delivered by Newstex)  Workers are 
protesting at airports that control nearly 36% of world air travel and serve nearly 4 million passengers 
dailyWashington, D.C., Oct. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In airport demonstrations all around the globe, 
thousands of airport workers and their supporters are putting airlines like United (UAL) on notice as they call for fair 
wages, union rights, and safe workplaces. With the support of the International Transport Workers' Federation and 
the UNI Global Union, airport workers are taking action at airports that control a whopping 36% of world air travel, 
where nearly 4 million people pass[1] through each day. This includes most of United Airlines' U.S. hubs and some 
of the world's largest airports—including LAX in the U.S., Charles De Gaulle in Paris, Schiphol in Amsterdam, 
Incheon in Seoul, and Flughafen in Frankfurt.Coming just days after Ryanair cabin crews in Belgium, Germany, 
Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain organized the most widespread strike the airline[2] has seen, today's 
protests began in Sydney, Australia and will continue across the globe through France—where strikes have been 
announced at all airports—then to So Paulo and the Western coast of the U.S., where workers at the Los Angeles, 
San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland airports will march and rally for fair pay, health care, and other benefits."It 
doesn't matter who we are or where we come from. 
Working people should be able to afford food on the table and a decent place to live,' says Behrad Ghofrani, an HR 
dispatcher at the Frankfurt International Airport in Germany. 'The profit that companies make is generated through 
the work of thousands of employees like me, so at least we should get a small share of the billions. It's time to 
connect all over the planet and rise against the airlines. It's time for Lufthansa, United Airlines and all the other big 
players to take responsibility and make sure that workers don't struggle from paycheck to paycheck.'Baggage 
handlers, security officers, cabin cleaners, janitors, wheelchair attendants, and other contracted airport workers 
provide soaring profits to the global airline industry, which is projected to net $38.4 billion in 2018, while struggling 
to make ends meet on low wages and often without benefits or paid days off. Airport jobs used to be good union 
jobs, but the global airline industry is increasingly subcontracting out to irresponsible, low-bid contractors[3] that cut 
corners on wages, benefits, and safety standards."The global airline industry is leading a race to the bottom that's 
hurting communities across the globe," says Stephen Cotton, General Secretary of the International Transport 
Workers' Federation—a global union federation of 700 trade unions representing 20 million workers in 150 
countries. "Airline companies keep coming up with new ways to drive down wages, cut benefits, and increase 
workloads. But the world's airport workers will be at every corner to fight these injustices. Our movement to win fair 
pay and union rights is catching on and spreading all over the world."Just last week, airport workers in the Service 
Employees International Union (SEIU) at SFO won a minimum wage of $17[4] an hour and 40,000 workers at JFK, 
Airport Workers Protesting Around the Globe for Fair Wages, Union Rights
La Guardia, and Newark airports won $19[5] an hour—the highest minimum wage in U.S. history. Airport workers in 
other U.S. cities are inspired by these stunning victories and motivated to come together and win the wages they 
need to provide for their families.'We help people with special needs who can't get around on their own, and really 
care about our work and the community,' says Shoeb Babu, a wheelchair attendant at Denver International Airport 
in the U.S. 'But many airport workers sacrifice a lot to do these jobs. I work two jobs just to get by. We are speaking 
out for better wages, working conditions and union rights at airports around the world.'In the U.S., nearly half of all 
airport workers are paid so little that they have to skip meals or go hungry and nearly 30% are forced to rely on 
public assistance for basic needs like food, housing, and medical care[6]. In Thailand, some airport workers are 
paid just $10 a day, which is half of the living wage for that country. Airport workers in Indonesia are only paid $1.50 
an hour—far below what it takes to cover basic necessities.'In a world where global airlines and their contractors 
are rigging the rules to benefit the wealthy few, we must confront these corporations as a united front—all together, 
around the world,' says Christy Hoffman, General Secretary of UNI Global Union. 'Contracted airport workers—
baggage handlers, janitors, and security officers—make it possible for people to travel all over the world. They are 
coming together to speak with one voice until they win the respect, wages, and rights they deserve. We know that 
when workers unite, they win, and these victories reverberate throughout the world.'United Airlines is one of the 
worst offenders when it comes to taking our tax dollars and charging excessive fees. The airline has received an 
estimated $44 billion in direct and indirect subsidies and brings in the most ancillary income, which includes 
baggage fees and reservation change fees, of any airline —$5.7 billion last year.With respect to both the wages 
and the union rights[7] of United's subcontracted workforce, the airline's practices have raised major concerns 
around racial equity. Subcontracted workers are paid a fraction of what most direct employees are paid. And while 
nearly 100% of United's non-managerial employees are represented by a union, a majority of its contracted 
workers—who are mostly people of color and immigrants—do not have those same rights and benefits. Further, 
United Airlines has a track record of actively fighting[8] subcontracted workers' efforts to exercise their right to form 
a union.Despite airlines driving a race to the bottom and attempting to divide workers along racial lines, airport 
workers have won union rights, wage increases, job protections, and other benefits by the tens of thousands[9] by 
coming together across their differences and working hand-in-hand with elected officials all across the U.S. to make 
sure that the publicly-funded aviation infrastructure works to the benefit of all people—and not just wealthy special 
interests.'Major airlines take billions in tax dollars every year. They have the responsibility—and the ability—to 
stand up for good, union jobs and to stop driving a race to the bottom at airports around the world,' says Kevin De 
León, Los Angeles State Senator and Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate. 'In California, I stand with airport 
workers who are working together in the fight to raise standards. At LAX, union airport workers doubled wages and 
won full family health care, and now are fighting back against the airlines who are trying to undermine those gains. 
Workers at SFO are now pushing for those same things. On October 2, workers will be out in force telling airlines 
they need to play a leadership role in our communities by providing good union jobs at airports in California and 
across the entire country.'As airport workers rally around the globe, higher education, hospital, child care and fast 
food workers are coming together in 'Unions for All' actions to confront major corporations who are undercutting 
unions. Fast-food workers across the Midwest are kicking off a wave of strikes[10] one month before Election Day, 
culminating in the first-ever walkout by thousands of cooks and cashiers nationwide focused directly on demanding 
the right to a union at McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and other chains.Contracted airport workers around the 
country are coming together in Airport Workers United[11], a movement of employees and their supporters raising 
their voices for fair wages and union rights to make our airports safe and secure for passengers, employees and 
our communities. By sticking together, speaking out, and going on strike 25,000 workers have joined SEIU and 
120,000 have won raises or other improvements, including healthcare, paid sick leave, and job protections.### [ 1]:

Sprich Ryanair is cutting some winter flights and temporaily removing aircraft from bases, as labor strikes led the 
company to slash its full-year profit forecast by 12%. Ryanair trimmed its winter capacity by 1%, removing aircraft 
from Eindhoven in theNetherlands, and Bremen and Niederrhein inGermany. It says more disruptions are 
possible.Profit forecasted for the year has fallen and is now expected to be between 1.1-1.2 billion euros (2 billion) 
compared with the earlier forecast of 1.25-1.35 billion euros, a 12% drop, the Dublin-based airline said. The airline 
has lowered its fares in the third quarter,particularly for the October school mid-term holiday andChristmas.Ryanair 
is cuting some winter flights and temporaily removing aircraft from bases as labor strikes led the company to report 
a bleak full-year profit forecast. 
Ryanair, the largest low cost-carrier in Europe, pojected a 12% fall in profit due to raised oil costs and September 
strikes from pilots and cabin crew across Europe, the company said. The airline said it could not rule out further 
disruption and another cut to forecasted profits, with reduction in winter flights.  Winter flights are often operated at 
a loss. Ryanair has trimmed its winter capacity by 1 percent, temporarily removing aircraft from its Eindhoven, 
Bremen and Niederrhein bases, and it has lowered fares. Since recognizing unions in late 2017, strikes have 
escalated against Ryanair with bosses and unions making slow progress in talks.The strikes led to cancelled flights 
and reduced revenue, while rising oil prices also hit the airline.Profit for the year is now expected to be between 1.1-
1.2 billion euros (2 billion) compared with the earlier forecast of 1.25-1.35 billion euros, a 12% drop, the Dublin-
based airline said.'While we successfully managed five strikes by 25% of our Irish pilots this summer, two recent 
co-ordinated strikes by cabin crew and pilots across five EU countries has affected passenger numbers (through 
flight cancellations), bookings and yields (as we re-accommodate disrupted passengers), and forward air fares into 
Q3.' said Ryanair chief executive, Michael O'Leary. Shares of Ryanair plunged 8.8% on Monday. But the company 
said that most flights will continue as normal. "All affected customers have been contacted by email/SMS this 
morning and will be re-accommodated on other flights or refunded as they so wish," Ryanair said.NOW WATCH:

Oct 01, 2018( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  The Irish 
low-cost carrier has slashed its profits forecast and signaled job losses in the Netherlands and Germany, saying 
worse may come if recent coordinated strikes across Europe continue to hit traffic and bookings.As a result of 
recent walkouts by pilots and cabin crew, the Irish airline has cut its annual net profit forecast by 12 percent, saying 
it now expected the figure to come in between €1.1 billion ($1.28 billion) and €1.2 billion, compared with its prior 
estimate of €1.25 billion to €1.35 billion. Moreover, Ryanair announced it would leave eight aircraft on the tarmac as 
of November 5 — equivalent to a 1.0-percent reduction in its winter capacity. 
At its Eindhoven, Netherlands, base all four aircraft would be grounded, as well as its two planes stationed in 
Bremen, Germany. In addition, two out of five aircraft would be removed from its base in Niederrhein, also in 
Germany."We will now consult with our pilots and cabin crew at these three bases to minimize job losses," Ryanair 
said in a statement on Monday.The affected staff would be offered vacancies at other Ryanair bases, and unpaid 
leave would be introduced to "minimize cabin crew job losses" amid a "large surplus" of crew during the winter 
schedule.Read more: Being a pilot isn't what it used to beThe profit warnings come three days after cabin crew and 
some Ryanair pilots walked out in Germany, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.Tit-for-tat?After 
Ryanair recognized labor unions for the first time in December, workers have been seeking higher wages and an 
end to the practice whereby many are being employed as independent contractors without the full benefits of staff 
employees."Two recent coordinated strikes by cabin crew and pilots across five EU countries have affected 
passenger numbers, close in bookings and yields, and forward air fares into Q3," Ryanair chief executive Michael 
O'Leary said in a statement.Ryanair fares in its second quarter to end-September have fallen by around 3 percent, 
compared with its previous forecast for a drop of 1 percent. In the second half of 2018, the airline expects fares to 
be 2 percent lower.Read more: Ryanair seeks soft landing as strikes continue"Customer confidence, forward 
bookings and Q3 fares have been affected, most notably over the October school mid-terms and Christmas," 
O'Leary noted.The airline also said it wouldn't rule out further disruptions in the coming months, possibly requiring 
another downward revision of full-year forecasts and further cuts to its loss-making winter capacity.While Ryanair 
has struck some deals with unions — last week, for example, with cabin crew unions in Italy, who can now enjoy 
employment contracts under Italian law — it has yet to reach agreement in other countries.uhe/aos (Reuters, AFP,

— Thousands of travelers in Europe saw their plans disrupted Friday after airline Ryanair cancelled more than 200 
flights because of strikes by cabin crew in Spain, Belgium, Holland, Portugal, Italy and Germany. The budget airline 
says it had informed passengers of possible disruptions ahead of time, giving them time to adjust.In Tenerife, 
Spain, hundreds of passengers queued at Ryanair counters and dozens more at the Madrid airport as 86 flights of 
the low-cost company from or to Spain were cancelled, affecting some 16,000 passengers, according to Spanish 
unions. 
The unions blame the Ireland-based company for breaking talks over the company's ratio of outsourced workers, 
working conditions and their demand for local contracts instead of Irish ones. Most Read Business Stories Unlimited 
Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1]In a statement Thursday, the company blamed cabin crews of competitors for 
organizing the strikes and blocking 'significant progress' in labor negotiations.But the Brussels-based European 
Cabin Crew Association, which says it has more than 35,000 members, supported the walkout over what it 
described as the airline's 'inflexibility, single-mindedness and unreasonable behavior.' The association alleged 
Ryanair was intimidating strikers by threatening them with job losses.As the company and labor groups traded 
accusations, some passengers left on the ground by the cancellations were galled. 'They (Ryanair) sent me a text 
saying, 'Have a look at your email.' I don't have an email,' said Eddie Hughes from Norfolk, England, at Madrid 
airport. Spanish cabin crew workers' unions said cancelations could be increasing throughout the day. Airports in

Sep 28, 2018( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Scott Olson / Getty 
Images Good morning! Here is what you need to know on Friday. 1. The Securities and Exchange Commission is 
suing Tesla CEO Elon Musk [1]on charges that he made "false and misleading statements" and wants to bar him 
from helming a public company. The SEC says the charges stem from Musk's tweets about taking his electric-car 
company private at $420 a share, a claim he tweeted to his 22 million followers[2] on August 7. Tesla shares fell as 
much as 11%[3] in after-hours trading on the news. 
2. The US Senate Judiciary Committee will vote on Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court on Friday 
morning[4], after a day of contentious hearings during which Christine Blasey Ford testified about her claim that 
Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her, and Kavanaugh testified in his own defense. If the committee's confirmation 
vote on Friday lands in Kavanaugh's favor, then senators would move forward with a procedural vote on the Senate 
floor Saturday. That could potentially set up a final confirmation vote next week. 3. The dollar rose against peers, 
advancing to a nine-month high versus the yen[5], after data reinforced upbeat views about the US economy and 
backed the Federal Reserve's signal for a steady course of rate increases over the next year. US gross domestic 
product grew at a 4.2% clip in the second quarter, the fastest in nearly four years, according to government data on 
Thursday. 4. Ryanair is bracing on Friday for another strike by staff [6]as walkouts in six European countries, mainly 
cabin crew, force flight cancellations that will disrupt the plans of more than 40,000 travellers. Europe's largest low-
cost carrier has faced a string of strikes since it recognized trade unions for the first time in December, damaging 
bookings and forcing it to consider cutting short-term growth plans if labor unrest continues. 5. Streaming service 
Netflix plans to double its investments in France[7] and produce 14 local shows, twice as many as previously 
planned, chief executive Reed Hastings said Friday. Hastings did not disclose how much Netflix would invest in 
France, though it would be "many millions of euros", he told French radio station BFM Business. 6. Italy's 
government on Thursday targeted the budget deficit at 2.4% of gross domestic product[8] for the next three years, 
defying Brussels and marking a victory for party chiefs over economy minister Giovanni Tria, an unaffiliated 
technocrat. Tria had initially wanted a deficit set as low as 1.6% next year, hoping to respect European Union 
demands that Italy progressively cut the fiscal gap to rein in its high debt. 7. Global mergers and acquisitions 
dropped [9]to $783 billion in the third quarter, down 35% from the prior quarter, as the escalating trade dispute 
between the United States and China cast a shadow on the financial and regulatory prospects of some deals. 8. 
Britain's biotechnology industry has raised a bumper 1.56 billion ($2.05 billion) in the first eight months of this 
year,[10] surpassing the 1.2 billion reached in the whole of 2017, despite anxiety in the sector about the fallout from 
Brexit. The increase has been fueled by recent changes to venture capital tax incentives, according to UK 
10 things you need to know in markets today
BioIndustry Association (BIA) CEO Steve Bates, as well as global investor enthusiasm for drug discoveries 
emanating from biotech labs. 9. Macquarie Bank CEO Nicholas Moore has been implicated [11]in a financial 
investigation by German authorities. The inquiry concerns a complex dividend trading scheme that is currently the 
subject of civil litigation. In a statement to the ASX this morning, Macquarie said the Cologne Prosecutor's Office is 
expected to speak with at least 30 senior staff members involved in the deal. 10. Sword-wielding headhunter: A 
senior executive at one of Wall Street's top recruiting firms was arrested for allegedly slashing a bride with a sword 
[12]after a dispute broke out. Luckily, the bride suffered non-life threatening injuries to her arm. The man, however, 
now faces multiple charges and has been suspended without pay, pending the result of the investigation.NOW

Ryanair seeks soft landing as strikes continue

Sep 27, 2018( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  The 
Irish low-cost carrier has in 2018 become synonymous with strikes. While the airline has managed to operate the 
overwhelming majority of its flights, reputational damage has been unavoidable.In the not-too-distant past, there 
were always a few people wary of booking Ryanair flights for rather epicurean reasons.An insufficiently fluffy 
cushion, too little leg room, or simply the general sense that their time in the air was not attended to with the kind of 
red-carpet treatment they felt they deserved.Ryanair made a virtue of not caring about such quibbles. Led by their 
incorrigible CEO Michael O'Leary, the airline traded on their rough-and-ready image, confident that their core 
qualities of providing reliable, on-time, cheap flights to and from multiple destinations across Europe would make 
them the continent's dominant airline.It turned out that the vast majority of flyers didn't really care about being 
pampered. What really mattered was that Ryanair got you from A to B cheaply, on time and perhaps most crucially 
of all, on flights that were not going to be cancelled.How things have changed. 
Now, travelers across Europe are wary of booking Ryanair flights for the very opposite reasons for which they used 
to book in their droves.The Irish airline has been beset by strikes this summer, particularly unwelcome given the 
damage a cancelation crisis late last year had already done to the low-cost carrier. This Friday (September 28), 
another big strike takes place, with Ryanair canceling some 150 flights due to cabin crew strikes in Belgium, 
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.Cancelations, increased air fares and delayed flights: the 
airline has had to adjust quickly to a whole new lexicon while passengers have had to adjust to a new reality.Some 
Ryanair staff calling for local employment lawsThe latest strike action is the second pan-European action to have hit 
the company this summer, with similar action having taken place back in July.While the latest wave of cancelations 
(affecting around 30,000 passengers) are primarily caused by cabin crew strikes in the aforementioned countries, 
some German-based Ryanair pilots from the Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) trade union will also take part. In total, 
around 10 percent of Ryanair's German flights will be affected while around 6 percent of Ryanair's some 2,400 
continent-wide flights are affected.After issues over rostering and working conditions caused mass flight 
cancelations this time last year, Ryanair decided to recognize staff unions for the first time.Read more: Up in the 
air? Ryanair's growing painsSince then, tensions and disagreements with some pilots and cabin crew in various 
countries have manifested into a scenario practically all airlines become accustomed to at some stage — the ebb 
and flow of negotiations, strike action, negotiations, strike action.The issues are not so straightforward that a simple 
pay rise solves them. Arguably of most significance is the desire of some Ryanair staff across Europe to be 
answerable to local employment laws, rather than the employment law of Ireland, where the airline is based.For 
example, Ryanair has just struck a three-year deal with cabin crew unions in Italy, with a central plank of the 
agreement being the fact that staff based there can now get local contracts with associated benefits and 
Ryanair seeks soft landing as strikes continue
rights.Ryanair has long held to the practice of initially employing staff on external contracts, before updating them to 
Ryanair contracts, based on Irish industrial law. While the airline's pay structures and wages are far from the best in 
Europe — and pay increases are part of many of the current demands — the grievances leading to most of the 
ongoing strike action across the continent are concerned with issues similar to those resolved in Italy.More than 
meets the eye to these strikes?Ryanair is in continuing negotiations with pilots and cabin crew in several countries, 
but those negotiations have been complicated by the fact that their staff are represented by various trade unions, 
and many by none at all.The airline has consistently pointed out that the trade unions involved have exaggerated 
the level of damage the strike action has done to the airline's schedules and when one looks at the relatively small 
amount of Ryanair flights that have been cancelled in relation to the amount that they fly each day — usually 
around 5 to 8 percent of their flights — that claim appears to hold true.Ryanair have consistently been able to 
maintain the vast majority of their schedules due to the fact that their staff are not gathered under any single 
industrial umbrella — the majority of the carrier's employees have continued to show for work when strike action 
has been called in the various countries.Indeed, Ryanair has regularly complained that much of the strike action is 
driven by trade unions with connections to rival airlines. For example, the VC pilots union — a familiar Ryanair foe 
— is consistently labelled by Ryanair as a Lufthansa union.The airline has now formally complained to the 
European Commission over what it says is the interference of competitors' crew, unions and lobby groups in 
Ryanair's ongoing negotiations with its staff.Earlier this week, Ryanair published details of what it had already 
offered to its pilots and cabin crews across Europe. It did this, it said, "in order to set the record straight, correct 
competitor trade union propaganda and pave the way to a speedy conclusion of collective labor agreements (CLAs) 
with its people and their unions."The trade unions at loggerheads with Ryanair say negotiations are not making 
progress and rejected the airline's claims."It is impertinent to give the impression that Ryanair personnel is 
externally controlled," said VC representative Ingolf Schumacher. "This is another example of the distorted view of 
the despotically acting boss. The VC strike demands have been decided on by elected Ryanair pilots who know 
exactly what the needs of Ryanair cockpit personnel are."Up in the airAs ever in such negotiations, finding a clear 
source of blame is not easy but ultimately it is customers who are losing out.Although Ryanair are managing to 
maintain schedules, the uncertainty that the industrial action has created has clearly started to affect bookings, 
something its chief operating officer admitted earlier this summer."In the past, Ryanair was always the first place I 
checked for flights and I would never have hesitated to book them if the price was right," PJ Egan, a 30-year-old 
who regularly flies around Europe from Ireland, told DW."But recently for a trip to England I specifically booked a 
different airline because I was concerned about Ryanair cancelations. And at the moment I am holding off on 
booking a trip to Germany because there seems to be constant news about Ryanair strikes over there."Regardless 
of the outcome of the blame game, Ryanair knows it ultimately needs to secure more agreements such as the one it 
recently secured in Italy, if it is to keep such sentiments at bay.

Sep 27, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
American Airlines Group Inc. AAL[1] and Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL[2] joined United Continental Holdings, Inc. 
UAL[3] and JetBlue Airways Corporation JBLU[4] in increasing fees for checked bags. Apart from the update on 
baggage fees, Delta was also in news due to a computer glitch, which affected its domestic operations on Sep 25. 
The problem has now been resolved.Meanwhile, the labor unrest at low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[5] 
intensified as pilots in Germany expressed their intention to join the Sep 28 strike across several European nations. 
The imminent strike prompted Ryanair to cancel approximately 150 flights of the scheduled 2,400, affecting multiple 
customers.On the price front, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declined 1.7% over the past week as oil prices 
escalated.(Read the lastAirline Stock Roundup for Sep 19, 2018[6])Recap of the Past Week's Most Important 
Stories 1. In a bid to counter the challenges posed by escalating fuel costs, Delta hiked its first checked bag fee to 
$30 from the previous $25, and the second checked bag fee to $40 from $35 initially on domestic routes. Earlier in 
April, the carrier started charging$60[7]for the first checked bag from basic-economy class passengers travelling to 
and from Europe.Although the hour-long computer glitch at Delta has been resolved, the carrier's record with 
respect to such disruptions has been disappointing. The company had encountered similar issues in 2017 and 2016 
as well. In fact, technical glitches have been massive impediments for companies in the airline space. Since airlines 
spend a lot on technological infrastructure, their profitability might be hurt in the event of any such 
malfunctions.Delta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here[8].2. American Airlines raised its checked bag fee by $5 each for both the first and the second 
bags. Per the renewed fee structure, passengers will have to pay $30 for the first checked bag fee and $40 for the 
second. The revamped fee policy is applicable ondomestic routes, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and the 
Caribbean[9]with immediate effect. However, certain privileged members will continue to enjoy free baggage 
checking (read more: American Airlines Now Jumps on the Bag Fee Hike Bandwagon[10]).3. In a bid to expand 
further, Spirit Airlines, Inc. SAVE[11] has decided to operate nonstop flights connecting Jacksonville International 
Airport to Chicago O'Hare International Airport and Detroit Metro Airport. The new flights will start operating from 
Dec 20, 2018. Once operational, Jacksonville will become the 69th destination for this Miramar, FL-based ultra low-
cost carrier (read more: Spirit Airlines to Strengthen its Base in Florida[12]).4. Ryanair is expected to face another 
strike by cabin crew across Spain, Belgium, Holland, Portugal, Italy and Germany. In this regard, the unions 
representing the respective countries' cabin crew have sent a joint letter to the company, threatening to start the 
largest ever protest at month-end in case it does not improve work environment. Per the company's chief marketing 
officer Kenny Jacobs, these back-to-back strikes, especially at a time of soaring crude oil prices, are hampering

Ryanair's business and resulting in soft bookings (read more: Ryanair Cancels Flights as Cabin Crew Strike Date 
Approaches[13]).5. The U.S. Congress withdrew its plans to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration to 
regulate airlines' current fee structure pertaining to baggage and ticket change prices. However, it has included[14] 
certain rules promoting passengers' interest. Some directives include setting a specific dimension for passenger 
seats with sufficient legroom and width as well as forbidding airlines from offloading passengers from flights after 
clearing the boarding gate.Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline 
players over the last week and during the past six months.The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in 
the red over the last week, leading to decline in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index. Shares of Alaska Airlines Group, 
Inc. ALK[15] decreased the most during the period. Over the course of six months, the sector tracker declined 6.5% 
on multiple headwinds due to high fuel costs. Shares of Latin American carriers, Copa Holdings and GOL Linhas,

Sep 27, 2018( Action Economics Alerts: http://www.actioneconomics.com/info.php#Alerts Delivered by Newstex)  
Brexit: Moody's warns a no-deal scenario could be "significantly credit negative" for airlines, including British 
Airways, Easyjet, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic, along with travel companies TUI and Thomas Cook. 
The agency warned of five main risks that a no-deal Brexit would bring, including loss of traffic rights between the 
UK and the EU in the event of no deal (the UK government itself warned about this last week). International Airlines 
Group, which owns British Airways, said it was "confident" that a deal would be reached on aviation with the EU. 
There has been a lot of scare stories about the risks of a cliff-edge, no-deal Brexit, and most political pundits, and 
ourselves, believe it won't happen given the lose-lose stakes, though a Reuters poll earlier in the month found a 
median forecast on the probability of the UK leaving the EU without a deal at 25%. The EU has offered wriggle 
room, pledging that so long as a divorce agreement can be agreed (final financial arrangement, citizen rights and a 
backstop guarantee for the Irish border), it would be willing to deal with the specifics of a trade deal during a two-
year transition period post Brexit. The principal sticking point remains the Irish border issue.

Sep 26, 2018( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair says it has 
cancelled 190, or about 8% of its 2,400 scheduled flights this Friday. The airline has adjusted its schedule in the 
face of strike action being taken by unions in Spain, Belgium, Holland, Portugal, Italy and Germany.The Irish airline 
says this will affect 30,000 passengers, who have been notified by text and email.The long-running industrial action 
by Ryanair staff[1] centres on working conditions.Ryanair says it 'sincerely regrets these unnecessary customer 
disruptions', which it blames on agitation from competitor airlines.Workers based in countries other than Ireland are 
unhappy that Ryanair has been employing them under Irish legislation.Staff claim this creates significant insecurity 
for them, blocking their access to state benefits in their home country.Employees say they are compelled to receive 
their pay in Irish bank accounts, which affects their credit rating in their home country. 
Any queries they have must be made to an Irish number, which is more expensive than a local call.Ryanair said it 
has agreed to move to local contracts, law and taxation as quickly as possible next year, but with certain 
conditions.The company said on Tuesday it had signed deals with three cabin crew unions in Italy to provide 
employment contracts under Italian law.Ryanair said it had made significant progress in recent weeks with union 
negotiations, which include pilot and/or cabin crew agreements in Ireland, UK, Italy and Germany.It added that, in 
the past two weeks, it had written to the pilot unions in Belgium, Holland, Spain, Portugal and Germany inviting

September 28.Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair's chief marketing officer, said the airline apologized for the strikes, "which we 
have done our utmost to avoid, given that we have already offered these unions recognition agreements, Collective 
Labour Agreements, and a move to local contracts/law in 2019.""We hope these unions will see common sense and 
work with us to finalize agreements for the benefit of our pilots and cabin crew over the coming weeks without 
further disrupting our customers or our flights," Jacobs said.The airline said all affected customers had been given 
three days' notice of the cancellations.New contract for Italy crewEarlier Tuesday, Ryanair also announced it had 
signed a new contract with its cabin crew in Italy, which would begin on October 1 and run for three years.Ryanair 
agreed the terms of the contract in mid-September with the FIT CISL, ANPAC and ANPAV unions, and it includes 
an increase in wages under a new compensation structure.But other Italian trade unions that did not participate in 
the negotiations have criticized the contract and called for an emergency meeting with Labour Minister Luigi Di 
Maio.The Irish airline said in July that it planned to have annual passenger growth of 7 percent to reach 139 million 
passengers in the year to March 2019, and another 9 percent growth to 152 million by March 2020.Strikes by 
Ryanair pilots and cabin crew across Europe resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights this summer.law/cmk

RYAAY[1] is expected to face another strike on Friday by cabin crew across Spain, Belgium, Holland, Portugal, Italy 
and Germany.The unions representing the respective countries' cabin crew had pre-decided on the walkout earlier 
in the month. The unions sent a joint letter to the company, threatening to launch the largest ever protest at month-
end in case it does not improve work environment. (Read more: Ryanair Faces Risk of Another Major Strike at 
Month-End[2])The imminent strike prompted Ryanair to cancel approximately 190 flights of the total 2,400, affecting 
around 30,000 customers. 
The passengers to board have been informed in advance regarding the cancellations with a three-day's notice. 
Similar incidents earlier in the year prompted the carrier to call off several flights during the peak summer season, 
lowering average fares in turn.Persistent Labor Agitation Hurting GrowthNotably, the European low-cost carrier has 
been grappling with labor unrest since the time it acknowledged trade unions last December.Per the company's 
chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs, the back-to-back strikes especially at a time of soaring crude oil prices are 
hampering Ryanair's business and resulting in soft bookings. If this continues unabated, the airline might have to 
rethink its capacity growth plan for winter and summer 2019. Earlier in July, the carrier planned annual passenger 
growth of 7% to 139 million in the year to March 2019 and another 9% to 152 million in the year to March 
2020.Amid this pessimism, Ryanair informed about having made a 'significant progress' regarding negotiations with 
labor groups in Ireland, the U.K., Italy and Germany over the past few weeks.The persistent labor agitation has 
taken a toll on Ryanair's shares. The stock has declined 21.8% in the past six months.Zacks Rank ...y PicksRyanair

Rant A Ryanair passenger filmed a baggage handler atManchester Airport[1]throw passengers' luggageonto a 
conveyor cart with seemingly no regard for the contents inside. In the footage, a total of five bags are thrown onto 
the ground before the baggage claim worker moves away from the conveyor line. This short video set led to public 
statements from Manchester Airport, Ryanair,[2] and the third-party baggage claim handler, Swissport. "Manchester 
Airport will not tolerate the kinds of behavior shown yesterday by the employees of the ground handling company 
Swissport," Manchester Airport CEO Andrew Cowan said in a statement released on Facebook.[3] A Ryanair 
passenger filmed a baggage handler at Manchester Airport throw passengers' luggage onto a conveyor cart with 
seemingly no regard for the contents inside. 
According to Metro UK,[4] Elizabeth Evans, 28, of Bury, Greater Manchester, England, caught the employee 
throwing multiple suitcases onto a conveyor car after her Ryanair flight landed in Manchester from Malaga on the 
morning of September 20. Evans was preparing to de-board the plane when she began filming the employee as he 
handled the luggage. In a video that is now featured onBBC[5] and on YouTube,[6] Evans can be heard[7] saying, 
"That's mine, yeah," as she watches her own pink suitcase be thrown by the baggage claim worker, eventually 
sliding off the cart and onto the ground. In the footage, a total of five bags are thrown on the ground before the 
baggage claim worker moves away from the conveyor line. This short video set off a public relations firestorm 
among Manchester Airport, Ryanair, and the third-party baggage claim handler. In response to one Twitter user's 
complaint, Manchester Airport's Twitter feed[8] issued a statement stating that the airport itself doesn't handle 
baggage, but that "each airline employs their own baggage handler," and the handler employed by Ryanair, in this 
case, 
was 
the 
company 
"Swissport."Tweet

//twitter.com/mims/statuses/1042824479255261184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Hi Ryan, we're aware of this video and 
are disappointed to have seen this unacceptable baggage handling. This has been raised with Swissport, the 
baggage handler in question, directly. Baggage is not handled by Manchester Airport, each airline employs their 
own baggage handler. Manchester Airport CEO Andrew Cowan then released a more forceful statement on the 
airport's Facebook[9] page that said: "Manchester Airport will not tolerate the kinds of behavior shown yesterday by 
the employees of the ground handling company Swissport. We are clear that it is completely unacceptable for our 
customer's belongings to be treated in this way by any company operating on our site." Swissport is an international 
third-party airport service company, whose website[10] claims they have served 132 million customers in the first 
half of 2018. Their listed business activities include ground handling, cargo services, fuelling, and aviation security.

In a statement to Business Insider, a Swissport spokesperson said, "We are disappointed by the video footage 
circulating on social media. We apologise for the behavior of this individual, which is unacceptable and will not be 
tolerated. Swissport employees are well-trained in baggage handling and we will use this incident to remind all staff 
of our duty of care with passengers' belongings." The statement went on to add that Swissport is conducting a full 
investigation into the matter and that the company views the employee's behavior as "an isolated incident." In their 
statement to Business Insider, a Ryanair spokesperson said, "We've asked our handling agent,Swissport, to take 
the necessary steps to ensure this does not recur." The full footage can be seen in the video below.Youtube

From November, Ryanair customers with non-priority seats will only be able to take one "small personal bag" on 
board and pay an extra €8 ($9.4) for to bring another carry-on bag. Italy's competition watchdog, Antitrust, is 
investigating the budget airline over this controversial charge. Antitrust argued that carry-on baggage is an 
"essential element of transport." 
It said the baggage charge should be included in the ticket price, as it would distort the final price of the ticket 
otherwise. Italy's competition watchdog is investigating Ryanair for potentially distorting the airline market by 
charging for carry-on baggage. Antitrust, Italy's competition authority, said carry-on baggage was an "essential 
element of transport" that should be factored into the ticket price, Agence France-Presse reported[1]. Ryanair 
announced earlier this year that[2] from November, customers with non-priority seats — the cheapest fare — will 
only be able to take a "small personal bag" that fits under their seats, like a handbag or laptop case. Customers will 
have to pay €8 ($9.4) to carry an extra bag of up to 10 kg (22 lb), the new rules say. Antitrust said that the policy 
was an unfair commercial practice as it distorts the final price of the ticket, which means customers cannot properly 
compare Ryanair's prices with those of other airlines.Consumer associations had complained to Antitrust about 
Ryanair's baggage charge decision, Agence France-Presse reported. Codacons, an Italian consumer rights 
association, said in a statement[3] that "if its unfair commercial practice on hand luggage is confirmed, Ryanair 
should reimburse all its customers who suffer unfair additional costs." Codacons also pledged to take the matter to 
court if necessary. Ryanair justified its decision to charge for carry-on baggage last year, saying that passengers 
were bringing on board too much luggage to make it sustainable[4]. The new policy, Ryanair said, is intended to 
reduce the number of customers flying with two carry-on bags, a development that was "causing flight delays due to 
large numbers of gate bag and cabin bag offloads."NOW WATCH: There are a set of wheels the let you drive side

Airlines Attempt to Offset Rising Costs Via Baggage Fee Hike
Airlines Attempt to Offset Rising Costs Via Baggage Fee Hike

Sep 20, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In a bid to counter the 
challenges posed by escalating costs, airlines are on a spree to raise fees for checked bags. Delta Air Lines, Inc. 
DAL[1] is the latest carrier to have joined the bandwagon, following similar moves by other industry participants, 
namely JetBlue Airways Corporation JBLU[2] and United Continental Holdings, Inc. UAL[3] late in August.Delta has 
hiked its first checked bag fee to $30 from the previous $25 and the second checked bag fee to $40 from $35 
earlier on domestic routes. 
Earlier in April, the carrier started charging $60[4] for the first checked bag from basic-economy class passengers 
travelling to and from Europe.United Continental and JetBlue too follow the same fee structure for domestic 
services except that the latter also levied an increase in fees to change tickets. JetBlue now charges $200[5] for 
changing or canceling a ticket valued at more than $200. Earlier it used to charge $150 for the same. However, 
passengers belonging to the highest fare class category are exempted from the renewed fee structure. The low-
cost carrier's fee policy for changing nonrefundable tickets on domestic routes matches that of the likes of American 
Airlines Group Inc. AAL[6], Delta and United Continental.While Delta generated nearly $908[7] million in baggage 
fees last year (thrice the 2008 figure), the U.S. airline industry's revenues from baggage and reservation change 
fees jumped to $7.5[8] billion in 2017 from $5.7 billion in 2010.Following the footsteps of JetBlue, the first to make 
the fee-hike move, Canadian carriers like Air Canada and WestJet Airlines, too increased charges for bag 
checking.Rising Fuel Prices Behind the TrendThe prime reason behind this strategic move by airlines can be 
attributed to escalating fuel prices. Oil prices have risen roughly 20% year over year. Since fuel expenses are 
significant for airlines, an increase in oil prices is detrimental to the health of the industry. Apart from fuel expenses, 
high labor costs are a drag on the sector participants. Of late, airlines have been engaging in frequent labor deals 
with pilots and crew members, giving in to their demands for a better pay structure among other benefits. In this 
regard, it is worth mentioning the recent struggles of the European carrier Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[9] 
pertaining to a fair deal with its pilots and cabin crew. (Read more: Ryanair Faces Risk of Another Major Strike at 
Month-End[10])US Congress Intervention in Baggage Fee HikesAmid several U.S. carriers raising baggage fees 
successively, the Congress is debating[11] on whether the airline baggage and ticket change prices are 'reasonable 
and proportional to the costs incurred by the air carrier.' If the existing fee structure is found unreasonable, the 
Congress will pass a provision that will reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration to regulate the airlines' 
current fee structure. The U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate have been holding sessions on getting a 
compromise bill passed by Sep 30.Dismal Price PerformanceThe Zacks Airline Industry[12] has declined 13.9% in 
the past six months against the broader Transportation sector[13]'s 3.2% growth. This underperformance can be 
Airlines Attempt to Offset Rising Costs Via Baggage Fee Hike
linked to the industry's persistent battle due to rising operating expenses, mainly fuel.Will American Airlines Follow 
Suit?The immediate focus is now on whether American Airlines walks the path of its rivals in hiking baggage fees. 
Meanwhile, low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co. LUV[14] exempts fee for two checked bags and executives 
further confirm the carrier's intention not to change the same for the time being.Other low-cost carriers like Spirit 
Airlines, Inc. SAVE[15] and Allegiant Travel Company already charge $30 for the first checked bag on some routes. 
These airlines have separate bag fees on different routes.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric 
Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the 
world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas 
guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging 
stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one

Sep 13, 2018( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  CNBC published an article last 
week asking 'Is there anything left to charge passengers for?[1]' When I spoke with the author for the article, I 
explained my view: nearly all of what's palatable to pull out of the fare has already been pulled out. That's especially 
true for ultra low cost carriers. This means the future of ancillary revenue growth lies in either squeezing more out of 
existing fees through optimization or finding new products to sell. 
It's the latter that I want to talk about today with what seems like an odd strategy. Some airlines have begun to sell 
tickets for travel on other airlines as an  la carte opportunity.Ryanair and easyJet have been at the forefront of this 
strategy, though others appear to be following. The idea is that Ryanair and easyJet have so many people visiting 
their websites that they can provide a huge increase in distribution to smaller airlines. While many smaller airlines 
might turn to Kayak, Google Flights, or Expedia to sell tickets and gain visibility, they can now also turn to bigger 
airlines to try to achieve similar results.I prefer to look at Ryanair over easyJet since the former's strategy seems to 
be more focused on this effort. easyJet has done more with building connections to its own flights, though it has 
grown its 'Partner Direct[2]' offering which allows bookings for flights on Loganair, Corsair, Neos, and La 
Compagnie. Still, Ryanair seems more ambitious.In May 2017, I wrote about Ryanair dipping its toes into 
connections and interlining[3]. At the time, I said this:Ryanair just started selling Air Europa flights from Madrid to 
South America on its website. This may seem odd since it doesn't involve connections or Ryanair flights at all. But 
that's because this is again a test. Later this year, you'll be able to buy connections from Ryanair flights on to these 
long-haul Air Europa flights at Ryanair.com. Other airlines will follow. With such a large network of options, even 
tiny numbers can add up quickly and provide a benefit to the Ryanair network.Thinking about that further, I'm pretty 
sure I missed the mark completely. Sure, Ryanair would like to eventually get connections if the fare is high enough 
to make sense, but this isn't just a test. Ryanair likes selling other airline tickets, because it can make money.Look 
at the first partner, Air Europa. Though it is a member of SkyTeam, Air Europa is more of a regional player in Spain 
with limited distribution. Ryanair starts selling flights and all of a sudden, or so the story goes, Air Europa has 
increased its reach and appeal.Just last month, Ryanair signed a deal with Air Malta[4] to do the same thing: sell 
tickets on Air Malta without connections to Ryanair. The press release clearly shows what Ryanair is up to in this 
quote from CCO David O'Brien:We are pleased to announce this exciting partnership with Air Malta, which allows 
our 139m customers to browse and book flights on 21 new routes from Malta to exciting cities in Austria, Czechia, 
Israel, Morocco, Russia, Switzerland, Tunisia and Ukraine, in addition to over 300 existing destinations available on 
the Ryanair.com website, the world's largest travel website, which receives over 50m unique visitors every 
month.This partnership is the latest [Always Getting Better program] enhancement as we continue our journey to 
Next Airline Fee Opportunity: Selling Tickets on Other Airlines
becoming the 'Amazon of travel.'The '139m customers' figured is mentioned more than once. Ryanair has the heft, 
and it wants to use that to make more money. How is it going to do that? Well, let's start with an example. This 
option is on Air Malta's website to go from Malta to Cagliari on December 2:And here's what Ryanar is selling on 
that exact same flight:There is no surcharge here for travelers who book through Ryanair. Sure, the fare options are 
more limited than what you'll find on the Air Malta site, but the cheapest fare is offered. Undoubtedly Air Malta is 
going to have to pay Ryanair a nice chunk of change to get the benefit of exposure. Presumably this is a fee-per-
booking arrangement, but I suppose it could be a different model that pays based on the number of impressions. At 
the same time, Ryanair can help expand its customer base by trying to become a true travel website with broader 
appeal. The moves feed each other and fill Ryanair's coffers.This isn't a uniquely-European strategy, however. I 
decided to revisit another head-scratcher: the Frontier and Volaris codeshare. This may be the same kind of thing, 
though it's a far worse implementation.I was thoroughly confused by the codeshare announcement[5] since putting 
two ultra low cost carriers together will rarely result in a lot of viable connections, even fewer if you require them to 
work in both directions. But let's think about this the way Ryanair might.Volaris is an airline that has expanded 
rapidly into the US, and it isn't stopping. In November, for example, the airline opens up Albuquerque with flights to 
Guadalajara. It needs to fill those airplanes, yet it only tangentially participates in global distribution systems. (It 
does, however, sell on Expedia.) So how can it get more reach? It can turn to Frontier, an airline with a common 
ownership group.Let's be clear. Frontier is no Ryanair, but it's an airline that should help Volaris improve its reach 
into travelers in the US. How much, I don't know, but that strategy sounds far more feasible than the idea that a 
codeshare is really helping to boost connections between the two networks. (I hope I'm right on this, because the 
latter strategy still makes no sense.)There's probably a fair bit of money to be made here as well, even if a lot of 
tickets aren't sold. Take a look at the difference in fares to fly one way from Albuquerque to Guadalajara on 
December 3. Here's what Volaris is selling on its own website:And here's what Frontier is selling it for:In case you're 
wondering, the Volaris ticket includes 10kg of carry-on and a seat assignment. I have no idea if the Frontier one 
includes that, because the website doesn't say. But that doesn't matter. You'll pay $50 more for, at best, the same 
product if you book a Volaris flight on the Frontier website.In Ryanair's case, it wants to be like Amazon and have 
the best prices available for everything. In the case of Frontier, it looks like a money grab that's meant to take 
advantage of people who don't think to check directly with Volaris or on another third party site where it's offered for 
less. I don't like that as a long-term strategy. It feels more like a transactional money grab than anything strategic, 
but it may very well still add to the bottom line for Frontier. That's very different from Ryanair's vision.Ryanair isn't 
likely to be selling tickets on the biggest European airlines any time soon, but it shouldn't have much trouble adding 
some of the smaller players who are looking to reach more people. This is good for Ryanair and it's generally good 
for travelers to have easier access to more options they might not know about otherwise. [ 1]:

Sep 12, 2018( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair 
passengers are suffering travel disruptions as German pilots and cabin crew have launched a 24-hour strike over 
better pay and conditions. The Irish low-cost carrier also faces an autumn of discontent elsewhere.The one-day 
strike by Ryanair pilots and cabin crew in Germany began at 3 a.m. (0100 UTC) on Wednesday and grounded 150 
flights out of 400 scheduled to depart from or land at the budget carrier's 19 bases in this country.German pilots' 
union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) said shortly after the walk-out was launched that all major Ryanair bases, including 
Frankfurt/Hahn, Cologne/Bonn and Berlin's two airports Schönefeld and Tegel, had been affected and that 
"participation is good."VC Vice-Chairman Markus Wahl said he expected the strike to become a success, and 
would force Ryanair back to the negotiating table. "This [strike] shows how precarious the situation at Ryanair has 
obviously become," he added.Read more: Opinion: Our addiction to cheap flights is leaving us pennilessBy mid-
morning it wasn't clear, however, how many German pilots and cabin crew would actually walk off their jobs 
throughout the day. 
But it prompted the budget airline to threaten workers with job cuts in Germany if they continued industrial action, 
which it described as a "wildcat strike."Ryanair's chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs told a news conference in 
Frankfurt on Tuesday: "We are not making a threat. But if you have ongoing strikes, that's the economic 
impact."The carrier suffered its worst ever strikes this summer, but secured a breakthrough in August when it 
reached deals with pilots unions in Italy and Ireland.Pay and conditionsRyanair pilots and cabin crew in Germany 
are striking because they earn less than their counterparts at rival airlines. Another complaint is that Ryanair 
employs them under Irish legislation although they are based in countries other than Ireland. This would create 
contractual insecurity and has blocked them from access to state benefits in their country, the union said.The Irish 
carrier has also come under fire, especially in Germany, for its practice of employing some pilots via third-party 
agencies, such as McGinley Aviation, which offer far worse conditions and pay.Read more: Being a pilot isn't what it 
used to beRyanair claims, however, that it has already offered significant pay increases and steadier contracts, 
allowing pilots to make "up to €190,000 ($220,000) a year."VC has countered the claim by saying that this applies 
to only "a handful" of pilots, and that basic starting salary at the airline was closer to €39,000 euros a year. Only the 
most experienced can earn around €110,000 and more depending on flight hours.Read more: Higher fuel costs, 
pilot pay shrink Ryanair profitDuring the labor dispute in Germany, VC has called on Ryanair to agree to mediation 
over pay and terms, but there has been disagreement over who the mediator should be.Ryanair cabin crews, 
represented by Germany's white-collar union Verdi, are also fighting for a substantial pay increase. Their basic 
gross salary ranges between €800 and €1,200 a month, Verdi says, well below that of rivals such easyJet. "The 
wages are so low that they are insufficient to ensure a decent living standard," Verdi board member Christine Behle 
Ryanair faces turbulences as strike actions hit
said.Autumn of discontentLast year, Ryanair decided to recognize unions in an attempt to improve relations with its 
pilots and ease a staffing crunch. It has been clashing with worker representatives ever since, resulting in the first-
ever simultaneous walkout in five European countries.The stoppages caused some 400 flight cancellations and 
travel chaos for 55,000 passengers. But Ryanair has also made some progress in clinching collective labor 
agreements, appeasing Italian pilots in August with better pay and conditions in what's become the airline's first-
ever union agreement.Irish pilots also accepted an improved pay deal last week. The breakthrough prompted 
Ryanair to back down from an earlier threat that it would move several aircraft and 300 jobs from Ireland to 
Poland.But disputes with Ryanair cabin crews in Italy, Portugal, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands are still waiting 
to be resolved. Unions in these countries have warned the airline should be bracing for a mass coordinated walkout 
in September.Union leaders are expected to announce details of "the biggest strike action the company has ever 
seen" in Brussels on Thursday.uhe/jh (Reuters, AFP, dpa)

Ryanair strike is the latest industrial action in a summer with successive walkouts in Ireland, Germany, the

Sep 10, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per Reuters[1], Ryanair 
Holdings plc's RYAAY[2] cabin crew across five different countries have warned of a possible strike late in 
September, if the airline fails toprovide better working conditions.Following this news, shares of the company closed 
2.6% down on Sep 7.Last Friday, unions representing cabin crew in Italy, Portugal, Belgium, Spain and the 
Netherlandssent a joint letter to the company, threatening to launch the largest ever protest in case it does not 
improve work environment. The unions are expected to stage a walkout by September-end, for which, a decision 
will be taken by Sep 13. Pilots and ground staff across Europe will be asked to join the protest march besides the 
Irish union also consisting of pilots.The cabin crew is primarily protesting against the airline's usage of a common 
Irish law[3] (except for U.K.-based employees) for all its employees regardless of the country they are based in. The 
employees want a contract governed by the local law.Ryanair Holdings PLC Price           
https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/fundamental/priceRyanair Holdings PLC Price[4] | Ryanair Holdings 
PLC Quote[5]Although this seems to be a modest claim by the unions, Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary is 
of the idea that the common Irish Law is crucial for the carrier's low-cost model and its ability to conveniently 
transfer employees from one place to another as and when needed.The carrier fears that imposition of local 
contracts might adversely impact costs and productivity of the business and thus trigger complexities.However, 
Ryanair's board and management are ready to recognize unions and address issues concerning their staff, 
provided its operational model is not affected in the process, i.e, it is able to offer low fare tickets to its customers 
and stick to its low cost model.On this front, it is to be noted that Ryanair recently dissolved plans to cut down its 
Dublin fleet by six aircraft. 
The event followed after pilots in the region unanimously voted in favor of a deal backed by their trade union. This 
dispelled the risk of more than 100 pilots and cabin crew losing their jobs.Zacks Rank ...y PicksRyanair carries a 
Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector[6] are SkyWest, Inc 
SKYW[7], C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. CHRW[8] and Trinity Industries, Inc. TRN[9]. While C.H. Robinson holds

Sep 05, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[1] posted impressive August traffic numbers despite numerous flight cancellations due to ATC staff 
shortages and labor-unrest. Traffic in the month (including that from its LaudaMotion unit), rose 9% year over year 
to 13.8 million, while load factor remained fixed at 97% primarily owing to cheap air fares. The company's 
Laudamotion unit in Austria recorded a traffic of 0.5 million customers. 
However, excluding traffic from LaudaMotion unit, the European low-cost carrier's passenger growth was only 5% in 
the month.The carrier faced a major strike on Aug 10, when pilots across five of its European destinations walked 
out on failure to come to conclusive agreements with the unions. The labor-conflict coupled with ATC staff 
shortages in the UK, Germany and France caused approximately 550 flight cancellations in August, thereby 
affecting more than 100,000 passengers. In August 2017, there were only 27 flight cancellations.To put an end to

Sep 05, 2018( IT Pro: http://www.itpro.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  Amazon has become the second US company 
to be valued by Wall Street at $1 trillion, just a month after tech rival Apple. Company's stocks rose to $2,050 a 
share on Tuesday, briefly pushing the tech giant above the trillion dollar mark. 
When it went public in 1997, it offered $18 a share. Amazon began life in Seattle in 1994 and in that time, CEO Jeff 
Bezos has become the world's richest man. Initially, It sold books and CDs online but has since grown into a 
technology giant with e-commerce, entertainment and cloud computing departments, the last of which being AWS, 
where it makes large revenues. The company now hosts big name websites such as Netflix and Airbnb and is 
currently leading the race to a 10 billion contract to provide cloud services to the US Department of Defense. In 
July,AWS reportedly raked in $6.1 billionfor the online retail giant in its 2018 second quarter financial results. Part of 
the reason for its high revenues is the ongoing trend of digital transformation running through companies. Its 
second-quarter results were due to big contracts with Ryanair, Major League Baseball, 21st Century Fox and Epic 
Games.AWS is currently the leader in the public cloud, with Microsoft's Azure cloud platform and Google Cloud in 
second and third place respectively, but the company as a whole is second to another tech giant in the race to $1 
trillion. Only a month ago, it was reported that Apple had become the world's first trillion-dollar company after 
soaring share prices pushed the phone manufacturer past the landmark valuation. The Cupertino company pulled in 
profits of $11.5 billion over three months after recording record sales that hit $53.3 billion. Apple's shares jumped, 
pushing the value of the company up from $935 billion towards $1 trillion.

Aug 27, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per Reuters[1], Ryanair 
Holdings PLC RYAAY[2] has finally given in to the Irish pilots' demand, reaching an agreement with the pilots' union 
(Fórsa) on Aug 23, following a 22-hour discussion. Post the event, shares of the company have been flying high 
and closed Friday's trading session at $99.62, up 1.5%.Ryanair has been grappling with labor unrest since the past 
few months. The issue caused several flight cancellations during the peak summer season, affecting average fares 
in turn. 
Notably, the low-cost carrier's average fares declined 4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.Earlier in the month, the 
carrier witnessed a worst of its kind strike, staging a walk-out by pilots across five European countries. This, at last 
prompted Ryanair to indulge in fresh discussions regarding the issue, which ended with the parties entering into a 
labor contract. Similar walk-outs earlier this summer however, failed to fetch results.Ryanair is said to have been 
the worst hit by protests carried out by pilots in its home country, Ireland.The proposed agreement will now be voted 
upon by the Dublin-based pilots of the European carrier. What is encouraging is that the union has recommended 
acceptance of the deal.We note that labor unrest has taken a huge toll on Ryanair, causing its shares to shed 
17.5% value over the past three months. This labor deal, on materialization, is expected to provide a much-needed 
respite to the carrier.Zacks Rank ...y PicksRyanair holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the 
broader Transportation sector[3] are GATX Corporation GATX[4], Trinity Industries, Inc. TRN[5] and SkyWest, Inc 
SKYW[6]. While GATX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Trinity and SkyWest sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Aug 16, 2018( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  As A-level results have 
been announced today with many looking at university next a list of the UK young entrepreneurs with the highest 
net worth estimates, who didn't go to university has been revealed At the top of the list is entrepreneur Alex Lovn, 
who has a net worth of 55 million at just 30 years old. Some of the most famous names on the list include YouTube 
mega-stars Alfie Deyes and Zoe Sugg (aka Zoella), MC Michael Omari (AKA Stormzy) and The Only Way Is Essex 
star Tommy Mallet.Informi has compiled this list as a source of inspiration for those receiving their A-Level or GCSE 
results this month.Steven Drew, Informi spokesperson, said, 'We compiled this list of successful entrepreneurs to 
show how financial success is not dependent on going to university. If you have a passion and hit upon the right 
business idea, you can succeed as these entrepreneurs have.' Alex Lovn (30), Net World Sports Net worth: 55 
million[1]Alex Lovn (pictured) set up his sports retail company, Net World Sports, in 2009. The idea came to him 
after he bought a cricket bat online then wrote to the supplier to find out what the wholesale price was. 
He bought several of the bats at the wholesale price, and sold them to friends for a profit. Lovn owns 99% of Net 
World Sports and the company made profits of 5 million on nearly 20 million of sales in 2016-17. The company has 
won multiple business awards. Jack Cator (29), Privax Ltd Net worth: 45 million[2]Cator's business idea began 
when he was 16. Frustrated with his school's computer network blocking gaming and music sites, he decided to use 
a VPN (Virtual Private Network) website to access his favourite sites. Cator felt that the current VPN services 
weren't of the best quality, so he decided to create his own, and Hide My Ass was born. He sold his company 
(Privax Ltd, parent company of Hide My Ass) for 40 million 10 years later and now continues as Chief Executive. 
Akshay Ruparelia (19), Doorsteps.co.uk[3] Net Worth: 16 million[4]In just over a year Ruparelia's firm has already 
been valued at 12 million and he has sold 100 million worth of homes. The 19-year-old is now one of Britain's 
youngest millionaires. Doorsteps.co.uk[5] began when Ruparelia, a young carer, was introduced to the real estate 
world where he felt commission fees were unfair. Hence, after being inspired by Ryanair's founder, he set up his 
own real estate agency which cuts out commission fees and charges just 99 for its services. Despite his success, 
Ruparelia only pays himself 1,000 a month because he says he's 'in it for the long-run'. Jamal Edwards MBE (27), 
SBTV Net worth: 8 million[6]Jamal Edwards starting building what would become media empire SBTV, when he 
was given a camera for his 15th birthday. Edwards began by making amateur music videos just for his friends, but 
his talent means that he has now gone on to work with the likes of Drake and Nicki Minaj. SBTV now has over 1 
million subscribers on YouTube, Edwards has been made an MBE and became a member of the Sunday Times 
Rich List. The author and entrepreneur even counts Sir Richard Branson amongst his friends. He believes that a 
10 UK Young Entrepreneurs with the highest net worth who didn't go to university
business should start with a passion, rather than a desire for money. Zoe Sugg (28), Zoella Net worth: 2.5 
million[7]A YouTube mega-star, Zoella has dipped into several entrepreneurial ventures. She has written books, 
created a beauty and lifestyle range and has a wax figure of herself at Madame Tussauds London. Zoe (or Zoella) 
has shot to stardom through her YouTube presence, posting various lifestyle, beauty or vlogging videos. She has 
amassed over 12 million subscribers and has a strong network of super-fans. Her products have been widely 
successful: her book Girl Online becoming a number one bestselling debut novel and her products being stocked in 
Superdrug stores nationwide. All of this born from 'haul' and 'favourites' videos. Alfie Deyes (24), Pointless Blog Net 
worth: 1.5 million[8]This YouTube mega-star has accumulated over four million followers online and has also got a 
wax model of himself at Madame Tussauds. He launched his channel in 2009 whilst in school and now has an 
online empire. Deyes has a merchandise brand as well as two published books, with plans to continue releasing his 
entrepreneurial endeavours. He rejected going to university (despite having an unconditional offer) to continue his 
passion of making videos. A smart choice, considering his various vlogs reportedly earn him up to 1 million or more 
each year. He and fellow YouTuber Zoe Sugg are engaged, showing prospects for their united 'Zalfie' brand to grow 
even more. Michael Omari (24), Stormzy / #Merky Net worth: 1.5 million[9]This London-raised MC rapper has 
recently announced his partnership with Penguin Publications. Curated by Stormzy, and launching with his first 
book Rise Up in November 2018, #Merky Books will form a home for a new generation of voices. Stormzy wants his 
platform to inspire young writers, explaining that writing is what helped him get to where he is today. Stormzy's 
successes has meant he has won multiple awards and even hosted a Q...anel at Oxford University, despite never 
actually going to university himself. His music business, #Merky Touring has built towards his success but it is likely 
that his new publishing partnership will further boost his career. Tanya Burr (29), Tanya Burr Cosmetics / YouTube 
Net worth: 1.5 million[10]Here, we have another famous YouTuber. After finishing school, Burr took a short course 
in make-up artistry and from these skills created a YouTube channel, posting make-up tutorials. She now has over 
three million subscribers and a cosmetics line sold nationwide in Superdrug stores and on online retailers such as 
Feel Unique. This goes to show how easily a passion can develop into a successful business. Burr advises that 
being active on social media is one of the ways she has achieved business success. Fraser Doherty MBE (29), 
Super Jam Net worth: 1.5 million[11]Doherty began his business when he was just 14 and had a business 
breakthrough at just 18. He became the youngest ever supplier to a major supermarket chain when Waitrose 
launched his range in March 2007. His business, Super Jam, is inspired by recipes from his grandmother and now 
supplies over 2,000 supermarkets around the world. His success has meant that he has won multiple entrepreneur-
related awards and has also published a book sharing his jam-making secrets which has gone on to be a bestseller. 
He has also given hundreds of motivational speeches on his success at universities and conferences around the 
world. Tommy Mallet (25), Mallet Footwear Net worth: 1 million[12]This TOWIE star comes from humble 
beginnings. As a child, he was bullied at school for not having the latest and most fashionable shoes. It is from 
these experiences that he set about beginning his own footwear brand at 15: Mallet Footwear - a designer shoes 
brand that has sold over 150,000 pairs since its launch. The brand started selling shoes online and 2016 footwear 
chain Choice started stocking Mallet's products. Mallet footwear has out-sold big brands such as Michael Kors and 
has several celebrity customers including Drake and Olly Murs. Despite growing up on a council estate and having 
dyslexia, Mallet's business is predicted to make 4 million this year!Steven Drew from informi[13]which carried out 
the research adds: 'University is useful for a number of reasons and for many thousands of people. However, 
success can be found in a manner of different routes as these young entrepreneurs show.'Nowadays the resources 
available for those interested in starting up a business, from online information to training courses and 
qualifications, mean that there is a growing potential for young entrepreneurs to fulfil their dreams and ambitions. 
Any potential entrepreneurs should ensure they look to find what support is available for them and take advantage 
of it. These ten entrepreneurs will have had significant support from a variety of experts in different fields to help 
them get to where they are today.' Read more: 10 UK Young Entrepreneurs with the highest net worth who didn't go

Aug 23, 2018( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Irish no-
frills carrier Ryanair has said it has reached an agreement with the trade union representing its Irish pilots. 
It was good news for the budget airline, which had sought to quell staff protests across Europe.The proposed 
agreement between Ryanair and its Irish-based pilots will now go to a ballot, with a recommendation for acceptance 
from Forsa, the union representing Ryanair's Irish pilots said Thursday.It added that the talks' mediator had asked 
all sides to refrain from comments on the deal while the ballot was being conducted.Thursday's agreement was 
seen as a breakthrough by analysts that sent the carrier's shares up sharply and could provide a blueprint for 
Ryanair's negotiations with pilots elsewhere in Europe.The airline has suffered hundreds of flight cancellations this 
summer because of protests by pilots over slow progress in negotiating collective labor agreements, hurting 
average fares at the budget airline.Feeling the pinchRyanair endured its worst one-day strike earlier in August after 
a walkout by pilots in five European countries, including Germany.The industrial action disrupted the travel plans of 
about 55,000 passengers at the height of the summer holiday season.Ryanair said it would take the proposed 
agreement to its board after the pilots' ballot.Some of the other trade unions stuck in negotiations across the 
Continent said they were watching the Irish talks closely.Ryanair employs more than 4,000 pilots, with around 350 
of them based in Ireland.hg/aos (Reuters, AFP)

Kim Dublin-based airline Ryanair[1] issued an apology after mistakenly sending unsigned compensation checks to 
nearly 200 passengers. These passengers were owed money by the airline for previous flight cancellations and 
delays. Ryanair said in a statement to Business Insider, "We apologise sincerely for this inconvenience which arose 
out of our desire to issue these compensation cheques quickly to our customers." European Union[2] flight 
regulations require compensation paid to passengers if their flights are severely delayed or canceled. 
Ryanair issued an apology after the European airline mistakenly sent unsigned compensation checks to nearly 200 
passengers who were owed money for previous flight cancellations and delays. In a statement to Business Insider, 
Ryanair Head of Communications Robin Kiely said, "Due to an admin error, a tiny number of cheques (less than 
190 out of over 20,000 compensation cheques in July) were posted without a required signatory. These cheques 
were re-issued last week and we apologise sincerely for this inconvenience which arose out of our desire to issue 
these compensation cheques quickly to our customers." Ryanair, who is Europe's largest low-cost carrier,[3] has 
been besieged by cancellations and delays this year. According to the BBC[4],more than one million Ryanair 
passengers in Europe have had their flights delayed or canceled since April, citing the airline's own figures. The 
BBC also reports a pilots' walkout on August 10 led to nearly 400 flights being canceled.The Dublin-based carrier 
had previously been in a union dispute[5] with striking pilots over conditions, base transfers, and annual leave. An 
agreement between the airline and its pilots was struck on Thursday[6] after a 22-hour bargaining session. This 
dysfunction has added up in costs for the airline, as Ryanair is required by law to financially compensate each 
passenger per delay or cancelation. Under European Union regulation 261/2004,[7] airlines are required to 
compensate[8]passengers for up to €600 if their flights are significantly delayed. Passengers are eligible for a full 
refund if the flight is canceled.  The Telegraph reports[9] that a strike by Ryanair pilots in July saw over 30 flights 
canceled, affecting the travel of up to 5,000 passengers. This set of a controversy between Ryanair and its 
passengers when the airline refused to pay compensation checks, citing the European Union legislation absolves 
the airline from paying compensation in the event of a strike. The Telegraph reports[10] the airline told theBBC: 
"Ryanair complies fully with EU261 legislation, under which no compensation is payable to customers when the 
(strike) delay/cancellation is beyond the airline's control. As for the issue of the unsigned checks this month, 
Ryanair told the British consumer association Which?[11] that the checks were reissued on August 15. Some took 
to social media to point out Ryanair's inability to hold up their end of the bargain, mixing gallows humor with basic 
frustration. Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1032164025491247105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw A bounced

Aug 16, 2018( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  As A-level results have 
been announced today with many looking at university next a list of the UK young entrepreneurs with the highest 
net worth estimates, who didn't go to university has been revealed At the top of the list is entrepreneur Alex Lovn, 
who has a net worth of 55 million at just 30 years old. Some of the most famous names on the list include YouTube 
mega-stars Alfie Deyes and Zoe Sugg (aka Zoella), MC Michael Omari (AKA Stormzy) and The Only Way Is Essex 
star Tommy Mallet.Informi has compiled this list as a source of inspiration for those receiving their A-Level or GCSE 
results this month.Steven Drew, Informi spokesperson, said, 'We compiled this list of successful entrepreneurs to 
show how financial success is not dependent on going to university. If you have a passion and hit upon the right 
business idea, you can succeed as these entrepreneurs have.' Alex Lovn (30), Net World Sports Net worth: 55 
million[1]Alex Lovn (pictured) set up his sports retail company, Net World Sports, in 2009. The idea came to him 
after he bought a cricket bat online then wrote to the supplier to find out what the wholesale price was. 
He bought several of the bats at the wholesale price, and sold them to friends for a profit. Lovn owns 99% of Net 
World Sports and the company made profits of 5 million on nearly 20 million of sales in 2016-17. The company has 
won multiple business awards. Jack Cator (29), Privax Ltd Net worth: 45 million[2]Cator's business idea began 
when he was 16. Frustrated with his school's computer network blocking gaming and music sites, he decided to use 
a VPN (Virtual Private Network) website to access his favourite sites. Cator felt that the current VPN services 
weren't of the best quality, so he decided to create his own, and Hide My Ass was born. He sold his company 
(Privax Ltd, parent company of Hide My Ass) for 40 million 10 years later and now continues as Chief Executive. 
Akshay Ruparelia (19), Doorsteps.co.uk[3] Net Worth: 16 million[4]In just over a year Ruparelia's firm has already 
been valued at 12 million and he has sold 100 million worth of homes. The 19-year-old is now one of Britain's 
youngest millionaires. Doorsteps.co.uk[5] began when Ruparelia, a young carer, was introduced to the real estate 
world where he felt commission fees were unfair. Hence, after being inspired by Ryanair's founder, he set up his 
own real estate agency which cuts out commission fees and charges just 99 for its services. Despite his success, 
Ruparelia only pays himself 1,000 a month because he says he's 'in it for the long-run'. Jamal Edwards MBE (27), 
SBTV Net worth: 8 million[6]Jamal Edwards starting building what would become media empire SBTV, when he 
was given a camera for his 15th birthday. Edwards began by making amateur music videos just for his friends, but 
his talent means that he has now gone on to work with the likes of Drake and Nicki Minaj. SBTV now has over 1 
million subscribers on YouTube, Edwards has been made an MBE and became a member of the Sunday Times 
Rich List. The author and entrepreneur even counts Sir Richard Branson amongst his friends. He believes that a 
10 UK Young Entrepreneurs with the highest net worth who didn't go to university
business should start with a passion, rather than a desire for money. Zoe Sugg (28), Zoella Net worth: 2.5 
million[7]A YouTube mega-star, Zoella has dipped into several entrepreneurial ventures. She has written books, 
created a beauty and lifestyle range and has a wax figure of herself at Madame Tussauds London. Zoe (or Zoella) 
has shot to stardom through her YouTube presence, posting various lifestyle, beauty or vlogging videos. She has 
amassed over 12 million subscribers and has a strong network of super-fans. Her products have been widely 
successful: her book Girl Online becoming a number one bestselling debut novel and her products being stocked in 
Superdrug stores nationwide. All of this born from 'haul' and 'favourites' videos. Alfie Deyes (24), Pointless Blog Net 
worth: 1.5 million[8]This YouTube mega-star has accumulated over four million followers online and has also got a 
wax model of himself at Madame Tussauds. He launched his channel in 2009 whilst in school and now has an 
online empire. Deyes has a merchandise brand as well as two published books, with plans to continue releasing his 
entrepreneurial endeavours. He rejected going to university (despite having an unconditional offer) to continue his 
passion of making videos. A smart choice, considering his various vlogs reportedly earn him up to 1 million or more 
each year. He and fellow YouTuber Zoe Sugg are engaged, showing prospects for their united 'Zalfie' brand to grow 
even more. Michael Omari (24), Stormzy / #Merky Net worth: 1.5 million[9]This London-raised MC rapper has 
recently announced his partnership with Penguin Publications. Curated by Stormzy, and launching with his first 
book Rise Up in November 2018, #Merky Books will form a home for a new generation of voices. Stormzy wants his 
platform to inspire young writers, explaining that writing is what helped him get to where he is today. Stormzy's 
successes has meant he has won multiple awards and even hosted a Q...anel at Oxford University, despite never 
actually going to university himself. His music business, #Merky Touring has built towards his success but it is likely 
that his new publishing partnership will further boost his career. Tanya Burr (29), Tanya Burr Cosmetics / YouTube 
Net worth: 1.5 million[10]Here, we have another famous YouTuber. After finishing school, Burr took a short course 
in make-up artistry and from these skills created a YouTube channel, posting make-up tutorials. She now has over 
three million subscribers and a cosmetics line sold nationwide in Superdrug stores and on online retailers such as 
Feel Unique. This goes to show how easily a passion can develop into a successful business. Burr advises that 
being active on social media is one of the ways she has achieved business success. Fraser Doherty MBE (29), 
Super Jam Net worth: 1.5 million[11]Doherty began his business when he was just 14 and had a business 
breakthrough at just 18. He became the youngest ever supplier to a major supermarket chain when Waitrose 
launched his range in March 2007. His business, Super Jam, is inspired by recipes from his grandmother and now 
supplies over 2,000 supermarkets around the world. His success has meant that he has won multiple entrepreneur-
related awards and has also published a book sharing his jam-making secrets which has gone on to be a bestseller. 
He has also given hundreds of motivational speeches on his success at universities and conferences around the 
world. Tommy Mallet (25), Mallet Footwear Net worth: 1 million[12]This TOWIE star comes from humble 
beginnings. As a child, he was bullied at school for not having the latest and most fashionable shoes. It is from 
these experiences that he set about beginning his own footwear brand at 15: Mallet Footwear - a designer shoes 
brand that has sold over 150,000 pairs since its launch. The brand started selling shoes online and 2016 footwear 
chain Choice started stocking Mallet's products. Mallet footwear has out-sold big brands such as Michael Kors and 
has several celebrity customers including Drake and Olly Murs. Despite growing up on a council estate and having 
dyslexia, Mallet's business is predicted to make 4 million this year!Steven Drew from informi[13]which carried out 
the research adds: 'University is useful for a number of reasons and for many thousands of people. However, 
success can be found in a manner of different routes as these young entrepreneurs show.'Nowadays the resources 
available for those interested in starting up a business, from online information to training courses and 
qualifications, mean that there is a growing potential for young entrepreneurs to fulfil their dreams and ambitions. 
Any potential entrepreneurs should ensure they look to find what support is available for them and take advantage 
of it. These ten entrepreneurs will have had significant support from a variety of experts in different fields to help 
them get to where they are today.' 10 UK Young Entrepreneurs with the highest net worth who didn't go to

on Google+ Share on LinkedInAfter Ryanair, Air France KLM is the second company to be facing the prospect of a 
Europe-wide strike. Air France shares slumped by just under 6% on Monday, cumulating to approximately 40% 
since the beginning of the year. 
Pilots are demanding pay rises and the SNPL union threatens with 15 days of strikes amidst peak tourist season. 
Separate talks with the Dutch pilots union VNV are also reportedly in 'a difficult phase,' according to De Telegraf. 
Pilots and cabin crew have not seen a pay rise since 2012. The company has been without a CEO since May when 
the former CEO Philippe Evain failed to reach a compromise with the unions. Media speculate that his favoured 
successor is Benjamin Smith, the deputy head of Air Canada. Smith has a reputation for putting shareholders' 
interests first and is expected to take a combative stand on industrial disputes, according toLe Parisien. Air France-
KLM is mostly owned by the state with Delta Airlines and China Eastern Arilines holding 14% and 8.8% shares 
respectively. Over the first quarter of 2018, the company posted €269 million in losses, up from €33 million during 
the same period last year. Since the 2004 merger with the Dutch KLM carrier, Air France has been unable to return 
to profitability. In May the French prime minister Bruno Le Maire had warned that the future of the company 'hanged 
in the balance,' calling on workers to be 'responsible' and making clear that the government would not be willing to 
cover the company's deficit indefinitely. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn

Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Stock Slips to 52-Week Low on Labor Unrest
Ryanair (RYAAY) Stock Slips to 52-Week Low on Labor Unrest

Aug 13, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Ryanair 
Holdings plc RYAAY[1] tumbled to a 52-week low of $94.50 on Aug 10. However, shares recovered to some extent 
to close the trading session at $96.77, down 2.8% from the closing price of Aug 9.Worst One-Day Strike Throws 
Travel HaywireRyanair has been struggling with labor-related issues for quite some time. The situation took a turn 
for the worse with pilots in five European countries, including Sweden and Belgium, resorting to a 24-hour strike on 
Aug 10The action by the pilots led to multiple flight cancellations hurting travel plans of approximately 55,000 
passengers across Europe. Notably, the labor unrest comes at a most inappropriate time with the summer holiday 
season is at its peak in Europe. The pilots are looking for more transparency with regard to promotions and 
transfers, thus reducing undue management discretion.We remind investors that on Jul 12, Ryanair's pilots, based 
in Ireland, went on a 24-hour strike in protest against management's approach toward transfers between the 
carrier's European and African bases. This strike also resulted in multiple flight cancellations and hampered travel 
plans of many passengers.Other HeadwindsApart from the ongoing labor unrest, other headwinds have been 
hurting Ryanair. The carrier remains concerned about a Brexit-related impact with leisure and business travel 
demand taking a hit. The carrier fears that its UK shareholders will be treated as non-EU. We note that Mar 29, 
2019 is the date for the UK to leave the EU.Moreover, rising fuel costs are anticipated to limit bottom-line growth. 
Ryanair expects its fuel bill to rise by more than €400m in fiscal 2019 (ending Mar 31, 2019). This significant 
increase is expected to be a major drag on the company's earnings.In a year's time, shares of this European low-
cost carrier have underperformed the Zacks Airline industry[2]. The stock has shed 17.4% of its value compared 
with the industry's 10.3% decline.One- Year Price PerformanceOther MetricsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 
fiscal 2019 and 2020 earnings moved south 11.3% and 12.4%, respectively, in the last 60 days. This reflects 
investor's pessimism surrounding the stock. Furthermore, the stock has aVGM Score[3]of C, which highlights its 
unattractiveness. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted 
combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and 
select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while 
arriving at a VGM Score.Undoubtedly, the above negatives substantiate the company's Zacks Rank #5 (Strong 
Sell).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector [4]includeTrinity Industries, 
Inc. TRN[5], CSX Corporation CSX[6] and Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC[7], each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 
(Strong Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[8].Shares of Trinity, CSX and 
Norfolk Southern have rallied more than 31%, 42% and 43%, respectively, in a year.Wall Street's Next 
AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the 
greatest investments of all time. It's a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

Aug 10, 2018( The Today File: https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/ Delivered by Newstex)  BERLIN (AP) — 
Ryanair pilots in several European countries on Friday staged a strike that prompted the budget carrier to cancel 
400 flights. A walkout called by German union Cockpit accounted for many of Friday's cancelations. 
Strikes were also called in Sweden, Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands.The airline said that over 2,000 flights, or 
85 percent of its schedule, would operate as normal and that the majority of passengers affected have been re-
booked on other Ryanair services. German pilot representatives said Wednesday they were joining the strike action 
with a 24-hour walkout, ending at 2.59 a.m. Saturday, because they want pay and work conditions comparable to 
those at Ryanair's competitors. Most Read Business Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1]The 
company calls the strikes 'regrettable and unjustified,' pointing to recent pay increases and invitations to meet for 
negotiations.Ryanair built its low-cost business model without unions, but said last year it would recognize them. 
Labor representatives are seeking collective-bargaining agreements in the different countries. The airline has 
already been hit with strikes by flight attendants in Spain, Portugal and Belgium. Irish pilots have held four strike 
days.In the Netherlands, the carrier was using non-striking pilots to keep its service running for passengers. In a 
tweet Thursday night, the company said that 'there will be no cancellations as a result of the unnecessary strike 
action by the Dutch pilot union.' Ryanair launched unsuccessful legal action in a Dutch court to prevent the strike in 
the Netherlands. In Sweden, some 40 Ryanair pilots walked out to demand a collective labor agreement.Martin 
Lindgren, head of the Swedish Air Line Pilots Association, said that 'a strike is necessary to show the airline that it 
no longer can avoid treating its employees in a dignified manner.'Ryanair called on the unions 'to continue 
negotiations instead of calling any more unjustified strikes.' [ 1]: https://www.seattletimes.com/subscribe/signup-

most severe industrial action in the airline's history.The biggest strike in Ryanair's 33-year history began at 3 a.m. 
(0100 UTC) in Germany as pilots took action in support of their claims for better pay and conditions.The trade union 
Cockpit said 480 Germany-based pilots were not expected to return to work until 2.59 a.m. Saturday."Ryanair alone 
is responsible for the escalation we are now seeing," Cockpit president Martin Locher said, adding that the carrier 
had ruled out higher personnel costs which left no room for compromise.Read more:Opinion: Our addiction to

been cancelled, affecting about 55,000 passengers, 42,000 of them in Germany. Refunds or rerouted journeys 
have been offered to the people concerned. Ryanair claimed more than 2,000 flights would operate as normal on 
Friday.DW reporter Lars Halter at Berlin-Schönefeld airport said the situation was "very calm." As Ryanair had 
already informed passengers of the disruption there was "no one looking desperately for flights."Claims for pay and 
better conditionsRyanair pilots say they earn less than their colleagues in other airlines such as Lufthansa.Other 
concerns are the status of contractors whose working conditions are not as good as those enjoyed by permanently 
employed staff and employee contracts based on Irish legislation. This can mean staff based in other European 
states are unable to gain access to state benefits.Ryanair's management claims to have offered a pay increase and 
to be open to further talks. But it has also threatened to move part of its fleet to Poland, which could mean a loss of 
jobs.The European Trade Union Confederation welcomed the cross-border action by the pilots, saying it made it

Aug 10, 2018( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  The 
Ryanair strike once again focuses attention on working conditions in the cockpit. And they are particularly harsh at 
the Irish budget airline, which even forces employees to pay for water when they work.Today New York, next week 
Bangkok. Overnight stays in luxury hotels and the pleasant company of young flight attendants. The old cliches 
surrounding pilots are not dead — on the contrary, popular films like "Catch me if you can" keep the dream 
alive.The reality looks quite different though. Now there is almost something like a proletariat of young pilots who 
have become hopelessly entangled in debt on their way to realizing their dreams of flying.Surprisingly, wannabe 
pilots usually have to pay all or almost all of their training costs themselves. Yet inexperienced pilots often can't find 
a permanent job with an airline, which adds to the problem of growing debt. Many owe up to €150,000 ($172,000) 
and more.Pay yourself Increasingly young pilots, who have already passed their theoretical examinations and have 
practical experience in simulators or even in small private aircraft, are paying to fly on commercial aircraft in the 
copilot's seat, since this is the only way they can obtain certification, which is a prerequisite for a career as a 
commercial pilot.This "pay-to-fly" principle is sometimes applied at the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair too, according 
to insiders. Young pilots are not paid for flying, but have to pay for the pleasure of sitting in the cockpit, making 
flying one of the only jobs you actually have to buy.Many young pilots often live for years in near-poverty. So it's no 
wonder that a job in the cockpit has long ceased to be a dream job, especially since young people can earn much 
more in the communications or finance industries.Who wants to work at Ryanair? At Ryanair, which is the second-
largest airline in Europe and carried 128 million passengers last year, the situation of pilots is often particularly 
precarious. As one of the world's biggest budget airlines it is also considered one of the worst employers among 
pilots. This frustration has been building up for many years and has now exploded in the current pilot strike.Pilots 
had already left the low-cost airline in droves — reportedly over 700 alone in the past fiscal year. "That does not 
surprise me," says James Atkinson, a former Ryanair pilot who sat in the cockpit of Boeing jets from 2006 to 2014 
and is now working for a Chinese airline, where he is much better paid.According to the German pilot association 
Cockpit, starting salaries at Ryanair are between €25,000 and €30,000 a year. After five years, copilots can earn 
€70,000. Experienced captains make a maximum of €130,000.Chinese companies by contrast offer experienced 
pilots up to €300,000, usually with a far better working climate, but one that is far from home. In contrast to the 
young copilots, there is a shortage of experienced captains worldwide. They have the choice whether they want to 
continue working under poor conditions or if they go somewhere else.No water on the jobIt has been part of 
Ryanair's strategy to divide its employees across Europe at over 80 bases from Lithuania and Morocco to Ireland 
and Cyprus. In almost every country, pay is regulated differently and many pilots are not even salaried employees, 
but forced to work as independent contractors and must therefore pay double social security contributions, once as 
an 'entrepreneur' and once as an employee. This fragmentation is deliberate and has long made it difficult for 
Being a pilot isn't what it used to be
employees to organize together.Permanent employment on the same terms is therefore one of the most important 
demands of pilots. They are particularly angry at the fact that, in contrast to almost all other airlines, only actual 
flight hours are paid and not the time on the ground or hours due to delays. Even with a delay of several hours, 
employees receive neither pay nor money for expenses like necessary overnight stays.James Atkinson reports, "On 
my days off I was regularly asked to fly at my own expense to other Ryanair bases where there were staff 
shortages," where he then had to help out. "Sometimes I flew exhausting shifts for five days before the laborious 
return journey to my home base. In summer I often spent only three days at my own base before having to go on 
and fill another shortage. This kind of thing is killing you," Atkinson said.And it is exactly this "ping-pong" of 
unpredictable transfers from one base to another that is one of the pilots' main criticisms. Not to mention absurdities 
such as the fact that they even have to pay for their own water or coffee when on board. "No employee gets a water 
bottle for free from Ryanair. If you want one, you have to buy it," according to Atkinson.

on Google+ Share on LinkedInRyanair is facing the biggest industrial action in its history in peak summer season, 
disrupting hundreds of flights and affecting thousands of passengers. The Irish low-cost carrier has cancelled 400 
out of its 2,400 European flights scheduled for Friday as pilots in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland and 
Sweden are on strike. 
This will affect 55,000 passengers or 15% of its schedule, according to the company. Germany expects to see 250 
cancellations. Strike action will continue on Saturday; Ryanair is offering its customers rerouting or compensation. 
The company has tried to avoid strike action, trying to secure an urgent court order in the Netherlands. The 
company's demands were rejected in court. The industrial action in the summer of 2018 is the biggest in the 
company's 33-year history. In July strike action was driven by combined action by cockpit and cabin crews, 
cancelling 600 flights and affecting 100,000 travellers in Belgium, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain. The cross-
border action is now scaling up. Since recognizing unions and collective bargaining in December 2017. According 
to the unions, by ruling out rises for cockpit crew, the company leaves no room for a compromise. The company 
says its payroll should be compared to other budget airlines. Pilots want their earnings to become comparable to 
those in competing airlines. But, the company says it has already offered a 20% increase this year. Moreover, all 
the personnel is demanding contracts in the countries they are based rather than Irish contracts. The reason is that 
Irish contracts mean they cannot access benefits available in their country of origin. The company's CEO Michael 
O' Leary is now threatening to move part of its fleet from Ireland to low-cost Poland, threatening 100 pilot jobs. 
Talking to the German regional broadcaster RBB on Thursday, the deputy secretary general of the European Trade 
Union Confederation, Peter Scherrer, welcomed the Ryanair walkout saying that this strike showed what can 
happen when companies operating across Europe try to play workers against each other. For 2018, Ryanair 
projects profits in the region of €1.25bn, despite surging fuel costs. The Irish carrier flies in 37 countries. Share on

Aug 09, 2018( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  Artificial intelligence (AI) is 
helping Heathrow Airport eradicate gender bias by replacing potentially off-putting words with more 'inclusive' 
alternatives. The airport has started using the programme Textio, which highlights gendered phrasing in the 
airport's job listings and suggests more 'gender-neutral' replacements.Words that were replaced include 'perfection', 
which was changed to 'excellence', while the word 'meaningful' was found to be better than 'challenging'. Job 
listings that asked for certain skills were screened to remove the phrase 'is essential' to 'is important'.Heathrow 
invested in the technology just weeks after it launched its women in aviation and aerospace charter at the 
Farnborough air show, which is designed to recruit more women and historically underrepresented people to apply 
for roles.The Textio software works by identifying which words and language patterns attract the most diverse pool 
of applicants. 
Companies using the software have reportedly seen a 23 per cent increase in the number of female candidates.The 
aviation industry endures a legacy problem of struggling to recruit female employees.The gender pay gap at 
Ryanair[1] stands at 67 per cent, meaning women earned 33p for every 1 men earned. Easyjet, meanwhile, 
launched the Amy Johnson initiative in 2015 to boost the number of its female pilots, and has set a target for 20 per 
cent of its new cadets to be female by 2020.Talking about the introduction Fiona Tice, Heathrow's talent and 
development director, said: As we continue to refine our expansion plans and look to significantly increase the 
number of people working at our airport, it is crucial that we do all that we can to attract the most talented 
individuals to Heathrow and create more gender equality in our sector Heathrow Airport uses artificial intelligence to

pilots working for Irish no-frills carrier Ryanair are planning to strike on Friday, August 10. They are to join industrial 
action already announced by their colleagues in Ireland, Sweden and Belgium.Ryanair pilots in Germany are 
planning a 24-hour strike action this week, their union announced Wednesday.The strike is to begin shortly after 
midnight on Friday and is expected to affect all flights of the Irish airline from and to Germany, the Vereiniging 
Cockpit (VC) union said in a statement.The German pilots' industrial action is adding to strikes already planned for 
the same day in Ireland, Sweden and Belgium. Together, it would be the biggest pilots' strike in the history of 
Ryanair.So far, the carrier has already canceled 146 flights of a total of 2,400 scheduled European flights for 
Friday.Not budging an inchVC union chief Martin Locher accused Ryanair's executives of blocking a mutually 
beneficial solution at the negotiating table, with the German pilots eager to see an improvement in their working 
conditions and wages."During previous rounds of negotiations, Ryanair has always categorically ruled out any 
increase in staff costs, but it has failed to indicate where the management sees room for maneuver in the collective 
bargaining process," Locher said.Just two weeks ago, Ryanair flight attendants in Spain, Portugal and Belgium 
forced the airline to cancel some 600 flights, affecting a total of 100,000 passengers.Ryanair agreed last year to 
finally recognize unions, but it has so far failed to hammer out collective labor deals with staff across Europe.hg/sri

General 
Hospital, 
where three-time world champion Niki Lauda underwent a lung transplant last week, says the Austrian is conscious 
and making good progress. "Already 24 hours after surgery Mr Lauda could be extubated, was spontaneously 
breathing and had full consciousness," said the hospital in brief a statement. "During the following days his 
condition has further improved continuously and all organs are functioning well," it added. Meanwhile, Dr Walter 
Klepetko, who performed the operation, has told the Osterreich that it will be several weeks before he can leave the 
hospital, though, barring any unforeseen complications, he will in time "be able to fly, work and take part in sport as 
he did before". News of the Austrian's operation came on Thursday, just days after his absence at the Hungarian 
Grand Prix had been noted, the three-time champion having also missed the previous week's German Grand Prix. 
It later emerged that the 69-year-old was taken ill on holiday in Ibiza and rushed to Vienna where he was placed on 
an artificial lung ahead of surgery. The Osterreich reports that in a bid to reduce his workload, Lauda is looking to 
sell his remaining shares in LaudaMotion, the airline he bought back earlier this year and subsequently sold a 
majority share of to Ryanair.

Ryanair on Wednesday. The Dutch Airline Pilots Association (ALPA) voted in favour of industrial action, following in 
the footsteps of their German and Irish colleagues. Swedish and Belgian pilots are expected to join. Pilots are 
demanding an end to 'bogus' self-employment, lack of sufficient sick pay and pension provisions, but also a lack of 
transparency on the vacations and promotions regime. Meanwhile, the Irish low-cost carrier has faced a rollout of 
industrial action by cabin crews in Belgium, Portugal, Spain, and Italy. Ryanair chairman Michael O'Leary is 
threatening to move jobs to Poland. The company has issued Irish pilots with a protective notice, threatening layoffs 
and fleet relocation. Unions across Europe are stepping up the pressure against the Irish low-cost carrier that only 
recognized the rights to collective bargaining for its employees in December 2017. Ryanair is seeking to make 
separate agreements in each of the markets it operates and has asked for a full week's notice of strike action to 
refund or redirect passengers. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn

Aug 02, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per Reuters[1], Ryanair 
Holdings PLC's RYAAY[2] pilots in Sweden and Belgium will begin a strike on Aug 10. Further worsening the 
situation, the airline may face another set of walkouts on the same day in Germany and the Netherlands.The 
Swedish Airline Pilots Association representing around 40 Ryanair staff alleged that the airline's management has 
failed to meet the union representatives for more than eight months. Ryanair cabin crew is already on a strike in 
Belgium and unions have asked the pilots to join and support them with a stoppage on the same day.The pilots are 
looking for more transparency with regard to promotions and transfers, thus reducing undue management 
discretion. Meanwhile, the cabin crew is demanding local contracts and improved conditions.The Swedish union 
has further claimed that ever since Ryanair acknowledged unions last December, the budget carrier has failed to 
come to conclusive agreements with any union across Europe.Earlier, in July, cabin crew in Italy, Spain, Portugal 
and Belgium called for a two-day strike, forcing the carrier to cancel several flights affecting more than 50,000 
customers.Despite the back-to-back strikes, Ryanair is not likely to give in to the demands of the employees too 
soon. 
In fact, the carrier plans to move jobs away to Poland if the strikes continued to hurt its operations. Notably, the 
company is planning to shift aircraft and jobs out of Dublin as strikes in the city have affected the carrier's bookings. 
It plans to reduce the Dublin-based fleet by approximately 20% this winter.Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary 
said that the carrier is short of aircraft in almost every market and one of those is the immensely growing Polish 
market. While the Irish market has been hampered lately due to the untoward incidents, the Polish market is more 
lucrative. Thus, the airline intends to move aircraft to Poland.Shares of Ryanair have declined 9.5% in the last three 
months, primarily due to the ongoing labor unrest.Zacks Rank ...y PicksRyanair holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some 
better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector[3] are CSX Corporation CSX[4], Union Pacific 
Corporation UNP[5] and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. EXPD[6]. While CSX sports a Zacks Rank #1

Thursday.Lauda, who was badly burned in a near-fatal Formula One crash in 1976 and later became an airline

not mentioned a transplant."Because of a severe lung condition Niki Lauda had to undergo a lung transplant in 
Vienna General Hospital today," the hospital said in a statement posted on its website. "The transplant was carried 
out successfully."Lauda, 69, won three Formula One world championships, and his rivalry with British driver James

Jul 31, 2018( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  The Irish 
budget carrier has faced a wave of industrial action recently, as staff in various countries protest over pay and 
conditions. Now, some of the company's German-based pilots have voted to strike.Ryanair pilots represented by 
the German-based pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) have voted overwhelmingly for strike action in a dispute 
over pay and conditions.The union, which represents some but not all German-based Ryanair pilots, voted by 96 
percent in favor of strike action in the near future.Saying any industrial action would be announced at least 24 hours 
before it takes place, the VC said it would give Ryanair until August 6 to submit a proposal to avoid industrial 
action.Read more: Strikes continue as Ryanair flies through the eye of the storm"Since the start of our negotiations 
in January, Ryanair has been playing for time and even if Ryanair is not taking this ballot seriously, industrial action 
like in other European countries, seems unavoidable in Germany as well," said Ingolf Schumacher, chairman of 
industrial relations at the VC."We implore upon Ryanair to reverse its present way of behaving like a wrong-way 
driver towards pilot and cabin crew unions throughout Europe."Ryanair responded in a markedly more conciliatory 
fashion that in previous statements regarding the VC, with whom it was at loggerheads until entering negotiations 
earlier this year."We have written to the VC today and invited them to another meeting next week," the Irish airline 
said in a statement."We hope we can make further progress in concluding a collective labour agreement with our 
pilots in Germany."Cloudy skiesThe majority of Ryanair pilots based in Germany are direct employees unlike the 
situation in other Ryanair markets and in theory, a widely implemented strike of German-based pilots could 
significantly affect the airline's operations.However, last December, the VC held a strike of the airline's German-
based pilots but it had limited impact on Ryanair's schedules, with all the airline's flights during the affected period 
managing to take off as the airline brought in pilots from abroad.Since a cancellations crisis erupted for Ryanair last 
September following staff rostering issues, the airline has faced a series of industrial disputes and it has been 
forced to soften its long-established non-recognition approach to unions.Since the problems of late 2017, when the 
airline was forced to cancel thousands of flights due to staff shortages, it has been involved in negotiations with 
various trade unions across several countries where it operates.However, as the negotiations — and recognition of 
trade unions — have gone on, the amount of strikes the airline has faced has increased. 
Irish-based Ryanair pilots have held a number of strikes in recent weeks while last week, cabin crew in Spain, 
Portugal and Belgium held strikes, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights.While the airline has warned its 
profits will suffer this year as a result of the ongoing strife, it announced record profits for last year, despite the 
issues it had.

Europe-wide strike. 
The Irish low-cost carrier is facing cabin crews strike action in Portugal, Belgium, Italy and Spain. It is also facing 
strike action by Irish pilots. More than 600 Ryanair flights have been cancelled over the last few weeks, eating into 
20% of Ryanair's quarterly profits. The German pilots neared consensus on strike action (96%), demanding 
transparency over pay and working conditions. Negotiations with Ryanair reached a dead end on Friday. The 
German pilot union (VC) will take action unless Ryanair responds to their demands by Monday, August 6; VC have 
a press conference scheduled for Wednesday, August 8. Only about a quarter of Ryanair's Irish pilots are directly 
employed by the airline; in Germany, pilots flying for the Irish carrier are directly employed by the company. A strike 
in Germany would be more disruptive. The Irish pilot union (Fórsa) have accused Ryanair of failing to negotiate with 
pilots, choosing instead to 'brief them' as to the extent of job cuts as a result of their strike action. Ryanair says they 
have met nine out of the Irish union's 11 requests. Ryanair is notorious for its hardline negotiating attitude against 
unions; the Irish carrier was forced to recognize unions in December 2017. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter

Jul 27, 2018( IT Pro: http://www.itpro.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  Amazon Web Services (AWS) has raked in $6.1 
billion for the online retail giant and technology firm in its 2018 second quarter financial results. Given the trend of 
digital transformation running through companies looking to move from legacy on-premise IT infrastructure to more 
cloud-powered services, it is no surprise that AWS is seeing growth in cloud revenue.However, the second quarter 
was arguably notable given AWS added Ryanair, Major League Baseball, 21st Century Fox and Epic Games to its 
healthy customer roster. 
Compared to the same quarter in 2017, which hit 4.1bn in net sales, AWS made nearly 50% more in its latest 
quarter. But that growth also meant an increase in operating expenses, which rose from $3.18bn in 2017's second 
quarter to $4.46bn in the same quarter for 2018. Nevertheless, operating income for AWS was rose from $916 
million to $1.6bn, demonstrating the rude health AWS is in and its potential to generate a healthy income for 
Amazon, which still makes the bulk of its money through product sales via its online store. In total, Amazon 
increased its total product and services sales to $52.9bn, a 39% increase on the same time 12 months earlier, and 
a record sales quarter for the company. With Amazon continuing to add more services and features into its AWS 
cloud platform and offerings, ranging from supporting database workloads to powering smart software and data 
analytics systems, AWS is likely to be at the heart of future Amazon growth. AWS is currently the leader in the 
public cloud, and while Microsoft's Azure cloud platform and Google Cloud are in second and third place 
respectively, they both have more work to do to catch AWS' reach. Image credit: Bigstock

Google+ Share on LinkedInRyanair, Easyjet, Wizz and the owners of British Airways/Iberia (IAG) have submitted 
complaints to the European Commission against France. Submitted on Tuesday, the airlines suggest that an air 
traffic control (ATC) strike in France is restricting freedom of movement. The country should be obliged to facilitate 
overfly transit while the strike continues, the airlines argue. Circumventing French airspace for the duration of the 
strike is costing companies in fuel, just as international prices are soaring. Companies such as Ryanair are 
demanding that the French 'national strike' does not undermine freedom of movement. Meanwhile, Ryanair is facing 
its own strike hurdles, with pilots in Ireland and cabin crews in Belgium, Spain and Portugal demanding better 
working conditions. Pilots demand mainly more transparency on pay, promotions and leave. Cabin crews have a 
wider range of demands. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn

Strikes continue as Ryanair flies through the eye of the storm

Jul 26, 2018( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  The Irish 
airline refused to recognize unions for decades but now finds itself facing strikes and cancellations at every turn. 
Shareholders are worried, passengers are annoyed. Can they fly through the gloom?Ryanair has never been short 
of critics, but for most of its 33-year history, the airline has had two powerful characteristics that set it apart from its 
competitors — its flights were hardly ever cancelled and they invariably took off on time.That core reliability — and 
the rather crucial fact that Ryanair fares were often the cheapest — helped offset the sometimes less-than-cuddly 
aspects of their offering.Its business model, largely based on that of US carrier Southwest, made the Irish airline 
into a phenomenal success story. 
In 1985, Ryanair flew just one route, yet today, going by its stock market capitalization of €16.7 billion ($19.56 
billion), it is the biggest airline in Europe.However, recent events have shaken Ryanair's treasured image of 
reliability. Following a cancellations crisis late last year, when the airline was forced to scrap thousands of flights 
due to rostering issues, it agreed to recognize unions for the first time.Staff tensions have risen since. Having gone 
20 years without meaningful industrial action, Ryanair staff in several different countries have gone on strike in 
recent months. On Wednesday and Thursday this week, cabin crew strikes in Spain, Portugal and Belgium led to 
the cancellation of 600 flights, affecting around 100,000 passengers.The damage to the airline's brand has been 
considerable. Its chief operating officer said this week that forward bookings were "being damaged" by rolling 
strikes and warned of job cuts.So what has happened to turn Ryanair from a resolutely reliable airline to one where 
strikes are happening regularly enough to stop people from booking?A long, hot summer of discontentThe summer 
actually started nicely for Ryanair. Back in May, the airline announced that profits for the period from April 2017 to 
March 2018 had increased by 10 percent, with net profit rising to €1.45 billion. This was particularly welcome news 
given that the time period in question included the 2017 cancellations mess.Yet the airline warned of turbulence 
ahead, saying higher fuel and staff costs in 2018 would hurt future profits. Also set to return was the unwelcome 
topic of flight cancellations.The trouble started when a union representing Ryanair pilots in Britain threatened strike 
action at the end of May. Then in early July, members of the Irish Airline Pilots' Association (IALPA) employed by 
Ryanair announced strike action, which took place over a few different days in Dublin. The following day, cabin 
crew in Spain, Portugal and Belgium announced strike action which takes place this week.With many Ryanair staff 
and contractors either not involved with a union or represented by separate unions, the strike action affected a 
relatively small percentage of flights and passengers.Yet Ryanair's summer difficulties were compounded by 
problems elsewhere in European skies, not least in France where a series of air traffic controller strikes caused 
major disruption for planes crossing the country. That led to flights cancelled across Europe with major airlines such 
as Ryanair and EasyJet particularly affected.Time to grow upThe striking Ryanair staff have different grievances, 
Strikes continue as Ryanair flies through the eye of the storm
ranging from cabin crew in Spain, Portugal and Belgium wanting their employment rights to be based on the laws of 
those countries rather than Ireland (where Ryanair is based), to Irish pilots who are unhappy over issues around 
base transfers, promotions and annual leave.Strikes are a prominent feature of the aviation industry, so what is 
arguably more significant than the nuts and bolts of the individual grievances in the Ryanair case is the fact that the 
strikes are happening at all, given the airline's long history of not recognizing unions.Since officially recognizing pilot 
unions last December, Ryanair has been negotiating with other trade unions and in June, it recognized cabin crew 
trade unions in Italy and Britain for the first time. Yet it is a simple fact of industrial relations that once a union is 
recognized, the possibility of a strike happening dramatically increases — that's what a union is for, after all.Ryanair 
described itself as being "cautiously pessimistic" at the start of the current financial year and appears to have 
factored in ongoing industrial relations issues as an inevitable consequence of its rapid growth. The airline's boss 
Michael O'Leary has been saying for a few years now that it is time for the airline to "grow up"."We are morphing 
from being unruly teenagers into being a bit more sensible young 20-year-olds," he said in 2014. "But we are still 
going to grow quickly."Blue and yellow skies ahead?It is the question of growth that goes to the heart of the 
situation Ryanair finds itself in. Being a maverick of the aviation sector served it extremely well for three decades 
and allowed it to grow at a remarkable rate, leaving prestigious but stuffy national carriers such as Lufthansa, Air 
France-KLM and British Airwaystrailing in its slipstream on practically every metric — and gunning for it as a 
result.Read more: Up in the air? Ryanair's growing painsRyanair currently carries more than 130 million passengers 
a year but in keeping with its long-established growth strategy, wants to increase that to around 200 million within 
the next five years. That aim, if realized, has obvious implications for Ryanair's competitors and for their staff 
unions, many of whom are the unions which represent striking Ryanair staff.Ryanair itself also has to significantly 
improve its relationship with its employees and improve their conditions. This is an inevitable consequence of its 
evolution from being a maverick with a 'take it or leave it' approach on most issues to a long-established, mass 
market player in global aviation.Strikes and cancellations may well be a feature for Ryanair for several years to 
come, as its relationship with unions continues to evolve. From Ryanair's perspective, it will do well to avoid the 
pitfalls other major airlines have faced during that journey.There may be occasional profit falls and share price 
swoons, with plenty of negative headlines certain to follow. Yet Ryanair has shown a dogged ability to limit the 
damage during previous strikes and there is little reason to doubt that they can continue to do that, given the scale 
of their resources.More significantly, Ryanair's key digits still look in excellent shape — despite the current 
problems, the airline expects to make well over €1 billion in profit this year alone. So while more of their planes 
have been grounded than ever before over the past 10 months, there are solid reasons to believe they can fly 
through the storm.

Jul 26, 2018( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Clodagh 
Kilcoyne/Reuters Ryanair[1], an Irish, ultra-low cost carrier, has been struggling with staffing[2] as Dublin-based 
pilots and flight crew strike[3] for better benefits and pay. Ryanair announced on Wednesday[4] that it's cutting its 
Dublin-based fleet from 30 to 24 aircraft. In letters to about 300 crew members on Wednesday, Chief People Officer 
Eddie Wilson advised Ryanair employees to move to Poland to avoid being laid off, Bloomberg reported[5].Cabin 
crew at Ryanair[6] have been battling for better benefits and pay. Last week alone, the Dublin-based carrier 
canceled flights for 50,000 passengers[7] due to strikes. 
In light of recent labor disputes, the low-budget airline announced Wednesday[8] that it will cut six of its 30 planes 
from its Dublin fleet. More than 100 Dublin-based pilots and 200 cabin crew employees may be laid off as soon as 
Oct. 28, according to a Ryanair press release[9]. The adviceChief People Officer Eddie Wilson gave to workers 
whose jobs were in sudden jeopardy: Move to Poland. "We would encourage both pilots and cabin crew to update 
your base transfer requests as an immediate priority," Wilson wrote in a letter reported by Bloomberg[10]. Those six 
Dublin-based planes are moving to Ryanair's Polish arm, Ryanairchief operating officer Peter Bellew wrote in a 
press release[11]. That's thanks to growth in the Polish market as well as the Irish pilots' protesting, according to 
the airline. "We regret these base aircraft reductions at Dublin for Winter 2018, but the Board has decided to 
allocate more aircraft to those markets where we are enjoying strong growth,"Bellew wrote. "This will result in some 
aircraft reductions and job cuts in country markets where business has weakened, or forward bookings are being 
damaged by rolling strikes by Irish pilots," he wrote. Labor advocates said that the Dublin fleet reduction[12] is a 
way to avoid working out a new labor agreement for the pilots and airline. Some of the demands by cabin crew 
include better sick pay and an end to high in-flight sales targets, The Telegraph reported[13]. Low-cost carriers 
provide a 'highly precarious' work environment — but consumers love the cheap ticketsLow-budget airlines have 
exploded in popularity over the past few decades[14]. Ryanair, founded in 1985, was among the first ultra low-cost 
carriers. Now, low-cost carriers comprise more than 40% of all flights in Europe and about a third of flights in the 
US, Business Insider reported[15].Carriers like KLM Royal Dutch Airlines[16] have had to lower their costs in 
response, KLMCEO Pieter Elbers told Business Insider last year[17]. One major way that low-cost carriers are able 
to keep their ticket prices low is by basing their companies in several different countries. Norwegian Air, for 
instance, is based in Ireland and Norway. Ireland's lax labor laws allows the company to staff its planes with pilots 
and crew members from outside of Europe, Business Insider's Ben Zhang reported[18]. Ryanair is no stranger to 
trying to side-step international labor laws, as well. Last year[19], it insisted to the European Union courts that its 
Ryanair warns more than 300 pilots and flight crew members to move to Poland or risk losing their jobs
non-Irish cabin crew should come to Ireland when it has disputes with the Dublin-based carrier. It ultimately lost[20]. 
AsZhang reported[21], low-cost carriers can also offer rock bottom prices because they operate with lower 
overhead than their full-service competitors. This tends to mean less generous pay and benefits for employees. But 
now, some analysts say Ryanair's middling pay and benefits are working against the company. "Ryanair has a 
highly transactional relationship with staff and one that is highly precarious for workers, but now also clearly for the 
airline," Geraint Harvey, a senior lecturer in human resources management and industrial relations at the University 
of Birmingham, told German media company DW[22].NOW WATCH: One of your most important career decisions

Jul 26, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Amazon AMZN[1] just 
reported its second quarter financial results. But while many people assess the e-commerce giant's top and bottom 
line growth and its online sales, let's take a look at how the Amazon Web Services unit performed, since Amazon's 
cloud computing business remains one of its most important growth areas.Amazon is still a retail company at its 
core, with its $27.17 billion in online store sales accounting for over 50% of its $52.89 billion total Q2 revenues. The 
firm's overall revenues climbed by 39% from the year-ago period, which fell short of our $53.45 billion Zacks 
Consensus Estimate.Meanwhile, the Seattle-based company reported adjusted earnings of $5.07 per share, 
crushing our $2.49 per share estimate. 
But Amazon's online sales only climbed by 14%, which means the company's huge growth must have come from 
somewhere else. Third-party seller services did surge by 39% to $9.70 billion, making it the company's second-
largest revenue driver, right in front of AWS.Play Video[2] Amazon's AWS business skyrocketed 49% from $4.10 
billion to hit $6.12 billion in the second quarter. Investors should note that this topped our NFM estimateof $5.99 
billion and marked the company's biggest year-over-year gain over the last six quarters in this growing 
category.Furthermore, AWS saw its revenues climb by 12% sequentially. Last quarter, Amazon's AWS unit saw its 
revenues surge 48% from $3.66 billion to touch $5.44 billion. Amazon's cloud computing unit is up 46% over the 
trailing 12 months at $21.24 billion.Amazon also noted that it added several new AWS enterprise customers during 
the quarter, including Ryanair RYAAY[3] and Fortnite owner Epic Games. Adding more clients will become more 
important going forward as the company faces more competition from Microsoft MSFT[4], Google GOOGL[5], and 
IBM IBM[6]. 'AWS had the unusual advantage of a seven-year head start before facing like-minded competition, 
and the team has never slowed down,' CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement last quarter.The Hottest Tech Mega-
Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to 
$47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce "the world's first trillionaires," but that should still leave 
plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend

Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free[6]. Here are highlights 
from Wednesday's Analyst Blog:Airline Stock Roundup: Q2 Earnings EditionIn the past week, key airline players 
like JetBlue Airways Corp. and Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. unveiled their respective quarterly numbers. Although both 
the companies reported better-than-expected earnings per share, the metric contracted on a year-over-year basis 
mainly due to high fuel costs. Both the US-based carriers reported lower-than-expected revenues as well.European 
low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc revealed its first-quarter fiscal 2019 (ended Jun 30, 2018) financial numbers. 
High costs and low average air fares resulted in the carrier's profit after tax declining 20%.On the non-earnings 
front, the China-Taiwan controversy grabbed headlines with carriers like American Airlines Group Inc. and Delta Air 
Lines, Inc. planning to comply[7] with China's demands of changing their reference pertaining to Taiwan on the 
airlines' websites.(Read the last Airline Stock Roundup for Jul 18, 2018[8])Recap of the Past Week's Most 
Important Stories 1. JetBlue Airways' second-quarter 2018 earnings per share (excluding 76 cents from non-
recurring items) of 38 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 36 cents. However, the bottom line 
decreased significantly on a year-over-year basis primarily due to high fuel costs (read more: JetBlue Tops Q2 
Earnings Estimates, Declines Y/Y[9]).Apart from the earnings report, the carrier was in the news when it revealed 
its intention to trim the workforce in a bid to cut costs. The reductions will reportedly[10] be through layoffs, buyouts 
and attrition.2. Hawaiian Holdings' second-quarter earnings (excluding 12 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.44 
per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26. However, quarterly revenues of $715.4 million fell 
short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $717.8 million. While earnings per share decreased, revenues increased 
on a year-over-year basis.Operating revenue per available seat mile in the quarter climbed 0.7% year over year. 
The metric is projected to be down 1.5% to up 1.5% on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter of 2018. The 
same is expected to grow in the band of 1-3% for 2018.Capacity is projected to grow between 7.5% and 9.5% in the 
third quarter. The metric is expected to increase in the band of 5.5-7.5% for 2018. CASM, excluding fuel, is also 
projected to rise significantly for the ongoing quarter primarily owing to rising labor costs. Fuel cost per gallon 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: JetBlue Airways , Hawaiian Holdings , Ryanair Holdings , American Airlines 
Group and Delta Air Lines
(economic) is anticipated to be in the band of $2.10-$2.20 in the third quarter. The metric is envisioned in the $2.05-
$2.15 band for 2018.Hawaiian Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's 
Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[11].3. Ryanair Holdings reported financial and operating numbers with net 
profit of €319 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, down 20% year over year due to a 4% decline in average 
airfares. The top line expanded 9% to €2,079 million on the back of a 7% rise in traffic. Moreover, load factor came 
in at 96%. During the quarter, the carrier returned €265 million to shareholders through buybacks.The carrier 
expects airfares to rise only 1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with a 4% rise predicted earlier. 
Profit after tax in fiscal 2019 is projected at €1.25 billion. The carrier remains concerned about a Brexit-related 
impact.4. U.S. based carriers are likely to comply with China's request pertaining to Taiwan in the next few days. 
China had requested the carriers to refer Taiwan in their respective websites as 'China Taiwan' or the 'China 
Taiwan region.' The request, made in April, had asked the carriers not to refer Taiwan in any other manner.Today,

With cash concerns clouding Tesla 's future, will the dawn yet break for Elon Musk and Co?
With cash concerns clouding Tesla's future, will the dawn yet break for Elon 
Musk and Co?

Jul 25, 2018( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Despite 
breaking into the notoriously impenetrable auto industry and building popular electric cars, Tesla and its boss Elon 
Musk have had a rough ride lately. Is the end nigh for them, or is the dawn about to break?"I'm definitely under 
stress so if I seem like I'm under stress, then I want to be clear, I am definitely under stress." So said Elon Musk, 
Tesla's CEO and front man, when a TV crew from US network CBS came to visit him at the company's massive 
Silicon Valley factory back in April.In the intervening three months, it is fair to say that Musk has seemed like a man 
under stress.He has involved himself in several unseemly disputes on social media and with journalists, ranging 
from a row with an illustrator over a picture of a unicorn to much more serious incidents, such as when he called a 
diver involved in the rescue of children trapped in a Thai cave "a pedo," after the diver dismissed Musk's proposed 
involvement in the rescue as a PR stunt.Musk's charisma has always been a big part of Tesla's PR strategy and in 
much the same way that Ryanair have used Michael O'Leary's oversize personality to promote their wares, Tesla 
have done the same with Musk rather than use conventional advertising.Yet Musk's recent Twitter paroxysms have 
created a raft of negative headlines for Tesla at a time when they need as much goodwill as they can get.The 
company is a world leader in electric vehicle and battery production, but for years now, has existed with the 
persistent suggestion that it will eventually run out of money as its speed of production simply isn't fast enough to 
keep up with its colossal costs.Model professionalsThe situation has been particularly pronounced in 2018. Musk 
vowed late last year that Tesla's Model 3 car, seen as a 'mass market' vehicle for the company and therefore critical 
to the share price and ultimate hopes of long-term profitability would reach production rates of 5,000 units per week 
by December.Read more: Tesla to open factory in China, expects to manufacture 500,000 cars annuallyAfter 
several delays, some caused by issues with assembly line robots, others to do with battery technology, the target 
was finally reached in the final week of June. 
However, news came this week that Tesla had written to suppliers asking them to refund a portion of what Tesla 
itself had previously spent for products, in order to help the car company to become officially profitable.Tesla 
defended the action, saying it was limited to a small number of suppliers and should be seen simply as a form of 
negotiation. "Now that we're in a stronger position with Model 3 production ramping, it is a good time to improve our 
competitive advantage in this area," a statement from the company said.Gene Munster, from US venture capital 
firm Loup Ventures, told DW that much of the reaction to this news drew the wrong conclusion, namely that Tesla's 
short-term future was in peril."I think it is a somewhat misleading conclusion to say they are doing this to try to save 
the company," he said.Tesla have made major strides in the development of electric cars but their highly complex 
technical requirements — and the requirements of the factory that makes them — come with a huge financial 
With cash concerns clouding Tesla 's future, will the dawn yet break for Elon Musk and Co?
burden, with the company spending around $1 billion (€855 million) every quarter.Tesla reduced their workforce by 
almost 10 percent in June in an attempt to cut costs, while Musk wrote to employees last month, saying: "What 
drives us is our mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable, clean energy, but we will never achieve 
that mission unless we eventually demonstrate that we can be sustainably profitable."A groundbreaking 
achievementRegardless of its obvious potential to dominate the electric sector into the future, Tesla needs to start 
making money eventually to fully convince the wider business and investor community. The company has plenty of 
doubters, not least famed short-seller Jim Chanos, who has repeatedly questioned the company's long-term 
survival prospects.Musk's recent outbursts have not helped sooth those doubters but it is worth remembering that 
what Tesla have already achieved in the automotive industry suggests that they shouldn't be written off too 
easily."The auto industry is a capital intensive endeavor and in order to be a player in auto, just to get into the 
game, it's very, very rare that new companies come in. To do something at scale is even more difficult," Munster 
said.Yet Tesla have, if not quite doing that, come extremely close and may yet achieve it on a long-term basis. And 
while their costs currently outweigh what they are taking in due to the production speed issues, they recently had 
well over 400,000 orders on their books, although some reports suggest the continuing uncertainty over production 
has led to large volumes of cancellations.Before the dawnMunster, whose company has done extensive research 
on trends in artificial intelligence and robotics, two key platforms of Tesla's operation, believes claims made about 
the company's viability have been exaggerated. "There is a probability that they won't make it, but I would put that 
at 5 percent that they won't and 95 percent that they will."He believes that something that has been lost amid 
Musk's recent volley of tweets is the fact that Tesla is ultimately trying to do something good — to build 
environmentally sustainable cars with high levels of drivability for a mass market.Read more: Tesla struggles to 
calm investors and employeesAs well as that, should Tesla do enough to weather their current cash storm — and 
steady their stumbling share price — the future may well yet belong to them. They have built up a currently 
unrivalled knowledge base on electric vehicles, a potentially major advantage given the major global shift towards 
electric vehicles, accelerated since the outrage of Dieselgate."The other piece that gets missed in this is that it is 
such a big trend that is in front of Tesla — such a powerful opportunity — that even if they had cash needs that are 
unexpected, I am confident that investors would step up and give them the proper money to stay in business if it 
comes to that," said Munster.The stresses are likely to continue for Musk and Tesla into the foreseeable future, 
given the legitimate questions they must answer about their ability to stay in business.Yet given the equally 
legitimate reasons to believe in the company's prospects of a bright future in a rapidly changing industry, betting 
against them at this point is a move that ought to be doubted too.

Holdings plc RYAAY[3] revealed its first-quarter fiscal 2019 (ended Jun 30, 2018) financial numbers. High costs and 
low average air fares resulted in the carrier's profit after tax declining 20%.On the non-earnings front, the China-
Taiwan controversy grabbed headlines with carriers like American Airlines Group Inc. AAL[4] and Delta Air Lines, 
Inc. DAL[5] planning to comply[6] with China's demands of changing their reference pertaining to Taiwan on the 
airlines' websites.(Read the lastAirline Stock Roundup for Jul 18, 2018[7])Recap of the Past Week's Most Important 
Stories 1. JetBlue Airways' second-quarter 2018 earnings per share (excluding 76 cents from non-recurring items) 
of 38 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 36 cents. However, the bottom line decreased significantly 
on a year-over-year basis primarily due to high fuel costs (read more: JetBlue Tops Q2 Earnings Estimates, 
Declines Y/Y[8]).Apart from the earnings report, the carrier was in the news when it revealed its intention to trim the 
workforce in a bid to cut costs. The reductions will reportedly[9] be through layoffs, buyouts and attrition.2. Hawaiian 
Holdings' second-quarter earnings (excluding 12 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.44 per share outpaced the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26. However, quarterly revenues of $715.4 million fell short of the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of $717.8 million. While earnings per share decreased, revenues increased on a year-over-
year basis.Operating revenue per available seat mile in the quarter climbed 0.7% year over year. The metric is 
projected to be down 1.5% to up 1.5% on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter of 2018. The same is expected 
to grow in the band of 1-3% for 2018.Capacity is projected to grow between 7.5% and 9.5% in the third quarter. The 
metric is expected to increase in the band of 5.5-7.5% for 2018. CASM, excluding fuel, is also projected to rise 
significantly for the ongoing quarter primarily owing to rising labor costs. Fuel cost per gallon (economic) is 
anticipated to be in the band of $2.10-$2.20 in the third quarter. The metric is envisioned in the $2.05-$2.15 band 
for 2018.Hawaiian Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank

million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, down 20% year over year due to a 4% decline in average airfares. The top 
line expanded 9% to €2,079 million on the back of a 7% rise in traffic. Moreover, load factor came in at 96%. During 
the quarter, the carrier returned €265 million to shareholders through buybacks.The carrier expects airfares to rise

Jul 24, 2018( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Four 
European airlines have complained to the European Commission over what they say is France's failure to tackle 
strikes by air traffic controllers. They say the strikes are hindering people's freedom of movement.British Airways 
owner IAG, easyJet, Ryanair and Wizz Air on Tuesday lodged a complaint to the EU over strikes by air traffic 
controllers (ATCs) in France. 
The airlines argued that repeated strikes by France's air traffic controllers, particularly in the south, are having a 
devastating impact on schedules and denying passengers their legal right to free movement.Read more: Jump in 
German flight delays stokes fears of travel chaos IAG and Ryanair warned in June that they would file a complaint. 
They have now been joined by Hungarian no-frills carrier Wizz Air and British counterpart easyJet."International 
Airlines Group (IAG), Ryanair, easyJet and Wizz Air have submitted complaints to the European Commission 
against France as its air traffic controllers' strikes restrict the fundamental principle of freedom of movement within 
the EU," the airlines said in a joint statement. "The airlines are not questioning the right to strike but believe France 
is breaking EU law by not enabling flights over the country during strikes." According to the statement, French air 
traffic control strikes have quadrupled this year compared with 2017.Aviation delays"The right to strike needs to be 
balanced against freedom of movement," said IAG chief executive Willie Walsh."It's not only customers flying in and 
out of France who are affected during French ATC strikes. "Passengers on routes that overfly France, especially 
the large airspace that covers Marseille and the Mediterranean, are also subject to delays and massive 
disruptions," said Walsh.A French senate report in June said that the country's air traffic control was responsible for 
a third of all aviation delays in Europe, according to Le Parisien newspaper.Between 2004 and 2016, French air 
traffic controllers were on strike for 254 days, vastly outstripping their closest rival Greece, where there were 46 
days of stoppages and Italy with 37, according to the report seen by the French daily.sri/tr (AFP, dpa)

Jul 23, 2018( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair 
said its first-quarter profit dropped more than a fifth due to higher fuel costs and salaries for pilots. The budget 
carrier is under growing pressure to improve pay and conditions for its staff.Irish no-frills airline Ryanair on Monday 
said that its first-quarter net profit slid about 20 percent year-on-year to €319 million ($373 million), as average fares 
fell 4 percent amid some overcapacity in Europe and an early Easter peak. 
Higher fuel and staff costs, and strikes by Ryanair pilots and international air traffic controllers (ATC), also affected 
financial performance, it said.Read more: Lufthansa largest European airline by passenger numbersIn the three 
months to the end of June, Ryanair noted that "staff costs increased by 34 percent primarily due to pilot 20 percent 
pay increases, nine percent more flight hours and a three percent general pay increase for our non-flight staff."The 
Dublin-based carrier also pointed out that oil prices had "risen substantially from $50 per barrel at this time last year 
to almost $80 per barrel." The company said it still expected to achieve its annual profit forecast of €1.25 billion to 
€1.35 billion.Despite the dip in profit, Ryanair said it had managed to increase its passenger traffic and revenue. 
"Traffic grew 7 percent, to 37.6 million, despite over 2,500 flight cancellations caused by ATC staff shortages and 
ATC strikes," Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said. Revenue increased 9 percent to almost €2.1 billion, the firm 
said.Staff discontentThe earnings update comes as Ryanair faces strikes this week by some pilots and cabin crew 
despite group efforts in recent months to improve pay and conditions. Some of the carrier's Ireland-based pilots will 
carry out a third one-day strike on Tuesday, resulting in the cancellation of 16 flights.And the airline has cancelled 
600 flights in Europe that had been due Wednesday and Thursday, owing to strikes by cabin crew staff in Spain, 
Portugal and Belgium.Read more: Jump in German flight delays stokes fears of travel chaos"Despite signing pilot 
and cabin crew union recognition agreements in our major markets — the UK and Italy, and a recent agreement in 
Germany... progress has been slower in smaller markets," Ryanair said in Monday's statement."While we continue 
to actively engage with pilot and cabin crew unions across Europe, we expect further strikes over the peak summer 
period as we are not prepared to concede to unreasonable demands that will compromise either our low fares or 
our highly efficient model," it added.sri/tr (AFP, dpa)

Jul 19, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The Boeing Company 
BA[1] is set to release second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 25, before the opening bell. Results in the to-be-reported 
quarter are anticipated to be primarily driven by regular contract wins and higher commercial jet deliveries.Let's take 
a detailed look at the factors influencing Boeing's quarterly results.Multiple Contract Wins — A Key CatalystBoeing 
is the largest aircraft manufacturer and one of the major aerospace and defense contractors in the United States. 
Therefore, it enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from both the Pentagon as well as foreign allies, courtesy of the 
company's varied product offerings.In the second quarter, the company received a number of big orders for its 
commercial jets. These orders include a $6.6-billion order for 12 767-Freighters and 12 777-Freighters from FedEx 
Express, a $5.6-billion order for 20 787-9 Dreamliners from Bamboo Airways, a $3-billion order from Ryanair for 25 
737 Max-8 jets and a $1.7-billion order from Qatar Airways for five 777 Freighters.Among the defense contracts 
won in the second quarter, the significant ones include a $430- million delivery order to provide F/A-18 planned 
maintenance interval-1 high flight hour depot support, a $416-million modification contract for the full-rate 
production of three P-8A multi-mission maritime aircraft of the 9th lot and a $312-million modification contract for 
providing Joint Direct Attack Munition tail kits.Thus, it goes without saying that such steady inflow of contract wins 
will surely boost Boeing's quarterly sales. 
Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's second-quarter sales is pegged at $24 billion, 
reflecting 
a 
year-over-year 
increase 
of 
5.5%.The

and 
EPS 
Surprise 
https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/BA/price-eps-surpriseThe Boeing Company Price and EPS Surprise[2] | The 
Boeing Company Quote[3]Q2 Deliveries ...ttom-Line ExpectationsBoeing's second-quarter deliveries reflected a 6% 
year-over-year improvement in commercial shipments. However, defense shipments declined 64.4% from the year-
ago figure. Notably, higher demand for the 737 jets was the primary reason behind the year-over-year improvement 
in commercial deliveries. Boeing's total deliveries were 210 units in the second quarter of 2018 compared with 228 
a year ago.On the first-quarter earnings call, the company raised 2018 earnings guidance anticipating higher 
volumes and lower tax rate. We expect these trends to be reflected in second-quarter results and in turn boost the 
company's bottom line. Moreover, solid deliveries from commercial airplane business, which constitute for more 
than 50% of Boeing's total revenues should boost the quarterly earnings. Currently, the consensus estimate for the 
company's second-quarter earnings is pegged at $3.27 per share, reflecting a solid year-over-year increase of 
28.2%.Solid Cash Flow: A BoonIn the first quarter of 2018, Boeing paid $1 billion in dividends and repurchased 8.9 
million shares for $3 billion. This reflects the company's strong balance sheet and cash flows, which in turn provide 
it with financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive 
Will Commercial Deliveries Drive Boeing 's (BA) Q2 Earnings?
acquisitions.Additionally, Boeing raised its 2018 operating cash flow guidance from $15 billion to the range of $15-
$15.5 billion. Considering this, we may expect its second-quarter results to consistently reflect such solid cash flow 
features and cash deployment capabilities as witnessed in the prior years, courtesy of multiple order wins by Boeing 
in the quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Boeing is likely to 
beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positiveEarnings ESP[4]and a Zacks 
Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell 
before they're reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter[5].Boeing has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.[6]Please note that we caution against stocks 
with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is 
seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies in the Aerospace 
sector[7] that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to 
post an earnings beat this quarter:Raytheon Company RTN[8] is expected to report second-quarter 2018 results on 
Jul 26. The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.10% and a Zacks Rank #2.Curtiss-Wright CW[9] is expected to 
report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 25. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.15% and a Zacks Rank of 
2.Embraer ERJ[10] is expected to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 27. The company has an Earnings 
ESP of +26.12% and a Zacks Rank #3.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for 
us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, 
+109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over 
the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these 
strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to

Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Grapples With Labor Unrest: Time to Dump?
Ryanair (RYAAY) Grapples With Labor Unrest: Time to Dump?

Jul 17, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  We initiated coverage on 
Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[1] on Jul 16, 2018. The stock has shed more than 2% of its value in the past six 
months mainly due to the ongoing labor unrest.Six-Month Price PerformanceOn Jul 12, Ryanair's pilots, based in 
Ireland, went on a 24-hour strike in protest against management's approach toward transfers between the carrier's 
European and African bases. The strike resulted in multiple flight cancellations and hampered travel plans of many 
passengers as Jul 12 marks the beginning of the traditional holiday fortnight in Northern Ireland. Notably, this was 
the first-ever pilot strike at Ryanair. Adding to its woes, the company's cabin staffs in Belgium, Italy, Portugal and 
Spain will go on strike on Jul 25 and 26 against management's inaction as far as their demands pertaining to higher 
pay and better working conditions are concerned. What is worse is that more strikes may follow if the labor unrest is 
not resolved.Moreover, Ryanair remains concerned about a Brexit-related impact with leisure and business travel 
demand taking a hit. The carrier fears that its UK shareholders will be treated as non-EU. We note that Mar 29, 
2019 is the date for the UK to leave the EU. In the event of the scenario materializing, Ryanair's licencing and flight 
rights might be hurt. Under the current ownership rules an EU airline must have more than 50% EU ownership. 
However, Ryanair would fall short of the requisite numbers if the UK indeed exits the EU. Ryanair also fears that the 
Open Skies agreement might not be operational after 2020.In addition, rising fuel costs are anticipated to limit 
bottom-line growth. Ryanair expects its fuel bill to rise by more than €400m in fiscal 2019 (ending Mar 31, 2019). 
This significant increase is expected to be a major drag on the company's earnings. As the carrier is in talks with 
various labor groups regarding their pay and other factors, labor costs are also anticipated to increase and weigh on 
the bottom line further. Investments on its fleet are also driving up costs. In fiscal 2018, capital expenditures totaled 
€1,470.6 million mainly owing to expenses on fleet upgrade. In fact, unit costs are projected to increase by 9% in 
fiscal 2019 at Ryanair.Other MetricsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 and 2020 earnings moved south 
5.1% and 6.5%, respectively, in the last 30 days. This reflects investor's pessimism surrounding the stock. 
Furthermore, the stock has aVGM Score[2]of C, which highlights its unattractiveness. Here V stands for Value, G 
for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score 
allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in 
mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Undoubtedly, the above 
negatives substantiate the company's Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). In view of the above challenges confronting 
Ryanair, which have led to the unfavorable readings and the bearish Zacks Rank, we believe investors would do 
well to get rid of the stock currently.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broaderTransportation 
sector[3]are Ryder System R[4], Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. EXPD[5] and Norfolk Southern 
Corporation NSC[6]. All these three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's

Jul 12, 2018( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Irish 
budget carrier Ryanair has confirmed it's canceling some 30 flights Thursday after pilots based in Ireland 
announced a 24-hour strike. They want the airline to meet their demands over new working practices.Ryanair said it 
had canceled 30 of its 290 Irish flights on Thursday as a result of a strike announced by the Irish Airline Pilots' 
Association last week.The company said the disruption was limited to high-frequency British-Irish routes, but 
warned that knock-on effects could not be ruled out.Pilots directly employed by Ryanair and who are members of its 
Irish trade union voted to go on strike for the first time after the union said last week the budget carrier had failed to 
meet demands over new working practices.Irish pilots had said they wanted a better negotiated deal with regard to 
wages, the allocation of base transfers, promotions and annual leave.Stalled talks"These coordinated strike threats 
are designed to cause unnecessary disruption to customers and damage Ryanair's low-fare model, for the benefit 
of high-fare competitor airlines in Ireland and Germany," Ryanair said in a statement.Ryanair executives fear that 
further strike action may hit the airline in Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece and France later in the summer holiday 
season.The Irish no-frills carrier was in deep trouble last year when it had to cancel hundreds of flights over 
insufficient crew caused by rostering failures. 
There were massive complaints by staff about working conditions at the airline.hg/jd (Reuters, EFE)

Jul 12, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
plcRYAAY[1] could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the 
moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for RYAAY broke out below the 200 Day 
Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has 
moved lower by 4.9% in the past four weeks. 
And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for 
RYAAY stock.If that wasn't enough, Ryanair Holdings isn't looking too great from an earnings estimate revision 
perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the 
stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 1 estimate has 
been reduced, while none has moved higher. Add this into a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and 
there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) on this 
stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship 
until the estimates and technical factors turn around for RYAAY. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 
Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[2].The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global 
revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will 
produce "the world's first trillionaires," but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the 
right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>[3]Want the latest recommendations from Zacks

Jul 11, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, key 
airline players like SkyWest Inc. SKYW[1], Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[2] and Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[3] 
unveiled their respective traffic numbers for June. Impressively, all the three reports showed increase in load factor 
(% of seats filled by passengers) as traffic growth outweighed capacity expansion. Alaska Air Group, Inc.'s ALK[4] 
subsidiary, Alaska Airlines, also featured in the headlines by virtue of its expansion-related update. 
Meanwhile, JetBlue Airways Corporation JBLU[5] took a significant step toward upgrading its fleet and improving 
the flying experience of its passengers, when it placed an order for 60 Airbus A220-300 planes (previously known 
as Bombardier CS300). The new, more efficient planes are scheduled to be delivered to JetBlue in the 2020-2025 
timeframe. JetBlue has the option of buying 60 more planes from Airbus from 2025 onward.(Read the lastAirline

in block hours (a measure of aircraft utilization) to 149,300 in June 2018. The regional carrier, which remains 
focused on streamlining its operations, stated that the fall in the metric was in sync with its fleet transition plans. The 
company intends to reduce the 50-seat jets in its fleet and add new E175 aircraft (read more: SkyWest's June Block 
Hours Decline, Load Factor Up[8]).3. At Allegiant, June traffic (for the total system) increased 9.5% and capacity 
expanded 8.8%. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, load factor inched up 60 basis points year over 
year to 85.2%. Allegiant's passenger count rose 11% in the month (read more: Allegiant's Traffic ...ad Factor

passenger kilometers (RPK) — increased 4.6% to 2.81 billion. While domestic RPK rose 6.7%, international RPK 
plunged 16.6%. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat kilometers/ASKs) expanded 
4.7% to 3.61 billion. Domestic ASK ascended 5.9%, while international ASK slid 5.8%. The carrier expects 
operating margin between 1% and 1.5% in the second quarter of 2018, flat year over year. EBITDA margin is

modernize its fleet, JetBlue has agreed to buy at least 60 A220-300 jets from Airbus. This multi-billion dollar deal 
further strengthens the carrier's association with Airbus. Following the arrival of the new jets, JetBlue plans to do 
away with its existing fleet of Embraer E-190 planes in the 2020-2025 timeframe. Per the agreement, JetBlue has 
also agreed to convert its order for 25 A320neos to A321neos, which are comparatively bigger.7. At United

Google+ Share on LinkedInRyanair cabin crews in Italy, Portugal, Spain and Belgium have announced a 24-hour 
strike on 25-26 July. Another strike on Thursday, July 12 should mostly affect passengers travelling from Ireland. 
The company dismisses the industrial action as 'blackmail'; until December 2017, the Irish company did engage 
with unions and refused collective bargaining. There are now a number of European unions representing cabin 
crews, including Belgium's CNE/LBC, Spain's SITCPLA and USO, Portugal's SNPVAC and Italy's Ultrasporti. In a 
joint statement, the unions claim that Ryanair is practising 'social dumping' and does not abide by EU member 
states employment regulation. Ryanair is the biggest budget airline in Europe, servicing over 130 million 
passengers and 37 countries in 2017. The latest industrial actions is spearheaded by crews that want to be paid 
their salaries in their home country rather than the Republic of Ireland. Unions make clear that further action should 
be expected if Ryanair does not take onboard some of their demands. Ryanair's Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson 
claims that the strike does not have a 'democratic mandate' as it is opposed by the overwhelming majority of Irish 
pilots, the public broadcaster RT News reports. The Irish pilots' union (IALPA) supports the strike, although Ryanair 
claims that only 27% of its own pilots are behind industrial action. However, 94 out of its 95 Ryanair pilots voted in 
support of industrial action. Ryanair will issue an update notice to passengers on Tuesday, when it is clear which 
flights it can cover with volunteer crews and pilots. The strike comes in peak tourist season, following repeated 
strikes by air traffic controllers across Europe in June. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+

Jul 06, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[1] reported impressive traffic figures for June owing to low air fares. Notably, traffic increased 7% year over 
year to 12.6 million in the month. In fact, the passenger count in June was the highest so far (April, May and June) 
at Ryanair in fiscal 2019. Passenger count in April and May were 12.3 million and 12.5 million, respectively. 
We note that Ryanair's fiscal year ends on Mar 31.Coming back to the June traffic report, load factor (% of seats 
filled by passengers) came in at an impressive 96% buoyed by strong demand for air travel. The metric improved 
from the May 2018 reading of 95%. However, load factor was flat on a year-over-year basis.The impressive June 
traffic report provides some relief to this European low-cost carrier, which has been struggling with labor-related 
issues for quite some time. Ryanair's pilots, based in Ireland, are scheduled to go on a 24-hour strike on Jul 12 in 
protest against management's approach toward transfers between the carrier's European and African bases. The 
strike, if it materializes, might hamper travel plans of many passengers as Jul 12 marks the beginning of the 
traditional holiday fortnight in Northern Ireland.Adding to its woes, Ryanair 's cabin staff in Belgium, Italy, Portugal 
and Spain will go on strike on Jul 25 and 26 against management inaction as far as their demands pertaining to 
higher pay and better working conditions are concerned. What is worse is that more strikes may follow if the labor 
unrest is not resolved.The ongoing labor problems have been responsible for the 8.4% decline in the Ryanair stock 
over the last three months.Three-Month Price PerformanceZacks Rank ...ocks to ConsiderRyanair has a Zacks 
Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the in the broaderTransportation sector[2]are GATX Corporation GATX[3], 
Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC[4] and CSX Corporation CSX[5]. All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6].Shares of GATX, Norfolk 
Southern and CSX have rallied 14.7%, 18.7% and 18.3%, respectively, over the last three months.Will You Make a 
Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, 
lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles 
(EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery 
prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according 
to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>[7]Want the latest recommendations from

From there I move on to the latest case law from the Court of Justice of the European Union and then return to the 
UK for some developments on the now infamous Windrush cases. 
Then there are some new cases in the rather different areas of business and asylum and the usual dry but vital 
procedural changes. If you would like to claim CPD points for reading the material and listening to this podcast,sign

Jul 05, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
Southwest Airlines Co. LUV[1] received good news on the labor front. The low-cost carrier inked a provisional labor 
deal with the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association. Notably, the association represents 2,400 of its employees 
involved in the aircraft mechanics workgroup.However, labor troubles continue at European low-cost carrier, 
Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[2]. The airline pilots, based in Ireland, are scheduled to go on a 24-hour strike on Jul 
12 in protest against management's approach toward transfers between the carrier's European and African 
bases.Meanwhile, June load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) at Delta Air Lines, Inc. 
DAL[3] remained flat at 88.5% as both traffic and capacity grew at 3% each, during the month. An expansion-
related update from Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.'s HA[4] subsidiary, Hawaiian Airlines, also grabbed headlines over the 
past five trading days.(Read the lastAirline Stock Roundup for Jun 27, 2018[5])Recap of the Past Week's Most 
Important Stories 1. Apart from the tentative labor deal[6] with its aircraft mechanics, Southwest Airlines, which is 
undergoing turbulence due to the Flight 1380 accident earlier this year, was in the news again when it extended its 
bookable schedule through Mar 6, 2019. As part of its domestic expansion initiatives, the low-cost carrier 
announced several additional non-stop services connecting North Texas with important cities across the United 
States. It will also increased frequency to the popular destinations from Dallas Love Field (read more: Southwest to 
Add Flights for Domestic Expansion[7]).2. While releasing its June traffic numbers, Delta stated that it still expects 
second-quarter earnings per share in the $1.65-$1.75 range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 
earnings stands at $1.75 per share. Adjusted pre-tax margin is still anticipated in the band of 13-14% for the same 
period. Also, fuel price per gallon is projected to be between $2.20 and $2.25. System capacity is envisioned to 
expand approximately 3.5%. Additionally, total revenue per available seat mile is expected (TRASM) to increase 
between 4% and 5% year over year.Delta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's 
Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[8].3. Hawaiian Airlines has announced a daily non-stop service between 
Sacramento, CA and Kahului, Maui. While flights between Kahului and Sacramento will start operating from Apr 1, 
2019, the same between Sacramento and Kahului will begin the next day. Tickets are currently on sale with special 
introductory one-way fares (read more: Hawaiian Holdings Arm to Fly Sacramento-Kahului From 2019[9]).4. 
Ryanair's pilots, represented by the Irish Airline Pilots' Association and directly employed by the company, will go 
on strike next Thursday against management inaction as far as their demands are concerned. The strike, if it 
materializes, might hamper travel plans of many passengers as Jul 12 marks the beginning of the traditional holiday 
fortnight in Northern Ireland. What is worse is that more strikes may follow if the labor unrest is not resolved.5. 
Despite rising fuel costs, average air fares continue to drop in the United States. The metric declined 6.6% year 
Airline Stock Roundup: LUV's Labor Deal, DAL 's June Traffic Report More
over year in June mainly due to intense competition in key markets. Moreover, air fares in the country are projected 
to be down 9% year over year for travel on Jul 4, 2018. The figure of $171[10] round-trip is projected to be the 
lowest since Jul 4, 2013. Although favorable for passengers, low air fares are a drag for airline companies.Price 
Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the last week and 
during the past six months.The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the green over the last week 
leading to a 1.2% increase in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index. Over the course of six months, the sector tracker has 
decreased 14.6% due to multiple headwinds like rising fuel costs. Shares of GOL Linhas Areas Inteligentes S.A. 
GOL[11] have declined the most (44.8%) in the period.What's Next in the Airline Space?Investors will look forward 
to June traffic reports from the likes of United Continental Holdings, Inc. UAL[12] and Allegiant Travel Company 
ALGT[13] in the coming days.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at 
Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, 
+109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over 
the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these 
strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to

Jul 04, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per a Bloomberg[1] 
report, Ryanair Holdings PLC RYAAY[2] will encounter its first-ever pilot strike next week in the home market of 
Ireland over its alleged failure to meet demands regarding new working practices.The Irish Air Line Pilots' 
Association (IALPA) representing Ryanair pilots stated that a polling by the carrier's cockpit crew members resulted 
in a 94 to 1 vote in favor of industrial action including strikes. The walkouts are scheduled to be staged on Jul 12. 
The strike is expected to carry on for 24 hours and the IALPA will notify the airline regarding additional walkouts. 
However, the union is open to discussions to resolve the issue.The carrier was able to avert similar strikes last 
December, acknowledging trade unions for the very first time in its 32 years in the industry. 
However, the airline has been unable to reach a definitive agreement in some countries.With Ireland accounting for 
only 7% of Ryanair flights, majority of its customers is expected to be unaffected by this strike. However, the timing 
of the strike cannot be ignored. The turmoil comes at a time when the airline's summer travel is already pressurized 
with last month's cancellation of 1,100 flights due to air traffic control strikes, among other factors. Moreover, 
traditional holidays in Northern Ireland start from Jul 12 onward. Thus, the strike is likely to adversely impact 
travelers 
holidaying 
to 
Dublin 
during 
the 
time.Ryanair 
Holdings 
PLC 
Price 
https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/fundamental/priceRyanair Holdings PLC Price[3] | Ryanair Holdings 
PLC Quote[4] The union has also warned of a ripple effect arising from the strike at Ireland, which could affect 
flights elsewhere.Earlier, Ryanair successfully signed agreements with the cabin crew in Britain and Italy. However, 
some of them will come together in Dublin on Jul 11 in their first pan-European summit to negotiate contract 
terms.In a similar vein, German pilots are involved in a dispute with the airline over remuneration and work 
environment related problems. Final result of the ongoing voting process is due this month-end.Zacks Rank ...y

Jul 02, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Amazon's AMZN[1] cloud 
computing arm Amazon Web Services ('AWS') continues to fortify market share in the cloud industry driven by 
improving clientele. This can be attributed to its innovative cloud products and services. Moreover, the offering of 
special discounts on long-term deals and advanced payments also help the company in attracting 
customers.Recently, the company's AWS solutions were selected by Formula One Group (Formula 1). This 
highlights the power and reliability of AWS services.Per the deal, Formula 1 has opted for services such as Amazon 
SageMaker, AWS Lambda, AWS Elemental Media Services and AWS analytics services on AWS platform to 
leverage the machine learning and data analytics capabilities of these services.These services will help Formula 1 
to improvise business operations like data tracking systems, race strategies, video asset workflows and digital 
broadcasts.With the help of Amazon SageMaker, Formula 1's data scientists will be able to enhance their race 
predictions by extracting race performance statistics. Further, AWS Elemental Media Services will give a better 
visual experience to the viewers worldwide.Rising AWS AdoptionAmazon's strong focus toward improvement of its 
service portfolio will continue to add strength to customer base. 
Moreover, it will aid the company in sustaining its dominant position in the cloud market which holds immense 
potential and reap benefits from it.Per a Gartner report, the global market for public cloud services is expected to 
grow 21.4% in 2018 from 2017 to exhibit revenues of $186.4 billion. Further, the revenues are expected to hit 
$302.5 billion in 2021 from $153.5 in 2017.We note that the company is well poised to reap benefits from this 
rapidly growing market with the aid of its well performing AWS, which generated $5.44 billion revenues in the last 
quarter and improved 48.6% on a year-over-year basis. This was primarily due to its strong customer base and 
reliable services.AWS has won quite a number of clients within a two months time frame. The latest being Formula 
1. Few days back, zulily, an online retailer, also selected AWS and moved its majority of workloads to AWS.In May, 
the company's services were selected by three clients namely Verizon, Oath and Ryanair. All three of these 
companies have moved their infrastructure to AWS.In April, Shutterfly also moved its infrastructure to AWS. 
Additionally, companies like GoDaddy, Cox Automotive, NextGen Healthcare, Amway, LG Electronics selected 
AWS during the first quarter. Notably, AWS customer base totaled 10K till the first quarter.We believe improving 
adoption rate of AWS will continue to drive Amazon's top-line growth and improve its market position.Amazon.com, 
Inc. Revenue (TTM) https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/AMZN/fundamental/revenue-ttm Amazon.com, Inc. 
Revenue (TTM)[2] | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote[3]Improving CompetitionAmazon's continuous efforts to improve its 
offerings will continue to help it gaining momentum in the market.The company has teamed up with Kaleido, a 
provider of blockchain business cloud service. The partnership will help the AWS customers to manage their 
Amazon ( AMZN ) Improves Client Base With Formula 1 Deal
blockchain projects at a higher speed.Additionally, the company has recently announced the general availability of 
Amazon Neptune and Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes.Driven by these endeavors, the company 
is likely to continue leading the cloud market and strengthening its competitive position against the likes of 
Microsoft's MSFT[4] Azure, Alphabet's GOOGL[5] Google Cloud and Alibaba's BABA[6] cloud platform.Per Synergy 
Research, AWS maintained its dominance in the cloud infrastructure services market and acquired 33% in the last 
quarter. Microsoft, Google and Alibaba gained share from small-to-medium sized cloud operators.Notably, shares 
of Amazon have returned 45.4% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry[7]'s rally of 22.9%.Currently, 
Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)

Jun 25, 2018( ACTmedia News: http://actmedia.eu Delivered by Newstex)  Wizz Air, Tarom and Ryanair are air 
companies with the fewest delays in Romania, according to the annual classification of the best companies and 
airports in the world, made by AirHelp and released on Tuesday. Otopeni Airport is the only Romanian airport 
ranking 116th in the top, out of 141 companies. AirHelp, a company specialised in obtaining compensations for 
delayed, cancelled or overbooked flights, published the annual classification of the best air companies and airports 
at global level (AirHelp Score). The document shows that Wizz Air, Tarom and Ryanair are the best air companies 
and Otopeni Airport is the only one in the world top. 
'AirHelp Score, the most complete and precise evaluation in the market, analysed 72 world air companies and 141 
airports, according to three important criteria: punctuality (in time arrivals and departures), quality of company 
services aboard airplanes and in airports and processing compensation demands for delayed flights and 
passengers' experience in airports', AirHelp representatives say. The study shows that over the analysed period, 
17.22% of WizzAir flights had delays (0.58% of flights had delays of more than 3 hours), 29.33% of Tarom flights 
were delayed (0.92% more than 3 hours). Tarom routes with more problems were London-Bucharest, Alicante-
Bucharest, Iasi-Madrid and Nice-Bucharest. 'Wizz Air recorded most points for all evaluation criteria. At global lebel, 
Wizz Air ranks 13th, before companies like Turkish Airlines (15th), Emirates (16th) or British Airways (21st),' AirHelp 
shows. The classification also shows that Tarom recorded a score of 7.31, ranking 49th of 72 in the world top, 
before companies like Thomas Cook Airlines, Aeroflot Russian Airlines or Tap Portugal. The top for Romania is 
completed by Ryanair, which is one of the lowest ranking air companies in Europe, next to Iberia and Easyjet. 
'Following the evaluatin of the 72 world air companies, Qatar Airways ranks first, followed by Lufthansa and Etihad 
Airways. The delays top is completed by Singapore Airlines, South African Airways, Austrian Airlines, Aegean 
Airlines, Qantas, Air Malta and Virgin Atlantic. Four of them (Austrian Airlines, Aegean Airlines, Air Malta and Virgin 
Atlantic) are European companies,' according to the study. AirHelp shows that the last five places are occupied by 
Air Mauritius, Easyjet, Pakistan International Airlines, Royal Jordanian Airlines and WOW Air (Iceland). 'At the same 
time, AirHelp evaluated many airports on all continents, considering flight punctuality, service quality and 
passengers' experience at terminals. The best airport with 8.77 points is Hamad International Airport of Doha, 
Qatar, followed by Athens International Airport (8.69) and Haneda Airport, Tokyo (8.63), while Henri Coanda Airport 
Bucharest is the only Romanian airport in the top, ranking 116th out of 141', the study shows. AirHelp 
representatives point out that the period of time analysed was December 22, 2017- March 20, 2018. The top for air 
companies took into account delays and cancellations of flights as well as passenger reviews. 'Flight punctuality 
meant 33.33% of overall score (the number of flights that reached destination in time out of total flights) as well as 
Wizz Air, Tarom and Ryanair, companies with fewest delays in Romania
the quality of services offered, processing damage applications (for helpful an air company is, how quickly they 
process demands and compensate passengers)', the AirHelp release shows. In case of airports, flight punctuality 
and the quality of services offered meant 45% of total score, while passenger reviews in social media was only 
10%. AirHelp aids passengers obtain compensations up to 600 euro, in case the flight was cancelled or had delays 
of at least three hours because of the air company, including spontaneous crew strikes, the exact amount being 
calculated according to flight distance. Passengers can apply retroactively for compensations, up to three years 
after the affected flight.

Jun 18, 2018( Kerry Underwood: http://kerryunderwood.wordpress.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  InBott ... Solicitors 
Ltd v Ryanair DAC [2018] EWHC 534 (Ch)[1] the High Court refused to grant Bott ... Solicitors equitable relief to 
protect its lien for costs in relation to flight delay compensation obtained from Ryanair. The judgment helpfully distils 
numerous authorities considering the circumstances in which the court will intervene on equitable grounds to 
protect a solicitor's lien. Notably, the court distinguished this case from Gavin Edmondson Solicitors Ltd v Haven 
Insurance Company Ltd [2015] EWCA Civ 1230[2] which is under appeal to the Supreme Court. 
Ryanair had started to settle pre-action flight delay compensation claims directly with Bott ...'s clients. Bott ... 
therefore lost the opportunity to deduct its fees from the clients' compensation. Bott ... requested that Ryanair 
undertake to preserve Bott ...'s lien over any claim proceeds in accordance with Khans Solicitors v Chifuntwe [2013] 
EWCA Civ 481[3] which held that equity will intervene to protect a solicitor's claim on funds recovered or due to be 
recovered by a client or former client, where the paying party has notice of the receiving party's solicitor's claim. 
When Ryanair refused to do so, the claimant issued proceedings for relief, including an indemnity in respect of fees 
where Bott ... S had submitted a compensation claim to Ryanair on behalf of a client, and where Ryanair had paid 
the client directly, and the client had not settled Bott ...'s fees. Having reviewed the authorities pre-dating Gavin 
Edmondson, the court held that, in order for a solicitor to have an equitable lien in relation to property recovered or 
preserved, the following criteria must be fulfilled: '(i) There must be a fund in sight; (ii) recovered, preserved or 
established by the solicitor's efforts or activity; (iii) as a result of litigation or arbitration, including a compromise 
resulting from the pressure of litigation or arbitration between the solicitor's client and the other party, (iv) in which 
the solicitor has an interest that equity can protect and which is deserving of protection.' A question arose as to the 
extent to which Gavin Edmondson had extended the third criterion. The court observed that the justification for 
extending the Khans principle to Gavin Edmondson appeared to be that Edmondson's clients, through its efforts, 
had participated in a voluntary but formalised scheme under the RTA Protocol, sanctioned by the judiciary, for the 
early resolution of claims involving personal injury, which, once the defendant insurers engaged with the relevant 
claims, gave rise to an entitlement to fixed costs under CPR 45. The present case was 'quite different' as there was 
no such scheme for the early resolution of flight delay compensation claims, much less one giving Bott ... Solicitors 
an entitlement to costs under the CPR. Consequently, there was 'no principled basis' for extending to this case the 
protective principle exemplified in Khans and Gavin Edmondson. Comment  This case has major implications for 
those solicitors faced with correspondence from the likes of JG and Checkmylegalfees. If solicitors feel that there 
may potentially be small sums due to the lay client, then they can send that small sum to the lay client without any 
lien based liability for the new solicitors' cost. Any such costs would then be a matter between those new solicitors 
COURT REFUSES TO GRANT SOLICITOR LIEN FOR COSTS
and the lay client. Such cases clearly fall on the Bott ... side of the line, and not the Gavin Edmondson side of the 
line.

Robertson was recently interviewed by CNBC. Here's a summary and the full video below:- When asked about Paul 
Tudor Jones' recent comments[1] about stocks heading higher into year-end, Robertson said that, "I think there's a 
very good chance of that happening (in the next year) and I'm positioned accordingly."- He thinks it's possible that 
interest rates go up so high so fast that the Fed would have to ease up a bit. 
But doesn't think rates will go 'wildly' up- Says the President has done a reasonably good job, but could do with a 
dose of humility- Tax cuts have helped corporate earnings but also the earnings of the middle class tremendously- 
Feels a slowdown is at least 6 months and 'hopefully' 2 years away- Tech stocks: he doesn't think FANG stocks are 
frothy at all, especially relative to the rest of the market. This is one area where he feels he differs in opinion from a 
lot of market participants. Adds Microsoft (MSFT) to that bunch as these stocks have growth rates similar to their 
multiples- He likes the management at many of these companies, Facebook etc- Air Canada at 3x next year's 
cashflow is not an expensive stock and is 'beautifully run'. Also likes Ryanair in Europe. Doesn't really have any 
airline favorites in the US right now- Loves the banks, thinks they're very reasonably priced in relation to earnings. 
Huge cashflow yields next year and thereafter. Thinks they're in terrific shape, likes JPMorgan (JPM) and Bank of 
America (BAC)- Would tell grandchildren to own FB, BAC, JPM, probably Citigroup (C), which is 'reasonably 
priced'Embedded

Jun 12, 2018( The Today File: http://blogs.seattletimes.com/today/ Delivered by Newstex)  Online flash-sale retailer 
Zulily says it has nearly finished putting the bulk of the software it uses to run its business on the cloud-computing 
infrastructure of Amazon Web Services. The announcement — the latest in a series by AWS meant to tout its 
momentum, as the leader in rented computing power and software services tries to fend off rivals Microsoft and 
Google — reads like many prior examples, including Ryanair, Shutterfly, and Cox Automotive.But Zulily's move 
stands out because the company, which sells items from baby clothes to perfume in daily flash sales, competes 
directly with Amazon's core online retail businesses. There are reasons some companies are cautious about such a 
move. 
Most Read Business Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1]Large retailers like Target[2] and Kroger[3] 
are said to be avoiding Amazon's cloud. AWS is already the Seattle company's most profitable business unit. Why 
spend money to help a rival? Some caution that running software on Amazon's servers runs the risk of tipping off 
the company's retail groups to trends or other insight that might give them a competitive advantage. So what does 
Zulily think about putting its critical business information in the hands of the dreaded Amazon? 'We're not,' said 
Luke Friang, Zulily's chief information officer. 'We're putting it on AWS's servers. So we don't see it that 
way.'Amazon says it largely runs AWS as a separate business, with its own chief executive and separate 
technology and sales teams. To land customers, AWS executives guarantee that they don't examine corporate 
records and other sensitive information stored on their servers. 'I would lie if I said the question didn't came up,' 
Friang said. But AWS allayed those concerns for him years ago, he said. When Zulily started its search for a cloud-
computing provider last year, 'we didn't even think about it.' Increasingly, companies of all sizes are turning to[4] 
giant cloud-computing providers to run their software. The efficiency of giant server farms working for many 
customers at once can make the option less expensive than owning and operating a corporate data center, and 
rented computer power from the likes of Amazon can ramp up and down quickly without wasting resources during 
down time.That flexibility has long been a consideration for Zulily, which launches sales each morning that it 
broadcasts to its users, a process that requires sudden, intensive software use.Most of the software Zulily uses was 
built in-house, Friang said, including the tools that catalog and store product photos, and inventory and customer 
tracking programs. The company, founded in 2009 and purchased in 2015[5] by home-shopping giant QVC, has 
long run those programs from servers operated by other companies instead of its own.'Just about everything that's 
critical to the business is technology that we build,' said Friang, who, prior to joining Seattle-based Zuiliy worked for 
Drugstore.com and Costco Wholesale's e-commerce business. Last year, the company decided to centralize most 
Online retailer Zulily picks Amazon , an e-commerce rival, for cloud-computing deal
of its services, previously split between Rackspace and Google Cloud Platform, onto a single provider, kicking off a 
search that included consideration of AWS, by far the market leader in cloud-computing services, as well as 
Microsoft and Google. Amazon, he said, offered the widest variety of services, and the most useful tools. Zulily 
started moving applications to AWS in September, and aim to wrap up the transition later this month. Zulily won't be 
an exclusive Amazon shop. The company runs Microsoft's Office 365, the cloud-based variant of its productivity 
suite, and will continue to use Google Cloud Platform for some data services and analysis and prediction tools.But 
the move to AWS had caused Friang to start using some Amazon services, including security software, that he 
hadn't considered using previously.'We are going to be exploring quite a bit over the next six months or so,' he said.

Jun 08, 2018( All About Windows Phone: http://allaboutwindowsphone.com Delivered by Newstex)  You may 
remember that Ireviewed PAWA here[1]and thenreported on one update[2]after another recently[3]? And then one 
more[4]. Well, it's updated yet again, and I make no apologies for covering this really interesting tool, here here with 
options to better handle the resulting web experience. In case you'd been living under a rock, PAWA lets you add 
packaged PWAs (Progressive Web Applications) to your Start screen, so that they launch and run without Edge 
browser furniture.As before, the support for multiple packaged sites/apps means, for example, you can have 
Ryanair Rooms in one instance, Google Maps Go in another, and the Financial Times in yet another. 
All accessed from your Start screen and thereafter from the multitasking carousel in Windows 10 Mobile. Previous 
versions of PAWA had the possible downside that tapping the Start tile if there were already an instance of that 
site/PWA running would start another, leading to confusion and RAM wastage, but the developer - perhaps as an 
experiment - has now made it so that tapping on a PAWA tile when that PWA is already in RAM seems to close that 
instance, i.e. you have control. Then tapping again starts a new instance. If this is official behaviour now then I'd like 
to see it documented! New for v1.2.4, over and above the previously reported v1.2.2[5] are: New CommandBar 
(New options will appear here in future) Fullscreen Toggle in CommandBar Toggle to make Progress Indicator 
Optional @ Dashboard Toggle to make CommandBar Optional @ Dashboard Fixed Certain Scrolling Issues 
PageCache Enabled (Scroll Positions of previous pages should be in memory as much as the memory can handle) 
Fixed ProgressBar Not Stopping Progress Indicator on Top (If its too small let me know) True Fullscreen on Web 
Videos. (the Taskbar /Navbar are hidden properly) Here's the new version in action:Setting up a new Start tile 
'instance' in the usual way - name, URL, icon; (right) new toggles control the optional command bar and progress 
indicators.For efficient PWAs, the loading time is so short that you don't really get a chance to see progress 
indicators, but look at the top of the screen here to see familiar scrolling dots. Plus there's a black (slim) command 
bar at the bottom, with '...' and this expands as you'd expect. The command bar expands to just have 'Fullscreen' at 
the moment - somewhat pointless since you were the one who asked for the command bar in the Dashboard in the 
first place! But the facility is there in order that the developer can put in extra web aids - you can already see two 
more command controls greyed out: Render Type and Default Browser. So it seems that there's plenty more to 
come from PAWA's developer.You cangrab PAWA in the Store here[6]. This is a great addition to Windows 10 
Mobile, especially as there are now so many HTML5 sites and PWAs taking the place, in many cases, of native 
WP8.1 or UWP applications. Yes, some are now being bundled in the Store as standalone installs, but most aren't 
and 
it's 
here 
that 
PAWA 
steps 
in.

ReleaseChicago, IL - June 7, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day 
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. 
Stocks recently featured in the blog include Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL[1], Southwest Airlines Co. 
LUV[2], JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU[3], American Airlines Group Inc. AAL[4] and Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[5].Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free[6]. 
Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst Blog:Airline Stock Roundup: IAIA, LUV, DAL ...reThe past week was 
dominated by updates from the International Air Transport Association ('IATA'). The monthly data released by the 
IATA showcased a 6.2% year-over-year increase in demand for air travel across the globe for April 2018.Another 
significant update from the trade association emerged recently, when it trimmed its 2018 profitability outlook for the 
airline industry to $33.8 billion from $38.4 billion anticipated earlier. Notably, high fuel costs were primarily 
responsible for the view cut. Bulk of the global profits ($15 billion) are expected to come from the North American 
region.The IATA updates apart, the Atlanta, GA-based airline behemoth Delta Air Lines, Inc. was in the news by 
virtue of its May traffic report. In the month, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) declined as traffic growth 
was outpaced by capacity expansion.Meanwhile, Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co. continues to feel the pinch of 
the deadly accident on its flight in April, which claimed one life. Due to low ticket sales as a result of the accident 
apart from the spike in oil prices, this low-cost carrier issued a second-quarter unit revenue view, which was at the 
lower end of its previous forecast. Operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) is anticipated to decline 
around 3% year over year (the earlier guidance had called for a decline in the 1-3% range).Furthermore, JetBlue 
Airways Corp. joined fellow-carriers like American Airlines Group Inc. in revamping its policy pertaining to emotional 
support animals on its flights.Transportation - Airline Industry 5YR % Return[7](Read the last Airline Stock Roundup 
for May 30, 2018[8]).Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. At its 74th Annual General Meeting in 
Sydney, Australia, the IATA stated that due to rising fuel costs and other factors like the ongoing geopolitical 
tensions, airline companies are expected to be less profitable in 2018 than previously anticipated. Global net profit 
margin is expected to contract to 4.1% in 2018 from 5% a year ago. However, the top line is projected to increase 
10.7% on the back of higher passenger and cargo revenues.Even though, passenger air travel growth in 2018 (7%) 
is anticipated to be slower than the phenomenal 8.1% growth witnessed last year, it compares favorably to the 20-
year average growth rate (Read more: IATA Trims 2018 Airlines Profit Forecast Due to High Costs[9]).Earlier in the 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Delta Air Lines , Southwest Airlines , JetBlue Airways , American Airlines 
Group and Ryanair Holdings
week, IATA also released its global traffic numbers for April. Although global travel demand (measured in revenue 
passenger kilometers or RPKs) increased year over year, the metric compared unfavorably to the March reading 
when traffic expanded 9.7% — the highest growth rate in 12 months. With fuel costs on the rise, air fares are likely 
to increase in the remainder of the year.On a year-over-year basis, traffic growth was evident in both international 
(4.8%) and domestic (8.5%) markets, which resulted in a rise in the overall figure. Total capacity ((available seat 
kilometers or ASKs) increased 5.9% in the month. Load factor also improved 20 basis points to 82.3% owing to 
higher traffic growth. In fact, the reading on load factor was a record as far as the month of April was concerned.2. 
At Delta, consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), came in at 19.69 billion, up 2.9% year 
over year. Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) climbed 3.5% to 22.83 billion on a year-over-year 
basis (Read more: Delta May Traffic Shows a Rise, Load Factor Drops[10]).Meanwhile, Delta and Korean Air 
extended their codeshare agreement on flights in the United States as both the companies aim to boost traffic in the 
highly lucrative trans-Pacific market. This customer-friendly move followed the launch of a joint venture partnership 
between the two earlier this year. A codeshare deal allows sharing of flights, which implies that a passenger has the 
free will to avail any flight operated by either of the companies under the agreement, irrespective of the flight 
number.Delta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, you can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank 
(Strong Buy) stocks here[11].3. Southwest Airlines trimmed its capacity outlooks for second-quarter and full-year 
2018 due to increasing fuel prices. The company now anticipates second-quarter available seat mile (ASM) or 
capacity to rise approximately 3.5%. Earlier, it had called for 3.5-4% growth in the metric. Also, for the latter half of 
the year, ASM is anticipated to expand approximately 6% year over year, lower than its earlier view of a rise in the 
low 7% range (read more: Southwest Trims View on Soft Bookings ...ike in Oil Prices[12]).4. Ireland-based Ryanair 
Holdings plc reported solid traffic data for May, courtesy of low air ticket prices. The carrier's traffic improved 6% 
year over year in the month. Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) rose to 96% from 95% a year 
ago on the back of decline in air ticket prices. The impressive traffic figures came despite the carrier having to 
cancel more than 1,100 flights in May due to staff shortages, inclement weather and other factors.5. From Jul 1, 
passengers will only be allowed to carry cats, dogs and miniature horses as emotional support animals on JetBlue 
flights. As part of tightening its policy, this low-cost carrier will ask the relevant passengers to provide extensive 
documentation pertaining to the animal's health and behavior.In addition, the person has to provide proof related to 
its vaccinations and other factors within 48 hours before the flight. Under the stricter rules, the concerned 
passenger will also have to sign a document taking full responsibility for any injury caused by the animal he/she is 
carrying on the flight.Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1 Stock of the Day pick for

Jun 05, 2018( All About Windows Phone: http://allaboutwindowsphone.com Delivered by Newstex)  Another day, 
another useful little PWA (Progressive Web App) that runs very well under Windows 10 Mobile, with just a hint of 
cosmetic confusion here and there. As usual, you can package this for use without an Edge URL bar by using 
PAWA[1] or similar. 
Or just wait until Microsoft puts this officially in the Store?You can run this new PWA app by going 
torooms.ryanair.com[2]in the Edge browser and then go from there. Here's the PWA in action:It's a web page, no, 
it's an application - blurring the lines very nicely is this PWA, with slick form filling, auto-fill, hamburger menu for 
account, and more... Note the text confusion over the result sort order legend at the top. I've sorted here by 'Lowest' 
(proof below), resulting in these hotel matches for 'London' - the default is all the most profitable and expensive 
hotels. So Ryanair would be taking a cut or profits, methinks....!Here's another small visual stumble, with the pick 
list for sort options only showing one item at a time. It's navigable, though, plus PWAs are, by definition, being fixed 
and patched all the time, server-side, so this should be fixed soon; (right) further filters, all very 'app'-like and a 
pleasure to set up: searching is easy and successful.There's even a 'map' view showing matches and prices - this 
Ryanair PWA is really rather good and it's a definite favourite/pin under Windows 10 Mobile... [ 1]:

IATA Trims 2018 Airlines Profit Forecast Due to High Costs
IATA Trims 2018 Airlines Profit Forecast Due to High Costs
Zacks Investment Research

Jun 04, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  At its Annual General 
Meeting in Sydney, the International Air Transport Association ('IATA') trimmed its forecast for airlines with respect 
to profitability for 2018. The research firm predicts that the global net profit for the industry to be $33.8 billion. This is 
much lower than the 2018 profitability forecast of $38.4 billion, which was unveiled by the organization in December 
2017.The world's leading air transport group has attributed the downward revision of the current-year profitability 
view mainly to the rise in oil prices. Escalating oil prices apart, labor and interest costs have also weighed on the 
profitability forecast.The profitability forecast for the current year also compares unfavorably to what was achieved 
by airlines in 2017 ($38 billion). Moreover, 2017's profitability figure is much higher than the $34.5 billion that was 
projected in December.We note that the 2017 figure of $38 billion was a record for airline companies, boosted by 
one-time items. Due to this reason, IATA believes that the current-year profitability forecast is an impressive one 
despite being lower than the year-ago figure.2018 Forecast in DetailsPer IATA, bulk of the global net profits ($15 
billion) is expected to come from the North American region, which boasts of carriers like Delta Air Lines, Inc. 
DAL[1], United Continental Holdings, Inc. UAL[2], Alaska Air Group, Inc. ALK[3], Southwest Airlines Co. LUV[4] and 
Hawaiian Holdings Inc. HA[5]. The estimated figure is lower than $18.4 billion in 2017. The unfavorable comparison 
is again due to high costs.All the above-mentioned carriers, apart from Southwest, carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
However, you can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[6]European Airlines, 
which includes the likes of Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[7], are expected to be more profitable in 2018 ($8.6 billion) 
than the previous year ($8.1 billion). More extensive hedging by European carriers compared to their North 
American counterparts have made them less vulnerable to the rise in oil prices.Other regions, namely, Asia-Pacific, 
Latin America and the Middle East are expected to generate post-tax net profit of $8.2 billion, $0.9 billion and $1.3 
billion, respectively. African carriers are expected to continue their dismal performance in 2018, suffering losses to 
the tune of $0.1 billion.Global net profit margin is expected to contract to 4.1% in 2018 from 5% a year ago. The top 
line is however projected to increase 10.7% to $834 billion. The top line is likely to be boosted by higher passenger 
as well as cargo revenues. Strong demand for air travel has contributed to the 10.8% year over year growth in 
passenger revenues.Even though, passenger air travel growth in 2018 (7%) is anticipated to be slower than the 
phenomenal 8.1% growth witnessed last year, it compares favorably to the 20-year average growth rate 
(5.5%).Capacity is projected to increase by 6.7% in 2018, flat year over year. According to the forecast, load factor 
(% of seats filled by passengers) for 2016 is expected to expand 20 basis points to 81.7% due to capacity 
expansion being outweighed by traffic growth.Yield and unit costs are projected to increase by 3.8% and 5.8% 
respectively. Unit revenue growth for 2018 is projected at 4.2%. With unit costs anticipated to outpace unit revenue 
IATA Trims 2018 Airlines Profit Forecast Due to High Costs
growth in the current year it is natural for profitability to be hampered.The research firm has also predicted that the 
average net profit per departing passenger would be $7.80 per passenger in 2018 compared with $9.30 in 2017. 
The firm projects that jet fuel prices are likely to escalate around 27.5% to $70 per barrel this year.The expectation 
is also revised upward from $60 a barrel anticipated, while revealing its expectations in December 2017. Fuel bill is 
likely to account for 24.2% of total costs in 2018 (21.4% in 2017).High Fuel Costs Likely to See Uptick in AirfaresIn 
a bid to counter the challenges posed by surging oil prices, airlines are likely to increase air fares. They might pass 
on the increased costs to passengers to prevent profits from being dented.In fact, American Airlines Group Inc.'s 
AAL[8] CEO, Doug Parker, hinted recently in Sydney that air travel might become more expensive in the long-term 
in the event of oil prices remaining high. Some market watchers believe that fuel surcharges may be added to 
tickets. Capacity growth would also probably be subdued in the era of rising prices.Disappointing Price 
PerformanceOil prices have been on an uptrend this year, thanks to various reasons like the geopolitical tensions in 
the Middle East. The struggles of airline stocks chiefly due to surge in oil prices can be gauged from the fact that 
theZacks Airline industry[9] has shed 12.9% of its value so far this year, whereas the S...00 index has gained 2.2% 
in the same period.ConclusionWhat is worse is that oil prices are anticipated to increase further from the current 
level of around $65 a barrel, as envisioned by the IATA. With the organisation trimming airlines profitability forecast 
for the current year mainly due to the upsurge in oil prices, we expect the struggles for airline stocks to continue in 
the remainder of the year.This is likely to result in an uptick in airfares, as mentioned above. However, some market 
watchers believe that this phase of higher fuel costs might promote capacity discipline. This a boon for carriers as 
woes related to capacity overexpansion had plagued airlines for quite some time.With so many possibilities in the 
cards, we expect investors to remain focused on updates from the space as sector participants look to devise ways 
to eliminate threats from rising oil prices.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a 
Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and 
legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early

British meteorologists say up to 20,000 lightning strikes hit the U.K. during a powerful overnight thunderstorm, and a 
London-area airport is reporting flight disruptions after an aircraft refueling system was damaged. London Stansted 
Airport said Sunday that a lightning strike had rendered the fueling system 'unavailable for a period this morning. 
Engineers have been on site and have now restored the system, however flights may still be subject to diversion, 
delay or cancellation.'Britain is in the middle of a long holiday weekend, and budget airline Ryanair couldn't say how 
many of its flights had been affected at the airport, but was offering full refunds to some. Meteorologist Charlie 
Powell said information suggested there were 'somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 strikes across the U.K. 
during the overnight period.'Most Read Business Stories Sale! Get 90% off digital access.[1] [ 1]:

Inc. 
UAL[2], JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU[3],Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[4] and Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL[5].Here are 
highlights from Wednesday's Analyst Blog: Airline Stock Roundup: LUV Ups Dividend, ...reOver the past five 
trading days, there have been quite a few updates in the airline space. Low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co. 
grabbed headlines with an announcement of hike in its quarterly dividend and approval of a new buyback 
plan.Southwest Airlines' investor-friendly updates apart, the past week saw Airlines for America ('A4A') — the 
largest airline trade association in the United States — unveiling a bullish projection for the upcoming summer 
season (Jun 1-Aug 31). The association expects the season will be the busiest one for U.S. carriers in terms of air 
travel.United Continental Holdings, Inc. also featured in the headlines as the chief financial officer (CFO) of its 
subsidiary — United Airlines — decided to step down from his position.. Meanwhile, JetBlue Airways Corp. 
announced the appointment of a new chief operating officer (COO).On the earnings front, European low-cost carrier 
Ryanair Holdings plc reported modest results in fiscal 2018 (ended Mar 31, 2018) and issued a cautious outlook for 
fiscal 2019.Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Southwest Airlines has rewarded shareholders with 
28% dividend hike and a new share repurchase authorization worth $2 billion on the back of impressive results and 
a strong cash flow, arising from huge savings on account of the U.S. tax reform (Read more: Southwest Shares Up 
on Dividend Hike ...w Buyback Program[6]).2. United Airlines appointed Gerry Laderman as the acting CFO, 
following the resignation of Andrew Levy. Levy joined United Airlines in August 2016. (Read more: United 
Continental Unit CFO Andrew Levy Calls it Quits[7]:).3. Delta Air Lines, Inc. announced a new route from New York. 
The carrier will begin non-stop service connecting New York-JFK with Orange County, CA from Oct 15, 2018 
onward. Markedly, this new route adds to the existing 10 daily non-stop flights between JFK and Los Angeles (Read 
more: Delta to Expand in New York With Flights to Orange County[8]).Delta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You

and drive long-term growth, low-cost carrier JetBlue Airways appointed Joanna Geraghty as its president and COO. 
The company intends to announce other management changes in the coming days, with the same

objective.Geraghty, who joined JetBlue in 2005, will oversee the day-to-day airline operations of the carrier and will 
strive to improve its customer service, apart from efficient cost management among other things. She will also 
supervise JetBlue's commercial team. Prior to being appointed as the COO, Geraghty was serving as the carrier's 
executive vice president, customer experience.5. According to a projection by A4A, companies in the airline space 
will make hay in the upcoming summer season. Per the forecast, approximately 246.1 million passengers (2.68 
million fliers per day) will be transported by U.S. airlines this summer, up 3.7% from the 2016 levels.In fact, to meet 
the surge in travel demand, the U.S. carriers are increasing the number of available seats by 116,000 per day. Also, 
with the U.S. economy improving and consumer confidence remaining strong, more Americans are taking 
vacations.Further, declining air fares in addition to a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have 
provided added incentive for consumers to opt for air travel. Driven by the above reasons, the three-month period is 
likely to see 96,000 additional passengers taking to the skies per day on various U.S. carriers.6. Ryanair Holdings 
reported financial and operating numbers with net profit for fiscal 2018 up 10% year over year at €1,450 million 
despite a 3% decline in average airfares. The top line expanded 8% to €7,151 million on the back of a 9% rise in 
traffic to 130 million. Meanwhile, lower costs aided the bottom line. Moreover, load factor came in at 95%.The 
carrier also issued an outlook for fiscal 2019, which was 'on the pessimistic side of cautious' with oil prices rising. 
Unit costs are projected to increase by 9%. Average fares are expected to be flat in fiscal 2019. Traffic is 
anticipated to grow by 9%, with load factor remaining flat. The carrier remains concerned about a Brexit-related 
impact.Media

May 23, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Over the past five 
trading days, there have been quite a few updates in the airline space. Low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co. 
LUV[1] grabbed headlines with an announcement of hike in its quarterly dividend and approval of a new buyback 
plan.Southwest Airlines' investor-friendly updates apart, the past week saw Airlines for America ('A4A') — the 
largest airline trade association in the United States — unveiling a bullish projection for the upcoming summer 
season (Jun 1-Aug 31). The association expects the season will be the busiest one for U.S. carriers in terms of air 
travel.United Continental Holdings, Inc. UAL[2] also featured in the headlines as the chief financial officer (CFO) of 
its subsidiary — United Airlines — decided to step down from his position.. Meanwhile, JetBlue Airways Corp. 
JBLU[3] announced the appointment of a new chief operating officer (COO).On the earnings front, European low-
cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[4] reported modest results in fiscal 2018 (ended Mar 31, 2018) and issued

Stories 1. Southwest Airlines has rewarded shareholders with 28% dividend hike and a new share repurchase 
authorization worth $2 billion on the back of impressive results and a strong cash flow, arising from huge savings on 
account of the U.S. tax reform (Read more: Southwest Shares Up on Dividend Hike ...w Buyback Program[7]).2.

DAL[10] announced a new route from New York. The carrier will begin non-stop service connecting New York-JFK 
with Orange County, CA from Oct 15, 2018 onward. Markedly, this new route adds to the existing 10 daily non-stop

projection by A4A, companies in the airline space will make hay in the upcoming summer season. Per the forecast, 
approximately 246.1 million passengers (2.68 million fliers per day) will be transported by U.S. airlines this summer, 
up 3.7% from the 2016 levels.In fact, to meet the surge in travel demand, the U.S. carriers are increasing the 
number of available seats by 116,000 per day. Also, with the U.S. economy improving and consumer confidence 
remaining strong, more Americans are taking vacations.Further, declining air fares in addition to a much-improved 
job market and rising disposable income have provided added incentive for consumers to opt for air travel. Driven 
by the above reasons, the three-month period is likely to see 96,000 additional passengers taking to the skies per 
day on various U.S. carriers.6. Ryanair Holdings reported financial and operating numbers with net profit for fiscal 
2018 up 10% year over year at €1,450 million despite a 3% decline in average airfares. The top line expanded 8% 
to €7,151 million on the back of a 9% rise in traffic to 130 million. Meanwhile, lower costs aided the bottom line. 
Moreover, load factor came in at 95%.The carrier also issued an outlook for fiscal 2019, which was 'on the 
pessimistic side of cautious' with oil prices rising. Unit costs are projected to increase by 9%. Average fares are 
expected to be flat in fiscal 2019. Traffic is anticipated to grow by 9%, with load factor remaining flat. The carrier 
remains concerned about a Brexit-related impact.Performance The following table shows the price movement of the 
major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.The table above shows that most airline 
stocks traded in the red in the past week leading to the 1.6% decline in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index. Over the last

Images Rising oil prices could lead some smaller airlines to collapse, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary says. "Spot 
prices close to $80 a barrel are going to lead to a significant shakeout in the industry as early as this winter," he 
said. O'Leary spoke after Ryanair reported a 10% profit increase, but warned on future profits.

oil is likely to bring about the demise of numerous low cost airlines with tight profit margins, Michael O'Leary, the 
chief executive of Irish budget airline Ryanair, said. Speaking to Bloomberg TV [1]after his airline issued a profit 
warning for the first time in five years, O'Leary warned that a significant "shake out" is coming in the aviation sector 
as a result of oil's huge surge over the past year or so. "A lot depends on what happens with oil. We're well hedged 
for the next 12 months out to March 2019," O'Leary said. "Spot prices close to $80 a barrel are going to lead to a 
significant shakeout in the industry as early as this winter," he added. "Some of those loss-making airlines who 
couldn't make money when oil was at $40 a barrel certainly can't survive this winter with oil at $80 a barrel." O'Leary 
did not specify any particular airlines he thinks are at risk. Oil passed above the $80 per barrel mark last week[2], as 
a continuing squeeze by the OPEC nations lessens global supply. Saudi Arabia, the de facto head of OPEC is keen 
to increase oil prices as it prepares for the IPO of Saudi Aramco, the kingdom's state oil company. For Aramco, the 
higher the oil price, the more money it can raise from its IPO. O'Leary made the comments as his airline reported a 
10% rise in profits,[3] but warned that a combination of rising wages for staff, aggressive competition to have the 
cheapest fares, and rising oil prices, could dent the company's profitability going forward. "After a strong 2018, with 
profits +10%, the worse outlook is being pinned on rising staff costs, now that it is recognising unions, and falling air 
fares amid fierce price competition, both likely to eat into 2019 profits,"Artjom Hatsaturjants, an analyst with 
Accendo Markets wrote in an email Monday. "With falling fares, control of costs is paramount. It may sound like 
great news that 90% of 2019 fuel needs are hedged at $58/barrel, but higher oil prices are still adding €400M to the 
bill." "And this hedge does nothing to prevent the other newer cost pressure (higher pay for pilots and cabin crew), 
which is projected to add another €200M and other ex-fuel costs +6%," he concluded. Airlines hedge their fuel 
costs, locking in prices far ahead of time to try and mitigate the possibility for rising oil prices in future.  Back in April 
the CEO of American Airlines warned[4] passengers to expect the rise in oil prices to lead to higher fares, with the 
possibility of less profitable routes being cut altogether.NOW WATCH: Here's what is keeping stocks from

SylvesterHere is what you need to know. The US-China trade war is "on hold."[1] President Donald Trump's 
Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said on "Fox News Sunday" that bilateral talks that ended Saturday were 
promising enough that the world's two biggest economies didn't have to keep escalating tariffs. Americans are 
happy with how Trump is handling the economy[2]. A new poll from CBS News shows that Americans are happy 
and optimistic about the economy, with 18% saying the economy was "very good" and 46% saying it was 
"somewhat good." 
Only 9% said the economy was "very bad." The US dollar hits a 5-month high[3]. The US dollar index hit a high of 
94.06 on Monday, its best since the middle of December. Embattled Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro wins 
another 6-year term[4]. Maduro won 5.8 million of the 7.6 million votes, Reuters says, citing Venezuela's election 
board, run by Maduro loyalists. Europe's biggest budget carrier warns on oil[5]. "Spot prices close to $80 a barrel 
are going to lead to a significant shakeout in the industry as early as this winter," Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told 
Bloomberg. Facebook went public 6 years ago Friday[6]. A $1,000 stock investment bought at the closing price on 
the day of Facebook's initial public offering would be worth almost $4,800 today. Sears is shutting down more 
stores[7]. Sears is closing at least 40 stores, including 31 Sears stores and nine Kmart stores. "Deadpool 2" breaks 
the single-day box-office record for an R-rated movie[8]. Marvel's latest superhero movie raked in $53.3 million on 
Friday, setting the record for biggest opening day for an R-rated movie, surpassing last year's hit "It" ($50.4 million). 
LG Group chairman Koo Bon-moo dies[9]. Koo Bon-moo, the chairman of the South Korean conglomerate LG 
Group, died Sunday from an illness at age 73, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said. His son is a possible 
successor. Stock markets around the world are higher[10]. Hong Kong's Hang Seng (+0.6%) led the gains in Asia, 
and Britain's FTSE (+0.87%) paces the advance in Europe. The S...00 is set to open little changed near

May 21, 2018( Foundation for Economic Education: https://fee.org Delivered by Newstex)  In Europe, air travel has 
been a blissful example of how the free market can lower transport costs for consumers. But now, it is coming 
under fire from environmentalists.The EU Is Moving Towards Even More Taxes on Air TravelWhenever you book a 
flight and look at your receipt, you'll find that a large portion of what you paid happens to be taxes. And still, air 
travel has revolutionized public transport and has made destinations that were previously inaccessible to the 
poorest in society readily available. In Europe, companies such as the Irish airline RyanAir offer return flights over 3 
hours for as little as €20 ($24). This has certainly made the stereotype of the American tourist who visits 13 
European countries in 7 days even more present, but it has also sparked concerns about the carbon footprint of 
said tourists. 
Environmentalists are up in arms about air travel and the consequences it has on our climate, and they demand 
strict action. The reason? The scientific journal Nature Climate Change[1] published a study determining the 
"carbon footprint of global tourism." In its findings, the study claims that tourists contribute 8 percent of global CO2 
emissions by adding up to 4.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gases a year. The researchers 
continue[2] by saying:"The majority of this footprint is exerted by and in high-income countries. The rapid increase 
in tourism demand is effectively outstripping the decarbonization of tourism-related technology. We project that, due 
to its high carbon intensity and continuing growth, tourism will constitute a growing part of the world's greenhouse 
gas emissions."The reactions to this are unsurprising: higher taxes on air travel. Just when reaching foreign 
countries became an affordable option for low-income families, "climate advocates" jump in to ruin these 
opportunities. They have committed the inexcusable offense of pollution for which they must be stripped of their 
financial capabilities. This, of course, isn't any new form of advocacy, and the study is merely a news hook for an 
old proposal. In 2011, the European Federation for Transport and Environment (known as T...has long been 
arguing for increased taxation on air travel. Little has changed in the messaging up to February of this year, in 
which the group calls[3] air travel "undertaxed" despite taxes having risen in the last seven years. Here again, the 
environmental argument doesn't seem to be the only one in their sight[4]:"A T...nalysis[5] has found new measures 
such as a carbon tax on motor fuels, aviation kerosene duty, and ending the VAT exemption for flights within and 
from Europe would raise more than €50 billion annually."Budgetary boost or environmental protection, the argument 
for increased taxes on air travel is making the rounds in Europe, and it will probably soon be an issue in the United 
States as well. So far, the European Union's Commission hasn't made a proposal in this direction yet, but the 
Belgian newspaper De Standaard indicates[6] that: "Here and there, it is suggested that the environmental and 
health impact should play a role in the introduction of a European minimum excise duty on kerosene," which is 
Environmentalists Are Sounding the Alarm: You're Flying Too Much
Brussels-speak for "this is going to become a proposal in the near future." But do not worry because, at least on 
climate change in general, the European Union is already "taking action." With 25 percent of the new EU budget[7] 
dedicated to "climate action," the union is determined to increase investment into the issue of climate change. 
However, the two main proposals on the table as of now are a tax on plastic bags and changes in the Emissions 
Trading System (ETS), are, as the EU Budget Commissioner explained, merely options to improve tax revenue for 
Brussels[8]. Higher taxation as a solution seems to be the go-to mechanism. Where exactly the 25 percent of 
spending goes seems unclear. Certainly, a large amount of environmentalist NGOs will pocket the funds in 
subsidies in order to advocate for even higher taxes. How affected the EU will feel about the environmental impact 
of "too many people flying" is unclear, but it will certainly appeal to EU leaders who, with the UK, just lost a major 
contributor to their budget. They believe that making up for the lost funds can be done through higher taxes on 
traveling. Higher taxation as a solution seems to be the go-to mechanism. Unless of course, there was an even 
more unreasonable idea floating around.Rationing? Seriously?At the beginning of this month, Guardian chief leader 
writer (her actual title; we'll presume the title of 'commissar' was already taken) Sonia Sodha made a case[9] which 
initially appears to be more articulate than that of advocates of over-taxation, but it should frighten all advocates of 
liberty at the mere mention of the word: rationing. Sodha suggests a carbon trading scheme which gives individuals 
a certain mileage allowance over a year, much in the style of current emissions trading for countries:"We could 
develop a similar system for flights. Everyone could be given an air mile allowance—say enough for one long-haul 
return flight a year, or three short-haul flights, so people with families on the other side of the world could see them 
once a year. If you don't want to use your allowance, you could sell it off in a government-regulated online 
marketplace. If you're keen to do a holiday a month, you'll have to buy your allowance from someone else."The 
underlying tone of this paragraph alone is stunning. Rationing is known from times in which goods became a rarity 
by conditions of war or economically inefficient models such as socialism, but it certainly isn't a condition which we 
should produce ourselves. The temerity of claiming that she'd be so gracious as to allow others to visit their families 
abroad is truly breathtaking. Here's a general rule: you are not a stakeholder in the transaction between two 
individuals unless you invested into it. Here's a general rule: you are not a stakeholder in the transaction between 
two individuals unless you invested into it. Making a moral judgment about how much travel is "necessary" for any 
kind of individual is immoral in itself, let alone all of the consequences that this would entail. An emissions trading 
system would incentivize people to complete their miles unnoticed in order to both fly and sell emissions 
allowances. The government would be confronted with airline fraud, fake names on tickets, scam artists in mileage 
allowances, and the like. We'd end up with a system in which companies would jack up the price of miles because 
they send so many of their employees on business trips, which would increase calls for mileage subsidies and 
cause protests in order to increase the mileage allowance, and would generally require a centralized database and 
massive bureaucracy to manage. People would attempt to register an address in a country that doesn't do as well 
in enforcement, or in a country outside of the EU, so that they can escape its jurisdiction. The possibilities are 
endless.Flying Is FreedomBe it taxation or rationing, it shouldn't be the government's role to determine how people 
spend their money and certainly not when and how much they travel. People's movement causes carbon 
emissions. This is part of the evolution of human progress. People travel because they work or because their 
achievements have brought them into a position in which they can afford a holiday. And no, they don't need to be 
allowed by a politician to do so or justify themselves in any way for the improvement of their lifestyle. Human 
progress appears through necessity, and it doesn't stem from the office of any politician or bureaucrat. The solution 
to rising sea-levels in the Netherlands was becoming highly experienced in the construction of dams, not the 
attempt to reduce the sea-level. The improvement of cars that burn less fossil fuel derived from the fact that people 
want a competing product that uses fewer resources that would cost them money, not because a Guardian 
columnist argued for the rationing of car usage. Human progress appears through necessity, and it doesn't stem 
from the office of any politician or bureaucrat. In fact, the latter do everything to get in the way of innovators. 
Evidently, there is no difference between restricting travel through immigration law and restricting travel by taxing or 
rationing an affordable method of transportation. The only difference it does make is that it creates a two-tier society 
of those who can afford the cost of either the taxation or the tools to get around the law and those who will be 
unable to travel entirely. A society so careful to care about the poorest in this world should take note. [ 1]:

May 17, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Ryanair 
Holdings plc RYAAY[1] have lost 7.1% in the past six months, underperforming its industry[2]'s decline of 
2.9%.Reasons Behind the Price PlungeThis European carrier has been suffering from the dispute with its pilots for 
quite some time. Recently, the Spanish pilots' union had called off talks with the carrier. Also, the union might file a 
lawsuit against the company going forward.In 2017, the European Employee Representative Council — formed by 
pilots of the Irish carrier — had demanded the resignation of Ryanair CEO, Michael O'Leary. 
Per the unofficial pan-European body, O'Leary had failed to tackle the issue effectively, resulting in many pilots 
quitting the company. Ryanair, however, dismissed this demand. This Irish low-cost carrierhad to cancel 2,000 
flights due to shortage of pilots. Also, Ryanair's pilots had resorted to a four-hour strike last year in protest.Apart 
from the dispute with pilots, the lack of clarity regarding Brexit represents a further challenge for the company. 
Fares are expected to remain under pressure due to the uncertain scenario.Moreover, rising fuel costs are 
anticipated to limit bottom-line growth. Ryanair expects its fuel bill to rise by more than €300m in fiscal 2019 (ending 
Mar 31, 2019). This significant increase is expected to be a major drag on the company's earnings.Other 
MetricsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 and 2019 earnings moved south 1.2% and 7.1%, 
respectively, in the last 30 days. This reflects investor's pessimism surrounding the stock. Furthermore, the stock 
has aVGM Score[3]of D, which highlights its unattractiveness. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for 
Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to 
eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style 
Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Undoubtedly, the above negatives substantiate the 
company's Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation 
sector[4] are GATX Corporation GATX[5], Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. EXPD[6] and SkyWest, Inc. 
SKYW[7]. While GATX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Expeditors and SkyWest sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong 
Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[8].Shares of GATX, Expeditors and 
SkyWest have rallied more than29%, 36% and 69%, respectively, in a year's time.Will You Make a Fortune on the 
Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may 
soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be 
cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices 
plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to 
Zacks 
research.It's

May 17, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Alphabet's GOOGL[1] 
Google division is leaving no stone unturned to bolster its cloud business. The company is sharpening its 
competitive edge against Amazon's AMZN[2] AWS and Microsoft's MSFT[3] Azure through strategic acquisitions 
and partnerships.Reportedly, Google has acquired Cask Data, a solution developer for big data analytics based on 
Hadoop. CDAP is an open source platform that helps enterprise customers to manage big data seamlessly by 
building and running big data solutions. The latest acquisition will enable Google to improve the productivity of cloud 
customers by offering data processing services.Recently, Google also announced the buyout of Velostrata, a 
provider of enterprise cloud migration technology. This technology will help customers of Google Cloud migrate 
their database, enterprise applications and large batch processing to cloud seamlessly.Alphabet Inc. Price, 
Consensus and EPS Surprise            https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/GOOGL/price-consensus-eps-surprise-
chart Alphabet Inc. 
Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise[4] | Alphabet Inc. Quote[5]Google's Market Share ImprovingNotably, apart 
from Microsoft Azure, Google was the only cloud provider that gained market share in first-quarter 2018. According 
to data from Synergy Research Group, Google cloud accounted for 6% of the market share, which increased from 
5% in the year-ago quarter.Alphabet's 'Google other revenues' category, which is comprises the Google Play Store, 
Google Cloud offerings, and its hardware initiatives, surged 35% to $4.35 billion in the recently concluded first 
quarter. This was primarily driven by the cloud business of the company. Notably, Google Cloud now generates 
more than $1 billion of sales per quarter.Google's cloud clientele continues to expand with the additions of Shopify 
SHOP[6], CSRA, HubSpot, Box and Nutanix. Additionally, in order to attract more customers to the platform, 
Google has launched a partnership program.However, due to its late entry in the market, Google is trailing AWS 
and Azure.Per Synergy's report, Microsoft Azure grabbed market share of 13% in the first quarter, up from 10% in 
the year-ago period. The company is gaining traction in the market due to a significant increase in customer base. 
In the last reported quarter, revenues soared 89% at constant currency on a year-over-year basis. Strong adoption 
of its Office 365 suite is also anticipated to boost Azure's top-line growth, going ahead.AWS' market share in the 
period remains unchanged at 33%. AWS is performing well in terms of revenues and client base. Recently, it 
acquired several clients like Verizon, Ryanair and Oath. Amazon's revenues increased 48.6% year over year, 
courtesy of AWS in the first quarter. However, it lost market share on a sequential basis.Nevertheless, we believe 
Google's expanding clientele supported by strategic acquisitions and partnership will boost competitiveness going 
ahead.Alphabet

Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM)[7] | Alphabet Inc. Quote[8]Google Cloud Preferred, Pricing Key CatalystAccording to 
Google on a Buying Spree: Flexes Muscle Against AMZN MSFT
a recent survey (997 respondents) conducted by RightScale adoption rate for AWS, Azure and Google Cloud in 
2018 is 68%, 58% and 19%, respectively. However, the percentage of respondents who are planning to select 
these services is 7% for AWS, 8% for Azure and 15% for Google Cloud.We believe the company's pricing strategy 
is the main support behind winning clients. Google cloud offers on-demand real time pricing while AWS provides 
substantial discounts but only for long-term deals and advance payments.Moreover, strategic acquisitions like Cask 
Data ...lostrata are helping Google to add new features to its cloud offerings. These acquisitions will continue to 
strengthen the product and services portfolio of the company in the rapidly growing cloud market.Per Markets and 
Markets data, cloud enterprise market is expected to reach $34.42 billion by 2022 by growing at a CAGR of 28.6% 
between 2017 and 2022.Currently, Alphabet Carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of

are seeing ads for Ireland in local metro and bus stations, as part of Tourism Ireland's latest promotional campaign. 
The campaign, being run in conjunction with Ryanair, has been timed to take advantage of late booking patterns 
among Spanish holidaymakers. It also includes online ads on leading news and lifestyle websites such as El Pas, 
El Periódico and El Diario.es, which will be seen by around 5.6m people. Spain is an important market for tourism to 
the island of Ireland and travel to Ireland has grown significantly over the past 17 years - going from just 90,000 
Spanish visitors in 2000 to a record 443,200 in 2017. Barbara Wood, Tourism Ireland's Manager in Spain, said: 
'2017 was the best year ever for Spanish visitor numbers to Ireland. And, the good news is that the most recent 
CSO figures confirm growth of 5.4% for the first quarter of this year.'

May 01, 2018( Free Movement: http://www.freemovement.org.uk Delivered by Newstex)  In Ryanair v Secretary of 
State for the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 899[1] the budget airline, no stranger to litigation, challenged the 
imposition of a 2,000 fine on it for carrying a man from Germany to the UK who, said the Secretary of State, had 
failed to produce the requisite documentation under section 40[2] of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. Section 
40 states:(1) This section applies if an individual requiring leave to enter the United Kingdom arrives in the United 
Kingdom by ship or aircraft and, on being required to do so by an immigration officer, fails to produce— (a) an 
immigration document which is in force and which satisfactorily establishes his identity and his nationality or 
citizenship, and (b) if the individual requires a visa, a visa of the required kind. (2) The Secretary of State may 
charge the owner of the ship or aircraft, in respect of the individual, the sum of 2,000.Mevludin Alibegovic, a citizen 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was travelling to the UK for one night with his son, an Austrian national. At check-in, he 
presented a document issued by the Austrian authorities bearing the legend 'daueraufenthalt-familienangehöriger' 
('permanent residence, family member') and satisfied the person checking documentation. On arrival, immigration 
officers stopped him. 
Satisfied, they were not. They refused leave to enter and ordered Ryanair to carry MrAlibegovic back to Germany, 
which it did the next day, apparently on the flight on which he was already booked. Ryanair was subsequently 
givennotice[3] of a potential liability to a fine of 2,000 under section 40[4] and, in due course, fined. It appealed 
under section 40B[5] of the 1999 Act. There was some dispute about the grounds the Court of Appeal could 
consider, but the case resolved itself into an argument that the requisite documentation had been presented or, in 
the alternative, that section 40[6] of the 1999 Act was an unlawful restriction on free movement rights.When is a 
residence card not a residence card?Ryanair relied on section 7(1)[7] of the Immigration Act 1988, which provides 
that a person entitled to enter or remain in the exercise of EU rights does not require leave to enter or remain in the 
UK. The Court of Appeal examined article 5(2)[8] of Directive 2004/38/EC, the 'free movement' directive:Family 
members who are not nationals of a Member State shall only be required to have an entry visa in accordance with 
Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 or, where appropriate, with national law. For the purposes of this Directive, 
possession of the valid residence card referred to in Article 10 shall exempt such family members from the visa 
requirement.The court held that to be 'a residence card referred to in Article 10,' for the purposes of article 5(2), a 
card must state 'Residence card of a family member of a Union citizen' (in the appropriate language, as Lord 
Justice Newey was careful to add). While other documents might be useful for the purposes of article 5(4)[9]:Where 
a Union citizen, or a family member who is not a national of a Member State, does not have the necessary travel 
documents or, if required, the necessary visas, the Member State concerned shall, before turning them back, give 
Carriers' liability: Ryanair challenges the Secretary of State - and loses
such persons every reasonable opportunity to corroborate or prove by other means that they are covered by the 
right of free movement and residencethey would not constitute such cards. The court further held, as a matter of 
construction of article 5(2), that a permanent residence card, which is issued under article 20[10]rather thanarticle 
10[11], would not serve to exempt family members from the visa requirement. Albeit, readers will be relieved to 
learn, that it 'may potentially afford strong evidence of a right of free movement' (paragraph 38 of the 
judgment).Ryanair sought to pursue the argument that MrAlibegovic had not been given sufficient opportunity to 
prove 'by other means' as per article 5(4)that he was covered by the right of free movement. But, having not raised 
the point in its original grounds, the carrier was prevented from doing so. Lord Justice Newey observed that it was 
unlikely in any event that a person coming on a day trip would be carrying the requisite proof with him. He did not, 
however, have occasion to consider that a mere phone call or email could have produced all the relevant evidence. 
The judge also observed, obiter, that the question during the interview as to whether there was 'any compelling and 
compassionate information' to justify entry suggested that 'sufficient opportunity' had been provided, which appears 
to confuse two very different lines of enquiry. As to the second ground, we are told that counsel for the Secretary of 
State 'was ultimately inclined to accept that, if a passenger proves his right of free movement under article 5(4), the 
carrier will not be liable under section 40 of the 1999 Act' (paragraph 54). This the court held to be correct and that, 
as a result, Ryanair failed on the second ground of appeal.Airlines unlikely to be flexible on free movement 
documentsThe judgment gives rise to an unsatisfactory state of affairs. While it is held that it is technically possible 
to travel with a range of evidence proving exercise of free movement rights, airlines reading the judgment are likely 
to see accepting such proof as giving rise to an unacceptable risk of a 2,000 fine. The finding that to be 'a residence 
card referred to in Article 10,' for the purposes of article 5(2), a card must state 'Residence card of a family member 
of a Union citizen' ignores that cards from a number of EU countries, for exampleAustria, Hungary, Lithuania, 
Poland, Romania, Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands, do not use this wording. Are they therefore not to be 
regarded as valid documents? Moreover, the UK did not use that wording either until the Immigration (European 
Economic Area) Regulations 2016 (SI 2016/1052[12]) were amended by paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the 
Immigration (European Economic Area) (Amendment) Regulations 2017 (SI 2017/1[13]). (For lovers of detail, this 
substitution came into force on 31 January 2017 but did not take effect until the commencement[14]of regulation 
18(7)(a), the provision amended, on 1 February 2017.) The finding that a permanent residence document is 
insufficient, while grounded in the text of article 5(2), leads to the perverse consequences highlighted by counsel for 
Ryanair: that a family member with permanent residence is in a worse position than a family member who has yet 
to achieve permanent residence. It would have been helpful for the court to have been less equivocal and state 
plainly that a permanent residence document would satisfy article 5(4). It is to be hoped, if not expected, that the 
Secretary of State's policy documents[15] will do so. Should this not happen there may be scope for the European 
Commission to step in, working with theInternational Air Transport Association(IATA[16]), which produces a code of 
conduct[17] for immigration liaison officers. [ 1]: http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/899.html [ 2]:

Apr 24, 2018( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex) ; For Immediate 
ReleaseChicago, IL - April 24, 2018 - Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses the Airlines, including United 
Continental Holdings, Inc. UAL[1], Southwest Airlines Co. LUV[2], Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL[3] and Ryanair Holdings 
plc RYAAY[4].Industry: Airlines, Part 3Link: 
https://www.zacks.com/commentary/158896/headwinds-that-might-dent-airline-industry-momentum[5]The fact that 
the Zacks Airline industry[6] declined 2.5% in the first quarter of the year highlights the fact the sector is not bereft 
of headwinds, despite positives such as increasing financial prosperity and the new tax law.Let's take a look at the 
factors responsible for the disappointing price performance.Weather-Related Disruptions Rule Stocks in the airline 
space have been hit repeatedly by inclement weather this year. Weather-related disruptions cripple airline 
operations, leading to multiple flights being cancelled. Apart from Winter Storm Grayson in January, successive 
nor'easters in March disrupted airline operations significantly due to multiple flight cancellations.In fact, the month of 
March hasreportedly[7]seen more than 10,000 flights being called off due to successive nor'easters. Notably, this 
was the worst March in five years in terms of flight cancellations.The increase in the number of flight cancellations 
resulted in significant revenue loss for airline operators and this is likely to dent the top-line performance of carriers 
in the first quarter.According to the Air Travel Consumer Report unveiled by the U.S. Department of Transportation, 
the number of cancellations increased during January 2018. In fact, the rate of cancelled scheduled domestic flights 
increased to 3% from 2% and 1.2% in January and December 2017, respectively.Public Relations Fiascoes 
Carriers such as United Continental Holdings, Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. have been hurt by issues pertaining 
to animals on their flights.In February, an unfortunate child-related incident occurred on a Southwest Airlines flight 
(Phoenix-to-Portland) when a dog bit the girl on the plane. Southwest started reviewing its policy pertaining to 
onboard service animals, even before the occurrence of incident.The dog fiasco at one of the flights of United 
Airlines — United Continental's subsidiary — earned the carrier rebuke from all corners. In fact, the incident which 
resulted in the tragic death of a black French bulldog puppy on one of its flights on Mar 12, 2018, did not go 
unnoticed by lawmakers in the United States.According to a Reuters report[8], U.S. senators John Kennedy and 
Catherine Cortez Masto have introduced a legislation aimed at preventing airlines from putting live animals in 
overhead bins. The senators have also proposed the imposition of fines on violations of the animal-friendly 
measure. This apart, the transportation of a Kansas-bound German shepherd to Japan also dented its market 
reputation with respect to its pet-handling policy.Markedly, these two mishaps were the reasons behind United 
Airlines' decision to suspend its pet cargo travel service. Even in 2017, United Airlines had the dubious distinction of 
Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights: United Continental , Southwest Airlines , Delta Air and Ryanair
the highest number of animal deaths on its flights.The mishandling of animals has caused carriers like Delta Air 
Lines, Inc. to change their policy on animals on their flights. Markedly, from Mar 1, 2018 the concerned passengers 
on Delta flights would need to furnish documents underlining passengers' need for carrying the animal on the flight. 
Also, the person has to provide proof related to its training and vaccinations within 48 hours before the flight.Delta 
carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks 
here[9].High Costs Likely to Hurt Bottom Line in Q1Crude oil prices are on their way back up after falling sharply 
from $100 a barrel in 2014, to a low of $30 in 2016. Currently, oil prices are hovering around the $66 a barrel mark. 
Mounting tensions related to Syria contributed to the upsurge. As fuel costs represent one of the largest input costs 
for airline companies, the rise in oil prices naturally pushed up operating expenses, in turn, hurting the bottom line 
of carriers. With fuel costs moving northward, bottom-line growth of carriers is likely to be limited in the first 
quarter.Apart from high fuel costs, expenses on the labor front have also been increasing over the past few quarters 
due to the various labor deals inked by carriers. High labor costs are likely to dent the bottom-line growth of most 
carriers in the first quarter.Other Headwinds Plaguing Airlines The long-standing pay-related dispute between 
European low-cost carrier, Ryanair Holdings plc, and its pilots shows no signs of ending. According to aReuters 
report[10], the European Employee Representative Council — formed in 2016 by pilots of the Irish carrier — 
demanded the resignation of Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary.The unofficial pan-European body was of the opinion 
that O'Leary had failed to tackle the issue effectively, resulting in many pilots quitting the company. Ryanair has, 
however, dismissed this demand.Moreover, Southwest's bleak view unveiled late last month, with respect to 
operating revenue per available seat miles (RASM), for first-quarter also dented stocks in the space. The Dallas-
based carrier attributed the downbeat forecast to pricing pressure and lower-than-expected demand for air travel 
due to the timing of the spring break holidays.Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) tentative 
decision to grant permission to five U.S.-based leading carriers to operate new scheduled flights to Havana has led 
to fears of competition intensifying among leading carriers as Havana is popular tourist spot. In fact, in a bid to 
attract 
customers, 
U.S. 
carriers 
may 
face 
a 
price 
war.Join

Flying steady: Aeron is rolling out roadmap after successful token sale
Flying steady: Aeron is rolling out roadmap after successful token sale

Apr 17, 2018( The Merkle: https://themerkle.com Delivered by Newstex)  20 years ago flying was still the preserve 
of middle classes and was used sparingly due to the prohibitive cost of air travel. Since then, the rise of airlines like 
SouthWest and Ryanair have made flying one of the cheapest ways to travel. But despite the fact it is one of the 
safest ways to travel, flying still has the potential for catastrophic failure because the lives of many are dependent 
on a small crew of pilots. 
This is especially pronounced for private aviation.Disclosure: This is a Sponsored Article This makes the issue of 
flight safety a pressing one for regulators and consumers alike. Pilots hold the fates of their passengers in their 
hands, and such a high pressure job warrants the highest possible standards. Licensing only goes part of the way, 
since piloting is very reliant on experience and expert judgements. This skill in many ways only develops based on 
a variety of situations a pilot handles. A pilot who has flown 1000 hours of routine and automated flights may not be 
as adept as a military pilot who has flown only 150 hours in a variety of pressured and intense situations. 
Considering this, it will be surprising for many to hear that pilot logbooks, especially during the initial training and 
certification stage of the pilot's career, may be fraudulently or erroneously filled. Furthermore, it is relatively hard to 
make this kind of information available among stakeholders and validated. It should be obvious to anyone 
interested in Blockchain technology that the transparency and integrity of distributed ledger technology can bring a 
lot to the table in terms of pilot oversight. This is exactly what Aeron[1] are hoping to achieve with their blockchain 
platform that holds pilots' flying records. Problems with transparencyThe Aeron team, which includes several 
licensed pilots, gave an explanation of what they see as the shortcomings of conventional paper based pilot's 
logbooks:'We looked at several common problems. The key problems are that pilots may lack experience they 
claim, as flight log records can be easily forged. Flight schools may be corrupt and help pilots put in hours on paper. 
Aircraft operators also contribute to the problem by often underreporting the flight hours, saving huge maintenance 
costs for the aircraft. With quickly developing technology, aside from human factors, we also face database 
intrusion or loss of paper records, resulting in modification or distortion of data.'The Aeron team have designed an 
app system that can be used by flight school employees, customers, and of course the pilots themselves, to make

Apr 05, 2018( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Almost 
eight out of 10 companies and public sector institutions operating in Britain pay men more than women, a 
government report has shown. The figures confirmed earlier surveys on widespread workplace pay 
inequality.British Prime Minister Theresa May introduced legislation last year to force employers with more than 250 
staff to submit their gender pay gap details to the Government Equalities Office.It published the results of its survey 
on Thursday, summing up the data provided by over 10,000 businesses which had complied with a Wednesday 
deadline.The office said 78 percent of commercial businesses and public sector organizations paid male staff more 
than female colleagues.Some 8 percent of respondents were found to have no gender pay gap, while the remaining 
14 percent paid women more than men.Ryanair's UK operations in the crosshairsThe data set revealed that local 
newspaper group North Wales News Media fared the worst, with 85.2 percent of men paid more than 
women.Ireland's Ryanair with its UK operations was also among those with the biggest pay gaps. 
The airline claimed its data had been affected by the "relatively low numbers" of female pilots in the aviation 
industry.Ryanair has a total of 554 UK pilots of which 546 are men and eight are women. "In recent years, the 
number of female pilots applying to Ryanair has increased and we are committed to developing this welcome 
trend," the carrier said in a statement.Britain's banks had revealed earlier that their female workers' salaries lagged 
far behind those of their male colleagues. Men employed in London's City earn significantly more per hour than 
women, excluding bonuses.The difference is even wider among institutions that are focused on investment 
banking.hg/sri (AFP, Reuters)

on Google+ Share on LinkedInThe publication of a gender pay audit for big UK employers reveals a median 
difference of pay between men and women of just under 10% (9,7%), the BBC reported on Thursday. 
The data is based on 10,000 companies across the UK with more than 250 staff, which includes multinational 
corporations ranging from Ryanair to Starbucks. The median pay gap among these companies is 9.7% but varies 
widely across sectors. The biggest pay gaps are in construction, financial services, education, mining, 
communication, and energy, where the pay gap is in excess of 15%. The lowest is in hospitality, healthcare, arts, 
retail, where it is below 5%. Ryanair reported a 76,7% gender pay gap, which it attributes to the low number of 
female pilots. KFC, McDonald's, and Starbucks reported zero pay gap. Tesla Motors reported a negative pay gap, 
which means women are actually paid more than men. 78% of firms actually pay men 14% more than women and 
only 8% report no pay gap at all. Although men and women are by law required to be paid the same for the same 
job, there are differences in the hierarchy of the workplace, where men often dominate management. Share on

numbers over the summer months, compared to the same period last year, as the airport gears up for its busiest 
period of the year. This summer almost two million seats will be available flying out from Cork, to over 40 
destinations. Almost 100,000 people are expected to pass through during Easter alone. Several summer routes 
have recently kicked off, including Aer Lingus' services to Barcelona and Faro, while Ryanair's Cork to Faro also 
commenced along with its Palma de Mallorca offering. The 2018 summer schedule also sees the commencement 
of Air France's new year-round daily Cork to Paris Charles de Gaulle route in May. This also is the first full summer 
season for Norwegian's non-stop transatlantic flight to Boston Providence. Managing Director Niall MacCarthy said: 
'Our focus is always to work with our existing and new airlines on how we can grow our route offerings. With the 
arrival of Air France this summer, along with additional capacity on 15 of our existing routes, there has never been 
more choice for holidaymakers choosing to fly out of Cork Airport.'

Ryanair's Excellent Austrian (and Swiss ) Adventure Begins With a Deal For Laudamotion
Ryanair's Excellent Austrian (and Swiss) Adventure Begins With a Deal For 
Laudamotion

Mar 27, 2018( The Cranky Flier: http://www.crankyflier.com Delivered by Newstex)  Niki is an airline that I thought 
was dead long ago. In fact, it has a tombstone of its own in my Airlines We Lost 2017[1] post. But after a number of 
twists and turns, Niki has found an unlikely savior. 
It's not really Niki anymore; it's a vehicle for Ryanair to wreak all kinds of havoc. Niki was founded by, no surprise, 
Niki Lauda. Lauda is the former race car driver who founded Lauda Air, an operator which was eventually sold to 
Austrian Airlines. But he wasn't done, so he decided to create an airline using the other half of his name. He called 
it Niki (sometimes flyNiki). Soon after it was born in 2003, Niki ended up cuddling up with what was then styled as 
Air Berlin. The airlines eventually merged, but Niki remained a separate brand focusing on the Austrian leisure 
market. As airberlin's fortunes faded, the question remained about what to do with Niki. In the last couple of years, 
all of these things were on the table. Etihad was going to buy airberlin's stake in Niki and then put it into a joint 
venture with TUI. That failed to materialize. When airberlin filed for bankruptcy, Niki wasn't a part of it. Lufthansa 
began sniffing around the airline and announced it would buy it and merge it into Eurowings. Once the European 
competition watchdog signaled it wouldn't have any of it, the deal fell apart. It was announced Niki was shutting 
down, and that's when I wrote my post. At the very end of the year, IAG announced it would step in to buy the parts 
of Niki it desired. It would use those parts to bring its low cost carrier Vueling into Austria (as well as some other 
spots). But in a strange twist, it was ruled that the governing body that gave IAG the victory in the Niki acquisition 
had no jurisdiction. It was time to go back to the beginning. Are you tired of this? Me too. Let's take a break.Alright, 
now where were we? Oh right, IAG's deal just fell apart thanks to regulatory shenanigans. Niki could have died, but 
wait IAG tried again to buy up Niki in the right jurisdiction, but a white knight stepped in to save the Vueling-ization 
of the airline. Niki Lauda himself was back, and he won the right to buy the airline. Having already used his two 
names but still needing to feed his ego, he decided to use his Lauda Motion bizjet operation to acquire Niki's 
remains. The new airline would have no time for spaces. It would be called Laudamotion (and the bizjet stuff was 
moved out into a new subsidiary). You thought this was the end of the story? HAHAHAHAHA. No. Just a few weeks 
later, Ryanair swooped in to buy a quarter of Laudamotion[2] with plans to buy an additional 50 percent. The saga 
is done for now. And this is where things get interesting. Laudamotion is going to focus on flying from Austria, 
Germany, and Switzerland to leisure destinations primarily in the Mediterranean. It has 15 A320 family aircraft now 
and it's going to wet lease six 737s from Ryanair this year so it can do a full summer of flying. According to Ryanair, 
Laudamotion will have a fleet of 30 airplanes and be profitable by the third year of operation. So, uh, why?  Well, 
there are a few reasons why Laudamotion (or LaudaMotion, the press release can't even decide which is right[3]) is 
Ryanair's Excellent Austrian (and Swiss ) Adventure Begins With a Deal For Laudamotion
attractive to Ryanair. First, there's the easy access into Vienna. Today, Ryanair doesn't fly to Vienna at all. Wizz is 
planning a huge build-up this summer to try and take advantage, but it's going to have a much harder time 
competing against Ryanair than it would have against Laudamotion alone. Ryanair also has nothing in Zurich, a city 
which Laudamotion will serve from several cities[4]. So the network is largely complimentary, and that's not a bad 
thing. But then there's this quote from Michael O'Leary I noticed in the press release. The LaudaMotion AOC will 
support a fleet of Airbus aircraft which is something we have hoped to develop within the Ryanair Group for some 
years. Ah, yes, interesting. Ryanair has been all-Boeing for a very long time, and it beats the heck out of the 
manufacturer to make sure it gets a rock bottom price each time it places an order. While Ryanair threatens to go to 
Airbus from time to time, that threat hasn't seemed all that real until now. Sure, this is a small fleet of Airbus aircraft 
for now, but it can grow. And if Ryanair has any kind of Airbus fleet at all, that makes the threat of an order going 
the other way even greater. Heck, that alone might provide enough value to justify the 100 million euros Ryanair is 
putting into the airline if it knocks a few bucks off the next big aircraft order. In the end, this is relatively low risk for 
Ryanair, but it gets to experiment with some new toys (airplanes and airports). I think of it as a sandbox, and it 
should be a fun one to play in. [ 1]: http://crankyflier.com/2017/12/26/airlines-we-lost-2017/ [ 2]:

Mar 26, 2018( The Today File: http://blogs.seattletimes.com/today/ Delivered by Newstex)  Irish airline Aer Lingus 
begins flying between Seattle and Dublin in May, opening a new gateway to Europe for the Pacific Northwest. In an 
interview, Chief Executive Stephen Kavanagh said Aer Lingus will partner with Alaska Airlines to serve business 
and tourist travel between here and Ireland.'We have strong demand at both ends of the route,' Kavanagh said. And 
discussing his aircraft needs as he plans an ambitious U.S. expansion, he explained why for the foreseeable future 
his will be a largely Airbus fleet. 
Most Read Business Stories Unlimited Digital Access: $1 for 4 weeks[1]Starting May 18, the airline will operate a 
summer schedule of four Seattle-Dublin nonstop flights a week, reduced to three in the winter. Born as Ireland's 
government-owned national flag carrier, Aer Lingus has long been privatized and was transformed by the intense 
competition from Dublin-based low-cost-carrier behemoth Ryanair. Today, it markets itself with a very similar 
message to Alaska's: Low fares, yet with comfortable, superior service.The Airbus A330-200 Aer Lingus will fly on 
the Seattle-Dublin route has 23 full-lie-flat seats in business class and 243 seats in economy. Until June 15, the 
airline is offering an introductory $595 round-trip fare.Selecting SeattleKavanagh said Aer Lingus chose Seattle as 
its third West Coast destination, after San Francisco and Los Angeles, not only because somewhere between 10 
and 15 percent of the Pacific Northwest population can claim Irish heritage, but also because of tight business 
links.Microsoft, Amazon, Expedia and Starbucks all have significant operations in Ireland. Kavanagh said major 
businesses in the Seattle area directly employ 6,000 people in Ireland.He's even discussing a corporate travel 
program with rival Ryanair so its flight crews can more easily get to Seattle to pick up their new Boeing 737s — of 
which they took 50 last year.He also believes the new direct route will bring additional tourist traffic to Seattle from 
Ireland. As it does for any international airline opening a new route, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport waived 
landing fees for two years and contributed toward marketing costs with a total incentive package worth $1.1 
million.To make the route successful, the airline is promoting Dublin as a hub for Aer Lingus connections to more 
than 70 major European cities, an alternative to the larger London, Paris and Amsterdam hubs. A unique advantage 
Dublin offers Americans is pre-clearance of U.S. Customs and Border Protection at Dublin airport on the way 
home.'Our guests will arrive in Seattle already pre-cleared, equivalent to domestic passengers,' Kavanagh said. 
Because connecting Aer Lingus flights with a U.S. network in Seattle is equally important, Kavanagh said he met 
with Alaska CEO Brad Tilden in recent weeks and the two plan to announce a formal partnership before flights 
commence in May. A similar partnership with JetBlue has worked well for Aer Lingus on its East Coast flights. That 
means Aer Lingus and Alaska frequent-flyer miles will be usable across the two airlines and Seattle connections 
can be booked along with the Dublin flight. (Air France, which is launching its nonstop Seattle-Paris service Sunday, 
New Seattle -Dublin route is part of ambitious U.S. expansion by Aer Lingus
has a similar partnership with Delta.)Airbus A321LR versus Boeing 797Aer Lingus' fleet of 53 jets includes a dozen 
Airbus A330s for long-haul international flights and 37 single-aisle A320s for short-haul flights. It also flies four older 
Boeing single-aisle 757s on transatlantic routes to the East Coast.Although those 757s have Aer Lingus cabin 
crews and passenger services, they are actually leased from another Irish carrier, ASL Aviation, and flown by ASL 
pilots to avoid the complexities of mixing the different flight controls of the Boeing planes with the main Airbus fleet. 
These long-haul single-aisle 757s raise the question of whether Kavanagh could be interested in Boeing's proposed 
New Mid-market Airplane (NMA), unofficially referred to as the 797. Not in the near term. The 797 concept is for a 
jet intermediate in size and range between today's roughly 150-seat, short-range single-aisle 737s or A320s and 
the 240-seat, long-range twin-aisle 787s or A330s. At one time, it was thought of as a direct replacement for the 
200-seat, 3,500-mile 757, though the concept has shifted to a plane carrying 225 passengers as far as 5,750 miles, 
or a shorter 5,200 miles with 275 passengers. In response to Boeing's idea, Airbus is pitching a new longer-range 
version of its A321neo jet, called the A321LR. That jet isn't as efficient as the 797 will be, nor as big or as long-
range — carrying 240 passengers about 4,600 miles. But it will be much cheaper.While Kavanagh says that 'we 
would, of course, be open to any new technology that can provide a cost advantage,' he said Boeing hasn't yet 
pitched the 797 to him. That's probably because he was among the first to order the A321LR, with four scheduled 
for delivery next year and eight more through 2020. 'There's no doubt the 757 is a more capable airplane (than the 
A321LR). It can carry a higher payload further,' Kavanagh said. Still, with Ireland's geographic proximity to the East 
Coast, 'the A321LR can fly anywhere we want to fly the 757.' He's bringing in those dozen new A321LRs to fuel a 
continuing U.S. expansion. Five years ago, Aer Lingus flew about 1 million passengers per year across the Atlantic. 
Today, the figure is more than 2.5 million. The airline opens a Dublin-Philadelphia route Sunday. Kavanagh said

Mar 23, 2018( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Irish no-
frills carrier Ryanair has said it's launching its first routes from European cities to Ukraine. 
The announcement rekindles a deal the airline walked away from last year in the face of alleged 
protectionism.Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary announced the deal at a 
briefing at Kyiv's Boryspil Airport on Friday.Poroshenko said the launching of routes to Kyiv and Lviv from European 
destinations pointed to "the quality of the investment climate and the quality of competition conditions" in 
Ukraine.The authorities in Kyiv have been at pains to show that Ukraine is open for business after the 2013/2014 
pro-European uprising, but efforts to attract foreign investment have been hampered by lackluster progress on 
fighting widespread corruption.Cheaper faresLast year, Ukrainian International Airlines (UIA), which is partly owned 
by tycoon Ihor Kolomoisky, denied it had been lobbying to prevent a deal between Ryanair and Boryspil Airport.The 
agreement is bound to be welcomed by a great number of Ukrainians as it will provide more and cheaper routes to 
European destinations at a time when a new visa-free regime with the European Union has simplified travel for the 
country's citizens.Ryanair said the Kyiv routes would be to Barcelona, Bratislava, Gdansk, Krakow, London, 
Poznan, Stockholm, Vilnius, Warsaw and Wroclaw.The Lviv routes would be to Dusseldorf, Krakow, London, 
Memmingen and Warsaw, the budget airline added.hg/jbh (Reuters, UIFAX)

March 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Airbus (France), Lonza Group (Switzerland), Nestl (Switzerland), Allianz

respective sectors, ranking first across the CEO, CFO, and investor relations categories. More than 2,400 buy-side 
analysts, asset managers, and sell-side researchers at over 800 firms named the best chief executives, top CFOs, 
investor relations professionals, and investor relations companies across 31 business sectors. Buy-side analysts, 
money managers and sell-side researchers at securities firms and financial institutions that cover the region 
identified up to four companies that excel in up to seven investor relations attributes including: Senior executives

conference calls Highest quality of meetings through road shows/reversed road shows/conferences; and highest 
quality of corporate documents and investor kit materials. 
"MiFID II continues to drive change and create noise across the investment process for buy side, sell side and

companies are engaging smarter and more strategically with investors to ensure that their story is understood 
properly," says Will Rowlands-Rees, Managing Director of Research at Institutional Investor, "To that end we're

Mar 20, 2018( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Irish 
budget carrier Ryanair has announced it's buying a stake in new Austrian leisure airline Laudamotion. The move 
will help Ryanair secure a bigger foothold in Germany and Austria where it competes with Lufthansa.Ryanair said 
Tuesday it had agreed to acquire an initial 24.9-percent stake in Laudamotion, formed out of the insolvent Niki 
carrier that was part of defunct Air Berlin.The Irish no-frills carrier added that it eventually planned to buy a 75-
percent stake in former Formula 1 racing star Niki Lauda's new airline, noting that such a move was subject to 
approval by EU regulators.Ryanair said it would invest €50 million ($61.7 million) in the purchase, but would also 
provide an additional €50 million in funding for startup and operating costs in the first year.Breathing down 
Lufthansa's neck"We look forward to working in partnership with Niki Lauda to develop his vision for a successful 
Austrian low-fares airline to service the schedule and charter markets," Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said in a 
statement."With access to Ryanair fleet and financial resources, Laudamotion will now grow more rapidly as it 
seeks to compete in a market which is dominated by Lufthansa's high air fares with its Swiss and Austrian 
subsidiaries."By buying into Laudamotion, the Irish company will gain a bigger foothold in Germany and Austria."A 
new player in the aviation market is born," commented Niki Lauda. 
"I'm looking forward to offering our passengers an extensive route portfolio at competitive fares," he added.hg/sri
