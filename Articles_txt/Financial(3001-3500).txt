Oct 12, 2022( Conservative Daily News: http://conservativedailynews.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 'Even the tyrant never rules by force alone,' wrote G. K. Chesterton, 'but mostly by fairy tales.' Alexander 
Lukashenko meets Chesterton's description perfectly. Since 1994, he has kept himself in power as President of 
Belarus by stealing elections, mugging the press, and serving as Vladimir Putin's most loyal stooge in Eastern 
Europe. 
In May 2021, he even forced a Ryanair jet en route from Greece to Lithuania to land in his capital of Minsk[1] so he 
could arrest a leading dissident on board, Roman Protasevich. The least free nation in all of Europe, Belarus is 
cursed with a horrific human rights record thanks to the blood-soaked hands of its maniacal dictator. The fairy tale 
side of Lukashenko is legendary. He boasts a fondness for the old Soviet Union, whose collapse he labeled 'a 
disaster.' He champions state ownership of industry because he says it's efficient, which not even the most moronic 
fairy tale would dare claim. Last week brought news from Minsk that Lukashenko fancies himself a sort of economic 
sorcerer. Facing an annual rate of price inflation of nearly 20 percent, he angrily declared at a meeting of top 
officials, 'All price increases are forbidden. Forbidden! From today [October 6]. Not from tomorrow, from today!' At 
least for a moment, every dictator who prints paper money, stifles wealth creation, and wonders why prices 
subsequently rise must have thought, 'Now why didn't I think of that?' A year from now, you can bet your life that no 
headline in the world will read, 'Lukashenko's Decree Miraculously Ends Inflation, All is Well in the Belarusian 
Economy.' The 9.5 million people of Belarus are about to experience the same painful outcome that price 
controls[2] produce always and everywhere. Lukashenko's fairy tale will be their nightmare. If I could place just one 
book in the hands of every Belarusian today, it would be a classic from 1979 by Robert L. Schuettinger and 
Eamonn F. Butler titled Forty Centuries of Wage and Price Controls: How Not to Fight Inflation[3]. In his Foreword 
to the book, David I. Meiselman underscores the verdict that Schuettinger and Butler definitively provide in chapter 
after chapter: The experience under price controls is as vast as essentially all recorded history, which gives us an 
unparalleled opportunity to explore what price controls do and do not accomplish. I know of no other economic and 
public policy measure whose efforts have been tested over such diverse historical experience in different times, 
places, peoples, modes of government and systems of economic organization The historical record is a grimly 
uniform sequence of repeated failure. Indeed, there is not a single episode where price controls have worked to 
stop inflation or cure shortages Many of the results of price controls, such as black and gray markets, are 
Lukashenko's Mad Attempt to 'Forbid' Prices From Rising Is a Movie We've Seen Before
predictable and have the inevitability of mathematics and of many of the laws of the physical sciences. Nations that 
ignore them are no less periled than those that decree that two plus two must equal three. Market prices are what 
they are because of a confluence of factors, chief of which are the supply of and demand for goods on the one 
hand, and the supply of and demand for money on the other. Prices send signals to both consumers and producers, 
telling them what and how much to produce as well as what and how much to consume. When prices are free to 
move, they act to bring supply and demand together so surpluses and shortages are ephemeral. When a tyrant 
simply decrees what prices will be, and enforces his order at gunpoint, it's mindless to think that everyone will live 
happily ever after. https://www.mypillow.com/ According to Schuettinger and Butler, the Babylonian king 
Hammurabi 'smothered economic progress' with wage and price controls in 1750 B.C. Trade declined, and 'the very 
people who were supposed to benefit' from the restrictions 'were driven out of the market.' For a time in ancient 
Greece, merchants were put to death for violating price controls, a fact which prevented them permanently from 
ever moderating price increases by adding to the supply of goods. 'The Athenian government,' reported 
Schuettinger and Butler, even 'went so far as to execute its own inspectors when their price-enforcing zeal flagged.' 
Inflation didn't disappear as effectively as either the merchants or inspectors did. Similar results occurred later in the 
Roman Empire. Diocletian's famous price-fixing Edict of 301 ended in unmitigated disaster and the emperor's 
abdication. Quoting Livy, the authors of Forty Centuries note that 'State intervention and a crushing fiscal policy 
made the whole empire groan under the yoke; more than once, both poor men and rich prayed that the barbarians 
would deliver them from it.' Printing paper money while declaring it to be 'backed' by confiscated Catholic Church 
properties didn't save the French Revolution in the 1790s. Even with the guillotine working overtime to enforce the 
'Law of the Maximum,' inflation raged, shortages and black markets mushroomed, and the French economy 
shriveled until Napoleon came to power and burned the printing presses. The historical examples of price control 
failure are almost endless, and Belarus will soon join the sorry list. Why is knowing economics and history 
important? Because without the knowledge these disciplines give us, we can be as stupid and as destructive as a 
Belarusian despot. And that's no fairy tale. For Additional Information, See: Empty Shelves and Black Markets:

Oct 12, 2022( Foundation for Economic Education: https://fee.org Delivered by Newstex)  
 'Even the tyrant never rules by force alone,' wrote G. K. Chesterton, 'but mostly by fairy tales.' 
Alexander Lukashenko meets Chesterton's description perfectly. Since 1994, he has kept himself in power as 
President of Belarus by stealing elections, mugging the press, and serving as Vladimir Putin's most loyal stooge in 
Eastern Europe. In May 2021, he even forced a Ryanair jet en route from Greece to Lithuania to land in his capital 
of Minsk[1] so he could arrest a leading dissident on board, Roman Protasevich. The least free nation in all of 
Europe, Belarus is cursed with a horrific human rights record thanks to the blood-soaked hands of its maniacal 
dictator. 
The fairy tale side of Lukashenko is legendary. He boasts a fondness for the old Soviet Union, whose collapse he 
labeled 'a disaster.' He champions state ownership of industry because he says it's efficient, which not even the 
most moronic fairy tale would dare claim. 
Last week brought news from Minsk that Lukashenko fancies himself a sort of economic sorcerer. Facing an annual 
rate of price inflation of nearly 20 percent, he angrily declared at a meeting of top officials, 'All price increases are 
forbidden. Forbidden! From today [October 6]. Not from tomorrow, from today!' 
At least for a moment, every dictator who prints paper money, stifles wealth creation, and wonders why prices 
subsequently rise must have thought, 'Now why didn't I think of that?' 
A year from now, you can bet your life that no headline in the world will read, 'Lukashenko's Decree Miraculously 
Ends Inflation, All is Well in the Belarusian Economy.' The 9.5 million people of Belarus are about to experience the 
same painful outcome that price controls produce always and everywhere. Lukashenko's fairy tale will be their 
nightmare. 
If I could place just one book in the hands of every Belarusian today, it would be a classic from 1979 by Robert L. 
Schuettinger and Eamonn F. Butler titled Forty Centuries of Wage and Price Controls: How Not to Fight Inflation[2]. 
In his Foreword to the book, David I. Meiselman underscores the verdict that Schuettinger and Butler definitively 
provide in chapter after chapter: 
The experience under price controls is as vast as essentially all recorded history, which gives us an unparalleled 
opportunity to explore what price controls do and do not accomplish. I know of no other economic and public policy 
Lukashenko's Mad Attempt to 'Forbid' Prices From Rising Is a Movie We've Seen Before
measure whose efforts have been tested over such diverse historical experience in different times, places, peoples, 
modes of government and systems of economic organization 
The historical record is a grimly uniform sequence of repeated failure. Indeed, there is not a single episode where 
price controls have worked to stop inflation or cure shortages 
Many of the results of price controls, such as black and gray markets, are predictable and have the inevitability of 
mathematics and of many of the laws of the physical sciences. Nations that ignore them are no less periled than 
those that decree that two plus two must equal three. 
Market prices are what they are because of a confluence of factors, chief of which are the supply of and demand for 
goods on the one hand, and the supply of and demand for money on the other. Prices send signals to both 
consumers and producers, telling them what and how much to produce as well as what and how much to consume. 
When prices are free to move, they act to bring supply and demand together so surpluses and shortages are 
ephemeral. When a tyrant simply decrees what prices will be, and enforces his order at gunpoint, it's mindless to 
think that everyone will live happily ever after. 
According to Schuettinger and Butler, the Babylonian king Hammurabi 'smothered economic progress' with wage 
and price controls in 1750 B.C. Trade declined, and 'the very people who were supposed to benefit' from the 
restrictions 'were driven out of the market.' 
For a time in ancient Greece, merchants were put to death for violating price controls, a fact which prevented them 
permanently from ever moderating price increases by adding to the supply of goods. 'The Athenian government,' 
reported Schuettinger and Butler, even 'went so far as to execute its own inspectors when their price-enforcing zeal 
flagged.' Inflation didn't disappear as effectively as either the merchants or inspectors did. 
Similar results occurred later in the Roman Empire. Diocletian's famous price-fixing Edict of 301 ended in 
unmitigated disaster and the emperor's abdication. Quoting Livy, the authors of Forty Centuries note that 'State 
intervention and a crushing fiscal policy made the whole empire groan under the yoke; more than once, both poor 
men and rich prayed that the barbarians would deliver them from it.' 
Printing paper money while declaring it to be 'backed' by confiscated Catholic Church properties didn't save the 
French Revolution in the 1790s. Even with the guillotine working overtime to enforce the 'Law of the Maximum,' 
inflation raged, shortages and black markets mushroomed, and the French economy shriveled until Napoleon came 
to power and burned the printing presses. 
The historical examples of price control failure are almost endless, and Belarus will soon join the sorry list. 
Why is knowing economics and history important? Because without the knowledge these disciplines give us, we 
can be as stupid and as destructive as a Belarusian despot. And that's no fairy tale.

Wizz Air to close Sarajevo base in mid-4Q22

Wizz Air (W6, Budapest) has announced the closure of its base at Sarajevo airport on November 1, 2022, with all 
17 routes operated by the Hungarian Wizz Air Holdings unit to the Bosnian capital set to be terminated.
"After reviewing current performance, it is important for us to quickly adapt our network to changes in the market 
and the needs of our customers, in order to remain resilient and competitive in the market. Accordingly, for the time 
being, we are focusing on increasing the presence of our Bosnia and Herzegovina base in Tuzla Int'l," the low-cost 
carrier said.
Wizz Air will continue serving Sarajevo through Wizz Air UK (W9, London Luton) with flights from London Luton and 
through Wizz Air Abu Dhabi (5W, Abu Dhabi Int'l) with flights from Abu Dhabi Int'l. The airline currently has a 19.7% 
market share by scheduled weekly departure capacity at Sarajevo airport and is the airport's main operator.
In contrast, the LCC's base at Tuzla will be expanded with a new route to Eindhoven (previously operated from 
Sarajevo), as well as additional frequencies to Memmingen, Basel/Mulhouse/Freiburg, CH, and Dortmund. Tuzla is 
located less than 80 kilometres north of Bosnia's capital. Wizz Air is currently the only operator at the airport, 
although Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) will enter Tuzla on November 1.
Wizz Air also has plans to launch flights to Mostar, a popular tourist destination in the south-west of the country with 
no scheduled flights at this time, in summer 2023.
The Bosnian authorities have reportedly approached Ryanair over replacing Wizz Air at Sarajevo airport, Ex-Yu 
Aviation wrote. The Irish LCC does not currently serve Sarajevo or Tuzla, but operates seven routes out of Banja 
Luka.
The nearly landlocked country currently relies on foreign carriers to provide air connectivity, as its flag carrier, 
FlyBosnia (6W, Sarajevo), remains dormant.

 In the past week, Allegiant Travel ALGT[1] updated its projections for the September quarter, taking into account 
the likely impact of Hurricane Ian. With air-travel demand rebounding from the pandemic lows, Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[2] transported 13% more passengers in September than three years ago. 
Again, owing to the favorable air-travel demand scenario, consolidated traffic at Gol Linhas GOL[3] increased 
41.4% in September from the year-ago level. The proposed merger between JetBlue Airways JBLU[4] and Spirit 
Airlines SAVE[5] got the support of two prominent proxy firms. 
Read the last Airline Roundup here[6] Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1. ALGT now expects third-quarter 2022 
operating revenues to increase 27.5% from the third-quarter 2019 actuals (earlier outlook hinted at growth of 29%). 
Per Drew Wells, senior vice president, revenues at Allegiant, 'The impacts from Hurricane Ian have resulted in the 
cancellation of the majority of our flights touching Florida over the course of the next few days. Although the 
situation is still developing, we believe the impacts from Ian will bring down our revenue guide by 1.5 percentage 
points." Total system capacity (measured in available seat miles) for the September quarter is anticipated to rise 
14.5% from the level reported three years ago (earlier outlook hinted at 16% approximate growth). Scheduled 
service capacity for the September quarter is now anticipated to rise roughly 17% from the third-quarter 2019 
actuals (earlier outlook hinted at growth of nearly 18%). 
Cost per available seat miles (excluding fuel) is now expected to increase in the 13-14% range from the third-
quarter 2019 actuals (earlier guidance called for a 10% increase). Fuel cost per gallon is now expected to be $3.87 
per gallon[7] (earlier guidance: $3.80). 
2. In September, RYAAY's passenger volume was a robust 15.9 million compared with 10.6 million a year ago. 
Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) was 94% in September 2022 compared with 81% a year ago. Ryanair 
aims to increase its traffic in fiscal 2023 to 165 million, indicating 11% growth from the pre-COVID traffic numbers. 
3. In September, Gol Linhas' consolidated load factor improved 2.6 percentage points to 81.7% with traffic growth 
outpacing the capacity expansion of 36.9% year over year. The upbeat traffic in its domestic markets is leading to a 
rosy scenario on a consolidated basis. In September, domestic traffic and capacity improved 27% and 23%, 
respectively. On the domestic front, 27.9% more passengers boarded GOL's flights in September 2022. Domestic 
load factor was 81.7%. The volume of departures and seats increased 24.5% and 24%, respectively. 
Airline Stock Roundup: ALGT's Q3 Revenue View Down, Sep Traffic Upbeat at RYAAY
4. JetBlue's impending $3.8-billion takeover of Spirit Airlines was backed by two independent proxy advisory firms, 
namely Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass, Lewis & Company. The firms recommended that shareholders 
of SAVE vote in favor of the deal at its special meeting on Oct 19. Expressing delight at winning their backing, 
SAVE's president and CEO Ted Christie said, 'We appreciate that both of the leading proxy advisory firms 
recognize the merger agreement with JetBlue is the best path forward for Spirit, creating significant value for our 
stockholders and enhancing our ability to grow and compete with the dominant U.S. carriers.' Performance The 
following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six 
months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that almost all airline stocks have traded in the green over the five trading days. The NYSE 
ARCA Airline Index has increased 8.6% to $54.53. Over the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has 
plummeted 27.7%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors would keenly await the third-quarter 2022 results of 
Delta Air Lines DAL[8], scheduled to be out on Oct 13. We expect strong air-travel demand to have aided the top-
line performance of DAL. However, high fuel costs are likely to have dented its bottom line. 
Our proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Delta this time around. The combination of a positive 
Earnings ESP[9] and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. 
However, this is not the case here. Delta presently has an Earnings ESP of -2.50% (the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
is pegged at $1.57 while the Most Accurate Estimate is currently 4 cents lower) and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see 
the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[10].

 This Little-Known Semiconductor Stock Could Be Your Portfolio's Hedge Against Inflation 
 Everyone uses semiconductors. But only a small number of people know what they are and what they do. If you

High Fuel Costs Hit Ryanair ( RYAAY ), Air-Travel Demand Aids
High Fuel Costs Hit Ryanair (RYAAY), Air-Travel Demand Aids

Oct 06, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] is being hurt by high fuel costs. The airline's fuel and oil expenses increased by more 
than 500% year over year in first-quarter fiscal 2023. Apart from higher fuel prices, a ramp-up in RYAAY's 
operations is pushing up total costs. Total operating expenses rose more than 100% year over year in first-quarter 
fiscal 2023, with a substantial increase in airport and handling charges, among other costs. 
Labor-related woes are also hurting operations at Ryanair, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Lower 
average fares also represent a headwind. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, average fares declined 4% year 
over year due to coronavirus-led woes and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
However, a rebound in air-travel demand following the easing of COVID-related restrictions is a huge boon for 
Ryanair. In first-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Jun 30, 2022), the number of passengers who flew on RYAAY planes 
were 45.5 million, up 461% year over year. Air traffic in the quarter was 9% more than the pre-COVID levels. Load 
factor (% of seats filled by passengers) was 92% compared with 73% a year ago. 
Continuing the trend, the number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in August registered a record figure. In 
September too, passenger volume was a robust 15.9 million compared with 10.6 million a year ago. The traffic 
volume was 13% above the September 2019 figure (pre-coronavirus era). 
Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) was 94% in September 2022 compared with 81% a year ago. Ryanair 
aims to increase its traffic in fiscal 2023 to 165 million, indicating 11% growth from the pre-COVID traffic numbers. 
Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in the ZacksTransportation [2]sector areAir Lease HoldingsAL[3] 
andForward Air Corporation FWRD[4]. 
Steady growth in fleet is driving Air Lease's top line. Strong freight and cargo markets as well as improving air-travel 
demand bode well for AL. AL's efforts to reward its shareholders are encouraging. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Air Lease's 2022 earnings has been revised 9.9% upward in the past 60 days. 
AL's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 29.1%. 
FWRD currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). 
Higher volumes owing to a better freight market environment bolster Forward Air's top line. Thanks to its operational 
growth, FWRD is committed to rewarding its shareholders with dividends and share buybacks. In February, 
FWRD's board approved a 14% hike in its quarterly dividend payment, taking the total to 24 cents per share. 
High Fuel Costs Hit Ryanair ( RYAAY ), Air-Travel Demand Aids
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Forward Air's 2022 earnings has been revised 3% upward in the past 60 days. 
FWRD's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 5.6%. 
FWRD currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2. 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[5]. 
 Zacks Names "Single Best Pick to Double" 
 From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months 
to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. 
 It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, 
soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. 
 This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which 
shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year. Free: See Our Top

LOW-COST carriers Ryanair and Wizz Air are flying high after a strong September, as people across Europe 
continue to travel despite economic volatility.
Ryanair reported that 15m passengers flew aboard its planes last month - making September the secondbusiest 
month ever after August's record 16.9m travellers. The carrier's load factor was also up 13 per cent on pre-
pandemic levels at 94 per cent.
Low-cost rival Wizz Air also reported a boost in demand, with the Budapest-based airline carrying 4.6m passengers 
in September - 51 per cent up on 2021 levels - with a load factor of 87 per cent.
Both airlines look set to continue capitalising on an appetite for cheap travel, with Ryanair recently adding 21 routes 
to its UK schedule, while Wizz Air expanded its operations in eastern Europe and Italy.
Ryanair was confident it would continue to grow, even against an economic recession.
"People in a recession will get much more price sensitive," chief executive Michael O'Leary told reporters in late 
August. "We will see a much larger number of people trading down from British Airways and Easyjet."
O'Leary's rationale was echoed by several aviation experts, including analyst Sally Gethin and aviation professor 
Francesco Ragni, who said lowcost airlines will continue to thrive compared with legacy rivals.
"These airlines are well insulated from challenges unlike the large legacy airlines," Gethin told City A.M.
Low-cost airlines ride high against fiscal turbulence
"They have a lower unit cost, they operate younger more fuel efficient fleets, they hedged against rising jet fuel 
costs, and their lower fares make them more attractive to customers who have less spending ability due to cost of 
living.
"They are broadening their geographic networks and have placed huge orders for new aircraft to deliver these 
services."

Indian Air Force scrambled fighter jets to intercept Iranian airliner after a bomb threat
Indian Air Force scrambled fighter jets to intercept Iranian airliner after a

The Indian Air Force scrambled fighter jets to intercept an Iranian passenger jet after a bomb threat was made 
against the flight, but the pilots said they were unwilling to land and after circling close to New Dehli for a short time 
the flight carried out as normal.
The airline involved in Monday morning's incident was not named by the IAF but a Mahan Air passenger jet flying 
from Tehran to Guangzhou, China was flying through Indian air space at the time the fighter jets were scrambled.
The 18-year-old Airbus A340 aircraft went into a holding pattern to the west of New Dehli and circled three times 
before continuing onto Guangzhou according to data provided by Flight Radar 24.
The IAF says it scrambled fighter jets to intercept the aircraft after a bomb threat was received while over Indian air 
space. The pilots initially requested the option to divert to Delhi airport but the IAF declined that request.
Instead, two other diversion airports close by were suggested, but both were rejected by the pilots.
A short time later, the pilots were advised by officials in Tehran to disregard the bomb threat and continue the flight 
as normal.
"On 3 October, intimation was received of a bomb scare on an airline bearing Iranian registration, when it was 
transiting through Indian airspace. IAF fighter aircraft were scrambled, which followed the aircraft at a safe 
distance," the Indian Air Force said in a statement.
"Aircraft was offered option to land at Jaipur and then, at Chandigarh. But pilot declared his unwillingness to divert 
to either of them," the statement continued. "After a while intimation was received from Tehran to disregard bomb 
scare. Aircraft continued on its journey towards final destination."
Bomb threats are an occupational hazard of running an international airline, and internal airline security teams 
routinely work alongside various government agencies to assess whether these threats should be taken seriously.
In the vast majority of cases, bomb threats aren't assessed to be serious and flights continue as normal - in many 
cases without the pilots even being informed about the threat.

In 2021, Belarusian officials called in a fake bomb threat against a Ryanair flight so as to force the plane to land in 
Minsk. The hoax was part of an elaborate ploy to arrest a dissident journalist who happened to be a passenger on 
the flight from Athens to Vilnius.
In that incident, it was Ryanair's stand procedure to continue the flight as normal to Lithuania, but Misnk air traffic 
control managed to convince the pilots to ignore protocol and land in Belarus. paddleyourownkanoo.com

Aviation may be facing a lot of challenges right now, but the long-term outlook is for growth, according to executives 
speaking at a conference hosted by Eurocontrol.
The conference in Brussels, 'Where to next for European Aviation?', brought together senior professionals from air 
traffic control providers, airlines and airports to discuss the lessons the industry can learn from the summer of 
disruption and the outlook for aviation.
"Even though we had a rough summer, a tough summer, at the end of the day we still had a safe summer," 
summarized Eurocontrol Director General Eamonn Brennan.
Traffic in June, July, August and September 2022 was at around 87% of 2019 levels, but the summer was 
characterized by disruption due to staffing shortages. Cancellations and on-time performance were down on 
previous years, especially. "Non-operated schedules", the official term for cancellations, averaged about 6% over 
the summer, Brennan said.
Despite current headwinds such as rising costs and the war in Ukraine, participants were hopeful for the years to 
come.
Gus Kelly, head of major aircraft leasing firm AerCap, highlighted it was already placing aircraft with airlines for 
2025.
Willie Walsh, head of global airline association IATA, said traffic within Europe was around 88% of 2019 levels in 
the summer and he expected it to recover by 2024. "We expect growth to continue to be around 3% per annum 
after that. So by 2030, the industry will be 30% larger."
Lynne Embleton, CEO of Aer Lingus, said there was no doubt people want to fly.
"You saw how much travel bounced back after COVID. People want to fly, economies will still grow, people will 
want to visit friends and have life experiences, there's no doubt about that."
Uneven recovery
Despite current challenges, is there growth ahead for European aviation?
Still, while low-cost carriers Ryanair and Wizz Air are operating more capacity than before the pandemic, legacy 
carriers such as Lufthansa (LHAB) (LHA), Air France-KLM and British Airways are not recovering as fast, partly due 
to ongoing COVID-19 travel restrictions in China. While traffic across the North Atlantic is only down 4% on 2019 
levels, traffic to Asia is down 29%, Brennan said.
The fact that Russian airspace is closed to European carriers could pose a real competitive problem when Asia 
eases travel restrictions, Brennan predicted. Currently, EU carriers have to fly south, adding more time and costs on 
routes to Asia. However, Chinese carriers aren't subject to the EU sanctions and can continue to fly the more direct 
routes over Russia.
"That is going to be a contentious issue... At the moment, Chinese carriers have a huge advantage over the 
European ones," he said.
Brennan also said that he doesn't believe summer 2023 "looks that good at the moment," highlighting that while 
airlines were all planning to operate more aircraft next summer, airspace closures due to the war in Ukraine and 
strikes were all likely. In addition, there is still a question mark over staffing levels and whether airports can run "at 
full tilt".
"However, I am confident we will have a better outcome next year because we have a better lead-in time," he said.
As Simon Hocquard, Director General of CANSO, put it: "We survived this summer. We can't just survive next 
summer... We are all in this together. We all want aviation to be successful."

(Alliance News) - European budget airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Tuesday said that 
passenger numbers have begun to slow after the summer season, but year-on-year growth remains strong.
Ryanair carried 15.9 million passengers in September, up 49% from 10.6 million last year. Load factor was 94% up 
from 81% year-on-year.
However, this is down from August, when the Irish airline recorded 16.9 million passengers and a load factor of 
96%.
The company also said it operated over 88,850 flights in September, down from 92,800 flights in August. 
Passenger numbers for the rolling 12 months to September surged to 153.0 million from 44.0 million a year earlier. 
On a rolling 12-month basis, load factor was 90% compared to 77%
The year-on-year growth in September comes despite Ryanair being faced with strike action in Spain over the 
summer.
The USO and SITCPLA unions called for a third wave of 24-hour work stoppages from August 8 until January 7, 
2023, arguing that Ryanair has refused "to engage in any dialogue". However, Ryanair said the unions only 
represent a small number of its Spanish crew. 
For Wizz Air, passengers in September totalled 4.6 million, up 52% from 3.0 million a year earlier. Load factor was 
up to 87% from 79% year-on-year.
This is down from August, when the Budapest-based airline carried 5.0 million passengers and had a load factor of 
91%.
Ryanair, Wizz Air passenger numbers climb compared to Covid-hit year
Passenger numbers for the rolling 12-months to September more than doubled to 41.1 million from 15.6 million a 
year earlier. On a rolling 12-month basis, load factor was 85% compared to 68%.
Shares in Wizz Air were up 2.7% to 1,567.50 pence each in London early Tuesday, whilst Ryanair shares were up 
2.7% to EUR10.77 in Dublin.

Ryanair Holdings Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary says Britain's revamped fiscal policy could bankrupt the 
country, while rising inflation and interest rates combined with a declining UK pound has one of his top executives 
saying the airline could quit the UK market.
Putting forward the Ryanair point of view in Dublin this week, O'Leary told journalists that "I think what they have 
done in the UK is nuts. I think they could bankrupt the UK economy in the next two years."
At the same event, Ryanair CEO Eddie Wilson warned the airline had the ability to withdraw from the UK market if 
economic conditions kept deteriorating and dampened demand for low-cost airline travel. According to a Bloomberg 
report, Ryanair is ready and willing to transfer its UK-based aircraft to any one of its 36 European bases.
"If there's issues with demand we have that ability to grow and locate aircraft in places that have the best cost base 
and where demand reflects putting in that capacity," he said.
According to the ch-aviation PRO airlines module, Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) and Ryanair UK (RK, London Stansted) 
run 11 bases around the UK, including at Birmingham Int'l; Bournemouth: Bristol Int'l; East Midlands; Edinburgh; 
Glasgow Prestwick; Leeds/Bradford; Liverpool; London Luton; London Stansted; and Manchester Int'l. The airline's 
European bases are scattered across 12 countries. Ryanair UK has eight B737-800s on its books deployed out of 
its Stansted and Manchester bases.
The ch-aviation capacities module reveals that for the current week, easyJet controls the UK domestic and 
international market with 18.83% of the overall 3,143,156 weekly seats available followed by Ryanair with 17% and 
British Airways with 16.6%.
O'Leary adds that so far, despite the unfolding economic uncertainty in the UK, demand for seats is strong and 
presently Ryanair's scheduled seat capacity to and from the UK over the upcoming Northern Hemisphere winter is 
running around 8% above pre-pandemic levels.

Russia loses seat at ICAO council. What now?
Russia loses seat at ICAO council. What now?

Accused of breaching the rules of the Chicago Convention on international aviation, Russia lost its seat among the 
primary members of the ICAO council.
A vote was held during the 41st session of ICAO's assembly of 193 nations held in Montreal, Canada, on October 
1, 2022. Russia failed to collect six of the 86 votes to keep its seat at the council.
Ahead of the vote, several council members of the UN agency, including the European Union and Canada, had 
called for Russia to be sanctioned after it contravened the Convention on International Civil Aviation with the 
invasion of Ukraine.
Among the faults cited are the violation of Ukraine's sovereign airspace and the destruction of civil aviation 
infrastructures such as airports.
Signed in 1944, the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, which established the ICAO, declares in its 
first article that "every state has complete and exclusive sovereignty over airspace above its territory."
The commandeering of airliners, mainly Airbus and Boeing aircraft, leased by foreign companies to Russian airlines 
was also cited as a reason to sanction Russia.
"We'd like to express regret regarding the outcome of the voting," the Russian representative said following the 
decision of the assembly. "We view this as a purely political step and has nothing to do with Russia's position in the 
field of civil aviation."
What does it mean for international aviation?
The council regroups 36 members elected for a three-year term. Russia was previously among the nations qualified 
as "states of chief importance in air transport".
The country may still have a council seat, only at a lesser rank. On September 4, 2022, a vote will select countries 
"whose designation will ensure that all major geographic areas of the world are represented on the Council."
The ICAO council is one of the two governing bodies of the UN agency with the assembly. When necessary, council 
members are called upon to make decisions to maintain the safety and regularity of international air transport. 
Russia loses seat at ICAO council. What now?
Russia's seat on the council was instrumental in the decision not to sanction Belarus following the hijacking of 
Ryanair flight FR4978 in 2021.

Airlines in favour of sustainability-linked financing

While 'green' or sustainability-linked financing for the aviation sector is in its infancy, exploring ways in which aircraft 
lessors can structure sustainability metrics into funding are on airlines' radar, according to Yvonne Moynihan, 
corporate officer at Wizz Air.
"I've only seen one example of green financing so far, but I think that it is something that is really interesting, linking 
a percentage of financing to sustainability criteria. I think it is a way forward," Moynihan says during Aircraft Leasing 
Ireland's (ALI) sustainability conference held in Dublin this week.
Investment in sustainable aviation fuel should also be a priority. "Lessors have the access to capital, they can invest 
in start-ups and help stimulate the industry and help productivity and capability of the technology and work together 
with airlines in that regard," argues Moynihan.
She also encourages lessors to invest more in emerging technologies and ways to decarbonise the sector, 
including hydrogen. "Even now lessors should look into the option of hydrogen."
Quizzed on whether airlines would see value in key performance indicators structured into leases, Moynihan says 
it's a "no-brainer" for low-cost airlines that report lower emissions per available seat kilometre than legacy carriers 
due to their higher seat density.
"It depends on what those conditions are," argues Ryanair's sustainability and finance director Thomas Fowler.
"The only thing airlines can really control is the operational efficiency. If you wanted a higher SAF intake [in the 
deal] it would be a harder sell."
Claudia Huegel, senior director, head of ESG rating and reporting at Lufthansa Group, says banks are scrutinising 
more and more airlines' ESG metrics, pushing carriers like Lufthansa to improve their performance.
"ESG is a matter of fact, no matter what we are doing... there is not one deal nowadays where ESG is not a 
substantive matter related to financing," she comments.
Moynihan says sustainability is key to Wizz Air's strategy. "We have imbedded into every process of our business. 
In the short term we're focused on fleet renewal... in the medium term we're looking at SAF but there is currently 
zero availability of SAF in eastern Europe.
Airlines in favour of sustainability-linked financing
"The long-term view is investment in hydrogen through our partnerships with Airbus and the EU on hydrogen 
aircraft," Moynihan continues.
This week, ALI's members signed a charter on how the leasing sector can contribute to the industry's goal of 
reaching net zero emissions by 2050. 
In a keynote address, the European Union's director general MOVE Henrik Hololei, says he is excited about the 
work being done by ALI in supporting the industry, noting that the organisation is in a "unique position" to support 
the industry.
"Given that over 50% of the commercial fleet is owned by lessors, this means that the sustainability drive must be 
supported by the leasing companies," he commented.
He also called on lessors to push for greater SAF uptake. "That will make all the difference as the industry strives to 
reach net-zero."

The strength of the US dollar is putting new pressure on airlines' fragile balance sheets, driving up the cost of 
everything from the fuel used to power their planes to the aircraft themselves.
A wave of dollar strength has sent currencies from the pound to the yen tumbling this year, and the US dollar index, 
which tracks the currency against its major peers, has recently traded close to 20-year highs.
This represents a particular challenge for international airlines recovering from the pandemic, as they raise revenue 
in local currencies but pay much of their costs in dollars. "A strong dollar is a real challenge for the airline industry 
generally, as if we didn't have enough challenges already, with Covid, Ukraine and the price of oil," said Ryanair 
chief executive Michael O'Leary.
It means airline passengers may be hit further as the carriers try to pass on increasing costs to travellers through 
ticket prices, which have already soared after two years of border restrictions.
Flights for the autumn half-term break in the UK next month are 42 per cent more expensive than those in 2019, 
according to figures from consumer group Which?
Strong dollar increases headwinds for airlines Currency's rise has added to pressures on an industry trying to

Although most airlines have currency hedges in place helping to offset the worst of the impact, the soaring costs 
leave many airline bosses with difficult calculations on how many planes to fly this winter as the global industry 
reels from vast losses.
It is forecast to lose $10bn this year, bringing net losses over the past three years to $190bn, says the International 
Air Transport Association, the airline industry body. Only US airlines are forecast to turn a profit this year as a 
region.
"The strong dollar will definitely have an effect on the profitability of airlines ... I think it is going to be a tough winter, 
for sure," said David Yu, an aviation financing adviser and professor of finance at New York University Shanghai.
Typical operating costs paid in dollars include jet fuel, maintenance and overhauling aircraft, which together add up 
to about 40 per cent of airlines' outgoings, according to Iata.
On top of this, airlines' capital expenditure is also dollar denominated. They pay in the US currency when they buy 
their aircraft, even from European aviation giant Airbus. In addition, companies that choose to lease their planes 
rather than buy them pay in dollars.
"The US dollar is the currency of aviation, for better or for worse," said Chris Tarry, of Ctaira, an aviation 
consultancy. The growing pressures prompted three bosses this week to criticise theUK government for its 
economic policies that have sent the pound tumbling to a record low against the dollar.
Shai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, which has about 60 per cent of its costs in dollars, said the 
government should consider "reversing course" on the fiscal policies that spooked markets, while Ryanair's O'Leary 
was typically forthright as he branded the Liz Truss government "nuts".
Willie Walsh, the former head of British Airways who now runs Iata, said the UK's decisions would have a "massive 
impact on companies".
However, the rise of the dollar is being felt across the world, as it has strengthened against nearly every G20 
currency this year. In India, the rupee has depreciated by 9 per cent, leaving airlines facing a "significant hit", 
according to
Vinod Kannan, chief executive of Vistara, India's second-largest airline.
He said his airline's costs have risen 15 to 20 per cent this year, when factoring in currency movements. "It has 
been tough, the rupee has depreciated and I have not been able to pass that all on directly to the consumer. So 
while the revenue side of the house is doing extremely well ... the cost has also been significant, so that has put 
pressure on us from a P&L perspective."
The problems are exacerbated by airlines facing an unusual combination of simultaneous rises in inflation, fuel and 
the dollar. In particular, the inflationary environment has combined with the strong dollar to push up the price 
airlines pay for new aircraft, often on orders agreed years in advance.
Airlines and manufacturers, including Boeing and Airbus, typically agree contracts that include so-called "escalation 
clauses" that increase the price of planes between order and delivery based on factors including the price of raw 
materials, inflation and exchange rates. Industry executives say these contracts include limits to stop prices 
spiralling out of control, but prices can still rise significantly.
"A lot of these contracts were done five years ago ... and they are getting escalated," said Yu, of New York 
University Shanghai. "Some were pushed back for a while as airlines did not want to take aircraft [during the 
pandemic] ... the end purchase price might be much more than you expected."
Virgin Atlantic's Weiss said his airline had taken out protection against a fall in sterling "months ago", while O'Leary 
said Ryanair was hedged until 2026 at (EURO)1.24 to the dollar.

But airlines still face a tricky balancing act as they try to manage their pricing and flying schedules in the face of 
weakening consumer confidence.
Iata's Walsh said the volatility of jet fuel prices, which have not fallen in line with Brent crude since the summer, 
combined with the foreign exchange turmoil makes it "much more challenging" for chiefs.
"I spent more than 20 years as an airline CEO and I have never been able to figure out what's the best exchange 
rate between sterling and the dollar, or euro and the dollar," he said.

prompt action to protect overflights over French airspace to avert mass flight disruptions.
Amid widespread strikes by French air traffic control, the Ireland-based airline said it expects to cancel up to 100 
flights, equating to 18,000 passengers, and delays to a further 500 flights due to the air traffic control delays and 
cancellation of flights over French airspace.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) unit Ryanair DAC Chief Executive Eddie Wilson said the drop in pound sterling had no impact on 
bookings in the UK but expects the market to remain challenging, Reuters reported Wednesday. 
Wilson added in an interview that "it would be foolish not to say that if interest rates are heading up and household 
bills are heading up, you're going to have less money spent." He refused to comment on the airline's profit outlook, 
saying the recent closer-in bookings have made it difficult to make accurate predictions. 
Ryanair shares were flat on Wednesday's close.

Ryanair boss calls UK's fiscal plan "nuts"

Some senior executives in business have weighed in to criticise Kwasi Kwarteng's tax-cutting plans, which have 
also been picked apart by the currency and bond markets in recent days.
Never one for taking a backwards step Michael O'Leary, the boss of Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) described 
the fiscal plan as "nuts", adding that the mini-Budget could potentially bankrupt the UK economy in the coming 
years.
Speaking in Dublin, O'Leary said: "I think what they have done in the UK is nuts. You can't have an energy 
guarantee that runs for two years. It's completely uncosted."
"I think they could bankrupt the UK economy in the next two years."
O'Leary wasn't alone, Sir Martin Sorrell, chairman of S4 Capital PLC (LSE:SFOR), said conservative members had 
made a mistake by electing Liz Truss as prime minister instead of former chancellor Rishi Sunak.
The ad boss told Bloomberg: "Sunak was the adult in the room and forecast all this. It's like a CEO and CFO 
reducing revenues and increasing costs without a plan."
"In this case, the shareholders will vote in two years, unfortunately."
Former BT Group PLC (LSE:BT.A) chairman Mike Rake said there was "grave concern that this policy is in danger 
of further damaging our reputation and our economy."
Ryanair boss calls UK's fiscal plan "nuts"
Earlier, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also launched a stinging judgment to add to the pressure on those 
in number 10 and 11 Downing Street, with the kind of intervention usually reserved for an emerging economy facing 
a current account crisis.
As well as "closely monitoring recent economic developments in the UK", the IMF said it was engaged "with the 
authorities."
"Given elevated inflation pressures in many countries, including the UK, we do not recommend large and 
untargeted fiscal packages at this juncture" the Washington-based fund said.

The head of Virgin Atlantic has called on the UK government to "consider reversing" course after its mini-budget 
sent the pound tumbling to a record low and undermined investors' confidence in the economy.
Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's plan to borrow more to pay for the biggest package of tax cuts since the 1970s 
unleashed turmoil in financial markets, with the pound plunging to as low as $1.035 on Monday.
Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss said yesterday that he was concerned about the direction of Prime 
Minister Liz Truss's government since it took office less than a month ago. "Truss said she would take difficult 
decisions upon entering into the role," Weiss said.
"Maybe they need to take more difficult decisions to reverse the decline of the pound and ensure this country is not 
left with ... perceived weakness in international markets.
"Sometimes all of us in this room should be humble enough to say that if I said something that is not working, 
maybe I should reverse course. That is not a bad thing to do," he added.
While the pound had been dragged lower this year by the dollar's strength, its decline accelerated after Kwarteng's 
fiscal plan raised alarm over the sustainability of the UK's public finances.
Airlines attack UK leadership over tumbling value of pound; Virgin leads calls for policy U-turn ? Sector's dollar 
costs dent outlook
With many of their most significant costs, including fuel, priced in dollars, airlines are among the most exposed to 
sterling's weakness. Sixty per cent of
Virgin's costs are in dollars, while it generates only 30-35 per cent of its revenue in the US currency.
Willie Walsh, head of global airline lobby group Iata and a former head of British Airways, said that he had "a lot of 
sympathy" for Weiss's intervention.
"I think his criticism is well founded, particularly the additional challenge it will create for his company, given he will 
have a lot of sterling revenues and significant dollar costs," Walsh said.
"It is very frustrating when you see these knee-jerk government responses to some of the challenges they face. 
Clearly in an effort to make themselves look popular with the electorate, taking decisions that have massive 
economic impact on companies," he added.
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary, a persistent critic of the UK government, said its economic policies were "all going in 
the wrong direction". "The Truss government has poured petrol on a bonfire with a budget that does not really make 
a lot of sense, and is likely to drive inflation further," O'Leary said.
The airline bosses' interventions are the most outspoken criticism so far from the business world of the minibudget, 
which also scrapped a planned increase in corporation tax and cut the rate of tax for the highest earners.
Kwarteng yesterday sought to reassure UK banks, insurers and asset managers, telling them that he was 
"confident" his strategy would work.
After plunging almost 5 per cent on Monday, the pound clawed back some of the dip to trade at $1.082 yesterday. 
Yields on UK government bonds, which have surged since the fiscal plan was announced, were lower yesterday.

Wizz Air Malta (WMT, Malta Int'l) has completed its certification drive after adding its first A321-200NX ahead of its 
planned launch on September 27, 2022.
9H-WAM (msn 10389) was transferred from sister carrier Wizz Air (W6, Budapest), where it operated as HA-LVS 
through September 18, 2022. Following brief maintenance at Katowice, the aircraft was ferried to Budapest on 
September 25 and to Malta Int'l the day after. Once induction formalities were finalised in Malta, the A321neo was 
ferried back to Budapest.
Wizz Air Holdings plans to place 78 aircraft with the new Maltese unit by the Summer 2023 season, Transport Malta 
Director General for Civil Aviation, Charles Pace, shared.
The Maltese airline has a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AOC rather than a Maltese one. 
However, its Operating Licence was issued by the Maltese Civil Aviation Directorate.
"We are expecting this airline to register a substantial amount of aircraft in our country, further increasing the 
number of our already strong 9H- fleet. Malta will continue to support investors who choose Malta as their 
jurisdiction for the benefit of this very important industry, and ultimately for the strength of our economy," Minister 
for Transport Aaron Farrugia said as quoted by the Malta Independent daily.
Wizz Air has thus joined its arch-rival Ryanair Holdings, which already has two AOCs in Malta: Lauda Europe and 
Malta Air. Besides the units in Hungary and Malta, the holding also owns Wizz Air UK and is a joint venture partner 
in Wizz Air Abu Dhabi.

The Innovation Exchange, a programme that accelerates digital transformation for large multinational businesses 
(MNCs) by connecting them with indigenous Irish SMEs, is calling on innovative technology scale-ups to join the 
programme and collaborate with MNCs to help address their challenges.
Launched in February 2022, The Innovation Exchange has had a number of successful outcomes to date, including 
20 SMEs that have moved to a deeper engagement with a corporate partner, with one company announcing that it 
has signed a paid pilot. 
Several other SMEs are in proof-of-concept discussions with a view to establishing a longer-term collaboration. 
More than 30 innovation challenges are expected to be published by large corporates for participating SMEs in 
2022. Created by Furthr (formerly Dublin BIC) in partnership with Skillnet Ireland, the programme has announced 
additional funding to meet higher-than-expected demand. The new funding comes following a successful initial 
phase which enabled collaboration between 200 SMEs with some of Ireland’s leading corporations including 
Musgrave, Heineken, Ryanair, Glanbia, ESB and AXA.
At ‘Innovating for the Future’, an event held today to report its first six-month performance, The Innovation 
Exchange announced that it is to open its doors to an additional 100 digital transformation solutions providers to 
meet increasing demand from industry.

solution to prospective customers. &bull;Gaining insights into markets and companies which helps SMEs pitch their 
solution more successfully. &bull;Tailor-made training designed to improve performance of SME members when

selling to large corporates. &bull; One-to-one mentoring to companies around preparing proposals, pitching to 
corporates and negotiating terms.
Discussing the programmes expansion at today’s event, Minister of State for Skills and Further Education, Niall 
Collins said, "I’m delighted to see The Innovation Exchange open its doors to a further 100 SMEs in 2022. With 
over 25 innovation challenges being published by some of Ireland’s leading multinationals this year alone, it offers 
ambitious tech SMEs great opportunities for growth."
Programme Director at The Innovation Exchange, Conor Carmody added, "The Innovation Exchange has had a 
strong start and the calibre of both corporates and SMEs participating has been very high. We are delighted to open 
applications for new technology SMEs to join the programme. We’re not only looking for tried and tested digital 
transformation solutions, but also for the ability to collaborate with large businesses who want to put their stamp on 
the end solution. If you’re a growing, solutions-focused SME then we would urge you to join The Innovation 
Exchange at a time when there are so many corporate challenges on the table."

Budget airline Ryanair is planning to raise prices as fuel becomes more expensive, the head of the Irish firm's 
German business told dpa.
"The average price for a Ryanair ticket is likely to rise from 40 to 50 euros [$38.6 to $48.2] in five years," Andreas 
Gruber said.
The airline is trying to reduce the impact of rising oil prices with futures contracts that fix prices and by buying cheap 
paraffin for its stocks, but it cannot completely cushion rising fuel prices, said Gruber, who is also head of Ryanair 
subsidiary Laudamotion.
The airline sees itself at an advantage over more expensive rivals amid economic hard times.
"In the recession, more people will pay attention to the ticket price," Gruber said.
Ryanair is not alone in raising prices: Lufthansa for example has announced higher fares for the rest of the year.
Ryanair appears to have let behind the slump in passenger numbers during the coronavirus pandemic.
In the current financial year (April 2022 to March 2023), Ryanair is expected to transport 166 million passengers in 
Europe, well above the level before the pandemic hit.
In the next financial year, passenger numbers should rise to 185 million, Gruber said.

will become an inspiration for future journeys. We look forward to welcoming our passengers on board our modern 
planes from Bydgoszcz and Lódz to London ".
"It's one small step for aviation, one giant leap for Lodz Airport Central Poland. Wizz Air will not only contribute to 
the increase in the number of passengers but it is already a strong message to the Polish and European aviation 
market that Lódz is getting back on track seriously. The end of 2022 is going to be fantastic for LCJ! In June, we 
announced three new connections from Lódz to Alicante, Brussels Charleroi, and Milan Bergamo. Today, together 
with Wizz Air, we are happy to announce a new route to London Luton.
We've worked on it for several months, cheered by the citizens of the City of Lodz. I'm sure that this is just the 
beginning of our cooperation with Wizz Air. The economic potential of the city and region will bring Wizz many 
business advantages and encourage them to develop their network and stay with us for longer. Now, it's the time to 
encourage passengers from Poland to buy tickets that are already on sale in the booking systems" says Anna 
Midera, Ph.D. President of Lodz Airport Central Poland
"Wizz Air's new connection to London Luton will mean that we will serve an additional 35K passengers annually. If 
we add to this the new Ryanair's routes and charters flights for 2023, we can expect the best result for almost a 
decade"- adds Artur Fraj, General Director of the Lodz Airport.
Lodz Airport: Wizz Air is coming back to Lódz!
Wizz Air aircraft will serve the route to LTN twice a week - on Tuesdays and Saturdays.
Tickets are already on sale on the Wizz Air website www.wizzair.com. Prices start from 25 EUR.
Luton Airport is one of the sixth airports serving London. It is located approx.45 km away in the north of the capital 
of Great Britain. This connection is very convenient, e.g. for people living in the west of London, tourists, and for 
business travelers due to the rail connection to the City.
Wizz Air was established in 2003. They serve routes around Europe, the Middle East, Israel, and Georgia routes. 
Wizz Air's fleet has over 150 planes. These are narrow-body aircraft from the Airbus A320 and A321 families. The 
specific pink painting of the machines meant that Wizz Air in Poland is called "candy".
Lodz Airport Central Poland now offers regular flights to London Stansted and Dublin. At the end of October 2022, 
will launch flights to Alicante, Brussels Charleroi, and Milan Bergamo, and from the middle of December London 
Luton with Wizz.

It's one small step for aviation, one giant leap for Lodz Airport Central Poland!
LCC Wizz Air is camming back to Lódz and launching a regular route to London Luton. We will welcome the first 
aircraft of the airline again on December 13th. In the winter season, the two largest low-cost aviation market players 
will fly from Lodz Airport.
Wizz Air operated from Lódz from 2010-2013. After almost 10 years the carrier decided to back to Lodz Airport 
Central Poland.
Evelin Jeckel, Network Officer at Wizz Air, said: "Wizz Air is constantly striving to expand its route network from 
Poland and offering new destinations in Europe and beyond. The addition of two brand new Wizz Air stations in 
Poland is a result of our fruitful cooperation with airports in the regions, but also confirmation how important the 
Polish market remains for us. We believe the newest announcement will help Poles to enjoy our low fares and they

Swissport to begin aviation fuelling at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport
Swissport to begin aviation fuelling at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport

Highlight: Swiss aviation services company Swissport will start providing aviation fuelling services at the Helsinki-
Vantaa Airport (HEL) in Finland from 1 October.
Body
The company will take over the fuelling business of Shell Aviation along with a customer portfolio that includes 
Finnair, Japan Airlines, Ryanair, Qatar Airways, Air France, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Juneyao Air 
and Danish charter Sunclass Airlines. Swissport's new Finnish fuelling unit is initially expected to deliver nearly 85 
operations on a daily basis. In a statement, the firm said: "Prior to the pandemic, Swissport fuelled over 2.3 million 
flights on an annual basis, averaging one flight fuelled for every 14 seconds across the company's vast global 
network. 
"Through its Swissport-branded fuelling operations in North America and Europe and a partnership with Aviation 
Fuel Services (AFS) in Germany, Swissport's fuelling business covers 42 airports in seven countries. "At the largest 
locations such as Seattle, Detroit, Chicago, Phoenix, Miami, and Minneapolis, over 500 aircraft are fuelled per day." 
The move is intended to strengthen Swissport's fuelling business in Northern Europe, with the company having 
been active at HEL since 2011. It has provided Finnair's home base with passenger services, ramp handling and 
aircraft de-icing, as well as operating two cargo centres in Helsinki. Swissport Finland managing director Markus 
Vahtera said: "We are extremely pleased to further complement our portfolio of aviation services in Finland with 
fuelling at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport. "The addition of fuelling to our broad service portfolio fits well with our expertise 
in complex hub operations. "It delivers on our ambition to be the go-to brand that airlines turn to for whatever 
ground service they may need." Based in Opfikon, Swissport provides airport ground, lounge hospitality and cargo 
handling services. Earlier this month, the company extended its partnership in Japan with Hong Kong Airlines until 
2025.

Sep 21, 2022( Latin Times: http://www.latintimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 In a drink and drug-fuelled air rage attack, a 31-year-old man punched and kicked a British millionaire, and also bit 
off a chunk from his right earlobe. 
Ben Addison attacked 53-year-old manufacturing boss Neil Endley while they were flying to Majorca, reported 
Mirror[1]. Addison also injured three police officers in the Sept. 18, 2020 incident. They tried to remove him from the 
Ryanair flight from Birmingham after it landed at Palma. 
Addison confessed to the vicious assault, and escaped prison. 9 News[2] reported that a court in Palma de 
Mallorca, Spain, gave Addison 10 months in jail, but decided to suspend the sentence. It means that he will avoid 
jail as long as he doesn't commit more crimes in the next two years. The New York Daily Paper[3] reported that the 
court also fined him 720 euros ($717.38) for his bizarre attack. 
Endley had been advised it was in his interests to renounce his right to prosecute alongside state lawyers due to an 
ongoing legal action in the U.K. against Ryanair, said sources. His lawyers are understood to be pursuing a large 
pay-out from the airline for letting the attacker board the plane after consuming a lot of alcohol and drugs. 
The convicted air rage passenger hid his head behind his hands and kept his sunglasses on when he walked into 
court on Monday. Addison paid the three Civil Guard officers a total of 1,150 pounds ($1,308.12) in compensation 
after the incident. 
An indictment, which is set to be transcribed into a written sentence following Addison's admission of guilt, said that 
his cognitive functions had been 'diminished by drugs and alcohol' before Ryanair flight FR2162. It added that 
around 11.25 p.m. on Sept. 18, 2020, and after causing many incidents with other passengers, Addison "leapt on 
Endley after the plane from Birmingham landed with the intention of harming him." The indictment said that he 
kicked Endley and punched him "several times in the head." He then threw the victim on the floor and "bit his right 
ear, tearing part of his earlobe off and leaving his victim needing stitches." 
Police previously said that the air rage happened when Addison was refused more alcohol on the half-empty flight.

Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) chief executive officer, Jozsef Varadi has told analysts that the group's decision 
to convert its options for 75 Airbus A321neo aircraft emphasises its importance to the investment case for the 
company over the next decade.
This was one of the key takeaways Deutsche Bank analysts reported from a trip hosted by the company.
They noted that the Airbus aircraft is scarcely available to its competitors that don't already have orders unless they 
are willing to pay material leasing premiums to Wizz, and it is an aircraft with unmatched economics which when 
full is expected to give Wizz a material competitive advantage versus its peers.
The analysts said there are a number of risks outside of the group's control such as Airbus' ability to deliver on time 
but the other concerns are down to the company such as filling the planes.
They noted that Wizz feels its business model is less sensitive to frequencies than that of rival Ryanair, for 
example, with the main priority for its customers being price.
Given the subsequent ability to control when people fly, Wizz is confident in taking on the extra seat risk, the 
analysts added.
Deutsche Bank retains a 'hold' rating and 2,350p price target on Wizz Air shares.

 In Austria, OMV and Ryanair have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to supply sustainable aviation fuel 
(SAF) at Ryanair airports across Austria, Germany, and Romania[1]. While the limited production of SAF remains a 
global aviation issue, this MoU agreement gives Ryanair unique access to purchase up to 160,000 tons (53 million 
gallons) of SAF from OMV over the next 8 years (starting in 2023). This would account for a total CO2 reduction of 
over 400,000 tons, equivalent to approx. 25,000 Ryanair flights from Dublin to Vienna.

French ATC strike led to cancellation of hundreds of flights
French ATC strike led to cancellation of hundreds of flights

Highlight: A walkout by French Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) on 16 September 2022 has forced airline companies to 
ground half of the flights that were due to arrive or depart from Paris airports as well as those using the French 
airspace, Reuters reported.
Body
SNCTA, a union for traffic controllers in France, said that the strike was called after no guarantees were provided by 
the aviation authority DGAC and public authorities over pay hike in line with inflation as well as recruitment of more 
workers. ATC is planning to stage a walkout once again later this month on 28, 29 and 30, if DGAC and the public 
authorities fail to come up with concrete guarantees. 
Irish ultra-low-cost carrier Ryanair has urged the European Union (EU) to take immediate measures to protect 
overflights over the French airspace. In a statement, Ryanair said: "Ryanair regrets that it is forced to cancel 420 
flights (disrupting 80,000 passengers) mainly overflying France on Fri (16th Sept) as a result of this unjustified 
French ATC strike, which achieve nothing but disrupt thousands of European citizens/visitors' weekend travel plans. 
"It is inexplicable that flights which overfly France are disrupted by French ATC strikes yet domestic French flights 
are protected by minimum service laws. "The European Union must step in and protect overflights so that 
passengers who are travelling between Spain, Italy, Ireland, Germany, etc. are not disrupted just because they fly 
over France while French ATC unions strike." In addition to Ryanair, other airlines including EasyJet, Air France, 
and British Airways too have been hit by the strike. Air France operated 45% of its short- and mid-haul flights due to 
the walkout whereas British Airways cancelled 22 flights. Paris airports operator Groupe ADP spokesperson was 
quoted by Reuters as saying: "Everything is very quiet, as the passengers had been warned in advance and did not 
go to the airports."

 European airlines including Air France-KLM (AF.AS, AF.PA) unit Air France, Ryanair (RYA.IR) and EasyJet 
(EZJ.L) were forced to cancel several flights on Sept. 16 due to a strike led by air traffic controllers in France, The 
Telegraph reported the same day.
The strikes, which will be continued by French union the Syndicat National des Contrôleurs du Trafic Aérien from 
Sept. 28 to Sept. 30, cut down European flight volumes to one-third of their usual capacity and mostly affected 
passengers traveling to and from the UK. 
The disruption led to the cancellation of 420 flights by Ryanair, 76 flights by EasyJet and 22 flights by International 
Consolidated Airlines Group's (IAG.L) British Airways, with Air France operating only 45% of its short-haul flights, 
according to the report.
Shares in both Air France-KLM and Ryanair fell almost 5%, EasyJet lost nearly 4% and IAG's shares slipped more 
than 2% on Sept. 16 close.

Shares in Finland's Fortum rose after the utility said that it would restart an idle coal-fired power plant to boost 
capacity to Europe's struggling energy market.
The plant, on Finland's west coast, would add 560 megawatts to the market.
However, Fortum added that electricity production would depend on the market situation at the given time.
Logistics and shipping companies slumped following an earnings warning overnight from FedEx that analysts said 
was an indication of a slowing global economy. German duo Deutsche Post and Hapag-Lloyd were both down, as 
were Denmark's DSV and AP Møller-Maersk.
JP Morgan also cut its target price on Maersk from Dkn32,000 to Dkn28,100.
Travel stocks slid as investors forecast that the summer's disrupted travel schedules would spill into the autumn. 
Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, one of Europe's busiest, said that it would cut daily passenger numbers 18 per cent 
until at least the end of October to deal with labour shortages. Ryanair fell in Dublin.
Telecom Italia fell to an all-time low after Barclays cut its rating from "equalweight" to "underweight". Trading was 
volatile and the shares were temporarily suspended in Milan. The broker said that the company was highly exposed 
to slowing economic growth. Philip Stafford

Shares in Finland's Fortum rose after the utility said that it would restart an idle coal-fired power plant to boost 
capacity to Europe's struggling energy market.
The plant, on Finland's west coast, would add 560 megawatts to the market.
However, Fortum added that electricity production would depend on the market situation at the given time.
Logistics and shipping companies slumped following an earnings warning overnight from FedEx that analysts said 
was an indication of a slowing global economy. German duo Deutsche Post and Hapag-Lloyd were both down, as 
were Denmark's DSV and AP Møller-Maersk.
JP Morgan also cut its target price on Maersk from Dkn32,000 to Dkn28,100.
Travel stocks slid as investors forecast that the summer's disrupted travel schedules would spill into the autumn. 
Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, one of Europe's busiest, said that it would cut daily passenger numbers 18 per cent 
until at least the end of October to deal with labour shortages. Ryanair fell in Dublin.
Telecom Italia fell to an all-time low after Barclays cut its rating from "equalweight" to "underweight". Trading was 
volatile and the shares were temporarily suspended in Milan. The broker said that the company was highly exposed

Flights disrupted as French air traffic controllers walk out

PARIS (AP) — Many domestic and some international flights were canceled in France Friday as air traffic 
controllers went on a national strike over pay and recruitment issues.
French civil aviation authority DGAC warned that domestic traffic would be “severely disrupted” with many flights 
canceled and other experiencing long delays. Travelers have been advised to postpone their trip if possible.
Air France said it has canceled 55% of its short- and medium-haul flights and 10% of its long-haul flights. The 
company could not rule out further delays and last-minute cancellations, it said in a statement.
Other companies operating in France, including Ryanair, Easyjet and Volotea, have also canceled flights.
Mamadou Souré, 42, arrived Friday morning at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport from Abidjan, Ivory Coast.
"We were supposed to take a flight to Milan at 9:30 a.m. but it was canceled, but thank God we found a flight at 
1:30 p.m. for Turin. We’ll see if we can make it to Milan from there,” he said.
Maria Oudon, from Orlando, Florida, was relieved to see her flight mentioned as “on time” on the airport's board. 
“We did spend all night worrying about it because they said to possibly change your flight or have other options. 
And we still came because we had to take our daughter to school,” she said.
France's main union of air traffic controllers, the SNCTA, called the one-day strike to demand higher pay amid 
soaring inflation and demanding more staff to be hired in the coming years.

Ryanair worst hit as passengers face mass cancellations due to French strikes
Ryanair worst hit as passengers face mass cancellations due to French

Thousands of passengers are set to face even more chaos this year, as French air traffic control strikes lead to 
mass cancellations for UK carriers.
Up to 80,000 Rynair passengers will bear the brunt, with the Irish budget carrier announcing 420 flight 
cancellations.
According to the BBC, EasyJet has cut 76 flights and British Airways has cut 22, while Air France said it would only 
run 45% of its short-haul flights.
In response to the strikes, Ryanair's operations director Neal McMahon said: "Ryanair sincerely apologises to its 
customers for these unnecessary disruptions that this French ATC (air traffic control) strike will cause them... It is 
inexcusable that passengers who are not even flying to or from France are disrupted."
McMahon continued: "It is time that the EU step in and protect overflights so that European passengers are not 
repeatedly held to ransom by a tiny French ATC union."
The strikes being conducted by the Syndicat national des Contrôleurs du Trafic Aériens (SNCTA) union follow 
months of negotiations on recruitment and salaries in the face of spiralling inflation.
"After several months of discussions and despite the 14 days left to reconcile this strike notice, no concrete element 
or guarantee has been provided by the DGAC (Directorate General for Civil Aviation) and the public authorities," 
said the union.
Ryanair worst hit as passengers face mass cancellations due to French strikes
The SNCTA worries that 1,200 ATCs retiring and a five-year training window for new recruits will "degrade 
considerably the level of public service rendered".
Monday Heathrow disruption inevitable
Heathrow has confirmed that its flight schedule will be altered on Monday September 19 as the UK prepares for the 
funeral of Queen Elizabeth II.
All take-offs and landings will be delayed for 15 minutes before and after the two-minute silence at the end of the 
funeral, and during the ceremonial procession at Windsor Castle.
 Departures will also be reduced between 16:45 BST and 21:00 BST to support the committal service at St 
George's Chapel.

Wizz Air has exercised options to purchase 75 additional A321neo aircraft. The options relate to a previous order 
for 75 A321 neos and 27 A321 XLRs, which was made in November 2021.
Subject to approval by shareholders, the additional aircraft will be delivered between 2028 and 2029.
The Hungarian airline currently operates a fleet of 165 A320 and A321 aircraft, having taken delivery of its first 
A320 neo in June 2020, and continues to target a fleet of 500 aircraft by 2030.
By comparison Ryanair already has a fleet of over 500 aircraft, with around 140 further planes on order.
Commenting on the news Jozsef Varadi, Wizz Air's chief executive officer, said:
"The combination of Wizz Air's ultra-low cost operation and the market-leading Airbus A321 neo aircraft together 
create a strong platform for Wizz Air's future growth in the coming decade as we further strengthen our position as 
one of the world's most sustainable airlines.
"We remain on track to become a 500 aircraft airline group by the end of the decade while delivering our 
commitment to reduce our already industry-leading CO2 emissions by 25 per cent by 2030." businesstraveller.com

Around 1,000 flights to and from France were cancelled Friday as the country's air traffic controllers went on strike, 
causing delays across European airspace.
France's DGAC civil aviation authority said 16 airports were operating a skeleton service, as were traffic control 
centres guiding planes overflying French territory at high altitude.
But several regional airports were closed and the DGAC warned of "cancellations and significant delays across the 
country".
European air traffic body Eurocontrol said it was seeing "significant disruption", with delays totalling over 500,000 
minutes by 8:30 am (0630 GMT).
That was more than three times the level across the whole of last Friday when air traffic was moving normally.
Around 21,000 planes are expected to pass through Eurocontrol airspace on Friday, down by around one third.
Air France dropped around half its 800 planned services Friday, while Europe's largest airline Ryanair said it had 
cancelled 420 flights.
The DGAC said it was working with Eurocontrol to divert planes around French airspace.
The SNCTA air traffic controllers' union said its members are concerned that pay is not keeping up with soaring 
inflation.
It also warns that recruitment is falling short, risking gaps in the profession's ranks when large numbers of existing 
workers retire from the end of this decade.
The union said it had filed notice of a further strike on September 28-30. france24.com and AFP

 Around 1,000 flights to and from France were cancelled Friday as the country's air traffic controllers went on strike, 
with their action also causing delays across European airspace. 
France's DGAC civil aviation authority said 16 airports were operating a skeleton service, as were traffic control 
centres guiding planes overflying French territory at high altitude. 
But several regional airports were closed and the DGAC warned of "cancellations and significant delays across the 
country". 
At Paris' enormous Charles de Gaulle hub, only a few cancellations were listed on departures boards among 
morning flights mostly going ahead, and staff in high-visibility vests were directing passengers. 
"I thought we'd have lots of travellers coming to see us, but it hasn't turned out that way, I'm surprised... I suppose 
most people were forewarned," one worker told AFP, asking not to be named. 
But Christina Sharikadze, waiting at the Air France ticket desk, said "we didn't get any message, nothing at all... 
we're trying to figure something out" to replace a cancelled flight home to Georgia. 
European air traffic body Eurocontrol said it was seeing "significant disruption", with delays totalling over 500,000 
minutes by 8:30 am (0630 GMT). 
That was more than three times the level across the whole of last Friday when air traffic was moving normally. 
Delays of an average 25 minutes per flight were mostly down to the strike, Eurocontrol said. 
Around 21,000 planes are expected to pass through Eurocontrol airspace on Friday, down by around one third. 
Air France dropped around half its 800 planned services Friday, while Europe's largest airline Ryanair said it had 
cancelled 420 flights overflying or landing in France. 
The DGAC said it was working with Eurocontrol to divert planes around French airspace. 
The SNCTA air traffic controllers' union said its members are concerned that pay is not keeping up with soaring 
inflation. 
Air traffic controllers are among France's best-paid civil servants, earning an average of 5,000 euros ($4,985) per 
month according to a parliamentary report. 
The union also warns that recruitment is falling short, risking gaps in the profession's ranks. 
One-third of existing air traffic controllers are expected to retire between 2029 and 2035, and training new ones 
takes at least five years. 
French Traffic Controllers' Strike Disrupts European Air Travel
The SNCTA says the long wait for new recruits means fresh funding is needed for additional training capacity. 
It has filed notice of a further strike on September 28-30.

RYANAIR's boss Michael O'Leary is in talks to extend his contract until 2028, he revealed yesterday.
Speaking at Ryanair's shareholder meeting yesterday, the chief executive told journalists he was hoping to sign 
papers to extend his contract to 2028 by March, subject to agreement on terms.
O'Leary also apologised after reporters were blocked from attending Ryanair's AGM.
Journalists attending the conference, which is usually open to the press, were instead escorted to a media room for 
a post-AGM briefing with O'Leary.
O'Leary said his team had "mishandled" the situation and promised a more detailed explanation later on.
During his briefing, the executive said all resolutions on the table had been approved, including the airliner's annual 
accounts and remuneration policy.
O'Leary, who was initially appointed Ryanair's chief executive in 1994, has been at the helm of the low-cost carrier 
for almost three decades. He transitioned to group chief executive in 2019. His contract was set to expire at the end 
of July 2024.
Following a volunteered pay reduction during the pandemic, O'Leary's salary was this year restored to 
(EURO)950,000, made up of a (EURO)500,000 basic salary and a (EURO)475,000 bonus.
City A.M. approached Ryanair for further comment.

French traffic controllers' strike disrupts European air travel
French traffic controllers' strike disrupts European air travel

Sep 16, 2022( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 Around 1,000 flights to and from France were cancelled Friday as the country's air traffic controllers went on strike, 
with their action also causing delays across European airspace. 
France's DGAC civil aviation authority said 16 airports were operating a skeleton service, as were traffic control 
centres guiding planes overflying French territory at high altitude. 
But several regional airports were closed and the DGAC warned of 'cancellations and significant delays across the 
country'. 
At Paris' enormous Charles de Gaulle hub, only a few cancellations were listed on departures boards among 
morning flights mostly going ahead, and staff in high-visibility vests were directing passengers. 
'I thought we'd have lots of travellers coming to see us, but it hasn't turned out that way, I'm surprised I suppose 
most people were forewarned,' one worker told AFP, asking not to be named. 
But Christina Sharikadze, waiting at the Air France ticket desk, said 'we didn't get any message, nothing at all we're 
trying to figure something out' to replace a cancelled flight home to Georgia. 
European air traffic body Eurocontrol said it was seeing 'significant disruption', with delays totalling over 500,000 
minutes by 8:30 am (0630 GMT). 
That was more than three times the level across the whole of last Friday when air traffic was moving normally. 
Delays of an average 25 minutes per flight were mostly down to the strike, Eurocontrol said. 
Around 21,000 planes are expected to pass through Eurocontrol airspace on Friday, down by around one third. 
Air France dropped around half its 800 planned services Friday, while Europe's largest airline Ryanair said it had 
cancelled 420 flights overflying or landing in France. 
The DGAC said it was working with Eurocontrol to divert planes around French airspace. 
The SNCTA air traffic controllers' union said its members are concerned that pay is not keeping up with soaring 
inflation. 
Air traffic controllers are among France's best-paid civil servants, earning an average of 5,000 euros ($4,985) per 
month according to a parliamentary report. 
The union also warns that recruitment is falling short, risking gaps in the profession's ranks. 
One-third of existing air traffic controllers are expected to retire between 2029 and 2035, and training new ones 
takes at least five years. 
French traffic controllers' strike disrupts European air travel
The SNCTA says the long wait for new recruits means fresh funding is needed for additional training capacity. 
It has filed notice of a further strike on September 28-30.

 PARIS (AP) — Many domestic and some international flights were canceled in France Friday as air traffic 
controllers went on a national strike over pay and recruitment issues.  
French civil aviation authority DGAC warned that domestic traffic would be 'severely disrupted' with many flights 
canceled and other experiencing long delays. Travelers have been advised to postpone their trip if possible. 
Air France said it has canceled 55% of its short- and medium-haul flights and 10% of its long-haul flights. The 
company could not rule out further delays and last-minute cancellations, it said in a statement.  
Other companies operating in France, including Ryanair, Easyjet and Volotea, have also canceled flights. 
France's main union of air traffic controllers, the SNCTA, called the one-day strike to demand higher pay amid 
soaring inflation and demanding more staff to be hired in the coming years.  
Investing in a bull market is fun and relatively easy. When the major indexes are hitting new highs seemingly every 
day, it's easy to find stocks to buy. By contrast, investing in a bear market may not be as enjoyable. But it's 
necessary, and when you have a strategy it doesn't have to be hard. 
One timeless bear market strategy is to buy dividend stocks. And for investors looking to take even more risk out of 
this strategy, investors can elect to buy a group of stocks known as dividend aristocrats. These are companies that 
have a history of issuing, and growing, its dividend year - after year - after year. In fact, to be a member of this 
exclusive group, a company must have increased its dividend every year for at least 25 consecutive years. 
In this special presentation, we'll analyze seven dividend aristocrats who are giving investors a good balance 
between growth and value. This makes them strong additions to your portfolio as part of a defensive strategy to 
weather a recession. 
Here are 7 dividend aristocrats that can help your portfolio thrive in a bear market.

Staffing shortages at Amsterdam Schiphol continue to impact airlines that were asked to cancel their flights for eight 
hours on September 12 due to a lack of adequate security personnel.
"After weeks of improvement, Schiphol did not expect to have to take these measures again," the airport said in a 
statement, warning that travellers could face long waiting times again.
Schiphol said airlines that heeded the request would be compensated, as well as travellers who missed their flight 
due to long queues.
The airport asked airlines to cancel all flights between 1600L and 2300L (1800Z and 0100Z) on September 12. 
According to Radarbox ADS-B data, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines was forced to cancel almost 60 flights in those 
seven hours. More than 20 other airlines were affected, including Transavia Airlines, Qatar Airways, Turkish 
Airlines, Pegasus Airlines, easyJet, Air Malta, TUI fly (Germany), Lufthansa, TAP Air Portugal, SAS Scandinavian 
Airlines, Austrian Airlines, flybe., Vueling Airlines, Royal Air Maroc, ITA - Italia Trasporto Aereo, British Airways, 
airBaltic, Norwegian Air Sweden, Finnair, Ryanair, and LOT Polish Airlines.
Travel at Schiphol has been disrupted since April, with passengers queuing for hours and delayed luggage 
becoming a common sight.

Boeing CEO Says Still 'Chance' 737 MAX Could Win Approval This Year
Boeing CEO Says Still 'Chance' 737 MAX Could Win Approval This Year

 Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said Thursday there is still a chance U.S. regulators could approve the 737 
MAX 10 before the end of the year and he thinks the company will win approval for the smaller 737 MAX 7 in the 
coming months. 
Boeing faces a late December deadline set by Congress to win certification of the two variants of the MAX before a 
new safety standard on cockpit alerts takes effect.  
"We are working to finish. There's a chance but there's also a chance it doesn't," Calhoun told reporters on the 
sidelines of an aviation event. Calhoun said he thought the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) would approve 
the 737 MAX 7 before the end of the year. 
Calhoun said if needed, Boeing would seek "some kind of extension" and make a case based on the "safety 
argument to win." 
Acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen said earlier Thursday that the agency would not commit to a timeline to 
approve the Boeing 737 MAX 7 or 10. 
"We are working through that as purposefully as we can and we will get it done when we get it done," Nolen said.  
Some Boeing customers and analysts do not think there is enough time remaining for the FAA to complete 
certification tasks before the deadline for the MAX 10 but think the MAX 7 could win approval later this year. 
Calhoun said the review of the MAX 7 requires a big documentation effort in order to win approval and "is a 
demonstration that it is the process as opposed to the product." 
Ryanair told Reuters in August that Boeing appears to have accepted it will not be able to certify its MAX 10 aircraft 
by year-end, but it remains possible that U.S. lawmakers could give it more time. 
Nolen said Congress had required Boeing to submit system safety analyses as part of the 2020 aircraft certification 
reform bill and they must be approved by FAA before the planes can be approved. "That's a pretty heavy lift and it's 
a heavy lift for Boeing," Nolen said. 
Congress could opt to waive those cockpit alerting requirements or give Boeing an extension. "We are going to let 
the 10 take whatever time takes to do it safely," Nolen said. "The decision as to whether or not it goes beyond the 
new year rests with Congress."

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) urged the European Union to take immediate action ahead of the French air traffic control all-day 
strike on Friday that forced it to cancel 420 flights, disrupting 80,000 passengers.
In a Thursday release, the budget airline called on the EU to protect French overflights under minimum service laws 
so that passengers traveling between locations like Spain, Italy, Ireland, and Germany are not disrupted.
The company said the EU should require the French air traffic control groups to engage in binding arbitration 
instead of strikes and allow other air traffic controllers in Europe to manage overflights over France during strikes.
Ryanair's shares rose more than 1% on Thursday afternoon.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) blocked media from attending its annual general meeting on Thursday at the last minute, Reuters 
reported the same day.
A company spokesperson said that the decision was taken on Thursday morning but declined to explain further. 
Reporters who were supposed to be brought to the meeting room were instead taken to a media room and told that 
Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary would speak to them after the conclusion of the meeting.
The move comes a day after John Mulligan, a reporter from the Irish Independent newspaper, was denied access 
to the event. The airline offered access to any other reporter instead, but the newspaper declined the offer on 
grounds that the company should not dictate who covers an event.
Ryanair was up more than 1% in Thursday morning trading.

Ryanair cancels Hungary routes over windfall tax dispute
Ryanair cancels Hungary routes over windfall tax dispute

BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Budget airline Ryanair announced Tuesday that it will cancel several routes through 
Hungary and cut flights on several more following a months-long dispute with the country's government over a 
special windfall tax placed on airlines.
The Ireland-based company's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said at a press conference in Hungary's capital that Ryanair 
had planned to launch 10 new routes through Budapest and base an additional airplane at its airport this winter.
“Sadly, however, those plans have now fallen at the altar of the Hungarian government's decision to impose a 
ludicrous and idiotic excess profits tax on the airline sector, which has reported record losses,” O'Leary said.
Instead of expanding its presence in Hungary as planned to more than 5 million passengers next year, Ryanair will 
eliminate eight of its previously operating 53 routes through Budapest while imposing frequency cuts on seven 
more, he said.
This will reduce the company's yearly passenger load in Hungary from 4.5 million to under 4 million, he added.
The decision came in response to Hungary's government fining the low-cost airline more than 750,000 euros 
($753,000) in August for alleged consumer protection violations. The fine came after the company raised ticket 
prices to cope with a tax on what the government calls “extra profits” of industries ranging from airlines to banks.
The nationalist government argued that such industries have enjoyed windfall profits arising from soaring demand 
after the COVID-19 pandemic, and should contribute to the country’s economic recovery.
But on Tuesday, O'Leary said Ryanair had posted 1.26 billion euros in losses in the last two years, and that 
targeting it and other airlines with excess profits taxes was “inexplicable.”
“We cannot get any explanation from the Hungarian government as to why an industry or a sector which is making 
record losses is being asked to pay excess profits,” O'Leary said.
Ryanair cancels Hungary routes over windfall tax dispute
Ryanair will appeal the “bogus” fine imposed on it by Hungary's consumer protection authority in Hungarian courts, 
O'Leary said, adding that “we confidently expect we will lose,” but that the company will then appeal in European 
Union courts.
He also took a swipe at Hungary's consumer protection agency, questioning its independence and accusing it of 
taking political cues from the Minister of Justice in imposing the fine.
“It's not too late for the Hungarian government to realize the error of their ways," O'Leary said. "The future of 
Hungarian tourism and industry lies entirely on making Hungary an attractive destination and a low-cost, 
competitive destination here in Central Europe.”

Body
Irish low-cost airline Ryanair is cancelling several flights to and from Budapest because of a new excess profit tax in 
Hungary.
The move affects eight out of 53 destinations that will be cancelled completely and seven other routes where the 
number of flights will be reduced, Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said at a press conference in Budapest on 
Tuesday.
"The Hungarian [government's] idiotic 'excess profits' tax on the loss-making air transport sector (and Hungarian 
citizens/visitors) has done nothing but damage Hungarian tourism, connectivity, traffic, and jobs as evidenced by 
these severe cuts to our Budapest winter schedule, which were made in direct response to this ridiculous 'excess 
profits' tax," he said.
Hungary's right-wing nationalist government introduced the tax in July this year to skim off real or perceived excess 
profits from various sectors of the economy.
Among others, energy companies, banks, insurance and telecom firms have fallen under the new taxation. Airlines 
have to pay around (EURO)10 ($10) to the state for each ticket departing from a Hungarian airport.
Ryanair immediately included this amount in their ticket prices. However, the relevant Hungarian tax law explicitly 
prohibits this practice. The Hungarian consumer protection authority therefore fined the Irish airline 300 million 
forints ($752,725) in August.
Ryanair announced that it would take legal action and, if necessary, go to EU courts: The airline argues that the 
Hungarian ban on offsetting tax increases with price increases violates European law.

Investing in a bull market is fun and relatively easy. When the major indexes are hitting new highs seemingly every 
day, it's easy to find stocks to buy. By contrast, investing in a bear market may not be as enjoyable. But it's 
necessary, and when you have a strategy it doesn't have to be hard. 
One timeless bear market strategy is to buy dividend stocks. And for investors looking to take even more risk out of 
this strategy, investors can elect to buy a group of stocks known as dividend aristocrats. These are companies that 
have a history of issuing, and growing, its dividend year - after year - after year. In fact, to be a member of this 
exclusive group, a company must have increased its dividend every year for at least 25 consecutive years. 
In this special presentation, we'll analyze seven dividend aristocrats who are giving investors a good balance 
between growth and value. This makes them strong additions to your portfolio as part of a defensive strategy to 
weather a recession. 
Here are 7 dividend aristocrats that can help your portfolio thrive in a bear market.

Ryanair closes Brussels National base this winter over taxes
Ryanair closes Brussels National base this winter over taxes

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) will temporarily close its two-aircraft base at Brussels National, Belgium, on October 29, 
2022 for the winter 2022 season, citing as reason higher costs, including an airport fee hike and new taxes imposed 
by the Belgian government. However, the Irish budget carrier will continue to operate 12 routes to the airport using 
aircraft based outside of Belgium.
Making the announcement, Group Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary slammed the Belgium government for 
introducing what he called "ludicrous", "idiotic", and "absurd" new taxes, including a EUR2 euros (USD2.01) tax per 
departing passenger on European Union routes and a "fake eco-tax" of EUR10 (USD10.09) for every passenger 
taking a flight less than 500km. "At the same time, the most polluting long-haul (and connecting) flights continue to 
pay zero environmental taxes. If the Belgian government were serious about tackling climate change, why are they 
exempting connecting passengers (the biggest polluters of all) from the EUR10 eco-tax?" he charged.
He said Brussels National had also chosen to increase its fees, making it more uncompetitive with other European 
airports (including Brussels Charleroi, where Ryanair has 15 aircraft stationed), which had implemented traffic 
recovery incentive schemes for all airlines. "This winter will be extremely challenging with high oil prices, and so 
higher cost airports [...] are not sustainable," O'Leary said.
All Ryanair flight crew (including ten pilots and 6o cabin crew) would be offered alternative positions within the 
Ryanair network, including some positions at Charleroi.
Even though the airline's statement said the closure was seasonal, Dutch-language VRT News quoted O'Leary 
saying the Irish budget carrier would only return to Brussels National if the taxes were abolished. "We will only 
return when the flight tax disappears," he said.
Brussels National, in a statement, said Ryanair flights represented just 8% of total passenger traffic at the airport: 
30 flights (15 rotations) a day, of which ten flights (five rotations) were with crew stationed in Belgium.
"Ryanair's decision only has a limited impact on the network of destinations at Brussels Airport," the airport said. 
"Although Ryanair's operations contribute to the offer at Brussels Airport, other airlines offer the same destinations, 
with the exception of Pisa [Italy] and Amman Queen Alia [Jordan]. Brussels Airport expects other airlines to offer 
their services to these destinations."
Ryanair closes Brussels National base this winter over taxes
The airport said it had consulted airlines on its tariff proposal for 2023-2027, currently being analysed by Belgium's 
economic regulator who would make a decision by the end of the year. It said the proposed fee increase took into 
account the sharp rise in energy prices and high inflation which strongly impacted the cost of airport operations.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) will temporarily close its two-aircraft base at Brussels National, Belgium, on October 29, 
2022 for the winter 2022 season, citing as reason higher costs, including an airport fee hike and new taxes imposed 
by the Belgian government. However, the Irish budget carrier will continue to operate 12 routes to the airport using 
aircraft based outside of Belgium.
Making the announcement, Group Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary slammed the Belgium government for 
introducing what he called "ludicrous", "idiotic", and "absurd" new taxes, including a EUR2 euros (USD2.01) tax per 
departing passenger on European Union routes and a "fake eco-tax" of EUR10 (USD10.09) for every passenger 
taking a flight less than 500km. "At the same time, the most polluting long-haul (and connecting) flights continue to 
pay zero environmental taxes. If the Belgian government were serious about tackling climate change, why are they 
exempting connecting passengers (the biggest polluters of all) from the EUR10 eco-tax?" he charged.
He said Brussels National had also chosen to increase its fees, making it more uncompetitive with other European 
airports (including Brussels Charleroi, where Ryanair has 15 aircraft stationed), which had implemented traffic 
recovery incentive schemes for all airlines. "This winter will be extremely challenging with high oil prices, and so 
higher cost airports [...] are not sustainable," O'Leary said.
All Ryanair flight crew (including ten pilots and 6o cabin crew) would be offered alternative positions within the 
Ryanair network, including some positions at Charleroi.
Even though the airline's statement said the closure was seasonal, Dutch-language VRT News quoted O'Leary 
saying the Irish budget carrier would only return to Brussels National if the taxes were abolished. "We will only 
return when the flight tax disappears," he said.

Dirty Mess on Plane Leads to Questions About Cleaning Protocols
Dirty Mess on Plane Leads to Questions About Cleaning Protocols

When COVID-19 hit two years ago, airlines made it a point to significantly upgrade their respective cleaning 
measures on planes.
Now, a TikTok video from a passenger showing a filthy mess on a plane as flyers boarded the flight has prompted a 
social media backlash and questions about whether airlines are still following the rigid guidelines it imposed in the 
wake of the pandemic.
The video was from a recent Ryanair flight from the Canary Islands to London. Let's just say it wasn't one of those 
fun safety videos that airlines like to show just before takeoff. This one included several disturbing images of snacks 
and crumbs on the floor of the cabin that had not been vacuumed or cleaned before the next flight.
The story was first reported by the New York Times, which showed images of the mess.
The story quickly caught the eyes of social media users, who were only too happy to answer the question the Times 
posed about who was to blame for such a mess.
"Flight attendants are not maids," said Nicole D. Lawson, a flight attendant from New Jersey, told the NYT, noting 
that flight attendants are frustrated by passengers who do not throw their trash away when crew members come 
through the aisles with bags.
And it isn't just foreign airlines suddenly under fire. This tweet from a passenger called out Delta Air Lines:
But many people did forgive the airlines, which have been under pressure all spring and summer for numerous 
delays and cancellations - in part caused by staff shortages.
"They have 25 minutes on the ground they can barely complete safety checks," one person wrote in a well-liked 
TilTok comment according to the newspaper. "Don't blame them blame the people who left it."
Others pointed out that there is a big difference between the COVID disinfectant protocols and just general tidying 
up before the turnaround. Some airlines have dropped the pandemic-related disinfecting procedures introduced two 
years ago, while others have adopted new measures. American Airlines, for instance, told the Times it brings in a 
cleaning between every flight. JetBlue amended its cleaning policy to only disinfect planes that come into the U.S. 
from overseas. Most airlines do ask crew members to generally tidy up between trips.

Ryanair CEO raised doubts over Boeing 737 MAX deliveries

Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary raised further doubts on Sept. 7 over Boeing's ability to fulfil an order of its 
737 MAX 200 aircraft on time and will meet the planemaker in Seattle this month to discuss production problems.
Ryanair, a major Boeing customer, has ordered 210 of the more fuel-efficient MAX 200 model and had received 73 
by June. O'Leary said a further 51 of the 197-seat aircraft were due by the end of April, including 21 by the end of 
this year.
Boeing launched a high-density version of the 737-8 MAX, the 737 MAX 200, named for seating for up to 200 
passengers in a single-class high-density configuration with slimline seats; an extra pair of exit doors is required 
because of the higher passenger capacity.
"We are concerned that Boeing will not meet those deliveries. They are running late at the moment, there are 
problems with production in Seattle and we want to understand those problems," O'Leary told a news conference.
"They say they can. We doubt their capacity to deliver. We were supposed to get 21 aircraft this side of Christmas. 
They are now mumbling it might be 17, it might be 15. It's difficult to get any specifics out of Boeing."
Asked about O'Leary's comments, a Boeing spokesperson said the planemaker valued its partnership with Ryanair 
and is committed to supporting the airline.
O'Leary said Ryanair had agreed during discussions with Boeing last week to go to Seattle to establish when it 
would be getting the 51 aircraft, which it said were needed to ensure continued growth next year.
The Irish airline flew a record number of passengers for the fourth month in a row in August as it consolidated its 
position as Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers.
O'Leary said in July that he was confident the aircraft would be delivered but concerned about a possible repeat of 
delays this year that forced it to take deliveries during its busy summer season.
"At the moment I don't trust what the Boeing team in Seattle are telling us because they keep letting us down," 
O'Leary told Wednesday's news conference, which was focused on Ryanair plans to stop using Brussels' main 
airport as a base.

Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary raised further doubts on Sept. 7 over Boeing's ability to fulfil an order of its 
737 MAX 200 aircraft on time and will meet the planemaker in Seattle this month to discuss production problems.
Ryanair, a major Boeing customer, has ordered 210 of the more fuel-efficient MAX 200 model and had received 73 
by June. O'Leary said a further 51 of the 197-seat aircraft were due by the end of April, including 21 by the end of 
this year.
Boeing launched a high-density version of the 737-8 MAX, the 737 MAX 200, named for seating for up to 200 
passengers in a single-class high-density configuration with slimline seats; an extra pair of exit doors is required 
because of the higher passenger capacity.
"We are concerned that Boeing will not meet those deliveries. They are running late at the moment, there are 
problems with production in Seattle and we want to understand those problems," O'Leary told a news conference.
"They say they can. We doubt their capacity to deliver. We were supposed to get 21 aircraft this side of Christmas. 
They are now mumbling it might be 17, it might be 15. It's difficult to get any specifics out of Boeing."
Asked about O'Leary's comments, a Boeing spokesperson said the planemaker valued its partnership with Ryanair 
and is committed to supporting the airline.
O'Leary said Ryanair had agreed during discussions with Boeing last week to go to Seattle to establish when it 
would be getting the 51 aircraft, which it said were needed to ensure continued growth next year.
The Irish airline flew a record number of passengers for the fourth month in a row in August as it consolidated its 
position as Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers.
O'Leary said in July that he was confident the aircraft would be delivered but concerned about a possible repeat of 
delays this year that forced it to take deliveries during its busy summer season.
"At the moment I don't trust what the Boeing team in Seattle are telling us because they keep letting us down," 
O'Leary told Wednesday's news conference, which was focused on Ryanair plans to stop using Brussels' main 
airport as a base.

Sep 08, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] has posted buoyant traffic data for August, driven by a strong air-
travel demand scenario. Latin-American carrier Gol Linhas GOL[2] also reported August traffic numbers. Load 
factor (% of seats filled by passengers) improved at Gol, with traffic increase outpacing capacity growth. 
With air-travel demand upbeat in the United States as well, United Airlines UAL[3] upped its revenue growth 
guidance for third-quarter 2022. The carrier was also in the news after reportedly [4]threatening to end its 
operations at the New York's John F. Kennedy Airport from October if the Federal Aviation Administration does not 
approve its request to operate more flights at JFK. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1.Owing to buoyant air-travel 
demand, United Airlines now anticipates total operating revenues to grow almost 12% from the September-quarter 
level of 2019. The estimate is higher than the prior expected growth rate of about 11%. UAL is seeing a steady 
recovery in domestic and leisure air-travel demand. Recovery in business travel demand also picked up the pace. 
Against this rosy backdrop, UAL expects to be profitable in the third quarter alike the second quarter of 2022. 
United Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) 
to increase around 25% in the third quarter from the third-quarter 2019 actuals (previous view: up in 24-26% band). 
Consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile (CASM), excluding fuel, third-party business expenses, profit-
sharing and special charges, is anticipated to increase roughly 16% in the September quarter from the 
corresponding 2019 levels (previous view: 16-17%). Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 
10.5% in the September quarter, higher than the prior guidance of 10%. Capacity is now expected to decrease in 
the 10-11% range (earlier guidance was for an 11% decrease). UAL now forecasts the average fuel price per gallon 
to be $3.83 in the third quarter (previous view: $3.81). 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[5]. 
2. In August, RYAAY flew 16.9 million passengers, the highest ever traffic volume at RYAAY in the said month. Last 
August, only 11.1 million passengers were transported by RYAAY. Load factor increased to 96% from 82% in 
August 2021. The number of passengers attracted by RYAAY in August 2022 was 14.2% higher than the 14.9 
million passengers flown in August 2019 (pre-coronavirus era).

3. In August, Gol Linhas' consolidated traffic increased 46.3% year over year. To match the increased demand 
situation, GOL is expanding its capacity. In the same month, capacity grew 43.9% year over year. Since traffic 
growth was more than capacity expansion, load factor improved 1.3 percentage points (p.p) to 81.5% last month. 
Upbeat traffic in its domestic markets is leading to a bullish scenario on a consolidated basis. In August, domestic 
traffic and capacity improved 31.7% and 29.7%, respectively. On the domestic front, 45.1% more passengers 
boarded GOL's flights last month. 
4. Delta Air Lines DAL[6] entered into an agreement with hydrogen and biogenic-based fuel developer DG Fuels in 
an environmentally-friendly move. The deal is aimed at accelerating the production of sustainable aviation fuel 
(SAF), which is currently at a nascent stage. 
Per the agreement, DG Fuels will supply Delta with 385 million gallons of unblended sustainable aviation fuel from 
2027-end. The amount will be spread equally over seven years i.e., 55 million is expected to be delivered annually 
over seven years. The usage of SAF by Delta is expected to bring down lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by 75-
85% compared to the emission-reduction level of conventional jet fuel[7]. 
Delta was also in the news recently when its management announced that it will operate additional flights for CES 
2023 to Las Vegas (host of the tech event, scheduled to be held from Jan 5 to Jan 8) from 16 cities in the United 
States apart from three of its international hubs. The news was reported in detail in the previous week's write-up[8].

In response to the ceasing of all flights by Romanian low-fare carrier, Blue Air, on the 6th September, both Wizz Air 
and Ryanair have swept into the vacuum left behind and launched rescue flights.
Wizzing ahead
Wizz Air announced it would be launching rescue fares, as part of its expansion into Romania, in a statement. It will 
be increasing flight capacity on flights to Bacau, Cluj-Napoca, Iasi and Sibiu, all areas where Blue Air used to 
operate. It has since launched a special website for passengers to book.
"Wizz Air is excited to make such a significant investment into Bucharest and Romania. We know how important it 
is for passengers to be able to travel, and we want to ensure that customers have a diverse range of options when 
planning their trips. With 13.8 million seats on sale, providing new and increased low-fare services to 36 
destinations from Romania, these actions reinforce Wizz Air's commitment to the Romanian market, firmly 
establishing it as the market leader. We now offer close to 200 routes from Romania" said Evelin Jeckel, Acting 
Network Officer.
Ryanair fares
Meanwhile Ryanair is launching rescue fares until the 31st October, although passengers are only able to get low-
fare tickets until the 9th September.
"Ryanair is once again saving the day with rescue fares [...]to accommodate customers affected by Blue Air's 
sudden 'suspension' of operations. While Blue Air are 'suspending' flights across Europe, Ryanair continues to 
operate a full schedule with over 3,000 daily flights delivering industry-leading low fares, choice, reliability and 
customer service," said Dara Brady, Director of Marketing and Digital.
What about Blue Air?
Blue Air, has suspended all flights in response to the seizure of all its assets by the country's Ministry of 
Environment for not complying with financial regulations and failing to pay a US$2million fine. "Due to an 
unforeseen situation consisting in the seizure of all the accounts of the BlueAir company by the Ministry of the 
Wizz Air and Ryanair launch rescue flights for stranded Blue Air passengers
Environment for non-payment of a fine, the airline company BlueAir Aviation is forced, being unable to pay any 
supplier, to suspend all flights scheduled to depart from Romania," it said in a statement.

After Blue Air's decision to suspend operations left thousands of passengers stranded in airports across the world, 
rival airlines Hungarian low-cost carrier Wizz Air and Irish budget airline Ryanair rushed to fill the gap in the market 
by offering low-fare rescue flights.
Wizz Air launched a special webpage for stranded Blue Air passengers on September 7, 2022, the day after Blue 
Air suspended all its services. The Budapest-based airline also provided a special tariff for rescue flights, starting at 
around $49.
No stranger to rescue flights, Dublin-based Ryanair is offering low-fare tickets available until October 31, 2022. 
However, Ryanair implemented some purchase limitations with stranded passengers able to purchase low-fare 
tickets only until midnight on September 9, 2022.

Budget airlines' image has suffered - but Easyjet on flightpath to recovery
Budget airlines' image has suffered - but Easyjet on flightpath to recovery

HUNGARIAN no-frills airline Wizz Air was declared Britain's most-delayed carrier on the basis of Civil Aviation 
Authority data last month.
Perhaps more surprising, however, was fellow budget carriers Easyjet and Ryanair beating a host of flag carriers 
when it came to punctuality at British airports last year.
So in the battle of budget, who is performing best in consumers' eyes this summer? Well, it's been a tough season 
for all airlines - and that's reflected in the consumer data we've collected for these three brands in our brand 
tracking tool, BrandIndex.
Ryanair struggles to impress consumers at the best of times, and even its recent punctuality record hasn't changed 
that. Its brand health metric, Index (made up of its daily Impression, Value, Quality, Satisfaction and Recommend 
scores), has tracked consistently in the minus figures over the last quarter and shows only modest signs of 
improvement as the airport experience settles down.
Competitor Easyjet was the only airline of the three to begin the quarter with a positive Index score but the brand 
took a hit as trips were cancelled and delays built up (one of our recent polls showed that more than one in two 
travellers have flight faced delays this year). Its Index score hasn't exactly dive-bombed but it has descended gently 
from a height of 3.3 at the start of the quarter to 2.8 by its end - all via a significant dip in June.
Sandwiched between these two better known budget brands is our least punctual - Wizz Air. Its brand health score 
has fallen off by 3.7 points over the last quarter, placing it more firmly in negative territory.
Budget airlines' image has suffered - but Easyjet on flightpath to recovery
The summer delays won't have helped any of these brands - but of the three, it's Ryanair and Wizz Air who face 
longer-term perception issues. Easyjet will be hoping that, with capacity issues on their way to being dealt with, 
cheap can also mean cheerful once more.

Low-fare carrier, Ryanair, is set to close its Athens base for the winter season 2022/23, starting October 29th. The 
reasons given for this stated that it was due to the airport's 'dysfunctional' charging structure, which favoured 
German operators.
"Athens Airport is a prime example of how the Greek government and German high-cost ownership is failing to 
deliver for Greece's people and economy," said Ryanair's CEO, Eddie Wilson.
This is a blow to Ryanair's previously outlined ambitious growth plans, as the Greek government has failed to lower 
its airport charges and assist traffic post-COVID recovery (as Croatia and Portugal have done, amongst others).
"This failure of engagement by the Greek government has already led to Ryanair's closure of our Rhodes base this 
summer and has now forced us to close our Athens base this October and reallocate this capacity to lower cost 
competing destinations, such as Italy, Spain Cyprus and Portugal," he added.

Sep 05, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 The uptick in air-travel demand bodes well for Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1]. However, escalated fuel costs, a 
primary headwind, are limiting its bottom-line growth. Factors Favoring RYAAY The improvement in air-travel 
demand following the easing of COVID-related restrictions is a huge boon for Ryanair, which currently carries a 
Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In first-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Jun 30, 2022), the number of passengers who flew on 
RYAAY planes were 45.5 million, up 461% year over year. Air traffic in the quarter was 9% more than the pre-
COVID levels. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) was 92% compared with 73% a year ago. 
Continuing the trend, the number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in August registered a record figure. In 
fact, this was the fourth successive month wherein passenger volume touched the maximum at RYAAY. 
In August 2022, RYAAY flew 16.9 million passengers compared with 11.1 million passengers transported by 
RYAAY last August. Load factor increased to 96% from 82% in August 2021. The number of passengers attracted 
by RYAAY in August 2022 was 14.2% higher than the 14.9 million passengers flown in August 2019 (pre-
coronavirus era). Ryanair aims to increase its traffic in fiscal 2023 to 165 million, indicating 11% growth from the 
pre-COVID traffic numbers. 
Ryanair's measures to expand its fleet to cater to the improvement in travel demand are encouraging. Efforts to 
lower its debt levels are commendable too. Net debt at RYAAY declined to €0.4 billion at the end of the first quarter 
of fiscal 2023 from €1.45 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Key Risks Escalating fuel costs pose 
a threat to Ryan Air's bottom line. In the fiscal first quarter, operating costs surged 250% year over year, induced by 
a 560% increase in fuel expenses. Moreover, low average fares amid coronavirus concerns might hurt the airline's 
top line. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, average fares at RYAAY declined 4% year over year due to 
coronavirus-led woes and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in the 
ZacksTransportation [2]sector areSkyWestSKYW[3],GATX CorporationGATX[4] andC.H. RobinsonCHRW[5] . 
Continued recovery in air-travel demand bodes well for SkyWest. With better air-travel demand, SKYW carried 
32.7% more passengers in first-half 2022 than the year-ago level. As a result, the passenger load factor 
(percentage of seats filled by passengers) expanded 1450 basis points to 82.1% in first-half 2022. 
SKYW's fleet-modernization efforts are commendable as well. The bullishness surrounding the stock is evident 
from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised above 100% upward over the past 60 
days. SkyWest has aMomentum Style Score[6]of B. SKYW currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). 
Here's Why You Should Keep Ryanair (RYAAY) in Your Portfolio
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[7]. 
Based in Chicago, IL, GATX is a global railcar lessor with owned fleets in North America, Europe and Asia. 
Improvement in the North American railcar leasing market is expected to continue driving its growth. 
Shares of GATX have gained 6% in a year's time. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GATX's 2022 earnings has 
been revised 2.1% upward in the past 60 days. GATX currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). 
C.H. Robinson is being aided by an improving freight scenario in the United States. Efforts to control costs also 
bode well. Measures to reward CHRW's shareholders instill confidence in the stock further. 
CHRW has a pleasant earnings track record. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of 
the trailing four quarters (missing the mark in the remaining one). The stock has witnessed the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate for 2022 earnings being revised 17.6% upward over the past 60 days. C.H. Robinson currently carries a 
Zacks Rank of 2.

FTSE 100 closes firmly higher after US jobs rept  
•
US non-farm payrolls rose 315,000 in August  
•
G7 finance ministers agree to Russian oil price cap
4.47pm: FTSE closes higher
The FTSE 100 closed higher on Friday, bouncing back from yesterday's decline, as traders on both sides of the 
Pond appeared to welcome the US monthly jobs report.
Britain's blue-chip index finished the day up around 132 points, or 1.86%, at 7,281.
The report for August showed a robust US labour market, adding 315,000 more jobs, and signs that the Federal 
Reserve's tightening policy was having an effect. 
The jobless rate increased to 3.7% compared to 3.5% the month before but is still near a 50-year low.
"Another bout of Friday volatility has swept over financial markets from the US, with the latest jobs report helping to 
reverse some of the damage done by Jerome Powell last week," noted Joshua Mahony, a senior market analyst at 
online trading firm IG, in a note to clients.
"While many have questioned whether this raft of employment data had the ability to shift markets in the face of an 
inflation-focused Federal Reserve, the jump in unemployment and lower-than-expected wage growth figure did help 
ease market concerns."
FTSE 100 closes higher as traders both side of the Pond digest US jobs report
But big investment banks said the data had not changed their view that the Fed will continue to hike rates.
"We continue to expect the Fed to hike by 50bp in September and November. This report contained enough good 
news for the Fed," said Bank of America.
Citigroup said: "it does not substantially change the narrative for the Fed: inflation is too high and the labor market 
is too tight. We continue to expect a 75bp rate hike at the September FOMC meeting". 
3.35pm: FTSE ahead
Blue chip stocks looked set to end the week on a more upbeat note following a torrid week supported by gains 
across the pond.
At 3.40pm the lead index was trading up 122.14 points at 7,270.64, its best levels for the day with the broader 
FTSE 250 up 279.24 points at 18,772.98.
Solid US non-farm payrolls figures, combined with below forecast average earnings numbers gave hope that wage 
inflation had peaked without the detriment of a slowing jobs market.
The strong open in the US markets helped support shares in the UK's most popular investment trust, Scottish 
Mortgage Investment Trust PLC.
Shares rose by 3% in the investment trust managed by Baillie Gifford, which has a number of large holdings in US 
companies such as Moderna, Tesla and Amazon.com amongst others.
2.45pm: FTSE close to session highs as US makes positive start
The FTSE 100 was close to session highs following in line non-farm payrolls figures today which helped push US 
stocks higher at the open.
At 2.45pm the lead index was trading 104.82 points to the good at 7,253.32 with the broader FTSE 250 index up 
266.48 points at 18,760.22.
Just after the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had added 255 points or 0.8% at 31,911 points, the S&P 500 
was up 38 points or 1% at 4,005 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 94 points or 0.8% at 11,879 points.
Titan Asset Management chief investment officer John Leiper commented that the non-farm payroll data had taken 
on greater importance this week in the wake of Jerome Powell's Jackson Hole speech.
"Bottom line, these are positive numbers but will do little to change the 75 basis point versus 50 basis point rate 
hike," he said. "All eyes now turn to the next US inflation print on September 13th."
Monex Europe head of FX analysis Simon Harvey said August's payroll report was seen as disappointing on the 
whole, as the market's expectations were largely set higher than analysts' following yesterday's ISM report that 
showed firms' hiring intentions increased over the past month.
"With economic conditions likely forcing more economically inactive individuals back into the labour market, today's 
report suggests that downward pressure may soon start to be exerted on historically high wage growth," Harvey 
said.
"Should this occur in subsequent labour market reports, it will ease the emphasis on the Fed to aggressively tighten 
policy, as they currently wish to reduce labour demand to diminish its effects on wage growth in a historically tight 
labour market, and in turn, the persistence of inflation."
2.25pm: Non-farm payrolls "good news"
FTSE 100 closes higher as traders both side of the Pond digest US jobs report
John Leiper, chief investment officer at Titan Asset Management, said today's US jobs data was "good news" with 
new payrolls slightly above expectations.
"Further, more people have rejoined the workforce and as a result wage growth came in lower than expected with 
average hourly earnings at 0.3% versus 0.5% in July" he added.
"That's higher than policy makers will be comfortable with but is moving in the right direction and plays into an 
emerging narrative that labour-driven inflation may be peaking" he said.
"Bottom line, these are positive numbers but will do little to change the 75bp versus 50bps rate hike. All eyes now 
turn to the next US inflation print on September 13th" Leiper concluded.
2.15pm: G7 agrees Russian oil price cap
Finance ministers from the Group of Seven advanced economies have agreed to implement a price cap on Russian 
crude oil and petroleum products.
G7 ministers have confirmed the decision in a joint statement.
The initial price cap will be based on range of technical inputs and the price level will be revisited as necessary, said 
the ministers, adding:
"We aim to align implementation with the timeline of related measures within the EU´s sixth sanctions package" the 
statement said.
1.55pm: US jobs market remains strong
August's non-farm payroll rose by 315,000, a slowdown from July when there were 526,000 new hires, but still 
slightly better than market expectations for an increase of 300,000 new hires.
There were "notable job gains" in America's professional and business services, health care, and retail trade last 
month, says the Bureau for Labour Statistics.
The labour participation rate rose by 0.3 percentage points to 62.4% although the unemployment rate ticked up to 
3.7% from 3.5% in July.
Average hourly earnings increased 0.3% in August , below expectations..
1.30pm: UBS expects US interest rates to increase by 100 bps by the end of the year
UBS chief investment officer Mark Haefele said "The pullback in equities, which remain above the June lows, and 
the rise in yields are in line with our view that investors had underestimated the willingness of central banks to 
tighten policy at current rates of inflation."
With the US labour market seen as remaining resilient, he added: "We maintain our view that the Fed will raise 
rates by a further 100bps by year-end, with risks for more if inflation does not slow in line with our forecasts."
"With rates likely to stay higher for longer, our base case is for further volatility, earnings downgrades, and higher-
than-expected default rates over the course of next year."
UBS has a price target for the S&P 500 in June 2023 of 4,200, versus 3,955 as of Thursday's close.
"Uncertainty remains high over the path of inflation, energy prices, the war in Ukraine, and economic policy in 
China, so investors should remain alert to the risk of more adverse scenarios."
"We see this as a time to be selective in equities."

UBS favours tilting equity portfolios toward defensives and quality, which are more resilient in periods of weaker 
growth and elevated market volatility, he said.
"Investors should also consider the opportunity cost of sitting on the sidelines" he commented noting that "after a 
significant derating over the past year, the S&P 500 is now trading on a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 18.7x."
"Based on historical data, a trailing P/E of 18.7x on the S&P 500 has been consistent with annualized returns in the 
7-10% range over the next decade" he pointed out.
"This is a significant improvement versus end-2021, when a trailing P/E of 24.4x was consistent with subsequent 
returns in the 1-4% range."
"Bond yields are at their highest levels since the global financial crisis" he noted, adding that "historically, the 
starting level of yields has provided a good guide to future returns, suggesting that the outlook now is much 
stronger than it has been for most of the post-global financial crisis era."
12.50pm: ONS looks at how consumers responded to fuel price rises
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has for the first time looked at how consumers have reacted to rising fuel 
prices amid the cost of living squeeze.
The rise in fuel prices unsurprisingly coincided with a fall in fuel per transaction with the ONS noting that automotive 
fuel prices peaked at 48% above the previous year in July 2022, while fuel demanded per transaction dipped 6% 
over the same period.
Total automotive fuel sales growth has fallen 48 percentage points since the start of the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine in March 2022 to the end of July, with the number of adults who are facing cost-of-living increases who 
have cut back on non-essential vehicle travel during this period increasing by 14 percentage points.
Consumers bought 6% more fuel per transaction in the week ending 27 February (the week of the Russian invasion 
of Ukraine) compared to the same week in the previous year, up 7 percentage points from the week prior, possibly 
indicating consumers anticipating future fuel price increases or shortages amidst wider factors impacting oil prices.
Consumers also bought 7% more fuel per transaction than the previous year in response to the September 2021 
UK fuel distribution driver shortage, up 13 percentage points from the week prior, as a form of short-term 
stockpiling.
12.25pm: Top 10 worst performing funds highlighted
The reputation of some of the City's top stock pickers took a blow after a report showed the top ten worst 
performing big City funds have lost investors £10bn since Christmas.
The research, carried out by SCM Direct for the Evening Standard showed that the worst funds are down more than 
40% compared to a 4% fall in the FTSE 100, again calling into question their worth when compared to market 
tracking funds.
SCM Direct singled out the ten worst funds that are more than £1bn in size with Baillie Gifford, in the unenviable 
position of running four of the 10 fund flops.
The Evening Standard quoted Baillie Gifford director James Budden as saying "Following an 18-month period when 
many of our funds performed exceptionally well, the past 12 months have seen considerable market volatility largely 
driven by the change in the inflation and interest rate outlook, which has hit, often indiscriminately, the share prices 
of growth companies held in our portfolios despite many of these companies performing well operationally."
"Although we must acknowledge that recent volatility has been painful for investors, we seek their patience and ask 
to be judged on a five or even ten-year view."
FTSE 100 closes higher as traders both side of the Pond digest US jobs report
The 10 underperforming funds have £20bn invested in them and have lost a combined £10bn for investors so far in 
2022. The average return of these funds was -33.6% which compared with an average return of -8.6% for the 231 
funds analysed.
Alan Miller at SCM Direct said: "What is particularly interesting is that four of the bottom 10 funds came from Baillie 
Gifford. Many of these funds performed very well until markets and many of the jam tomorrow stocks crashed in 
2022, but it was not just this. It's the sky-high valuation of the stocks, not the sectors the stocks are in."
Some of the stocks that the funds invested in were Zoom, Tesla and Roku which have fallen by 56%, 19% and 71% 
respectively so far this year.
11.45am: FTSE firmer, US futures flat ahead of non-farm payrolls
Shares in London remained higher, although best levels for the day as investors switched attention across the pond 
with the US non-farm payrolls figures due out at 1.30pm UK time.
At 11.45am the FTSE 100 was trading 41.00 points higher at 7,189.50 with the broader FTSE 250 up 126.64 at 
18,620.38.
Ahead of those numbers US futures were pointing to a subdued open with futures for the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average trading 0.1% higher pre-market, while those for the broader S&P 500 index were also up 0.1%, with 
futures for the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 flat.
As things stand, US rate-setters have indicated that they will stick to an aggressive path of interest rate hikes and a 
strong payroll number will solidify expectations of another 75-basis-point increase at the upcoming rate-setting 
meeting, a factor that continues to weigh on equities.
"All eyes are on the US jobs data today - the US is expected to have added around 300,000 new nonfarm jobs in 
August," Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank said, noting that "another strong NFP print will 
guarantee a 75bp hike in FOMC's September meeting."  
The continued strength of the labor market has been a key factor in the Federal Reserve's pursuit of higher interest 
rates as it fights to tackle runaway inflation which is still hovering around 40-year highs. Over recent months, non-
farm payrolls have risen rapidly, often surpassing expectations, suggesting that the wider economy can withstand 
aggressive interest rate hikes although many watchers still fear that the US will slip into a recession.
"Presently, investors are braced for another strong NFP read, and activity on fed funds futures gives around 75% 
chance for a 75bp hike in September. We could see this probability spike higher in case of strong NFP data - which 
would mean higher US yields, a further advance in the US dollar, and some more negative pressure on stock 
valuations," noted Ozkardeskaya.
"But, if today's NFP print is in line or ideally softer-than-expected - as the Federal Reserve would like it to be, then 
we could see a certain relief in the US yields, a rebound in equity markets and hopefully a downside correction in 
the dollar before the weekly closing bell," she added. 
Some sections of the markets are hoping for a softer reading after Wednesday's ADP private sector jobs report for 
August showed payrolls grew by just 132,000, lower than the 268,000 jobs added in July and below the 300,000 
increase that analysts were expecting for the month.
Elsewhere, news of COVID-19-related lockdowns in China was also weighing on market sentiment as investors 
worry about a slowdown in economic activity.
Separately, shares in chipmaker Nvidia Corp are expected to remain under pressure, having dropped around 7% 
yesterday, after the US said the tech firm may not be able to sell some processors to China without special 
licenses.
FTSE 100 closes higher as traders both side of the Pond digest US jobs report
The latest US economic data helped push the US dollar index to a 20-year high with commentators pointing out that 
the resilient numbers give the Federal Reserve more room to aggressively increase interest rates in their battle to 
stem inflation.
The US dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, rose 0.9% to 109.68, its 
highest since June 2002.
The US currency firmed after a government report showed that the number of Americans filing new claims for 
unemployment benefits declined further last week, consistent with strong demand for workers and tight labour 
market conditions.
Further indications as to the strength of the US jobs market will come later today with non-farm payrolls figures due 
out.
Data from the Institute for Supply Management showed US manufacturing grew steadily in August as employment 
and new orders rebounded, while a further easing in price pressures strengthened expectations that inflation has 
likely peaked.
10.10am: Passenger numbers taking off at Ryanair.
Ryanair reported a 52% annual increase in passenger numbers in August 2022 to 16.9mln from 11.1mln in August 
2021 today.
The load factor also jumped to 96% from 82% a year before and the group said it operated over 92,800 flights in 
August.
Victoria Scholar, head of investment, interactive investor said "Ryanair enjoyed its fourth consecutive month of 
record passenger numbers in August" with "around 3,000 flights per day last week versus 1,600 flights for rival 
easyJet." 
"It has been a difficult year for the airline industry with the war in Ukraine, the surge in oil prices, the cost-of-living 
crisis, the disruption at airports and months of staff strikes."
"However for Ryanair, the post-pandemic release of pent-up demand for summer holidays has outweighed the 
headwinds with the Irish airline manage to score stellar passenger figures and a near maximum load factor."
9.35am: Shell CEO to step down - Reuters
Following yesterday's surprise departure of Reckitt Benckiser chief executive Laxman Narasimhan, it looks as if 
another FTSE 100 company is poised for a change at the top as Shell's Ben van Beurden is reportedly preparing to 
step down.
Reuters reported that Shell PLC has shortlisted four candidates to succeed van Beurden who it says is preparing to 
step down next year after nearly a decade at the helm of the energy giant.
AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said ""A key feature of his near decade at the helm has been a focus on 
natural gas, including the big acquisition of BG Group in 2016."
 "Arguably this strategy has been vindicated by recent events which have revealed the importance of gas for energy 
security and as a way of transitioning from more polluting fuels to renewables."
 "While there has been considerable volatility in the interim, ultimately since van Beurden took over at the beginning 
of 2014 he has delivered a total return to shareholders of 45.1%."
 "Given this period encompassed an oil price crash very early in his tenure and a global pandemic, this is not too 
shabby" Mould commented.
FTSE 100 closes higher as traders both side of the Pond digest US jobs report
 "His successor faces a tough task though, with regulatory pressure likely to be a key theme. Internal appointments 
are rumoured to be in the running, befitting an organisation which has often looked inwards when planning a 
succession process."
"Whoever prevails will have to balance the demands of the environmental lobby, governments and investors" Mould 
said, adding "at least van Beurden spared them the decision of cutting the dividend, a step taken for the first time 
since the Second World War in 2020."
8.55am: Housebuilders under pressure from HSBC downgrades
The FTSE 100 advanced in early trading although gains were limited by a broad markdown in housebuilders 
following negative comments by HSBC today.
At 8.55am the blue chip index was trading 33.52 points higher at 7,182.02 and the FTSE 250 was 87.92 points 
higher at 18,581.66.
Oil stocks, and index heavyweights, BP PLC and Shell PLC, provided some support following a bounce in the oil 
price but housebuilders were a weak feature following downgrades in the sector by HSBC which has cut ratings on 
Barratt Developments, Bellway, Persimmon, and Berkeley amongst others.
Victoria Scholar, head of investment, interactive investor says, "The UK housebuilders like Berkeley Group, Barratt 
Developments, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey are languishing at the bottom of the FTSE 100 after HSBC issued a 
pessimistic update on the sector."
"The analyst team downgraded Berkeley Group to a sell from the hold, slashing its price target from 4280p to 
3220p, sending shares down by more than 5%."
"Meanwhile it downgraded other stocks in the sector from a buy to a hold, also sending shares lower" she noted.
"The prospect of a looming recession, tentative signs that the housing market is starting to cool, rising interest rates 
for the Bank of England and build cost inflation have created a hostile environment for investors, who are 
eschewing the sector, despite the imbalance between supply and demand in the market."
"It has been a tough year for the sector with Berkeley Group down by around 30% from the highs in 2021 as the 
buy case becomes less and less compelling from the analysts."
8.35am: Oil price bounces after recent weakness
The oil price rose slightly today, following recent falls, with the market likely to remain sensitive ahead of next 
Monday's OPEC meeting, according to analysts..
Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said:
"Brent crude has risen to $93 per barrel, but this is still a sharp contraction of recent pricing - and 30% off this year's 
high."
"The value of the black stuff is slipping away because of tighter monetary policy and new Covid lockdowns in China, 
which has changed the demand profile."
"This comes at the same time as work being done on the Iran nuclear deal, which reduces concerns around 
supply."
"The market is likely to remain highly sensitive to next Monday's OPEC+ deal, which will decide on production 
policy."
FTSE 100 closes higher as traders both side of the Pond digest US jobs report
"An about-turn in existing agreements is unlikely to be triggered, but it's something to monitor nonetheless, with 
supply and demand concerns both rearing their heads, exactly where the market will settle is tough to predict. At 
least for consumers, the trajectory is currently a downwards one."
Shares in BP PLC and Shell PLC both rose today reflecting the oil price increase.
8.10am: Footsie opens high on Friday
FTSE 100 opened higher on Friday after a torrid week with late gains in the US providing support.
At 8.05am the blue chip index was trading up 21.44 points at 7,171.83 with the FTSE 250 up 79.81 at 18,573.55.
Shares in Alliance Pharma PLC (AIM:APH) fell 10% in early trading after it said that the Competition and Markets 
Authority intends to disqualify seven directors from four companies, including Alliance Pharma, chief executive, 
Peter Butterfield.
Alliance said it "fundamentally disagrees with the CMA's actions, both in relation to the findings against the 
Company and in applying for a CDO against Mr. Butterfield." 
Asset manager Ashmore Group PLC said on Friday that assets under management and earnings slipped in the 
twelve months to June as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and inflationary concerns led to widespread risk aversion.
Assets under management declined by 32% year-on-year to $64.0bn, with the majority of the movement 
attributable to a negative investment performance of $16.6bn and net outflows of $13.5bn.
The FTSE 250-listed group also said reported EBITDA had fallen from £195.7mln in 2020-21 to £122.3m twelve 
months later, while reported operating profits dropped from £192.9mln to £119.2mln.
Ryanair reported a 52% annual increase in passenger numbers in August 2022 to 16.9mln from 11.1mln in August 
2021 today.
The load factor also jumped to 96% from 82% a year before and the group said it operated over 92,800 flights in 
August.
The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it expects the UK economy to head into recession before the end of 
2022, with inflation spiking to 14% and lingering weakness in growth expected to continue into 2024.
It has reduced its expectations for UK GDP growth for 2022 to 3.3% (from 3.5% in quarter two) against a 
deteriorating economic outlook.
The BCC said it now expects negative economic growth from quarter two of this year through to quarter four.
It does expect the economy to grow marginally in 2023, by 0.2%, and by 1% in 2024.
"These anaemic predictions for GDP growth are in light of deteriorating economic conditions; rising energy costs, a 
decline in household spending and real wages; weaker export prospects and a pessimistic global economic outlook; 
poor investment conditions and weakening business confidence and cashflow" the BCC said.
"Many of these issues were initially caused by the global response to Covid-19 and have been further compounded 
by the war in Ukraine."
The BCC said it expects inflation to peak at 14%, fall to 5% in 2023 and finally return to the Bank of England's 
target of 2% in 2024.
7.25am: FTSE seen higher, US non-farm payrolls due later
FTSE 100 closes higher as traders both side of the Pond digest US jobs report
Trading in London is expected to get off to a positive start on Friday after a week of hefty losses in the UK equity 
market.
Spread betting companies are calling the FTSE 100 up by around 30 points.
Michael Hewson chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK noted "It's been almost a week since Powell's comments 
at Jackson Hole, and it's been one way traffic ever since" although "last night's close in the US did see a rebound 
off the lows of the day with the Dow and S&P500 both managing to eke out a modest gain. This late rebound 
should translate into a positive European open."
"Against this backdrop of economic weakness and the determination of central banks to prioritise inflation over 
growth, it's a tough backdrop for stock markets" Hewson commented.
"Today's US payrolls report has the potential to add another layer to the US dollar strength narrative, as well as 
equity market weakness in the event we get another strong number this afternoon."
"The resilience of the US labour market has been a notable standout when it comes to US economic data this 
year."
"The last three payrolls' reports have seen the headline numbers beat expectations. Wage growth has also proved 
to be resilient even as vacancy rates are still close to record levels."
"Another positive payroll number today would in all probability rubber stamp the possibility of a 75bps rate hike 
when the US Federal Reserve next meets later this month" Hewson stated.
"Expectations are for 298,000 jobs to be added, however given how much forecasts missed in July, one has to 
question how reliable these estimates are likely to be."
6.55am: FTSE set to open higher
FTSE 100 is expected to open higher on Friday following a late rally in the US on Thursday although investors will 
be cautiously awaiting US non-farm payrolls figures later today.
Another positive payroll number today would in all probability rubber stamp the possibility of a 75bps rate hike when 
the US Federal Reserve next meets later this month.
Spread betting companies are calling the lead index up by around 30 points.
In the US the Dow closed Thursday up 146 points, 0.5%, at 31,656, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 31 points, 
0.3%, to 11,785 and the S&P 500 added 12 points, 0.3%, to 3,967.
The benchmarks all appeared on pace for their fifth-straight day of losses but gradually climbed in afternoon 
trading. 
The question going forward is whether markets in September will get as low as they did in June, according to John 
Lynch, chief investment officer at Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Wealth Management.
"The June lows are in play in the coming weeks as equity investors finally recognize the intensity of the Fed's 
mission," Lynch said, as reported by CNBC. "Inflation and recession are typically accompanied by lower market 
multiples and markets need to reassess valuation as interest rates rise."

 European stocks rose 2% on Friday, clocking gains for the first time in six days after key U.S. jobs data eased bets 
of a more aggressive Federal Reserve, but logged their third straight week of falls on concerns over a spike in 
energy prices. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 2.0%, but clocked a weekly decline of 2%.  
Data showed U.S. employers hired more workers than expected in August, but moderate wage growth and a rise in 
the unemployment rate could ease pressure on the Fed to deliver a third 75 basis point interest rate hike this 
month. 
"If wage growth continues to moderate along with prices for goods and services the Fed may find a window to ease 
back on the pace of hiking, an event that would surely set up a relief rally in equities," said Peter Essele, head of 
portfolio management at Commonwealth Financial Network.  
Investors sharply raised bets this week on a large 75 bps rate hike from the European Central Bank at its meeting 
next Thursday following hawkish commentary from policymakers and another record high inflation print in August. 
[GVD/EUR] 
Money markets priced in an 80% chance of a 75 bps hike at the meeting, compared with less than 50% last Friday, 
per Refinitiv data. 
Flows of Russian gas via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany remained at zero on Friday morning after Russia's 
Gazprom halted supplies for a three-day maintenance outage on Aug. 31.  
"I think the global economy, especially the European economy, remains hostage to what Russia decides to do with 
gas flows, at least for this coming winter. We just have to brace for more potential trouble coming that way from 
Russia," said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard based in London. 
Credit Suisse rose 6.1% following reports that Switzerland's second-biggest bank is considering cutting around 
5,000 jobs in a cost-reduction drive.  
Ryanair firmed 2.0% as the Irish low-cost carrier saw a record number of passengers in August for the fourth 
straight month.  
Philips slumped to its lowest level since July 2012 after a subsidiary of the Dutch medical device maker agreed to

Ryanair flies record 17mln passengers in August
Ryanair flies record 17mln passengers in August

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) reported record passenger numbers in August despite airport disruptions, 
keeping to its goal to grow faster in a recession.
Nearly 17mln people flew with the airline last month, more than its pre-Covid peak of almost 15mln in the same 
month of 2019 and way more than 11mln in 2021.
It was a fourth consecutive month of record traffic.
In order to be prepared for the surge in demand for travel once lockdown restrictions were lifted, the company 
trained its staff throughout the pandemic.
As Heathrow airport attempted to minimise short-notice cancellations by capping the number of flights, Ryanair 
increased departures at Stansted airport, its main hub in London.
Heathrow has extended the cap to October end.
Ryanair's chief Michael O'Leary has been increasing the airline's capacity as shrinking travel budgets lead people 
to its low-fare business model.
It will likely beat pre-pandemic levels of passengers this year as it recently announced its biggest ever winter 
schedule to and from the UK, although the airline is also facing strikes by its Spanish workforce.

JET2's summer sale seat capacity was 14 per cent higher than 2019 levels as the travel giant reaped the benefits 
of the post-pandemic travel rush.
During Jet2's AGM yesterday, executive chairman Philip Meeson told shareholders that while there was a "difficult 
return to normal operations" at the start of the summer, due to lack of planning and investment by many airports, 
this had "abated significantly".
Nonetheless, average load factors for Jet2 were still 1.4 per cent behind summer 2019, as some travellers 
continued to opt for staycations over airports. The firm said winter 2022/23 forward bookings were "satisfactory", 
with average load factors matching 2019 figures.
Meeson added that package holiday customers continued to display a materially higher mix of the total departing 
passengers, up 13 per cent this summer.
Meeson remained confident that the appeal of package holidays would remain robust as cost of living pressures hit 
consumers.
The airline said it was on track to achieve current market expectations for full year profit. The carrier is due to report 
its interim results at the end of November.
Meeson's comments came after Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said on Tuesday people will shy away from 
expensive fares, trading down to the benefit of the low-cost carrier.

Jet2 PLC (AIM:JET2) (Jet2 PLC (AIM:JET2)) said that winter bookings this year were "satisfactory" and it remains 
on track to achieve the current market expectations on profit for the year.
Executive chairman Philip Meeson told shareholders that load factors are matching those of winter 2019/20, the last 
pre-Covid trading year.
Additionally, the group said it continues to benefit from significant investment in preparation for the summer period 
just gone, which allowed it to retain its employees and enabled its sale seat capacity for the season to be 14% 
higher than the same period in 2019.
Customer bookings have also remained "consistently strong," as Jet2 notes the early summer chaos which led to 
airlines and airports mass cancelling flights at the last minute has "abated significantly."
John Strickland, a director at airline consulting firm JLS Consulting believes that this winter, however, brings "more 
uncertainties than normal."
"Winter is typically the down season in which most airlines lose money due to lower traffic volumes," Strickland 
said. 
"There are exceptions such as warmer southern Mediterranean destinations such as the Canaries to which most of 
the Low-Cost carriers are exposed." 
Jet2 confident about winter, but what about the other budget airlines?
"This winter there are more uncertainties than normal with the upcoming shock to consumers' budgets from rising 
gas bills and overall inflation."
However, how this impacts each of the budget airlines varies on a case-by-case basis.
According to Strickland, "Ryanair has the financial muscle to price low due to a good hedging position."
EasyJet and Jet2 "both have in-house holiday arms to appeal to price sensitive customers with all in package 
offers."
One airline that may struggle, is Wizz Air.
"Whilst having low overall costs, (Wizz) is less well placed due to its decision to withhold until recently from 
hedging."
"It needs to compete on price but doing so is likely to translate into larger losses during the winter months because 
of this handicap."

VAS Aero Services, an aviation logistics and aftermarket services provider, has acquired six managed Airbus A320 
aircraft from Genesis Aircraft Leasing Services.
The A320s were manufactured in 2001-2002, Airfinance Journal's Fleet Tracker shows, and have been operated by 
LATAM.
The airframes will be allocated for teardown and the surplus parts staged in the United States, United Kingdom and 
Europe for distribution through VAS's aftermarket network to its airline customers.
Last week, Airfinance Journal reported that Genesis had extended A320 leases with both American Airlines and 
Ryanair subsidiary Lauda Europe, highlighting renewed demand for its current-technology narrowbody aircraft.
The lessor said this was driven by ongoing delays to new aircraft deliveries and rising interest rates.

Europe's largest budget airline Ryanair could be in a good position going forward, as passengers trade down to 
low-cost services, according to chief executive officer Michael O'Leary.
Although the airline has yet to provide concrete profit guidance for the financial year ending in March 2023, Ryanair 
will likely beat pre-pandemic levels of passengers this year as travellers gravitate towards budget services.
But while the Ryanair boss is hopeful, he told Reuters that he's "not certain of returning to pre-Covid profit levels of 
over (EURO)1bn (£860mln)".
O'Leary is not so optimistic about Europe's wider short-haul aviation market though, given the plethora of grim 
macro pressures from rising fuel and staffing costs to recession fears and the Ukraine invasion.
"I think that the overall market will not in 2023, 2024, return to pre-COVID traffic levels," he told a news conference 
on Tuesday, before stating that Ryanair "will grow stronger in a recession as we have in every other recession 
heretofore".
Fares are likely to increase by 3-4% this year and another 3-5% the year after according to O'Leary.
O'Leary signalled an end to (EURO)10 flights earlier this month, stating that average fares on the Irish budget 
carrier would rise to roughly (EURO)50 (£42.90) over the next five years.
Regardless, Ryanair did just add more than one million low-fare seats to its winter schedule just as British Airways 
was raking up the cancellations.

Michael O'Leary, CEO of Irish low-cost airline Ryanair, said he didn't expect Boeing to certify its 737 MAX 10 this 
year. O'Leary also said U.S. lawmakers may give the airplane maker more time to receive approval for the new 
aircraft, Reuters reported.
Ryanair is a Boeing customer that's now negotiating a big order of MAX 10s, which can carry 230 passengers. 
O'Leary will meet with Boeing on Wednesday to discuss the order, Reuters reported.
Boeing has until late December to win approval for the aircraft or it must comply with a 2020 law that requires new 
cockpit alerts. A waiver from Congress would give Boeing more time for the certification process.
The regulatory snags may force Boeing to cancel the Max 10, company CEO Dave Calhoun said in July.
"As we have said, we are working transparently with the FAA to provide the information they need, and are 
committed to meeting their expectations and those of our customers to certify and deliver the 737-10," Boeing said 
in an emailed statement after Seeking Alpha requested comment. "Safety remains the driving factor in this effort."
Boeing (BA) slipped 1.7% to $162.55 a share during Tuesday's session amid a broader selloff in stocks.

 Ryanair is hopeful but not certain of returning to pre-COVID profit levels of over 1 billion euros ($1 billion) this year 
as travelers trade down to low-cost services, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told Reuters on Tuesday.  
Last month the Irish airline, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, said it was too soon to provide meaningful 
profit guidance for its financial year, which ends on March 31, 2023. 
"Hopefully we'll get back to profitability of over a billion but (it's) not certain. Put it this way: we are doing our best," 
O'Leary told Reuters in an interview. 
"I'm hopeful. But again there is too much uncertainty this winter over Ukraine, and also the recession," he added. 
It is already certain that Ryanair will beat its pre-COVID peak of flying 149 million passengers in a year, with a 
forecast of 166.5 million for the current financial year.  
But O'Leary said high fuel prices, economic turmoil and staffing pressures meant that the wider European short-
haul market would not return to pre-COVID traffic levels in 2023 or 2024. 
"In a very dark deep recession as we've had in the past, the total market may level out or decline slightly but more 
and more people will trade down to lower cost airlines like Ryanair," he said.  
"There's every risk the economic situation this winter will cause people to fly less, but they won't cut flying 
altogether," he added.  
O'Leary said Ryanair was seeing stronger bookings going into the winter period - particularly at Christmas and in 
October for Britain's mid-term school break and Ireland's bank holiday weekend - than it had pre-pandemic.  
"We're seeing much stronger advance bookings at higher prices," he said.  
Average fares are likely to rise by 3-4% this year and 3-5% next year, O'Leary told a news conference ahead of the 
interview. The airline will have just 4% of seats empty on average in August, matching July's post-COVID record.  
Ryanair may continue to suffer minor industrial action, but will "work around this," O'Leary said.

Stansted passengers warned as airport staff vote on strikes
Stansted passengers warned as airport staff vote on strikes

Staff at London Stansted - one of the UK's busiest airports - are voting on strike action that could cause 
major disruption for passengers.
More than 1,000 workers including security staff, cleaners, maintenance staff, airport ambassadors and firefighters 
are taking part in the vote. It opened on 26 August and will end on 19 September when they will decide whether to 
go on strike or not.
Unite union says that strike action would cause "significant disruption" and "could even close the airport" because of 
the vital work carried out by the staff taking part in the vote.
Why might Stansted Airport workers strike?
During the pandemic, airport workers agreed to a year long 10 per cent pay cut. This was then extended by three 
months at short notice. Unite points out that pay during the same period for executives at Manchester Airport Group 
(MAG), the company which owns Stansted, increased by 23 per cent.
An initial offer of a 7.5 per cent pay increase and a one off £250 ((EURO)290) payment by MAG was 
overwhelmingly rejected by workers, the union adds.
"Stansted and MAG expected our members to make financial sacrifices during the pandemic and they expect them 
to do the same thing now during the cost-of-living crisis," says Unite general secretary Sharon Graham.
"Everyone is expected to tighten their belts except MAG's rich executives. Our members won't stand for it and they 
will receive Unite's full support in fighting for a fair pay rise."
Ryanair has just announced that it will be adding further 500 flights at Stansted this October as passenger numbers 
pick up, says Unite's regional coordinating officer Mark Robinson.
"It is abundantly clear that the company can afford to invest in its staff and make a substantially improved offer."
What does Stansted Airport have to say about the potential strikes?
Stansted passengers warned as airport staff vote on strikes
A spokesperson for Stansted Airport told Euronews Travel that they were "surprised and disappointed to learn Unite 
had chosen to ballot colleagues for strike action on the grounds they consider our latest pay offer to be 
unacceptable."
"This is the very same pay offer we agreed with Unite, and which it strongly recommended its members voted in 
favour of as recently as 20 July."
Stansted also shared a letter Unite reportedly sent to its members in July where the union stated that they "believe 
[they] reached the best possible outcome through negotiation".
"We remain fully committed to working with our unions to reach an agreement that recognises the hard work and 
dedication of our colleagues and maintains the financial stability of the airport after the extreme challenges we 
faced because of the pandemic and at a time when passenger levels are still measurably lower than they were in 
2019," the spokesperson added.
They said that Stansted will continue to speak to all staff at the airport - not just those represented by Unite, to talk 
through a fair and competitive offer.

Ryanair set to benefit as households tighten belts Airlines

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary expects the airline to lure passengers from more expensive rivals this 
winter as travellers tighten belts amid the economic slowdown. With households under pressure from soaring 
energy bills and inflation, the industry is preparing for a grim winter after summer disruption because of staff 
shortages.
O'Leary said the cost of living crisis would hit demand: passenger numbers across Europe would not return to 
prepandemic levels until 2025. "You would be crazy not to worry about the looming recession," he said yesterday. 
"A recession will significantly ... dampen the traffic recovery post-Covid."
But he said Ryanair would continue to grow "full steam ahead" regardless of the economic climate and UK inflation 
forecasts of nearly 20 per cent.
He expects Ryanair to benefit as customers have typically turned to lowercost airlines during recessions.
"Some people may travel less ... but what we see is far more people trading down to the lowest fare operator."
He said early bookings for this winter were ahead of 2019 levels, but suggested this was because passengers were 
switching to Ryanair as other airlines scaled back their plans. "While our recovery and growth is still very strong, it 
is still very fragile and prone to falling over," he said.

The carrier flew 15 per cent more flights this summer than in 2019, benefiting from airlines such as Norwegian 
downsizing in the pandemic, and rivals including British Airways cutting flight numbers because of staff shortages.
Ryanair expects to carry 166mn passengers in its current financial year to the end of March, up from 149.5mn in the 
full year before Covid-19. Its longterm target is to carry 225mn passenger by its 2026 financial year.

RYANAIR chief executive Michael O'Leary yesterday said the airline will grow stronger amid the UK's predicted 
recession.
The low-cost carrier said that people will not stop travelling altogether, but they will shy away from more expensive 
fares put forward by competitors.
"People in a recession will get much more price sensitive," O'Leary told reporters during a press conference in 
London yesterday. "We will see a much larger number of people trading down from British Airways and Easyjet."
To monetise on Brits' appetite for cheap travel, Ryanair announced it was adding 21 routes to its UK winter 
schedule. "As we continue to grow and add capacity in the UK, our customers have over 440 exciting winter sun, 
ski and city break destinations to choose from," he said.
Despite the difficult financial backdrop, Ryanair expects to come out on top also because it has hedged out its fuel 
costs until March next year at $64 per barrel - which is 40 per cent lower than current prices.
According to the aviation executive, Ryanair will be insulated while the rest of the industry remains behind pre-
pandemic traffic levels, at least until 2025.
Nevertheless, Ryanair will no longer be able to offer (EURO)10 fares due to hiking oil prices.
"I do think the (EURO)10.99 or 9.99 really cheap fares will probably be gone for the next couple of year while we're 
all dealing with this kind of much higher oil prices," he added.
Ryanair chief expects growth in tougher times
"While our recovery and growth are very strong, it is still very fragile and is prone to falling over in the face of 
adverse developments."
O'Leary called for changes to the UK's visa system to address staff shortages.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) will limit fuel hedging to roughly half of its requirements for fiscal 2024 due to the possibility of a

O'Leary told a news briefing that the airline group will hedge up to 50% of its fuel needs for the year ending March 
2024 at about $90 to $92 a barrel. The group previously hedged 80% of its fuel for fiscal 2023 at $63 per barrel.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) is "doing its best" to return to profitability of more than 1 billion euros ($1 billion) in 2022 after 
observing strong booking trends for the upcoming winter season, Reuters reported Tuesday.
In an interview, Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary said he is "hopeful" but remains wary of uncertainties over 
the Ukraine war and fears of recession. O'Leary also believes that Europe's short-haul market will not recover to 
pre-COVID-19 traffic levels in 2023 or 2024 due to high fuel costs, economic issues and staffing concerns. 
The budget airline expects to fly nearly 167 million passengers for the year, exceeding its pre-pandemic peak of 
149 million passengers.
Ryanair gained around 1% on Tuesday's close.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) told Reuters on Tuesday that Boeing (BOE.L, BOEI.BR) does not expect its Max 10 aircraft to be 
certified by the end of 2022 but is hopeful that US regulators will give the company more time.
Boeing is facing a deadline to win approval for the 737 Max 10 aircraft. If it fails to do so, it would be required to 
meet new cockpit alerting requirements under a law passed in 2020, unless the requirement is waived by the US 
Congress.
Ryanair is in talks with Boeing regarding a large potential order for Max 10 aircraft, according to the report.
Ryanair closed nearly 1% higher on Tuesday while Boeing was down almost 3%.

The Ryanair boss was on good form in London yesterday - and wasn't shy from an opinion or three...
ON HIS COMPETITION... We are the UK's most reliable airline [and] that is not setting the bar very high, as we are 
competing with BA and Easyjet.
ON HIS REPUTATION We were never pirates, we were always the good guys ON HIS FUTURE I have no thoughts 
on retirement, I have three teenage children, [no] four teenage children.
ON THE GOVERNMENT Personally, I would get rid of people like Priti Patel, who certainly is not capable of 
controlling anybody's border [while] Grant Shapps will be no loss in the transport sector.

Airlines are braced for a grim winter after struggling under the weight of booming demand for travel in the summer, 
as the economic slowdown threatens their recovery.
The dire outlook has prompted warnings that passenger numbers could fall as household disposable incomes come 
under pressure from high inflation and soaring energy bills.
Despite upgrading its passenger forecasts, Gatwick airport said uncertainty on the economy was a threat to an 
industry shaken by rising fuel costs and staff shortages. "It could impact the overall propensity for travel," said Jim 
Butler, Gatwick's finance chief.
Although airlines have not reported a significant hit to bookings, he was "cautious about what we might see in the 
winter or next year". While it might not hit many peoples' ability to take a big annual holiday, Butler said, it could 
weigh on demand for "the second or third trip".
One European airline executive said the "outlook is still very uncertain" for the winter, particularly as the end of the 
summer was never a strong booking period. He projected less demand for leisure travel in the fourth quarter, 
including a reduction in shorter city breaks.
It would mean a further blow to airlines and their shares, which have been under pressure even as demand surged 
in the summer with airports and carriers struggling. The MSCI index of European airline shares has lost 15 per cent 
Flight blight Inflation toll on personal income threatens to cancel airline sector recovery
this year, with groups including British Airways owner IAG, Ryanair and Air France-KLM down about 30 per cent. 
"There is a lot of negativity on airline stocks ... People are saying you don't usually buy airlines into a recession," 
said Stephen Furlong, an analyst at Davy.
The revenue of the seven airlines covered by Moody's in 2009 fell about 20 per cent in the recession that followed 
the financial crisis, and operating profit fell 50 per cent.
Furlong said the industry was in an unusual position, with a weakening economic outlook coinciding with pent-up 
demand that has not shown any signs of slowing down following two years of travel www.curbs.No big airline has 
publicly reported a slowdown in bookings. "People are hugely worried about the macro, and yet the numbers are 
really good," he said.
Bjørn Tore Larsen, chief executive of new Norwegian long-haul airline Norse Atlantic, said a recession would "of 
course" hit demand, but travel was still "very high on people's lists". He said in August: "I think many people would 
go for that weekend away, rather than buy a new TV."
Moody's said in a report that there was scope for airlines to recover more of their pre-pandemic business.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) Chief Executive Michael O'Leary expects the short-haul aviation market to remain below its pre-
COVID-19 levels during the next two years, Reuters reported Tuesday.
O'Leary said high energy costs and their economic impact would hinder market recovery but added that Ryanair will 
grow during a recession, as it did in previous recessions on the back of fuel hedging and low aircraft costs.
Shares of the low-cost carrier were up almost 2% on Tuesday afternoon.

Wizz Air was followed by Tui's average delay of 13 minutes and British Airways' 12 minutes.
Low-cost titans such as Easyjet and Ryanair performed better with Easyjet ranked second best, with a hold-up of 
four minutes, while Ryanair came in third.
Wizz Air did not respond to a request for www.comment.UK airlines have been hit by staff shortages in their own 
ranks as well as at airports this year as the aviation industry struggles to keep up with the swift take-off of post-
pandemic consumer demand.
Carriers have axed thousands of flights to improve reliability.

 Sibiu International Airport will open six new routes in the next period, with state aid worth over 2.2 million euros, the 
contribution being over 370,000 euros per route, over a period of three years, according to a decision adopted 
unanimously by the county councilors on Thursday."The maximum budget of the state aid scheme is EUR 
2,234,485.44, and the maximum contribution is EUR 372,414.24 per route for a period of three years. 
The state aid scheme will be valid until December 31, 2025, the date by which the Sibiu County Council and the 
Sibiu International Airport Autonomous Corporation will conclude financial aid contracts with the beneficiaries, 
based on a bid selection procedure to select the beneficiaries, until the scheme's budget is exhausted, and the 
subsidy can be paid until the end of 2028. The maximum number of potential beneficiaries of the scheme is six, 
considering the fact that the budget of the scheme was estimated taking as a reference a number of six new 
routes," the decision reads.Currently, the network of routes available from Sibiu International Airport directly 
connects the city of Sibiu with 18 destinations: Munich (flights operated by Lufthansa), Vienna (flights operated by 
Austrian Airlines), Stuttgart (flights operated by Blue Air), Dortmund, Frankfurt Hahn, Karlsruhe Baden-Baden, 
London Luton, Madrid, Memmingen, Nurnberg (flights operated by Wizz Air), Billund, Bologna, Brussels Charleroi, 
Corfu, Dublin, Liverpool, Milan Malpensa, Venice Treviso and Vienna (flights operated by Ryanair)."It is estimated 
that a number of 2,875,000 people live in the extended catchment area of the Sibiu airport, located at a maximum of 
120 minutes from the Sibiu airport, the market share that can be attracted by it is 1,311,000 inhabitants, 46% of the 
maximum potential," it is shown in the specialist report on the grounds of which the state aid for opening new routes 
at the Sibiu International Airport was granted.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) confirmed it had appealed to the courts of the European Union against a "baseless fine" 
Hungary imposed on it for passing on to consumers the cost of a new tax meant to target excess profits in some 
sectors of the economy.
The Irish carrier had already threatened to appeal to the courts earlier this month after the Hungarian Consumer 
Protection Agency (CPA) fined it HUF300 million forints (USD732,000) it for "deceiving consumers through unfair 
commercial practices" in relation to the tax, which levies EUR10 to EUR25 (USD10-25) per passenger departing 
Hungary. The airline also dropped eight routes from Budapest in protest at the tax.
The government of Hungary's nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, announced the special tax in May, to skim 
extra profits it claimed were being earned by banks, energy and telecoms firms, and airlines, among other 
companies, hoping to make up for additional spending that helped him win a fourth consecutive term in April.
Ryanair "has now appealed the unjustified fine," it said in a statement on August 24, "and is confident that the EU 
Courts will validate its decision to pass on this retrospective tax to passengers." This is because, it surmised, "EU 
law - which still binds Hungary - allows EU airlines the freedom to set airfares and pass on taxes to consumers 
without any interference from national governments."
It added: "The fact that this baseless fine was announced by the Hungarian Justice Minister on her Facebook page, 
even before Ryanair received any notification from the Hungarian CPA, shows this was a politically motivated fine 
from an agency which clearly lacks any independence or autonomy from the Hungarian Govt."
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary added in the statement: "Applying an 'excess profits' tax to the loss-making airline 
sector in Hungary is inexplicable, and only succeeds in making flying to/from Hungary more expensive and less 
competitive compared to other Central European airports who have lower costs."

Spanish strikes affect Iberia Express, easyJet , and Ryanair

 Air passengers in Spain are being tested as they have to accommodate strikes from easyJet and Iberia Express 
since this weekend, while Ryanair will be affected (again) next week. All strikes are organized by unions that call for 
higher salaries in the new collective agreements that are currently being negotiated. Spanish strikes affect Iberia 
Express, easyJet, and Ryanair. 
easyJet[1] has been affected by multiple strikes from pilot union Sepla, which has been demanding that the airline 
restores their working conditions and salaries to pre-pandemic levels, especially as the carrier benefits from a 
strong recovery. Talks have been ongoing for six months without success, resulting in the first strikes in July. From 
August 12-14, the pilot union also went on strike and again from August 27 until today, August 29. Affected are 
easyJet's bases in Barcelona, Malaga, and Palma de Mallorca. In July, the cabin crew also threatened to go on 
strike, but this was averted afterunion USO[2] reached an agreement. 
Iberia Express strike until September 6 
The same Union Sindical Obrera is now organizing a cabin crew strike at Iberia Express[3], which started on 
Sunday and will last until and including Tuesday, September 6. 'We demand decent wage conditions because we 
have frozen wages since 2015. We have parked the bulk of the demands for later and we have asked the company 
to update wages by 6.5 percent, in accordance with the CPI of 2021, to call off the strike. But Iberia Express does 
not agree and has asked us to call off in exchange for nothing', USO delegate Rubn Ramos said on Sunday in a 
media statement of the union. 
The strike led to the cancelation of eight flights on Sunday from Madrid to Gran Canaria, Palma de Mallorca, 
Sevilla, and Santiago. Iberia Express said that most passengers had been booked on other flights or given a 
voucher or a refund. Today, the strike affects ten flights, six on Tuesday, and eight each day from Wednesday until 
the final day on Tuesday next week. The airline said that it would be able to operate 94 flights or 90.4 percent of all 
flights today. 
The list of canceled flights includes only services that aren't protected by so-called Minimum Services by the 
Ministry of Transport. This sparked outrage in the union, with Ruben Ramos saying: 'The company is playing a dirty 
strategy, it is canceling all flights not protected by the minimum services, preventing crews from exercising their 
right to strike.'  
Spanish strikes affect Iberia Express, easyJet , and Ryanair
USO said it has filed a complaint against Iberia Express with the Spanish labor inspectorate for coercing cabin crew 
and asking them by email if they support the strike. The union also complains about the deprogramming of Express 
cabin crew on services out of London to European destinations, replacing Spanish crew with those of partner airline 
British Airways. 'This is yet another case of scabbing as striking workers are replaced for fear that they will decide 
to exercise their right and some of these flights will be canceled', USO says in its statement. 
In its own media statement, Iberia Express called on 'the responsibility of USO, the union that called for the strike, 
to call off the strikes and bet on dialogue and not on the social confrontation, which does so much damage to the 
workers of Iberia Express, its customers and the future of the company.'Parent airline Iberia[4] has scheduled 
negotiations on a new, multi-year collective agreement for September 15. The airline says that after two years of 
Covid crisis, it has incurred significant losses of €1.8 billion and has to repay €1.0 billion in debt. While 
acknowledging that all workers have also been hit hard by the effects of the pandemic and action must be taken, it 
calls on unions to take responsibility. 
Ryanair 
From September 5, USO has scheduled another four-day strike withRyanair[5] in Spain. This follows a strike in mid-
August. The union said in an August 19 media release that at the time eighteen workers had been dismissed by 
Ryanair, while disciplinary action had been taken against some 150 staff. USO has filed lawsuits against the Irish 
low-cost airline to fight the dismissal, which it says is against the constitutional right to strike.  
The airline also flew in crew from Ireland to take over from their Spanish colleagues, which are left on duty. 'Ryanair 
is using totally illegal techniques and weapons such as scabbing to make it seem that this strike is not supported by 
the workers, sanctioning and dismissing crew members for exercising this constitutional right,' USO delegate Lidia 
Arasanz is quoted. It has filed complaints over scabbing with the Spanish labor inspectorate.

Ryanair flight FR2872 from Milan Bergamo (BGY) to Vilnius (VNO) briefly entered Belarusian airspace on August 
25, 2022.
According to Flightradar24 data, the Boeing 737-800, owned by Ryanair's subsidiary Malta Air, proceeded through 
Italian, Austrian, Czech and Polish airspaces, and took a turn east shortly before entering Lithuanian airspace.
Around 8:14 pm GMT it entered Belarusian airspace near Lida and spent four minutes there, turning north and 
reentering Lithuanian airspace before landing at VNO.
According to Aerotelegraph, which reported the story first, the flightpath was changed to avoid severe 
thunderstorms.
The LightningMaps.org website indeed shows heavy storms in and around southern Lithuania on August 25, which 
likely prompted the pilots to briefly change their course.
This was the first time a Ryanair aircraft had entered Belarusian airspace since May 2021, when Belarusian 
authorities diverted the carrier's aircraft.
In that incident, FR4978 landed in Minsk (MSQ) after what was later found out to be a fake bomb threat, engineered 
by Belarusian authorities.
Belarusian oppositional activist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapiega were arrested immediately after 
the landing.
In July 2022, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) issued a report which condemned Belarus for 
endangering the safety of the flight with a deliberately false bomb threat.

Flights cancelled in Spain due to Iberia Express cabin crew strike

In Spain, 92 domestic flights are being cancelled, affecting some 17,000 passengers, due to a ten-day strike by 
cabin crew working for Iberia Express, the budget airline that is part of the Iberia group.
The flights that are being cancelled include connections from Madrid to Palma de Mallorca, Gran Canaria, Santiago 
de Compostela, Seville, Málaga and Tenerife, Spanish trade union USO said on Friday. They were due to depart 
between August 28 and September 6.
The cabin crew are holding the strike demanding the company start negotiating on a collective agreement and raise 
salaries, frozen since 2015, to the higher cost of living.
So far, only 24 flights between Sunday and Tuesday are definitely cancelled due to the industrial action, Iberia 
Express said, according to El País newspaper.
The Spain-based cabin crew of Irish low-cost airline Ryanair are also demanding better working conditions by 
striking from Monday to Thursday each week, which began on August 8 and is due to continue until January 7, 
2023. Ryanair is not complying with the law and is also refusing to negotiate, workers said.
British budget airline Easyjet cabin crew also went on strike for better working conditions in Spain this summer, but 
called an early end to the protest in July after reaching an agreement with management.
The wave of summer strikes has had little impact on passengers in Spain due to regulations maintaining minimum 
services. Even when staff walk out, often only a relatively small proportion of flights are cancelled.

easyJet PLC (LSE:EZJ) has cancelled more than 25 flights between the UK and Lisbon due to ground handler 
strikes at Portuguese airports over the bank holiday weekend.
Holiday traffic is expected to peak today with Belfast International, Birmingham and London Gatwick airports all 
expecting a huge throughput of travellers returning to the UK.
Four easyJet flights from London Gatwick were affected today, two on Saturday, and four on Sunday, with seven 
round-trips to the Portuguese capital cancelled at Luton airport over the weekend, representing 14 flights.
One round trip from Manchester has also been cancelled by the airline, but reports indicate there appears to be little 
effect on the main holiday airport of Faro, serving the Algarve.
Currently, British Airways, the carrier owned by London-listed International Consolidated Airlines Group SA 
(LSE:IAG), Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA), TAP Portugal, and Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) do not appear 
to be affected by the disruption.
Luton and Stansted airports meanwhile are tipped to be the busiest airports on Monday's bank holiday - August 29.

Aug 26, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] was the chief newsmaker following its decision to increase the 
projection for the number of passengers to be transported in fiscal 2023 (ending Mar 31, 2023). American Airlines 
AAL[2] was also in the news, courtesy of its management's decision to expand its regional operations. To this end, 
AAL inked a five-year deal with Air Wisconsin. Meanwhile, JetBlue Airways JBLU[3] reportedly[4] announced some 
route cuts to ensure operational efficiency. 
AAL also grabbed the headlines recently when it inked a deal with Boom Supersonic to purchase up to 20 Overture 
planes from the latter. The story was reported in detail in the previous week's write-up[5]. Recap of the Latest Top 
Stories 1. Ryanair now expects passenger volumes for fiscal 2023 to be 166.5 million. The previous expectation 
was 165 million. Ryanair augmented its UK capacity by adding one million plus seats to/from 20 airports in the UK. 
The raised forecast is owing to management's decision to boost the airline's UK winter schedule following a 
reduction in the winter schedule capacity of its rival British Airways[6]. RYAAY currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 
(Hold). 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7]. 
2. With an eye on maintaining its operations to small markets, American Airlines announced that Air Wisconsin will 
be part of the American Eagle family by March 2023 in the face of acute pilot crisis. Air Wisconsin's fleet will start 
operating for American Eagle within next March. American Eagle is a network of multiple regional carriers that 
operate under a codeshare and service pact with AAL. 
Per the terms of the deal, Air Wisconsin will be responsible for operating up to 60 aircraft of its fleet of 50-seat CRJ-
200s, primarily from AAL's hub at the Chicago - O'Hare International. Currently, Air Wisconsin operates flights for 
United Airlines UAL[8] from the latter's (Chicago-based carrier) hubs at O'Hare and Dulles International Airports. Air 
Wisconsin's partnership with UAL is likely to come to an end, in accordance with its terms.[9] 
3. Management at JetBlue decided to trim its network by terminating services to some destinations. To this end, 
JBLU decided to stop its nonstop flights from San Francisco International Airport to Newark after Sep 6, 2022. Per a 
statement issued by the management, 'To ensure continued operational reliability, we're planning a schedule 
change for this fall and into 2023 that will extend some of the market suspensions we put in place earlier this year,' 
4. Per a CNBC report[10], the U.S. administration decided to suspend 26 flights to China from the United States by 
four Chinese carriers, namely Xiamen, Air China, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines. The decision, 
Airline Stock Roundup: RYAAY 's Solid FY23 Traffic View, AAL 's Deal & More
which will impact flights from Sep 5 to Sep 28, follows a similar ruling from the Chinese government, whereby 26 
U.S.-bound flights by Delta, American Airlines and United Airlines were suspended due to COVID-19 cases.

The recently constructed North Runway at Dublin Airport commenced operations today with the 12.00 departure of 
Ryanair flight FR1964 to Eindhoven.
The (EURO)320m North Runway (designated 10L/28R), located on daa lands some 1.69 kilometres north of Dublin 
Airport's existing South Runway, will support the creation of 31,200 new jobs and (EURO)2.2 billion in additional 
economic activity. The development of North Runway has been part of Dublin Airport's long-term strategic planning 
and land use prioritisation since the 1960s, which has enabled delivery within Dublin Airport's existing campus, 
substantially mitigating cost, disruption and limiting construction time.
North Runway fulfils a key mandate set by the Government's National Aviation Policy, by enabling Dublin Airport to 
develop as an international hub for leading airlines and enhancing connectivity of Ireland's island economy for the 
benefit of consumers, tourism and Foreign Direct Investment. North Runway will facilitate larger aircraft and 
connectivity with long-haul destinations as well as much needed extra runway slot capacity for short-haul flights 
during early morning and late evening peak departure and arrival periods.
North Runway is critical to Dublin's growing position as a hub for travel between Europe and North America, in 
particular. Enhanced connectivity will mean a greater choice of destinations and airlines for business and leisure 
customers, as well competitive fares. Ensuring Dublin Airport is attractive to airlines is vital to ensure aviation 
business is not lost to Ireland, with no other airport on the island having the route network necessary to support 
acting as a gateway between Europe and North America.
North Runway was designed to be fully compliant with European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) standards to 
ensure Dublin Airport can operate as a Category IIIB runway, capable of servicing larger, typically long-haul aircraft, 
up to and including Code F types (wingspans 65m to 80m) including Boeing 747-8 and Airbus A 380-800 aircraft.
The Boeing 737-8-200 aircraft used today for the inaugural flight on North Runway is one of a growing number of 
next generation aircraft operating at Dublin Airport that is up to 40% quieter than previous models whilst also 
burning less fuel.
The opening of North Runway further strengthens international connectivity for Ireland and underpins Dublin 
Airports position as a leading European airport and a key gateway to North America.

Board revamp announced at EASYJET after disruption in May and June Airlines

EasyJet has announced a shake-up of its board, with three directors leaving as management aims to move on from 
this summer's disruption.
Former Google executive Nick Leeder, who joined the board in 2019, steps down at the end of September, while 
Julie Southern and Andreas Bierwirth will not seek re-election at the company's annual meeting in 2023.
The departing trio will be replaced by Harald Eisenächer, Detlef Trefzger and Ryanne Van der Eijk.
EasyJet chair Stephen Hester said the appointees would bring "extensive airline and travel industry experience, 
with extra focus on operations and logistics, customer experience, digital and data.
This, combined with their European outlook, will further strengthen the board".
Eisenächer is a former Lufthansa and Deutsche Telekom executive who recently worked for a Danish airfare 
technology company, while Trefzger has just stepped down as chief executive of Swiss logistics business Kuehne + 
Nagel. Van der Eijk has served 20 years at KLM.
Hester is a veteran of the City with a reputation as a turnround specialist, who was appointed EASYJET chair 12 
months ago.
Board revamp announced at EASYJET after disruption in May and June Airlines
The board changes follow a difficult summer for EASYJET, which was caught up in the barrage of flight 
cancellations, delays and disruption in May and June that marred the return of mass travel.
The airline, which pinned much of the blame on staff sickness and issues across the supply chain such as air traffic 
control delays, was forced to pare back its summer schedule slightly in early July to inject greater resilience into its 
operations.
Its activities have since stabilised, and cancellations have fallen back to normal levels in recent weeks.
Hester and Lundgren were boosted last month when Sir Stelios Haji- Ioannou, founder and largest shareholder of 
EASYJET, called a truce in a longrunning and bitter battle with the airline's management over the size of its fleet, 
and backed a multibillion-dollar order from passenger jet manufacturer Airbus.
However, the outlook for EASYJET and the rest of the industry remains challenging.
Carriers are exposed to the rising cost of jet fuel following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while the darkening 
economic outlook across Europe has raised questions over whether the high demand for travel this summer is 
sustainable.
EasyJet's shares, which were flat in London yesterday, have declined 40 per cent this year, more than British 
Airways owner IAG and Ryanair, which have each lost about 30 per cent.
Stock of Hungarian low-cost airline Wizz Air has fallen more than 50 per cent.

What is the current state of Ukrainian civil aviation after six months of war?

Two important events occur on August 24, 2022: the Ukrainian Independence Day and the six-month anniversary of 
the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
One of the major impacts of this invasion, the largest European conflict since the Second World War, was felt by 
civil aviation across Central and Eastern Europe.
Ukrainian aviation bore the lion's share of that devastation. As missiles began to fall on the country's airports during 
the early hours of February 24, 2022, and the first airspace closures were announced, it soon became clear that the 
skies above the country were going to change.
But how have they changed during the past six months? Let's take a look.
Empty skies
It is important to remember that the war was not unexpected. Warnings of an impending invasion prompted many 
airlines to reduce or stop their flights to Ukraine as early as mid-February.
Ukrainian airlines were among the few to continue operations, in addition to low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and 
Wizz Air, as well as Turkish Airlines, Qatar Airways and Air Baltic.
So, the skies above Ukraine were already half-empty, even before February 24.
But on February 24 all flights ceased as early that morning Ukraine issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) 
prohibiting the entry of its space across all the country's air identification zones.
Moldova also closed its airspace because the entire country is situated in close proximity to Ukraine. Russia 
prohibited entry to parts of its airspace close to the border with Ukraine, as did Belarus.
Little has changed since then, save for Moldova opening a part of its airspace to allow for flights to Chisinau 
International Airport (KIV) in August 2022.
So, for half-a-year now, only military aircraft belonging to Russian and Ukrainian air forces have been seen in 
Ukrainian airspace, conducting transport flights, attacks and sometimes even engaging in dogfights.
What is the current state of Ukrainian civil aviation after six months of war?
Airlines without a home
The gradual rise in tensions was, in its own way, beneficial to Ukrainian airlines. Some of the aircraft were stationed 
abroad before the beginning of the invasion and were spared from the attacks and airspace closures.
For example, Antonov Airlines, Ukraine's iconic freight carrier, evacuated some of its aircraft and continues to fly 
them, conducting charter flights and supporting Ukraine's war effort. Leipzig (LEJ), where the airline already had an 
established base, became the main hub for surviving Antonov An-124s.

Ryanair lifts annual traffic outlook on UK winter capacity growth

Highlight: Irish ultra-low-cost carrier Ryanair has announced the addition of more than one million low-fare seats to 
its UK winter schedule.
Body
The seats have been increased for its flights operating across 20 airports in the UK. This move comes after 
workforce shortfall and capacity reduction at Heathrow Airport (LHR) led British Airways (BA) to cancel more than 
10,000 flights (8%) of its winter schedule. 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said: "While BA is cancelling 8% of their winter schedule due to staff shortages and 
'Hopeless Heathrow's' capacity restrictions, Ryanair is now adding more capacity (over one million low-fare seats) 
to our largest ever UK winter schedule so that UK families can book with confidence that they will get to their low-
fare city break and winter sun getaways without the risk of flight cancellations and avoiding 'Hopeless Heathrow' as 
well." With this decision, Ryanair anticipates that its 2022 annual passenger volume could increase from the original 
target of 165 million to more than 166.5 million. It added that the move would give its UK customers more low-fare 
seats to destinations such as Spain, Italy, Portugal, Morocco, Greece and France. O'Leary added: "Ryanair is the 
UK's most reliable airline, offering the lowest fares from just £29.99 and the widest choice of destinations to/from its 
20 UK airports this winter, including Stansted, Gatwick, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Edinburgh and 
many more." In March, Ryanair unveiled its ambition to become carbon neutral by 2050. The budget airline aims to 
reach 34% of decarbonisation with the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) usage and 32% through 
technological and operational upgrades.

RYANAIR announced yesterday it was adding one million additional seats to its winter schedule while the likes of 
British Airways (BA) continued to axe flights.
The airline now expects to carry 166.5m passengers by the end of the year - 1.5m more than initially predicted.
The low-cost carrier said it was increasing its capacity to and from 20 UK airports in response to BA's decision to 
cancel 10,000 flights due to staff shortages and Heathrow's extension of the passenger cap until the end of 
October.
Initially introduced in early July, Heathrow's 100,000 daily passengers' cap was supposed to stay in place until 11 
September.
"While BA are cancelling eight per cent of their winter schedule due to staff shortages and 'Hopeless Heathrow's' 
capacity restrictions, Ryanair is now adding more capacity to our largest ever UK winter schedule, so that UK 
families can book with confidence that they will get to their low-fare city break and winter sun getaways without the 
risk of flight cancellations and avoiding 'Hopeless Heathrow' as well," said chief executive Michael O'Leary.
BA said on Monday that it would "protect key holiday destinations over half term," giving affected customers the 
option to get a refund or book another flight.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) appealed against a fine it received in Hungary for passing the cost of a new business tax to 
passengers, Reuters reported Wednesday.
The low-cost carrier received a fine of 300 million Hungarian forints ($726,000) after a consumer protection 
investigation. The Hungarian government in May passed a new law to tax extra profits earned by companies in 
several sectors.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary claimed that the European Union regulations allow airlines to set prices 
and pass taxes to customers.

Hungary launches investigation against Wizz Air

The government of Hungary has ordered an investigation into a second low-cost carrier, Wizz Air (W6, Budapest), 
over possible breaches of consumer protection laws, having already sparked a probe against Ryanair (FR, Dublin 
Int'l) this summer, Associated Press reported on August 22 citing the Magyar Távirati Iroda (MTI) news agency.
An apparent rise in complaints against the Budapest-based airline prompted the Ministry of Justice to begin the 
investigation, which the ministry claimed was over its failure to provide information and assistance to customers 
whose flights have been delayed or cancelled.
Other complaints, it said, relate to the carrier's alleged failure to provide accommodation and rebookings for 
affected passengers, not responding to consumer complaints within 30 days, and operating a customer service line 
that is paid, which violates Hungarian law, the ministry said in a statement issued to the news agency.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban's nationalist government launched its investigation against Ryanair after imposing a 
windfall tax on industries ranging from banking to aviation that it claims have enjoyed "extra profits" from surging 
demand after the pandemic, a claim the Irish carrier has ridiculed. Earlier this month, Budapest fined it HUF300 
million forints (USD731,000) for passing the cost onto consumers, and the carrier then axed a number of routes 
from the country.
Wizz Air had been less vocal than Ryanair in its opposition to the tax. It did not immediately respond to ch-aviation's 
request for comment.
In related news, Jourik Hooghe will step down from his post as Wizz Air Holdings' executive vice president and 
group chief financial officer to pursue opportunities outside the company. A replacement, Ian Malin, who is currently 
chief strategy and commercial officer at US-based parts supplier Unical Aviation, will take up the position on 
October 1. Hooghe joined the airline in February 2020 and will be available during a transition period until 
December 31.

British Airways (BA) has announced plans to adjust its end-of-summer and winter schedule after London Heathrow 
Airport extended the daily cap on passenger numbers until October 29, 2022, and asked airlines to sell fewer 
flights.
"Following Heathrow's decision to extend its passenger cap we're making adjustments to our short-haul schedule 
for the next two months," the airline said in a statement provided to AeroTime.
Under Heathrow's extended restrictions the airline will have to cancel on average a further 12 short-haul roundtrips 
from London Heathrow each day until October 29, 2022, BA told AeroTime. In total, the airline is taking out 629 
round trips for this period.
"While the vast majority of our customers will travel as planned and we're protecting key holiday destinations over 
half-term, we will need to make some further cancellations up to the end of October," BA said in the statement.
The airline also expects to cut up to 5,000 roundtrips from its winter short-haul schedule until the end of March next 
year.

previously expected target of 165 million passengers.
Reuters said the company added more than 1 million seats to and from 20 UK airports after rival British Airways, 
owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group, an Anglo-Spanish company known as IAG, cut its winter 
schedule.
Ryanair reported 97 million passengers in its last financial year, Reuters said.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) expects its Spanish cabin crew's planned third wave of strikes to have zero impact on its flight 
operations since they only involve a "handful" of the members, Alliance News reported Monday, citing a company 
spokesperson.
The Irish air carrier claimed that flight cancelations in July were attributable to delays and air traffic control strikes, 
not the labor action of its cabin crew in Spain. Ryanair added that cabin crew members represented by the CCOO 
union already reached a labor deal with the company.
Labor unions USO and SITCPLA said their members intend to strike from Aug. 8, 2022, to Jan. 7, 2023, due to the 
budget airline's refusal to participate in "any dialogue."
Ryanair marginally declined on Monday's close.

‘extreme caution’ as the global economy continues to behave erratically.
Body
Rathbones’ head of multi-asset investments, David Coombs, is approaching the second half of the year with 
‘extreme caution’ as the global economy continues to behave erratically following the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Managing several global portfolios, including the medium-risk £1.6bn (€1.9bn) Strategic Growth  fund, which he 
runs with Will McIntosh-Whyte, Coombs (pictured below) said he had anticipated a US recession over a year ago 
but is more concerned about pandemic effects. 
‘Covid reopening is a volatility factor that is impossible to pin down,’ he said. 
He warned the last glimmers of ‘Covid euphoria’ – or UK consumers’ insensitivity to high prices – will peter out 
‘pretty damn quick’ in October as rocketing energy prices hit home and companies start to let staff go at the start of 
a recession. 
UK consumer confidence has already hit its lowest level on record, market researcher GfK announced today, after 
annual inflation passed 10% and real wages registered their biggest ever decline last quarter. 
The recent rebound in growth stocks lifted his fund’s performance in 2022, but Coombs remains cautious about the 
outlook. He pointed to Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary’s recent declaration that the era of cheap flights is over as an 
example of the repercussions of the pandemic. 
‘People who expected the global economy to readjust a couple of months after the pandemic was coming to a 
close, assuming it is, were hugely naive,’ said Coombs. 
‘Something as complex as the global economy will take two to three years to totally rebalance to some kind of 
equilibrium.’ 
One measure Coombs is taking is increasing the Strategic Growth portfolio’s exposure to gold, which he said is a 
safe haven during periods of geopolitical risk. He has raised the position to 2.1% over recent months, selling 
holdings in industrial metals, oil and energy to free up cash. 
Proceed with ‘extreme caution’ this year, warns outperforming multi-asset PM
Coombs declared his surprise soon after the war in Ukraine broke out that gold was not trading higher, saying it 
‘should be closer to $3,000’. 
With bullion drifting back below $1,800 an ounce, that hunch has not played out. But Coombs said gold is not an 
inflation hedge as many believe and ‘typically tends to be inversely correlated to US interest rates’. 
His core assumption has been that US interest rates would peak at about 3.5%. Now they are about 1% below that 
and, with the pace of rate rises potentially tailing off, that ‘should provide a better backdrop for the gold price amid 
continued geopolitical risk’. 
One hedge Coombs has put some money into is shorter-dated conventional government bonds, where prices rose 
and yields compressed as ‘recession talks picked up’. Government bonds, particularly in the US, Australia and 
Canada, account for 11.2% of the fund, according to its July factsheet. 
Gilts, or UK government bonds, are unattractive because the UK’s economic strategy ‘lacks cohesion’, Coombs 
said, and with an ongoing campaign for a new prime minister, it is unclear what the government’s strategy will be. 
On the other hand, the US Federal Reserve is clearer on its strategy for tightening monetary policy. 
‘The US is attractive compared with the UK and Europe. US 10-year bonds are attractive and a safe-haven asset,’ 
Coombs said. 
‘It’s hard to invest in UK gilts because you have no idea what’s going to happen with the ongoing battle for prime 
minister and the Bank of England interest rate hikes.’ 
US equities are also a better fit for his growth-biased portfolio, making up 40% compared with the UK’s 11%. Top 
positions include Amazon, tech supplier Aptiv and Google parent Alphabet. 
The portfolio has fallen 7.7% in 2022 compared with its UK Consumer Price index plus 3% benchmark’s rise of 
8.2%, according to the July factsheet, but performance has been stronger since mid-June. 
Over the longer term, the fund has a solid record, returning 151% since launch in 2009 compared with 109% for its 
benchmark. 
Multi-asset portfolios have remained popular with investors as oscillating markets this year have made it difficult to 
choose value or growth. 
The fund has recorded net inflows of £200m in 2022, according to Morningstar data, with cash currently standing at 
6.5%.

 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] expects to fly more passengers than previously estimated in fiscal 2023 (endingMar 
31, 2023). The raised forecast is owing to the management's decision to boost the airline's UK winter schedule 
following a reduction in the winter schedule capacity of its rival British Airways. 
Per a Reuters report[2], Ryanair now expects passenger volumes for fiscal 2023 to be 166.5 million. The previous 
expectation was 165 million. Ryanair augmented its UK capacity by adding above one million seats to/from 20 
airports in the UK. 
Management of British Airways decided to cancel some flights until Oct 31, 2022. This came after the 
announcement that Heathrow airport will slash capacity to combat widespread operational disruption. Ryanair, 
however, does not fly from Heathrow. 
Many European carriers, like their U.S. counterparts, have been struggling for a while to tackle the buoyant air-
travel demand scenario in the post-lockdown era due to staff shortage. 
Ryanair, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has been aided by upbeat air traffic. In July, RYAAY flew 16.8 
million passengers, the highest ever traffic volume at the carrier in the said month. Last July, only 9.3 million 
passengers were transported by RYAAY. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) increased to 96% from 80% 
in July 2021. The number of passengers ferried by RYAAY in July 2022 was 14.2% higher than the 14.8 million 
passengers flown in July 2019 (pre-coronavirus era).

BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary's government has ordered an investigation of domestic low-cost carrier 
Wizz Air over what it calls possible breaches of consumer protection laws, the second such investigation it has 
launched against an airline since June.
The probe, ordered by Hungary's Ministry of Justice comes after the ministry said it received an increase in 
complaints against the Budapest-based airline over its failure to provide information and assistance to customers 
whose flights are delayed or cancelled, according to Hungary's state news agency MTI.
Other complaints included Wizz Air failing to provide accommodation and rebooking for affected passengers, failure 
to respond to consumer complaints within 30 days and operating a paid customer service line, which violates 
Hungarian law and consumer rights, the ministry said in a statement.
It is the second investigation against an airline launched by Prime Minister Viktor Orban's nationalist government 
since June, when it announced it would impose windfall taxes on industries from banking to insurance to airlines 
that have enjoyed “extra profits” arising from soaring demand after the pandemic — a claim some companies have 
contested.
Earlier this month, Hungary accused budget carrier Ryanair of consumer protection violations and fined it more than 
three-quarters of a million euros after the company raised ticket prices to cope with the new tax, which Ryanair 
CEO Michael O’Leary has called “highway robbery” and “idiotic.”
The government hopes to raise 815 billion forints ($2.1 billion) from the tax policy to see the country through a 
period of soaring inflation and energy prices, and budget shortfalls from pre-election handouts earlier this year in 
which Orban won a fourth consecutive term.
Wizz Air didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
In a statement, the Ministry of Justice said the aim of the procedure is to “detect, stop and sanction any possible 
illegal behavior, since all businesses must comply with the law.”

 An aircraft of the low-cost of Wizz Air airlines painted in the colours of the logo of host city candidate Budapest for 
the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games is displayed in Liszt Ferenc International Airport in Budapest, Hungary, 
Nov. 24, 2016. Hungary's government has ordered an investigation of domestic low-cost carrier Wizz Air over what 
it calls possible breaches of consumer protection laws, the second such investigation it has launched against an 
airline since June 2022. (Szilard Koszticsak/MTI via AP, File ) 
BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary's government has ordered an investigation of domestic low-cost carrier 
Wizz Air over what it calls possible breaches of consumer protection laws, the second such investigation it has 
launched against an airline since June.  
The probe, ordered by Hungary's Ministry of Justice comes after the ministry said it received an increase in 
complaints against the Budapest-based airline over its failure to provide information and assistance to customers 
whose flights are delayed or cancelled, according to Hungary's state news agency MTI.  
Other complaints included Wizz Air failing to provide accommodation and rebooking for affected passengers, failure 
to respond to consumer complaints within 30 days and operating a paid customer service line, which violates 
Hungarian law and consumer rights, the ministry said in a statement.  
It is the second investigation against an airline launched by Prime Minister Viktor Orban's nationalist government 
since June, when it announced it would impose windfall taxes on industries from banking to insurance to airlines 
that have enjoyed 'extra profits' arising from soaring demand after the pandemic — a claim some companies have 
contested. 
Earlier this month, Hungary accused budget carrier Ryanair of consumer protection violations and fined it more than 
three-quarters of a million euros after the company raised ticket prices to cope with the new tax, which Ryanair 
CEO Michael O'Leary has called 'highway robbery' and 'idiotic.' 
The government hopes to raise 815 billion forints ($2.1 billion) from the tax policy to see the country through a 
period of soaring inflation and energy prices, and budget shortfalls from pre-election handouts earlier this year in 
which Orban won a fourth consecutive term. 
Wizz Air didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.  
In a statement, the Ministry of Justice said the aim of the procedure is to 'detect, stop and sanction any possible 
illegal behavior, since all businesses must comply with the law.'

The Safest Option in Trades! 
Hungary 's govt launches investigation against second airline
If you're new to trading, then you've probably heard the wrong thing about options—that they're risky, unpredictable, 
or difficult. And it couldn't be more wrong! With the Hughes Optioneering Strategy, you'll soon learn that the safest 
option for new accounts is options themselves! 
When inflation rises, it's not difficult to notice higher prices. But you don't have to be very old to understand the 
expression that a dollar doesn't buy as much as it used to. The Happy Meal was introduced in 1979 for a price of 
$1.10[1]. Today, that same meal costs $2.99. Yet, it remains one of the restaurant chain's most popular items. It's 
also a barometer for the economy because of its convenience for parents. 
And consider the iPhone which costs 81% more in 2022[2] than the initial model that launched in 2007. Yet despite 
the increase in price, consumers are willing to pay whatever is required. 
The key to both of these examples, and others like them, is pricing power. A company that has the ability to raise its 
prices can maintain its profit margins. That means it delivers consistent results regardless of what's happening in 
the broader economy. In good times, this may be taken for granted. But when the economy slows down, that 
consistency stands out. 
In this special presentation, we're looking at seven companies with significant pricing power at all times, particularly 
with inflation currently running at 40-year highs.

Ryanair axes eight Hungary routes over "stupid" tax

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has dropped eight of its routes from its Budapest roster over the imposition of what its 
chief executive Michael O'Leary called the "stupid and illogical" decision of the Hungarian government to impose a 
new departure tax.
Ryanair has been vocal since the tax was announced in late May, demanding that it be scrapped, but Viktor 
Orbán's government insists it is part of efforts to fight inflation. Earlier this month, the budget carrier said it would 
appeal to the courts of the European Union after Hungary fined it HUF300 million forints (USD750,000) for passing 
the costs on to passengers.
The new levy involves a tax of EUR10 to EUR25 euros (USD10.50-26.50) per passenger departing Hungary and 
came into effect on July 1. For bookings made after June 30, Ryanair has included HUF3,900 (USD9.75) in the 
price.
The eight route casualties - to be imposed at the start of the coming Winter 22/23 season - are to Bordeaux, 
Bournemouth, Cologne/Bonn, Kaunas, Kraków, Lappeenranta, Riga, and Turin, Ryanair said in a statement on its 
website. A further seven routes will have their frequencies cut, to Amman Queen Alia, Bristol Int'l, Pisa, Prague 
Václav Havel, Sofia, Tel Aviv Ben Gurion, and Warsaw Chopin.
It branded as "bizarre" and "idiotic" this excess profits tax on airlines - companies that have been "reporting record 
losses due to Covid." The tax "is already damaging Hungarian tourism, connectivity, traffic, and jobs - as evidenced 
by these latest winter cuts," it said.
"We regret these route and flight cuts which are caused solely by the stupid and illogical decision of the Hungarian 
govt to impose an 'excess profits' on the loss-making airline industry, which now makes flying to/from Hungary more 
expensive and less competitive," O'Leary commented in the statement. "These routes and flights will be switched to 
other lower-cost neighbouring countries like Slovakia, Austria, Croatia, and Romania."
He added that all Hungarian passengers affected by the route closures and frequency cuts will receive email 
notifications in the coming days offering refunds or alternative flights.
Ryanair axes eight Hungary routes over "stupid" tax
According to the ch-aviation capacities module, Ryanair currently operates 61 routes from Hungary, all of them from 
Budapest. By the week starting October 31, this reduces to 53. Its subsidiary Buzz (Poland) is one of three 
passenger carriers operating a crew base there, the others being Smartwings (Hungary) and Wizz Air.

Wizz Air (W6, Budapest) has announced the opening of a base in Suceava with the stationing of two A321-200NXs 
to open five new routes from the north-eastern Romanian city.
This means the Hungarian budget carrier now operates 11 routes to seven countries from Suceava's Stefan cel 
Mare International Airport, the airline said in a statement.
The five new routes, frequencies, and launch dates are:
December 15: 2x weekly to Paris Beauvais (France);
December 16: 3x weekly to Brussels Charleroi (Belgium); and 2x weekly to Venice Treviso (Italy)
December 17: 2x weekly to Larnaca (Cyprus); and 2x weekly to Eindhoven (Netherlands).
Wizz Air will also increase frequencies to the following Italian destinations from Suceava: 3x weekly to Bologna; 
daily to Milan Bergamo; and 5x weekly to Rome Fiumicino.
Speaking at a press conference in Suceava, Wizz Air Acting Network Officer Evelin Jeckel said the base's opening 
marks an important milestone for the carrier's Romanian network, which will continue to expand.
Wizz Air competes with Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) at Suceava where the Irish budget carrier has about 35% market 
share at the airport (in terms of weekly seat capacity), while Wizz Air trails at around 28%, with Tarom (RO, 
Bucharest Otopeni) holding a minor market share of about 8%, the ch-aviation capacities module shows.

Flights cancelled as Easyjet 's Spain pilots strike
Flights cancelled as Easyjet's Spain pilots strike

(Alliance News) - Fourteen international flights were cancelled Friday as Easyjet PLC's Spanish pilots began a new 
three-day work stoppage calling for the reinstatement of conditions they enjoyed before the pandemic, union 
officials said. 
Coming at the height of the summer tourist season, the new Easyjet stoppages only add problems to a sector 
struggling with rolling strikes by cabin crew at budget rival Ryanair that began in June and will continue until 
January. 
Easyjet shares were down 3.6% to 393.96 pence each in London on Friday afternoon. 
Six of the Easyjet cancellations affected flights flying into or out of Barcelona, while the other eight involved arrivals 
and departures from Palma de Mallorca in the Balearic Isles, the SEPLA union said in an update at 1130 GMT. 
"These are international flights to or from Geneva, Milan, Paris, London or Basel," the union said. 
Easyjet pilots began their first three-day strike on August 12, prompting the cancellation of 36 flights in and out of 
Barcelona, Malaga and the Balearic Islands. 
A third strike is scheduled to take place from August 27-29. 
The strike began just two weeks after the airline's cabin crew went on strike, resulting in a deal.
The pilots are demanding the restoration of conditions they enjoyed before the pandemic and the resumption of 
talks for a new collective agreement.
During the pandemic they had agreed to a pay cut to ensure "not only our jobs but the survival of the company itself 
in Spain," the union explained on August 12, saying Easyjet had refused to restore their pre-Covid working 
conditions. 
Flights cancelled as Easyjet 's Spain pilots strike
The rolling strike by Ryanair staff has so far had a limited impact, involving more delays than flight cancellations. 
Cabin crew at Iberia Express, the low-cost arm of Spain's Iberia national carrier, are also expected to stage a 10-
day strike from August 28 to September 6, the USO union has said.

Body
Rathbones’ head of multi-asset investments David Coombs is approaching the second half of the year with 
‘extreme caution’ as the global economy continues to behave erratically following the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Managing several global portfolios, including the medium-risk £1.6bn Strategic Growth  fund, which he runs with 
Will McIntosh-Whyte, Coombs (pictured below) said he had anticipated a US recession over a year ago but is more 
concerned about pandemic effects. 
‘Covid reopening is a volatility factor that is impossible to pin down,’ he said. 
He warned the last glimmers of ‘Covid euphoria’ – or UK consumers’ insensitivity to high prices – will peter out 
‘pretty damn quick’ in October as rocketing energy prices hit home and companies start to let staff go at the start of 
a recession. 
UK consumer confidence has already hit its lowest level on record, market researcher GfK announced today, after 
annual inflation passed 10% and real wages registered their biggest ever decline last quarter. 
Despite the recent ‘growth’ stock rebound lifting his fund’s performance in 2022, Coombs remains cautious about 
the outlook. He pointed to Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary’s recent declaration that the era of cheap flights is over as 
an example of the repercussions of the pandemic. 
‘People who expected the global economy to readjust a couple of months after the pandemic was coming to a 
close, assuming it is, were hugely naive,’ said Coombs. 
‘Something as complex as the global economy will take two to three years to totally rebalance some kind of 
equilibrium.’ 
One measure being taken is increasing the Strategic Growth portfolio’s exposure to gold, which he said is a safe 
haven during periods of geopolitical risk. He has increased the position to 2.1% over recent months, selling holdings 
in industrial metals, oil and energy to free up cash. 
Rathbones’ Coombs: Proceed with ‘extreme caution’ this year
The manager declared his surprise soon after the war in Ukraine broke out that gold was not trading higher, saying 
it ‘should be closer to $3,000’. 
With bullion drifting back below $1,800 (£1,526) an ounce, that hunch has not played out. But Coombs said gold is 
not an inflation hedge as many believe and ‘typically tends to be inversely correlated to US interest rates’. 
His core assumption has been that US interest rates would peak at around 3.5%. Now they are about 1% below 
that and, with the pace of rate rises potentially tailing off, that ‘should provide a better backdrop for the gold price 
amid continued geopolitical risk’. 
One hedge Coombs has piled some money into is shorter-dated conventional government bonds, where prices 
rose and yields compressed as ‘recession talks picked up’. Government bonds, particularly in the US, Australia and 
Canada, hold an 11.2% weighting, according to the July factsheet. 
Gilts, or UK government bonds, are unattractive because the UK’s economic strategy ‘lacks cohesion’, Coombs 
said, and with an ongoing campaign for a new prime minister, it is unclear what the government’s strategy will be. 
On the other hand, the US Federal Reserve is clearer on its strategy for tightening monetary policy. 
‘The US is attractive compared with the UK and Europe. US 10-year bonds are attractive and a safe-haven asset,’ 
Coombs said.

Ryanair boosts Stansted flights as cap extended

RYANAIR said it will add more than 500 flights serving London Stansted during the October half-term school 
holiday after Heathrow extended its cap on passenger numbers.
The Dublin-based airline said the extra flights at the Essex airport will have capacity for 100,000 passengers.
Heathrow announced on Monday that the limit of 100,000 daily departing passengers it introduced in July due to 
staff shortages will continue until 29 October.
Aviation data company Cirium said the extension will lead to a reduction in capacity of more than one million seats, 
from 5.9m to 4.8m.
Many families hoping to get away during half-term will have their plans disrupted.
The cap was initially due to run until 11 September.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said: "While hopeless Heathrow continues to cut flights and raise fares for 
families, Ryanair and London Stansted continue to add flights, and offer thousands of low-fare seats for the autumn 
mid-term break.
"With over 500 additional flights, more than 100,000 additional seats and prices starting from just (EURO)29.99 
(£25.29), Ryanair looks forward to welcoming thousands of additional families during the autumn mid-term break on 
its low-fare flights to/from London Stansted Airport.
Heathrow has repeatedly criticised airlines for a shortage of ground handlers at the airport, which has resulted in 
thousands of items of baggage not being put on to their owners' flights this summer.
Ryanair boosts Stansted flights as cap extended
Ryanair insisted that it and Stansted have "more than sufficient staff to handle these additional flights".

Heathrow's hopelessness is its faux helplessness
Heathrow's hopelessness is its faux helplessness

When Heathrow extended a summer cap on passenger numbers to the October halfterm, Ryanair boss Michael 
O'Leary dubbed the airport "hopeless Heathrow".
O'Leary rarely misses a chance to have a dig at rivals, often rightly. But the passenger cap, introduced in July and 
lengthened on Monday, is not what makes Heathrow hopeless.
Flight cancellations are down markedly, according to industry data. Punctuality has improved. Baggage delays 
appear to be easing.
There will be some hit from the 100,000-a-day departing traveller limit, although few hard financial details are 
available. Heathrow only earns revenue from passengers when they pass through the airport. However, Emirates' 
projection of "airmageddon" when the caps were announced in July looks wide of the mark.
Most of the industry's hurt will come not from Heathrow's cap but the airlines' self-inflicted capacity cuts. British 
Airways, Heathrow's biggest user, trimmed its forecasts for the year from 80 per cent of 2019 capacity levels to 78 
per cent when it reported earnings a fortnight ago. Break that down, and of the 18 per cent cut to May-October flight 
numbers, only 0.5 percentage points were because of the cap.
The financial impact is not clear-cut either. Analysts argue that a more limited supply of flights for last-minute 
travellers will, in general, mean higher fares per passenger. Pricing trends for air fares have been firm. A day after 
the "airmageddon" announcement, Emirates agreed to play nice.
Heathrow's hopelessness is its faux helplessness
That said, service has fallen short. If it had not, there would not be a cap in the first place.
Sure, other airports have instituted curbs: Amsterdam Schiphol, Frankfurt and Gatwick have similar schemes. But 
with Heathrow, there is the sense that nothing is ever the airport's fault.
Resourcing? Security staffing was due to be back to pre-pandemic levels by the end of last month. The shortfall 
was because of ground handlers "who are contracted by airlines". Poor punctuality? "Delays at other airports and 
airspace congestion across Europe." Security queues? More leisure travellers who take more luggage and are less 
aware of travel rules, like what to do with liquids in carry-on.
The passenger limits announced on Monday were made "after consultation with airlines", a response, perhaps, to a 
sense that the previous round was imposed on the rest of the industry.
But the fact is that airlines adjusted their schedules to what they thought they could cope with before Heathrow 
introduced its cap because of a government amnesty scheme that allowed them to hand back slots temporarily. 
Since the airlines are the ones that hire the ground-handling companies - or in BA's case, do the ground-handling - 
you would think they could judge their own flight capacity (although, admittedly, there will be incentives to 
overbook). It was only after that exercise that Heathrow instituted its cap, in effect saying it knew better. It seems 
more likely that Heathrow knows the limits of its own operations rather than airlines', which did not buy the excuse 
in any case. BA's owner International Airlines Group said bluntly in its latest results presentation to analysts that the 
capacity cap was "caused by Heathrow Airport Limited security staff shortages".
There are obviously industry-wide issues, and more than enough blame to go round. But Heathrow's role as the 
infrastructure operator is to co-ordinate everyone involved to make sure it runs smoothly. That is what it belatedly 
did with the capacity cap. It is what it is doing with a review of ground handling launched last week.
Heathrow says it was not until it hit 100,000 passengers a day that it knew the airport's network of infrastructure 
providers could not cope. That should have been anticipated. Airlines started cutting capacity months before it did.
The cap is not what makes Heathrow hopeless. It is its failure as the UK's flagship airport to take responsibility 
sooner for the troubles that would unfold both in its terminals and on its Tarmac that rankles.

Six countries take controversial step to stamp out overtourism

As travel restrictions ease, some countries are being more selective about who they welcome post-pandemic.
Last week, New Zealand's tourism minister reiterated his desire to attract "high quality tourists" rather than those 
who campervan around the country "on $10 [(EURO)7] a day by eating dried noodles."
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, tourism boards around the world have been experimenting with 
selective entry policies. Now, they're implementing recovery plans - many of which echo this 'quality over quantity' 
mentality.
Reducing overtourism could have a positive impact on the environment and local communities in popular 
destinations. But does this mean travel will become reserved for the super rich?
With rising fuel costs signalling the end of the (EURO)10 flight era, according to a recent BBC Radio 4 interview 
with Ryanair chief exec Michael O'Leary, the days of budget travel could be behind us.
 So here are the countries targeting wealthy visitors as tourism bounces back.
The Cayman Islands welcomes high net worth remote workers
Long a haven for luxury travellers, the Caribbean Cayman Islands sought to secure their high-end image - even 
during the pandemic.
Launched in 2020, the Global Citizen Concierge Program (GCCP) gives remote workers the chance to make this 
British Overseas Territory their home. Those earning upwards of $100,000 ((EURO)98,666) per year can apply for 
a two-year visa for an annual fee of $1,469 ((EURO)1,449).
Under the scheme, the country's official tourism website invites "professionals and digital nomads alike [to] embrace 
a remote lifestyle and immerse themselves fully in the bespoke luxury, adventure, culture and beauty of the 
Cayman Islands."
Fiji targets a growth in visitor spend
During the pandemic, Fiji positioned itself as a retreat for billionaires.
Six countries take controversial step to stamp out overtourism
Back in June 2020, the country launched 'Blue Lanes' for "yachters looking to escape the pandemic in paradise." In 
a tweet, Fijian PM Frank Bainimarama invited billionaires with private jets to rent their own islands.
Pre-COVID, the tourism industry made up 38 per cent of Fiji's economy. To kickstart a revival, the country is placing 
continued focus on luxury travel.
Tourism Fiji's Corporate Plan for 2022 to 2024 pledges to "attract and expand high value customer segments" and 
encourage a "growth in visitor spend" to promote sustainable tourism.
Indonesia dances around a Bali backpacker ban
In September 2021, Indonesia joined the list of countries seeking 'quality' visitors post-pandemic.
"We'll aim for quality tourism in Bali, so we won't allow backpackers to enter once the reopening plan for 
international travellers is officially put in place in the near future," said Indonesia's coordinating minister of maritime 
and investment affairs, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, according to a report in the Bali Sun.
He later clarified that he was referring to filtering out visitors who might violate the country's health 
or immigration rules.
But the 2022 arrival of luxury hospitality brands like Banyan Tree and Jumeirah in Bali suggest the island is tipping 
further away from its backpacker past.
Montserrat lures lucrative digital nomads
Fancy making the mountainous Caribbean island of Montserrat your home for a year? If your annual income is 
above $70,000 ((EURO)69,000), now you can.
Launched in February 2021, the Remote Work Stamp invites high-earning digital nomads to "work remotely and 
safely from an exotic location."
The application fee is $500 ((EURO)493).
New Zealand snubs '$10-a-day' campervanners
New Zealand's post-pandemic tourism recovery scheme has its sights set on high-net-worth individuals.
"These are not the guys that jump in a camper van and...get around our country on $10 [(EURO)7] a day by eating 
dried noodles," said Tourism Minister Stuart Nash speaking at the Tourism Export Council of New Zealand annual 
conference in August 2022.
Instead, he wants to attract visitors who "spend a little more money, stay a little bit longer."
New Zealand finally reopened its borders in August 2022, with plans to better manage the tourism industry by 
avoiding overcrowding and improving sustainability.
Thailand tries to shake its backpacker legacy
Thailand's tourism industry is steadily recovering after months of COVID restrictions, which tested visitors' 
willingness to fork out for expensive quarantine schemes.
Keen to capitalise on this and shake the country's long-standing image as a backpacker haven, government 
ministers have asked hotels and business to refrain from luring tourists with big discounts.
"We cannot let people come to Thailand and say because it's cheap," said Deputy Prime Minister Anutin 
Charnvirakul at a tourism event in July 2022.
Six countries take controversial step to stamp out overtourism
Instead, he suggested the country should focus on raising its value as a premium travel destination, reports 
Reuters.
Thailand also hopes to lure high-earning digital nomads with its new 10-year 'work from Thailand' visa. Only open to 
those earning upwards of $80,000 ((EURO)78,965) per year, the visa solidifies the country's push for wealthy 
visitors.

BIG TECH is facing a moment of reckoning. Sky high valuations that seemed limitless have normalised and the 
premium that public tech stocks once held over the rest of the market have been largely erased. We've seen a 
spooked market fuel talk of a tech stock unwinding, but the reality is that many of the companies most impacted 
were likely overvalued. The recent corrections will shake out the companies that have relied on hype and FOMO 
(fear or missing our) rather than strong fundamentals and robust business models.
But we can and should still be excited about London's technology companies. Even in the midst of falling tech 
valuations, there are still pockets of huge opportunity.
Almost five billion people - 63 per cent of the world's population - have access to the internet, with 192 million 
additional users joining them each year. On average, these internet users spend almost 7 hours each day online, 
consuming huge amounts of data. A pocket of opportunity lies in the next generation of technology businesses in 
the capital that are building the future of digital applications and tech infrastructure. It is the companies in these tech 
sub-sectors, not the ones you see in the headlines, which are the most resilient to market shocks in the short term 
and that have the potential for long-term growth and value creation.
Here's an example you may not have heard of: "serverless" technology. Whether you're watching the Euros on your 
iPhone or digging into your emails, the likelihood is that the data is being served to you through cloud infrastructure.
Serverless technology enables a company to outsource both infrastructure and its code execution to a cloud 
provider, such as Amazon, IBM, or Microsoft. It saves time and resources so developers can focus on new products 
and services.
The bubble has burst for tech firms built on hype but solid businesses will keep growing
The serverless technology market is currently worth $7.29bn and is expected to reach $36.84bn by 2028. There is 
also an entire tech ecosystem being built around it, helping developers to resolve incidents and performance 
bottlenecks.
Regardless of market conditions, you still need brave, innovative, and fastmoving companies to challenge the 
status quo and take advantage of new trends. London is home to many of these companies. Within our own 
portfolio, we've seen the likes of Ably - who are building real-time notification infrastructure for the internet - deliver 
billions of messages to more than fifty million people every day for companies including HubSpot, Verizon and 
Bloomberg. APEXX Global's payment systems aggregator helps online merchants - including Asos and Ryanair -
to process transactions faster and easier.
These companies hold potential for high payoffs. But naturally, resource and development costs for these nascent 
businesses can be high and there can be more risk. This is where earlystage venture capital in particular presents 
an opportunity to identify homegrown entrepreneurs developing new technologies or taking advantage of market 
shocks.
The cyclical nature of markets means that there will always be times of buoyancy and times when growth slows. But 
the one sure thing is the ever-increasing pace of technological change. By understanding and focusing on the 
trends that drive it, businesses can present solutions that underpin progress.
The most exciting technology is not always the loudest, in fact it rarely is. The London startups quietly and patiently 
building strong businesses are often the most transformative. £ Nic Brisbourne is chief executive officer of

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) is planning to operate 500 additional flights from London's Stansted Airport to a number of 
destinations in Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece and France during the autumn mid-term break, it said Tuesday. 
The Ireland-based budget airline's latest move aims to add 100,000 low-fare seats in response to Heathrow 
Airport's recent flight restrictions, which limit the number of seats and flights available to customers. 
Shares in Ryanair fell marginally on Tuesday morning.

Europe's airport staff continue to strike over low pay and working conditions
Europe's airport staff continue to strike over low pay and working conditions

Across Europe, airport and airline staff have been striking, causing severe disruption to summer travel.
Employees including ground staff, baggage handlers, cabin crew and pilots have been walking out in countries like 
Spain, Italy and the UK.
With traveller numbers almost back to pre-pandemic levels, the industrial action has caused chaos at airports 
around Europe.
So what has prompted the summer strikes and will the walkouts continue?
Why are airport and airline staff striking?
The easing of pandemic restrictions has seen a sharp spike in air passenger numbers - and the aviation sector has 
been struggling to cope.
During the pandemic, many airport and airline workers were laid off resulting in a serious lack of staff this summer.
Overworked and underpaid, employees including check-in staff, cabin crew and pilots have been striking over the 
last few months.
Airport workers are still on covid contracts
"It all started with COVID," says Eoin Coates, head of aviation at the European Transport Workers' Federation.
The federation represents workers in all kinds of roles including catering, fueling, boarding and air traffic control.
"Airport workers are in quite precarious work," Coates says, adding that the problem isn't new: "Ground staff 
particularly have had their terms and conditions reduced over decades now."
Coates says airport and airline employees were already struggling with low pay and zero-hour contracts, but the 
pandemic was "the spark that triggered all this off".
"In countries like Belgium, Spain and Italy, where we are seeing a lot of strike action, employees were put on 
'COVID contracts' and received pay cuts," he says.
Europe's airport staff continue to strike over low pay and working conditions
Many workers were also laid off, meaning there is now a major shortage of staff at airports to deal with the returning 
traveller numbers.
Coates says we are seeing walkouts because now "workers are working harder and in many cases for less pay due 
to COVID-era agreements that are still binding, many until 2024."
Ryanair cabin crew, Lufthansa ground crew and easyJet employees have all cited low pay as their reason for 
striking.
Ryanair workers want contract changes honoured
Ryanair's problems began before the COVID crisis and still haven't been resolved. Lidia Arasanz, a unionist at 
Unión Sindical Obrera (USO), says Ryanair cabin crew in Spain have been calling on the company to honour 
contract agreements since 2019.
"We used to be on Irish contracts, but in 2019 Ryanair signed an agreement to pass all workers under Spanish 
law," she explains. "But they have only implemented the parts that they want."
The union is asking the airline to align workers' contracts with Spanish law, including giving employees 30 days of 
annual leave, 14 bank holidays per year and two extra payments most Spanish workers receive annually.
Ryanair cabin crew dismissed over strikes
The union is also calling for employees fired over previous strike action to be reinstated.
"We are asking Ryanair to take them back to work because they were dismissed just because they were exercising 
their right to strike," Arasanz says.
According to the unionist, 11 employees were dismissed and around 100 are facing disciplinary action.
Will there be more airport strikes this summer?
Coates says the walkouts over COVID contracts have pushed companies to begin negotiations but not much has 
been resolved yet.
As such, it is likely airport staff will continue striking over the summer. "The summer schedule will last at least until 
mid-September and the pressure will still be there on workers," Coates says.
"Even if we manage to renegotiate agreements now, by the time we have the number of workers in place to reach 
those demands the summer will be over."
EasyJet pilots in Spain have already announced they will strike for nine days in August over pay and working 
conditions.
In Portugal, aviation staff from operator ANA have planned strike action to push for wage increases from 19-21 
August. The walkouts are likely to cause serious disruption at major airports including Lisbon, Porto and Faro.
Ryanair staff have also planned regular industrial action for the next five months. The walkouts will take place every 
week, from Monday to Thursday, and will each last 24 hours.
"For the moment nothing has changed. We have been sending emails to Ryanair to try to arrive at an agreement 
but we didn't get any answer," says Arasanz.
"The only response was letters to the striking committee threatening us and saying we are under investigation."

Ryanair CEO Micheal O'Leary says that higher fuel prices as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine mean that the 
era of the (EURO)1 fare is history. Speaking to the BBC, O'Leary said that he expects that his airline's average one 
way fare will also have rise "last year our average fare was (EURO)40 and we think that will have to edge up to 
around (EURO)50 this year". O'Leary retained his trademark bullishness when said that compared with legacy 
rivals Ryanair's fare increases are modest and he remained confident that the airline will continue to win business 
and customers become more price sensitive as the result of inflation.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary says era of ultra-low fares is over

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said the era of ultra-low fares is over and warned that ticket prices will have to 
increase due to rising fuel costs as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
"There's no doubt that at the lower end of the marketplace, our really cheap promotional fares - the one euro fares, 
the (EURO)0.99 fares, even the (EURO)9.99 fares - I think you will not see those fares for the next number of 
years," O'Leary told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"We think that (EURO)40 needs to edge up towards maybe (EURO)50 over the next five years. So, the £35 
average fare in the UK will rise to maybe £42 or £43," he added.
The Irish low-cost carrier is known for its ultra-low-cost ticket sales. But according to O'Leary, ultra-low fares prove 
to be unsustainable during this period marred with geopolitical tensions, supply chain issues, and volatile oil prices 
as well as potential COVID-19 outbreaks.
O'Leary's comments were made shortly after the budget carrier announced its financial results for the first quarter of 
FY2023.
During the quarter, Ryanair returned to profitability but warned of the "fragile" state of the air travel market and the 
risk of potential new COVID-19 variants in the autumn.
In Q1 FY2023, Ryanair posted a profit after tax (PAT) of (EURO)170 million, an increase compared to a loss of 
(EURO)273 million in Q1 FY2022. The positive financial results were attributed to strong air travel demand.

Aug 12, 2022( International Business Times News: https://www.ibtimes.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Easyjet's Spanish pilots walked out on Friday, calling for the reinstatement of conditions they enjoyed before the 
coronavirus pandemic, two weeks after a strike by the low-cost carrier's cabin crew had resulted in a deal. 
Coming at the height of the summer tourist season, the new Easyjet stoppages will add to the problems facing the 
sector. 
Cabin crew at budget rival Ryanair have been staging 24-hour walkouts since June, which are likely to continue 
until January 2023, unions said. 
The Easyjet pilots, for their part, are staging a first three-day strike from Friday at the airports of Barcelona, Malaga 
and the Mediterranean islands of Palma de Majorca and Minorca, the SEPLA union said. 
Two more three-day walkouts are planned later in August. 
"This is the only possible alternative for the pilots' representatives, after more than six months of negotiations, at 
which the company has rejected all proposals made," the union said. 
The airline cancelled eight flights on Friday, most of them from Barcelona, Spain's second-busiest airport. 
"During the worst months of the pandemic, we agreed to lower our salaries to guarantee not only jobs, but the 
survival of the company itself in Spain," the union said.  
Now, however, the company "refuses to recover the working conditions. 
"We are not asking for anything that we did not have two years ago," said a union spokesman.  
In late July, EasyJet said it took a sizeable financial hit from sector-wide disruptions, notably staff shortages, but still 
slashed quarterly losses as demand recovered. 
Just days later, EasyJet cabin crews ended their strike, after reaching a deal with management to raise wages by 
22 percent over three years.

 Easyjet's Spanish pilots walked out on Friday, calling for the reinstatement of conditions they enjoyed before the 
coronavirus pandemic, two weeks after a strike by the low-cost carrier's cabin crew had resulted in a deal. 
Coming at the height of the summer tourist season, the new Easyjet stoppages will add to the problems facing the 
sector. 
Cabin crew at budget rival Ryanair have been staging 24-hour walkouts since June, which are likely to continue 
until January 2023, unions said. 
The Easyjet pilots, for their part, are staging a first three-day strike from Friday at the airports of Barcelona, Malaga 
and the Mediterranean islands of Palma de Majorca and Minorca, the SEPLA union said. 
Two more three-day walkouts are planned later in August. 
'This is the only possible alternative for the pilots' representatives, after more than six months of negotiations, at 
which the company has rejected all proposals made,' the union said. 
The airline cancelled eight flights on Friday, most of them from Barcelona, Spain's second-busiest airport. 
'During the worst months of the pandemic, we agreed to lower our salaries to guarantee not only jobs, but the 
survival of the company itself in Spain,' the union said. 
Now, however, the company 'refuses to recover the working conditions. 
'We are not asking for anything that we did not have two years ago,' said a union spokesman. 
In late July, EasyJet said it took a sizeable financial hit from sector-wide disruptions, notably staff shortages, but still 
slashed quarterly losses as demand recovered. 
Just days later, EasyJet cabin crews ended their strike, after reaching a deal with management to raise wages by 
22 percent over three years.

Heathrow airport says passenger cap has eased travel chaos

LONDON (AP) — Heathrow Airport in London said Thursday that its limit on the number of passengers is easing a 
travel crunch that has led to flight cancellations and lost luggage as soaring demand for summer trips runs up 
against pandemic-era staffing shortages.
Britain’s busiest airport has capped the daily number of departing passengers at 100,000 until Sept. 11 and asked 
airlines to stop selling tickets and cut flights, stirring criticism. The cap has cut down on last-minute flight 
cancellations and improved baggage delivery and on-time planes, Heathrow said in a statement.
The airport said it has hired 1,300 people and that the number of security screeners is at pre-pandemic levels, 
allowing 88% of travelers to get through checkpoints within 20 minutes.
“Passengers are seeing better, more reliable journeys since the introduction of the demand cap," airport CEO John 
Holland-Kaye said. “This has only been possible because of the collective and determined efforts of airport, airline 
and wider Team Heathrow teams.”
Soaring numbers of travelers after two years of COVID-19 travel restrictions have overwhelmed airports and 
airlines, which had laid off thousands of employees during the depths of the pandemic.
Heathrow has been the frequent scene of chaos this summer, with long lines for security and technical glitches with 
the baggage system that resulted in huge piles of lost and unclaimed luggage. Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport also 
has been hard hit and has imposed a passenger cap.
In London, Heathrow's passenger limits led British Airways to temporarily suspend short-haul flight sales to 
destinations within the United Kingdom and Europe earlier this month.
The CEO of Ryanair, a budget carrier that flies out of other London airports, accused Heathrow of 
“mismanagement" in an interview with the BBC published Thursday. Michael O’Leary said he had he had “very little 
sympathy” for airports because they knew the schedules months ahead of time and security staffers don't need as 
much training as pilots.
Heathrow airport says passenger cap has eased travel chaos
Heathrow said building up airline ground crews that service planes is key to easing the passenger cap and that it 
has launched a review with that goal.
It added that more than 6 million passengers traveled through Heathrow last month and 16 million are expected 
between July and September.

No more (EURO)10 flights, says Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has signalled an end to the era of (EURO)10 flights, stating that average fares on the 
Irish budget carrier would rise to roughly (EURO)50 (£42.20) over the next five years.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, O'Leary said: "There's no doubt that at the lower end of the 
marketplace, our really cheap promotional fares - the one euro fares, the (EURO)0.99 fares, even the (EURO)9.99 
fares - I think you will not see those fares for the next number of years."
Rising fuel costs are undoubtedly having an impact on fare prices, although the sector as a whole is facing pressure 
to reduce its carbon emissions.
On that note, O'Leary called the focus on air travel "misplaced", arguing that road transport and the shipping sector 
were greater contributors to carbon emissions overall.
Ryanair faces sector challenges
Ryanair has fared reasonably well in the post-pandemic environment.
The airline beat first-quarter expectations this year, while the mass cancellations, strikes and staff shortages hitting 
easyJet and others have had less of an impact on the Irish carrier.
Capacity was at 96% in July, while passenger count grew by 16.8 million, making for an 81% increase compared to 
2021 numbers.
No more (EURO)10 flights, says Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary
O'Leary pointed to Ryanair's robust hiring policy in the midst of the Omicron variant outbreak, a gamble which 
seems to have paid off.
But the "fundamentally broken" post-Brexit UK labour market poses a threat to the airline industry, according to 
O'Leary, calling on the next UK prime minister to prioritise a free trade deal with the EU to alleviate staff shortages 
in UK airports.

The CEO of Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline by passenger numbers, says the era of super cheap air travel is over.
"I don't think there are going to be 10 euro [$10.33] flights anymore because oil prices are significantly higher as a 
result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine," Michael O'Leary told BBC Radio 4 s Today program on Thursday.
Ryanair's average fare was 40 euros last year, equivalent to about £34, but O'Leary said that will now need to 
increase.
"We think that 40 euros needs to edge up towards maybe 50 euros over the next five years. So the £35 average 
fare in the U.K. will rise to maybe £42 or £43," he said.
Ryanair is known for its low-price flash sales, but these prices are now thought to be unsustainable in the current 
climate, according to O'Leary.
"There's no doubt that at the lower end of the marketplace, our really cheap promotional fares, the one euro fares, 
the 99 cent fares, even the 9.99 fares, I think you will not see those fares for the next number of years."
Ryanair is not planning on hiking prices across its offerings, however.
"Ryanair will still have millions of seats available at 19.99, 24.99 and 29.99," O'Leary said. "Now that will still be a 
fraction of the high fares that BA and our other competitors are charging."
The news is not the start of a more widespread end to budget flying as we currently know it, according to John 
Strickland, director of JLS Consulting.
"The relative pricing level may change modestly for lead in fares but as airlines, low cost carriers in particular, 
generate increasing revenues from ancillary sources (non-ticket), they can still use low price to entice bookings 
whilst maximising these other opportunities," he said.
Ryanair declined to comment further when contacted by CNBC.
The airline has said it is currently operating business as usual with "no plans to cap passenger numbers," in what 
has been a chaotic few months for airports and carriers.
Ryanair says ticket prices will have to rise
Airlines including BA, easyJet, Lufthansa and KLM have made adjustments to their schedules due to strikes and 
staff shortages.
O'Leary's ticket comments come shortly after Ryanair reported profits for the June quarter beat estimates.
Ryanair is being careful in its approach, CFO Neil Sorahan said on CNBC's "Squawk Box" on July 25.
"We remain cautious as to what may happen with Ukraine. If it remains contained within Ukraine then I think we'll 
continue to see central and eastern Europe bookings strongly for the remainder of the year," Sorahan said.
"But there are a lot of unknowns with very volatile prices and I think it's right to be cautious."

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC's trademark EUR1 and EUR10 fares will not be seen for a "number of 
years" due to soaring fuel prices, the budget airline's boss has said.
In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Michael O'Leary said he expected Ryanair's average fare to 
rise by about EUR10 over the next five years, from around EUR40 last year to roughly EUR50 by 2027.
He told the broadcaster: "There's no doubt that at the lower end of the marketplace, our really cheap promotional 
fares – the EUR1 fares, the EUR0.99 fares, even the EUR9.99 fares – I think you will not see those fares for the 
next number of years."
Although the soaring fuel prices which are impacting the airline's fares are also wreaking havoc on people's 
disposable incomes, O'Leary is confident the number of customers will remain steady.
Instead, he believes travellers will flock en masse to lower-cost alternatives such as Ryanair and easyJet PLC.
"We think people will continue to fly frequently," he said.
"But I think people are going to become much more price sensitive and therefore my view of life is that people will 
trade down in their many millions."

Higher airfares may discourage the middle-class from travelling

Highlight: Travellers have already been hit by Europe's increasing cost of living, which has reduced their 
discretionary income.
Body
Airfares have risen at a time when the European travel market has become increasingly price sensitive due to the 
rising cost of living, potentially deterring the middle class from carrying out their vacation plans. IATA forecasts that 
airfares will rise by 5.6% this year globally. Ryanair Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary also stated he expects 
summer fares in 2022 to be between 7% and 9% higher than compared to before the pandemic. 
Increases in airfares will impact travel sentiments for the European middle class that is now feeling the financial 
pinch back at home. The rising cost of living is taking its tollTravellers have already been hit by Europe's increasing 
cost of living, which has reduced their discretionary income. Now that tourism demand is rebounding and the cost of 
jet fuel is ever-expanding, the airline industry has raised ticket prices. This has created negative sentiment around 
vacation plans, which may compel the middle-class to revise, delay, or even cancel their arrangements. As per 
GlobalData's Q2 Consumer Survey, when asked "How concerned are you about the following factors?", for "The 
impact of inflation on my household budget", 66% of Europeans were quite or extremely concerned about this. This 
demonstrates that customers are already anxious about their levels of disposable income dwindling, and increased 
airfares will potentially exacerbate this issue. Affordability is a major decision maker for price-sensitive 
consumersMany middle-class consumers in Europe were put to the ultimate test in their money management 
abilities during the pandemic, when a significant portion of their income was reduced, forcing them to dip into their 
savings, with this impact lasting even after Covid-based limitations were lifted. According to GlobalData's Q3 2021 
consumer survey, when asked "Which factor helps you decide where to go on holiday?", 55% of European 
respondents said they consider "Affordability" as the main deciding factor when choosing their destination. This 
represents the fact that travellers are price sensitive and increasing airfares will be a challenging factor for them to 
decide what to do with their travel plans. As the tourism industry has started to recover, stakeholders are now 
expecting to see the European tourism industry reach pre-pandemic levels by 2025. However, several factors like 
the increasing cost of living, inflation, and the rising cost of fuel have acted as a matter of concern. This has 
affected both the consumer and the service provider; the airlines are dealing with the rising cost of fuel while the 
Higher airfares may discourage the middle-class from travelling
consumers are dealing with the rising cost of living, deterring both to reach each other's expectations. Governments 
must step in to provide some type of solution to the rising cost of living and fuel crisis to make sure consumers and 
tourism businesses fulfil each other's requirements. Until then, price-sensitive consumers may be discouraged to 
carry out their travel plans, with rising airfares spurring their decision.

How High Can Copper Go? 
Heathrow airport says passenger cap has eased travel chaos
To power the green revolution, copper demand continues to skyrocket with no end in sight. Prices hit a 10-year 
high; as copper jumped 79% in the past year. Some analysts are calling for copper to rise another 50-100%! We 
may be at the beginning of a copper bull run the likes we've never seen before. Just how high can copper go? 
Heathrow said building up airline ground crews that service planes is key to easing the passenger cap and that it 
has launched a review with that goal.  
It added that more than 6 million passengers traveled through Heathrow last month and 16 million are expected 
between July and September. 
The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading indicates that inflation may be peaking. But if you go to the grocery 
store or pay rent you're aware that prices aren't going down anytime soon. In fact, there's growing sentiment that 
inflation will be sticky. 
What does that mean for interest rates? One part of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate is to keep inflation at or 
near its 2% target level. That means that it's reasonable to suggest that the Fed is not done with rate hikes. 
Rising interest rates generally spell trouble for equity investors. Businesses, like consumers, are affected by higher 
interest rates. Not to be overly simplistic, but hiring borrowing costs means lower earnings. And that means a lower 
stock price. 
However, some stocks manage rising interest rates better than others. In this special presentation, we look at seven 
stocks that are built to outperform when interest rates are rising. And what's even better, many of these stocks have 
business models that provide growth when the economy is firing on all cylinders.

Ryanair to appeal as Hungary slaps it with $771,000 fine
Ryanair to appeal as Hungary slaps it with $771,000 fine

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) plans to lodge an appeal with the courts of the European Union after Hungary fined it 
HUF300 million forints (USD771,000) it for "deceiving consumers through unfair commercial practices" in relation to 
a new profit tax.
As previously reported, Ryanair demanded in June that the nationalist government of Viktor Orbán scrap what it 
called a "misguided" tax placed on airlines of EUR10 to EUR25 (USD10.25-26.60) per passenger departing 
Hungary starting from July. The special tax measure, estimated to be worth HUF800 billion (USD2.06 billion) in 
total, targets "extra profits" earned by "banks, insurers, large retail chains, energy and trading companies, 
telecommunications companies, and airlines," Orbán said, in an effort to compensate for inflation blamed on the 
war in Ukraine as well as to fund further defence spending.
On June 10, Budapest municipality (Budapest Fováros Kormányhivatala - BFKH) launched a consumer protection 
investigation against Ryanair for pledging to pass the costs of the tax on to passengers, and on August 8 it duly 
imposed the fine as the authority had "found that the airline committed a violation of the law because it deceived 
consumers with its unfair commercial practices."
The country's justice minister, Judit Varga, declared in a Facebook post on the same day: "The Ministry of Justice, 
as the professional managing body, has been closely following the investigation, which has resulted in the 
Hungarian Authority for Consumer Protection today finding a violation of consumer rules. [...] As the government 
has promised, we will protect the Hungarian people and launch a consumer protection investigation in every case 
where the extra profit tax is passed on."
She added: "Wartime inflation and the economic situation requires that whichever multinational companies make 
extra profits should pay their share of the costs of the protection of utility cost reduction and national defence! In 
Hungary, the laws apply to everyone. Any evasion or passing on of extra profits will continue to be addressed by 
consumer protection investigations and fines!"
Ryanair told ch-aviation in its own statement that it "will immediately appeal any baseless fine raised by the 
Hungarian Consumer Protection Agency. As the Hungarian Govt is well aware, EU Reg 1008/2008 allows all EU 
airlines the freedom to set airfares for their intra-EU air services as they so choose, without any interference from 
national govts or their consumer protection agencies. This EU law prohibits the Hungarian Govt from introducing 
Ryanair to appeal as Hungary slaps it with $771,000 fine
retrospective travel taxes while attempting to unlawfully limit the right of airlines to pass such unjustified taxes onto 
passengers. If necessary, Ryanair will appeal this matter to the EU courts."
Companies have so far been reluctant to challenge the tax. Budapest-based Wizz Air has merely commented that it 
will hamper the recovery of the travel and tourism sector as the airline industry struggles to return to pre-Covid 
revenue and profitability levels.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) expects the weekly strikes by a "handful" of its Spanish cabin crew to have no impact on its daily 
flight schedules in August or September, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing a spokesperson. 
The USO and SITCPLA unions in Spain said earlier their members plan to strike every week from Monday until Jan. 
7, 2023, to get a better wage deal and improved working conditions following strikes in July 2022. 
The Irish airline group canceled a few flights in Spain in July, primarily due to air traffic controller strikes and flight 
delays, the report said. 
Ryanair shares were down over 2% on Tuesday's close.

UBS cuts British Airways owner IAG's price target but maintains its buy rating

UBS remains positive on the outlook for European airlines following a month of better-than-expected results in the 
sector, although the target price for British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group SA 
(LSE:IAG) was cut.
This followed a second-quarter results season resulted that was better than expected, apart from Wizz Air.
"The outlook from the European airlines was constructive on summer trading on bookings and pricing which 
resulted in share prices rising across the board over the last 30 days.
"The tone from management in our view was reassuring and European airlines continue to ramp up capacity 
through the quarters (Click link). We have updated forecasts to reflect the results and revised outlook. In general 
forecasts are rising for 2023 (partly due to a falling oil) price, but mixed changes for 2022."
Although BA owner IAG returned to profit, analysts at the bank reduced their forecasts for underlying earnings 
(EBIT) for both this year and next, to (EURO)509mln from (EURO)621mln for 2022, and to (EURO)2.2bn from 
(EURO)2.7bn for 2023.
The analysts also noted the potential for earnings per share to be greatly affected for all airlines by potential moves 
in jet fuel prices and passenger yield, which is a measure of revenue by revenue passenger miles and is generally 
an effect of changes to fares.
UBS cuts British Airways owner IAG's price target but maintains its buy rating
Due to operational disruptions described by the company as 'short-term', budget airline easyJet PLC 
(LSE:EZJ) is now forecast to make a loss of £138mln, compared to the £26mln profit previously forecast, but expect 
a return to profit in 2023 to £369mln.
For Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ), adjusted net income targets were slashed to a loss of (EURO)450mln from 
(EURO)350mln, although like easyJet, targets for next year were raised to (EURO)266mln from (EURO)135mln.
Meanwhile, the investment bank believes Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) will be the short-haul carrier least 
adversely impacted this year, with adjusted income targets raised to (EURO)1.4bn from (EURO)1.3bn, and to 
(EURO)1.7bn from (EURO)1.6bn for next year.
In terms of target prices and valuations, reflected on the 2023 outlook, UBS gave a 'neutral' rating to Wizz Air with a 
price hike to 2,925p while its valuation of easyJet remained unchanged at 805p, but with a 'buy' rating.
Ryanai's target price was raised to (EURO)21 from (EURO)19.20 with a 'buy' rating, while IAG's target price was 
cut to 170p from 180p, although the shares were still a 'buy'.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) expects "zero impact" on its Spanish flights or schedules in August or September from 
planned weekly strikes by some of its Spanish cabin crew, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing a company 
spokesperson.
Members of the USO and SITCPLA unions said in July they will strike from Monday to Thursday every week from 
Aug. 8 to Jan. 7 to push the company for higher pay and better working conditions.
However, Ryanair reportedly said the bulk of its Spanish cabin crew are represented by the CCOO union, with 
which it has already struck a new pay deal.
Ryanair shares were down 2.6% in recent trading.

Body
BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary accused Ryanair of consumer protection violations and fined it more than 
three-quarters of a million euros after the budget carrier raised ticket prices to cope with a tax on what the 
government calls “extra profits" of industries ranging from airlines to banks.
Justice Minister Judit Varga wrote Monday on Facebook that an investigation against Ireland-based Ryanair started 
in June and found “unfair trade practices," triggering a fine of 300 million Hungarian forints ($777,058).
The fine is the first tied to the tax, which led Ryanair and others to increase prices and set off a clash with industry. 
Hungary has said costs should not be passed along to customers.
Ryanair says it will “immediately appeal any baseless fine" but that it hasn't received notice of one. It pointed to 
European Union law allowing airlines to set fares for flights within the 27-nation bloc without interference from 
national governments and says it will appeal to EU courts if needed.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban's right-wing nationalist government says industries from banking to insurance to airlines 
that have enjoyed “extra profits” arising from soaring demand after the COVID-19 pandemic should contribute to the 
country's economic recovery. His government blames the war in Ukraine and EU sanctions against Russia for woes 
like the skyrocketing energy prices, its currency weakening to record levels and inflation reaching 12.6% in June.
The government has said it hopes the tax will raise 815 billion forints ($2.1 billion) to maintain a program that 
reduces people’s utility bills and bolsters the military.
The economic problems “require that whichever multinational companies that make extra profit should pay their 
share of the costs of the overhead protection and the national defense," Varga wrote Monday.
Economists have said some targeted industries like fossil fuels and banking are making higher-than-usual profits, 
but most are not. Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary has called the tax “highway robbery” and “idiotic,” calling on the 
government to end it.
Ryanair, British low-cost airline easyJet and Hungary-based budget carrier Wizz Air, have said they would add 
around 10 euros (dollars) to each ticket to cover the costs of the new tax.

Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) has been fined (EURO)765,000 for raising ticket prices in 
response to the Hungarian government's tax on "extra profits" of airlines, banks, and other industries.  
Ryanair is to appeal against what it terms a 'baseless' consumer protection fine, saying, "No notice of any such fine 
has yet been received by Ryanair. If necessary, Ryanair will appeal this matter to the EU courts."
In May, Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government announced a tax on "extra profits" earned by major banks, 
energy companies and other companies reportedly in order to plug budget holes.
"The consumer protection authority has found a breach of the law today, because the airline (Ryanair) has misled 
customers with its unfair business practice," Justice minister Judit Varga said in a Facebook post.
"The wartime inflation and the wartime economic situation demand that whichever multinational company makes 
extra profit should take its share of the costs of protecting the public and defending the country!", wrote the minister.
The new levy involves a tax worth (EURO)10-25 on passengers departing Hungary from July.
Previously, Ryanair had called on Orban's government to scrap the "misguided" tax which it said would harm 
Hungarian tourism.   The airline has argued it will be forced to move capacity to countries working to restore traffic 
following the coronavirus pandemic as a result of the tax.

Irish ultra-low-cost carrier Ryanair has been hit with a HUF 300 million ($779,464) fine by Hungarian authorities for 
breaching consumer rights.
A consumer protection probe of Ryanair, which was initiated by Hungary's economic development minister Marton 
Nagy, concluded that the airline breached customer rights after it started passing on the cost of a special windfall 
tax on airlines to consumers, Reuters reported on August 8, 2022.
"The consumer protection authority has found a breach of the law today because the airline has misled customers 
with its unfair business practice," Hungarian justice minister Judit Varga said in a post on social media.
Under the Hungarian government decree, airlines operating in the country are required to pay a HUF 3,900 
($10.11) tax for every passenger on every flight across state-members of the European Union as well as for those 
who travel to various destinations across 16 other countries, including Albania, Andorra, Bosnia, and Herzegovina, 
North Macedonia, Iceland, Kosovo, Liechtenstein and Moldova as well as Monaco, Montenegro, the United 
Kingdom, Norway, San Marino, Switzerland, Serbia, and Ukraine.
Meanwhile, airlines flying from Hungary to other destinations are obliged to contribute a HUF 9,750 ($25.27) tax per 
passenger.
Reuters also reported that Ryanair was ready to appeal against the fine.
The windfall tax on airlines, as well as on banks, insurance, retail, telecommunications, pharmaceutical, and energy 
companies was implemented by the local government in July 2022 in an attempt to strengthen the country's budget.

North Macedonia, Iceland, Kosovo, Liechtenstein and Moldova as well as Monaco, Montenegro, the United 
Kingdom, Norway, San Marino, Switzerland, Serbia, and Ukraine.
Meanwhile, airlines flying from Hungary to other destinations are obliged to contribute a HUF 9,750 ($25.27) tax per 
passenger.
Reuters also reported that Ryanair was ready to appeal against the fine.
The windfall tax on airlines, as well as on banks, insurance, retail, telecommunications, pharmaceutical, and energy 
companies was implemented by the local government in July 2022 in an attempt to strengthen the country's budget.

The start of a long-planned strike by Ryanair cabin crew in Spain caused only limited disruption at the country's 
airports.
Ten flights had been cancelled on Monday and there had been 111 delays by the afternoon, the USO trade union 
said.
The Dublin-based budget airline predicted that operations over the months ahead would be disrupted minimally if at 
all.
Ryanair's Spain-based cabin crew are demanding an improvement in working conditions. Following unsuccessful 
strike action in in June and July, the unions involved, USO and Sitcpla, said crew would strike between Monday and 
Thursday every week from Monday up to January 7 next year.
They accused Ryanair of failing to comply with Spanish law in refusing to negotiate.
Among the demands are observing "basic labour rights," including at least 22 days' holiday per year, 
implementation of occupational health and safety legislation and raising pay to the level that applied before the 
pandemic.
The airports affected include the main hubs at Madrid, Barcelona and Mallorca, and also Málaga, Sevilla, Alicante, 
Valencia, Girona, Ibiza and Santiago de Compostela.
The maintenance of "minimal service" prescribed under Spanish law during strikes means that only some flights 
can be cancelled, usually only a relatively small number.

The thirst for freedom in Belarus is unquenchable

T he peaceful pro-democracy protests that swept through Belarus in August 2020 evoked memories of Solidarity, 
the mass movement that had arisen in neighbouring Poland 40 years earlier. The focus of discontent was identical: 
a repressive regime, aligned with Moscow, that mistreated citizens and brought shame on the nation. Even the 
patriotic colours on display in the protests were the same in Minsk as in Warsaw - white and red.
Two years on, the parallels between Belarus and Poland appear even more striking. Just as the Polish communist 
authorities suppressed Solidarity under martial law in December 1981, so the regime of Alexander Lukashenko has 
carried out a ferocious crackdown on the democratic opposition of Belarus. The prospect of any reprieve seems as 
remote as in Poland four decades ago, not least because relations between western countries and the Kremlin are 
as bad now as in the early 1980s - or even worse, with war raging in Ukraine.
In 1989, however, Poland liberated itself from communism with not a drop of blood shed. It was the prelude to a 
"springtime of nations" in central and eastern Europe, whose peoples rose up for national independence and civic 
freedoms. Desperately bleak as the outlook is today, is there any chance that something similar could occur in 
Belarus by the end of the 2020s?
Much as events in Poland and Belarus resemble each other, the differences are important. One precondition for 
Poland's turn to freedom was the ascent to power in 1985 of Mikhail Gorbachev, a Soviet leader who, unlike his 
predecessors, did not crush dissent in nominally friendly countries with tanks, as in Budapest in 1956 and Prague in 
1968. As long as Vladimir Putin rules Russia, the prison-like conditions prevalent in Belarus are unlikely to change.
The thirst for freedom in Belarus is unquenchable
Another difference is the extreme strategic vulnerability of Belarus. It has been locked into a "union state" with 
Russia since 1999. Lukashenko drew two years ago on Russian financial and political support to stamp out the 
protests that followed his fraudulent election victory. As a result, he fell more heavily into Putin's debt than at any 
time since his dictatorship began in 1994. In tandem with the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Putin has placed 
Belarus under Russian military control.
A third point is that even though Wojciech Jaruzelski, the general who served as Poland's Communist party leader, 
was reviled for imposing martial law, he did not employ Lukashenko's gangster-like methods of rule. The tyrant of 
Belarus ordered the hijacking of a Ryanair plane last year to arrest an opposition activist. He orchestrated a surge 
of Iraqi, Syrian and other migrants to Poland's border.
Whereas the jails of Belarus are full of Lukashenko critics, Jaruzelski declared an amnesty in July 1984 that freed 
hundreds of political prisoners. To be sure, it was a limited measure. Dissidents such as Adam Michnik were soon 
back in jail. The regime's secret police kidnapped and murdered Poland's most popular pro-Solidarity priest. But the 
amnesty preceded the era of Soviet liberalisation under Gorbachev. It was a sign that Jaruzelski was seeking a way 
out of the stalemate with Polish society created by the ban on Solidarity. Nothing similar is to be expected from 
Lukashenko.
At the same time, there are grounds not to lose all hope for the people of Belarus. Their desire for change 
represents the delayed awakening of a nation to which independence came as something of a surprise when the 
Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. By now this process is irreversible. Furthermore, the anti-Lukashenko mood of 
Belarusian society is not anti-Russian. A more enlightened leader in Moscow might understand that.
The differences with Poland in 1980-81 are instructive. Unlike the democratic Belarusian opposition, Solidarity 
became increasingly outspoken under the influence of radical activists. At a national congress in September 1981, 
Solidarity issued an appeal to the workers of eastern Europe to follow the Polish example and set up free trade 
unions. Tass, the official Soviet news agency, denounced the appeal as the work of "a whole conglomerate of 
counter-revolutionaries, including agents of imperialist secret services".
Even though its leaders are either in prison or have fled abroad, the Belarusian opposition has not become 
radicalised. Its basic demands are for free elections, individual liberty and justice. Today these rights seem far out 
of reach in Belarus. But they are not permanently unobtainable. Should change come, perhaps it will happen 
because they are the same rights of which Russia itself is in sore need.

Ryanair Plans Immediate Appeal to Hungary 's 'Baseless' Fine

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) said it will immediately lodge an appeal against any "baseless" fine coming from the Hungarian 
Consumer Protection Agency after it was ordered to pay 300 million forint ($774,747.60) for allegedly misleading 
customers.
Reuters, citing an email from Ryanair, reported Monday the Irish budget airline is yet to receive a notice of the 
penalty but is already willing to take the fight to European Union courts if necessary.
Hungary claims the airline passed on to customers the 800 billion-forint cost of a special business tax. The 
country's consumer commission found the act an unfair business practice, prompting the imposition of the penalty.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) has been fined 300 million forints ($780,000) by Hungary following a consumer protection 
investigation, Reuters reported on Monday, citing the justice minister.
The investigation found that the airline had been passing on the cost of a special tax levied on the industry to 
consumers, according to the report. The tax had been levied by the government on major companies' extra profits.
Ryanair said that the tax, applied at a rate per departing passenger, was "misguided" for the loss-making industry 
and would hurt the country's tourism and economy.
Ryanair was down nearly 1% in Monday morning trading.

 A Ryanair plane takes off from Budapest Airport, in Budapest, Hungary, June 12, 2022. Hungary has accused 
Ryanair of consumer protection violations after it raised ticket prices to cope with a tax on what the government 
calls 'extra profits.' Justice Minister Judit Varga wrote Monday, Aug. 8, 2022, on Facebook that an investigation 
found 'unfair trade practices,' leading to a $777,058 fine. (AP Photo/Anna Szilagyi, File) 
BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary accused Ryanair of consumer protection violations and fined it more than 
three-quarters of a million euros after the budget carrier raised ticket prices to cope with a tax on what the 
government calls 'extra profits" of industries ranging from airlines to banks. 
Justice Minister Judit Varga wrote Monday on Facebook that an investigation against Ireland-based Ryanair started 
in June and found 'unfair trade practices," triggering a fine of 300 million Hungarian forints ($777,058). 
The fine is the first tied to the tax, which led Ryanair and others to increase prices and set off a clash with industry. 
Hungary has said costs should not be passed along to customers.  
Ryanair says it will 'immediately appeal any baseless fine" but that it hasn't received notice of one. It pointed to 
European Union law allowing airlines to set fares for flights within the 27-nation bloc without interference from 
national governments and says it will appeal to EU courts if needed. 
Prime Minister Viktor Orban's right-wing nationalist government says industries from banking to insurance to airlines 
that have enjoyed 'extra profits' arising from soaring demand after the COVID-19 pandemic should contribute to the 
country's economic recovery. His government blames the war in Ukraine and EU sanctions against Russia for woes 
like the skyrocketing energy prices, its currency weakening to record levels and inflation reaching 12.6% in June. 
The government has said it hopes the tax will raise 815 billion forints ($2.1 billion) to maintain a program that 
reduces people's utility bills and bolsters the military. 
The economic problems 'require that whichever multinational companies that make extra profit should pay their 
share of the costs of the overhead protection and the national defense," Varga wrote Monday. 
Economists have said some targeted industries like fossil fuels and banking are making higher-than-usual profits, 
but most are not. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has called the tax 'highway robbery' and 'idiotic,' calling on the 
government to end it.

Up or Down - Doesn't Matter 
These low-priced, 'penny' stocks could be a great way to make money regardless of the direction the markets take 
Up or down. Doesn't matter These four just might deliver in a huge way. 
Hungary fines Ryanair over raising prices to cope with tax
Ryanair, British low-cost airline easyJet and Hungary-based budget carrier Wizz Air, have said they would add 
around 10 euros (dollars) to each ticket to cover the costs of the new tax. 
When inflation rises, it's not difficult to notice higher prices. But you don't have to be very old to understand the 
expression that a dollar doesn't buy as much as it used to. The Happy Meal was introduced in 1979 for a price of 
$1.10[1]. Today, that same meal costs $2.99. Yet, it remains one of the restaurant chain's most popular items. It's 
also a barometer for the economy because of its convenience for parents. 
And consider the iPhone which costs 81% more in 2022[2] than the initial model that launched in 2007. Yet despite 
the increase in price, consumers are willing to pay whatever is required. 
The key to both of these examples, and others like them, is pricing power. A company that has the ability to raise its 
prices can maintain its profit margins. That means it delivers consistent results regardless of what's happening in 
the broader economy. In good times, this may be taken for granted. But when the economy slows down, that 
consistency stands out. 
In this special presentation, we're looking at seven companies with significant pricing power at all times, particularly 
with inflation currently running at 40-year highs.

Wizz Air is in a more difficult position than its peers after deciding to unwind fuel hedges in 2020, only to be caught 
out by a subsequent surge in pricing - jet fuel costs rose by 61 per cent last year and are up 55 per cent so far this 
year.
The airline announced a return to hedging in June and said last week that it had hedged 46 per cent of its 
requirements for the nine months to March 31.
Its share price has already taken a hit, though - down 45 per cent this year, compared with declines of 28 per cent 
at easyJet, 18 per cent at Ryanair and 14 per cent at Jet2.
Indeed, Wizz's market cap of £2.36bn, is only about £300mn more than Jet2's, despite having a fleet that is 50 per 
cent larger.
Wizz chair William Franke seems to believe that the sell-off has been overdone. He bought £1.9mn worth of shares 
on July 22.

 In the past week, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] posted upbeat traffic data for the month of July, driven by the 
buoyant air-travel demand scenario. Latin-American carrier, Gol Linhas GOL[2] also reported July traffic numbers. 
Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) declined at Gol with capacity growth outpacing traffic increase. 
Another Latin American carrier Copa Holdings CPA[3] reported better-than-expected earnings per share for 
second-quarter 2022 driven by higher revenues.With the earnings season in full swing, second-quarter results of 
many airline companies were reported in detail in the previous week's write up[4]. Recap of the Latest Top Stories 1 
In July, RYAAY flew 16.8 million passengers, the highest ever traffic volume at RYAAY in the said month. Last July, 
only 9.3 million passengers were transported by RYAAY. Load factor increased to 96% from 80% in July 2021. The 
number of passengers attracted by RYAAY in July 2022 was 14.2% higher than the 14.8 million passengers flown 
in July 2019 (pre-coronavirus era). July performance was recorded despite some of Ryanair's cabin crew staff in 
certain European countries being on strike. RYAAY operated more than 92,000 flights in July[5]. The stock currently 
carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6]. 
2. In July, Gol Linhas' consolidated traffic increased 36.3% year over year. To match the increased demand 
situation, GOL is expanding its capacity. In the same month, capacity grew 42.6% year over year. Since traffic 
growth was less than capacity expansion, load factor declined 3.7 percentage points (p.p) to 80.8% last month. 
Upbeat traffic in its domestic markets is leading to arosyscenario on a consolidated basis. In July, domestic traffic 
and capacity improved 24.1% and 31%, respectively. On the domestic front, 29.9% more passengers boarded 
GOL's flights in July 2022. 
3. Copa Holdings reported second-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding $2.69 from non-recurring items) of 32 cents 
per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents. In the year-ago quarter, CPA had incurred 
a loss of 38 cents per share due to coronavirus-led depressed air-travel demand. Quarterly revenues of $693.4 
million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $674.5 million and rose significantly year over year , courtesy 
ofimproved air-travel demand. 
Below, we present all comparisons (in % terms) with second-quarter 2019 levels (pre-coronavirus). 
Airline Stock Roundup: RYAAY 's Solid July Traffic, CPA's Q2 Earnings Beat & More
Passenger revenues (contributed 94.7% to the top line) increased 5.9% owing to higher yields (up 10.1%). Cargo 
and mail revenues jumped 62.4% to $26.7 million, owing to higher cargo volumes and yields. Total revenues 
improved 20% in the reported quarter. On a consolidated basis, traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles or 
RPMs) fell 3.8%. As traffic decline was more than the amount of capacity contraction (3.4%), load factor contracted 
0.4 percentage points to 84.8% in the reported quarter. Passenger revenue per available seat miles increased 9.6% 
to 11 cents. Additionally, revenue per available seat mile (RASM) increased 11. 3% to 11.6 cents. Cost per 
available seat mile (CASM) increased 19.9%. Excluding fuel, the metric dipped 4.6%. Average fuel price per liter 
soared 86.1% to $4.14. 
Total operating expenses increased 15.8% to $651.1 million due to the 67% increase in fuel costs. Expenses on 
wages, salaries and other employee benefits fell 17.9% on reduced headcount. Sales and distribution costs 
increased 9.6% due to higher sales. Passenger servicing costs dropped 37%. Flight operation costs decreased 
5.4%. 
Copa Holdings exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $134.1 million compared with $211.08 
million at the end of December 2021. Total debt, including lease liabilities, was $1.6 billion at the end of the second 
quarter.CPA exited the second quarter with a consolidated fleet of 94 aircraft comprising68 Boeing 737-800s, 17 
Boeing 737 MAX 9s,and nine Boeing 737-700s. During the second quarter, the carrier took delivery of one Boeing 
737 MAX 9 aircraft. 
Due to escalating fuel prices, among other factors, Copa Holdings expects third-quarter operating margin in the 16-
18% range. CPA expects capacity to be 6.4 billion, equivalent to 100% of the third-quarter 2019 capacity. Load 
factor is estimated to be around 86% in the September quarter. Fuel price is estimated to be $3.80 per gallon. 
For the full year, CPA expects capacity to reach approximately 98% of the 2019 level.CASM, excluding fuel, is 
anticipated to be 5.9 cents in 2022. 
4. Allegiant Travel ALGT[7] reported second-quarter 2022 loss (excluding 38 cents from non-recurring items) of 62 
cents per share, which matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Operating revenues of $629.8 million beat the 
Zacks Consensus Estimate of $629.2 million and increased 33.2% on a year-over-year basis. 
Passenger revenues, which accounted for the bulk (94.1%) of the top line, soared 33.5% on a year-over-year basis. 
The upside can be attributed to improvement in air-travel demand. Air traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles 
or RPMs) for scheduled service surged 33.9% in the quarter under review. Capacity (measured in available seat 
miles or ASMs) also increased 8.5% year over year. Load factor increased 1650 basis points to 87.3% in the 
reported quarter, as traffic surge outweighed capacity expansion.  
Operating cost per available seat miles (CASM), excluding fuel, escalated 42.2% year over year to 6.94 cents. 
Average fuel cost per gallon (scheduled) shot up in excess of 100% to $4.33 in the quarter. Total scheduled service 
passenger revenue per available seat miles rose 22.5% to 12.69 cents. ALGT exited the June quarter with 115 
planes in its fleet. Fleet size at the end of 2022 is expected to be 124. 
For third-quarter 2022, fuel cost per gallon is expected to be $3.80. Total operating revenues are likely to increase 
29% from third-quarter 2019 actuals. Non-fuel unit costs are likely to increase approximately 10%. Capacity for 
scheduled service and total system are likely to increase 18% and 16%, respectively, from third-quarter 2019 
actuals. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week 
and during the last six months.

ARCA Airline Index has increased 4.5% to $62.76. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index has plummeted 23.9%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Second-quarter earnings report of Latin American 
carrier Azul AZUL[8] is scheduled to be released on Aug 11. Our proven model does not predict an earnings beat 
for AZUL this time around.

Aug 04, 2022( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Shares of Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] had a good run on the bourses on Aug 3, gaining 2.9% from Aug 2's 
closing. As a result of this uptick, the stock closed yesterday's trading at $73.60. Why the Uptick? The highly 
impressive July traffic numbers led to the stock price gain on Aug 3. The carrier flew 16.8 million passengers in the 
month, the highest ever traffic volume at RYAAY in the said month. Last July, only 9.3 million passengers were 
transported by RYAAY. 
Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) increased to 96% from 80% in July 2021. The number of passengers 
attracted by RYAAY in July 2022 was 14.2% higher than the 14.8 million passengers flown in July 2019 (pre-
coronavirus era). July performance was recorded despite some of Ryanair's cabin crew staff in certain European 
countries being on strike. RYAAY operated more than 92,000 flights in July. 
Ryanair has been benefiting from improved traffic owing to upbeat air-travel demand for quite some time as COVID-
19 restrictions are relaxed. In first-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Jun 30, 2022), RYAAY's revenues surged 602% year 
over year to €2.6 billion on the back of buoyant traffic. Scheduled revenues in the fiscal first quarter increased 720% 
to €1.58 billion. 
The number of passengers who flew on RYAAY planes were 45.5 million in the quarter, up 461% year over year. 
The traffic was 9% more than the pre-COVID levels. Load factor in first-quarter fiscal 2023 was 92% compared with 
73% a year ago. Zacks Rank Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the 
broader Zacks Transportation [2]sector are Star Bulk Carriers SBLK[3] and C.H. Robinson Worldwide CHRW[4] , 
each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks 
here.[5] 
Star Bulk's earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters and 
missed once, the average surprise being 7.1%. 
Shares of Star Bulk have gained more than 27% in a year's time. Improvement in economic activities is aiding the 
SBLK stock. 
C.H. Robinson has an expected earnings growth rate of 15.9% for the current year. CHRW delivered a trailing four-
quarter earnings surprise of 24.2%, on average. 
C.H. Robinson has a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. Shares of CHRW have gained 21% over the past 
year.

(Alliance News) -  Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday recorded sharp traffic growth in July, flying 2 million more 
passengers than it did the same month before the Covid-10 pandemic.
The Dublin-based budget airline said passenger numbers surged by 81% to 16.8 million last month from 9.3 million 
a year earlier. Ryanair's July passenger numbers were its best so far this year, eclipsing June's 15.9 million. The 
latest figure also topped July 2019's pre-pandemic total of 14.8 million.
Ryanair said it operated 92,300 flights in July.
Rolling annual passenger numbers to July more than tripled to 142.0 million, from 40.0 million a year before.
Load factor last month was 96%, up slightly from 95% in June and greatly improved from 80% a year ago. On a 
rolling 12-month basis, load factor was 87%, up from 74% a year before.
The figures come as airports in the UK and Europe have suffered from long passenger queues, flight cancellations 
and delays, and lost luggage. Carriers, which cut jobs in the wake of the Covid pandemic, have struggled to cope 
with the quick pick-up in demand as restrictions were eased.
Shares in Ryanair were up 1.5% to EUR12.56 each in Dublin on Wednesday around midday.

IN 2020 we ran out of toilet paper and pasta. In 2021, it was semiconductor chips and migrants to pick our fruit. 
Now, in 2022, we've run out of short haul British Airways flights. The national carrier won't sell any new tickets from 
Heathrow until mid-August as a result of the airports decision to cap the number of passengers at 100,000. It could 
extend into the bank holiday weekend or longer. Only last week, leading voices in business and politics were busy 
waxing lyrical on the 10 year anniversary of the London Olympics, extolling the virtues of sporting events to bring 
tourism dollars into the capital.
Imagine if they were being hosted next week: the stadium would have been a shadow of itself with ticket-holders 
still stuck on the tarmac.
According to London & Partners, if we play our cards right we could have 40m visitors a year, injecting £22bn into 
the city's economy by 2025.
But they won't be doing that at this rate, with ticket prices spiralling and other airports in the country likely to be 
even more rammed as a result of Heathrow's failure to prepare for an upswing in travel. The fault of the travel crisis 
cannot be easily apportioned. The airports and the airlines must both shoulder their share of the blame.
It would be only extreme naivety to not see BA's decision as a toss of the dice in a negotiation with Heathrow to 
scrap - or at least hike - the passenger cap.
John Holland-Kaye, the Heathrow chief executive, has blamed airlines.
Time to knock heads together until planes can fly at full capacity THE CITY VIEW
Airline execs such as Ryanair's chief financial officer have thrown it back at the airports. Doling out blame will serve 
us only as far as it elucidates the problem and the problem is one of people: we do not have enough staff to ensure 
easy travel.
Instead of waging a war of words, we ought to launch a campaign to hire until all stations are manned, flights are 
taking off and bags aren't being lost somewhere out near Hounslow.

Ryanair's passenger count grew by 16.8 million this July, making for an 81% increase compared to 2021 numbers, 
data published on Wednesday August 3 shows.
The Irish budger airline operated approximately 92,300 flights in the month, with load factor coming in at 96%.
Load factor is an efficiency rating that measures the percentage of available seating capacity filled by passengers.
Rolling annual passenger count was hit by the Omicron variant between December and February, although at 142 
million was still a 255% year-on-year improvement.
NASDAQ-listed RYAAY shares were up 0.5% in Tuesday's after-hours trade.
The competition
Hungarian budget rival Wizz Air also saw strong July results, having increased passenger count by 61%, although 
rolling annual numbers were a less impressive 128% increase.
Meanwhile, easyJet continues to grapple with large-scale flight cancellations and strikes among its Spanish pilots, 
which may be leading customers to shop around elsewhere.

Top European Airlines Have Spent 4bn on Russian Jet Fuel Since Crimea Invasion

 Ukrainian activists have criticised aviation companies for buying billions of pounds worth of jet fuel from Russia 
since Vladimir Putin's 2014 annexation of Crimea. 
Last year, British Airways owner IAG spent an estimated 13.4 million on Russian-sourced kerosene, according to a 
new analysis[1] of Europe's ten largest airline companies. 
IAG - which also owns Spanish and Irish carriers Iberia and Aer Lingus - used 586 barrels of Russian jet fuel per 
day in 2021, spending the equivalent of 36,903 per day. 
The sum was nearly double the next biggest spender, Scandinavian airline SAS, which spent an estimated 7.1 
million, according to calculations by data specialists Zero Carbon Analytics.. 
In total, the ten airline companies spent an estimated 4.1 billion on Russian jet fuel since Putin's 2014 annexation of 
Crimea. This includes 850 million in 2019 alone, before sales dropped during the Covid pandemic. 
Russia's escalation of its war on Ukraine in February has contributed to a spike in energy prices and sparked efforts 
to move away from Russian fossil fuels across Europe. 
The analysis does not cover purchasing in 2022. No airline companies responded when asked by DeSmog whether 
they still source from Russia. 
Svitlana Romanko, coordinator of Stand With Ukraine[2], which campaigns against Russian fossil fuel imports to 
Europe, said: 'The research has made clear that as of the end of 2021, British Airways, Scandinavian Airlines and 
other air flight providers were still buying aviation fuel from Russia.' 
She called on airlines to disclose where they are currently sourcing their jet fuel, adding: 'No one should buy 
Russian oil, gas and coal and feed Putin's war machine, otherwise the whole world will face a bleak, dictatorial 
future devoid of freedom, security and choice.' 
Ukrainian Boycott Call 
The UK has pledged[3] to stop all imports of Russian oil by the end of 2022, while the EU - where countries are 
typically more reliant on Russian energy - have agreed[4] to ban 90 percent of oil from Russia by the same 
deadline. 
There are concerns, however, that Russian oil refined in other countries, such as India, could continue to make its 
way to Europe. 
Top European Airlines Have Spent 4bn on Russian Jet Fuel Since Crimea Invasion
In March 2022, soon after the Russian invasion, Oleg Ustenko, an advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr 
Zelensky, called[5] on Europeans to boycott airlines that use Russian jet fuel. 
To calculate the estimates, Zero Carbon Analytics used official national statistics on European demand for Russian 
jet fuel, average prices for each year, and the number of barrels used by each airline. 
Others in the top five for 2021 were Hungarian airline Wizz Air with 3.9 million, Swiss airline EasyJet with 3.8 
million, and Ireland's Ryanair with 3.4 million. 
In the years since the annexation of Crimea, European airlines have increased how much they spend on Russian 
jet fuel, according to the research, from 375.5 million in 2014 to nearly 850 million in 2019, the last year before the 
Covid pandemic hit the aviation industry. 
British supermarkets have also been criticised[6] for continuing to sell Russian-sourced diesel at their petrol stations 
ahead of the government-imposed deadline of the end of this year. 
UK Airports Top List 
Zero Carbon Analytics also found that London's Heathrow Airport was the biggest site of Russian jet fuel 
consumption out of any European airport in 2021, using 874 barrels per day at a cost of nearly 55,000. London's 
Gatwick Airport came fourth with 126 barrels per day. 
Between 2011 and 2021, Heathrow and Gatwick were by far the largest consumers of Russian jet fuel, accounting 
for 92 percent of European use of Russian jet fuel on average across that period, the analysis found. 
Gatwick told DeSmog that the airport doesn't use or run the fuel supply, which is managed by a consortium of fuel 
providers called GASCo - Gatwick Airport Storage Company. 
A Heathrow spokesperson said: 'We do not purchase jet fuel. Airlines source their own fuel for their aircraft. At 
Heathrow there are a number of different suppliers who provide this service to airlines.'

 Bucharest Aurel Vlaicu International Airport (Baneasa) reopened on Monday, August 1, on the occasion of the 
110th anniversary of its inauguration, manager of Bucharest Airports Company, George Dorobantu said. 
The airport has gone through a program of modernization of airport buildings and equipment in recent years. Three 
airline companies are already ready to start scheduled and charter flights on Baneasa. 'We already have three 
advanced discussions at the stage of signing contracts to operate from Baneasa. It is about Ryanair which is 
looking for solutions to increase its aircraft base in Romania, they will operate two flights from the autumn or winter 
season, Air Connect which announced its intention to operate also from Baneasa, currently they are authorized for 
Otopeni but will also operate at Baneasa, for flights with short distance ATR aircraft. There is another company 
registered in the Republic of Moldova, Fly One for charter flights, Baneasa-Chisinau,' said Dorobantu, who resigned 
from the position of manager of Bucharest Airports Company. Unlike Otopeni Airport where passengers must arrive 
at least two hours before boarding, at Baneasa the time will be less than an hour. Also on Monday, August 1, 2022, 
an event is scheduled to celebrate the 110th anniversary of the establishment of B?neasa Airport, considered the 
third oldest airport in the world still in operation. Baneasa Airport was inaugurated in 1920, but its history begins on 
August 1, 1912, when the Romanian Air League, led by Prince George Valentin Bibescu, established a piloting 
school for military pilots in Baneasa.

Belavia only beneficiary as Russia ungrounds 737 MAX
Belavia only beneficiary as Russia ungrounds 737 MAX

The Russian Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsia) has authorised the B737 MAX to operate in its airspace. 
However, as the move is limited to friendly countries only, Belarus's Belavia (B2, Minsk National) is the only 
beneficiary of the decision.
Unusually, Russia did not issue its own statement about the type's ungrounding. Instead, the news was shared by 
the Belarus Ministry of Transport and Communications and was subsequently confirmed by the Russian state-
owned news agency TASS.
Belavia's sole B737-8, EW-528PA (msn 43344), crossed Russian airspace for the first time on July 21, 2022, 
operating from Minsk National to Kutaisi in Georgia, Flightradar24 ADS-B data shows. It has since been regularly 
deployed on a variety of eastbound routes from Minsk, including to the Caucasus, Central Asia, and Russia itself. 
The aircraft was delivered to Belavia in April 2021, when most countries in the world (including Belarus) had already 
ungrounded the type. It was briefly deployed on services to Tel Aviv Ben Gurion, Larnaca, Kyiv Boryspil, and 
Warsaw Chopin between July 19 and July 27, 2021, all of which bypass Russia. It was subsequently grounded as 
Belavia was banned from the EU after the state-orchestrated hijacking of a Ryanair B737-800. For the next year, 
EW-528PA was parked in Minsk operating only test flights within Belarus. The carrier owns the aircraft, having 
bought it from Air Lease Corporation.
For its part, S7 Airlines (S7, Novosibirsk) would have been the only Russian MAX operator with two MAX 8s in its 
fleet, leased from each of Air Lease Corporation and Aviation Capital Group. The privately-owned carrier is 
reportedly seeking to return the aircraft to their lessors to comply with the termination of the leases due to sanctions 
on Russia but first needs to secure the Kremlin's approval.
All European Union carriers and airlines from countries opposing Russia's invasion of Ukraine are banned from 
Russian airspace.

A new dedicated cargo carrier - IPP Air Cargo - is launching in Vietnam.
The start-up will be supported by Incline Aviation and BBAM, which will supply its launch aircraft, Airfinance Journal 
understands.
First up will be a 2004-vintage Boeing 737-800 converted freighter that was acquired by Incline from Ryanair in 
2021.
That aircraft is due in the coming weeks.
Three additional 737-800 freighters are scheduled for delivery in the coming months.
IPP Air Cargo was first registered in 2021 with an initial capital of VND2.4 trillion ($103 million).
The airline plans to launch international cargo services from Vietnamese gateways Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City to 
regional hubs including Hong Kong and Singapore, as well as domestic services within Vietnam.
IPP Air Cargo is led by chief executive Le Hong Thuy Tien, with former Polar Air Cargo chief operating officer Lars 
Winkelbauer acting as a consultant.
The start-up is yet to receive its air operator's certificate. A first application last year was rejected by Vietnamese 
authorities, citing the pandemic.
IPP Air Cargo wants to launch revenue services in September.
Earlier this week Airfinance Journal reported that BBAM would supply a maiden Airbus A321P2F lease for Omani 
carrier Salam Air following conversion in China.

The struggle between Ryanair's unions and management has only just begun.
After June and July were marked by strikes at airports, two Ryanair cabin crew unions, Unión Sindical Obrera 
(USO) and Sitcpla, have called for a walk out that will last five months running from 8 August to 7 January 2023.
The industrial action will take place every week, from Monday to Thursday, and will last 24 hours, sources from 
USO told Euronews. Their demands include a call for the immediate reinstatement of the 11 workers fired for 
striking this July.
"We are seeing a trickle of dismissals almost daily. Last week it was the tenth worker and yesterday another 
colleague from Barcelona who had been with the company for 12 years," union sources say.
They are also calling for an end to disciplinary proceedings against almost 100 workers who took part in the 
stoppages.
"They are using this as a way of intimidating the workforce. It is their way of warning workers to be careful about 
going on strike," says a union spokeswoman.
Despite the situation, the company refuses to sit down with the unions.
"There has not yet been any kind of cooperation on their part," the USO says.
The 18 days of strikes since the beginning of the summer caused an estimated 310 cancellations and about 
3,455 delays at 10 Ryanair bases in Spain.
"Even with all the obstacles, there has been between 35 per cent and 40 per cent of the strike follow up".
This new action will mainly affect the airports of Madrid-Barajas, Barcelona, Malaga, Alicante, Seville and Palma de 
Mallorca. Both national and international connections will be disrupted.
What are the union's demands?
Flights to and from Spain affected by Ryanair 5-month walkout starting in August
The workers' demands include "the application of basic labour rights", in the words of the union.
A few months ago, Ryanair left negotiations with USO and Sitcpla to come to an agreement with CC OO, another of 
the unions. Only workers affiliated with CC OO will be able to benefit from the conditions of the agreement, 
something that USO doesn't think is acceptable. This is what led to the strike.
What they are asking for is the application of Spanish labour legislation on rest breaks and the implementation of 
the 14 public holidays that Spanish workers have - instead of the nine that the company offers.
They are also calling for the end of subcontracting through employment agencies such as Workforce and Crewlink 
under Irish legislation.
In addition, they are demanding a wage increase to return their pay to pre-pandemic levels. COVID brought 
a substantial pay cut for the workforce due to the standstill experienced by all airlines and the unions point out that 
employees' pay has not recovered.
They also claim that they are only paid for hours flown. The unions are asking for their base salary to be at least the 
minimum interprofessional wage.
What does Ryanair have to say?
In a statement Ryanair said, "Ryanair has recently reached an agreement with the main Spanish CCOO union on 
pay, rosters and allowances for its Spanish cabin crew.
Recent strikes by USO/SITCPLA have been poorly supported with minimal effect. Ryanair has operated over 
45,000 flights to/from Spain over the last 3 months with less than 1% affected by crewing and Ryanair expects 
minimal (if any) disruption this winter."
Yesterday there were nine flight cancellations and 42 delays. Barcelona-El Prat airport has been the most affected, 
followed by Madrid and Malaga

Ryanair is delighted to mark 12 months of the Boeing 737-8200 "Gamechanger" in Milan Bergamo, reaffirming its 
strong commitment to environmental sustainability and leading the sustainable aviation agenda in European 
aviation. This latest generation aircraft has saved Ryanair over 6,000 tonnes of fuel with a total CO2 savings of c. 
20,000 tonnes from Bergamo in the past year. Ryanair's 20 Bergamo based aircraft, 10 of which will be our most 
enviro efficient "Gamechanger" aircraft (4% more seats, burn 16% less fuel and create 40% less noise emissions), 
represent an investment of over $2bn, delivering over 100 routes including 9 new Summer routes, supporting 600 
highly paid aviation jobs and over 9,5k indirect jobs at Bergamo Airport. Ryanair expect to transport 12.2m 
passengers to/from Bergamo for the fiscal year 2023 (1.6m more than pre pandemic period) to give Bergamo's 
holiday makers an abundance of choice to top European destinations whilst also giving Lombardy's tourism a 
much-needed boost after two challenging years.

Canceled flights. Long lines. Staff walkouts. Missing luggage.
Sound familiar? The chaos engulfing many major airports in North America and Europe since summer hasn't 
abated much, and news outlets and social media users continue to report on hordes of impatient travelers and 
mountains of misplaced suitcases.
Just this week, German carrier Lufthansa canceled nearly all its flights in Frankfurt and Munich, stranding some 
130,000 travelers due to a one-day walkout by its ground staff who were on strike for better pay.
London's Heathrow Airport and Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport - two of the largest travel hubs in Europe -slashed 
their passenger capacity and demanded that airlines cut flights in and out of their airports, which angered both 
travelers and airline managers.
Carriers in the U.S. have also canceled and delayed tens of thousands of flights due to staffing shortages and 
weather issues.
Airlines are vocally laying the blame on airports and governments. On Monday, the chief financial officer of low-cost 
European carrier Ryanair, Neil Sorahan, complained that airports "had one job to do."
But many of those working in the industry say airlines are partly responsible for staff shortages as well, and the 
situation is becoming dire enough that it could threaten safety.
CNBC spoke to several pilots flying for major airlines, all of whom described fatigue due to long hours and what 
they said was opportunism and a desire to cut costs as part of a toxic "race to the bottom" culture pervading the 
industry and worsening the messy situation that travelers are facing today.
All the airline staff spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to speak to the press.
'Absolute carnage'
"From a passenger point of view, it's an absolute nightmare," a pilot for European low-cost carrier easyJet told 
CNBC.
Pilots open up on why air travel is in chaos
"Leading into the summer, it was absolute carnage because airlines didn't know what they were doing. They didn't 
have a proper plan in place. All they knew they wanted to do was try and fly as much as humanly possible - almost 
as if the pandemic had never happened," the pilot said.
"But they forgot that they'd cut all of their resources."
The ensuing imbalance has "made our life an absolute mess, both cabin crew and pilots," the pilot added, 
explaining how a shortage of ground staff since the Covid pandemic layoffs - those who handle baggage, check-in, 
security and more - has created a domino effect that's throwing a wrench into flying schedules.
In a statement, easyJet said that the health and well-being of employees is "our highest priority," stressing that "we 
take our responsibilities as an employer very seriously and employ our people on local contracts on competitive 
terms and in line with local legislation."
The industry is now hobbled by a combination of factors: not having enough resources for retraining, former staff 
not wanting to return, and poor pay that has largely remained suppressed since pandemic-era cuts, despite 
significantly improved revenue for airlines.
"They've told us pilots we are on pay cuts until at least 2030 - except all the managers are back on full pay plus pay 
rises for inflation," a pilot for British Airways said.
"Various governments with their restrictions and no support for the aviation sector" as well as airport companies are 
in large part to blame for the current chaos, the pilot said, adding that "some airlines took advantage of the situation 
to cut salaries, make new contracts and lay people off, and now that things are back to normal they can't cope."
While many airports and airlines are now recruiting and offering better pay, the required training programs and 
security clearance processors are also severely cut back and overwhelmed, further hobbling the sector.
'They are shocked, which is incredible'
British Airways ground staff were set to strike in August over the fact that their full pay had still not been reinstated - 
something especially stinging at a time when the CEO of BA's parent company, IAG, was given a £250,000 
($303,000) gross living allowance for the year.
But this week, the airline and workers' union agreed on a salary increase to call off the planned strike, though some 
staff say it's still not a full return to their pre-pandemic pay.
In a statement, British Airways said: "The last two years have been devastating for the entire aviation industry. We 
took action to restructure our business to survive and to save jobs."
The company also said, "the vast majority of redundancies during this time period were voluntary."
"We're completely focused on building resilience into our operation to give customers the certainty they deserve," 
the airline said.
IAG CEO Luis Gallego, whose company owns BA, forfeited his £900,000 bonus in 2021 and took voluntary salary 
reductions in 2020 and 2021, and did not receive his 2020 bonus.
One pilot flying for Dubai's flagship Emirates Airline said that a short-term mindset that took employees for granted 
had for years been laying the groundwork for today's situation.
The airlines "were happy to try and depress wages for lots of people in the industry for years, on the assumption 
that nobody had anywhere else to go," the pilot said. "And now that people are exercising their right to go 
somewhere else, they are shocked, which is incredible. I'm shocked that they're shocked."
A safety risk?
Pilots open up on why air travel is in chaos
All this stress for airline staff comes on top of the often ignored issue of pilot fatigue, all the pilots interviewed by 
CNBC said.
The legal maximum limit for a pilot's flying time is 900 hours per year. But for many airlines, "that wasn't seen as the 
absolute maximum, it was seen as the target to try and make everybody's workload as efficient as possible," the 
easyJet pilot said.
"That's the big worry with us is that we've got a fairly toxic culture, an inordinate amount of work," the Emirates pilot 
echoed. "That all adds up to potentially reducing the safety margin. And that's a big concern."
All this has been combined with low pay and less attractive contracts, the pilots say, many of which were rewritten 
when the pandemic turned air travel on its head.
"A bit of a toxic soup of all of those, the airports and the airlines share an equal level of blame. It's been a race to 
the bottom for years," the Emirates pilot said. "They're only going to ever try and pay as little as they can get away 
with paying."
A spokesperson for Emirates Airline said: "We'd never compromise on safety at Emirates, and there are strict 
regulatory requirements for rest and flying hours which we adhere to for our operating crew. Our safety record, in 
the air and on ground, is one of the best in the industry."
They added, "We continue to recruit and retain our flying crew with competitive packages, career progression, and 
other generous benefits."
'Race to the bottom'
"Crony capitalists. Rat race to the bottom. No respect for skilled workforce now," the BA pilot said of the industry's 
corporate leadership. "They just want the cheapest labor to produce their own big bonuses and keep shareholders 
happy."
The International Air Transport Association said in response to these criticisms that "the airline industry is ramping 
up resources as quickly as possible to safely and efficiently meet the needs of travelers." It acknowledged that 
"there is no doubt that these are tough times for the industry's workers, particularly where they are in short supply."
The trade group has issued recommendations "to attract and retain talent in the ground handling sector," and said 
in a statement that "securing additional resources where deficiencies exist is among the top priorities of industry 
management teams around the world."
"And in the meantime," it added, "the patience of travelers."

EasyJet cabin crew in Spain reach pay deal, end strike
EasyJet cabin crew in Spain reach pay deal, end strike

The Spanish-based cabin crew of low-cost carrier EasyJet cancelled their strike planned for the weekend after 
reaching a pay agreement with management.
The work stoppages scheduled for Friday through Sunday have been called off, the Spanish union USO announced 
on Thursday.
It said the British airline had promised a 22% pay increase spread over the next three years. The USO called this a 
"significant" improvement, although not as high as the 40% it had hoped to achieve.
More than 300 of the some 400 flight attendants working for EasyJet in Spain had voted on the agreement and 
approved it by nearly 75%, the union said.
Cabin crews stationed in Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca and Málaga had gone on strike for more money between 
July 1 and 3 and between July 15 and 17. In total, the employees planned to strike for nine days in July.
The basic salary of EasyJet flight attendants in Spain is currently (EURO)950 ($967 dollars) a month, according to 
USO. That is (EURO)850 less than in Germany or France, it said.
"With the basic salary, we can hardly pay the rent or the mortgage," the representative of the airline employees at 
USO, Miguel Galán, had said.
A day earlier Ryanair cabin crew, who have been on strike for better working conditions and pay in Spain since the 
end of June, announced a five-month extension of their walkout.
Between August 8 and January 7, 2023, they will strike every week from Monday to Thursday, the USO and Sitcpla 
unions announced.
EasyJet cabin crew in Spain reach pay deal, end strike
So far, because of the requirement by Spanish law for airlines to maintain "minimum services" during strikes, only a 
relatively small proportion of flights has actually been cancelled.

(Alliance News) - easyJet PLC flight crews ended a strike on Thursday after reaching a deal with management that 
raises wages by over a fifth, the USO trade union said.
The union launched at the beginning of the month a series of nine strike days at the Barcelona, Malaga and 
Majorca airports to obtain raises and better working conditions.
The strikes forced the low-cost British airline to cancel and delay flights at the beginning of the peak European 
summer vacation season.
USO said that a staff assembly had approved the deal, which will see flight crews get a 22% pay hike spread over 
three years, as well as special compensation for working on scheduled days off.
Remaining strike days planned for July 29, 30 and 31 have been cancelled.
Irish budget airline Ryanair has also been hit by strikes in Spain.
Strikes by airline and airport staff across Europe have led to misery for travellers as the aviation industry was 
hoping a bumper summer season would help make up two dismal years due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The industry had slashed jobs due to the pandemic and had difficulty rehiring staff to handle the boom in travellers, 
while staff complain that wages and working conditions need to improve.

Heathrow airport boss blames women packing too much make-up as reason for queues
Heathrow airport boss blames women packing too much make-up as reason 
for queues

Horror delays at Heathrow are being partly caused by passengers taking too much make-up and feigning mobility 
issues, the airport's boss has claimed.
In recent months, Heathrow passengers have faced winding queues, last-minute cancellations, and mountains of 
lost baggage.
To stem the chaos, the airport recently introduced a daily cap of 100,000 visitors and asked airlines to stop selling 
new tickets for August flights.
However, Heathrow Chief Executive John Holland-Kaye today insisted that the summer getaway has "started well."
Speaking on 'Leading Britain's Conversation' radio station, he claimed that airport security numbers matched pre-
pandemic levels - but that passengers are "travelling with more than they usually would.""They have got more bags, 
and more liquids in their bags so that takes a little bit longer," he said.
"A lot of people are put off from checking in all of their make-up for example because they are worried about 
whether their bag will make the journey with them.
"People tend not to think of makeup as being prohibited from travel, so there's a lot of education that we need to do 
with people."
Since it tends to be women carrying make-up, it is assumed his comments are directed at female travellers.
What's really going on at Heathrow airport?
Heathrow's flight cap - imposed in order to "protect holidays" - was slammed by airports like Emirates, which initially 
refused to comply.
On Monday, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary accused the airport of being unable to run "a p***-up in its own 
brewery."
However, the airport has hit back, blaming airlines for failing to hire enough ground staff.
Heathrow airport boss blames women packing too much make-up as reason for queues
"Ground handlers are the backbone of what you think of as being the airport, but they are employed by the airlines," 
Mr Holland Kaye said.
"They did a very good job through until the beginning of June [2022], but the demand was just getting too much for 
them so we had to take action."
On Monday, Heathrow announced that more than 750 unpaid volunteers would give away 10,000 hours and 2,200 
shifts this summer to help passengers through the airport.
Are airports failing people with mobility issues?
All this chaos impacts some people worse than others.
According to the Civil Aviation Authority, people with disabilities disproportionately bear the brunt of UK airport 
service failings.
"It is self-evident that those with less mobility will find it more difficult to access support at airports when things go 
wrong," the CAA warned in June.
In the same month, a man fell to his death at Gatwick after being left waiting for a helper and disembarking a plane 
alone.
Today, Mr Holland-Kaye defended Heathrow's track record of assisting customers with mobility issues - blaming a 
"social media hack" for an uptick in demand.
Asked about an incident where 20 wheelchair passengers were allegedly left waiting in a non-air conditioned part of 
the terminal, he claimed that some passengers were attempting to skip the queue by feigning mobility issues.
"Some of this is because people are using the wheelchair support to try to get fast-tracked through the airport, that 
is absolutely the wrong thing to be doing, we need to protect that for the people who most need help," he said.
"If you go on TikTok you will see that is one of the travel hacks that people are recommending."

Ryanair cabin crew extend strikes in Spain for five months
Ryanair cabin crew extend strikes in Spain for five months

Cabin crew at the low-cost airline Ryanair, who have been on strike for better working conditions in Spain since the 
end of June, are extending their walkouts for another five months.
The Spanish unions USO and Sitcpla announced on Wednesday that they would strike every week from Monday to 
Thursday between August 8 and January 7, 2023.
The four-day-a-week strike was instituted as the Irish airline is not complying with Spanish law and is also refusing 
to negotiate, they said.
They are demanding compliance with "basic labour rights" such as 22 working days of annual leave, 14 statutory 
public holidays, implementation of the Health and Safety at Work Act and a pay rise to pre-pandemic levels.
Ryanair cabin crew have already called a total of 18 strike days since June 24 and up to Thursday, but so far these 
have not led to a resolution of the industrial dispute.
These work stoppages have led to the cancellation of a total of about 300 flights and about 3,000 delays, the state 
television station RTVE reported on Wednesday.
Numerous airports are affected by the Ryanair strikes: Málaga, Seville, Alicante, Valencia, Girona, Ibiza and 
Santiago de Compostela, in addition to Madrid, Barcelona and Mallorca.
However, because of the requirement by Spanish law for airlines to maintain "minimum services" during strikes, 
only a - often relatively small - proportion of flights has actually been cancelled.
In the case of the Ryanair strikes, for example, the Transport Ministry recently decided that at least 73% to 82% of 
all scheduled flights must be completed on the strike days, depending on the airport, meaning the impact on 
travellers has been limited.

HEATHROW's chief executive yesterday lambasted Ryanair after the airline accused airports of not recruiting 
enough ground handling staff ahead of the peak season.
Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye deemed the comments made on Monday by Ryanair's chief financial 
officer Neil Sorahan "ridiculous".
In its half-year report, Heathrow airport said it had been raising concerns over low handler numbers for nine 
months, after airlines slashed staff levels amid Covid-19 lockdowns.
Airport and airline bosses have clashed in recent weeks over travel chaos during the peak summer season.

tumultuous summer, albeit quite differently.
Unilever's interim results will provide the market with good insight into how consumer brands are coping amidst the 
cost-of-living crisis with price competition squeezing margins.
It has been something of a sideshow period for Unilever shareholders punctuated with activism (leading to US 
billionaire Nelson Peltz joining the board), speculation over possible M&A and spin outs, a political ice cream row in 
Israel, and, more broadly investor appetite for defensive dividend-paying blue-chip shares.
Amongst the odd cluster of events, Unilever's unpopular and quickly shot down tilt at Glaxo was a standout - and, 
according to CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson, the company can be thankful for the failure.
"Sometimes in life timing is everything and Unilever CEO Alan Jope dodged a bullet earlier this year when 
GlaxoSmithKline rejected his £50bn offer for the consumer health care business as he attempted to engineer a 
change in fortunes for the Unilever share price," the analyst said.
"Notwithstanding the fact it was a terrible idea, it was Jope's good fortune that Glaxo didn't snap his hand off. Most 
shareholders hated the idea, sending the shares to 5-year lows, and increasing the pressure on him further.
Unilever and easyJet in spotlight as this summer's blue-chip reporting cranks up a gear
"Over the last two years the spreads business has gone, as has the tea business, with management under 
pressure to do more to improve margins and profitability. A steep rise in costs has hit its operating margins, some of 
which has been mitigated by the company raising prices."
Jope is under pressure, Hewson said, and the consumer brands firm needs to move the story on - financial 
performance will help or hinder.
"Since the failure of the Glaxo bid the share price has recovered, back to the levels predating the bid, helped in 
some part by the appointment of activist investor Nelson Peltz to the board, who was instrumental in turning around 
Procter and Gamble," the analyst said.
"Nonetheless rising costs are expected to be a challenge going forward, something that shareholders were warned 
about in the first quarter, with the board warning that input cost inflation is likely to push up costs to around 
(EURO)2.7bn in the second half of the year, up from (EURO)2.1bn in the first half."
Easyjet
The orange budget airline follows Ryanair, which reported on Monday, and like the Irish firm traffic numbers are 
likely to be a key focus - along with 2022 outlook and a status check on the airline's financial health in what 
continues to be a turbulent trading environment.
Previously, easyJet delivered 87% of capacity in the third quarter of its fiscal year 2022, versus pre-Covid levels, up 
from 67% in the second quarter. 
The market consensus is that the budget airline will deliver £1.7bn of revenue for the quarter, a vast improvement 
on last year's equivalent turnover. 
"easyJet remains in a challenging position with weak operational performance, rising capex for fleet renewal, high 
fuel prices and a worsening economic outlook," Peel Hunt analyst Alexander Paterson said in a note.

Ryanair takes aim at 'one job' airport failings

RYANAIR's chief financial officer Neil Sohoran yesterday blamed airports for ongoing summer travel chaos, arguing 
they only had "one job to do".
"The airports themselves, they had one job to do and that was to make sure they have sufficient handlers and 
security staff," Sorahan told the BBC's Today programme yesterday.
"We managed to staff up for 73 additional aircrafts well in advance and it's incumbent on the airports to get their 
planning better next year."
The executive's comments come as the EU aviation industry continues to be swept by a wave of cancellations, 
delays and overall travel disruption.
The UK was hit particularly hard due to a combination of post-Covid pent-up demand and labour shortages. 
Heathrow,
Britain's largest airport, was forced to put a daily cap for departing passengers of 100,000 while BA slashed its peak 
season schedule by 18 per cent compared with April forecasts.
According to Sorahan, the main reason behind the travel mayhem was air traffic disruption across Europe.
"You have to hold air navigation service providers and various governments to account in relation to not staffing up 
appropriately for that," he said. Ryanair posted a £145m first quarter profit, its first since the pandemic struck, 
despite travel disruption and the blow dealt by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Passenger numbers also rebounded, hitting 45.5m, 9 per cent ahead of pre-pandemic levels. Nonetheless, the 
carrier declined to make predictions for the full year due to the "fragile" nature of the market.

MICHAEL O'Leary is not everybody's cup of Irish tea. But the Ryanair boss would be right to enjoy a celebratory 
cuppa aboard one of his flights (that'll be (EURO)2, fella) as his airline returns to profitability in a summer marked by 
chaotic scenes across Europe at his rivals' check-in desks.
The story of how is a relatively simple one. In short, Ryanair used a strong balance sheet ahead of the pandemic to 
keep staff on albeit at mutually agreed - or at least mostly mutually agreed - lower rates. The firm kept training staff, 
too. Elsewhere in the industry, faced with an absurd lack of sector-specific help, airports, air traffic control providers 
and other airlines instead cut staff to the bone. Lo and behold, as the aviation industry finds high altitude once 
again, Ryanair has been forced to cancel or delay fewer flights and, broadly, get people to the places they paid to 
go to on time (or at least, Ryanair time).
This is some achievement and it deserves credit.
O'Leary's no nonsense persona (even yesterday he couldn't resist a pop at "idiot Belgian unions") distracts at times 
from the lean, mean, efficient flying machine he has built.
It is a shame others in the industry haven't cracked the same trick. Many of the airlines which cut staff during the 
pandemic had in truth already been trying to bring costs into line with the models used by Ryanair and Easyjet, but 
did it - broadly - badly. There is a compelling argument that competing on price was never a good idea, because if 
you do that you're left with only one option: get cheaper. Legacy carriers simply couldn't do so, and O'Leary won 
every price war that came his way.
O'Leary deserves credit for flying Ryanair safely through storms 02 NEWS TUESDAY 26 JULY 2022 
www.CITYAM.COM STANDING UP FOR THE CITY THE CITY VIEW
Nobody particularly enjoys a Ryanair flight, but this summer at least you can mostly be sure it'll be there when you 
arrive at the airport.
Though the rest of the industry has not covered itself in glory, O'Leary et al can be content with a summer's job well 
done.

Ryanair swung back into profit in its first quarter but with continued uncertainty over the Ukraine war and Covid-19. 
Europe's biggest budget carrier warned "the days of (EURO)9.99 fares are probably coming to an end".
The Dublin-based airline posted profit before exceptional items of (EURO)170mn in the three months to June, from 
a loss of (EURO)273mn in the same period last year and well above the consensus market forecast of 
(EURO)157mn.
But that was still well below the (EURO)243mn pre-pandemic profit in the first quarter of the 2020 fiscal year.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary warned that the war and potential for new Covid-19 outbreaks ahead meant the 
recovery was "strong but still fragile".
Nevertheless, Ryanair had locked in cost savings and had secured a "massive competitive advantage" through fuel 
and other hedging, Neil Sorahan, chief financial officer, told the Financial Times.
In addition, Ryanair was taking delivery of 50 new Boeing 737 higherefficiency, lower-emission aircraft this winter, 
"so I believe we'll perform well in a recession, if there is one", he added.
While Ryanair is not cancelling flights,
Ryanair back in profit but warns days of (EURO)9.99 flights coming to end Airlines
Sorahan warned that air traffic control and other problems meant passengers could still expect more summer 
delays at European airports that have inflicted misery on holidaymakers in recent weeks.
He suggested passengers would also have to get used to higher fares.
"Fuel has gone from $40 a barrel to over $100 a barrel. So it's not credible that we will continue to offer those kinds 
of terms in a high fuel environment," he said.
"The days of the (EURO)9.99 fares are probably coming to an end."
Passenger numbers reached 45.5mn in the first quarter, and the airline had its busiest month ever in June.
Sorahan said Ryanair remained on track to reach 165mn passengers this financial year.
Stephen Furlong, airlines analyst at Davy stockbrokers in Dublin, said the airline's market share gains as Covid-19 
restrictions had eased, such as a 14 per cent rise in Italy, were "staggering".
Ryanair said its net debt had fallen to (EURO)0.4bn from (EURO)1.45bn at its March 31 year-end.
Without the Ukraine war, which hit Easter passenger numbers, "we probably would have been on track for 
something like pre-Covid [levels]", Sorahan said.
Ryanair has been able to bounce back quickly because it cut salaries rather than dismissing staff during the 
pandemic, and said it had agreed pay restoration deals with 80 per cent of pilots and 70 per cent of cabin crews.
This summer, it is operating 73 of the low-emission 737 aircraft, which it says deliver 4 per cent more seats but burn 
16 per cent less fuel and are 40 per cent quieter.
"I think the message to our customers is that we have the latest technology and voluntary carbon offsets," Sorahan 
said. "That's the way to fly. People are not going to stop flying."

Ryanair's net income of (EURO)170m (£144m) was ahead of analysts' consensus of between (EURO)154m and 
(EURO)157m. The airline's fares and revenues were also ahead of estimates, while costs were higher than 
expected at (EURO)2.3bn. Analysts said "whilst visibility is therefore limited, second quarter average fares are 
tracking ahead of peak S19 fares by a low double digit percentage."
Analysts at Peel Hunt have picked the numbers of SIG and confirmed their Buy recommendation at a 68p target 
price. The UK-based construction products supplier yesterday announced the acquisition of construction

FTSE 100 fell slightly, losing 20 points to 7,255. It is set to be a busy week for the market, with a host of trading 
updates and economic data on the way.
Vodafone got the ball rolling, reporting revenue growth in the first quarter of 2023. The mobile phone operator said 
performance was driven by contractual annual price increases, customer base growth and higher roaming revenue. 
  
Ryanair said it's unsure it will return to pre-COVID levels of profitability this year. This was despite topping first-
quarter estimates, with chief executive Michael O'Leary saying there was "a very strong but still fragile recovery."
AstraZeneca's asthma treatment received EU approval for marketing as an add-on therapy for patients 12 and over. 
 Tezspire helps patients with severe asthma.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) has admitted it cannot provide meaningful profit guidance for the full year against 
the backdrop of economic turmoil, the conflict in Ukraine and the possibility new Covid strains could unsettle the 
international travel market.
"We have limited visibility into the second half of Q2 and almost zero visibility into H2, when we are typically loss-
making," the budget airline's investors were told.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said he hoped to provide a forecast alongside November's interim results 
statement.
The words of caution followed what on the face of it was a robust first-quarter showing with the group posting a 
(EURO)170mln profit after tax compared with a loss of (EURO)273mln at the same point last year.
Customer numbers grew by 461% to 45.5mln, while the load factor (reflecting how full Ryanair's planes were over 
the three months ended June 30) was 92% - a 19-point improvement over 12 months.
Looking ahead, the Irish carrier made mention of soaring fuel prices. And, while the group is hedged in this regard 
(meaning it has insurance against rising fuel costs), its bills will rise by around 20% over the remainder of the 
financial year.
The company, while unwilling to commit to an earnings forecast, reckons it will carry 165mln passengers during the 
current 12 months, up 11% on pre-Covid levels.
Ryanair says too much turbulence to make accurate profit forecast
CEO O'Leary said: "While we remain hopeful that the high rate of vaccinations in Europe will allow the airline and 
tourism industry to fully recover and finally put Covid behind us, we cannot ignore the risk of new Covid variants in 
Autumn 2022. 
"Our experience with Omicron last November, and the Ukraine invasion in February, shows how fragile the air 
travel market remains, and the strength of any recovery will be hugely dependent upon there being no adverse or 
unexpected developments over the remainder of [the year]."

Ryanair on Monday Jul. 25 said that Boeing had warned it of possible delays to 21 737 MAX aircraft due for delivery 
before the end of the year and said it was also worried about the certification of the new MAX 10 aircraft.
Boeing remains a "major area of concern" for Ryanair, one of the U.S. aerospace giant's leading customers, Group 
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told investors on a call following the release of quarterly results.
Asked about O'Leary's comments, a spokesperson for Boeing said it valued its partnership with Ryanair and was 
committed to supporting the Irish airline.
O'Leary said he was confident that Boeing would deliver all 50 737 MAX aircraft due by next summer but he was 
concerned about a possible repeat of delays this year that forced it to take deliveries during its busy summer 
season.
"In the last two weeks, we're getting letters out of Boeing telling us there might be problems with 21 aircraft this side 
of Christmas," O'Leary told investors on a conference call. A delay would be "inexplicable and unacceptable," he 
added.
O'Leary said that he had been assured that Ryanair deliveries would take priority this winter.
Ryanair last year walked away from negotiations with Boeing for 200 of the MAX 10. The MAX 10 program, which 
has not yet been certified, received a boost at Britain's Farnborough Airshow last week with Delta Air Lines ordering 
100 and Qatar Airways 25.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday reported a sharp rise in first-quarter revenue, beating pre-Covid 
numbers and sending the budget airline back into profit, even as Easter bookings and fares were badly damaged by 
the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February.
For the three months to June 30, revenue was EUR2.60 billion, multiplied from EUR370 million in the first quarter 
last year. This helped swing the Dublin-based carrier to a profit after tax of EUR170 million from a EUR273 million 
loss a year before. However, the firm noted this was below its pre-Covid profit of EUR243 million in the first quarter 
of its financial year 2020, which ended June 30, 2019. 
Notably, the airline counted more passengers in the quarter to June 30 and higher revenue than in the quarter to 
June 30, 2019. Customer numbers were up 7.9% to 45.5 million from 41.9 million. 
Revenue increased 13% to EUR2.60 billion from EUR2.31 billion three years ago. The load factor however was 
lower at 92% from 96%. 
Average fares were down 4% on the same quarter pre-Covid, but ancillary revenue continued to perform strongly, 
delivering over EUR22.50 per passenger, Ryanair noted.
Looking ahead, Ryanair said it could not "ignore the risk" of new Covid variants in autumn. The Dublin-based carrier 
pointed to its experience with Omicron last November and the Ukraine invasion to demonstrate how "fragile the air 
travel market remains". Ryanair said the strength of any recovery will be dependent on there being no adverse or 
unexpected developments over the remainder of financial 2023.
The airline said it is "clear signs of pent-up demand". Average fares in the second quarter of its financial year are 
tracking ahead of pre-Covid levels by a low double-digit percentage, having been 4% down in the first quarter.
However, bookings remain closer-in than normal, leaving the company with "almost zero visibility into H2".

Ryanair expects to return to pre-COVID profit levels this year or next but the recovery remains fragile and could still 
be knocked off course by oil prices, geopolitics or an Omicron wave, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on 
Monday.
O'Leary was speaking after his airline, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, posted a profit of 170 million euros 
($174 million) for the three months to the end of June, the first quarter of its financial year.
That was well short of the 243 million euro profit in the same quarter of 2019, when it flew 15% fewer passengers, 
but ahead of the 157 million forecast in a company poll of analysts.

 Ryanair[1] ended the first quarter of its financial year 2023 with a profit, the first one since Q1 FY2020. Revenues 
soared, but the Irish low-cost isn't comfortable about how the rest of FY23 could be panning out as new Covid 
variants could push it back into a loss for the autumn and winter. Ryanair back to profit but future remains uncertain. 
Ryanair reported a €170 million net profit after tax compared to a €-272.6 million loss for the same April-June period 
last year. The operating profit was €219.6 million versus €-304.5 million last year. Total revenues soared from 
€370.5 million to €2.6 billion, of which €1.6 billion is from tickets and the rest from ancillary revenues. Russia's 
invasion of Ukraine in February damaged Ryanair's Easter bookings and has resulted in a four percent drop in 
ticket prices over Q1 2019. The group carried 45.5 million passengers, up from 8.1 million in the same period last 
year, and plans to grow to 165 million for the full year. 
Also soaring were the carrier's operating expenses, which were up to €2.4 billion from €675 million. Fuel costs were 
up to €1.0 billion from €156.6 million in Q1 FY22, but route charges, staff costs, and airport and handling costs were 
also up as Ryanair operated at higher capacity compared to last year. Actually, Ryanair and its subsidies Malta Air, 
Buzz, and Lauda Air operated at 115 percent capacity over pre-pandemic levels. 
Its business and customers suffered from 'unprecedented air traffic control and airport handling delays', affecting 
punctuality. Q2 will certainly include more about disruptions, as Ryanair suffered the effects of multiple strikes of 
cockpit and cabin crew in Italy, Spain, France, and Belgium in July. Michael O'Leary referred to the strikes as 'PR 
noise from minority unions in Spain, they are not supported by our cabin crews and pilots. In Belgium, they were 
supported by them, but remember that these strikes affected never more than one percent of our 3.000 daily flights.' 
He said that Ryanair has negotiated new agreements with unions that will restore previously agreed pay cuts. 'To 
date, accelerated pay restoration agreements have been agreed with unions representing over eighty percent of our 
pilots and approximately seventy percent of our cabin crews across Europe. We hope to conclude agreements with 
the small remaining balance in the near future.' 
Blurred visibility 
That near future has blurred visibility for the low-cost carrier. 'While there are clear signs of pent-up demand, 
bookings remain closer-in than was the norm (pre-Covid) at this time of year. We have limited visibility into the 
second half of Q2 and almost zero visibility into H2, when we are typically loss-making,' Michael O'Leary says, who 
Ryanair back to profit but future remains uncertain
warned earlier of another full-year loss. This means that even as we are already in the final week of July, the 
situation for September is unclear. In March, the carrier said that it expected reasonable profitability for FY23.[2] 
Ryanair is worried about the effects of new Covid variants and rising infections in the coming autumn and describes 
the current situation of the industry as 'fragile': 'The strength of any recovery will be hugely dependent upon there 
being no adverse or unexpected developments over the remainder of FY23.' It, therefore, is unable to give 
guidance on the rest of FY23. 
Fuel costs have been hedged this year at eighty percent, but that still leaves the airline exposed to twenty percent 
of the volatile fuel and oil costs. Still, it says it is in a significantly stronger position compared to competitors. For 
FY24, Ryanair has so far hedged thirty percent. 
Fleet 
Ryanair has taken delivery of 32 Boeing MAX 8200s this year until the end of June, bringing the fleet to 73. Another 
fifty MAX of the 210 on order are scheduled for delivery until the summer of 2023. Already last March, O'Leary said 
that he might extend the operating leases of some 737-800s to make up for the delayed MAX deliveries. He said 
today that Ryanair has reviewed the 737NG leasing options, but only announced that it has extended the lease of 
twenty Airbus A320ceo's with Lauda by four years until 2028. 
Ryanair ended the quarter with €4.6 billion in liquidity, up €1.0 billion from March, or €17 billion including assets. 
Total debt was reduced by €0.1 billion to €5.0 billion, with net debt down from €1.5 to €0.4 billion.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA), easyJet PLC (LSE:EZJ) and BA owner International Airlines Group are all due to 
post financial results next week, following an unprecedented summer of flight chaos.  
After a miserable 2022 affected by pandemic restrictions, Ryanair could surprise the market after it boosted traffic 
levels during the first quarter. 
The budget airline's traffic levels were 109% of the volume seen in the first quarter of 2020 during the opening 
quarter of its new fiscal year, UBS said in a week ahead forecast.  
Analysts predict it could post revenues of approximately (EURO)2.5bn for the quarter, and earnings before interest 
and taxes of (EURO)181ml compared to last year's losses, even possibly upgrading its future guidance.  
International Airlines has similarly benefited from improved traffic levels, amounting to a 70% sequential increase in 
the second quarter, UBS estimates.  
Analysts forecast a sequential and year-on-year improvement in the group's revenues to about (EURO)5.2bn 
compared to (EURO)3.4bn in the first quarter.  
"We expect investor focus will be on forward bookings/yields, resolution of staffing/ disruption issues, capacity 
redeployment, cash burn rate, hedging of fuel and the financial position of the balance sheet," UBS analysts said in 
a note on Friday.  
Airlines tipped for lift-off despite summer cancellations
Meanwhile, easyJet delivered 87% of capacity in the third quarter of its fiscal year 2022, versus pre-Covid levels, up 
from 67% in the second quarter.  
The market consensus is that the budget airline will deliver £1.7bn of revenue for the quarter, a vast improvement 
on last year's equivalent turnover.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has blamed the government's "bizarre" post-Brexit immigration policies for staff 
shortages which are contributing to ongoing air travel disruptions.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4, the head of the Dublin-based budget airline said: "We have this bizarre situation at the 
moment that in the UK I can get visas to bring Moroccans to come in and work as cabin crew. But I can't get visas 
for Portuguese or Italians or Slovakian youngsters. We just need a bit of more common sense and a practical 
approach to how we implement Brexit."
While airlines struggle to fill cabin crew positions, airports are finding it difficult to recruit handling and security staff, 
O'Leary explained.
Brexit not to blame, says government
Heathrow has been particularly hit by the ongoing travel chaos, although transport secretary Grant Schapps has 
previously denied that Brexit is to blame.
Appearing on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme back in June, Schapps pointed out that airports across 
Europe are facing similar issues.
"If it was just the Brexit issue, then that wouldn't be the case," he said.
Resonding to O'Leary's latest statements, a government spokesperson said: ": "Leaving the EU enabled us to 
introduce a points-based immigration system and we want to see employers make long-term investments in the 
"Bizarre" immigration rules contributing to travel chaos says Ryanair boss
UK's domestic workforce, such as training, wage increases and better career options, instead of relying on labour 
from abroad."
O'Leary warned that further flight cancellations should be expected, although disruption should ease off after the 
peak period.
""I think everybody would be able to staff up and gear up on time as long as we don't have any adverse Covid 
developments," he suggested.

An avalanche of news awaits investors next week with a stack of FTSE 100 stalwarts reporting alongside the US 
tech giants, oh and there's also a US interest rate decision on Wednesday.
Where to start is likely to be the biggest problem, but for market watchers, it is likely to be what the Fed does that 
garners the most attention.
Wall Street got a real dose of the jitters when US inflation jumped to 9.1% or the biggest year-on-year increase 
since November 1981.
Some economists suggested it might prompt the Fed to raise US interest rates by a full 1% at next week's meeting, 
instead of the 0.75% expected.
Comments since then by Fed members have eased some of the concerns, but with the ECB surprising Europe with 
a 0.5% rate hike this week nothing is being taken for granted.
FOMC minutes from the June meeting showed the US economic outlook warranted moving to a restrictive stance of 
policy and "recognised the possibility that an even more restrictive stance could be appropriate if elevated inflation 
pressures were to persist".
According to the CME Fedwatch service, markets are now pricing in a 70% likelihood of a 0.75% increase to 2.50% 
and a 30% chance of the full one-point hike
Week ahead: Avalanche of news including Lloyds Bank , Shell , Apple , Amazon and US rate decision
More pertinent for equity markets will be the quantitative tightening plan, which is already having a big impact on US 
tech stocks for example which have seen huge swings in prices recently.
The Fed's balance sheet has so far shrunk by $66bn from its peak, according to CME, as it reduces Quantitative 
Easing at the rate of $47.5bn a month.
The pace is expected to rise to US$95bn a month in September though as AJ Bell's Russ Mould points out at 
US$8.9trn the Fed's assets are still 8% higher than a year ago and more the double the level before the pandemic.
Floods of company news
In the UK, it's more of a question of which FTSE 100 companies are not reporting.
Next week sees updates from GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, BT, Lloyds Bank, Barclays, NatWest, Shell, Reckitt 
Benckiser, Unilever and Vodafone plus many more.
Likewise, the US is dominated by the FAANG tech brigade with  Amazon, Apple, Alphabet (Google) and Meta 
(Facebook) all issuing updates.

 The temporary disruption at London's Luton Airport on Monday when soaring temperatures caused a small section 
of the asphalt to lift is an example of the challenges airports face in making their infrastructure resilient to climate 
change, experts say. 
Below is an explanation of how global airports are coping with extreme heat and what may be needed to prevent 
future interruption from further heatwaves. 
WHAT HAPPENED AT LUTON AND WHY? 
The Luton runway was closed for nearly two hours on Monday, prompting airlines to delay or divert flights as 
temperatures rose above 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 Fahrenheit), adding to industry headaches in what has been a 
chaotic summer travel season in Europe. 
A long-standing patch repair to a small section of the runway - the equivalent of 0.2% of the entire surface area - 
became so hot that it de-bonded and began to lift, a spokesperson for the airport said on Friday, adding it was 
repaired within two hours. 
It is built to the same specification as others in Britain, meeting industry safety standards and regulations, the 
spokesperson said. 
"We continue to evaluate all options regarding the ongoing maintenance and long-term resilience of all of our 
infrastructure." 
The spokesperson did not comment on questions about the timing of the runway's resurfacing, the type of asphalt 
used or any possible changes to the material. 
Runways are typically resurfaced every 10 to 15 years. 
Experts say the airport, one of Britain's busiest and used by budget airlines including Ryanair and EasyJet, may be 
more vulnerable to heat because it is at a higher elevation than the others surrounding the capital: Heathrow, 
Gatwick and Stansted. 
Luton's climate change adaptation report released in November 2021 warned one of the key risks was high 
temperatures causing infrastructure damage or impacting operations. 
The airport said in the medium term it would need to ensure all airfield resurfacing projects considered the impact of 
increasing temperatures. 
HOW DO OTHER AIRPORTS COPE WITH EXTREME HEAT? 
Explainer-Luton Airport Runway Meltdown Shows Airports Vulnerable To Climate Change
The surface materials used depend on the climate and local conditions as well as other factors such as cost. 
Concrete is better than asphalt at withstanding extreme heat, though it is also more expensive and not as suitable 
in areas prone to ground settlement problems, Greg White, director of the Airport Pavement Research Program at 
Australia's University of the Sunshine Coast, said this week. 
The United States has a mix of runway types, while in the Middle East, the biggest hub Dubai uses "multiple layers 
of asphalt," according to a Dubai Airports video on a recent runway rehabilitation project. 
In Britain and Australia, asphalt runways are most common, he said, though they use different stiffness levels 
depending on the local climate. 
That means in Australia, where summer temperatures of 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) are not 
unprecedented, asphalt runways do not melt like they did at Luton. 
"This would only happen in Australia if Australia got to 50 degrees. It would probably only happen in the Middle East 
if the Middle East got to 60 degrees," White said. "You need something that's outside of the norm. But it can 
happen at the cold end as well. You'll get different failures, but it can happen in extreme cold if you've got 
something that's been engineered and designed for much warmer weather." 
Luton could make its runway more resistant to a high temperature, but that would in turn make it more susceptible 
to an extremely low temperature, White said. 
WHAT ARE THE OTHER CHALLENGES FOR AIRPORTS? 
Airports Council International (ACI), a group representing airports globally, said it will soon publish an airfield 
maintenance handbook for members with a section dedicated to pavement management. 
"This includes lists of probable cause of pavement distresses, and some are related to climate," an ACI 
spokesperson said. 
Runway patches are only one of the potential challenges faced by airports as temperatures rise, with others 
including airplanes requiring longer take-off distances and weight restrictions in hotter conditions. 
As temperatures get warmer, aeroplanes need a longer time and more fuel to take off, because hot air is thinner. 
A Federal Aviation Administration study issued in November 2021 showed runways at eight or nine of the 30 
busiest U.S. airports may need to be extended by at least 500 feet (152 metres) due to future increases in 
temperature or higher rainfall, which requires more braking distance. 
Rising sea levels and more powerful storms mean many airport operators are also investing in measures such as 
higher runways, seawalls and better drainage systems to future-proof their immovable assets.

Travel and Tourism Influencer Platform.
Body
The top tweets are based on total engagements (likes and retweets) received on tweets from more than 164 airlines 
experts tracked by GlobalData's Travel and Tourism Influencer platform during the second quarter (Q2) of 2022. 
The top tweets on airlines in Q2 2022: Top five1. Guillaume Faury's tweet on the Qantas and Airbus partnership for 
sustainable aviation fuelGuillaume Faury, CEO of airline company Airbus, tweeted on the airline and aerospace 
company Qantas and Airbus have collaborated with a common goal of producing and delivering large volumes of 
affordable, sustainable aviation fuel. The Australian Government announced that the two companies would be 
investing a total of $200m to bolster Australia's sustainable aviation fuel sector. The article detailed that sustainable 
fuels help in cutting greenhouse gas emissions by about 80% compared to traditional fuels, and can also be used in 
the existing engines without the need to modify them. Experts claim that the move to sustainable fuels is the easiest 
way for the aviation sector, especially for medium and long-haul flights, to cut emissions, the article detailed. 
Despite Australia exporting tonnes of feedstock, such as canola and animal tallow, each year, which can be 
converted into sustainable fuel, the country lacks a commercial domestic sustainable aviation fuel sector. 
The funding is expected to lower emissions and sustain jobs and industries, the article noted. We are proud to 
announce a new partnership with @Qantas at #IATAAGM with the common goal to produce and deliver large 
volumes of affordable sustainable aviation fuel. pic.twitter.com/O1bVjSceX3 - Guillaume Faury (@GuillaumeFaury)

Calder's tweet on the UK government ordering airlines to cancel summer flightsSimon Calder, a travel journalist and 
broadcaster, shared an article on the Department for Transport (DfT) and Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) ordering 
airlines to cancel flights for the months of July and August rather than days or hours ahead. In a joint letter to the 
airlines, the government bodies ordered airlines for early cancellations and to maintain a more robust schedule, and 
to prevent late-notice on-the-day cancellations, the article detailed. The ruling implied that many flights booked for 
July, August, and September would have to be cancelled. In addition, passengers would have to re-book their 
flights choosing other departures, the cost of which will be borne by the airline grounding their flights or cancelling

for a refund, the article further noted. The letter was specifically targeted easyJet, Britain's largest budget airline that 
has already cancelled about 60 flights every day, a majority of them to and from the London Gatwick airport. Wizz 
Air, the third biggest European carrier also cancelled some flights on short notice, after Ryanair and easyJet. The 
move was made by the government to de-risk the summer period to encourage airlines to deliver a schedule that 
could be maintained, the article highlighted. Department for Transport and Civil Aviation Authority have at last told 
airlines" Cancel a slab of peak summer flights now rather than just days (or hours) ahead. When you cancel, you 
must offer same-day alternative flights even if it means paying rivals.https://t.co/yp7Tg2hYxT - Simon Calder

3. Jamie Freed's tweet on US assisting China in the crashed Boeing jet investigationJamie Freed, an aviation and 
defence correspondent, tweeted on the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirming that it is 
helping the Civil Aviation Administration of China in the investigation of its China Eastern Flight 5735 that crashed 
on 21 March in southern China. According to an NTSB spokesperson, US investigators were helping China to 
download the cockpit voice recorder from the China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 at its Washington laboratory. 
The article further noted that China's need to send an importance piece of evidence to Washington for help 
depicted the urgency of the investigation despite the countries being at odds with each other. The China Eastern 
Flight 5735 crash caused 132 deaths and is expected to be China's biggest aviation disaster since the past 28 
years. The article highlighted that the recovery crews had retrieved a second black box, the flight data recorder, 
from the wreckage. WASHINGTON, April 1 (Reuters) - The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed 
late on Friday the cockpit voice recorder from a China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 that crashed March 21 is at 
the U.S. agency's lab in Washington. - Jamie Freed (@Jamie_Freed) April 1, 2022Username: Jamie Freed Twitter

the rising air travel demandJon Ostrower, editor-in-chief at the aviation news agency the Air Current, tweeted on 
passengers demanding airlines to meet the rising air travel demand. The article shared detailed how the US airline 
industry had told the Congress that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) must ensure that the country's 
airspace and air traffic control can handle the rising air travel demand. Trade group Airlines for America (A4A), for 
instance, had earlier stated that the industry was aggressively working on aligning schedules with the available 
workforce, but that the FAA also needed to take steps to handle the growing demand. The Democratic Senators 
Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey questioned A4A, which represented the American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, 
United Airlines, and other airlines after over 2,700 Memorial Day weekend flights were cancelled, the article 
detailed. The senators stated that the number of delays and cancellations during the weekend raised questions 
over airline decision-making. The airline industry is bracing itself for the summer as air travel demand has been 
accelerating amid staff shortages resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, the article further noted. The FAA had 
stated in a May letter that it would improve air traffic control at its Jacksonville, Florida centre after unfavourable 
weather and space launches caused the scrambling of flights. Meanwhile, FAA facility staffing challenges have 
significantly impacted California, Florida, and New York operations. Passengers also say airlines must ensure 
airlines can meet demand. https://t.co/izPxpDuOBr - Jon Ostrower (@jonostrower) June 14, 2022Username: Jon

attendants for working while boarding flightsThe Points Guy (TPG), a travel website, shared an article on the Delta 
Air Lines looking to pay flight attendants for working while boarding flights, the first airline to do so in the US. Earlier, 
flight attendants were paid only when the aircraft door closed, and not for assisting passengers down the aisle, for 
placing luggage in the overhead compartment, or for any changes in seating arrangements, the article noted. 
However, starting 2 June, flight attendants with Delta would be earning between $16.10 and $36.19 per hour, 
based on their seniority levels. Additionally, the shortest minimum boarding time for domestic narrow-body aircraft 
would be extended from 35 to 40 minutes, resulting in additional time for the attendants to be paid for. As a result, 
flight attendants could expect to earn an extra of $10.79 to $30.04 per flight, based on the type of aircraft, flight, and 
one's rank, the article detailed. Delta further announced that boarding pay will come in addition to a 4% pay rise for 
all flight attendants. The pay increase comes at a time to prevent flight attendants to join the Association of Flight 
Attendants-CWA (AFA), a union representing flight attendants across the US, the article highlighted. Delta's flight 
attendants are the only ones among the major US airlines to not belong to a union or have a collective bargaining 
clause in place. Delta will pay flight attendants for working while boarding flights, a major change-up

Airlines including British Airlines, easyJet and Ryanair have received a letter jointly penned by the Competition and 
Markets Authority (CMA) and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) stressing their concerns over recent flight 
cancellations and reimbursements.
The industry has come under scrutiny for a raft of last-minute cancellations due to staff shortages, leaving holiday 
goers stranded.
Specifically, the two regulators noted additional measures that should be taken to ease the burden.
Those including flights which are currently selling more tickets than they can reasonably expect to supply, not 
satisfying obligations for re-routing and failing to give full and clear information to customers about their rights after 
cancellations.
Last month the CAA teamed up with the government to tell airlines to cancel flights early to avoid airport chaos this 
summer, while airports including Gatwick and Heathrow have set daily limits. 
Shares in BA owner International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (LSE:IAG), easyJet PLC and Wizz Air Holdings 
PLC (AIM:WIZZ) were all down more than 2% on Thursday, while Ryanair Holdings PLC was only 0.3% lower.   
Danni Hewson, a financial analyst at AJ Bell said that airlines in this situation must be transparent.
"It's about transparency and boosting confidence, both things which are in airlines' best interests."
"The sector needs bookings to stay robust if it is to recover from its COVID crisis."

Ryanair has welcomed the ballot approval by its Spanish based pilots on post-Covid pay restoration, which follows 
the recent acceptance by its French based pilots of a similar agreement. These agreements with the SEPLA 
(Spain) and SNPL (France) unions deliver accelerated pay restoration and future improvements to pay in each year 
up to March 2027.
This year the airline will grow to 115% of its pre-Covid capacity and is prioritising the early restoration of pay for its 
people through these re-negotiated agreements to keep jobs secure and to have a foundation for growth. These 
new accelerated deals also provide for pay enhancements and other benefits beyond full restoration of pay for 
Ryanair's Spanish and French based Pilots over 5 years to March 2027.
Ryanair's People Director, Darrell Hughes said: <i>"We welcome these long-term agreements which run until 2027 
and will deliver numerous improvements for our pilots based in Spain and France.</i> <i>While the recovery from 
the impact of the pandemic is still ongoing and our industry faces significant challenges, this long-term agreement 
delivers stability, accelerated pay restoration, future pay increases and other benefit improvements for pilots.</i> 
<i>While all of our pilots across our European network are covered by 2020 Emergency Agreements, we continue 
to work with our pilots and their unions on new deals, similar to those concluded with SEPLA and SNPL, and have 
now successfully re-negotiated accelerated pay restoration and improved long-term agreements with over 85% of 
our pilots."</i>

Asia Pacific needs to improve low-cost carrier network to boost intra-regional travel
Asia Pacific needs to improve low-cost carrier network to boost intra-
regional travel

Highlight: Countries in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region need to improve their underdeveloped, low-cost carrier 
network to increase and promote intra-regional travel, using Europe as a model.
Body
The higher cost of air travel within the APAC tends to deter would-be intra-regional travellers, whereas in Europe 
intra-regional travel is sometimes cheaper than a domestic rail journey. APAC needs to increase its low-cost carrier 
(LCC) routes in order to accelerate travel recovery post-pandemic and help tourism to maintain steady growth 
thereafter. APAC needs to look at Europe as a modelLCCs in Europe, such as Ryanair and EasyJet, have a large 
network that covers the whole continent, allowing them to develop direct routes and reduce air travel costs. 
Countries such as India and China already have under-developed LCCs, but in order to expand intra-regional 
travel, they need to consider Europe's LCC network as a model. Although the middle class is rising in the APAC, so 
is inflation. This has impacted traveller sentiment within Asia. According to GlobalData's consumer survey Q3 2021, 
50% and 56% of respondents from four APAC nations surveyed (China, India, Australia, and Singapore) indicated 
they consider accessibility and affordability, respectively, as the most important factors that determine where they 
vacation. This reflects the region's desire for inexpensive, direct connections, which are preferences to which LCCs 
play well. APAC must strengthen its current low-cost footprintGiven the size and number of nations in the APAC, 
the region already has substantial connectivity and several low-cost carriers such as AirAsia, SpiceJet, and Go 
First. However, they must improve in order to get a firm foothold and expand connectivity across the region. 
Furthermore, the formation of new low-cost carriers such as Akasa Air in India, which is set to begin operations by 
the end of the fiscal year 2022-2023, would aid the APAC in increasing air connectivity. Governments in the APAC 
region must support LCCs to continue growing their network in order to attract more international passengers from 
other regions and, as a result, improve inbound tourist income. This will not only assist tourism recovery in the 
immediate post-pandemic period, but will also help tourism thrive for years to come.

Disruptions curb bookings for Lufthansa , BA and rivals
Disruptions curb bookings for Lufthansa, BA and rivals

Demand for flying has fallen significantly among some of Europe's largest airlines, as disruption in the industry 
shows signs of hitting people's appetite for travel.
Bookings made in the first week of July for flights within Europe in July and August were 44 per cent below 2019 
levels, according to travel industry data company ForwardKeys.
The decline is a marked shift from the last week in May, when bookings for July and August were close to tracking 
2019 levels as airlines faced a surge in demand after the removal of all travel restrictions in Europe.
The data are drawn from an industrywide ticketing database and include all major national carriers such as 
Lufthansa, British Airways and Air France. However, it does not have sales from low-cost carriers such as Ryanair 
or easyJet, which have reported some of the strongest passenger demand this summer.
The slowdown in sales has combined with tens of thousands of flight cancellations to muddy the outlook for the 
industry, which is already buckling under the resurgence in passenger numbers and staff lay-offs.
"The increased level of disruption is substantially dampening demand, as we are seeing a dramatic slowdown in 
lastminute flight bookings, plus an increase in cancellations," said Olivier Ponti, an executive at ForwardKeys.
As of May 30, total bookings for flights within Europe in July and August made at any point this year were 17 per 
cent behind 2019 levels. But seven weeks later, that gap had widened another 5 percentage points to 22 per cent.
Disruptions curb bookings for Lufthansa , BA and rivals
London and Amsterdam, two capitals where airports have seen serious disruption, have been the worst hit with 11 
and 13 percentage point slowdowns.
Airline bosses have previously said consumer demand had held up well despite weeks of negative headlines about 
travel this summer, including about 30,000 flight cancellations by British Airways alone.
EasyJet's chief executive Johan Lundgren on Tuesday said his airline's operations had recovered after a difficult 
start to the summer.
"The things that actually are within our control [have] been stabilised," he added.

A report by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on the diversion of a Ryanair in May 2021 flight 
slams Belarus for endangering the safety of the aircraft and reveals new details about the actions of an air traffic 
controller.
Ryanair Flight FR4978, which flew from Athens (ATN) to Vilnius (VNO) on May 23, 2021, was diverted to land in 
Minsk (MSK) upon the instructions of Belarusian Air Traffic Control following an alleged bomb threat. Belarusian 
journalist and opposition activist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega were arrested by Belarusian 
security service KGB following the landing.
In the report, the ICAO Council condemns the actions of the Government of Belarus, stating that they endangered 
the safety of the aircraft, as well as contravened the spirit of Chicago convention.
According to the report, the bomb threat, which was used as a justification to divert the flight to Minsk and 
subsequently detain several of its passengers, was communicated upon the instructions of Belarusian government 
officials and was deliberately false.

Diverted Ryanair Flight Investigation Concludes Belarus 'Unlawful'

 The United Nations agency in charge of investigating the diversion of a Ryanair flight by Belarus last year 
announced Tuesday it has completed its review, once again pointing the finger at the "unlawful" actions carried out 
by Minsk. 
On May 23, 2021, a Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania was forced to land in Minsk, with Belarusian authorities 
arresting dissident journalist, Roman Protasevich, and his partner, Sofia Sapega, who were on board. 
"The ICAO Council concluded its discussions yesterday on the May 2021 incident in Belarus airspace involving 
Ryanair Flight FR4978, condemning the actions of the Government of Belarus in committing an act of unlawful 
interference," the International Civil Aviation Organization said in a statement. 
The investigation was extended in early January to establish certain "missing facts" and examine new information. 
The Montreal-based ICAO studied audio recordings of the Minsk air traffic controller who was monitoring the 
affected flight. 
The agency said that the bomb threat used as excuse to divert the aircraft was "deliberately false and endangered 
its safety." 
 Chief of the Belarus Air Force Igor Golub (L), Belarusian activist Roman Protasevich (C) and Chairman of the 
Investigative Committee of Belarus Dmitry Gora (R) enter a press center before a briefing for journalists and 
diplomats in Minsk on June 14, 2021 Photo: AFP / STRINGER  
"The threat was communicated to the flight crew upon the instructions of senior government officials of Belarus," it 
concluded. 
The statement added that the council representative of Russia -- a close ally of Minsk -- had "expressed his State's 
strong objection to identifying Belarus as the source of the unlawful interference which took place." 
It said that the council, made up of 36 countries, had asked its president to pass the findings of the investigation on 
to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. 
The ICAO's mission is to enact the rules governing global civil air transport, but it has no power to impose 
sanctions. 
In the event of a proven violation of international rules, its role is to provide support for any countries wishing to 
pronounce condemnations or apply sanctions, in accordance with the Chicago Convention on International Civil 
Aviation, the institution said. 
Last month, Sapega asked for a pardon from Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko after being sentenced to six 
years in prison for "inciting social hatred" and "illegal collection of personal data."

The International Civil Aviation Organization ICAO has deemed the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Belarus in 
May 2021 was "unlawful interference."
The Montreal-based UN specialized agency released a Tuesday statement after evaluating new material including 
audio recordings from the Minsk air traffic controller.
The bomb threat cited as a reason for the emergency landing was "deliberately false," endangered flight safety and 
was based on instructions from senior Belarusian government officials, the ICAO found.
Belarusian authorities forced Ryanair flight FR4978, which was on its way from Athens to Vilnius with more than 
100 people on board, to land in Minsk.
The anti-government Belarusian blogger Roman Protasevich, co-founder of the opposition Telegram 
channel Nexta, and his girlfriend at the time, Sofia Sapega, were among those on board.
Both were detained after the plane landed. The European Union closed its airspace to Belarusian aircraft 
afterwards.
Sapega was sentenced to six years in prison in May for running an opposition channel on Telegram. She asked 
Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko for a pardon in late June.
Protasevich is still facing trial, according to media reports.
The US indicted four Belarusian government officials in absentia in January over the forced landing.
Prosecutors in New York charged them with "conspiracy to commit aircraft piracy." They said four US citizens were 
among the passengers.

Airbus and Boeing have competed neck and neck for five decades in one of the world's great commercial rivalries. 
But, as the contest resumes in earnest in the wake of the pandemic, the old order has changed. Airbus now has a 
wide lead in the single-aisle market - the hottest area of aviation - leaving Boeing to grapple with how to bridge the 
gap.
The European company has grabbed new orders and market share with its A320 family of narrow-body jets, which 
predominantly serve shorter-haul destinations, to which travel has rebounded faster, compared with long-haul.
Latest figures to the end of June show that Airbus had close to 17,000 orders of its A320 and A220 aircraft, and has 
so far delivered just over 10,600. The A320 is now the best selling aircraft ever, overtaking US-based Boeing's 737 
jet.
Recent fleet data from aviation consultancy Cirium showed Airbus's A320 family with a "firm order backlog" market 
share of 59 per cent compared with Boeing's 737 family of jets.
Airbus market share climbs past Boeing Single-aisle airliners US group has fallen behind its European rival as it 
deals with fallout from 737 Max 8 crashes, wri....
The best-seller within the A320 family is the largest model, the A321neo, which is also offered with extra fuel tanks 
in long and extra-long range variants. Some airlines - such as America's JetBlue - now use these for long-haul 
flights that were traditionally flown by more expensive wide-body jets.
Airbus's market share is only likely to grow as the group moves ahead with aggressive plans to lift output of the jets 
to 75 a month by 2025, despite industrywide concerns about constraints in the supply chain. Production had 
reached a record 60 a month in 2019 before dropping to 40 a month when Covid hit.
Some analysts have questioned when Boeing will be able to regain some of that lost market share, as the company 
has continued to deal with fallout from the grounding of its 737 Max 8 after two fatal crashes within five months.
Global regulators have since cleared the jet to fly again after Boeing implemented software and design changes 
and the plane is notching up new orders.
Another challenge looming, however, is the recertification of the shorter 737 Max 7 and longer 737 Max 10 variants. 
Boeing is racing to complete those processes before the end of the year to avoid having to develop a new flight 
deck under rules introduced by US Congress following the Max crashes.
Boeing has also suffered production issues that have prevented customer Continued on page 3
Continued from page 1 deliveries of its wide-body 787 aircraft. In addition, development of its 777X aircraft has 
been delayed, while problems on a number of big defence contracts have only added to the challenges.
Delays on the commercial side have frustrated some of Boeing's largest customers, including Ryanair. The low-cost 
carrier's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, has said sweeping changes are needed to Boeing's senior management, 
led by chief executive Dave Calhoun.
In a recent interview, O'Leary told the Financial Times that the US aviation group has "lost huge market share and 
existing customers are being lost to Airbus, which is why I don't understand why they sit there and do nothing".
"I have a lot of time for Dave Calhoun ... but he's not in Seattle and the problems in Boeing lie in Seattle," he 
commented.
But others, including Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr, have continued to back the US company. Boeing 
has insisted that much has changed since the Max accidents. It is also ramping up the hiring of engineers as it 
works with the US aviation regulator to certify its upcoming 777X aircraft.
However, in a further blow, Boeing last month lost out to Airbus on a $37bn order from China's three big state 
airlines.
They chose 292 A320neo jets - the biggest order by Chinese airlines since the start of the pandemic. The country is 
a crucial market for both Airbus and Boeing and the orders come at a time of rising political tensions between the 
US and China.
Calhoun has previously cited uncertainty over orders from China as one of the three main risks facing the company, 
along with securely boosting production of the Max and resolving issues around the 787. China was the first country 
to ground the Max and, although its aviation regulator last year approved its return to service, Chinese carriers have 
not resumed flights.
The multibillion-dollar question facing Boeing, therefore, is how to recover its lead against Airbus, at the same time 
as China's first self-developed aircraft - Comac's narrow-body C919 - is finally nearing completion.
Boeing abandoned a plan for a new midsize aeroplane - a twin-aisle aircraft that would have sat between the 737 
Max and the larger 787 - and it remains unclear what its next step will be. Its balance sheet also remains 
constrained, with some $45bn of net debt.
Airbus market share climbs past Boeing Single-aisle airliners US group has fallen behind its European rival as it 
deals with fallout from 737 Max 8 crashes, wri....
The company needs to "launch an answer to the A321neo," says Kevin Michaels, managing director of Michigan-
based AeroDynamic Advisory. "Can they afford it? I think they can. Their balance sheet isn't great but you've got to 
invest in your core business to stay around in the long run."
"The other problem they face is knowing what to do ... The world is about to change massively but no one yet 
knows what that technology will be and you could end up spending $20bn on something that will be immediately 
obsolete," says Nick Cunningham, analyst at research firm Agency Partners in London. He believes Boeing needs 
to raise equity to fund a new programme.
But Calhoun recently played down any concerns about the company's market share position vis-à-vis Airbus. "At 
this moment in time, it's less important," he told an investor conference in June. Boeing, he added, had to 
concentrate on getting planes back in the air.
"We have to stay focused on doing that incredibly well. One aeroplane at a time. If I jump to a market share 
discussion immediately and say, 'Let's get above 50 and let's do it next year', what happens? The whole system 
gets crammed down in every way."
He also indicated that the performance improvement needed to justify an all new aircraft does not currently exist, 
and Boeing remains competitive. "I'm confident, my sales team is confident,"
Calhoun said. Additional reporting by Philip Georgiadis

Airbus and Boeing have competed neck and neck for five decades in one of the world's great commercial rivalries. 
But, as the contest resumes in earnest in the wake of the pandemic, the old order has changed. Airbus now has a 
wide lead in the single-aisle market - the hottest area of aviation - leaving Boeing to grapple with how to bridge the 
gap.
The European company has grabbed new orders and market share with its A320 family of narrow-body jets, which 
predominantly serve shorter-haul destinations, to which travel has rebounded faster, compared with long-haul.
Latest figures to the end of June show that Airbus had close to 17,000 orders of its A320 and A220 aircraft, and has 
so far delivered just over 10,600. The A320 is now the best selling aircraft ever, overtaking US-based Boeing's 737 
jet.
Recent fleet data from aviation consultancy Cirium showed Airbus's A320 family with a "firm order backlog" market 
share of 59 per cent compared with Boeing's 737 family of jets.

The best-seller within the A320 family is the largest model, the A321neo, which is also offered with extra fuel tanks 
in long and extra-long range variants. Some airlines - such as America's JetBlue - now use these for long-haul 
flights that were traditionally flown by more expensive wide-body jets.
Airbus's market share is only likely to grow as the group moves ahead with aggressive plans to lift output of the jets 
to 75 a month by 2025, despite industrywide concerns about constraints in the supply chain. Production had 
reached a record 60 a month in 2019 before dropping to 40 a month when Covid hit.
Some analysts have questioned when Boeing will be able to regain some of that lost market share, as the company 
has continued to deal with fallout from the grounding of its 737 Max 8 after two fatal crashes within five months.
Global regulators have since cleared the jet to fly again after Boeing implemented software and design changes 
and the plane is notching up new orders.
Another challenge looming, however, is the recertification of the shorter 737 Max 7 and longer 737 Max 10 variants. 
Boeing is racing to complete those processes before the end of the year to avoid having to develop a new flight 
deck under rules introduced by US Congress following the Max crashes.
Boeing has also suffered production issues that have prevented customer Continued on page 3
Continued from page 1 deliveries of its wide-body 787 aircraft. In addition, development of its 777X aircraft has 
been delayed, while problems on a number of big defence contracts have only added to the challenges.
Delays on the commercial side have frustrated some of Boeing's largest customers, including Ryanair. The low-cost 
carrier's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, has said sweeping changes are needed to Boeing's senior management, 
led by chief executive Dave Calhoun.
In a recent interview, O'Leary told the Financial Times that the US aviation group has "lost huge market share and 
existing customers are being lost to Airbus, which is why I don't understand why they sit there and do nothing".
"I have a lot of time for Dave Calhoun ... but he's not in Seattle and the problems in Boeing lie in Seattle," he 
commented.
But others, including Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr, have continued to back the US company. Boeing 
has insisted that much has changed since the Max accidents. It is also ramping up the hiring of engineers as it 
works with the US aviation regulator to certify its upcoming 777X aircraft.
However, in a further blow, Boeing last month lost out to Airbus on a $37bn order from China's three big state 
airlines.
They chose 292 A320neo jets - the biggest order by Chinese airlines since the start of the pandemic. The country is 
a crucial market for both Airbus and Boeing and the orders come at a time of rising political tensions between the 
US and China.
Calhoun has previously cited uncertainty over orders from China as one of the three main risks facing the company, 
along with securely boosting production of the Max and resolving issues around the 787. China was the first country 
to ground the Max and, although its aviation regulator last year approved its return to service, Chinese carriers have 
not resumed flights.
The multibillion-dollar question facing Boeing, therefore, is how to recover its lead against Airbus, at the same time 
as China's first self-developed aircraft - Comac's narrow-body C919 - is finally nearing completion.
Boeing abandoned a plan for a new midsize aeroplane - a twin-aisle aircraft that would have sat between the 737 
Max and the larger 787 - and it remains unclear what its next step will be. Its balance sheet also remains 
constrained, with some $45bn of net debt.

The company needs to "launch an answer to the A321neo," says Kevin Michaels, managing director of Michigan-
based AeroDynamic Advisory. "Can they afford it? I think they can. Their balance sheet isn't great but you've got to 
invest in your core business to stay around in the long run."
"The other problem they face is knowing what to do ... The world is about to change massively but no one yet 
knows what that technology will be and you could end up spending $20bn on something that will be immediately 
obsolete," says Nick Cunningham, analyst at research firm Agency Partners in London. He believes Boeing needs 
to raise equity to fund a new programme.
But Calhoun recently played down any concerns about the company's market share position vis-à-vis Airbus. "At 
this moment in time, it's less important," he told an investor conference in June. Boeing, he added, had to 
concentrate on getting planes back in the air.
"We have to stay focused on doing that incredibly well. One aeroplane at a time. If I jump to a market share 
discussion immediately and say, 'Let's get above 50 and let's do it next year', what happens? The whole system 
gets crammed down in every way."
He also indicated that the performance improvement needed to justify an all new aircraft does not currently exist, 
and Boeing remains competitive. "I'm confident, my sales team is confident,"
Calhoun said. Additional reporting by Philip Georgiadis

Belarus behind bomb hoax that grounded dissident's flight: ICAO
Belarus behind bomb hoax that grounded dissident's flight: ICAO

Jul 20, 2022( Al Jazeera English: https://www.aljazeera.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 The UN's aviation agency has, for the first time, accused senior Belarus officials of being behind the forced 
grounding of a flight between Greece and Lithuania that led to the arrest of a dissident journalist. 
Belarus air traffic controllers ordered the Ryanair flight to land in Minsk[1] as it was travelling between Athens and 
Vilnius in May 2021, citing a bomb threat. Belarus journalist Roman Protasevich was detained along with his then-
girlfriend once the plane was on the ground. 
After previously saying it did not know who was behind the fake threat, the International Civil Aviation Organization 
(ICAO) on Tuesday condemned Minsk for 'committing an act of unlawful interference' that contravened aviation 
rules. 
'The ICAO Council acknowledged that the bomb threat against (the flight) was deliberately false and endangered its 
safety, and furthermore that the threat was communicated to the flight crew upon the instructions of senior 
government officials of Belarus,' theagency said in a statement, citing new information. 
The agency, with headquarters in Montreal, Canada, added that Russia's representative strongly objected to the 
conclusion. Western nations, including Canada, have imposed sanctions on Belarus for supporting Russia's 
invasion of Ukraine. 
The Belarus foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ICAO statement. 
Minsk has previously insisted it acted legally and in accordance with all international norms, accusing Western 
countries of using the episode to try to undermine President Alexander Lukashenko. 
Shortly after he was detained, Protasevich, the former editor of an opposition news outlet, renounced his political 
activism and was released from jail into house arrest. Belarus opposition figures believe his recantation was 
coerced.

Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun has defended his record at America's largest aerospace company, insisting 
that he has sharpened its focus on engineering and that the indebted group could launch a new aircraft without 
having to raise money from shareholders.
Calhoun said the company had made significant progress since he took the top job two-and-a-half years ago, when 
Boeing was reeling from the grounding of its 737 Max following two crashes.
"We all have to put two-and-a-half years in perspective and what we've done as a leadership team to get ahead of 
each and every one of our big issues - and, no, they are not complete," Calhoun said in an interview. But a series of 
production delays have brought Boeing's shares down 30 per cent this year compared with an 11 per cent decline 
in those of its arch rival, Airbus.
Deliveries of its wide-body 787 Dreamliner remain on hold over quality control issues while there are questions over 
the approval of its 737 Max 10 jet by the US Federal Aviation Administration. Stabilising the production of the 737 
Max jet is another key challenge.

record and says management is getting on top of problems
Yet, speaking to the Financial Times on the eve of the biennial Farnborough Air Show, the 65-year-old struck a 
bullish tone on Boeing's prospects. Reflecting on his tenure since he took over in January 2020, he said: "I'm 
actually feeling pretty good about the moment. The most difficult of our crises is being managed effectively. It's not 
done and that's the Max. But we're still returning aeroplanes to service for our customers."
Demand from airlines for new planes, he added, had rebounded strongly following a pandemic that plunged the 
aviation industry into its biggest crisis in decades. "We're in full recovery mode on demand," he said.
Calhoun was "comfortable" that regulatory approvals to allow the resumption of deliveries of the 787 would happen 
but declined to offer a specific timeline. Regarding the 737 Max, the company was focused on ensuring it could 
reliably produce 31 planes a month.
Delays in the delivery of the 737 Max have drawn criticism of Boeing's leadership from some of its biggest 
customers, including Michael O'Leary, chief executive of low-cost carrier Ryanair.
Calhoun said he took O'Leary's com- ments "very seriously, because if we deliver a new aeroplane even a day late, 
that affects his business". He stressed, however, that his team was focused on a consistent production rate, adding: 
"My team is wrestling with this every day. I love them and I know we will get there."
Nevertheless, supply-chain constraints continue to disrupt the industry. Stan Deal, head of commercial aeroplanes 
at Boeing, highlighted engine delays and shortages of semiconductors and other parts as a key issue.
Calhoun also sought to address concerns over the group's engineering culture, saying that he had shaken up the 
group's management structures and put people closer to the operational centres.
One of his first acts was to ask Greg
Hyslop, Boeing's chief engineer, to leave his Chicago office and move to Seattle, the company's main commercial 
aircraft manufacturing base.
"My emphasis is distributed management, leadership close to the action," said Calhoun.
Hyslop told the FT: "I don't believe we've ever had a cultural issue around engineering at the Boeing company. I do 
believe there were changes needed [to] strengthen engineering and provide more of a degree of independence for 
engineering."
One of the strategic conundrums facing Boeing is how to close the gap with Airbus, which has extended its lead in 
the lucrative market for single-aisle aircraft that serve short and medium-haul destinations. The European 
aerospace group, which has an almost 60 per cent market share, recently secured a $37bn order from Chinese 
state airlines.
"I'm in 40 per cent [of the market]," said Calhoun. "And if the marketplace saw me delivering stably at 40 per cent 
they would be head over heels ecstatic. I think I'll be better than 40 per cent if I can get back on an equal footing in 
China."
Analysts have said that Boeing needs to launch a new plane to take on Airbus's best-selling A321neo, with some 
suggesting it will need to raise equity to do so, given its $45bn of net debt.
Calhoun played down that any launch was imminent, saying that advances in engine technology did not yet make it 
worthwhile. "The question about when you introduce a new commercial aeroplane ... has to do with the technology 
readiness with respect to the propulsion packages ... and whether they're going to create a big enough difference 
for the marketplace to then go out and place orders and I don't think we're at that threshold."
When the time is right Boeing could launch a new plane without raising new equity, Calhoun said, as the company's 
engineers are already building the digital infrastructure to enable the next plane, which will reduce the development

time. "It's important that those [technologies] be proven and available, the biggest one being the digital model, the 
digital twin for that development. And that is in full force," he said.
By the time Boeing needed to spend money, Calhoun added, the "cash flow numbers will be significantly different 
and, in my view, more than that.
"I believe it will be the ability to run a digital twin on a new commercial aeroplane that will enable us to reduce 
development time, strengthen product and factory safety and improve financial outcomes," he said.

Calhoun said the company had made significant progress since he took the top job two-and-a-half years ago, when 
Boeing was reeling from the grounding of its 737 Max following two crashes.
"We all have to put two-and-a-half years in perspective and what we've done as a leadership team to get ahead of 
each and every one of our big issues - and, no, they are not complete," Calhoun said in an interview. But a series of 
production delays have brought Boeing's shares down 30 per cent this year compared with an 11 per cent decline 
in those of its arch rival, Airbus.
Deliveries of its wide-body 787 Dreamliner remain on hold over quality control issues while there are questions over 
the approval of its 737 Max 10 jet by the US Federal Aviation Administration. Stabilising the production of the 737 
Max jet is another key challenge.
Boeing chief confident in upward trajectory Aerospace & defence. Production delays Calhoun defends his 
record and says management is getting on top of problems
Yet, speaking to the Financial Times on the eve of the biennial Farnborough Air Show, the 65-year-old struck a 
bullish tone on Boeing's prospects. Reflecting on his tenure since he took over in January 2020, he said: "I'm 
actually feeling pretty good about the moment. The most difficult of our crises is being managed effectively. It's not 
done and that's the Max. But we're still returning aeroplanes to service for our customers."
Demand from airlines for new planes, he added, had rebounded strongly following a pandemic that plunged the 
aviation industry into its biggest crisis in decades. "We're in full recovery mode on demand," he said.
Calhoun was "comfortable" that regulatory approvals to allow the resumption of deliveries of the 787 would happen 
but declined to offer a specific timeline. Regarding the 737 Max, the company was focused on ensuring it could 
reliably produce 31 planes a month.
Delays in the delivery of the 737 Max have drawn criticism of Boeing's leadership from some of its biggest 
customers, including Michael O'Leary, chief executive of low-cost carrier Ryanair.
Calhoun said he took O'Leary's com- ments "very seriously, because if we deliver a new aeroplane even a day late, 
that affects his business". He stressed, however, that his team was focused on a consistent production rate, adding: 
"My team is wrestling with this every day. I love them and I know we will get there."
Nevertheless, supply-chain constraints continue to disrupt the industry. Stan Deal, head of commercial aeroplanes 
at Boeing, highlighted engine delays and shortages of semiconductors and other parts as a key issue.
Calhoun also sought to address concerns over the group's engineering culture, saying that he had shaken up the 
group's management structures and put people closer to the operational centres.
One of his first acts was to ask Greg
Hyslop, Boeing's chief engineer, to leave his Chicago office and move to Seattle, the company's main commercial 
aircraft manufacturing base.
"My emphasis is distributed management, leadership close to the action," said Calhoun.
Hyslop told the FT: "I don't believe we've ever had a cultural issue around engineering at the Boeing company. I do 
believe there were changes needed [to] strengthen engineering and provide more of a degree of independence for 
engineering."
One of the strategic conundrums facing Boeing is how to close the gap with Airbus, which has extended its lead in 
the lucrative market for single-aisle aircraft that serve short and medium-haul destinations. The European 
aerospace group, which has an almost 60 per cent market share, recently secured a $37bn order from Chinese 
state airlines.
"I'm in 40 per cent [of the market]," said Calhoun. "And if the marketplace saw me delivering stably at 40 per cent 
they would be head over heels ecstatic. I think I'll be better than 40 per cent if I can get back on an equal footing in 
China."
Analysts have said that Boeing needs to launch a new plane to take on Airbus's best-selling A321neo, with some 
suggesting it will need to raise equity to do so, given its $45bn of net debt.
Calhoun played down that any launch was imminent, saying that advances in engine technology did not yet make it 
worthwhile. "The question about when you introduce a new commercial aeroplane ... has to do with the technology 
readiness with respect to the propulsion packages ... and whether they're going to create a big enough difference 
for the marketplace to then go out and place orders and I don't think we're at that threshold."
When the time is right Boeing could launch a new plane without raising new equity, Calhoun said, as the company's 
engineers are already building the digital infrastructure to enable the next plane, which will reduce the development 
Boeing chief confident in upward trajectory Aerospace & defence. Production delays Calhoun defends his 
record and says management is getting on top of problems
time. "It's important that those [technologies] be proven and available, the biggest one being the digital model, the 
digital twin for that development. And that is in full force," he said.
By the time Boeing needed to spend money, Calhoun added, the "cash flow numbers will be significantly different 
and, in my view, more than that.
"I believe it will be the ability to run a digital twin on a new commercial aeroplane that will enable us to reduce 
development time, strengthen product and factory safety and improve financial outcomes," he said.
'The most difficult of our crises is being managed effectively. It's not done and that's the Max'

US aircraft manufacturer Boeing kept its nose ahead of European rival Airbus in the race for new orders on the 
second day of the Farnborough International Airshow outside of London.
Private equity firm 777 Partners was buying 30 more Boeing 737 MAX medium-haul planes, the manufacturer said 
on Tuesday.
The aircraft will be a special 737-8-200 version with more seats and additional doors, which Boeing developed for 
low-cost carriers such as Ryanair.
There is also a preliminary contract with 777 Partners for 36 more aircraft.
Airbus meanwhile reported an order from US airline Delta for 12 A220-300 aircraft, the longer version of the 
smallest Airbus model A220.
On Monday, Delta said it was ordering 100 of Boeing's 737-10 jets, with options for an additional 30 planes from the 
company.
The Farnborough trade show, which runs through the week, is staged every two years and has become a venue for 
Boeing and Airbus to face off for new orders.

Extreme heat in the U.K. on Monday caused runway damage and disrupted military and civilian flying, airport 
officials said.
A heat wave has engulfed much of Western Europe, with temperatures in London forecast to rise to about 100 
degrees Fahrenheit on Monday and possibly higher on Tuesday before breaking midweek. The aviation industry is 
wrestling with the effects on infrastructure of extreme weather including storms, floods and high temperatures.
London Luton Airport briefly suspended flights on Monday but said operations were back up Monday evening.
"Following today's high temperatures, a surface defect was identified on the runway," the airport tweeted, 
apologizing for the inconvenience.
The airport is used by budget carriers including easyJet, Ryanair and Wizzair.
At Brize Norton Royal Air Force base in Oxfordshire, flying was halted after a similar report of runway damage.
"During this period of extreme temperature flight safety remains our top priority, so aircraft are using alternative 
airfields in line with a long established plan," an RAF spokesperson said. "This means there is no impact on RAF 
operations."
The RAF didn't specify why it suspended flights, but a spokesperson said "the runway has not melted" as early 
media reports indicated.
Heathrow Airport, the country's largest, said it is monitoring the impact of the heat and is so far operating normally. 
Gatwick Airport outside London also said it has not identified any runway problems due to heat.

Jul 18, 2022( Luxurylaunches: http://www.luxurylaunches.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 BMW has quietly started selling subscriptions for heated seats[1] in a number of countries, including the UK, 
Germany, New Zealand, and South Africa. The subscription-based model for features has been available on 
BMW[2] cars for some time in countries like the UK, but the heated seat option has been added this month. In 
addition to the UK, several online publications spotted its launch in South Korea earlier this month. Customers can 
pay a monthly fee of roughly $18 to use heated seats, while the German automaker has also provided options to 
subscribe for a year at $180, three years at $300, or pay $415 for 'unlimited' access. As expected, the roll-out of the 
feature by BMW has not been publicized much fearing widespread criticism and stiff resistance from customers and 
automotive enthusiasts. 
https://luxurylaunches.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/bmw-heated-seat-2.jpg 
It was back in 2020 when BMW[3] announced its plans to launch a subscription model for many of its features. All 
those features are available via BMW's ConnectedDrive online store and can be remotely activated by the 
automaker by paying a monthly fee. Some of them can be bought permanently for a one-time cost or trialed for a 
month before purchasing on subscription. The features locked behind a paywall include the heated steering wheel 
feature that starts at $12 a month; use footage from the car's cameras with a one-time fee of $235 for 'unlimited' 
use; and the $117 'IconicSounds Sport package' that emulates different engine sounds in your car. The Bavarian 
manufacturer has argued that the subscription model can be helpful for owners who change their minds after 
purchase and want to add more features. Furthermore, BMW claims that it could prove to be very useful for those 
buying used cars 'as they now have the opportunity to add features the original owner did not choose.' 
https://luxurylaunches.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/bmw-heated-seat-3.jpg 
The likely comparison However, the idea of offering car features as a subscription has drawn severe criticism. As 
pointed out by Daily Mail[4], many irked customers have voiced their displeasure on the internet and compared 
BMW with budget airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet that charge an extra fee for 'everything from baggage to 
food and the right to sit with family members.' One of the dissenters wrote: 'This is the most annoying thing I have 
ever heard. If you buy a car with heated seats, you shouldn't have to pay a subscription fee to use them.' while 
another one said: 'How utterly ridiculous. Pay to have hardware installed, then pay monthly to have the software

block removed that stops you operating it!' https://luxurylaunches.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/bmw-heated-
seat-4.jpgImage - Youtube Its not just BMW BMW is not the only automaker that has rolled out or is in the process 
of launching a subscription model for certain features. Audi, Cadillac, Porsche, and Tesla are all trying out this new 
business technique to make billions of dollars. Taking a leaf from the tech world's playbook, automakers have 
recognized the subscription model as a great way to get a stream of recurring revenue for years after an initial 
purchase. And as automobiles continue to become increasingly connected to the internet, expect more 
manufacturers to jump on the bandwagon. While this will be great for the bottom line of automobile manufacturers 
that have been financially struggling due to the transition towards electrification, be prepared to shell out hundreds 
of dollars in subscription fees to use the most basic features of your car.  
https://luxurylaunches.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/bmw-heated-seat-5.jpg 
BMW stands down - BMW finally issued a clarification Friday in an attempt to pacify dissenting owners and fans. 
The statement released by the Bavarian manufacturer is addressed exclusively to its US customers. 'If a vehicle is 
initially ordered with heated seats, that option will remain fully operational for the life of the vehicle,' BMW clarified. 
'BMW Functions on Demand on the other hand is designed to offer premium features through software upload that 
use data and sensors from factory option hardware already built into BMW vehicles.' It is important to remember 
that BMW's in-vehicle subscription service, called 'Functions on Demand,' is not currently available in the US.

ROME (AP) — Several hundred flights were canceled in Italy on Sunday, a peak vacation travel day, because of 
four-hour walkouts involving employees of low-cost airlines as well as air traffic controllers.
A union official, Fabrizio Cuscito, told Italian state TV that some 500 flights were scrapped. Airline workers are 
seeking better pay as well as improved working conditions, including meals on long shifts, he said.
The Italian transport ministry said the strikes were called by workers for Ryanair, easyJet and Volotea airlines. That 
strike began at 2 p.m. (1200 GMT), while the air traffic controllers' walkout, which also lasted four hours, started an 
hour earlier.
Compared to airports in other Western European countries, Italy’s airports have experienced less chaos this 
summer. That’s because in large part when the COVID-19 pandemic paralyzed travel, many airline and airport 
workers in Italy received government benefits while not working, instead of losing their jobs, as frequently happened 
in other countries.
When travel demand surged this summer, many airlines and airports couldn't hire enough workers fast enough to 
serve the customers.

7 Small-Cap Stocks that Present Long-Term Growth Opportunities[1] Before you invest in small-cap stocks, you 
should be comfortable with the risk that they present. By definition, a small-cap stock is one that has a market 
capitalization of less than $2 billion. But this leaves them prone to volatility. And when the market goes through a 
sell-off or correction these stocks can suffer steep losses. 
Those concerns are being amplified as the Federal Reserve is pledging to raise interest rates as part of their efforts 
to implement a less accommodative monetary policy. And that means if your investment timeline ends in the next 
few years, you may want to look elsewhere. 
However, if you have a longer time horizon, quality small-cap stocks have historically provided investors with an 
opportunity for high growth. In this special presentation, we're looking at seven small-cap stocks. Some have an 
interesting story that is playing out right now. Others have a narrative that should provide a catalyst for the stock 
once the economy is back on firm footing. 
Here are seven small-cap stocks we believe deserve a closer look.

Due to a threatened work stoppage at Italian airports, travellers have to be prepared for delays and cancellations of 
numerous flights on Sunday.
Several trade unions called on staff of the air traffic control company ENAV as well as the low-cost airlines Ryanair, 
EasyJet and Volotea to take part in the four-hour work stoppage, according to notices from the trade union 
confederations.
The reason is a dispute over workers' rights, working conditions and the payment of minimum wages in the 
industry.
EasyJet has cancelled flights from Milan's Linate airport to Berlin and from Rome-Fiumicino to Amsterdam because 
of the strike. Ryanair said it had been forced to cancel some flights because of the strike at ENAV. Passengers had 
already been informed, the airline said.
According to ENAV, the work stoppage will last from 2 pm to 6 pm (1200-1600 GMT). Flights between 7 am and 10 
am and 6 pm to 9 pm will not be affected.
With work stoppages looming, Tourism Minister Massimo Garavaglia called during the week for everything to be 
done to avoid inconvenience in the recovering sector.
"An unrest among air traffic control staff threatens to block the most dynamic sector of the economy, which is 
currently driving the country's growth to a significant extent. To block transport is to block the country," said the 
politician from the far-right Lega party, which is considered pro-business.

crisis.
Ten of the leading airlines in the US and Europe have built $193bn in gross debt between them over two years, up 
from $109bn in 2019.

Norwegian, which went through bankruptcy and debt restructuring in 2020 and 2021.

Jul 15, 2022( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Next week will see the official break up for all schools in the UK for the long awaited six-week summer holiday. 
However, whilst many are hoping to head abroad for their first foreign summer break since the onset of the COVID-
19 pandemic, the looming summer of discontent may have other ideas. 
With airline strikes, flight cancellations, missing luggage, staff shortages and queues at nearly every UK airport, the 
summer of travel chaos will hit the UK hard, and it now seems almost impossible to avoid. Alberto Lopez 
Valenzuela, Founder & CEO, alva asks how has the UK's transport sector seemingly imploded and where will it 
end? 
Union boom 
2022 has become the year of the union boom, and nowhere does this seem truer than the UK transport sector. With 
the threat of more tube and rail strikes still rumbling on, Ryanair, easyJet and BA staff are predominantly striking 
over working conditions and pay cuts that were ordered during the height of the pandemic. 
Yet with weeks of travel chaos about to hit the UK population, it is clear at this stage that public sentiment towards 
the strikes will continue to descend as the array of different union actions continue. The knock-on effect is already 
significant damage to the reputation of the industry as a whole - damage that may take years to rebuild. 
Additionally, the travel sector will lose vital revenue, making it even harder to afford pay increases, and travellers 
and businesses will become increasingly aggravated as they take the brunt of it all. The sector is already battling 
with what seems like a different daily crisis as it struggles to stay afloat of the demands of the peak summer 
season. Heathrow has just announced a daily cap of 100,000 passengers until September 11th and up to 1,000 
more flight cancellations. It is likely other airports will follow with their own heavy-handed restrictions. 
But will the vast level of strike action that will impact almost every airport in the UK be successful or cause further 
reputational damage for all involved? There is no denying that a company's brand is tainted by issues surrounding 
workers' pay structures and working conditions. It harms corporate reputations, employee engagement and the 
crucial recruitment drive. Additionally social media will ensure that everything is played out in real life and at 
lightning speed. But with the threat of more strike action throughout the summer months, is the transport sector at 
risk of causing more reputational damage that could set it back decades? 
Communicating with passion 
Summer of travel chaos: what next?
The strike action levied by staff at the major airlines has had the major benefit of being on the front foot with 
consistent and dramatic messaging. easyJet staff in Spain want the same pay as their European counterparts - 
their strike action will still impact UK consumers as a vast majority of easyJet flights in the summer head to Spain 
daily. Meanwhile, BA's ground staff are striking over their 10% pay cut from the pandemic which has never been 
reinstated, as well as BA's controversial 'fire and rehire policy' which they say is rife. 
GMB has been scathing in the language they have used, accusing the airline of offering 'crumbs' of the money that 
was 'stolen' from hard working employees. Ryanair staff want a 'change of attitude from the airline' alongside 
guarantees of better working conditions, they have also specifically called on the Spanish government to ensure 
Ryanair does not violate labour legislation or staff's constitutional rights. 
Meanwhile, it seems the airlines have struggled to communicate with the same force and passion that their staff 
and union reps have. They have made it clear that they are against strike action and are trying to solve the issues, 
but this is a line that has lost impact as the inevitability of strike action and airport chaos has grown. 
Underlying the strike action is a wider movement created by the pandemic that has seemingly impacted the UK 
transport sector the most. The Great Resignation has created a significant shift in the employee / employer 
relationship that has left employers scrambling to retain and attract talent, not aided by the sector laying off 30,000 
skilled staff at the height of the COVID-19 crisis. 
The jobs market has been overhauled and now employee confidence is at an all-time high. New job openings have 
meant that if employees are unhappy where they work, there may be more options to move elsewhere to gain the 
pay and conditions they might expect. For this reason, employee engagement has never been more important 
within a corporate structure. 
What became clear earlier this year is that this is exactly what employees in the UK transport sector, particularly the 
aviation division, have been doing. Many were lured away by better pay, better conditions, and less stress, not just 
by rival firms but also by completely different sectors all together. The inability to compete against this backdrop has 
created a huge staff shortage not seen in modern times, and training requirements that simply couldn't be met by 
the hectic summer schedule because they couldn't persuade employees to sign on the dotted line. 
Roadmap to stability 
The UK public needs to see decisive visibility from its transport leaders, with the same passion the union reps are 
showing. They need to see communication that shows them that everything is being done to stop more strike action 
and travel upheaval - what is the roadmap out of this? More visibility is needed by the industry's leaders in coming 
forward to reassure the public that they are doing everything they can to find a solution to head off the travel chaos. 
To survive the summer of union action, the different players involved will need to adopt a secure strategy to 
manage losses, maintain productivity, crucially uphold reputation and retain the employer-employee dynamic. 
Reputationally, it's clear now that for the UK's aviation sector things could not be worse. 
The stakes are high, and the onus is on travel leaders to show that they are doing absolutely everything that they 
can to stop this continued disruption throughout 2022 - or they will face severe reputational impact for any 
indecisiveness.

Ryanair's subsidiary Lauda Europe will not be switching to an all Boeing 737 fleet as previously indicated. Instead, 
the airline will extend the Airbus A320 leases for another four years from 2024 to 2028, Ryanair Group's chief 
executive Michael O'Leary said at a conference in Vienna on July 13, 2022, Aviation Week reported.
Ryanair Group is known to operate a uniform fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft. However, the carrier diversified and 
advocated a dual Boeing and Airbus fleet after acquiring the defunct Austrian carrier Lauda in 2018.
Lauda Europe currently operates a total of 29 A320s. The rest of Ryanair Group's subsidiaries operate more than 
480 Boeing 737 aircraft.
Ryanair had been looking at canceling the leases on all of the Airbus A320s operated by Lauda in favor of a Boeing 
fleet in 2020.

Belarus restricts airspace over Minsk, south of the country

Belarusian authorities have restricted airspace over the capital city, Minsk, extending south towards the Ukrainian 
border, and also encompassing the cities of Gomel in the east and Brest in the west.
According to NOTAM O0563/22 issued on July 11, 2022, no commercial transit traffic is allowed in the zone except 
for aircraft arriving at or departing from Minsk National, Brest, and Gomel airports. Military traffic is also allowed. 
The restriction is currently only in place through 2159Z on July 14 (0059L on July 15).
The new restriction is relatively insignificant for commercial traffic as the vast majority of airlines - including all 
European Union carriers - have been avoiding Belarusian airspace since the state-orchestrated hijacking of a 
Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) B737-800 in May 2021. As Ukrainian airspace to the south is closed to all civilian traffic 
due to the ongoing war, there is only a trickle of transit traffic through northern Belarus on west-east routes.
Belarus closed its airspace adjacent to the Ukrainian border from early July 2022 through early October 2022.

GATWICK airport has been crowned the UK's worst airport for flight cancellations, according to fresh data 
published yesterday.
Flights from the south London airport are 10 times more likely to be axed compared with Stansted, according to 
data compiled by intelligence company OAG and shared with Sky News.
Gatwick's cancellations represented 3.2 per cent of the total number of flights cancelled in 2022, compared with 2.3 
per cent for Heathrow, 1.9 per cent for Luton, and 0.3 per cent for Stansted.
Commenting on the figures, a Gatwick spokesperson said the hub regretted any cancellations and disruption to 
passengers, adding that it would gradually increase capacity from 825 daily flights to 850 in August.
"By carefully controlling and gradually increasing the maximum number of flights over time - until the end of August 
- the airport aims to help both its airlines and their ground handling companies improve the service they provide by 
reducing the number of flights they need to manage," the spokesperson said. In terms of airlines, British Airways 
was considered the worst UK airline for flight cancellations, followed by Easyjet. Ryanair has cancelled fewer flights 
than any other major carrier since the beginning of the year, the data showed.
The study comes the day after Heathrow asked airlines to stop selling tickets for the summer period as it capped 
the number of daily passengers at 100,000. The cap, which is set to remain in place until 11 September, was 
slammed by IATA director general Willie Walsh as "ridiculous".
"Heathrow is trying to maximise the profitability that they get from the airport at the expense of airlines," Walsh, a 
former boss of BA's owner IAG, told Reuters yesterday.

The comments reignited a long-standing feud between Heathrow and airlines over airport fees.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) expects $1.5 billion of savings in 2022 as a result of long-term jet fuel supply contracts at lower 
prices, Alliance News reported Wednesday, citing Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary. 
The budget carrier secured its fuel supply until March 2023 at about $73 per barrel, lower than the current prices of 
up to $120 per barrel. The company is also in talks with up to 40 airports to set up new routes as it anticipates to 
transport 200 million passengers annually within a few years, up from 150 million before COVID-19. 
Ryanair shares were down over 2% on Wednesday's close.

A British Airways flight or one from Gatwick airport are where passengers have had their journeys scrapped most 
often this year.
That conclusion comes from an analysis of data from OAG, which receives light intelligence from airlines, 
government agencies and other sources.
Flights from Gatwick are ten times more likely to have been cancelled this year than Stansted, according to an 
analysis of the numbers carried out by Sky News. with 3% of flights from London's second airport scrapped 
compared to 0.3% at its rival.
June was especially poor at Gatwick, said the report, with one in 14 flights cancelled.
British Airways, owned by IAG, meanwhile was the airline most affected, scrapping 3.5% of flights or twelve times 
as many as Ryanair, which has cancelled less than any other major carrier worldwide, according to the OAG.
Michael O' Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said it planned ahead better than rivals, while still being based in the 
EU has allowed it to deal better with the labour shortages that have plagued UK-based carriers since Brexit and the 
easing of Covid restrictions.
John Grant, chief analyst at OAG, told Sky: "When we entered COVID, airlines made a lot of people redundant. 
During that two-year furlough period, those people found jobs elsewhere and have not returned to the industry.

"Of those that have returned, their security policies will have expired. They need to be vetted again and go through 
the same process as they did two years ago."

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has announced its return to Belfast Int'l but has warned a 50% cut of the UK government's 
air passenger duty (APD) on domestic flights was not enough.
Ryanair, in October 2021, had ceased flights from both Belfast airports blaming the cost of operating and the APD, 
a tax levied on air passengers, which varies according to destination and class of travel.
Announcing Ryanair's return to Belfast, Commercial Director Jason McGuinness used the opportunity to call on the 
government to scrap the APD on all flights, adding a 50% cut on domestic flights from April 2023 was "simply 
insufficient".
The rate for UK domestic flights is due to halve to GPP6.50 pounds (USD7.69) from April 2023, while the rate for 
flights of 2,000 to 5,500 miles (3,218km to 8,851km) is set to rise to GBP87 (USD102), and the rate for journeys 
over 5,500 miles (8,851km) is set to rise to GBP91 (USD107).
"Our decision to launch close to 80 weekly domestic flights to/from East-Midlands, Edinburgh, London-Stansted, 
and Manchester demonstrates that lower aviation taxes and competitive airport charges are the catalyst for long-
term traffic growth and increased connectivity. To enable additional investment from Ryanair (and other airlines) 
from next Summer onwards, the UK government must immediately scrap aviation taxes for all flights; otherwise, it 
will put the UK (an island-based economy) at risk of losing air traffic to competing European countries," he stressed.
Ryanair said its Summer 2023 schedule from Belfast would feature 12 international routes and the launch of new 
domestic services. The Irish budget carrier will base two aircraft in Belfast to operate 115 weekly flights, including to 
sun destinations such as Alicante, Girona, and Malaga (Spain), and Faro (Portugal). New UK domestic services 
from Belfast include East Midlands, Edinburgh, London Stansted, and Manchester Int'l.
Belfast International Airport's Chief Financial Officer Dan Owens said the return of Ryanair would increase the 
number of destinations from the airport to more than 70.
Ryanair will go back in the ring with easyJet, which currently holds 79% market share in terms of weekly airline 
seats at Belfast International, according to the ch-aviation capacities module. Other competitors at Belfast include 
Jet2 (United Kingdom), TUI Airways, and Wizz Air.

Ryanair: $1.5bn saved in fuel costs due to long-term supply contracts

Body
European budget airline Ryanair will save around $1.5 billion this year due to long-term jet fuel supply contracts, 
chief executive Michael O'Leary said on Wednesday in Vienna.
The airline will receive the majority of the fuel it needs until March 2023 at a price of roughly $73 per barrel while 
prices have recently risen to up to $120 per barrel.
"We have secured all the fuel we need at much lower prices," O'Leary said.
Ryanair will be able to transport over 200 million passengers annually within a few years, O'Leary said, compared 
to around 150 million before the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Irish company is in talks with around 30 to 40 airports about setting up new routes. O'Leary announced 
connections from Vienna to Helsinki, Copenhagen, and Tuzla for the winter flight plan.
Vienna is among the fastest-growing locations of the Ryanair Group. It employs around 16,000 people overall and 
boasts a fleet of 470 planes.

Heathrow warns of further cancellations Transport Fresh disruption comes as Wizz Air announces reduced

Heathrow warns of further cancellations; Transport Fresh disruption comes 
as Wizz Air announces reduced flight plans

Heathrow warned of more flight cancellations while Wizz Air became the latest carrier to cut its flying plans, 
highlighting how this summer's travel disruption is hitting every part of the industry.
The country's busiest airport said that it would tell airlines to cancel more flights if needed, after admitting the 
service "has not been acceptable" at times this summer.
John Holland-Kaye, chief executive, said: "We have already seen times recently when demand exceeds the 
capacity of the airport, airlines and ground handlers.
"We will review the schedule changes that airlines have submitted in response to the government's requirement to 
minimise disruption for passengers this summer and will ask them to take further action if necessary."
Passengers at Heathrow were also hit by last-minute disruption after the airport told airlines to cancel 61 of the 
roughly 1,100 flights scheduled to operate yesterday.
The airport said: "We are expecting higher passenger numbers in terminals 3 and 5 today than the airport currently 
has capacity to serve."
Heathrow warns of further cancellations Transport Fresh disruption comes as Wizz Air announces reduced 
flight plans
The fresh disruption came as Wizz Air said that it would cut back its flight plans for the peak summer period 5 per 
cent; the measures would "avoid cancellations and secure a more punctual operation".
Airlines in Europe have been forced to cut back their plans for the summer as staffing shortages across the industry 
leave them unable to operate their original schedules. The schedule cuts at Wizz are smaller than those at many 
other airlines. EasyJet has cut back its plans for the current quarter by about 7 per cent while British Airways has 
cancelled 13 per cent of its flights originally scheduled to fly between March and October.
Analysts at Bernstein said that it "makes sense. Wizz is less exposed to the most congested airports where 
problems are greatest".
However, Wizz's main rival Ryanair, which kept its staff during the pandemic, has been barely hit by the disruption. 
Travel disruption, the high price of fuel and the strong dollar combined to push Wizz into a loss at the start of the 
summer season, underlining the challenges facing many airlines even as demand for flying roars back.
The Hungary-based carrier reported an operating loss of (EURO)285mn in the three months to the end of June and 
became one of the first airlines in
Europe to quantify the financial impact of the disruption, which it said had cost (EURO)50mn.
The airline said that it expected stronger demand for air travel to push it into the black in the current quarter despite 
the high oil price and that fewer scheduled flights across the industry would enable it to charge more for tickets and 
fly fuller aircraft.
Wizz Air shares fell 4 per cent yesterday. Its losses for the year are more than 60 per cent.
Reflecting the wave of demand, Heathrow recorded a sixfold year-on-year increase in passenger numbers in June, 
as travellers returned to the skies.
Heathrow yesterday said almost 6mn people travelled through the airport in June, up from 957,000 in the same 
month in 2021 when air passengers were subject to restrictions, but down from the 7.25mn recorded in June 2019 
before the pandemic hit.
It recorded 26mn travellers in the first six months of the year - an almost sevenfold increase on the 3.8mn who used 
the airport in the same period in 2021.
Separately, a committee of politicians yesterday criticised the government for not doing more to strengthen 
consumer protection for flyers.
The House of Commons transport select committee said ministers had not followed enough of the 
recommendations laid out in an April report, including giving the aviation regulator more power.
"Recommendations to provide peace of mind and consumer redress for travellers have been rejected," committee 
chair Huw Merriman said.
The government said it had taken a range of actions to tackle aviation disruption, and said it would publish a 
passenger charter to "ensure passengers know their rights when they fly". See Lex 13% Chunk of BA's March to

Your front page told us boldly that air travellers face years of rising fares, in a warning from Ryanair's Michael 
O'Leary (Report, July 2).
But what about the rising temperatures? As O'Leary suggested it's a matter of sorting fuel and staffing problems 
(plus the Brexit mess). O'Leary also spoke of environmental charges, under which airlines buy traceable credits to 
cover the amount they pollute under parallel emissions systems in the UK and the EU. Under pressure to achieve 
net zero by 2050, all major global polluters are worried about stranded assets but no amount of carbon credits will 
allow for business as usual, with just a bit of a price hike.
O'Leary should be the first to acknowledge you can't run an airline without checking the weather - looking out the 
window in other words. He should come clean about the long-term future of air travel, and admit that the window to 
stop climate disaster is getting smaller and hotter by the day.
It's not a matter of abandoning but prioritising our investments and technology, deciding who and what really needs 
to fly, and accepting, however costly, that flying is only justified if it really is environmentally sound.
Otherwise it's to hell in a handcart for us all. Not much of a holiday option. Barbara Mullarney London W3, UK

Travel disruption exposes EASYJET's operating model; Airlines. Staffing

As the first signs of travel disruption emerged in the spring, easyJet's chief executive was relishing a new challenge 
after two miserable years of border restrictions because of a pandemic that had plunged the industry into crisis.
Johan Lundgren said in late March: "It is a good challenge to have. It is customers coming back. We are putting 
pressure on the system, the airports, the ground handlers, the air traffic controllers, because customers are coming 
back ... That is good."
Three months on, and he may rue that comment. Returning passengers have overwhelmed the European system, 
with easyJet one of the worst-hit airlines in a barrage of disruption caused by staff shortages across every part of 
the sector.
This week the chaos took its first big casualty, with the company's chief operating officer Peter Bellew resigning 
after a difficult run. The airline has cancelled 1,760 flights departing from the UK this year, five times the number 
over the same period in 2019, according to data provider Cirium.
"It has been an operational disaster at easyJet," said Chris Tarry of Ctaira, an aviation consultancy.
Travel disruption exposes EASYJET 's operating model Airlines. Staffing crisis Reliance on airports with little 
slack, such as Gatwick, takes heavy toll on carr....
The disruption would cost the airline about (EURO)200mn, according to Bernstein analysts, pushing it into a loss 
this financial year, which ends in September. Its shares have suffered, down 40 per cent to 11-year lows since the 
start of January, outpacing the declines of rivals.
Although not the only airline facing difficulties, with British Airways, Lufthansa and KLM cancelling tens of 
thousands of flights between them this summer, easyJet's operating model is at the heart of its problems, leaving it 
helplessly exposed to the industry-wide disruption.
Like rivals Ryanair and Wizz Air, it has a low-cost business built on fine margins that rely on swiftly turning round 
flights, which are vulnerable to any delays or disruption at the airport.
But unlike its two rivals, easyJet has based its operations on a handful of capacity-constrained airports, notably 
Gatwick, that have been hit by staff shortages and have little slack in their busy schedules to cope with disruption.
"From the design of the business, it is in the worst place on both fronts ... They are in the wrong place for the 
present environment," said Andrew Lobbenberg, an aviation analyst at HSBC.
It was one of airlines to suffer the most in a chaotic late May and early June, which came to a head during the UK 
school half-term break, with passengers facing cancellations, huge queues and hours-long delays at airports.
The disruption prompted a rethink as easyJet management realised they needed greater buffers in their schedules, 
particularly more standby crew for when delays pushed staff beyond their permitted working hours.
With airports overwhelmed, executives concluded that they had overestimated how many people they could fly this 
summer, and later in June announced plans to cut back schedules to try to stop last-minute cancellations.
EasyJet was cautious in restarting flying - its planes were grounded for 11 weeks in 2020 - leaving it with a 
challenge as the industry suddenly switched from hibernation to full throttle in a matter of weeks.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said his airline had experienced much less disruption from its London hub, 
the smaller Stansted, because his team worked "hand in glove" with the airport to gear up for the restart.
"At Heathrow and Gatwick it is much more difficult because easyJet and British Airways were not sure what they 
were going to do," he said.
With plans to fly slightly fewer flights than 2019 but with roughly the same number of staff, easyJet management 
blames its problems on high sickness rates among their workers as well as labour shortages across nearly every 
part of the industry, from ground handlers to air traffic controllers.
Boss Lundgren also blames the government for immigration rules that have made it harder to hire EU workers, on 
top of delays in getting new staff security clearances.
But some say easyJet should have been more alert to potential disruption.
Tarry said the airline was ultimately responsible for planning its summer schedule, and chose to run more flights 
than it could handle. "They decided to offer, then sell, far too many seats."
Bellew's departure has unnerved investors - shares fell 5 per cent after he quit - as the former Ryanair executive 
had been well-regarded by investors for his role in cutting costs in the pandemic.
It has focused attention on Lundgren's position. It was "not professional" to lose an operations boss during the 
middle of your busiest period, one industry figure said.
But people close to the airline's board say Lundgren has the backing of chair Stephen Hester, the City veteran with 
a history of overseeing struggling groups, who took the job last autumn. The board was not seeing significant 
unease among investors, the people say.
Travel disruption exposes EASYJET 's operating model Airlines. Staffing crisis Reliance on airports with little 
slack, such as Gatwick, takes heavy toll on carr....
Yet, other industry figures, outside the company, are less sure. "Johan needs a win soon," one person said.
Adding pressure on Lundgren and the board are souring industrial relations.
Strikes loom in Spain this month, while British pilots' union Balpa accused the airline of "corporate bullying" over 
treatment of staff and absences during the pandemic, which the company fiercely denies. A French pilots' union has 
fired a broadside at the airline's management over summer planning.
Much will rest on how easyJet handles the rest of this summer.
For now, there are signs the cuts to schedules have worked, with far fewer last-minute cancellations.
Investors will hope it means the airline has got to grips with its problems as it aims to keep costs low and move past 
the worst of the pandemic to restore profits, with HSBC's Lobbenberg summing up the task: "The fastest way to 
reduce costs is to stabilise your operations."

Passengers endure check-in chaos and cancellations. Yet the aviation industry insists it is on course for recovery.
Rolls-Royce has flagged an uptick in demand for new large aircraft. Willie Walsh, boss of industry body Iata, has 
forecast a return to industry-wide profitability next year. It is, he claims, a time for optimism.
That message has not been lost on workers, including those at IAG - which Walsh ran until recently. At its British 
Airways subsidiary, unions have secured a "vastly improved" pay deal, averting a strike by check-in staff.
Across the industry, Iata expects a 7.9 per cent rise in the wage bill this year.
This is nearly twice the forecast 4.3 per cent increase in job numbers. Fuel costs are an even bigger headache.
Assuming the price of Brent crude averages $101 per barrel this year, Iata calculates fuel will account for about a 
quarter of the industry's costs, up from 19 per cent in 2021.
Hedging softens the blow. Ryanair, for instance, locked in an equivalent price of $65 per barrel for most of this 
year's fuel needs. It has been a resilient performer, with low costs and a strong balance sheet. Its shares - trading in 
line with their historic average on a price/earnings multiple of 12 - are down 5 per cent since February 24. That is a 
quarter the decline of the S&P Global 1200 airlines index.
But in the medium term, even discounter Ryanair expects higher oil prices, together with environmental charges, to 
push up average fares up by at least a quarter to (EURO)50. Confidence about passengers' willingness to prioritise 
Airline industry: the long haul
holidays if they have to tighten their belts must wither. They have done so in past recessions, but that was against a 
backdrop of declining real air travel costs.
As airport queues demonstrate, the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions has unleashed pent-up demand. But that could 
soon peter out in harsh economic conditions. So, too, could hopes of a rapid return to profitability.

Wizz Air Malta (Malta Int'l) will complement rather than replace the Hungarian Air Operator's Certificate of Wizz Air, 
its president, Robert Carey, told the German aviation news website Aviation.Direct.
Carey did not discuss the network plans for the new unit and said only that it was being set up to "diversify" the 
Wizz Air Holdings structure.
The holding plans to obtain an AOC issued by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and an 
Operating Licence issued by the Malta Civil Aviation Directorate (CAD). The new carrier plans to launch operations 
in October 2022 using Maltese-registered aircraft, although the holding did not reveal how many of its A320 Family 
twinjets it will transfer.
Wizz Air Holdings also has a unit in the UK with a local AOC, Wizz Air UK, and another in the United Arab Emirates, 
Wizz Air Abu Dhabi.
Once certified in Malta, the LCC will join its rival Ryanair, which maintains two Maltese AOCs: Malta Air and Lauda 
Europe.
