             PlaneStation Group plc ('PlaneStation' or 'the Group')
             PLANESTATION GROUP BUYS 30% STAKE IN EU-JETOPS LIMITED
PlaneStation Group plc, the airport and property company, has invested GBP2
million in cash for a 30 per cent shareholding in EU-JetOps Ltd ('EUjet'), the
Irish-based airline. The purchase follows the announcement in February that
EUjet would become the first provider of scheduled flights from PlaneStation's
Kent International Airport - Manston ('Kent International'). As part of the
agreement, PlaneStation will have the right to appoint a representative to the
Board of EUjet.
EUjet, headed by former Ryanair CEO PJ McGoldrick, has estimated that 500,000
passengers will use Kent International during the first year of operation, which
is forecast to grow to approximately two million passengers by the end of the
airport's third year of operation. The growth will be sustained by offering cost
Planestation Group Acquisition
effective flights to 21 European destinations in the first year.
EUjet will be operating a fleet of seven Fokker 100 aircraft and is currently
negotiating arrangements with other airports intended to form part of the EUjet
route structure. EUjet will appoint Ronald Haylock as Chairman, who has taken a
minority share in the company.
PlaneStation CEO Martin May said: "I believe that this investment represents an
important step forward both for PlaneStation and Kent International. It gives
the Group a substantial stake in a new entrant to the low-cost airline sector
but more importantly gives both Kent International and EUjet a platform to
enable them both to develop their businesses."
Kent International now has all the components essential for a developing
airport, namely a strong catchment area, a solid infrastructure and an anchor
airline providing a broad range of new routes to business and holiday
destinations throughout Europe. With a growing number of air travellers we
believe that Kent International, as well as serving the Kent market, is ideally
positioned to absorb the overspill of passengers from other London airports, and
generate strong ongoing revenues. We are looking forward to working with PJ
McGoldrick and his team as EUjet develops its scheduled services business."
PlaneStation and EUjet are holding a Press Conference on the 20th of May at 9:
30am at County Hall, Maidstone, Kent, where the plans for Kent International
Airport -Manston will be outlined.

                 BRITISH AIRWAYS STILL 'RIPPING OFF' CONSUMERS
Ryanair Europe's largest low fares airline today (Friday, 14th May 2004) laughed
at British Airways latest hopeless attempt to win back European passengers, with
an alleged 30% off fare promotion - ONLY available from one specific airport, on
very selected routes, with travel strictly off peak, with very stringent terms
and conditions, booked 28 days in advance, etc., etc . . . . .
Speaking this morning following BA's failed attempt to win back passengers,
Ryanair's Deputy Chief Executive and Commercial Director, Michael Cawley, said:
        "For years British Airways have been ripping off consumers with their
         high fares and if this is their latest attempt to win back customers, it
         is laughable! This is the same airline whose first instinct earlier in
         the week was to gouge passengers yet again by introducing a totally
         unnecessary fuel surcharge and smacking GBP5.00 on top of all its return
         fares. Now they are running scared and pathetically trying to win back
         European passengers, by announcing a 30% off fare promotion on fares
         that are already more than five times more expensive than Ryanairs!
         (BA = GBP175* / Ryanair = GBP31*)
Ryanair Holdings PLC British Airways Fares
        "Passengers all over the UK and Europe are travelling in their millions
         with Ryanair. Ryanair is Britain's favourite airline and we carry more
         shorthaul passengers to and from Britain than any other airline,
         including British Airways. Passengers know that Ryanair's air fares
         (even with BA's alleged 30% discount) are still three times cheaper than
         BAs. European consumers also know that Ryanair's unbeatable air fares
         and customer service are available seven days a week across our entire
         route network to 150 destinations in 16 countries, and not just from one
         airport, during off peak times like BA.
        "We know it, British Airways knows it and European consumers know it -
         British Airways are still a bunch of Gougers!"
= Based on the last published year-end figures for both companies (March 2003).

BAA announces 15% growth in April 2004 passenger traffic
BAA's seven UK airports handled 11.4 million passengers in April, an increase
of 15% compared to April 2003. The result continues an underlying trend of
steady improvement in passenger numbers.
Among the key markets, the highest growth was recorded on routes most affected
last year by SARS and the Iraq War. North Atlantic traffic increased 18.6%
while other long haul recorded an increase of 27.5%. On European scheduled
routes, low cost airlines drove growth of 19.4%, but this increase compares
with April 2003 when Buzz services were temporarily suspended prior to its
acquisition by Ryanair. Domestic routes rose 6.5%, while European charter
traffic remained weak, showing a 3.4% decrease.
Heathrow delivered strong recovery against the previous year recording an
increase of 14.9%, taking the airport's twelve month total close to 65 million
for the first time. Elsewhere traffic at Stansted grew by 33.9%, Gatwick by
8.4%, Southampton by 36.3% and at BAA's Scottish airports by 7.9%.
The number of air transport movements rose 8.1% during the month and there was

a further acceleration in the rate of growth in cargo activity, with tonnage
rising 6.9%.

Ryanair today (Tuesday, 11th May 2004) guaranteed that there would be no fuel
surcharges or price rises for Ryanair passengers this year.
Speaking this afternoon, as British Airways and Qantas became the first of the
high fare carriers to introduce fuel surcharges, Ryanair Chief Executive,
Michael O'Leary, said:
        "As usual, the first instinct of BA and other high fare airlines is to
         gouge passengers. It is unfair that passengers who have already bought
         and paid for tickets should now have to pay surcharges, after all
         British Airways didn't offer these passengers refunds when fuel prices
         were falling over the past 5 years.
        "At Ryanair, we believe that the low fare you pay is all you should pay,
         and we guarantee that every passenger who books their summer holiday
         with Ryanair can do so free of any price rises or fuel surcharges.
         "At Ryanair, we believe in Low Prices - Today, Tomorrow and Forever.
         British Airways are just a bunch of Gougers!".

        RYANAIR OPENS GBP10 MILLION GLASGOW PRESTWICK MAINTENANCE FACILITY
                      UP TO 200 NEW JOBS FOR AYRSHIRE REGION
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline,today (Monday, 10th May 2004) welcomed
Secretary of State for Transport, The Rt. Hon. Alistair Darling MP to the
official opening of Ryanair's new GBP10 million maintenance facility at Glasgow
Prestwick International Airport. The 4,000 square metres facility, which has
been developed in partnership with The Scottish Executive, is Ryanair's major
aircraft service centre outside Ireland, and will employ up to 200 people over
the next 5 years.
Ryanair Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary and Secretary of State, Mr Darling M.P.
performed the official opening ceremony today at Glasgow Prestwick International
Airport.
Speaking today, Michael O'Leary said:
        "We are delighted that The Secretary of State for Transport and Scotland
Ryanair Holdings PLC Prestwick Hangar opening
         could join us today to mark the official opening of this new 4,000
         square metre maintenance facility at Glasgow Prestwick. Ryanair's 10
         year history in Scotland and ongoing commitment to the further growth
         and development of Glasgow Prestwick International Airport is further
         demonstrated today with the opening of this new maintenance facility and
         the creation of close to 200 jobs for the local economy.
        "Our expansion in Scotland is the result of our on-going partnership
         with the Scottish Executive and Scottish Enterprise, who have shared our
         vision of more low cost flights to/from Scotland and the kind of growth
         in Scotland that has resulted in the creation of 200 more jobs here
         today.
        "Unfortunately this GBP10 million investment by Ryanair, creating up to
         200 jobs is already being highjacked by the "Longshanks" of Ayrshire
         Council, who have come up with a ludicrous rate demand of GBP111,000 -
         unlike other UK regions which were offering rate holidays for 10 years.
         Ryanair will halt all further job creation at this facility until this
         highway robbery is reversed".

                    RYANAIR STAFF TO RECEIVE 3% PAY INCREASE
Ryanair today (Thursday, 6th May 2004) confirmed to its staff that it would
proceed with a 3% pay increase effective 1 April 2004. This increase, which
would equate to up to EUR2,000 extra per annum of the basic pay of pilots, will be
implemented in the May payroll and will be backdated to 1 April.
Ryanair was quick to clarify that this pay increase was not any indication of
better times ahead, but rather an appropriate reward for the continued
productivity gains delivered by its people. Ryanair was the first airline in
Europe back in January to warn of a pessimistic outlook for fares and yields and
the airline continues to see no change in these very competitive market
conditions. Ryanair is continuing to expand rapidly, opening new routes, driving
down fares and winning market share from all its competitors.
Traffic figures to be released later today for April will confirm Ryanair's
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3% pay increase to staff
continuing strong growth, but in a very demanding yield environment.
Confirming these pay increases today Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary
said:
    "Even in difficult times it remains our priority to reward our staff first,
     with better pay and conditions than our competitors. Whilst we expect the
     coming year to be tough and the Winter to be particularly difficult, this
     pay increase at this time is both a vote of thanks and a demonstration of
     our confidence in our people who will continue to drive efficiency and
     continue to widen the substantial cost and price advantage Ryanair has over
     all other airlines in Europe.
    "As history has repeatedly shown that during price wars, the lowest cost
     operator wins. In the European airline business lowest cost - by a distance
     - is Ryanair. We will continue to use this cost advantage to offer lower
     fares and take more share from both the high fare and not so high fare
     airlines of Europe".

April Traffic Figures
The number of flights handled by National Air Traffic Services last month
increased by 7.8 per cent to 173,558 from 160,951 in April 2003, the UK's
leading air traffic control provider reported today.
All areas of NATS' business showed strong increases in April, with domestic
flights up 4.7 per cent, international arrival/departures up 8.7 per cent and
overflights up 9.2 per cent
However, some of the year-on-year gains are misleading. Figures for April 2003
reflected the start of the war in Iraq, and the grounding of the Buzz fleet
following its take-over by Ryanair.

                          RYANAIR'S LOW FARE SERVICES
                          AT BRUSSELS CHARLEROI AIRPORT
                                   TO CONTINUE
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Tuesday, 13th April 2004)
confirmed that it had concluded an agreement with Brussels Charleroi Airport and
the Walloon Authorities which will allow Ryanair's low fares base at Brussels
Charleroi Airport to continue with no change to the cost base, which means that
all of the eleven existing low fare routes served from Brussels Charleroi will
continue.
The agreement concluded between Ryanair, Brussels Charleroi Airport and the
Walloon Authorities contained the following principal elements:
   The existing airport and handling charges will continue for the
     foreseeable future until the airport reaches 2 million passengers per annum
     at which time 3rd party competitive handling will be introduced.
   Legislation will be enacted by the Walloon Authorities in order to make
     the Ryanair discounted arrangements available to other airlines operating at
Ryanair Holdings PLC Charleroi Announcement
     Brussels Charleroi Airport.
   Ryanair have agreed to actively explore possibilities for basing more
     aircraft at, and opening new routes from, Brussels Charleroi Airport,
     subject to a new terminal being constructed, and the airport providing a
     competitive cost offer for these new routes which would be similar to the
     other lower costoffers presently available from a number of other privately
     and publicly owned airports.
Welcoming the announcement of this agreement Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael
O'Leary, said:
       "We welcome this agreement which is good news for consumers and removes
        uncertainty and allows our low fare services to continue at Brussels
        Charleroi. This agreement was timely as we have negotiated a number of
        other airport base arrangements in recent months at costs which are
        lowerthan that at Brussels Charleroi, and there was a real likelihood
        that in the absence of an early agreement with Brussels Charleroi we
        would have closed the base and moved the aircraft and the low fare
        routes elsewhere.
       "These lower cost alternatives again highlight the flaw in the recent
         European Commission decision on the cost base at Brussels Charleroi. The
         entire basis of the Commission's flawed decision was that no private
         airport would enter such an arrangement. We have repeatedly confirmed
         that we had other lower costarrangements at the time, and that other
         airports continue to offer us lower costalternatives today because they
         want to share in the enormous traffic, growth and commercial profits
         that Ryanair's low fare services deliver. The Brussels Charleroi cost
         base passes the private investor principle, and when Ryanair appeals the
         decision to the European Court of First Instance (in early May), this
         principle will form the core of our appeal.
       "However, the good news today for Belgian consumers/visitors is that
        thanks to this agreement between Ryanair, Brussels Charleroi Airport and
        the Walloon Authorities, our low fare routes will continue from Brussels
        Charleroi and we look forward to carrying millions of passengers each
        year and saving them over EUR1.5 billion euros annually over the high fare
        alternatives being offered by the rip-off airlines at Brussels Zaventem
        Airport. The present merger negotiations between the two high fares
        airlines, SN Brussels and Virgin Express, show just how badly the
        Belgian market needs Ryanair in Brussels Charleroi since we provide
        competition, choice and low fare air travel for ordinary consumers".

("TBI" or "the Group")
Pre-Close Trading Update and Quarterly Traffic Statistics
The Board of TBI confirms that trading for the second half of the year has been
in line with expectations as low-cost travel to domestic and European
destinations continues to grow.
During the six months to 31 March 2004, the Group has continued to attract
additional low-cost traffic. In November 2003 London Luton Airport ("Luton")
became the first destination to be served out of easyJet's new Schonefeld base
in Berlin, followed in February 2004 by the announcement of a new route to
Budapest International. In addition, the Group awarded the mandate to manage
its car park operations at Luton, together with the bus shuttle service between
Luton Airport Parkway railway station and the terminal at Luton, to NCP. The
TBI PLC Pre Close Trading Update
five year contract commenced 1 April 2004.
Looking ahead, WIZZ Air will commence a new route to Katowice in Poland in May
and easyJet will begin services to Dortmund in September, both of which will be
served out of Luton.
Elsewhere, Belfast, Cardiff and Skavsta have all continued to benefit from
growth in low-cost activity. In March, easyJet announced the further expansion
of its operations out of Belfast International (BIA) with the launch of new
direct scheduled services to four key European destinations in France and Spain,
plus an additional daily London Gatwick service, bringing the total destinations
served by easyJet from BIA to 13. This comes on top of the announcement by Jet2
of two new services to be commenced to Prague and Brussels. BIA continues to
work closely with both Air Route Development (NI) Ltd and easyJet and we look
forward to announcing further major developments in the near future.
At Skavsta, work on the new terminal building has been completed with full
commercial operation scheduled to begin later this month. Traffic continues to
grow rapidly at Skavsta underpinned by Ryanair's base operation at this
location, which was bolstered in January with the addition of two new daily
routes to Rome and Milan. Cardiff continues to benefit from the success of
bmibaby.
Outside Europe, Orlando Sanford continues to see a recovery in domestic traffic
which will be further boosted this month when Vacation Express returns its
Caribbean hub operations to this airport. Under the seven year agreement,
flights will operate three days a week to 11 Caribbean destinations.
TBI's Preliminary Results for the year ended 31 March 2004 will be announced on
10 June 2004.

Note to Editors:
TBI's European airports comprise: London Luton, Belfast International, Cardiff
International and Stockholm-Skavsta
Percentage changes shown are comparisons with the same period in 2003
TBI's four European airports handled a total of 3 million passengers during the
period from 1 January to 31 March 2004, an increase of 13.2% over the
corresponding period last year (2003: 2.6 million). For the six months to
March, passenger numbers rose by 15% to 6.1 million.
Once again, low-cost traffic continued to drive growth across the portfolio
increasing by 17% to 2.5 million passengers, while full service fell 19% and
charter increased 13%.
The growth in low-cost was principally driven out of Cardiff and Skavsta, which
increased passenger numbers by 28% and 215% respectively as a result of the
growth in operations by bmibaby (Cardiff) and Ryanair (Skavsta).

        "Today's announcement of our new daily service linking Dublin with Reus
         (Salou) on the Spanish Costa Dorada is more great news for Irish
         consumers. Thanks to Ryanair, it has never been cheaper or easier to hit
         the hot spots like Salou on the Costa Dorada, or a treat for the kids to
         the famous "Universal Mediterranea" theme park.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Launch of new route IRE- SPAIN
        "Nobody can match Ryanair's low fares, and Irish consumers can grab a
         seat to the sun from an incredible EUR29.99!, representing savings of
         EUR190.00* on Aer Lingus' high fares to Barcelona. At these fantastic low

                RYANAIR LEAVES EASYJET WAY BEHIND ON PUNCTUALITY
                         (JUST LIKE EVERY WEEK OF 2003!)
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (Friday, 19th March 2004)
published its on-time performance comparisons against Easyjet for January and
February 2004.
Ryanair easily beat Easyjet in the punctuality stakes for 52 weeks in a row in
2003, and again for the first 9 weeks of 2004 - Ryanair leaves Easyjet way
behind.
Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
        "Punctuality of our flights is a top priority" claims Easyjet* - what a
         joke! Ryanair's punctuality has beaten Easyjet's every week of 2003 and
         every week of 2004 so far. It seems that Easyjet are always late when
         compared to Ryanair.
        "So if you want to save time and money then fly Ryanair and avoid the
         often delayed Easyjet.
        "Easyjet can't match Ryanair's low fares, and can't match Ryanair's
         on-time performance either!"

conditions.
Passengers wishing to change the name or date of travel up to twelve hours prior

charge of GBP15/EUR22 per flight sector and per person.
Speaking this morning, Conal Henry, Commercial Director of Ryanair.com, said:
        "This is the latest initiative from Ryanair in our continuous efforts to
         improve our customer service for our passengers - initiatives such as
Ryanair Holdings PLC New on-line change facility
         these have helped grow our European passenger numbers by 50% over the
         last year.
        "If for some reason you can no longer fulfill that shopping commitment
         in London or that weekend in Paris, you can relax in the knowledge that
         Ryanair has introduced an on-line change service which will accommodate
         on-line date and name changes up to 12 hours prior to scheduled
         departure.

         the lowest available fare for the new booking at the time, passengers
         will be obliged to pay this difference. If the available fare is lower
         on the new flight, no refund will be made.

 26 February 2004 
                      RYANAIR TO CLOSE BRUSSELS-LONDON ROUTE 
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today (26th February 04) published its 
 Summer schedule at Brussels Charleroi Airport and confirmed that it was 
 terminating its Brussels-London route with effect from 29 April next. The 
 current Charleroi-London route operates with up to 8 daily flights, carries over 
 360,000 passengers annually, with these customers saving over EUR3m per annum 
 compared to the higher fare alternatives from Zaventem. 
 Ryanair confirmed that this 10% reduction in daily flights at Charleroi was the 
 first element of its response to the European Commission's recent decision to 
 increase costs at Charleroi and require that Ryanair's passengers should pay 
 higher fares. Ryanair will appeal this decision to the European Court in 
 Luxembourg, but while this appeal is underway, there will be reductions in 
 flights and services at Brussels Charleroi, as aircraft capacity is reallocated 
 to other lower cost airports. 
 Announcing these cutbacks today, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary 
 said; 
     "These capacity reductions are bad news for customers at Brussels Charleroi, 
     but good news for other lower cost airports. As the Brussels-London route 
     had the lowest fares, this route cannot be sustained if costs are to be 
     increased as a result of the Commission's decision to increase ticket prices 
     by EUR6 to EUR8 per ticket. These flights will now operate on lower cost routes 
     between private airports such as London Stansted, Glasgow Prestwick, 
     Stockholm Skavsta and London Luton. 
     "Ryanair will shortly be meeting with Brussels Charleroi Airport and the 
     Walloon authorities to agree a way forward. If these talks result in a new 
     agreement with a similar low cost base as before then Ryanair's low fares 
     will continue at Charleroi. However if costs are increased, or the Walloon 
     Authorities do not share our vision for the lowest possible air fares for 
     ordinary people then there will be further flight reductions and route 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Brussels-London route toclose
     closures, as aircraft are sent to other airports where the cost base is 
     already significantly lowerthan Ryanair's original costs at Charleroi 
     Airport.

 arrangement which resulted in Ryanair making Stansted Airport its UK hub. I 
 foresee a similar opportunity at Kent International Airport Manston and I am 
 confident that the agreement signed today will be the basis on which a bright 
 future will be built for both Kent International Airport Manston and EUjet."

                 UPDATE ON EUROPEAN COMMISSION DECISION 
                    ON BRUSSELS-CHARLEROI COST BASE 
 Ryanair anticipates that the European Commissions report on the 
 Brussels-Charleroi cost base will be published in a number of weeks. Thereafter, 
 the government of Belgium will have 60 days to respond to it with its proposals 
 for compliance with the decision. It is therefore likely to be a number of 
 months before the Company can assess the impact of this decision on its cost 
 base at Charleroi. However, in the meantime this decision will be appealed to 
 the European Court of Justice and the Company is confident of overturning the 
 decision on appeal.

  RYANAIR WELCOMES THE PUBLICATION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S DECISION ON THE 
                           BRUSSELS CHARLEROI COST BASE 
 Ryanair today (3rd February'04) welcomed the publication of the decision of the 
 European Commission as it now means that the industry can at least focus on the 
 issues instead of rumours and leaks from the Commission. 
    This decision confirms that the European Commission intends to increase 
     costs and air fares for consumers. 
    The result of this decision is that the European Commission will prevent 
     publicly owned airports competing with privately owned airports. 
    The decision is an attack on all low fare airlines and publicly owned 
     airports and will equally affect Easyjet at Berlin Schonefeld, Toulouse and 
     Marseille, Lufthansa at Leipzig and Munich, Flybe at Perpignan, Bergerac and 
     La Rochelle for example. 
    It is regrettable that the Commission is placing the complains of high 
     cost airports ad high fares airlines above the interests of ordinary 
     consumers who want lower fares. 
    The Commission has now confirmed that publicly owned airports can no 
     longer compete with privately owned airports, and this decision is 
     anticompetitive, anti consumer, will increase costs which will in turn 
     increase air fares. 
 Michael O'Leary, Chief Executive Officer of Ryanair said today in Brussels: 
 "It is impossible to envisage the Commission limiting the discounts or marketing 
 support that Tesco, Carrefour, Aldi or Lidl negotiate in order to lower prices 
 for consumers. It is impossible to envisage the Commission preventing McDonalds 
 negotiating discounts from its suppliers in order to lower the cost of its meals 
 to consumers. 
 "This decision will be appealed to the European Court. We believe the appeal 
 will be supported by many other low fares airlines, regional airports and 
 consumer groups. The European Commission should not be interfering in the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Welcoming of EU Decision
 operation of a free market. Charleroi airport was empty 5 years ago. If this 
 ruling applied back then it would still be an empty airport today. Underused 
 secondary and regional airports must discount to attract low fares customers. 
 Both Brussels Charleroi and Ryanair are profitable at these discounted rates, 
 and 2.5 million consumers annually now fly to /from Brussels Charleroi at the 
 lowest fares in Europe thanks to these discounted routes. 
 "The only beneficiaries of this decision is the original Complainant, Brussels 
 Zaventem Airport and the high fare carriers who fly there. They will now face 
 reduced competition, and higher fares at Brussels Charleroi, thanks to the 
 failure of the EU Commission to promote competition, lower fares and consumer 
 interests." 
 Ends.

                     RYANAIR COMPANY STATEMENT FOLLOWING THE 
           "OFF THE RECORD" PRESS CONFERENCE HELD BY THE EU COMMISSION 
             ON THE CHARLEROI CASE IN ADVANCE OF TOMORROW'S DECISION 
 In response to media questions following an unprecedented "OFF-THE-RECORD" press 
 conference held by the EU Commission this morning (Monday, 2nd February 2004) on 
 the Charleroi case - the day before the full Commission is due to take a vote- a 
 Ryanair Spokesman said: 
         "In an unprecedented move this morning, the EU Commission's Transport 
         Directorate gave Irish journalists specific details on the Commission's 
         decision in the Charleroi case in advance of the full Commission's vote 
         on the decision tomorrow morning. This will have a seriously prejudicial 
         affect on the Commission's vote tomorrow. 
         "This "off-the-record" press conference shows that the Commission is 
         aware of the negative impact of this decision on European consumers and 
         the development of the low fares airlines at underutilised regional 
         airports throughout Europe. Otherwise, they wouldn't be going to such 
         lengths to privately brief and leak details out before the full 
         Commission has had the opportunity to review the facts and consider the 
         wider implications of this case. 
         "Despite DG Transport's best efforts, the industry and consumers are now 
         waking up to the fact that this decision will lead to higher airport 
         costs and therefore higher airfares. The only ones that will benefit 
         from this decision are the high fares airlines and high cost airports. 
         "Strong objections to the proposed decision have already been made by 
         the Forum of European Regional Airports, the Assembly of European 
         Regions, ELFAA and this afternoon, the President of the European 
         Parliament Pat Cox  all of whom raise serious concerns 
         over the wider implications for Europe of this negative decision. 
         "The Commission's proposed decision will reverse 20 years of 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Company Statement
         competition, deregulation and low fares air travel and consumers will 
         suffer with higher fares, less competition and less choice".

     CHICAGO, Jan. 29 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) 
 reported net income of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter, or $1.37 per 
 share, on revenues of $13.2 billion.  Reported net income for 2003 totaled 
 $0.7 billion, or $0.86 per share, on revenues of $50.5 billion.  The results 
 include a $1.01 per share non-cash charge to revalue goodwill balances in the 
 first quarter and a $0.87 per share gain related to a federal tax refund in 
 the fourth quarter. 
     "This past year was notable both for the solid performance turned in by 
 most of our businesses, as well as the challenges we faced," Boeing President 
 and CEO Harry Stonecipher said. "Integrated Defense Systems delivered strong 
 fourth-quarter operating performance and over $50 billion of new orders for 
 the year, which strengthen our revenue outlook going forward. Despite the most 
 severe market challenges our industry has faced, Boeing Commercial Airplanes 
 continues to perform well in terms of productivity and profitability. With the 
 Board's approval to begin selling the 7E7, we are well positioned as the 
 industry recovers with an airplane we believe will provide significant 
 benefits to airlines and passengers," he added. 
     "While there is no doubt that the emergence of ethical issues during the 
 year was deeply disappointing to all of us, I feel strongly that we acted 
 quickly and aggressively to address the issues," Stonecipher said. "As we move 
 into 2004, our focus is on execution, demonstrating our commitment to 
 integrity, and raising our performance to a new level." 
     The Company's 2003 earnings from operations of $0.4 billion reflect lower 
 commercial airplane deliveries, commercial space charges, lower pension 
 income, and the revaluation of commercial financing and goodwill assets (see 
 Table 2).  These factors were partially offset by continued growth and strong 
 operating performance in the Company's portfolio of defense businesses and by 
 continued improvements in operating efficiencies at Commercial Airplanes. 
 Excluding the goodwill impairment charges reported earlier in the year, 
 adjusted earnings from operations* were $1.3 billion for 2003.

     (1) See SEC filings, including Boeing press releases dated April 10, 2003, 
         and April 23, 2003, for additional information. 
     (2) Upon adopting SFAS 142 in the first quarter of 2002, The Company 
         recorded a transitional goodwill impairment charge of $2.4 billion, 
         $1.8 billion net of tax, presented as a cumulative-effect-of- 
         accounting change.  This charge did not impact 1Q02 reported earnings 
         from operations 
     Pre-tax expense for share-based plans totaled $108 million in the fourth 
 quarter and $456 million for 2003 reducing earnings per share by $0.08 and 
 $0.36, respectively.  These expenses are non-cash and are attributable to the 
 Company's equity compensation plans.  Deferred stock compensation expense 
 attributable to vested and undistributed performance shares, which is 
 separately determined based on the quarterly change in the Company's stock 
 price, reduced fourth quarter earnings per share by $0.04 as the Company's 
 stock price rose in the period.   For the year, deferred stock compensation 
 expense reduced earnings per share by $0.05 as the Company's stock price 
 increased almost 28 percent. 
     Cash flow remained strong as the Company generated $3.6 billion and $3.9 
 billion of operating cash flow for the fourth quarter and the full year, 
 respectively.  Discretionary cash contributions to the Company's pension plans 
 reduced operating cash flow for 2003 by $1.7 billion, but were partially 
 offset by a $1.1 billion dollar tax refund received in the fourth quarter.  As 
 shown in Table 3, free cash flow* for the year, measured after investments in 
 property, plant, and equipment, also remained solid at $3.2 billion. 
 Excluding the impact of the tax refund, free cash flow* in the fourth quarter 
 was $2.3 billion.

     Free Cash Flow*                    $3,386     $855    $3,157   $3,235 
     (1) Includes full-year pension contributions totaling $0.3 billion in 2002 
         and $1.7 billion in 2003.  Includes $1.1 billion in tax refund in 
         fourth quarter of 2003. 
     (2) 2003 operating cash flow includes $1.7 billion of inter-company cash 
         received from the sale of aircraft by Commercial Airplanes for 
         customers who receive financing from BCC compared to $2.7 billion in 
         2002.  4Q03 operating cash flow includes $0.3 billion of cash received 
         from these transactions compared to $0.5 billion in 4Q02. 
         2002 operating cash flow reflects previously disclosed 
         reclassification of certain cash flows into investing activities. 
     The Company's cash balance at year end totaled $4.6 billion, up 
 substantially from $1.7 billion at the end of the third quarter and $2.3 
 billion at the end of 2002 (see Table 4).  Excluding BCC and non-recourse 
 debt, the Company's debt increased slightly in 2003 to $4.7 billion after a 
 successful debt refinancing early in the year.  Debt at Boeing Capital 
 decreased by approximately $300 million as the unit implemented its announced 
 strategy to reduce financing portfolio growth and risk.

                  Management Discussion and Analysis of Results 
 Introduction 
 Profit after tax including exceptional costs of EUR6.0m(net of tax), and goodwill 
 of EUR0.6m arising from the "Buzz" acquisition decreased by 5.1% to EUR41.0m. This 
 profit also includes an additional depreciation charge of EUR0.5m relating to an 
 adjustment to the residual value of a Boeing 737-200 aircraft that was retired 
 earlier than planned (see Note 4). Adjusted profit after tax, excluding goodwill 
 of EUR0.6m, and exceptional costs are comprised of aircraft depreciation of EUR0.5m 
 and lease in costs of EUR5.5m(net of tax), increased by 10.2% to EUR47.5m. For the 
 purposes of the MD&A the discussion below is by reference to the adjusted profit 
 and loss account excluding the exceptional costs referred to above. 
 Summary - Quarter ended December 31, 2003 
 Profit after tax has increased by 10.2% to EUR47.5m, compared to EUR43.2m in the 
 previous quarter ended December 31, 2002, driven by continued strong growth in 
 passenger volumes and tight cost control partly offset by lower average fares. 
 Operating margins have decreased by 2.6 points to 23.6% whilst Operating profit 
 increased by EUR11.4m to EUR60.1m compared to the comparative period last year. 
 Total operating revenues increased by 37.2% to EUR255.0m whilst passengers numbers 
 increased by 54.4% to 6.1m. 
 Scheduled Passenger revenues increased by 37.5% to EUR216.4m due to strong 
 passenger volume growth, offset by a 10.9% decline in average fares during the 
 period. 
 Ancillary revenue increased by 35.4% to EUR38.6m, which is less than the growth in 
 passenger volumes and reflects strong growth in non-flight scheduled revenue, 
 car hire and hotel revenue offset by the cessation of the charter programme as 
 Ryanair replaced charter capacity with scheduled services. Ancillary revenues 
 were also negatively impacted by the strength of the euro versus sterling, as 
 65% of ancillary revenues are denominated in sterling. Ancillary revenue, 
 excluding charters increased by 45.4% and now accounts for 15.1% of total 
 revenues compared to 14.3% in quarter 3 of fiscal '03. 
 Total operating expenses increased by 42% to EUR194.9m due to the increased costs 
 associated with the higher level of activity, primarily staff costs, fuel, route 
 charges, depreciation and airport & handling costs associated with the growth of 
 the airline. Costs continue to increase at a lower rate than the growth in 
 passenger numbers principally reflecting the increased operational efficiencies 
 arising from the higher proportion of 737-800 aircraft operated. However they 
 increased at a faster rate than the growth in revenues due to decreases in 
 yields described above. 
 Other income/expenses declined significantly by EUR7.1m due to lower deposit 
 interest rates and higher interest payable arising from the increased level of 
 debt during the period. 
 Net margins as a result of the above declined from 23.2% to 18.6% whilst net 
 profit increased by 10.2% to EUR47.5m.

                       RYANAIR DELIVERS RECORD Q3 PROFITS, 
                    TRAFFIC GROWS BY 54%, PROFITS RISE BY 10% 
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today (Wed 28 Jan 2004) released 
 financial results for the quarter ended 31 Dec'03 showing record profits and 
 traffic figures, whilst passengers benefited from fares which were on average 
 11% lower than the equivalent period last year.

         Note 1: Adjusted profit after tax and EPS, excludes the exceptional 
         costs of EUR6.0m (net of tax) arising from the earlier than planned

 Traffic for the quarter grew by 54% to 6.1m, whilst average fares declined by 
 11%. Total revenues rose by 37%, operating costs rose by 42% - significantly 
 less than the rate of traffic growth - as unit costs fell by 8%, whilst after 
 tax margins declined from 23% to 19% for the quarter. Adjusted net profit after 
 tax rose by 10% to EUR47.5m. 
 This quarter marked a number of important milestones in Ryanair's growth as 
 follows; 
    Overtaking Easyjet to become Europe's largest low fares airline. 
    Overtaking BA's UK/Europe traffic, making Ryanair Britain's favourite 
     airline. 
    Selected 2 more new European bases in Rome and Barcelona. 
    Cumulative after tax profit margin continues to be over 20%. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
    Closing cash balances of EUR1.12 billion. 
 As we have consistently highlighted in previous quarterly statements, we remain 
 very cautious in our outlook for fares and yields. Based on initial bookings for 
 the first three calendar months of 2004 (Q.4 of 2003/04) we now expect that 
 yields during this final quarter may decline by between 25% to 30% over those 
 recorded in the comparable quarter last year. These reductions in fares are 
 significantly greater than the 10% to 15% range recorded over the first three 
 quarters. If these lower fares and yields occur (bearing in mind we have not 
 completed even the first month of this quarter) then we would expect net profit 
 before exceptionals for the fiscal year to reduce by up to 10% from a net profit 
 of EUR239m last year to approximately EUR215m for the current fiscal year. 
 Announcing these results in London this morning, Ryanair's Chief Executive, 
 Michael O'Leary said: 
     "We are very pleased with the strong growth in traffic and profits for the 
     third quarter which demonstrates the success of our strategy of rapid 
     capacity expansion across new bases and new routes, over the past year. The 
     yield reduction of 11% - although greater than originally expected - has 
     stimulated a 54% increase in traffic, whilst an 8% reduction in unit 
     operating costs has ensured that our strong profitability continues. 
     "Early indications for yields in our fourth quarter suggest a marked further 
     reduction of between 25% to 30% due to 1) our continuing substantial 
     capacity growth, 2) the launch in January and February of two new bases at 
     Rome Ciampino and Barcelona Girona, 3) the impact of Sterling's continuing 
     weakness against the Euro, 4) intense price competition all over Europe as a 
     result of enormous capacity growth, particularly from chronically loss 
     making start-up airlines and flag carriers. 
     "There is therefore considerable downward pressure on fares and yields as 
     many of these loss making airlines try to compete and survive. Despite this 
     difficult market Ryanair continues to profitably develop new routes, new 
     bases and grow market share. In many cases Ryanair is leading the downward 
     pressure on prices and yields, but unlike our competitors we continue to 
     generate world leading profit margins as a result of our aggressive cost 
     management and lowest cost base. 
     "Ryanair's strategy continues to be successful all over Europe. Traffic has 
     grown by over 50% so far this year. We have launched 4 new bases in Europe, 
     and 73 of our 146 routes are in their first 12 months of operation. While we 
     now expect after tax profits for the current year to dip slightly, our 
     annualised profit margin will still be in excess of 20% and Ryanair will 
     continue - by some considerable distance - to be the world's most profitable 
     airline by margin. 
     "We have seen a number of these cycles in the industry before. Ryanair 
     continues to grow strongly and profitably, even during periods such as now 
     when fares and yields are being lowered at a faster rate than predicted. Our 
     response to these market conditions will be to continue to lower fares and 
     yields, exploit our huge cost advantage, and tightly manage further cost 
     reductions so that we continue to deliver industry leading low fares and 
     profit margins. 
     "Our determination to continue to reduce fares and yields is strengthened by 
     our experience in recent quarters where many competitors have been forced to 
     reduce their frequency and capacity or withdraw from markets were they 
     compete with Ryanair's low fares. 
     "Looking forward to the next fiscal year (04/05) it is impossible in the 
     current climate to make accurate forecasts on fares and yields other than to 
     state that Ryanair will always offer the lowest fares in all markets. 
     Despite this overall caution we expect the yield decline next year to be of 
     a lower order of magnitude for the following reasons; 
  1. We do not expect any further weakness of Sterling against the Euro. 
  2. From May onwards, Ryanair's rate of capacity growth will fall from over 50% 
     for the past two years to just 20% per annum. 
  3. Initial indications suggest that the two new bases (Rome Ciampino and 
     Barcelona Girona) will be significantly stronger performers than some of the 
     new routes and bases launched in previous years. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
     "We are confident that average seat costs for the coming year will continue 
     to decline strongly, thanks to continuing cost reductions, the higher 
     proportion of more efficient 737-800's in service, redelivery of the Buzz 
     BAe 146 aircraft and the other recent lease-ins. The weaker U.S. dollar will 
     also have a positive impact on fuel, aircraft and spares costs whilst there 
     will be continued strong growth in ancillary revenues. 
     "We are also initiating a detailed review and reduction of certain elements 
     of our cost base which will include; 
  a. Reducing airport and handling costs where Ryanair continues to deliver 
     exceptional growth, whilst at the same time reducing capacity at those 
     airports that do not share our commitment to lower air fares for consumers. 
  b. We are already in discussions with lessors to reduce to market rates lease 
     costs on some of the former Buzz aircraft. These leases are already the 
     subject of legal dispute and impending proceedings and if these are not 
     successful, then the aircraft will be returned and Buzz Stansted Ltd will be 
     wound down. 
  c. We are renegotiating our long-term maintenance contracts on the basis of our 
     larger fleet size and we are re-examining the timing of our fleet deliveries 
     in order to ensure that capacity growth is maintained at 20% to 25% for the 
     next number of years. 
     "Even in the light of this revised profit guidance for the current year, 
     Ryanair will continue to be one of the world's fastest growing, and 
     certainly the world's most profitable airline by margin. Our net after tax 
     margin will continue to exceed our benchmark target of 20% for the current 
     year despite an enormous and sudden reduction in fares and yields. Our 
     response to competition in all markets will be to beat it by offering lower 
     prices, No.1 customer service and continued cost reduction. Like Southwest 
     in the U.S., Ryanair's model is successful. It is by some distance the 
     lowest cost operator in Europe, we continue to enjoy the support of the 
     travelling public, and we remain tremendously profitable as well as 
     enormously cash generative. Our cash balances at the end of Q3 exceed 
     EUR1.12bn. 
     "Some of our loss making competitors will continue to cut back routes or 
     terminate them, some will consolidate, and some will disappear over the 
     coming years, but we remain determined to ensure that Ryanair - the lowest 
     cost airline in Europe - continues to grow and continues to be profitable. 
     We are building here for the long term and we believe that investors can 
     continue to share in this growth story".

 Adjusted earnings per share have increased by 9.6% to 6.27 euro cent. 
 Balance Sheet 
 Cash and liquid resources have increased by EUR64.4m from EUR1,060.2m at March 31, 
 2003 to EUR1,124.7m at December 31, 2003, reflecting the increased cash flows from 
 the profitable trading performance during the period. Nine additional aircraft 
 were delivered in the period of which one was financed via an operating lease 
 and these, in addition to aircraft deposits, accounted for the bulk of the 
 EUR338.3m incurred in capital expenditure. This was part funded by the draw down 
 of long term debt, which increased, net of repayments, by EUR135.6m during the 
 period. Shareholders' funds at December 31, 2003 have increased to EUR1,457.9m, 
 compared to EUR1,241.7m at March 31, 2003. 
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis - Quarter Ended December 31, 2003 
 Profit after tax has increased by 10.2% to EUR47.5m driven by strong growth in 
 passenger volumes and continued tight cost control, offset by lower average 
 fares. Operating margins have declined by 2 points to 23.6% compared to the 
 previous period. Operating profit increased by 23.5% to EUR60.2m compared to the 
 quarter ended December 31, 2002 whilst profit before tax increased by 9.2%. 
 Total operating revenues increased by 37.2% to EUR255.0m whilst passenger volumes 
 increased by 54.4% to 6.1m. 
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 37.5% to EUR216.4m, reflecting the 
 increase in passenger volumes offset by lower average fares of 10.9%. The 
 decline in average fares is due to the launch of new routes and new bases 
 earlier in the year, the weakness of sterling to the euro (which accounted for 
 5% of the decline), and Ryanair's policy of offering the lowest airfares. 
 Ancillary revenues increased by 35.4% to EUR38.6m, which, excluding charters 
 ancillary revenues has actually increased by 45.4%. This reflects strong growth 
 in all areas of ancillary revenues particularly car hire, non-flight scheduled 
 revenues, hotels and internet related activities. These gains were partly offset 
 by the impact of the depreciation of the sterling currency against the euro in 
 this period due to the large volume of sterling denominated sales. 
 Total operating expenses increased by 42.0% to EUR194.9m due to the increased 
 level of activity, and the increased costs, primarily staff, depreciation, fuel, 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-
 route charges and airport & handling costs associated with the growth of the 
 airline. The weakness of sterling to euro had a positive impact on operating 
 costs as did the efficiencies arising from the increased proportion of 737-800 
 aircraft in operation. 
 Staff costs have increased by 35.2% to EUR29.5m reflecting a 34% increase in 
 average employee numbers to 2,356 and the impact of a 3% pay increase granted 
 during the period offset by savings arising from the stronger euro to sterling 
 exchange rate. 
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 31.5% to EUR25.0m due to an increase in 
 the average number of aircraft owned from 49 to 71, offset by savings arising 
 from the increase in the number of fully depreciated aircraft, lower 
 amortisation of capitalised maintenance costs primarily due to the retirement of 
 737-200 aircraft, and the lower euro denominated cost of new aircraft due to the 
 strengthening of the euro to US$ exchange rate. 
 Fuel costs increased by 46.9% to EUR43.1m due to a 61% increase in the number of 
 hours flown, a stronger euro to US$ exchange rate and an improvement in the 
 fleet fuel burn rate due to a higher proportion of 737-800 aircraft operated. 
 Maintenance costs increased by 41.9% to EUR8.8m reflecting an increase in the size 
 of the fleet operated, an increase in the number of flight hours, and the 
 increase in maintenance provisions relating to the leased "Buzz" aircraft, 
 offset by maintenance savings due to improved reliability arising from the 
 higher proportion of 737-800 aircraft operated as a percentage of the total 
 fleet. 
 Marketing and distribution costs decreased by 63.5% to EUR1.0m due to a lower 
 spend in the quarter on new routes as most new routes were launched in Quarter 
 1. In addition advertising spend is more focussed on new markets with existing 
 market spend declining as the company promotes its fares directly to the 
 customer via its internet site. 
 Aircraft rental costs of EUR2.7m arose during the period reflecting the lease 
 rental costs associated with the acquired "Buzz" aircraft. The charge also 
 includes one month rental relating to the first aircraft delivered to Ryanair 
 under the new operating lease agreement signed during the quarter. 
 Route Charges increased by 72.1% to EUR27.4m due to an increase in the number of 
 sectors flown, an increase in the average sector length and an increase in the 
 size of the aircraft operated which incur a higher charge offset by the impact 
 of a weaker sterling to euro exchange rate. 
 Airport and handling charges increased by 45.4% to EUR38.1m which is less than the 
 growth in passenger volumes and reflects the lower charges on our new European 
 routes and at our new bases. 
 Other expenses increased by 21.0% to EUR19.1m which is less than the growth in 
 ancillary revenues and reflects improved margins on some new and existing 
 products and continued cost control on other indirect costs. 
 Operating profits have increased by 23.5% to EUR60.1m due to the reasons outlined 
 above. 
 Interest receivable decreased by EUR3.1m to EUR5.1m reflecting the lower interest 
 rates obtained on cash deposits during the quarter. Interest payable increased 
 by EUR4.4m to EUR12.5m due to the increased level of debt arising from the 
 acquisition of new aircraft. 
 Taxation is 10.2% of pre-tax profits and amounted to EUR4.6m during the period. 
 The Company's balance sheet continues to benefit from the strong growth in 
 profits. Tangible fixed assets increased to EUR1,611.1m from EUR1,352.4m principally 
 as a result of the purchase of eight new 737-800 additional aircraft since March 
 31, 2003 and the payment of deposits for new deliveries. The Company generated 
 cash from operating activities of EUR295.5m, which funded advance payments on 
 future deliveries of EUR149.9m whilst the balance is reflected in the higher cash 
 and liquid resources figure of EUR1,124.7m. Advance delivery deposits amounted to 
 EUR396.5m at the period end. Total debt has increased by a further EUR135.6m, net of 
 repayments, since March 31, 2003 to EUR972.8m. Shareholder's funds at December 31, 
 2003 have increased to EUR1,457.9m compared to EUR1,241.7m at March 31, 2003. 
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis - Nine months ended December 31, 2003 
 Profit after tax has increased by 14.9% to EUR223.1m driven by strong growth in 
 passenger volumes at lower average fares and continued tight cost control. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-
 Operating margins declined 2.3 points to 30.9% whilst net margins declined by 
 3.6 points to 26.2% compared to the previous period. 
 Total operating revenues increased by 30.9% to EUR851.4m whilst passenger volumes 
 increased by 48% to 17.4m. 
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 30.2% to EUR740.0m primarily due to 
 increased passenger numbers on new and existing routes, offset by a 12.0% 
 decline in average fares. The decline in average fares is due to the launch of 
 new routes and new bases, the weakness of sterling to the euro (which accounted 
 for 5% of the decline), and Ryanair's policy of offering the lowest airfares. 
 Ancillary revenues increased by 35.9% to EUR111.4m, which is lower than the growth 
 in passenger volumes, and reflects the cessation of the charter programme as 
 Ryanair replaced Charter capacity with scheduled services, and also the weakness 
 of sterling to the euro due to ancillaries being predominantly sold in sterling. 
 Excluding charters ancillary revenues increased by 56% due mainly to strong car 
 hire revenues, non-flight scheduled revenues and other ancillary product 
 revenues. 
 Total operating expenses increased by 35.4% to EUR587.9m due to the increased 
 level of activity, and the increased costs primarily staff, depreciation, fuel, 
 route charges and airport & handling costs associated with the growth of the 
 airline. 
 Staff costs have increased by 32.7% to EUR91.0m. This increase reflects a 34% 
 increase in average employee numbers to 2,273, and the impact of a 3% pay 
 increase granted during the period offset by savings arising from the strength 
 of the euro exchange rate to sterling. 
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 26.1% to EUR71.7m(excluding additional 
 depreciation charges on retired aircraft) due to an increase in the average 
 number of aircraft owned from 49 to 71 offset by lower amortisation on 
 capitalised maintenance costs due to the retirement of 737-200 aircraft, and 
 savings due to the increase in the number of aircraft fully depreciated. 
 Fuel costs increased by 30.4% to EUR127.5m due to a 58% increase in the number of 
 hours flown, offset by a decrease in the average US$ cost per gallon, an 
 improvement in the fuel burn rate due to a higher proportion of 737-800 aircraft 
 operated, and the positive impact of the strengthening of the euro to the US$. 
 Maintenance costs increased by 32.7% to EUR31.0m reflecting an increase in the 
 size of the fleet operated, higher maintenance due to the acquisition of the 
 "Buzz" aircraft and an increase in the number of flight hours, offset by savings 
 due to improved reliability arising from the higher proportion of 737-800 
 aircraft operated as a percentage of the total fleet. 
 Marketing and distribution costs amounted to EUR11.0m in line with the previous 
 period reflecting a lower level of expenditure on existing routes and markets, 
 which were promoted via fare offerings on the internet offset by increased 
 expenditure on advertising and promotion of new routes/bases. 
 Aircraft rental costs of EUR6.5m arose during the period reflecting the lease 
 rental costs associated with the leased "Buzz" aircraft and one month's rental 
 for the first aircraft delivered under the new operating lease agreement. 
 Route charges increased by 61.7% to EUR80.3m due to an increase in the number of

 sectors flown, an increase in the average sector length and an increase in the 
 size of the aircraft operated which incur a higher charge, offset by the impact 
 of a weaker sterling to euro exchange rate. 
 Airport and handling charges increased by 33.7% to EUR110.2m due to an increase in 
 the number of passengers flown, the impact of increased airport and handling 
 charges on some existing routes, offset by lower charges on our new European 
 routes and at our new bases. 
 Other expenses increased by 31.6% to EUR58.8m, which is less than the growth in 
 ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some new and existing products, 
 and cost reductions achieved on other indirect costs. 
 Operating margins have declined by 2.3 points to 30.9% for the reasons outlined 
 above whilst operating profits increased by 21.8% to EUR263.4m during the period. 
 Interest receivable decreased by 27.1% to EUR17.6m reflecting the strong growth in 
 cash resources arising from the profitable trading performance, offset by lower 
 deposit interest rates in the period. Interest payable increased by 59.5% to 
 EUR35.3m due to the increased level of debt arising from the acquisition of new 
 aircraft. 
 Taxation has increased by 5% during the period, less than the growth in pre-tax 
 profits and primarily reflects the continued decline in the headline rate of 
 corporation tax in Ireland. 
                        Notes to the Financial Statements 
 1. Accounting Policies 
    The accounting policies followed in the preparation of these 
    consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended December 31, 
    2003 are consistent with those set out in the Annual Report for the year 
    ended March 31, 2003. 
 2. Approval of the Financial Statements 
    The Audit Committee approved the consolidated financial statements for 
    the Quarter and Nine months ended December 31, 2003 on January 26th, 
    2003. 
 3. Generally Accepted Accounting Policies 
    The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results for the Quarter and 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -6-
    Nine months ended December 31, 2003 are based on the results reported 
    under Irish and UK GAAP. 
 4. Aircraft retirement costs 
    Six aircraft (five in Q2, one in Q3) were retired earlier than expected 
    due to the detection during the period of scratch marks ('scribing') 
    that occurred during an aircraft painting programme on these aircraft in 
    1995. It has been determined that the cost of repairing these aircraft 
    is uneconomic due to the short remaining life of the aircraft. 
    Accordingly the Company has determined that the residual value of US$1m 
    (EUR794k) for these aircraft is excessive and as a result has reduced it 
    to EUR250k per aircraft. The cost of this adjustment charge has been 
    reflected in the results for Quarter 2 and 3. Arising from the aircraft 
    scratch marks, which resulted in the earlier than planned retirement of 
    the aircraft, the company is seeking to claim the costs of repairs under 
    its aircraft insurance policies. Amounts paid, if any, will be accounted 
    for as exceptional revenues. 
    As a result of these early retirements the Company has been obliged to 
    lease in seat capacity during the period to enable it to continue its 
    normal flight schedule. The charge in the quarter of EUR6.2m is reflected 
    in Aircraft retirement costs. It is planned that the Company will 
    terminate these rentals by March 31, 2004.

 brought forward the date of the release of its 3rd Quarter financial results

 RYANAIR : 100,000 PASSENGERS ON PAU - LONDON ROUTE
 ADDS e5.4 MILLION TO LOCAL ECONOMY
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (26th August 2003) announced
 that it will carry 100,000 passengers in it's first full year on its new Pau
 - London route, providing an enormous tourism boost in Pau and the Bearn
 region, which will add e5.4 Million to the local and regional economy and
 will create 100 jobs in the area.
 Speaking in Pau today, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
 "The Ryanair effect is already evident at Pau. This year we will carry
 100,000 passengers, 80% of whom will be visitors to this region, boosting
 the local economy, providing jobs as well as giving the people of the Bearn
 region low fares access to London.
 Ryanair currently flies 25 routes to/from France, and like all other
 airports in Europe, Pau competed for Ryanair's business with 20 other
 airports, including nearby Tarbes.
 Ryanair chose to partner Pau because of its efficient facilities, low costs
 and progressive management. It is not surprising that Mr. Denagiscarde,
 General Manager of Tarbes Chamber of Commerce was not happy about it, as
 Tarbes also submitted a similar low cost deal but was not selected. Mr.
 Denagiscarde called Ryanair "dogs" and attacked Pau CCI, claiming Pau had
 paid considerable sums of public money to Ryanair. This was untrue. He
 wrongly accused Pau of trying to "kill" Tarbes airports traffic. This too is
 untrue. It is strange that Mr. Denagiscarde would make such claims when he
 himself and Tarbes CCI, failed to admit that Tarbes airport also offered
 Ryanair a marketing support package similar to Pau.
 Ryanair is working hard with Pau Airport to promote the Bearn region. We are
 committed to delivering jobs and thousands of tourists to Pau, Bearn and
 indeed the whole Pyrenees region (including Tarbes). Both we and our
 partners in Pau are committed to giving Bearn visitors and consumers low
 fares access from London without having to pay Air France's high fares and
REG- Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.L) (RYA.I) Pau - 100,000 passengers.
 suffer the inconvenience of connecting through Paris. The supporters of Pau
 Airport and Bearn region should ignore the complaints of Mr. Denagiscarde
 and Tarbes CCI, which are the understandable upset of a 'mauvais perdants'"

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF ITS STRASBOURG-LONDON ROUTE
 FROM
                               SEPTEMBER 24TH NEXT
                  French tourism and the Alsace region loses to
                 Baden Baden Airport in Germany, just 40kms away
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today (26 August'03) confirmed
 that it had not received confirmation from the Nancy Court of Appeal of
 the stay it had requested on the Strasbourg Court's order requiring the
 Strasbourg Chamber of Commerce to terminate its commercial agreement
 with Ryanair on 24 September next.
 In order to give passengers at least four weeks notice, Ryanair has
 been forced to confirm that with effect from 24 September next, the two
 daily Strasbourg-London flights will be suspended and will operate
 instead to Baden Baden Airport in Germany which is just 40kms away from
 the city of Strasbourg.
 Ryanair sincerely regrets that Air France's misguided Court action has
 resulted in the Alsace region losing the only daily low fare service on
 the Strasbourg route and up to 130,000 visitors a year to Baden Baden
 in Germany.
 Ryanair has confirmed to both Strasbourg Airport and the Chamber of
 Commerce that this suspension will be temporary. If and when we receive
 a stay on the judgement (or win the appeal), then Ryanair will make
 arrangements to recommence flights on the London-Strasbourg route.
 Ryanair expects in time to obtain a stay on the judgement and to
 overturn the original decision of the Strasbourg Court, and when we do
 so, the London service will be secured long into the future.
 Speaking at a press conference in Strasbourg this morning, Ryanair's
 Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said;
     "Ryanair and our partners at Strasbourg Airport are disappointed that we
REG- Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.L) (RYA.I) Strasbourg suspension.
     have so far been unable to get a stay on the decision of the lower court
     which would enable us to continue the route until the appeal is heard.
     However, in the absence of such a stay, we must respect the Court's original
     decision and give our customers at least four weeks notice of these
     alternative arrangements. Obviously Strasbourg's loss will be Baden Baden's
     gain.
     "It is wrong that the anti-competitive Court actions of Air France should
     result in Strasbourg and the Alsace region losing - even on a temporary
     basis - its only scheduled air service to London. It is wrong that the State
     aid rules can be misused by high fare flag carriers to limit competition,
     consumer choice and lower fares.
     "Ryanair and our partners in Strasbourg will fight this appeal and we look
     forward to restoring our successful low fare route between London and
     Strasbourg as soon as we receive notification from the Court of a stay on
     the decision, or as soon as we win the appeal.
     "It is fundamentally wrong that secondary and regional airports in France -
     just because they are owned by Government or local authorities - should be
     prevented from competing with privately owned airports in Europe to win the
     rapid traffic and tourism growth, and the enormous economic benefits which
     Ryanair's low fare services bring to every airport at which we operate. We
     call on the French Government to make its position clear in support of
     regional airports such as Strasbourg who wish to develop low fare, direct
     international routes from their airports. Jobs and tourism in the French
     regions cannot and will not survive if all visitors to France are forced to
     use the Air France hub at Charles de Gaulle. Direct low fare services are
     vital, and the French Government must now support the regional airports and
     Ryanair as we continue to develop tourism and jobs in the regions.
     "I would like to apologise sincerely to all of our customers who will be
     inconvenienced by the switch of these flights from Strasbourg to Baden Baden
     Airport on the 24th of September next. All passengers who hold bookings
     after the 24th of September will be offered either a full refund or a
     transfer of their ticket on our new low fares London-Baden Baden service.
     Our customers and supporters in the Strasbourg and Alsace region may rest
     assured that Ryanair will continue to fight to change the Strasbourg Court
     decision so that we may restore our successful partnership with Strasbourg
     Airport which has in its first 12 months of operation delivered 200,000
     passengers on a route where Air France even in its best year only carried
     30,000".

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES PASSENGER
 GROWTH OF 45% PROFITS INCREASE BY 12%
 Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (5 August '03) announced
 record traffic, and profit growth for the quarter ended 30 June '03.
 Passenger traffic grew by 45% to 5.1m although both average load factors and
 yields declined by 5 points to 78% and by 14% to e41.71, respectively. These
 predicted reductions were due to the launch of 50 new routes and two new
 bases; the weakness of Sterling to the Euro; the closure of Buzz for the
 month of April and Ryanair's commitment to offer the lowest fares in every
 market it serves. Total revenues rose by 26%, operating costs rose by 29%,
 after tax margins declined from 20% to 18%, while Adjusted Net Profit
 increased by 12% to a record e43.8m.

 Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said in London today;
 "These record quarterly results reflect the continuing success right
 across Europe of Ryanair's low fares formula. During what B.A. last week
 described as the most testing period in aviation history, we continue to
 drive down airfares, reduce costs, but at the same time deliver
 increased profits and exceptional margins. Passenger volumes grew by 45%
 to a record 5.1m thanks to the successful launch of 50 new routes, two
REG- Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.L) (RYA.I) 1st Quarter Results.
 new bases at Milan-Bergamo and Stockholm-Skavsta, and the acquisition
 and relaunch of Buzz in May. This strong performance continues, as
 evidenced by the substantial increase in traffic and load factors for
 July'03 (statistics were released yesterday). These recorded a 40%
 growth in traffic over July'02 and a 6 point improvement in load factor
 from 79% in June to 85% in July.
 "Yields, as we predicted, were impacted by a combination of (1) the
 launch of the 50 new routes and the 2 new bases, (2) the weakness of
 Sterling to Euro, and (3) by our continuing policy of driving down
 airfares. We believe that yields for the fiscal year will be lower than
 last year by between 10% and 15% as we offer consumers lower fares
 whilst dismaying our competitors who forlornly hope that yields and
 fares will rise during this year. Of the 14% decline in yields during
 the quarter, 6% was due to the weakness of Sterling (half of all our
 sales are in sterling). This yield dilution will be partially offset by
 sterling cost savings. Our margins have also been diluted by the
 operation of the inefficient Buzz BAe146 aircraft on some routes, but
 these will be replaced by larger and lower cost 737-800's in October
 following our next set of deliveries from Boeing.
 "Apart from offering our passengers even lower air fares, we are
 tremendously proud of our outstanding customer service. The Association
 of European Airlines (AEA) has begun publishing customer service
 statistics since January, and these numbers prove that Ryanair is number
 one among Europe's major airlines for punctuality, least cancellations
 and fewest lost bags. As the recent British Airways strikes at Heathrow
 confirmed, the service that high fares airlines provide when things go
 wrong is no different to that provided by low fares carriers, despite
 the fact that people flying B.A. are paying air fares that are 5 to 10
 times higher than they pay Ryanair.
 "Recently some competitor airports and airlines have initiated spurious
 legal actions to try to restrict route development, competition and
 lower fares at publicly owned airports. It is quite beyond our
 comprehension how an administrative court in Strasbourg could recently
 require the Strasbourg Chamber of Commerce to terminate our low cost
 agreement within two months. Despite the fact that Ryanair is the only
 airline operating the London-Strasbourg route, and delivering almost six
 times the traffic previously delivered by Air France, we may now be
 forced - against our wishes - to either increase air fares on the route,
 or pull off the route in the short-term, until such time as we can
 appeal and reverse this decision.
 "It is ludicrous that Air France having withdrawn ten international
 services from Strasbourg Airport over the last seven years (one of which
 was the London route) can win a local legal action which prevents
 200,000 European consumers benefiting from low fare services between
 London and Strasbourg. We believe these passengers will not travel on a
 high fare Air France service which forces them to go via Charles de
 Gaulle to get to London or Strasbourg. This decision is wrong, it is bad
 for the regional airports of France, it is bad for regional tourism in
 France and could result in some 200 jobs being lost in the Strasbourg
 and Alsace region. We will appeal it, and are confident that this appeal
 will succeed and allow us to continue to develop low fare traffic at
 Strasbourg and tourism in the Alsace region.
 "The only grey cloud on our commercial horizon at present is the
 continuing EU investigation of our low cost base at Brussels Charleroi
 Airport. The European Commission, which has consistently promoted and
 championed deregulation and competition in inter-EU air travel needs to
 send a strong signal to the market that it will not allow political
 lobbying or local court orders to prevent Ryanair (and other low fares
 airlines) making air travel more affordable for consumers all over
 Europe. Over the past twelve months our 18 million passengers will have
 saved over e2.0bn compared to the air fares charged by our high fare
 flag carrier competitors and this year more than 20,000 jobs will be
REG- Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.L) (RYA.I) 1st Quarter Results.
 created as a result of Ryanair's traffic at secondary and regional
 airports all over Europe. Many European consumers who weren't rich
 enough to fly with the flag carriers can now afford to travel to visit
 friends and families and/or go on holidays. We remain confident that
 Commissioner de Palacio will support competition and low fare air travel
 and will support the right of publicly owned airports to compete on an
 equal basis with privately owned airports for this business.
 "We welcome Minister Brennan's announcement that the Irish airport
 monopoly will be split up enabling Dublin, Cork and Shannon to compete
 against each other for traffic. Competition is good for consumers and
 will be good for Irish tourism. We remain concerned about the lengthy
 timescale for the implementation of the split and the mystifying lack of
 progress in the development of competing Terminals at Dublin airport.
 Why are we still waiting for the Irish Government to do something in
 order to kick start Irish tourism and to create more badly needed jobs
 in the Irish economy? Unless this competition is implemented by November
 it will mean that yet another year of tourism growth will be lost to the
 Irish economy. We therefore strongly urge Bertie Ahern's government to
 stop dithering, take some decisions in the interest of consumers, and
 urgently split up the Aer Rianta monopoly by introducing multiple
 competing terminals at Dublin airport.
 "As highlighted by the release of our July traffic statistics yesterday,
 current trading continues to be in line with expectations and previous
 guidance. In July Ryanair became the first low fares airline in Europe
 to carry over 2m passengers in one month, which renews our confidence
 that substantial traffic growth for the full year will be achieved. We
 still continue to believe that yields will be between 10% to 15% lower
 than last year, however, we expect profits to grow materially and that
 we will (as previously predicted) maintain net margins in excess of 20%.
 "This continuing profit growth separates Ryanair from almost all other
 airlines in Europe, and re-emphasises the superiority of Ryanair's
 low-cost, low fares business model, and disciplined way in which we are
 rolling it out across Europe".

                                  AGM Statement
 TBI plc, one of the leading operators of regional airports in the UK,
 is holding its AGM today at 12 noon. At the meeting, G Stanley Thomas,
 Chairman, made the following comments to shareholders:
 "The current year has started well with growth in traffic at each of
 our four core European airports in the first quarter. This trend has
 generally continued in recent weeks. However many of the challenges
 which beset the air transport sector last year have continued into the
 current year. Whilst overall trading remains broadly in line with
 expectations, conditions remain challenging.
 "That said, TBI remains well placed to capitalise upon sustained growth
 in air travel and we remain confident that the Group will continue to
 benefit from the success of the growth in low cost traffic,
 particularly intra Europe.
 "In addition, TBI should see the benefits of improved facilities at a
 number of its locations. The newly improved retail and catering
 concessions at Belfast International are now complete in anticipation
 of further expansion of low cost operations at this airport.
 "The success of bmibaby, which established a second UK base at Cardiff
 in October 2002, has been a positive influence on accelerating plans to
 build a new hotel and leisure complex at Cardiff International.
 Planning permission has been granted for a 150-room low cost
 development, including an additional 400 car parking spaces, situated
 on the business park adjacent to the airport, which will complement
 recent improvements to airport facilities. Similarly, the expansion of
 new terminal facilities is currently underway at Stockholm-Skavsta to
 accommodate increasing passenger numbers as a result of Ryanair
REG- TBI PLC ( TBI .L) AGM Statement.
 establishing a base at this location.
 "Luton remains optimistic that it will benefit from the Government's
 review of airport policy in the South East (SERAS) and recently
 submitted a viable alternative to existing proposals. Further expansion
 of low cost operations is also anticipated at this location in due
 course."
                                                                    1 August 2003

 Ryanair on each of these new routes knowing they're getting the lowest fares

 RYANAIR RESPONDS TO LUFTHANSA'S JUERGEN WEBER, WHO STILL DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
 LOW
 FARES AIRLINES IN EUROPE
 Michael O'Leary, Chief Executive of Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares
 airline, today (Friday 18th July 2003) responded to the comments made by
 Juergen Weber, the Chairman of Lufthansa.
 "Poor old Juergen Weber has continuously got his predictions wrong. Two
 years ago he was predicting that low fares airlines wouldn't work in
 Germany, yet Ryanair is now the fastest growing, most profitable airline in
 Germany ever since.
 "Juergen Weber then predicted that passengers wouldn't use Frankfurt Hahn
 Airport. Yet again this year Frankfurt Hahn is among the fastest growing
 airports in Europe, and this morning announced an 81% rise in traffic, while
 Lufthansa is cutting back routes and passenger numbers.
 "One would think that after getting his forecasts wrong so often, Juergen
 Weber would keep quiet on the subject of low fares airlines, since he
 obviously knows nothing about them. Yet today he suggests that it is
 unrealistic for Ryanair to have a stock exchange value double that of
 Lufthansa. Perhaps he forgets that Lufthansa is forecast to lose
 approximately e360m this year, whereas Ryanair is forecast by analysts to
 make a profit of approximately e280m.
 "Perhaps Juergen Weber has forgotten that profitable airlines are worth more
 than loss making airlines. The proof of this exists in the United States
 where Southwest Airlines, the world's largest low fares airline now has a
 market capitalisation which is bigger than the combined market value of
 American Airlines, United Airlines, Continental and Delta.
 "Ryanair will continue this year to grow faster than Lufthansa and to make
 more money (despite selling much lower fares) than Lufthansa. This is
 because Ryanair is providing German consumers with choice, low fares, brand
 new aircraft, with direct access to cities all over Europe. Juergen Weber
RCS-Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.L) (RYA.I) Response to Lufthansa.
 said it couldn't be done in Germany, but Ryanair and 3 million passengers at
 Frankfurt Hahn have proven his predictions wrong."

 RYANAIR LAUNCHES BIGGEST EVER WINTER SCHEDULE

 This year, we launched two new bases in Europe - Milan and Stockholm -
 and added new routes to France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal,
 Spain, and Scandinavia.
 "We've increased the frequency and put larger aircraft on some of our
 popular routes so that people have an even greater choice over when they
 travel. For example, we've increased capacity on our London-Brussels and
 London-Dusseldorf routes, which will be great news for disappointed BA
 passengers who've just had those routes cancelled by the airline.
 "We're also flying to popular ski resorts such as Salzburg, Turin, St
 Etienne and Graz, which will enable skiers plan their own ski programmes
 at fares that nobody else can match.
 "Flights for the winter will be in huge demand, so passengers are
 advised to book early on              www.ryanair.com to get the lowest fares,

 RELEASE: 7TH JULY 2003.
 EASYJET FIGURES AGAIN CONFIRMS RYANAIR AS
 EUROPE'S No.1 LOW FARES AIRLINE.
 Ryanair was today (7th July03) again confirmed as Europe's No.1 low fares
 airline. Passenger figures released by Easyjet for June 2003 confirmed that
 Ryanair carried 80,000 more passengers than Easyjet during June.
 Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
 "The travelling public are voting with their feet, when it comes to low
 fares, punctuality and customer service. Not only has Ryanair carried MORE
 passengers than Easyjet in June - Easyjet actually carried FEWER passengers
 in June03 than they did in May03.
 Easyjet quote growth of "83% for June 03" - however the reality is somewhat
 more modest at 13.5% when the actual figures of Easyjet and GO are combined.
 They confirm "Easyjet and Go Fly carried 1,543,149" representing an actual
 increase of 13.5%.
 Easyjet can't match Ryanair on low fares and they can't match Ryanair on
 punctuality and customer service either. This is why more people are
 choosing to fly with Ryanair."

                    Initiation of Quarterly Traffic Statistics
 TBI's four European airports* handled a total of 3.6 million passengers
 during the period from 1 April to 30 June 2003, an increase of 19.5%
 over the corresponding period last year (2002: 3.0 million).
 Low cost traffic led the growth across the portfolio increasing by
 37.1% to 2.6 million passengers, while full service fell to 233,600
 passengers in line with expectations and charter reduced marginally by
 2.1% to 791,300 passengers. The charter figures are particularly
 respectable given the pressures facing this market during the period
 under review including the Gulf War and the weakening pound.
 On an airport-by-airport basis all of the Group's core airport
 locations saw passenger growth of over 8%. Cardiff and Stockholm saw
 the greatest growth of 35.6% and 260.5% respectively primarily through
 bmibaby's establishment of its second UK base at Cardiff and Ryanair
 launching its Scandinavian base at Stockholm-Skavsta.
 Nb:     TBI's European airports constitute:
         London Luton, Belfast International, Cardiff International and Stockholm-Skavsta

 DANISH COURT CONFIRMS RYANAIR IS CONSUMER'S
 NO.1 AIRLINE IN DENMARK
 Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today welcomed a Danish court's
 decision which confirms that Ryanair is the Danish consumer's No. 1 airline
 for low fares, punctuality and customer service.
 The court confirmed that Ryanair's advertisements showed the lowest fares
 and that no complaints were received by Danish consumers. Earlier in court
 the Danish Ombudsman had admitted the complaints were filed by the high fare
 airlines SAS and MAERSK.
 Speaking in Denmark today, Ryanair spokesman Warwick Brady said: "We're
 delighted with the court decision, which threw out these baseless claims
 against Ryanair.
 "Ryanair has flown over 650,000 passengers to and from Denmark since 1999,
 saving Danish consumers millions over the high prices of SAS and Maersk.
 "The judge acknowledged the case was about SAS and MAERSK and not the
 consumer. The Ombudsman should resign now that he has admitted putting the
 interests of SAS and Maersk ahead of the Danish consumers. Ryanair has
 provided Danish consumers with Europe's No. 1 low fares, punctuality and
 customer service and the SAS/Maersk high fare airlines don't like it".

 EASYJET, THE ALMOST ALWAYS LATE AIRLINE, LATE AGAIN!
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares on-time airline, today (23 June 03)
 revealed for yet another week, (24th week this year so far) that Ryanair's
 punctuality is leaving Easyjet standing. On-time figures released by both
 airlines for week ending 15 June 03, show that whereas 95% of Ryanair's
 flights arrived on time, Easyjet could only manage an awful 77%.
 Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
 "Ryanair is Europe's No.1 when it comes to low fares and on time
 performance. Week in, week out Ryanair consistently provides the best on
 times of any airline in Europe. Easyjet's latest statistics show their
 shoddy performance, when it comes to getting passengers to their
 destinations on time.
 Easyjet are just another high fares, almost always late airline. They are
 hopeless when it comes to efficiency and on time performance, and their
 fares are 70% more expensive than Ryanair.
 Ryanair is committed to telling the public the truth - there is only one low
 fares, on time airline and that's Ryanair, not Easyjet.
 On time performance - week ending 15th June 03

 traffic and profit growth for the year (end 31 Mar'03). Passenger traffic

 yields was a result of continuing price promotions, the launch of over 20
 new routes, a new base in Milan-Bergamo, and Ryanair's commitment to offer
 the lowest fares in every market it serves. Total revenues in the year rose
 by 35%, however operating costs rose at a slower rate by 26%. As a result
 Ryanair's after tax margins increased exceptionally from 24% to 28%, and Net

 Announcing these results, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said in
 London today;
 "These results demonstrate how robust Ryanair's lowest fares business
 model is in Europe. Our fares are much lower than any other EU airline
 and our outstanding team of 1,900 people remain committed to
 relentlessly driving down air fares. As our people now form one of our
 largest shareholder blocks, I am delighted that their efforts are being
 rewarded, not just with higher pay and rapid promotion, but also with
 increasingly valuable share options. We will continue to lower costs and
 we will use these low costs and record profit margins to drive down
REG- Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.L) (RYA.I) Final Results.
 fares even faster and stimulate rapid growth.
 "Ryanair has - for the fifteenth year in a row - delivered increased
 profits, despite a 6% reduction in average fares, at a time when most of
 our competitors are reducing capacity and announcing losses. The market
 has suffered from high fuel prices, the war in Iraq, the impact of SARS
 and the continuing effect of the economic downturn in many European
 countries. Despite these difficult conditions Ryanair's continued
 profitability stems from the fact that we have the lowest costs and the
 lowest air fares which no other European airline can match. I can think
 of no better way to prove our determination to lower air fares than to
 announce a record low fare seat sale. So this morning we released one
 million low fare seats at ?19.99 and ?29.99 one way for travel during
 the peak Summer months of June, July and August. Passengers should book
 these immediately at www.RYANAIR..COM because these record low prices,
 for peak Summer flights will be snapped up in record time.
 "Shareholders should be aware that these results for the past 12 months
 have been exceptional. We have repeatedly stated that profit margins of
 almost 30% are a one off and non-sustainable. Our business plan remains
 (a) to grow traffic on average by 25% per annum and (b) maintain a
 profit (after tax) margin of approximately 20%. Obviously some years we
 will fall below these averages and some years - such as above - we will
 exceed them.
 "In recent months we have launched two new bases (Milan Bergamo and
 Stockholm Skavsta) and 12 former Buzz services among a total of 50 new
 routes. These new routes will generate abnormal traffic growth of 50%
 for the coming year. We will drive down fares (by more than our normal
 5% target) and at this stage expect yields for the year to decline by at
 least 10% and possibly more depending on the extent to which Sterling
 weakens against the Euro. This is great news for our customers but bad
 news for competitors (many of whom are hoping that their fares will
 rise). With the launch of 50 new routes out of a total network of 125
 load factors will also decline this year to about 80%. Our margins will
 also be diluted by the closure and relaunch of the Buzz operation (which
 was grounded for the entire month of April) and the negative impact of
 operating expensive BAe146 aircraft on certain routes which will be
 replaced by larger and lower cost Boeing 737-800's next year.
 "The last quarter of the year was also notable for a significant
 increase in our aircraft order with Boeing which was increased, at lower
 prices to 125 firm and 125 option aircraft. This is the largest ever
 order by any European airline for narrowbody aircraft. Ryanair intends
 to continue with the single aircraft fleet model which was pioneered by
 Southwest and which has proven so profitable for us over the past
 fifteen years. These aircraft give us the capacity to continue to grow
 (after this year) at about 25% per annum by opening up new bases and new
 routes from existing bases.
 "With up to 40 new airports and 9 potential new bases presently under
 negotiation we have more growth opportunities than we need for the next
 five years. We will continue to grow in a safe and controlled manner,
 and within the next three years we plan to carry more than 30 million
 international scheduled passengers per annum at which point we will
 overtake both Lufthansa and British Airways to become the largest
 international scheduled airline in the world. The fact that the largest
 international airline in Europe will also be the one offering the lowest
 fares and the best customer service (we are presently ranked No.1 in
 Europe for on-times, completions and fewest lost bags) is good news for
 European consumers and bad news for our higher fare competitors.
 "It is depressing - yet again - to record that Ireland continues to be
 the only country in Europe to miss out on this extraordinary traffic and
 tourism growth. We are still waiting for the Irish Government to stop
 talking about competition and start doing something about it. The
 development of competing terminals and the splitting up of the Aer
 Rianta monopoly has received further support from the Government
REG- Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.L) (RYA.I) Final Results.
 appointed Committee of "Wisemen", the Irish Hotels Federation, Aer
 Lingus - the Irish State airline - and the Government's own tourism
 review group. At a time when the Irish Prime Minister has recently
 called for greater competitiveness in every area of Irish life, one
 would think that he would at least set an example by breaking up his own
 airport monopoly and we again call on him to get on with it. It's time
 for less talk and more action from this Government if the Irish tourism
 industry is to be rescued.
 "Our business in the current quarter continues to grow very strongly. As
 we announced this morning, traffic for the month of May - with the
 inclusion for the first month of the former Buzz routes - was 53%
 greater than May last year. We have driven down yields by 15% during the
 month, of which 5% points is due to the weakness in Sterling against the
 Euro. I personally expect no near term improvement in either the low
 fare environment or the strength of the Euro, and believe therefore that
 yields for the year will continue to be 10% to 15% lower than last year.
 However this negative revenue effect (of weaker Sterling) will be
 partially compensated by lower Sterling costs. In addition the strength
 of the Euro against the Dollar will substantially lower costs of
 aircraft acquisitions, fuel and spares over the coming years.
 "Looking forward we remain confident of another successful year for
 Ryanair during which we will deliver substantial traffic growth. Even
 though we will drive down fares and yields we expect to maintain our
 normal profit margins of just over 20% and record our sixteenth
 consecutive year with a material increase in profits.

 AER LINGUS CAN'T MATCH RYANAIR'S FARES
 AND CAN'T MATCH RYANAIR'S CUSTOMER SERVICE
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today welcomed the limited release
 by Aer Lingus (Ireland's high fares airline) of some customer service
 information for recent weeks. These figures confirm that Aer Lingus can't
 match Ryanair's prices and can't match Ryanair's service either.
 1. -Aer Lingus's audited average fares are still three times higher than
 Ryanair's. The recently released audited accounts of Aer Lingus show that it
 carried 6.3 million passengers last year, with total sales of e958m
 (excluding discontinued operations) for an average fare of over e152 per
 passenger. Ryanair's last audited accounts confirm that its average fare was
 just e49, less than one third of Aer Lingus's average fare.
 2. -Aer Lingus claim that their average fares are lower, but still refused
 to
 provide audited figures for its average fares even excluding the US traffic.
 Aer Lingus wants to hide the fact that it was, and still is a high fares
 airline.
 3. -Aer Lingus's own figures prove they can't match Ryanair's customer
 service
 either. Aer Lingus were forced Tuesday to publish customer service
 statistics for punctuality, lost luggage and passenger complaints. It's
 interesting that Aer Lingus produced the lost baggage and punctuality
 statistics for the past four months, but would only produce the punctuality
 statistics for the last 5 weeks. Obviously Aer Lingus are still trying to
 hide the truth of their abject punctuality from the travelling public.
 Aer Lingus's own statistics now confirm that Ryanair beats them every time
 for prices, punctuality, lost bags and customer complaints.
 Willie Walsh, the Chief Executive of Aer Lingus claims that Aer Lingus is
 now much more competitive. More competitive than what? Aer Lingus's fares
 are still three times higher than Ryanair's and it can't match Ryanair's
RCS-Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.L) (RYA.I) Ryanair vs Aer Lingus.
 customer service. Very little has changed at Aer Lingus, it's still ripping
 off the Irish public as Willie Walsh himself confirmed at the recent PD
 conference in Galway.
 Welcoming this belated publication of Aer Lingus's customer service
 statistics today, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said;
 "These figures prove yet again that Aer Lingus can't match Ryanair's fares,
 can't match Ryanair's punctuality and can't match Ryanair's service. It's a
 pity that Aer Lingus won't take up the Ryanair challenge to publish their
 audited average fares which Willie Walsh claims are lower than stated in
 their accounts, but we will keep on trying to embarrass him into publishing
 the truth.
 In the meantime the Irish public can continue to obtain the lowest fares,
 the most on-time flights and the best customer service by flying Ryanair."
 Comparison of Aer Lingus and Ryanair's published punctuality statistics and
 average fares.

 RYANAIR TEACHES EASYJET HOW TO BE A LOW FARES AIRLINE
 Ryanair today (Wednesday, 28th May 2003) welcomed Easyjet's announcement
 that the introduction of hedging would be the latest effort by Easyjet to
 try to dismantle its "high fares model". Easyjet have for many years claimed
 that "hedging doesn't matter" while they continue to charge passengers air
 fares that are 70% higher than Ryanair's and most recently announced ?50m
 losses despite these substantially higher fares.
 Welcoming this latest admission by Easyjet, that it can't match Ryanair's
 prices or Ryanair's business model, Ryanair's Chief Financial Officer,
 Howard Millar said:
 "If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, we are pleased to receive
 this latest compliment from Easyjet. However given that Easyjet's fares are
 70% higher than Ryanair's, Easyjet obviously still have a long way to go. So
 here's a couple of "easy hints" for Easyjet as they try to copy the Ryanair
 model for really low fares.
 -Fly to uncongested, efficient airports, not high cost slot restricted
 ones.
 -Fly only Boeing 737's, cancel the order for Airbus's, a mixed fleet won't
 work.
 -Offer the lowest fares in every market (sorry - only Ryanair do that).
 -Have the lowest costs in every market (sorry - only Ryanair do that).
 -Offer the No.1 customer service delivery (sorry - only Ryanair do that)
 Easyjet's punctuality is miles behind Ryanair's
 "Nevertheless Easyjet should keep trying, because God loves a tryer, but
 passengers prefer Ryanair".

 RYANAIR REFER UNTRUE EASYJET ADS TO THE ADVERTISING STANDARDS AUTHORITY
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (22 May 03) referred an
 Easyjet ad which contains false claims to the Advertising Standards
 Authority. In yesterday's papers Easyjet ran an ad claiming to offer the
 "lowest fares to the Sun". This is factually untrue because Easyjet don't
 offer the lowest fares to the Sun, the Moon or anywhere else. Easyjet's
 average fares are 70% more expensive than Ryanair to the Sun, to Spain, to
 France to Italy or anywhere else.
 In recent months both Easyjet's CEO Ray Webster and Easyjet's spokesman Toby
 Nichol have both confirmed that Easyjet charges higher fares than Ryanair
 and it is clear therefore that any claims that Easyjet offer the lowest
 fares is factually untrue.
 Calling on Easyjet to withdraw this inaccuracy Ryanair's spokesman, Paul
 Fitzsimmons said;
 "Easyjet don't offer the lowest fares to the Sun, the Moon or even the
 Stars. Easyjet don't even offer the lowest fares to/from Luton. In every
 market where Easyjet operate, only Ryanair offers the lowest fares. Easyjet
 is just another high fares airline. Don't take my word for it, because
 Easyjet said it on 26th February last;
 "We have a higher cost base than Ryanair, but we have higher fares than
 Ryanair" Easyjet's Toby Nichol said (The Independent 26 February, 2003)
 It is a bit rich of Easyjet to be slagging off a major fraud, when they seem
 to have an equally tenuous grip on reality themselves. They know that only
 Ryanair offer the lowest fares. For the lowest fares to the Sun, the Moon,
 the Stars, or indeed Luton passengers should click on
 www.RYANAIR.COM, which
 by the way is also the webs favourite airline, Easyjet.com is - as usual -
 in second place.

 AER LINGUS ARE STILL HIDING THE TRUTH
 AND STILL RIPPING OFF THE IRISH PUBLIC
 Wednesday, 14th May 2003 - The Chief Executive of Aer Lingus, Willie Walsh,
 who recently confirmed that Aer Lingus has been ripping off the Irish public
 for years - yesterday complained that Ryanair's estimate for Aer Lingus's
 average fare wasn't correct. He wants Ryanair to compare average fares on a
 like for like basis, in which they claim;
 Michael O'Leary, the Chief Executive of Ryanair has written again this
 morning to Willie Walsh (see attached) challenging him to provide an
 auditors confirmation of Aer Lingus's scheduled revenues for the last 12
 months. If Ryanair receives this information we will amend our ads to
 contain an exact like for like comparison. Of course this would not be
 necessary if Willie Walsh and the Directors of Aer Lingus hadn't hidden this
 information in Aer Lingus's recent annual accounts
 "Segmental disclosure of turnover by source and destination are not
 provided as the Directors are of the opinion that disclosure of such
 information would be prejudicial to the interests of the group".
 Ryanair also challenged Aer Lingus to publish their statistics for customer
 service. For each of the last three months when the Association of European
 Airlines has published passenger service statistics for on-time flights,
 flight cancellations and lost bags, Aer Lingus has been the only member
 airline to refuse to disclose its performance. These figures confirm that
 Ryanair offers the No.1 punctuality, No.1 rate of flight completions and is
 No.1 for fewest lost bags, whereas Aer Lingus - as usual - is still charging
 high fares and providing poor customer service.
 Responding to Aer Lingus's challenge today, Ryanair's Chief Executive,
 Michael O'Leary said;
 "It's time for Willie Walsh and Aer Lingus to come clean and stop hiding
 the truth. As Willie himself confirmed Aer Lingus have been ripping off
 the Irish public for years and the rip off continues. They won't reveal
RCS- Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.L) (RYA.I) AerLingus Hiding Truth.
 their average air fares precisely because they are so high, and they
 won't reveal their on-time performance because it is so low.
 "Ryanair continues to beat the pants off Aer Lingus for low fares,
 on-time flights and No.1 customer service. Aer Lingus don't want the
 truth, because Aer Lingus can't handle the truth".

 "Easyjet can't match Ryanair's low fares, can't match Ryanair's
 extensive European route network, and can't match Ryanair's No.1 record
 for on-time punctuality, and just like all other high fares airlines,
 this week they showed they can't make money either."
 Corporal O'Leary added:
 "Ryanair are here to liberate the travelling public from Easyjet's high
 fares, and on our "deck of cards" the Easyjet CEO can join the rest of
 the high fares jokers on our NOT wanted list."

 APPEAL COURT CONFIRMS THAT LUFTHANSA CAN'T HIDE FROM ITS HIGH FARES
 Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, welcomed the Cologne Appeal
 Court's decision today(30th April 03), which removes the last obstacle to
 Ryanair comparing its low fare, efficient services out of Frankfurt Hahn
 Airport with Lufthansa's high fares out of the congested Frankfurt Main
 Airport. The Court's decision dealt with the last two remaining issues in a
 long legal battle which was sparked by Lufthansa's attempts to prevent
 Ryanair from showing German consumers just how ridiculously high Lufthansa's
 fares really are.
 The Court acknowledged in the oral hearing that Ryanair cancompare its low
 one way services with Lufthansa's incredibly high one way fares. Lufthansa
 tried to hide behind the fact that it forces passengers to pay a business
 class fare on a one way ticket. The Court also confirmed that Ryanair
 cancompare its services where Lufthansa gets together with another high fare
 airline to offer flights on a competing route with Ryanair.
 Commenting today on the steps of the Cologne Court, Ryanair's Sales Manager
 for Germany, Caroline Baldwin, said:
 "Lufthansa has wasted thousands of euro in legal fees in a hopeless effort
 to try to prevent Ryanair from highlighting how ridiculously high their
 fares are. However, the Appeals Court in Cologne has confirmed, once and for
 all, that Lufthansa can't hide from the truth about their high fares. Our
 comparative advertising has forced Lufthansa to reduce its fares and abusive
 restrictions, as we have done with other high fares airlines elsewhere in
 Europe."

 EUROPE
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline had its position as Europe's No.1
 on-time major airline confirmed by the release of the AEA (Association of
 European Airlines) airline punctuality statistics for March 2003.
 Ryanair recorded 91% of all flights during the month of March arriving on
 time, this made Ryanair the most punctual major airline in Europe during the
 month of March (together with SAS) and Ryanair stands alone as the No.1
 on-time airline for the first quarter of 2003.

 * Source AEA Punctuality Report dated 29th April 2003.
 Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
 "The AEA Consumer Report confirms that Ryanair not only offers the lowest
 fares, but also the No.1 on-time services of any of the major airlines in
 Europe. In fact the AEA report confirms that the major European airlines are
 not only charging very high fares, but you are also much much more likely to
 arrive late than you are on Ryanair, Europe's No.1 on-time airline.
 "Perhaps it is because Ryanair offer much lower fares and better on-time
 services than the high fare AEA members, that this is why the AEA - the
 Association of High Fare European Airlines - has refused to admit Ryanair to
 membership.
 "This report confirms what millions of European consumers already know - if
 you want the lowest fares and to get there on time, you should fly Ryanair -
 Europe's No.1 low fares airline".

 Editors Note: The AEA figures also confirm that Ryanair is also
 No.1 for fewest cancellations and fewest lost bags during March
 and Quarter One '03.

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE BUZZ TRANSACTION WITH KLM
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today (Friday, 11th April 2003)
 announced that it had completed the transaction with KLM, to acquire certain
 assets (but not the company) of KLM UK Ltd which traded as Buzz. The final
 terms involve Ryanair paying a sum of e20.1m to KLM to acquire 10 aircraft
 (6 x 737-300's and 4 x BAe146's), up to 130 employees, together with the
 relevant operating manuals, postholders and some airport facilities that
 were formerly owned by KLM UK Ltd and which comprise the core operation of
 Buzz. KLM UK will retain up to 470 of the staff previously dedicated to the
 Buzz operation, as well as the Headquarters building in Stansted, the assets
 and liabilities of the legal entity KLM UK Ltd which was trading as Buzz up
 to 31 March 2003.
 Ryanair confirmed that the agreed purchase price has been reduced from
 e23.9m to a final agreed figure of e20.1m as a result of a number of issues,
 which arose during the due diligence process. Ryanair has formed a new
 subsidiary - Buzz Stansted Ltd - and this company will operate the fleet of
 10 aircraft, will employ up to 130 people and will hold the UK AOC approval
 to enable the company to commence flying on 1 May next. It is intended that
 the company will operate its aircraft on a subservice basis flying directly
 for Ryanair, primarily operating on a network of 12 routes, which were
 formerly operated by KLM UK/ Buzz.
 Ryanair are delighted to announce that the key operational postholders have
 agreed to join Buzz Stansted Limited, as this forms a core of experienced,
 senior aviation people led by Doug Stephen, Chief Pilot and Roland Stroud,
 Chief Engineer. Floris Van Pallandt the former Chief Executive of Buzz will
 be returning to KLM as previously agreed. The new Chief Executive of Buzz
 Stansted Limited will be Mr John Osborne a former Director of Operations for
 Ryanair and former Chief Executive of GB Airways and Virgin Express. This
 experienced team will work closely with the CAA over the coming weeks to
 ensure a smooth resumption of flight services on 1 May next. Ryanair have
 confirmed that bookings on the 12 routes, which have already been relaunched
REG-Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.L) (RYA.I) Buzz Transaction Completed.
 and will commence flying on 1 May next have been exceptionally strong.
 Already for the month of May over 100,000 passengers have reserved seats on
 these services and for the six months of the Summer period more than 400,000
 seats have already been sold, generating advance revenues of over e20m.
 These advance sales will be more than sufficient to fund the entire
 acquisition of the core assets and operation of Buzz.
 Whilst this transaction has already received approval from the relevant
 regulatory authorities in Ireland and Germany, it has not yet received
 regulatory clearance from the UK competition authorities. This is entirely
 due to the very tight schedule which Ryanair and KLM have adhered to in
 order to complete this rescue of Buzz and the saving of up to 130 jobs.
 Ryanair and KLM have advised the OFT of their intention to complete the
 acquisition without waiting for regulatory approval in advance.
 Welcoming the completion of this transaction today, Ryanair's Chief
 Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
 "We have been delighted with the speed and success of the turnaround and
 relaunch of the core Buzz operation. Thanks to the Herculean efforts of our
 friends in KLM, the outstanding team of people in Buzz and Ryanair, we have
 restructured and relaunched the core Buzz operation within a period of two
 months. This turnaround will transform a company that was losing over e1m a
 week, to one that will be profitable when it relaunches on 1 May next.
 "In doing so we have rescued the core operation of Buzz, we have doubled the
 capacities and halved the fares on 12 of its most important routes. In doing
 so, we will have saved up to 130 highly paid jobs and we will more than
 double the traffic on these routes to over 3 millions passengers during the
 coming year.
 "To achieve such a dramatic and successful turnaround during perhaps the
 worst two months in the history of the aviation industry (when we have been
 bedevilled by a war in Iraq, fuel prices at all time highs and the
 reluctance of people to travel because of fears over security and
 terrorism), is a magnificent tribute to the courage of the 130 outstanding
 people of Buzz who will now form the core of Buzz Stansted Limited.
 "This success would not have been possible without the help and assistance
 of the regulatory authorities and we are working closely with the CAA to
 ensure that it is satisfied with the financial status of the operation and
 more importantly with the operating and safety structures which will
 continue to be managed by the key senior operations and engineering staff of
 the former KLM UK. We are delighted to have secured the services of John
 Osborne who has a long and successful career at senior levels in a number of
 European airlines, and who is now returning to the Ryanair group based in
 the UK.
 "We will continue over the coming two weeks to liaise closely with both the
 CAA and the OFT and look forward to obtaining their approval in due course
 of the purchase and rescue of the core operation of Buzz and its successful
 relaunch from 1 May onwards, as part of Europe's No.1 low fares airline -
 Ryanair".

 New Ryanair Route between UK and France
 London-Stansted - Clermont-Ferrand for e19.99
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airlines, today (7 April 2003) announced a
 new daily route between London-Stansted and Clermont-Ferrand, France with
 fares
 starting from e19.99 including taxes.
 Announcing details of the new route, Conal Henry, Commercial Director of
 Ryanair.com, said:
 "Ryanair's low fares arrived in France in 1997 with the opening of our
 Dublin-Paris route. Air France's high fares stifled travel from France but
 our low fares rapidly changed all that. Today, the French have a choice of
 26 Ryanair low fare routes from France to the UK, Germany, Belgium, Spain,
 Italy and Sweden.
 To date, close to 2m passengers have taken advantage of Ryanair's low fares
 in France and we expect to carry 80,000 passengers on this new route. This
 will be a huge boost to local tourism and we expect it will create many new
 jobs in the region.

 Ryanair's 9th European Base starts today in Sweden
 SIX NEW ROUTES (30 FLIGHTS DAILY) FROM STOCKHOLM SKAVSTA
 * Aarhus * Oslo * Tampere * Glasgow * Hamburg * Paris
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (Friday, 4 April 2003)
 launched its ninth base in Stockholm Skavsta Airport with six new
 international routes to Denmark, Norway, Finland, Scotland, Germany and
 France.
 Speaking at the inaugural opening of its new base, Ryanair's deputy Chief
 Executive, Michael Cawley said:
 "This is Ryanair's most successful base. Our existing routes to London
 and Frankfurt have been hugely successful. Our load factors are over
 75%: we are carrying over 100,000 passengers in the first month on the
 new routes and will carry over 1.5 million passengers in the first year.
 Passengers will save over 3 Billion SEK compared with the high fares
 currently being charged by SAS, Scandinavia's high fares airline.
 "This is a massive boost for tourism in Scandinavia. The City of
 Nykoping will welcome over 1 million visitors per annum, thanks to
 Ryanair and the successful partnership with Stockholm-Skavsta Airport.
 Our arrival here, and the increase in tourists, will create over 1,000
 jobs in the region."
 "Ryanair has allocated up to 4 of its new Boeing 737-800 to its new
 base, operating over 30 flights each day on the new routes. With special
 launch fares from just SEK99, Ryanair's one way fares are over 95%
 cheaper than the one way fares currently offered by SAS.
 "Demand for these seats is high, so hurry today to
 www.ryanair.com."

 RYANAIR CANCELS ROUTE TO GRENOBLE
 Ryanair, Europe's number 1 low fares airline today (1st April 03), announced
 that it was pulling out of its proposed new route from London Stansted to
 Grenoble (French Alps) due to contractual difficulties with the airport.
 This route had been taken on as a result of negotiations with the airport
 after the announcement of Ryanair's acquisition of Buzz but recent
 contractual difficulties have led to Ryanair being unable to conclude an
 acceptable agreement with the airport.
 Announcing the closure of the route, Ryanair's Deputy Chief Executive,
 Michael Cawley said:
 "We sincerely regret closing the route to Grenoble but unfortunately the
 attitude of the airport authorities there gave us no alternative. We already
 fly to St. Etienne in the Rhone Alp region and we will be offering all of
 our existing passengers either a refund or the offer of a transfer to
 another route. It has always been our policy that we need a long-term low
 cost deal to underpin the widespread availability of our low fares which are
 the key to our success. Unfortunately the airport management and the region
 have been unable to deliver on the agreement they originally indicated to us
 and we have no alternative but to terminate the route before it is even
 started. We sincerely apologise to all of those passengers inconvenienced by
 this decision."

 RYANAIR UPDATES MARKET ON BUZZ ACQUISITION
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today (Monday, 31st March 2003)
 updated the market on the progress of the acquisition of Buzz from KLM. The
 due diligence process has now been completed and the final legal
 documentation is being finalised, however the transaction will not proceed
 on 1 April 2003 as originally scheduled, because the acquisition has not yet
 received clearance from the Office of Fair Trading in the UK.
 Both Ryanair and KLM have been in regular correspondence with the OFT, and
 both companies are seeking urgent approval so that the transaction may
 complete as soon as possible in order to save the core operation of Buzz and
 preserve up to 130 jobs at a time of crisis in the aviation industry.
 Approval will also allow crew training to commence in advance of operations
 on 1 May next.
 Ryanair and KLM have received enormous assistance from the OFT to date, and
 neither party envisages any difficulties in obtaining the necessary
 clearance in due course. However since the transaction is subject to
 regulatory approval, it cannot complete until such clearances have been
 received. Details on the final purchase agreement will not be available
 until post OFT approval.

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES
 Ryanair's Customer Service Statistics for February 2003
 Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today unveiled its customer
 service performance for February 2003. Ryanair, as part of its Customer
 Charter, is committed to publishing its customer service statistics each
 month, unlike the high-fare airlines that have shied away from revealing
 their performance figures.
 88% of all Ryanair's 9,895 flights during February arrived on time. No other
 high-fares airline is delivering this type of performance, month after
 month. If they were, they would accept the Ryanair challenge and publish
 their performance statistics every month (and not just on the rare occasion
 they approach Ryanair standards of service delivery).
 Ryanair has consistently proved that if you pay attention to efficient
 turnaround times, and being clear about check-in and departure times, then
 punctuality becomes the standard. And it's Ryanair that's setting the
 standard as the No 1 on-time airline in 24 of the last 27 weeks.
 Complaints per 1,000 passengers against February 2002 have improved by 25%
 and baggage claims have improved by 30%. Both baggage and complaint figures
 are the best for 5 years.

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES
 New Low Fare Route between Belgium and Spain
 Brussels-Charleroi - Barcelona-Girona for e39.99
 and celebrated 3 million passengers at Brussels-Charleroi
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airlines, today (Wednesday, 19 March 2003)
 announced the opening of a new route between Belgium and Spain with a new
 daily route between Brussels-Charleroi and Barcelona-Girona with fares
 starting from e39.99 one-way including taxes. The Company also celebrated 3
 million passengers at Brussels-Charleroi.
 Announcing details of the new route, Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael
 O'Leary said:
 "Ryanair's low fares arrived in Brussels in 1997. Once the public
 realised how much they were saving compared to the High Fares airlines
 like Lufthansa, SN Brussels and British Airways we opened a base here in
 2001. From today, there's even more opportunities to save money with our
 new route with passengers saving over 90% on the SN Brussels high fare
 cost to Barcelona.
 "Since our arrival, we've opened 10 routes from Brussels-Charleroi to
 key destinations across Europe including London-Stansted, Rome,
 Carcassonne and Dublin. We've just carried our 3 millionth passenger
 through Brussels-Charleroi, and we're bringing 900,000 visitors to
 Belgium per annum.
 "But it's not just the routes that make us the most popular low-fares
 airline in Europe. We are the Number 1 airline for flights being on
 time, so passengers know when they fly with us they will get to their
 destination on time. And we set our own exacting customer standards,
 such as responding to customer complaints in 7 days, and publish our
 performance - something the high-fare airlines are afraid to do. All
 this while continuing to provide the lowest fares in Europe".

 RYANAIR RELAUNCHES 13 BUZZ ROUTES
 WITH INCREASED FREQUENCIES
 AND HALF PRICE AIR FARES
 - Core of Buzz's loss making operation saved - Over 90% of Buzz pilots
 accept new contracts with increased pay
 - Ryanair announces 1 million seats on sale for a tenner (?10) - Never
 before has it been so cheap to get away
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today (Monday, 17th March 2003)
 celebrated St Patrick's Day by making a number of significant announcements
 at a press conference in London.
 Buzz pilots overwhelmingly accept new Ryanair contracts
 Ryanair confirmed that it had received acceptances from over 90% of the
 pilots who were offered employment contracts with increased remuneration in
 the new Ryanair/Buzz operation from 1 April next. The balance is largely due
 to people who have yet to return from leave, in order to accept the offers.
 Ryanair confirmed that with these acceptances, it now has sufficient
 personnel to relaunch 13 of Buzz's 24 routes, with increased frequencies
 (over those previously offered by Buzz) and at fares that start at half the
 price previously quoted by Buzz from 1 May onwards. Passengers travelling on
 these routes over the next 12 months will save over e80m over the fares
 which were previously charged by Buzz.
 In addition Ryanair confirmed that it had made a special email offer to all
 former Buzz passengers (whose fares were fully refunded as a result of the
 cancellation of Buzz's flights). They can avail of a special offer to travel
 on these 13 routes during the month of May at half the price of the new
 Ryanair published low fares. In effect these people have already received a
 full refund of their Buzz fares and will now be able to book seats for
 flights during May at one quarter of the fares previously quoted by Buzz.
 Ryanair expects that the rescued Buzz operation will over the first 12
 months operate 8 aircraft, with a total of over 170 people, and will carry
REG- Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.L) (RYA.I) Buzz Announcement.
 almost 3 million passengers at an average fare of just e43. This will be at
 half the average fare charged by Buzz last year, when with 10 aircraft and
 610 employees, it carried less than 2 million passengers, at an average fare
 of over e80.
 Ryanair confirmed that these new low fare seats to Germany, France and Spain
 would go on sale from 10.00am on Monday 17th March (St Patrick's Day),
 passengers are advised to book quickly as clearly these seats will be
 snapped up in record numbers.
 Ryanair announces the sale of 1 million seats "for a tenner"
 Ryanair also announced that to celebrate St Patrick's Day, and the
 successful reorganisation of the loss making Buzz operation, it would
 celebrate by offering 1 million seats across all of its 59 (non Buzz) routes
 to/from London for just ?10 one way (incl. Government taxes and airport
 charges). This "One million seats for a tenner" offer will commence at
 00.01hrs on Tuesday 18th march and will be available for purchase at
 www.RYANAIR.COM
 until midnight (24.00hrs) on Thursday 20th March. These
 seats will be available for travel subject to a three day advance booking
 restriction from the 21st March until the 16th April, and there are over 1
 million seats on sale at these crazy low prices for people who wish to book
 and travel within that period.
 Speaking at this morning's press conference in London, Ryanair's Chief
 Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
 "I can think of no better way to celebrate Paddy's Day than by announcing
 the successful reorganisation of the loss making Buzz operation. Buzz is
 currently losing over e1m a week and KLM have confirmed their intention to
 close it down if the sale to Ryanair doesn't proceed. We are therefore
 delighted that the overwhelming majority of the people who have been offered
 new contracts, at significantly increased remuneration, have decided to come
 on board and join Europe's No.1 low fares airline. Their decision completes
 this rescue and will I believe lead to long successful and well rewarded
 careers in the aviation industry within the Ryanair group.
 "Average pay in Ryanair exceeds the average pay of staff in British Airways,
 Lufthansa and Aer Lingus and I am delighted to welcome these new recruits
 who have chosen to come and work for Europe's No.1 low fares airline.
 "We also look forward to welcoming up to 3 million passengers on board
 Ryanair's low fare services on the 13 Buzz routes over the next 12 months.
 With increased flights, and half price air fares, these customers will save
 more than e80m in the next 12 months, compared to the average air fares
 charged by Buzz over the past year.
 "These announcements today effectively complete the turnaround and
 reorganisation of the loss making Buzz operation. The disposal by KLM UK is
 due to be completed on 1 April next, and we remain hopeful that the various
 regulatory authorities will grant their approval on or before that date so
 that the core operation and over 170 jobs can be saved.
 "Ryanair's own traffic continues to expand rapidly. The new base launched in
 Milan Bergamo on 2nd February is enjoying record load factors, and the
 advance bookings on the ten routes to/from our new Stockholm Skavsta base,
 which starts operations on 4 April are pouring in. The aircraft have already
 been delivered by Boeing for these new bases, the pilots and cabin crew have
 already been recruited and trained, and we can hardly wait to start flying
 and offering millions of Scandinavian consumers real choice and low fares as
 Ryanair smashes the "high fare" SAS monopoly in Scandinavia.
 "Clearly St Patrick's Day wouldn't be Paddy's Day without some form of
 celebration. To mark the occasion and the successful conclusion of the Buzz
 reorganisation Ryanair has decided to offer 1 million seats across our
 entire network for travel over the next 4 weeks for just ?10 one way.
 "In all cases these tenner fares will include Government taxes and airport
 charges, which means that in some cases the net fare charged by Ryanair
 (excluding government taxes and airport charges) will be as little as
 ?0.01p. Penny flights for Paddy's Day. A million seats for a tenner. These
 fares yet again prove, as we say all over the world on Paddy's Day - you'll

 never beat the Irish.
 "Seats at these ridiculously low fares are going to be snapped up quickly,
 by people taking advantage of a short break before Easter and passengers
 should book as early as possible on            www.RYANAIR.COM, Europe's largest travel
 website."

 New Ryanair Route between Germany and Italy
 Hamburg-Lubeck - Pisa for e39.99
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airlines, today (12 March 2003) announced
 its seventh route from Germany to Italy with a new daily route between
 Hamburg-Lubeck and Pisa with fares starting from e39.99 including taxes.
 Announcing details of the new route, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul
 Fitzsimmons said:
 "Ryanair's low fares arrived in Germany in 1999 with the opening of our
 London-Stansted to Frankfurt-Hahn route. Only then did the German public
 realise how much they were saving compared to the High Fares airlines like
 Lufthansa.
 "Since our arrival, we've opened routes to Hamburg-Lubeck and
 Friedrichshafen and opened our base in Frankfurt-Hahn where we now fly 15
 routes across Europe. Since we started flying from Hamburg-Lubeck in June
 2000, we have carried almost 500,000 passengers on the route to
 London-Stansted.
 "To date, close to 3m passengers have taken advantage of Ryanair's low fares
 in Germany. Our Germany-Italy routes are particularly popular. We've flown
 over 500,000 passengers on our Frankfurt-Hahn-Italy routes, of which 190,000
 have travelled on the Frankfurt-Hahn-Pisa route.
 "Now, from the 1st of May, you can fly between Hamburg-Lubeck and Pisa for
 e39.99 - saving you an amazing 95% on the equivalent Lufthansa fare. The new
 Hamburg-Lubeck-Pisa route starts on 1st May 2003 with low fares starting
 from an incredible e39.99, a saving of 95% on corresponding Lufthansa
 routes".

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES NEW ROUTE FROM MALMO TO FRANKFURT-HAHN FROM JUST SEK 299
 Malmo: 27th February 2003 Ryanair, Europe's largest Low Fares Carrier, was
 delighted to announce the commencement of a new route from Malmo to
 Frankfurt-Hahn in Germany today.
 Commenting on the new route today, Conal Henry, Commercial Director for
 Ryanair.com, said:
 "Ryanair are all about low cost base offering the lowest fares to
 consumers. Malmo has been an incredibly successful destination for us
 out of London-Stansted, and given the popularity of our other
 Scandinavian routes (Stockholm, Gothenburg and Oslo) to Frankfurt, we
 are convinced that this new route will be a storming success -
 particularly at the amazing low fare of just SEK 299. Air fares between
 Scandinavia and Germany are still among the highest in Europe with the
 Star Alliance carving the market up between its partners. With Ryanair
 now offering four destinations into Sweden and Norway, those days are
 over."
 Ryanair is offering savings of up to 84% on SAS's fares from Copenhagen to
 London:

 Ryanair also expect great interest for the new route in the Danish catchment

 were lower fares available from Sturup.

 THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS SUBJECT IN ITS ENTIRITY TO THE PROPOSED SALE OF
 BUZZ BY KLM
                TO RYANAIR PROCEEDING AS PLANNED ON 1 APRIL 2003,
                  WHICH REMAINS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVALS
 MAJOR RESTRUCTURING OF BUZZ TO ELIMINATE ANNUAL LOSSES OF e30 MILLION
 AND SECURE
                                   ITS FUTURE.
 Buzz and Ryanair, which recently agreed to purchase Buzz, Europe's No.3
 low fares airline, from KLM, today (26th February 2003) announced the
 details of a major reorganisation with effect from 1st April 2003
 (subject to the acquisition receiving regulatory approvals by that
 date.)These plans will be presented to the creditors and staff of Buzz
 over the coming days, after which a final decision will be taken on
 whether to restart flying as planned on 1 May 2003, or close Buzz
 altogether. The main features of the restructuring are as follows;
 - Buzz flights to be grounded for the month of April 2003, at least.
 - 12 Buzz routes to be terminated on 31 March.
 - 12 Buzz routes will continue from 1 May, with increased frequencies.
 - Buzz fleet reduced from 12 to 8 aircraft (six x 737's and two x
 BAe146's). - Fares on all continuing Buzz routes to be 50% lower, with
 double the seat
     capacity.
 -Up to 400 redundancies in Buzz post grounding on 31 March. - Increased
 pay and productivity allowances for Buzz remaining 200 staff.
 Background to the restructuring
 The financial position of Buzz is extremely precarious. The airline
 suffers from a number of terminal structural problems including an
 inappropriate, mixed aircraft fleet, a poor schedule with infrequent
 (often less than daily) services, with fares that are too high to fill
 its flights (the January load factor was just 48%). The airline, as a
 by-product of its history as Air UK is heavily overstaffed. Buzz
REG- Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.L) (RYA.I) Buzz Restructuring.
 carries less than 3,000 passengers per employee compared to Ryanair's
 figure of almost 10,000 passengers per employee.
 What makes the Buzz business even more precarious is the ongoing
 haemorrhage of losses. In each of the past two years Buzz as a stand
 alone airline has lost in excess of e30m per annum, and is presently
 losing over e 1 Million per week. The imminent threat of war in Iraq,
 the downturn in European economies and increasing intense competition
 from other low fare airlines in the German and French markets means
 that Buzz is currently losing in excess of e1m per week. These losses
 cannot be sustained.
 Grounding of the airline for the month of April.
 Whilst the sale of Buzz is still subject to regulatory approvals, it is
 intended that if the take-over is completed on 1 April, the airline's
 fleet will be grounded for a minimum period of four weeks. This period
 will allow Buzz to effect up to 400 redundancies, while at the same
 time offering improved pay and productivity incentives to the remaining
 200 or so staff who will be needed to operate Buzz's reduced fleet.
 This period will also be used for rebranding of the Buzz aircraft and
 airport facilities in Ryanair livery, to provide refunds for passengers
 on terminated flights, and allow sufficient time for the retraining of
 all Buzz personnel and agents, in Ryanair policies and procedures both
 on board the aircraft, and at the relevant airports. Subject to
 receiving early agreement from the remaining Buzz staff, the airline
 will recommence flying on 1 May next, with a substantially increased
 schedule on 12 of Buzz's most popular routes with fares that will start
 at 50% lower than the fares currently offered by Buzz.
 Buzz management will be briefing all staff this week that if agreement
 is not forthcoming within two weeks from the remaining 200 staff who
 will be offered continued employment in Buzz, then Buzz will be closed
 on April 1, 2003. In these circumstances Ryanair would take over the
 operation and flying of these routes from 1 May next. However, Buzz
 believes that this will not be necessary, as staff will be delighted
 with the better terms and conditions and increased pay which they will
 be offered by Buzz from 1 April 2003.
 Twelve Buzz routes to enjoy double the frequencies at half the fares.
 One of the major contributors to Buzz's current losses is the fact that
 many of Buzz's routes are served inadequately, either once a day (when
 they should be twice or three times daily) or just three or four times
 weekly when they should at least be daily. In addition Buzz will be
 operating almost all Boeing 737 aircraft on many of these routes which
 will ensure that seat capacity increases by at least 100% for Summer
 2003 over the capacity offered by Buzz in Summer 2002.
 Passengers who presently have bookings on flights after 1st April 2003
 will be offered a full refund of their fare. Passengers will then be
 able to rebook themselves with new tickets, at lower prices FROM 12th
 March 2003, on existing or alternative destinations.

 Termination of twelve underserved Buzz routes on 31 March next
 A total of twelve routes which are presently underserved by Buzz will
 be discontinued from 31 March 2003. These are routes that are not
 currently served on a daily basis by Buzz, and as a result the schedule
 frequency is insufficient to sustain profitability. Buzz will continue
 discussions with these airports over the coming months and our
 objective will be to secure a low cost base and efficient facilities,
 which will enable Buzz to offer at least daily or double daily services
 at very low fares to those markets as soon as additional aircraft are
 required.

 Fares on all Buzz routes to be 50% lower
 The really good news for Buzz customers and consumers generally, is
 that Buzz will be reducing air fares by 50% on all of the 12 routes
 which will continue to operate from 1 May 2003. Full details of these
 new routes and lower fares will be available at
            www.ryanair.com. These
 flights and fares will go on sale, subject to resolution of all staff
 issues, on Wednesday 12th March 2003 at
            www.ryanair.com.
 Since Buzz will now be offering more than double the seat capacity on
 each of these routes to Spain, Germany and France, up to 4 million
 passengers per annum will now be enjoying fares that are 50% lower than
 the fares being charged currently by Buzz. Buzz is confident that these
 seats will sell incredibly quickly, and that load factors and passenger
 traffic will mushroom in Buzz as a result of these significantly lower
 fares.

 Up to 400 Redundancies in Buzz
 The one unfortunate feature of this reorganisation is the substantial
 number of redundancies which will be necessary. Up to 400 positions
 will be made redundant, and these will include in the main Head Office,
 sales and administrative staff, approximately 25% of pilots, up to 80%
 of cabin crew (as it is intended that the 737's will be crewed by
 Ryanair's in-flight staff), all cargo and group sales staff, and
 approximately 50% of the current Buzz Ground Ops. people at Stansted.
 These people have made a valuable contribution to the development of
 Air UK, KLM UK and Buzz and it is not their fault that Buzz is
 currently losing enormous amounts of money and cannot compete
 effectively in the marketplace. Nevertheless Ryanair will be
 encouraging these people to apply directly for vacancies which will
 continue to arise in Ryanair over the coming year or more as Ryanair's
 own fleet operations continue to grow strongly both in the UK and at
 our seven other bases in Europe.
 Increase pay and productivity allowances for remaining 200 staff
 Buzz today has also announced that the remaining 200 staff from 1st
 April 2003 will be offered new contracts with significant increases in
 the rates of pay, productivity allowances, as well as improved terms
 and conditions. These jobs will enjoy enhanced job security, better
 promotion prospects, new aircraft and training opportunities and
 improved flight concessions.
 Summary
 The management of Buzz will be meeting with staff groups and
 representatives as part of the ongoing consultation process. They will
 be presenting the stark realities of Buzz's financial crisis, and the
 worsening trading outlook for Buzz given the prospect of war in the
 Middle East, the intensity of competition Buzz faces from low fares
 airlines in the German and French markets, and the escalating cost of
 fuel. The management of Buzz believe that the core of the Buzz
 operation can be saved, but only by increasing frequencies on a core of
 12 routes, massively reducing air fares, and increasing traffic and
 load factors as well as staff productivity. The staff representatives
 will also be left in no doubt of the seriousness of Buzz's financial
 crisis and that the alternative to this reorganisation will be the
 closure of Buzz altogether on 31 March next.

 RYANAIR INVESTS THIRD AIRCRAFT AT GLASGOW PRESTWICK AND ANNOUNCES NEW
 GLASGOW
 PRESTWICK-BARCELONA (GIRONA) ROUTE
 incredible ?29.99 one way including tax
 Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, continues its meteoric growth
 with the announcement today (Tuesday 25 February 2003) that it is adding a
 THIRD Boeing 737-200 series aircraft to its Glasgow Prestwick base and, as a
 consequence, is launching a new direct daily low-cost service to Barcelona
 Girona.
 This is the first-ever daily year-round scheduled service to link Scotland
 with Spanish sunshine on the Costa Brava, the area that virtually invented
 the sun and sea holiday.
 This now means that Glasgow Prestwick has gained three superb new routes
 this year with Bournemouth already in operation and Stockholm starting on
 4th April.
 The new daily Boeing 737 jet service will commence on 22 May 2003 from
 Glasgow Prestwick airport. The flight time will be just two and a half
 hours, fares will start at just ?29.99 one-way including tax, and bookings
 can be made from today on
 www.Ryanair.com. This fare represents a saving of
 66% on the next cheapest direct fare.
 For the Scottish consumer it's fantastic news. It's the first low-cost daily
 service to Spain from Scotland whether for business travel or for those
 looking for a short break in Barcelona, one of Europe's liveliest cities, or
 in some of Spain's prettiest coastal towns and villages.
 Scottish tourism bosses will also welcome the news, as the new route will
 boost the numbers of high-spending Spanish visitors to Scotland, exactly
 what Scottish tourism needs. With 70,000 passengers expected to travel on
 this route in the first year, it will be a major boost for the Scottish
 economy.
 Ryanair Sales Manager Scotland Kathryn Munro said: "This is a fantastic
REG- Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.L) (RYA.I) New Route Announcement.
 announcement for Glasgow Prestwick and for Scotland. Ryanair is the only low
 cost scheduled airline committed to sustained growth and low fares in
 Scotland. We now fly to more direct European destinations than any other
 airport in Scotland and at the lowest prices. "Basing the third aircraft at
 Glasgow Prestwick means the recruitment of up to ten new pilots and fifteen
 new cabin crew for the base in addition to the major asset investment of the
 plane into Glasgow Prestwick. We have been at Glasgow Prestwick for some
 nine years and we'll see massive growth this year with over two million
 Ryanair passengers going through the airport.
 "We know this route will continue the huge success of our existing Scottish
 routes and that it will very popular with the Spaniards who can now access
 Scotland at the lowest fares. We already have three routes operating to
 Barcelona (Girona) from our bases at London Stansted, Frankfurt Hahn and
 Milan, and expect that this new service to Scotland will be just as
 popular."
 Glasgow Prestwick Managing Director Tom Wilson said: "This is tremendous
 news. To be able to fly to Barcelona from Scotland for under ?30 will be
 welcomed by many Scots who have until now had to pay high prices. The
 announcement again underpins Ryanair's commitment to Glasgow Prestwick and
 to the delivery of low fares to the people of Scotland."
 NOTES FOR EDITORS
 The Costa Brava begins at Blanes, 60km north of Barcelona and continues
 northwards around the coast for 220km to the French border at Portbou. There
 are 119 official beaches with a total length of 56km, a quarter of the
 entire coastline. The average summer temperature is 26oC and there are more
 than 200 days of sunshine a year. More than 5m tourists visit Costa Brava
 each year, many of whom are Scots.

 Ryanair announces customer service statistics
 for January 2003
 Ryanair, still the only airline in Europe which publishes monthly customer
 service statistics, today unveiled its performance for the January 2002.
 88% (8,845) of all Ryanair's 10,039 flights during January arrived on time.
 No other airline is delivering this type of performance, month after month.
 If they were, they would accept the Ryanair challenge and publish their
 performance statistics every month (and not just on the rare occasion they
 approach Ryanair standards of service delivery).
 Complaints per 1,000 passengers have been almost halved against January 2002
 and baggage performance has improved by 21%.
 91% complaints were answered, in writing, within 7 days.

 AER RIANTA COST INCREASES LOSE SHANNON RYANAIR'S DAILY FRANKFURT SERVICES
 Kerry Airport wins the business for Irish tourism
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today (Thursday, 13th February
 2003) announced that since the Aer Rianta airport monopoly at Shannon has
 refused to withdraw its proposed e6 per passenger cost increase on Ryanair's
 successful Shannon-Frankfurt route, Ryanair will reduce capacity on the
 route from its present daily service to a weekly service which will operate
 to/from Shannon on a Saturday.
 However, Ryanair is delighted to announce that Irish tourism (particularly
 to the Mid West region) will not suffer as a result of these Aer Rianta cost
 increases, because of a new long-term low cost agreement with Kerry Airport
 which will mean that Kerry will now enjoy a daily return service from
 Frankfurt Hahn. These flights which will commence on Tuesday 1 April, will
 result in 100,000 passengers travelling between Kerry International Airport
 and Frankfurt Hahn and will mean that German visitors to Ireland can
 continue to avail of very low air fares, and will continue to account for
 84% of the 100,000 passengers who travel on the route each year.
 Ryanair regrets the decision by the Aer Rianta monopoly at Shannon to
 massively increase prices on a route that is still developing, and which has
 now meant that one of the few remaining scheduled links between Shannon and
 Continental Europe has effectively been discontinued. Ryanair remains
 concerned that the Aer Rianta airport monopoly at Shannon will attempt to
 impose similar price increases on Ryanair's low fare flights between Shannon
 and Brussels and Shannon and Paris when the three year new route scheme ends
 on those two routes in 2004 and 2005 respectively.
 The policies of the high cost Aer Rianta monopoly are losing Shannon
 passengers and routes, as well as damaging Irish tourism and Irish jobs. It
 is time this monopoly was broken up for good, with competing multiple
 terminals developed at Dublin Airport and that Cork and Shannon are
 separated from the dead hand of Aer Rianta and allowed to develop routes and
 traffic in the interests of Shannon and Cork respectively.
REG- Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.L) (RYA.I) New Route Announcement.
 Low fares between Kerry International Airport and Frankfurt Hahn go on sale
 next Monday, and there are 10,000 seats on sale at an introductory offer of
 just e19 one way (plus taxes and charges) for travel in the month of April.
 We urge passengers to buy now while stocks last at these ridiculously low
 fares.

 primarily due to a further 8% reduction in fares - as predicted - during the
 quarter. This reduction in yields reflects the 1 million free seats
 promotion last October, the launch of four new routes from Frankfurt Hahn in
 December, and Ryanair's continuing policy of offering the lowest fares in
 all markets. Total revenues in the quarter rose by 37%, however operating
 costs - rose at a slower rate by 28%. As a result Ryanair's after tax
 margins, during the worst quarter in the year increased from 21% to 23%, and
 Net Profit increased by 50% to e43.2m.

 Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said;. -TS-
 "These are another good set of numbers which result from the disciplined
 way we are rolling out our low fares all over Europe. They again
 highlight the difference between Ryanair and other so called "low fare"
 carriers in Europe. We continue to earn increasing profits even during
 the Winter period when others have confirmed that they will suffer
REG-Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.L) (RYA.I) 3rd Quarter Results.
 losses. Ryanair's reducing cost base enables us to continue to drive
 down air fares. Lower fares mean higher load factors on our new larger
 aircraft, whose lower operating costs in turn result in increased
 profits. This is a virtuous cycle of lower costs, lower fares, faster
 growth and increasing profits. No other airline in Europe can match
 Ryanair's low fares and the gap between Ryanair's prices and the rest
 continues to widen.
 "We continue to be surrounded by opportunities. The average load factor
 on our four new routes from Frankfurt Hahn in December was over 80%.
 Advance bookings at our new Milan Bergamo base (which starts on 6
 February) suggest that load factors for the first month will be in the
 very high 70's if not 80% as well, and the initial customer response to
 our ninth European base at Stockholm Skavsta (which we announced last
 Tuesday) has been very encouraging. Based on our estimates for the final
 quarter we are now raising our guidance for the full year to e235m net
 profit after tax.
 "We continue to limit any risks associated with our capacity growth by
 spreading it across our network, launching new bases, new routes from
 existing bases, and increasing frequency on existing routes. Last week
 we announced our ninth European base at Stockholm Skavsta, but also five
 new routes from London Stansted (to France, Holland, Norway and Germany)
 and significantly increased frequency this Summer to Frankfurt (6 daily
 flights), Rome (5 a day), Stockholm (5 a day), Barcelona (3 a day) among
 others.
 "All of this growth justifies our 100 new aircraft order which was
 announced last Friday. With world-wide aircraft orders now significantly
 down, there has never been a better time to buy new aircraft. We are
 proud to extend our partnership with Boeing, the maker of the world's
 most popular and best commercial aircraft, the Boeing 737. By ordering a
 total of 125 firm and 125 option aircraft we can begin the replacement
 of the 737-200 series, and maintain further organic growth across Europe
 as we transform Ryanair into the airline with the youngest fleet in
 Europe, in addition to being the most punctual (which we already are)
 and the lowest cost (which we already are).
 "The purchase of Buzz for the insignificant net cash sum of under e5m,
 which was also announced last week was an opportunity too good to miss.
 We will be eliminating a number of Buzz's loss making routes in order to
 allocate some of the aircraft to increase frequency on existing Buzz
 routes from London Stansted. The combination of Ryanair's low fares and
 more efficient airports, as well as the conversion of Buzz into an all
 737 operator over the next 12 months will result in the Buzz operation
 becoming profitable for the first time as we double its traffic from
 under 2m to over 4m pax p.a. We are aware that some commentators fear
 that we are biting off more than we can chew. We are conscious of this
 but one cannot always control the timing of opportunities that present
 themselves. However the purchase price, made this deal in our view, a
 very attractive proposition. Fortune favours the brave, and as Warren
 Buffet has proven many times, the time to buy is when everyone else is
 selling and prices are low. I believe that this is one of those times.
 "With the addition of the Buzz traffic, and Ryanair's own organic
 growth, we expect to carry up to 24 million passengers in the coming
 fiscal year (end 31 March'04), a figure that would see Ryanair challenge
 Air France for the position of Europe's third largest international
 scheduled airline. We have the low fares formula, the people and the
 unrelenting determination to achieve these targets, by delivering
 disciplined, profitable, low fares growth to millions and millions of
 European consumers.
 "Finally a word on the recently announced EU investigation of Ryanair's
 cost base at Brussels Charleroi Airport. This investigation will be the
 test case for the cause of competition, choice and low fare air travel
 in the European Union for the next 25 years. Many of our competitors
 including high cost airports and high cost airlines will seek to use
REG-Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.L) (RYA.I) 3rd Quarter Results.
 this case to block Ryanair's rapid growth at secondary and regional
 airports. They do this in the hope of imposing higher costs and higher
 air fares upon consumers and to block competition and choice. They want
 to return to the bad old days of high fares for the rich few. This is
 wrong. The sole purpose of these incumbent complainers is to prevent the
 spread of choice and lower fares and to limit the growth of low fare air
 travel in Europe.
 "The success of low fare airlines in the United States over the past 30
 years and of Ryanair in Europe over the past 10 years depends upon
 encouraging and incentivizing underused secondary and regional airports
 to compete with dominant hub airports by providing lower costs and
 efficient facilities to those airlines who are willing to offer lower
 air fares to attract consumers to these airports. This is the very
 essence of free market competition, and it is already generating
 enormous savings for European consumers.
 "I have every confidence that the Commissioner for Transport, Loyola de
 Palacio will rule in favour of Brussels Charleroi and the Belgian
 Government, as the evidence is overwhelming that (1) there is no element
 of State aid in our cost base and (2) secondary and regional airports
 offering lower costs and more efficient facilities allied to low fare
 services provided by Ryanair and others is in the best interests of
 competition and EU consumers.
 "European integration and harmonisation depends upon the ease of
 movement of people around the European community. For years in Europe
 air travel was confined to the rich few. Ryanair has changed all of that
 over the past ten years, and we are confident of the continuing support
 of Commissioner de Palacio and the EU Commission as we extend and expand
 the range of choice, routes, services and lower prices that we offer
 European consumers.

 RNS Number:8731G Ryanair Holdings PLC 31 January 2003
                  RYANAIR REACHES AGREEMENT WITH KLM TO BUY BUZZ
 Ryanair Holdings plc, the No.1 low fares airline in Europe today
 (Friday, 31st January 2003) announced that it had reached agreement
 with KLM to take over Buzz for a total payment of e23.9m (less than
 ?15m) which it will fund from its own substantial cash reserves without
 any recourse to the markets. Highlights of this transaction include;
 1. Ryanair will buy the entire issued share capital of Buzz for a total
 of
     e23.9m (?14.95m). Since Buzz will have e19m (?11m) of cash on completion the
     net cost of this purchase is less than e5m.
 2. The acquisition will be funded from Ryanair's existing cash deposits
 which
     presently exceed e1.05 billion, so the cost is nominal to Ryanair.
 3. In the year to 31 March 2003 Buzz will fly just under 2m passengers,
     generating revenues of e140m, with a forecast double digit PBT loss.
 4. Buzz currently operates a network of 21 routes from London Stansted
 to points
     in Germany, Holland, France and Spain, as well as two French domestic
     routes. The company will operate a fleet in Summer 2003 of 6 x BAe 146
     aircraft and 6 x Boeing 737-300's.
 5. As part of the transaction KLM have agreed to take back all of the
 remaining
     BAe146 aircraft at the end of the financial year (31/3/04). We currently
     plan that these will be replaced by more efficient Boeing 737's.
 6. The management believe that by applying Ryanair's low fares/low cost
 formula,
     the traffic in Buzz can be increased this year from under 2m to over 4m
     passengers and the operating losses will be eliminated and profitability
     achieved.
REG- Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.L) (RYA.I) Acquisition of Buzz.
 7. The acquisition is expected by the Directors of Ryanair to make a
 positive
     contribution to Ryanair's earnings per share in the coming financial year
     (end 30 March 2004).
 8. This acquisition, which has been approved by the Boards of KLM and
 Ryanair,
     is expected to be completed, subject to regulatory approval on 1 April next.
 Michael O'Leary, Chief Executive of Ryanair said;
 "The timing of this acquisition is opportunistic. Since Ryanair is
 growing strongly by rolling out our lowest fare services all over
 Europe, the last thing we need is the distraction of an acquisition.
 However there are a number of features of Buzz which makes this a
 favourable move at this time including;
 1. Buzz operates 21 routes from London Stansted which is Ryanair's main
 UK base,
     thereby making it's turnaround easy to manage.
 2. The acquisition of Buzz allows Ryanair to further expand at
 Stansted,
     London's third main airport, and is a timely strategic move.
 3. The cost of the Buzz acquisition is nominal at a net cash cost of
 under e5m,
     which will be a bargain if we can- as we expect - turn it around in one
     year.
 4. Buzz's operation suffers from two structural cost problems, (1) an
     inappropriate expensive fleet and (2) expensive congested airports. Ryanair
     can and will resolve both problems within 12 months.
 5. Ryanair will significantly rationalise Buzz's operations by closing
 a number
     of high cost unprofitable routes and operating the remaining routes at
     increased frequency, lower fares and much lower costs.
 6. Buzz's BAe-146 fleet will be redelivered without cost to KLM within
 the year,
     to be replaced by significantly more efficient Boeing 737's.
 "I am confident that this significant and timely rationalisation will
 eliminate these losses in Buzz over the coming year. With a change of
 aircraft fleet Buzz will be in a position to match Ryanair's low fare,
 profitable growth from 2004 onwards.
 "Customers of Buzz can look forward to new routes, increased frequency,
 larger aircraft and significantly lower air fares from 1 April onwards.
 We will be announcing details of this reorganisation including new
 routes, frequencies, lower fares and timetables before the end of
 February as we implement our plan to transform Buzz into a growing,
 profitable operation.
 "Since the Buzz acquisition will not take place until 1 April at the
 earliest, the current Buzz losses will have no impact on Ryanair's full
 year earnings forecasts. Whilst it has been our policy to avoid
 acquisitions, this opportunity, at this nominal cost is the type of
 offer which we could not refuse. The financial cost is small and the
 diversion of management time will be minimal since Buzz is based at our
 main UK base. We have a simple and effective plan to turn it around by
 delivering lower fares, rapid traffic growth and Ryanair type
 profitability once the BAe146 fleet has been returned to KLM. I am
 confident that Buzz will thereafter make a proportionate and
 significant contribution to Ryanair Holdings' revenues and
 profitability".
 As Ryanair is due to report Q.3 results on Tuesday morning (4 Feb'03)
 we are currently in a closed period, and will not be making any further
 comment on this matter until then. A full analysts briefing and
 subsequent press conference are scheduled for Tuesday morning in London
 for this purpose.

 TBI PLC
 Stockholm Skavsta Airport confirmed as new European base for Ryanair:
 1.5 million passengers a year through Skavsta in 2003
 TBI plc, the owner and operator of regional airports, welcomes today's
 announcement from Ryanair confirming its selection of Stockholm Skavsta
 Airport as its latest continental European hub.
 Ryanair announced that from 4 April 2003 it will allocate up to four
 aircraft to its new base in Stockholm, operating over 30 flights each day
 from Stockholm on six new international routes to Aarhus, Glasgow, Hamburg,
 Paris, Oslo and Tampere (Finland) - in addition to its successful existing
 routes to London and Frankfurt.
 This new Scandinavian base will result in the creation of over 200 new jobs
 in Stockholm and will result in over 1.5 million passengers being carried
 through Stockholm Skavsta in the first year of this new base.
 Commenting on today's announcement, Keith Brooks, Chief Executive of TBI plc
 said:
 "I am delighted that Ryanair has selected Stockholm Skavsta Airport to be
 its next hub. There was clearly strong competition from other continental
 European airports to win the award of this base, as the commercial potential
 is significant.
 "This partnership is a significant step forward for both Stockholm Skavsta
 Airport and TBI plc. We see potential for passenger numbers to grow to three
 million per annum, firmly establishing Skavsta as Stockholm's second
 airport."

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES ITS NINTH EUROPEAN BASE
 SIX NEW ROUTES (30 FLIGHTS DAILY) FROM STOCKHOLM SKAVSTA
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (Tuesday, 28th January 2003)
 confirmed that it had chosen Stockholm Skavsta Airport to be its ninth
 European base.
 Starting in 9 weeks time (4th April 2003), Ryanair will allocate up to 4
 aircraft to its new base in Stockholm, operating over 30 flights each day
 from Stockholm on 6 new international routes to Aarhus, Glasgow, Hamburg,
 Paris, Oslo and Tampere (Finland) - in addition to the hugely successful
 existing routes to London and Frankfurt.
 This new Scandinavian base will result in the creation of over 200 new jobs
 in Stockholm and will result in over 1.5 million passengers being carried
 through Stockholm Skavsta in the first year of this new base. These
 passengers will save over SEK 3 billion compared with the high fares
 currently being charged by SAS, Scandinavia's high fares airline.
 As well as announcing details of its routes, Ryanair also announced launch
 air fares from just SEK 299! Ryanair's one way fares will be at least 84%
 cheaper than the one way fares currently offered by SAS.

 Announcing details of the 4th Continental European base in Stockholm today,
 Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
 "Thanks to Ryanair, and Stockholm Skavsta Airport, the SAS high fares
 monopoly in the Scandinavian market is at an end. Ryanair are breaking
 the monopoly of SAS in the Scandinavian markets of Norway, Finland,
 Sweden and Denmark - with choice and low fares which will save consumers
 over 85% on the SAS high fares. For years, visitors to Stockholm and
 Swedish consumers have had to put up with SAS's high air fares, but this
 monopoly ends on 4th April 2003.
 "Now there will be a choice of air fares and daily scheduled flights not
 only to London and Frankfurt, but also to Oslo, Glasgow, Aarhus, Paris,
 Tampere and Hamburg - and guaranteed at the lowest air fares - 85%
 saving on the high fares charged by SAS. These fares are only available
 at Europe's largest travel website, www.ryanair.com, and we would urge
 people to book early as seats at these prices will sell out quickly.
 "These routes will be operated by 4 of Ryanair's brand new Boeing
 737-800 aircraft, and recruitment and training will shortly get underway
 of 100 people in time for the base launch on 4th April 2003.
 "Our passenger numbers have grown rapidly at Stockholm Skavsta Airport
 since we began flying in June 1997. With these new routes and our base
 investment, traffic growth at Stockholm Skavsta Airport will explode".
 Welcoming Ryanair's announcement of Stockholm Skavsta Airport as its new
 base, Dot Gade Kulovuori, Manager Director of Skavsta Airport said:
 "Ryanair have been firm supporters of Stockholm Skavsta Airport for 5
 years, and together we have seen passenger numbers increase year on
 year.
 "We are delighted that Ryanair share our ambitious plans for Stockholm
 Skavsta and today's announcement and the new routes, will bring even
 greater choice and low fares to the people of Stockholm, as well as
 benefiting the local economy with in coming visitors and jobs."

 STATEMENT ON DECEMBER 2002
 TRAFFIC GROWTH
 Ryanair, Europe's only low fares airline today published passenger numbers
 for December'02 which were 64% higher than the same month last year.
 In a statement accompanying the traffic figures Ryanair's Chief Executive,
 Michael O'Leary said;
 "I want to re-emphasise what was predicted in my interim statement of 4
 Nov'02 which was that rapid traffic growth was planned in Q3 and Q4 as a
REG- Ryanair Holdings PLC
 direct consequence of "significantly lower" air fares and yields.
 "This strong traffic growth in December (which will continue into January)
 was a deliberate by-product of a number of lower fare initiatives including;
 - the 870,000 free seat give-away in Q3 which has reduced yields
 as expected,
 -the successful launch of four new routes from our Frankfurt
 Hahn base in early December which improved the traffic
 growth, but at lower introductory fares,
 -continuing strong growth across the existing network as a result of
 Ryanair's policy of driving down air fares, in order to widen the price gap
 between us and all of our competitors in every market.
 "Our business continues to grow as forecast, therefore this traffic growth
 in December does not give rise to any change - positive or negative - to our
 previous guidance."
