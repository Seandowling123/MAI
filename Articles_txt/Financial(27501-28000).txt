Highlight: Irish no-frills airline Ryanair said all the flights to Romania's Arad airport have been cancelled due to the 
failure of the County Council and its president, Iosif Matula to sign and honour its agreement with Ryanair.
Body
Irish no-frills airline Ryanair said all the flights to Romania's Arad airport have been cancelled due to the failure of 
the County Council and its president, Iosif Matula to sign and honour its agreement with Ryanair.
Ryanair said it will replace the Arad service with a three times weekly service from Bergamo in Italy to Berlin 
Schoenefeld.
The company said it had been looking forward to carrying 50,000 passengers in the first year of operations to the 
Arad region.
 The budget carrier said, based on the short-lived success of the three flights per week it was running to Arad - 
which started in April - it had been considering expanding services from the Airport but now all plans for additional 
flights have been cancelled.

The Dublin slumped by 2.39pc today with the ISEQ's banking stocks giving up most of their gains and Irish food 
company shares suffering from poor sales reports from the UK.
The index closed 134.07 points lower at 5,485.77.
London's FTSE closed well down last night and Wall Street was again lower after new figures showed inflation 
rising due to the impact of high energy prices.
 Worries also continued about the credit crisis, contributing to a fall in the Dow of more than 100 points. Food firms 
fell sharply with Kerry down 31c to E19.00, Greencore fell by 16c to E2.93 and Fyffes declined by 3c to E0.67 after 
the UK's third biggest supermarket group and a big seller of Irish foodstuffs, J Sainsbury, posted weaker quarterly 
sales. Banks, as usual, suffered from the air of uncertainty over interest rates and the property markets in Ireland 
and the UK with AIB shares dropping by 45c to E10.75, Bank of Ireland fell by 29c to E6.69, Anglo Irish declined by 
17c to E7.00 and Irish Life and Permanent slumped by 24c to E9.11. Irish Life and Permanent is due to update the 
market later today with a first-half pre-close trading statement. Goodbody is forecasting operating earnings per 
share of 178.4 cent for the full year, operating pre-tax profits of E545.5m and a 5pc hike in the dividend to 78.75 
cent. "We are slightly ahead of consensus, though in the detail, we are lower on banking profits, but higher on life 
assurance profits," according to Goodbody Stockbrokers analyst, Eamonn Hughes. "Bear in mind, in 2009, we are 
below consensus. So what are we expecting tomorrow? On the life side, we are forecasting a 5pc decline in new 
business sales for the full year. Relative to our current assumptions, recent market trends drive us to suspect that 
new Retail sales could be lower than anticipated, but corporate better, so while the mix may change somewhat, we 
anticipate our overall new business sales volume is ballpark," he added. Elsewhere, shares in Ireland's largest plc, 
CRH, slumped by 50c to E18.80. The US architectural billings index (ABI), a lead indicator of future non-residential 
construction activity, fell slightly in May to 43.4 from 45.5 in April. The index continues to indicate that non-
ISEQ loses 2.39pc as banks, food falls
residential construction activity will slow in the first half of 2009 in the Irish firm's biggest single market. Shares in 
Ryanair continued to fall with the stock down 4c to E3.15. EU regulators have started a formal investigation into 
alleged German subsidies for the Frankfurt-Hahn airport. The EU said yesterday that the alleged aid came through 
fee agreements between the airport and Ryanair starting in 1999. Shares in Aer Lingus also fell by 4c to e1.60. 
Shares in Dublin-based pharmaceutical trials firm, Icon, surged after it said that its board of directors has 
recommended a bonus share issue. The company said the move was designed to increase the liquidity and 
marketability of the stock. Each shareholder will receive one new ordinary share for every one existing ordinary 
share held of record on August 8, 2008. The move sent shares in the firm surging on the Irish Stock Exchange 
today. Shares in Icon surged by nearly 8pc or E3.50 per share to E47.50 each.

ESB seeks price hike of  30pc - report

Body
News In Brief
## The ESB is looking for a 30pc increase in the price of electricity which - if granted -- would add about 45 euro to 
the average two-monthly bill and push the average bill for a year to more than 1,100 euro. The Irish Independent 
understands the ESB is looking for the increase because the surge in oil prices has driven up the cost of generating 
electricity. The increase needs to be sanctioned by the independent Commission for Energy Regulation. However, 
in the past it has shaved only an average of just 3pc-4pc off such requests. - Irish Independent
## The aviation regulator received a 190,000 euro cheque from Ryanair last week as payment for legal costs 
accumulated from court actions lost or not pursued by the low-cost airline. - Irish Times 
 ## Patrick Neary, chief executive of the Financial Regulator, has warned the banking sector that they need to be 
very clear about the incentives paid to executives and why. They have a duty to question policies and to interrogate 
sources of profit to ensure that risk is well understood and managed, he says. "The key challenge for all institutions 
is to develop a culture within their organisations that fosters compliance and high ethical standards," he said. In that 
context, referring to the unease caused by Contracts for Difference, known as CFDs in the markets, Mr Neary said 
this was an area where change was needed. - Irish Examiner ## Ireland's telecoms industry saw revenue drop for 
the first time in two years during the last quarter, to 1.12bn euro, as mobile operators felt the pinch from increased 
competition and the introduction of price caps by the EU on roaming charges. In its quarterly survey released 
yesterday, telecoms watchdog ComReg said that, based on the fall in revenue, Ireland's electronic communications 
network and service providers can expect to generate annualised revenues of 4.46bn euro this year. It added that 
while fixed-line and broadcasting revenues increased over the last quarter, mobile revenues "declined significantly" 
by over 7pc. - Irish Independent ## RTE director general Cathal Goan was paid 441,000 euro last year, an increase 
of 22 per cent on his previous year's remuneration, according to the national broadcaster's 2007 annual report. - 
ESB seeks price hike of  30pc - report
Irish Times ## THE European Commission has launched an investigation into possible state aid at Ryanair's third 
largest base, Frankfurt Hahn The probe is the first to be launched into a Ryanair base since the Commission fined 
the airline 3m euro for state aid breaches at Charleroi Airport in 2004. Since the Charleroi judgement, the EC has 
launched seven probes into smaller European airports used by Ryanair for a handful of flights. Yesterday's Hahn 
move marks the first time the EC has taken aim at a major piece of Ryanair's network since Charleroi. - Irish 
Independent ## Ryanair's chief executive expects oil to fall below USD 100 a barrel by the end of next year - after 
hitting a high of USD 150. Ryanair is largely un-hedged for fuel-price increases in the current fiscal year through 
March 2009, and Michael O'Leary declined to buy hedging agreements for fuel in February, when oil was at about 
USD 90 a barrel, saying he expected the price to fall below USD 80. Oil is now trading at USD 133 a barrel, almost 
double the price last year. - Irish Examiner

(ANSA) - Rimini, June 17 - Irish low-cost air carrier Ryanair has introduced a flight from Rimini, central Italy, to 
London.
The flight between Rimini's Federico Fellini airport and London's Stansted will be carried out three times a week, on 
Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
Ryanair already operates other two flights from Rimini - to East Midlands airport in Nottingham, the UK, and to 
Stockholm.
The ticket prices for the new route will start from 10 euro ($15.499).
As ANSA reported on May 7, 2008, Ryanair expects to carry 14 million passengers in Italy in 2008. In 2007, 
Ryanair transported a total 12.7 million passengers and in the period between 1998 and 2007 it serviced 60 million 
passengers in Italy. The Italian market is the second largest for the company, generating a total 12 pct of the 
passenger traffic of Ryaniar. A total 88 pct of the flights of the company were punctual, Ryanair said. The rate of 
luggage lost by Ryanair stands at 0.6 per 1,000 passengers compared to 17 per 1,000 passengers for Italy's flag 
carrier Alitalia and 28 per 1,000 passengers for British Airways.
Ryanair started operating in Italy in May 1998 with the flight connecting Treviso, in northern Italy, to London.

The European Commission said it will formally investigate public funding which the Hessen and Rheinland-Pfalz 
regional authorities gave to Frankfurt Hahn airport.
As part of the investigation it will also look at its parent company, Fraport AG, and the airport charges and individual 
contracts concluded with Ireland's Ryanair.
The Commission investigation follows complaints from a competing airline and from an association of airlines.
The Commission investigation relates to two capital increases, which took place in 2002 and 2004, as well as a 
profit-and-loss transfer agreement, between the airport and Fraport, and an individual contract with Ryanair.
The Commission believes Flughafen Frankfurt Hahn GmbH might have acted like a private market investor, but 
that, at this stage, there is insufficient evidence to show this beyond reasonable doubt; the commission is therefore 
inviting interested parties, including the German government, to give their views.

Notebook (Brian Groom): This is one I have been avoiding but I cannot let the opportunity pass. Ireland's No to 
the Lisbon treaty provides the perfect excuse to give you my 10 greatest Irish people, viewed from an FT 
perspective. Given its tortured history, every choice is potentially loaded.
As in previous lists, those who qualify were born there and have made their mark on politics, business or 
economics. I cannot take the easy way out by choosing St Patrick, born near Carlisle. No writers or musicians 
either. And I have ignored the north-south border.
1. Charles Stewart Parnell (politician, born Avondale, Co Wicklow). Protestant landowner who set 19th-century 
Ireland on course towards land reform and home rule. Were it not for his divorce and early death, could 
independence have come earlier and with less bloodshed?
2. Michael Collins (revolutionary leader, born Clonakilty, Co Cork). Created the Irish Free State in 1922 by 
agreement with Britain, at the cost of civil war in Ireland.
3. Edward Carson (Ulster Unionist leader, born Dublin). Secured exemption from home rule for Northern Ireland but 
warned Unionist leaders not to alienate northern Catholics.
4. Charles Haughey (prime minister, born Castlebar, Co Mayo). Here for one reason alone: in his third term (1987-
1992) he finally adopted the tax and spending cuts that set Ireland on track to become the Celtic tiger.
5. Jack Lynch (prime minister, born Cork). Led Ireland into the European Economic Community in 1973 - one of the 
best things ever to happen to the country, in spite of last week's vote.
6. Mary Robinson (former president, born Ballina, Co Mayo). Human rights champion who revitalised the 
presidency.
7. Michael O'Leary (businessman, born near Mullingar, Co Westmeath). Built Ryanair into Europe's largest low-cost 
airline.
8. Arthur Guinness (brewer, born Celbridge, Co Kildare). Founded the Guinness business.
The great Irish
9. Tony O'Reilly (billionaire, born Dublin). Head of a media empire and former chief executive of HJ Heinz.
10. Seán Quinn (entrepreneur, born Derrylin, Co Fermanagh). Ireland's richest man; his cement-to-financial 
services empire spans the border.
The eagle-eyed will note that I have excluded Éamon de Valera, leader of the independence struggle, three-times 
prime minister and later president. He was a hugely significant figure but under his guidance Ireland turned into a 
backward theocracy with a stagnant economy.

No-frills airline, Ryanair, today opened its twenty fifth hub in Birmingham and announced nine new European 
routes.
The new routes are from Alicante, Derry, Fuerteventura, Katowice, Kaunas, Krakow, Palma, Malaga and Murcia 
and will begin in October 2008.
Ryanair's Bridget Dowling said: "There's a double celebration at Birmingham International Airport this week. We're 
celebrating the arrival of our first based aircraft here and we're also announcing a further 9 new routes which go on 
sale today. With 32 low fare routes announced from Birmingham to date, people of the West Midlands no longer 
have to suffer BA high fares or their high fuel surcharges."
 "By 2012 , Ryanair's will have five aircraft based in Birmingham, which will deliver 5M passengers p. a. sustaining 
5,000 jobs. This will equate to £400 million visitor spend for theWest Midlands. While other airlines, like BA, are 
busy increasing fares and fuel surcharges, Ryanair is guaranteeing the lowest fares and no fuel surcharges," she 
said.

The ISEQ index see-sawed in and out of negative territory before adding to Friday's rout as surging oil sank airline 
shares and amid rising prospects for an ECB rate hike next month increase.
The index closed 54.85 points lower at 5,571.30.
An upward revision of eurozone HICP inflation to a record 3.7pc in May has increased the likelihood that the ECB 
will raise rates by 0.25pc at its next policy meeting in July. The 12-month inflation rate reached the highest level 
since the launch of the euro back in 1999, and surpassed a first estimate of 3.6pc provided by Eurostat at the end 
of last month. The May figure was up from 3.3pc in April. 
 Banking shares put in a mixed performance with AIB up 2c to E11.23, Bank of Ireland dropped by 22c to E6.81 
while Anglo Irish gained 11c to E7.07 and Irish Life and Permanent climbed by 11c to E9.63. Across the water, in 
an announcement this morning, Barclays has responded to media and market speculation regarding a possible 
capital raising. It confirms that a possible issuance of new equity by way of a placing and pre-emptive offer to 
existing shareholders is "currently under active consideration". Market commentary suggests that Barclays is 
seeking to raise £4bn. Meanwhile, Irish Life and Permanent will issue its pre-close trading statement on Thursday. 
In a better-than-feared interim management statement on May 1st, IPM said that 'outside of significant changes in 
conditions', group operating earnings should be broadly in line with the mean consensus operating EPS estimate, 
which it put at 182c at the time. "It looks like this has since drifted back to around 171c as the Irish economy 
continues to weaken," said Davy analyst, Emer Lang. Meanwhile, crude oil futures climbed towards a record 
USD140 a barrel as investors focused on a weaker dollar. Light, sweet crude for July delivery soared to a trading 
record of USD139.89 before retreating to trade up USD3.33 at USD138.19 a barrel on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange. Many investors buy commodities such as oil as a hedge against inflation when the dollar falls. Also, a 
weaker dollar makes oil less expensive to investors dealing in other currencies. Many analysts believe the dollar's 
ISEQ slumps as oil prices surge
protracted decline is a major factor behind oil's doubling in price over the past year. Aer Lingus shares gained 7c to 
E1.57 while Ryanair slumped by 15c to E3.10. Shares in food companies also slumped with Kerry Group down 50c 
to E19.60 and Fyffes tumbled by 4c to E0.70, both hit by the surging cost of fuel for transport. Following last week's 
trading statement from Independent News and Media, in which it indicated that it was difficult to forecast full-year 
profits given the uncertainty in markets, Davy has formally adjusted its forecasts downwards by 6pc. Shares in the 
Indo group rose by 4c to E1.96, nevertheless. An article in the Lex column of the FT this morning outlines that 
annual traffic growth in the airline industry will decline this year. In Q1, global traffic growth was 4pc, down from 8pc 
the previous year. "This trend is likely to continue, especially if oil prices remain at present levels," said Goodbody's 
analyst, Eamonn hughes.

The alluring attraction of Abruzzo
The alluring attraction of Abruzzo
Sunday Business Post

Italy's Abruzzo region offers national parks, fine wines and affordable properties, writes Susan Campbell.
It is tempting for anyone selling property in Italy to declare their region ''the new Tuscany''. Umbria, Marche and 
Puglia have all been marketed in these terms over the past couple of years, luring investors with the promise of 
realistic prices.
Now it's the turn of Abruzzo, birthplace of the Italic tribes from whom the country took its name. But the tired 
comparison does the region a disservice, as first impressions suggest it has enough merit to stand alone in the 
desirability stakes.
Located in central Italy, directly east of Rome, Abruzzo is connected to the capital by a motorway through the 
Apennine mountain range, which gives the region much of its drama, character and beauty. One third of its area is 
a national nature reserve, with no fewer than four national parks, which are home to golden eagles, brown bears 
and wolves.
Hilltop towns, olive trees and vineyards abound, together with fine cuisine and the familiar Montepulciano and 
Trebbiano wines. While the Adriatic coastline provides blue flag beaches, there are also a good number of ski 
resorts to extend the holiday season, and a sprinkling of golf courses.
Abruzzo embraces four provinces: L'Aquila, Pescara, Chieti and Teramo. The coastal town of Pescara, capital of 
the province which takes its name, has its own airport, with low-cost flights from London with Ryanair. This and 
Rome Ciampino, a couple of hours away and also served by Ryanair, are the closest access points.
According to Philippa Pignat of Chesterton International, prices are between 40 and 70 per cent lower than in 
Tuscany. ''Chesterton wanted to have an alternative to Tuscany for buyers who have high expectations of a 
renovated product but can't afford what they want," she said.
The alluring attraction of Abruzzo
The firm's client, Italy Dream Houses, is an indigenous firm specialising in renovation projects. One of these is in a 
hamlet two kilometres from Tocco da Casauria, a small town situated on the lower slopes of Mount Morrone, thirty 
minutes from Pescara.
It is a semi-detached, three-storey house dating from the 1900s, which is available for conversion into three two-
bedroom apartments with between 55 and 95 square metres of space. Located on the edge of a small piazza, the 
property has impressive views and a 100 square metre garden with fig and olive trees.
Each apartment will have a balcony, courtyard or garden and will be sold freehold for between  135,000 and  
220,000.There is also the option of securing the entire house for  450,000 to  500,000.
An artist's impressions show what is achievable - period features such as brick vaulted ceilings, wooden beams, 
fireplaces and antique cotto floors will be preserved, while the promised finish is of a high standard.
The apartments will come furnished, each with a private entrance. Also close to Tocco is the Villa Patrizia, a 145 
square metre rural farmhouse on a peaceful plot of 1,300 square metres. Already renovated, it is for sale for  
360,000 and offers accommodation over three levels including a two-car garage, with the option of an 8 by 7 metre 
swimming pool at an additional cost of  20,000 to  30,000.
Italy Dream Houses (IDH) is also planning to renovate neighbouring semi-detached houses in the town of Molina 
Aterna, which has a nice piazza and overlooks a picturesque valley. They will be converted into five two-bedroom 
apartments, ranging from54 to 90 square metres with outside space, and priced at  110,000 to  190,000 furnished.
These and other IDH properties are available on a staged payment basis. According to Chesterton, Italian 
developers must take insurance for the value of a property to cover any risk that it may not be completed, while 
purchasers are protected legally from defects of construction for ten years once they have moved in.
A little further south on Lago da Scanno, a picturesque lake surrounded by mountains, lies a different investment 
proposition. Due to an historical precedent, permission has been granted for a restrained development, Residenza 
Tassido Coda which, according to Lucio Forgione, of agent Overseas Homesearch, offers a unique opportunity to 
acquire a lakeside property with the option of guaranteed rental.
''To be able to build a new complex near the shore of such a protected lake is unheard of," he said. There are a few 
buildings dotted around the lake, but these are generally unobtrusive. Situated 900 metres above sea level, the 
development will comprise a small four-star hotel and seventy apartments, each with lake views and a balcony, 
garden or terrace.
Studio, one, two and three-bed apartments, ranging in size from 30 to over 100 square metres are available priced 
at between  100,674 and  373,181.
Building has already commenced and the completion date is the end of 2009. The structures are reinforced with 
steel to comply with anti-earthquake requirements, and employ materials such as stone and terracotta tiles.
Each apartment will have a parking space, cellar, underfloor heating, fitted kitchen, bath/shower room and 
satellite/cable connections.
There will be access to a private beach, restaurant, spa, swimming pool, tennis courts and an amphitheatre (for 
music and ice skating), and while additional charges may apply, reduced rates of 15 to 30 per cent apply to those 
opting for guaranteed rental.
Situated a short hop from the medieval town of Scanno and walking distance of Villalago, Tassido Coda is well 
placed for sampling local cuisine and crafts. The development is also on the edge of two national parks, with the 
Mount Rotondo ski lift nearby and the Passo Godi resort within reach for downhill and cross-country skiing. The 
coast is an hour's drive away.
The alluring attraction of Abruzzo
The 12-year guaranteed rental agreement is optional, but encouraged through incentives. These include a 
comprehensive furniture package and five weeks' use a year (plus two weekends, subject to availability), with free 
electricity, water, gas, sewerage, heating/air conditioning and hot water.
Purchase, again, is via staged payments. As all of the above properties are available off-plan, Vat should be in the 
region of 10 per cent. The notary fee will be an agreed percentage of the declared value of property, while the 
solicitor's fee should be around  1,000 to  2,000.
Prospective buyers should also checkout insurance costs, as Abruzzo, in common with the rest of Italy, is a seismic 
area. Where rental is involved, it may also be necessary to employ an Italian accountant to handle tax liabilities.

EasyJet may close German base
EasyJet may close German base

Consultation starts with pilots and crew
Dortmund site under review
Body
EasyJet is expected to close its operating base at Dortmund in Germany later this year, the first time either the UK 
low-cost carrier or Ryanair, its Irish rival, has closed part of their extensive network of European bases.
The UK airline said yesterday it had begun a 90-day consultation with its pilots and cabin crew in Dortmund about 
restructuring the base, including the option of closure and serving Dortmund routes from other bases.
The expected withdrawal from Dortmund comes only three years after the airport was established as EasyJet's 
second base in Germany - after Berlin-Schönefeld - and follows its failure to meet the group's financial targets.
It is a further sign of the way the surge in fuel costs is tightening the squeeze on airlines' least- profitable operations 
forcing many carriers to reduce capacity and ground aircraft. Ryanair warned recently that it was planning to ground 
about 20 aircraft or 10 per cent of its fleet during the coming winter season.
EasyJet said its problems in reaching an acceptable level of profitability in Dortmund had been exacerbated by the 
early 10pm night-time curfew on operations, which had eroded its competitiveness.
The German airport had the most stringent operating hours of any of its crew bases, which had hampered its ability 
fully to utilise its aircraft. It had failed in repeated efforts to extend the operating hours.
EasyJet had already reduced the number of aircraft located in Dortmund from four to three last summer and the 
airline said the base was too small "in the context of today's oil price" to provide the economies of scale and 
crewing efficiency needed to support a low-cost operation.
It said in spite of substantial marketing investment in Dortmund, it had not been possible to offset its cost 
disadvantages, which had been exacerbated by the recent increase in the price of oil.
EasyJet may close German base
EasyJet currently operates 11 routes to and from Dortmund and this is expected to be halved in the coming winter 
season.
The UK airline said it was pleased with the progress of its Berlin base, but in Dortmund it had suffered from tough 
competition from the large number of neighbouring airports including Cologne-Bonn, the main base of 
Germanwings, the rival German low-cost carrier, and Düsseldorf.
EasyJet currently has a network of 20 bases including 11 in the UK and nine in continental Europe.
Its biggest base is London Gatwick with 35 aircraft, where it has expanded quickly this year through the takeover of 
GB Airways.

Low cost airline easyJet Plc said it is starting a 90 day consultation with its staff over whether to close its Dortmund 
staff base. The UK-based carrier has also said it will cut about half of all flights from the city in its winter schedule.
The airline said in a statement it was considering the closure because of the operating schedule at the airport. 
There are a total of 116 easyJet employees currently based at Dortmund.
'Dortmund airport has the most stringent operating hours of any easyJet crew base which significantly hampers 
aircraft utilisation, eroding easyJet's competitiveness in Dortmund,' it said.
'As a result, easyJet has just three aircraft based at Dortmund which, in the context of today's oil price, is insufficient 
to provide the economies of scale and crewing efficiency necessary to support a low-cost operation.'
In reaction, rival low-cast carrier Ryanair Holdings, which also operates flights from the area, said in a statement it 
has released 100,000 seats at 10 euros including taxes and fees on its 22 routes from Dusseldorf-Weeze, which is 
80km outside of Dusseldorf, to celebrate the easyJet decision.

European shares fell for a fifth successive day yesterday as investors took profits on metals and mining and oil 
stocks, while banks recovered some lost ground.
"There is room for a 10 to 15 per cent downward correction in commodities stocks and we are advising investors to 
take some money off the table," said Philippe Gijsels, senior equities strategist at Fortis Global Markets.
"Governments are increasingly concerned about inflation so there will be moves to combat speculation in 
commodities such as increasing margins," he added. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.7 per cent to 1,271.24 points, 
dipping to its lowest level in 10 weeks, and taking the fall from its May highs to 8 per cent. The decline in oil and gas 
stocks was triggered by a drop in the price of crude, which fell below $134 a barrel. Investors used the fall in the oil 
price, which recovered later, as a signal to take profits.
France's Total fell 1.3 per cent to EUR53.99, Norway's StatoilHydro  fell 1.5 per cent to NKr193.20, Italy's Eni  fell 
2.4 per cent to EUR25.09 while Portugal's Galp Energia  fell 0.7 per cent to EUR16.19.
Oilfield services companies fell in tandem with producers. Italy's Saipem lost 4.1 per cent to EUR28.26 while 
France's Technip shed 2.8 per cent to EUR59.24.
The falling oil price was good news for airlines, which rose after two days of losses. Irish budget carrier Ryanair 
was up 3.6 per cent to EUR3.00, Deutsche Lufthansa  added 0.5 per cent to EUR15.71 and Air France-KLM  
gained 1.6 per cent to EUR16.34.
Back in the commodities sector, steel companies lost their appeal with Germany's ThyssenKrupp down 3.7 per 
cent to EUR41.83 and Sweden's SSAB 2.8 per cent lower at SKr205. In France, ArcelorMittal  lost 2.8 per cent to 
EUR64.39, while steel tubemaker Vallourec fell 3.6 per cent to EUR199.17.
Belgo-Dutch Fortis  sagged 3.8 per cent to EUR13.82 after Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation on the financial-
services company from "buy" to "neutral", citing concern over the bank's leveraged position.

Businesses engaged in tourism in Co Clare and the Shannon region were warned today that they must collaborate 
or the industry will die off.
The Shannon Tourism Co-operative (STC) claims that the region must engage in a more collaborative approach to 
marketing the sector if it is to develop during a period of economic uncertainty spurred on by rising fuel prices and 
an increasingly weakened US dollar.
The newly established group says that not enough is being done to attract and retain visitors to the area as they 
pass through Shannon Airport.
 According to Councillor Sean McLoughlin, Mayor of Shannon, "Of the estimated 3 million transit passengers using 
the airport annually comparatively few are fully aware of what the Shannon area and County Clare have to offer the 
short stay visitor." He added, "Many who book with Ryanair and other carriers immediately head for the big centres 
such as Limerick, Killarney and Galway. The only way of reversing this trend is by pooling local resources and 
marketing efforts of tourism interests in the area." Mayor McLoughlin continued, "The Co-operative's aim is to make 
sure visitors planning to use the airport are aware of the area's attractions and, secondly, to start building the area 
as a destination. By establishing a cooperative, we can share experiences and marketing budgets, along with 
bringing the collective strength of all the area businesses to bear in developing this potentially lucrative market."

Irish shares followed European stock markets lower and continued its steep fall after record declines on Wall Street 
on Friday.
By midday, the ISEQ was down 74.71 points to 5,732.13.
Europe's bourses reported results that weighed heavily on the already-pressured banking sector.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.5pc at 1,278.13 points. Banks were the worst 
drag on the index, accounting for a net decline of over 3 points, compared with a net decline of 1.9 points just 
before the results. Lehman said it expected a second-quarter per-share loss of USD5.14, compared with Reuters 
estimates for a loss of USD0.38 per share. Back in Dublin, surging oil prices were again on investors minds. The 
dollar's weakness has led to a renewed spike that abated only slightly this morning amid profit taking. It is also no 
help for equities that none of the major central banks are cutting interest rates, analysts say. "Apart from financials, 
equities have had a decent run recently on healthier credit markets. But if oil keeps going up, that will not continue," 
said Rossa White of Davy Research. Shares in Ryanair plummeted with the shares down nearly 5pc or 15c to 
E2.87 as investors worry that it may not even break even this year if crude oil prices continue to surge. Davy has 
now downgraded Aer Lingus earnings for the full year 2009 after already lowering its forecast earnings per share for 
Ryanair. "The driver of these downgrades is of course the oil price," said analyst Stephen Furlong. "Timing 
differences on hedging positions will mean that some airlines take the hit to earnings in 2008, but eventually all 
companies will be impacted. We believe that in general the long-haul, and particularly transatlantic, airlines will be 
worst affected, having limited ability to pass through fuel price increases," he said. Aer Lingus shares rose by 1c to 
E1.57. Banks continued to spiral downwards. Shares in AIB dropped by 9c to E11.95, Bank of Ireland declined by 
4c to E6.96, Anglo Irish was flat at E7.50 while Irish Life and Permanent fell by 11c to E9.95. Last week proved one 
of the worst for UK and Irish banks in the current bear market. UK banks lost 7.4pc, led by Bradford and Bingley (-

20pc), while Irish banks lost 10pc, led by Bank of Ireland (-14pc). This leaves the UK and Irish sectors off 42pc and 
28pc respectively year-to-date, putting them in second and sixth worst place in Davy's European/US bank universe. 
Over one year, UK banks are now the worst performers, down 62pc, with Irish banks in third worst position, down 
50pc. IAWS helped to limit the ISEQ fall somewhat. Its shares climbed by 72c to E16.90 after it confirmed this 
morning that it has agreed to merge with its Swiss peer Hiestand. The proposed deal will create a new company 
called Aryzta, which will be incorporated in Switzerland.

Rising air fares to affect home owners abroad
Rising air fares to affect home owners abroad

Rising oil prices are set to impact on access to holiday home destinations.
Those with even a passing interest in the news will no doubt be aware of the bloodbath predicted for the world 
aviation industry. As global fuel prices surge at an unprecedented rate, it is impossible to ignore the fact that fuel 
costs are now astronomical and growing rapidly.
This is a nightmare scenario for the aviation industry. The International Air Transport Association has forecast an 
industry loss of $2.3 billion for 2008 based on an oil price of $106.50, and has warned of the potential for a $6.1 
billion loss if oil stays at $135 per barrel for the rest of the year.
The pressure is already taking its toll on a number of carriers, with American Airlines announcing recently that it is 
to cut routes and jobs because of rising oil costs. Last week, Europe's most profitable airline, Ryanair, said that its 
profits had fallen by 10 per cent year-on-year due to rising fuel costs and the dramatically decreased value of its 
stake in Aer Lingus.
While the firm said it was likely to break even in the current fiscal year, it predicted an average fare rise of 5 per 
cent. Working on very low operating costs leaves Ryanair more exposed to oil price increases than most, and it is 
estimated that every $1 increase in the price of oil adds about  14 million to its cost base annually.
''I hope oil does stay at $125 or $130 a barrel during winter because I think that it will bankrupt half of the airlines 
flying today, in which case we'll still be the lowest-fares airline in Europe," said Michael O'Leary, chief executive of 
Ryanair. ''But our fares won't be  40 a passenger, they might be a little bit higher."
British Airways also expects fares to rise. A spokesman for the company said that it believed ''the current situation 
will result in the end of the cut price fares to which travellers have become accustomed in recent years''.
Rising air fares to affect home owners abroad
While this is bad news for all travellers, it will be particularly difficult for many owners of holiday homes abroad. 
Rising flight costs will be a difficult pill to swallow for anyone who purchased a property based on the availability of 
cheap flights and access to specific routes from airports close to them.
Whatever happens to the price of oil in the medium to long term, it certainly doesn't look as if flight access is going 
to get any cheaper in the short term. So if it costs you a lot of money to get to your chosen destination at the 
moment, you can expect it to get a whole lot more expensive before the end of the year.
The ballooning price of oil highlights another significant problem for overseas homeowners - how do you get to your 
property if the flight route on which you were dependent is suddenly discontinued?
We have seen exponential growth in the availability of routes from all Irish airports, but most of these new routes 
have been provided by Ryanair. The chances of all of them being profitable are very small, particularly under 
current economic conditions.
Routes that exist today may well be gone tomorrow, a fact underlined in no uncertain terms by O'Leary a couple of 
years ago when he said that Ryanair did not have any obligation to second home owners.
''Please don't ask me to feel sorry for rich people with second homes in France," he said.
British Airways has said that it planned to reduce capacity by not replacing older aircraft as they came to the end of 
their lease periods. The oil price spike has also resulted in the firm passing fuel surcharges on to passengers; the 
firm said it would continue to monitor the situation and that further fare increases might follow.
Some overseas property agents are already taking steps to counteract the effects of reduced access and higher air 
fares.
Orlando-based developer Gary Kenny said his firm was working on attracting more US buyers. Karen O'Reilly, who 
is based in the Languedoc region of France, which has blossomed with the arrival of low-cost carriers, said she was 
also seeing more French people moving to the region and was now targeting this market.
Both Kenny and O'Reilly said that while investors were slow to commit to overseas purchases at the moment, 
lifestyle buyers were still in evidence, albeit at a lower rate than before. Both also feel that long-haul destinations 
will suffer most.
''I would be confident that carriers such as Ryanair can ride out the storm and continue to bring customers to the 
Languedoc are a,' ' said O'Reilly.
The routes most likely to be affected by the shake-up in the airline sector are those to long-haul destinations such 
as the United Arab Emirates and US cities, particularly those on the west coast.
You should also be worried if flights to your chosen destination are departing only half full, as airlines will not be 
able to sustain routes that don't reach at least 80 per cent capacity. This will put smaller regional airports, which 
struggle to fill planes, at a severe disadvantage.
Travellers should, at the very least, expect to pay more for their flights than they do currently.
You can also expect to see a raft of new initiatives to glean more money from passengers, such as increased fuel 
surcharges, fees for extra legroom seats at exits, mobile telephony on-board and advertising initiatives both within 
and outside the cabin.

The scare campaign will start this weekend. Ireland will be relegated to the periphery of Europe if we vote No.
We will lose our negotiating strength. Europe will be in chaos. Europe won't be able to respond to climate change or 
secure our energy future. Crime gangs will take over. Europe won't be able to respond to terrorism. Democracy will 
be set back in Europe. Our fundamental rights will go unprotected.
The rest of Europe - all 620 million people - won't speak to us any more, won't serve us in restaurants or bars, won't 
fly Ryanair, won't visit Ireland. We will be expelled from the Eurovision and Uefa. Brian Cowen will have to sit at the 
servants' table next time there is a Euro summit.
The reality is that this Lisbon Treaty does not matter. Europe can do fine without it, as it has done over the last four 
years - and this has been one of the major problems for the Yes side in this campaign.
Had this arisen more than four years ago, before the accession of the raft of new member states that joined on May 
1, 2004, the case for change would have been far more plausible. It was then credible that EU institutions would be 
unable to cope with 25member states, with a voting procedure and a commission designed, in the main, for the 
original six members. Most of us would have bought the argument that institutional change was an imperative.
But now, four years on, after the EU has done just fine with the existing structures, the argument for institutional 
change is gone - or, at least, is far weaker. There is no imperative. The trump card the Yes side would then have 
had has now gone.
The stuff about climate change is, frankly, a lie. The Lisbon Treaty makes not a jot of difference to the ability of the 
EU to deal with climate change and the Yes side know that. The stuff about our energy future being secured is also 
vastly overblown. As for the crime gangs and all that, there is no argument at all about that, for Ireland has chosen 
to opt out of this part of the treaty, so that makes no difference to us. The rest of them can go ahead with 
cooperation on crime, policing or security as much as they like, with or without the treaty.
Vote Yes to annoy the No side - or vice versa
Yes, there are modest improvements on the democracy front, in that the European Parliament would have almost 
full co-decision powers with the European Council under the treaty, and the European Council would have to act 
openly, when in its legislative mode. There is also the involvement by the national parliaments of the EU, with some 
powers to hold up measures if enough of them agree. But this is, for the most part, make believe, and we are not 
much worse off without this.
Dick Roche said on a radio programme last week that Europe would be ''infinitely'' more democratic as a 
consequence of these measures. Get a life, Dick.
The co-decision mechanism, insofar as it exists at the moment, has proved largely perfunctory. The European 
Council still largely does what it likes. As for the European Council operating in public when acting as a legislature: 
bunkum. The European Council will do all the deals it needs to do behind closed doors and will then go through the 
formalities of voting in public, along the lines previously agreed in secret. The European Council remains the barrier 
to democracy within the EU, although Euro fans persist in denying this.
The EU is essentially an intergovernmental institution, which allows governments to do things under the guise of the 
European Council which, individually, they would not get away with. Because of its 'all-in-together' nature, that 
remains undisturbed under this treaty, nothing has been done about this core obstacle to democracy in the EU. 
Euro fans call this the ''democratic deficit'', which is a nice little harmless phrase, to convey what is essentially a 
cancerous deficiency.
The only way of dealing with this is to deepen the federal nature of the EU, and the very thought of this drives the 
Eurosceptics mad - or, rather, madder. By the way, John McCarthy from Michelstown (or somewhere around there) 
is organising a Mad Pride weekend soon, to help remove the stigma from mental illness. The Eurosceptics and the 
Euro fans should go to this en masse - not that, come to think of it, that would do much to remove the stigma from 
mental illness.
Anyway, the problem for the Yes side is that there aren't any really strong arguments for voting Yes, other than that 
a large number of important people in Europe, maybe 240 of them, will be seriously pissed off for at least a few 
days if we vote No. The reason they will be pissed off will not so much be that anything of any consequence was 
defeated, but that their will has been thwarted. It was for this very reason that they colluded to deprive the 
electorates of other countries a say on this treaty but, because of the initiative of the late Raymond Crotty in this 
country many years ago, that ruse does not work here - although the establishment hoped it would.
So, if you care about these important people being pissed off, vote Yes. If you could not care less, pay no attention 
to the admonishments about all hell breaking lose if the Lisbon Treaty is defeated by the ungrateful Irish, and feel 
free to vote No.
But also feel free to vote Yes just to annoy the people on the No side, who deserve to be annoyed. (And, of course, 
vice versa.)

Banks 
It was a turbulent week for Bradford & Bingley, which sent shockwaves through the banking sector when it was 
forced to renegotiate its £300m rights issue, after the shares threatened to sink beneath the subscription price. A 
profit warning also caused it to bring in private equity group TPG as a 23 per cent investor. Rod Kent, chairman, 
took on executive responsibilities after Steven Crawshaw, former chief executive, resigned last weekend on health 
grounds.
The negative sentiment also weighed on HBOS. The UK's biggest mortgage lender will complete its £4bn capital 
raising in mid-July. Analysts said the success of its rights issue would depend partly on take-up from retail 
shareholders and that the stock could also be hurt by housing market concerns.
The Office of Fair Trading raided the Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays in the latest example of the 
competition watchdog's hardline approach to possible price-fixing. It has in the past two years imposed heavier 
fines and used tougher legal powers that allow it to threaten executives with up to five years in jail.
Telecoms 
Vodafone would receive no dividend from its stake in Verizon Wireless until 2012 at the earliest after the US 
wireless carrier's $28bn (£14bn) acquisition of rival Alltel. It also emerged that it is seeking control of Vodacom , 
South Africa's largest mobile phone operator, by making an informal offer of $2.5bn for a 12.5 per cent stake.
The new chief executive of Orange UK , the country's third-largest mobile operator, set a target for it to become the 
market leader by 2012. Tom Alexander, who took over in January, announced a strategy that targets having the 
largest number of customers in the UK within four years.
Oil & Gas 
The Week
Robert Dudley, head of TNK-BP , BP's Russian joint venture, was summoned for questioning by the interior 
ministry as part of an investigation into tax evasion. Tony Hayward, BP chief executive, told Rosneft , Russia's 
state- controlled oil company, that it must respect property rights and the rule of law.
Aerospace 
US authorities investigating allegations of corruption at BAE Systems issued a subpoena on another of the 
defence contractor's executives. Alan Garwood, business development director, who was previously in charge of 
export sales at the Ministry of Defence, became the third senior executive to be served papers in relation to the 
Department of Justice's investigation of the £43bn al-Yamamah arms deal between Saudi Arabia and the UK in 
1985.
Travel & Leisure 
There were further warnings from low-cost airlines this week. Andy Harrison, chief executive of EasyJet , 
maintained the sharp rise in fuel costs would drive weaker carriers into liquidation. Meanwhile, Ryanair said 
operating profits would be wiped out this year if the price of oil remained at $130 a barrel.
Mining 
The chief executive of BHP Billiton expressed confidence that the Anglo-Australian miner's $180bn (£92bn) bid for 
Rio Tinto would be passed by the European regulator. They were Marius Kloppers' first public comments since 
BHP submitted its proposed hostile takeover of Rio to the European Commission amid calls from the steel industry 
for the deal to be blocked on competition grounds.
Food Retailers 
The continuing success of Wm Morrison 's "optimisation plan" helped the food retailer get off to a strong start to its 
financial year, with first-quarter sales up 7 per cent on a like-for-like basis, beating the rest of the food retailing 
sector. Marc Bolland, chief executive, said customers were not showing signs of trading down in their shopping.
Tesco , the UK supermarket group trying to make headway in the US, came under fresh attack from UFCW, a 
powerful US trade union, which accused it of operating double standards. It sent representatives to London to 
launch a campaign with Jon Cruddas, the leftwing Labour MP, for union recognition at Tesco's US Fresh & Easy 
chain.
Food Producers 
Associated British Foods  plans to expand its "healthy" eating interests by merging its Ryvita crispbread business 
with W Jordan & Sons, the breakfast cereal and snacks group. In the cashless merger of Ryvita and Jordan, ABF 
will end up with 62 per cent of the enlarged company.
General Retailers 
Kingfisher , owner of the B&Q home improvement chain, warned it was still braced for the full impact of a 
depressed UK housing market even as it reported falling sales.

Irish airline Aer Lingus gives warning
Irish airline Aer Lingus gives warning

Aer Lingus PLC warned its shareholders Friday that record-high fuel prices could drive the Irish airline into the red 
this year and would require at least one U.S. route to be suspended.
"Based on current fuel prices and the uncertain economic outlook, we expect, at best, to break even for the year 
2008," Chairman John Sharman said in a statement to the airline's annual general meeting at a north Dublin hotel.
Sharman said the airline would suspend its services to Los Angeles in November and would keep other long-haul 
routes to U.S. cities under review a stunning U-turn following its launch earlier this year of new routes to San 
Francisco, Washington and Orlando, Florida.
He called the shutdown of the Los Angeles service "a direct consequence of the unprecedented increases in fuel 
costs, the weak U.S. dollar and slowing economies."
Shares in Aer Lingus which the government floated on the Irish and British stock exchanges in September 2006 fell 
to a record low of 1.53 euros ($2.41) after Sharman's statement, but rebounded slightly to close down 4.5 percent 
at 1.56 euros ($2.46).
Aer Lingus also published its May passenger figures. It said 23.9 percent of its seats went unsold last month, up 
more than four percentage points over the previous year. The figures were worst on U.S. routes, where 28.8 
percent of seats were empty, up 7.8 points.
The airline emphasized, however, that ticket sales were up 10.4 percent overall because of its rapid expansion of 
routes over the past year.
Aer Lingus' biggest challenge comes from its long-running showdown with its own employees, who constitute the 
company's third-largest shareholder after rival airline Ryanair and the Irish government.
The company blocked planned pay rises in October to half of its work force because unions rejected a blueprint for 
shaving 20 million euros ($31.5 million) annually in labor costs.
Irish airline Aer Lingus gives warning
Sharman said Friday he expected to achieve the planned savings in full this year. But the biggest union, SIPTU, 
has warned it will strike if the airline imposes its plans without agreement.

The unprecedented cost of fuel and the difficult operating environment are continuing to have a significant negative 
impact on the financial performance of Aer Lingus, chairman John Sharman, told shareholders at its AGM today.
Mr Sharman said that Aer Lingus, like its rival Ryanair last week, will find it hard to break even given the relentless 
rise in fuel costs.
He said the current environment of record high fuel prices, coupled with slowing economic growth globally, is 
presenting the entire aviation sector with unprecedented challenges from which Aer Lingus is not immune.
 He added that, in the face of 'strong headwinds' from surging oil prices, Aer Lingus plans to axe its Los Angeles 
route and cut long haul capacity but that it can still deliver on its promise to cut costs by over E20m this year. "Aer 
Lingus is committed to its medium term long haul growth strategy. However, at a time of unprecedented high fuel 
prices, and uncertain economic conditions, we will continue to focus on actively managing our capacity and reduce 
our operating costs," he said. He added that the airline has decided not to increase its long-haul fleet as planned 
next year. "The board remains confident that the Company's medium term growth plans remain on track. Aer Lingus 
has a strong balance sheet with net cash at the year-end amounting to E757.0m and a strong management team to 
manage its business through the current period of uncertainty and deliver on its medium term objectives," he said. 
"A key element of the Company's cost reduction programme is third party maintenance arrangements. With the 
current contracts expiring in October 2008, the Company agreed terms, subject to contract, with a number of world-
class suppliers, which will allow the Company to reduce its maintenance costs by at least E20m in 2009 and 
annually thereafter," he said.

Airlines were hit by the soaring cost of oil with share prices lower in early trading after the commodity put on more 
than $6 in two days.
The impact of higher crude for July delivery prices, which wrtr at $128 a barreltoday,was clear to see as bothBritish 
Airways PLC (BAY) and easyJet PLC (EZJ) topped the loser boards in the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 respectively.
At 09:58am in a rising market BA was down 4.4%, 11.25p lowerat 243p, while EasyJet was also weaker by 5.2%, at 
316p having shed 17.25p.
The falls reveal the perilous position the airlines find themselves in as they attempt to cope in a world with higher oil 
prices, and come despite numerous airlines growing passenger numbers in the Spring season..
Budget airline EasyJetis the latest to reveal a gain, announcing passenger numbers had grown to3.9 million 
passengersin May, up15.9% year-on-year.
It's competitor Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA) saidearlier in the week that it had increased passenger traffic by 22% in 
May to 5.06 million.
However there are signs that some airlines are starting to feel the pinch, with British Airways (BA)reporting a slight 
fall of 0.6% in numbers to 2.82 million.
Referring to EasyJet, brokerCredit Suisse said the May traffic figures for were 'broadly encouraging'. However, in an 
indictment of the whole sector, it added that strong forward bookings and reasonable average fareswould not save 
the industry from the impact of higher fuel costs.

Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings Plc. said it has launched 12 new UK routes as part of a package of 40 new 
European routes for winter 2008.
Ryanair said the new routes include seven low fare routes from London Luton to Beziers, Derry, Kaunas, Rzeszow, 
Szczecin (Poland) and Trapani (Sicily) and from London Stansted to Madrid.
The other new routes are from Bristol to Gdansk, Marrakesh and Szczecin, from Birmingham to Frankfurt and from 
Manchester to Brussels, the low-fare airline said.
These 40 new routes will ensure passenger savings of 150 million pounds compared to the fares of flag carriers, 
Ryanair said.

Andy Harrison, chief executive of EasyJet, warned yesterday that the sharp rise in fuel costs would drive weaker 
carriers into   liquidation.
The airline industry is "facing dramatic changes towards the end of the summer season and during the winter, if oil 
prices are sustained at current levels", he said in a speech to the UK aviation club.
His remarks follow similar warnings this week by Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, the leading low cost 
airline in Europe.
Ryanair said its operating profits would be wiped out this year, if the crude oil price remained about $130 a barrel, 
despite making record underlying profits last year.
Weaker airlines operating older aircraft would be forced out of business, Mr Harrison said. He dismissed recent 
statements from some traditional carriers that the no-frills airlines were most in danger from the surge in fuel prices, 
and said it was "rubbish" to forecast the end of the low-cost sector.
"Darwinian principles will triumph," he said, "the strong will get stronger and the weak will disappear." There would 
be a change in the balance of the industry, he said, with long-haul carriers hit most and leisure travellers choosing 
shorter-haul destinations for holidays in response to rising fares.
EasyJet, with a strong balance sheet and cash reserves and one of the youngest fleets in Europe, would "win out in 
an environment of sustained high oil prices", he said.
Mr Harrison called for rules to be introduced in the European Union to set minimum emissions standards for aircraft. 
He also backed calls for a break-up of BAA, the UK airports operator, which is being investigated by the 
Competition Commission.

EC Set To Open Formal Probe on Italy Govt Loan to Alitalia

Body
(ANSA) - Brussels, June 5 - The European Commission (EC) prepares to open a formal inquiry into the 300 mln 
euro ($461.8 mln) Italy extended as a bridge loan to ailing flag carrier Alitalia to assess whether it was state aid 
which violates EU regulations.
The issue is expected to be discussed by the European Commission session on June 11, 2008, EU sources said. 
The proposal will be presented by the newly-appointed European Commissioner for Transport, Antonio Tajani.
The launch of an in-depth inquiry has become necessary after the explanation provided by the Italian Government 
on May 30, 2008 was not sufficient to dispel the doubts of the EC on the loan, the sources said.
Officially the EC provided no comment on the issue on June 4, 2008. After the EC completes the analysis currently 
under way, it will take and announce its decision, EC spokesman, Johannes Laitenberger, said.
However, experts consider the in-depth inquiry is an obligatory way both to take into consideration the protests filed 
by Alitalia competitors, mostly British Airways and Ryanair, and to assess whether the loan extended was state aid. 
The inquiry may last up to a maximum of 18 months, thus Italy will have time to submit its observations and explain 
in details why the loan should not be considered state aid, the sources said. 
Even if Brussels rules the loan is state aid, Italy is expected to manage the Alitalia dossier without tangible damage, 
the experts said, listing as an example Greece's Olympic Airways. The EC decided in December 2002 that the 
Greek state must recover 160 mln euro ($246.3 mln) in aid illegally granted to Olympic, but the decision has 
remained a dead letter so far. Only a second ruling by the European Court of Justice could lead to fines. The EC is 
not believed to be orientated to follow the path of immediate injunction proceedings at Italy to suspend the aid 
granted to Alitalia. This is because currently the main prerequisite for this procedure is lacking, that is, the aid to 
Alitalia to cause a serious and irreversible damage which puts at risks the survival of a competitor, sources in 
Brussels said.

Oil prices may be hurting, but the likes of Ryanair argue their business model will weather turbulence, writes 
Amanda Vermeulen
Body
Michael O'Leary was at his bombastic best yesterday, insisting Ryanair's business model would prosper - not suffer 
- in an era of determinedly high oil prices.
The Ryanair chief executive told reporters: "In this industry, the lowest-cost operator always wins. The era of low-
cost travel is not over - it is the era of high-cost travel that is over."
His comments followed the announcement of robust figures for the year to the end of March. He admitted life would 
be tough this year if oil prices do not retreat, with "at best" break-even for 2008-09. But he struck a defiant tone on 
the long-term viability of the low-cost airline model.
Mr O'Leary's bluster is at odds with the International Air Transport Association, the body that represents legacy 
airlines and has been holding its annual conference in Istanbul this week.
IATA argues that at an estimated average of $107 per barrel for 2008, fuel will account for 37 per cent of airlines' 
total operating costs - hitting the likes of Ryanair disproportionately hard. "Logically, it [fuel] represents more for the 
lowcost carriers - up to 50 per cent - so logically, those most affected will be the low-cost carriers," the association 
said.
Ryanair's main UK rival, EasyjJet, says IATA's position is not borne out by reality: "IATA is the club of legacy 
airlines, so it has a vested interest [in the demise of low-cost carriers]."
EasyJet maintains that the survival of any airline will not hinge on its business model, but rather its balance sheet. 
In evidence, it points to three recent airline collapses; Eos, Maxjet and Silverjet, all of which were aimed at the 
business travel market.
Low-cost airlines remain defiant
JPMorgan aviation analyst Chris Avery believes there is no question that some of the low-cost carriers can survive 
the current rough patch. He suggests that Ryanair and Easyjet have strong enough balance sheets to see them 
through, as do some legacy operators, such as BA,   Air France and Lufthansa.
But even the strongest are taking tough measures to stave off the worst effects of the oil price. Ryanair plans to 
ground 10 per cent of its fleet - or 20 jets. A basket of cut-backs will hopefully yield a 2 or 3 per cent reduction in 
costs, Mr O'Leary says. BA has indicated it will stop flying some of its most unprofitable jets and Easyjet is 
disposing of 10 aircraft.
The silver lining for the surviving airlines will be the consolidation benefits. If the oil price returns to more 
manageable levels, they will be able to cherry-pick the best routes and assets of rivals that do not make it.

'Operating profits could be wiped out'
Body
Ryanair, the leading European low-cost airline, has warned operating profits will be wiped out this year if the crude 
oil price remains at about $130 a barrel.
After record underlying profits last year Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said the airline would only break even this 
year at current fuel prices.
Fares would increase and the group was planning to ground up to 20 aircraft or about 10 per cent of its capacity 
during the winter.
High airport charges and oil prices meant losses would be reduced by cutting flights and grounding aircraft during 
winter, when fares were at their lowest levels.
Ryanair profits last year were hit by a EUR91.6m (£72.3m) write-down on its controversial 29.2 per cent stake in 
Aer Lingus, the rival Irish carrier, where it failed in a full takeover bid.
Pre-tax profits fell 2.7 per cent to EUR438.9m. Excluding exceptional items, net profits increased last year by 20 per 
cent to EUR480.9m. Turnover rose by 21 per cent to EUR2.7bn, while passenger numbers rose 20 per cent to 
50.9m.
Ryanair has announced a pay freeze, cut jobs at its Dublin call centre, renegotiated airport maintenance and 
handling contracts, and increased charges for baggage and check-in.
Mr O'Leary forecast Ryanair's average fares would rise by about 5 per cent this year.
Ryanair shares, which have nearly halved in the past year, rose 5 per cent to EUR2.85, as investors welcomed 
plans to pass on costs to consumers.
Ryanair warns amid soaring cost of fuel
The group is supported by fare increases being imposed by rival airlines through fuel surcharges.
Mr O'Leary predicted many European airlines would "consolidate or go bust, a development we believe is inevitable 
if oil prices remain above $100 this winter".
He said the group, which entered this summer essentially without protective hedging of its fuel requirements, did not 
believe oil prices of $130 a barrel were sustainable over the medium term but "equally we don't know when they are 
going to fall".
Ryanair's gamble on oil prices falling and its decision not to hedge has left it as one of the most exposed large 
carriers in Europe to the full force of fuel price increases this summer.

European retailers led the Continent's bourses higher as broker comments sparked a broad-based recovery in the 
sector.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.8 per cent to 1,329.07 points, shrugging off Monday's losses. Shares got a further 
boost from unexpectedly positive US factory data, which eased fears of a US recession.
French grocery retailers Carrefour and Casino Guichard   received a shot in the arm from ING.
The broker initiated coverage of both stocks, with a "buy" recommendation and a EUR57 price target on Carrefour 
and a "hold" rating together with a price target of EUR86 on Casino.
ING said the pair would benefit from their exposure to high-growth markets. Carrefour rose 3.1 per cent to 
EUR45.38 and Casino added 1.1 per cent to EUR82.07.
Supermarket gains lit a fire under the whole sector with French group PPR   up 2.9 per cent to EUR85.40, Spain's 
Inditex rising 4.1 per cent to EUR32.23 and Sweden's Hennes & Mauritz up 1.2 per cent to SKr330.50.
European banks remained under pressure. Irish lenders were the latest to feel the effects of nervous European 
markets after the battering received by British banks on Monday when Bradford & Bingley warned on profit and 
lowered the price its rights issue.
Bank of Ireland fell 8.2 per cent to EUR7.48, Anglo Irish Bank shed 7.9 per cent to EUR7.73 and Allied Irish Banks   
lost 2.5 per cent to EUR12.58.
All three were playing catch-up with Monday's losses in the sector after Ireland's bourse was closed for a public 
holiday.
UBS   , the Swiss bank and one of Europe's worst casualties of the credit crunch, rose 3.8 per cent to SFr25.20, 
supported by comments from ratings agency Standard & Poor's.
ING provides shot in arm for retailers
"We expect UBS to return to profitability in the remainder of 2008, notwithstanding the potential for further 
writedowns," said S&P analyst Richard Barnes.
In Ireland, no-frills airline group Ryanair   climbed 5.4 per cent to EUR2.85 after a better than expected 20 per cent 
rise in full-year net profit.
It warned that it expected to only break even in the current year if crude oil prices stayed near $130 a barrel.
Nevertheless, Numis raised its rating on the stock. Analyst Wyn Ellis said: "We believe sentiment for airline stocks 
will bottom in the autumn and, after recent share price weakness, our recommendation moves to 'hold' from 
'reduce'."
Citigroup was even more upbeat. "We expect many of Ryanair's competitors to fail or scale back at current oil 
prices, making Ryanair an eventual winner from industry upheaval."
Shares in Italian internet provider Tiscali were up 10.1 per cent to EUR2.58 after reports that Vodafone, of the UK, 
was to make an offer for its Italian and UK assets. The mobile phone group was reported to be offering about 
EUR2.80 a share, valuing Tiscali at EUR1.6bn.
German potash maker K&S   raised its full-year profit forecast for the second time in three weeks thanks to soaring 
fertiliser prices and tight supplies of potash.
Its shares rose 3.6 per cent to EUR316.16 after the company said pre-tax profit was now expected to hit EUR1.1bn.
On May 14, K&S reported a doubling in quarterly profit and forecast its annual earnings would nearly triple to 
EUR850m.
In the German company's wake, Norwegian fertiliser company Yara International  rose 5.3 per cent to NKr407.50.
Shares in Belgian brewer InBev   hit an 18-month low on continued concern that a potential takeover of Anheuser-
Busch could be costly. InBev shares fell 2.4 per cent to EUR45.8.

The budget airline market has for some time resembled something of a street brawl. So if Ryanair is to suffer a 
bloody nose in the coming year - Michael O'Leary, chief executive, expects only to break even with oil prices at 
$130 per barrel - it may be time to start worrying what the other guys will look like. We have heard dire predictions 
pass unfulfilled before, from Mr O'Leary himself back in 2004. There were failures, but their places were quickly 
taken by other start-ups. Yet this time round, with aircraft financing conditions much tougher and economic growth 
weakening, widespread pain looks inevitable. On Monday, the industry body, IATA, cut its forecast for airline 
earnings in 2008 from a profit of $4.5bn to a loss of $2.3bn, based on the average oil price so far this year of $105. 
The US airlines bear the brunt of this, but every $1 rise in the average oil price will cost the industry a further 
$1.6bn. Capacity has to fall, and even Ryanair plans to ground a 10th of its fleet when demand sags in the winter 
months - more than twice as many as last year. Small carriers that are yet to make a profit seem unlikely to survive.
However, predictions for the death of the low-cost model look premature. Business cost-cutting, consumers trading 
down from long-haul to short-haul trips and greater consumer sensitivity to fares should help support demand for 
the cheapest tickets. Rising fuel surcharges at flag carriers also provide cover to raise budget fares - Ryanair 
expects prices to be up by 5 per cent this summer.
New routes and cheap tickets will continue to stimulate passenger growth. With the most efficient cost structure of 
any European airline and a strong balance sheet, the Irish operator can ride out the downturn. It remains the least 
bad choice in a terrible industry.

No Ryanair briefing is complete without chief executive Michael O'Leary having a gratuitous swipe at his 
adversaries. The Irishman was on his usual form yesterday when talking about the BAA airports monopoly and the 
"level of idiocy" of those regulating the airline industry, referring to them as "half wits". Mr O'Leary expects oil prices 
to fall, although he admits he doesn't have a clue when. He predicted Ryanair would break even if oil remained at 
$130 a barrel, but "the rest of the industry will blow their brains out".

Budget airline leader Ryanair Holdings PLC reported a 10.3 percent drop in net profits Tuesday, citing the record 
cost of fuel and its attempt to take over Irish rival Aer Lingus.
Chief Financial Officer Frank Millar said Ryanair would ground 20 aircraft about a tenth of its fleet during lowest-
demand winter months. The airline kept seven jets idle at its biggest hub, Stansted Airport northeast of London, last 
winter.
For the year ending March 31, Ryanair said its net profit fell to 390.7 million euros ($608.7 million) from 435.6 
million euros the previous year. The carrier reported an exceptional 91.6 million euro ($142.7 million) loss from the 
sliding shares of Aer Lingus, in which Ryanair has built a 29.2 percent stake.
Ryanair sales rose 21 percent to 2.71 billion euros ($4.22 billion), reflecting the company's continued aggressive 
rollout of new routes and hubs. But operating costs rose 23 percent to 2.17 billion euros ($3.38 billion), led by a 14 
percent rise in fuel costs to 791.3 million euros ($1.23 billion).
And Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the airline expected only to break even in fiscal 2009 if the cost of fuel 
doesn't fall well below its current "irrational" prices near $130 a barrel.
Nonetheless, O'Leary said Ryanair would exploit the fuel crisis to build its status as Europe's biggest no-frills 
carrier. He predicted that competitors would face bankruptcy and collapse this winter if oil doesn't go below $100 a 
barrel.
He said Ryanair would "continue to grow by lowering fares, taking market share from competitors, and expanding in 
markets where competitors either withdraw capacity or go bust. We believe that our earnings will rebound strongly 
when oil prices settle down, as we believe they will."
Analysts and investors broadly agreed. Ryanair shares bucked a negative market to rise 5.2 percent to 2.84 euros 
($4.14). Aer Lingus, by contrast, fell 2.9 percent.
Ryanair profits fall on fuel costs, takeover bid
Ryanair said its cash reserves over the past year slipped 1.3 percent to 2.17 billion euros ($3.38 billion), while its 
debts surged 21.7 percent to nearly 2.27 billion euros.
Key expenditures included 937.1 million euros ($1.46 billion) to buy new Boeing aircraft, 300 million euros ($467.4 
million) to buy back 3.8 percent of Ryanair's own shares, and 58.1 million euros ($90.5 million) to accumulate Aer 
Lingus shares.
O'Leary said the company remains determined eventually to acquire Aer Lingus, even though European Union 
competition authorities have rejected its proposals and Aer Lingus' two other major shareholders the Irish 
government and employee-controlled trusts oppose the bid.
Ryanair said it employs 5,900 people today operating more than 650 routes in 26 countries. The airline was 
founded in 1985, when it operated a single route linking Ireland and England.

Leading shares were higher midmorning, with Royal Bank of Scotland leading a revival for some the banks battered 
in recent days.
At 10:05 a.m., the FTSE 100 index was 15.2 points ahead at 6,022.8, compared with a high for the session of 
6,039.0 and a low of 5,993.3. The FTSE 250 index was 25.7 points up at 9,954.0.
'It seems the banking boys have rescued the FTSE after the sell off Monday. The banks have taken such a 
battering over the past year with Bradford & Bingley down around 80 percent for the year and other banks 50 
percent lower, there comes a point where valuations start to look good again,' said Mark Priest, head of equity sales 
at Tradindex.
Banking stocks were recovering from recent losses as investors went bargain hunting following Monday's sharp 
declines, triggered by the profit warning and revised equity offering at midcap Bradford & Bingley.
Royal Bank of Scotland topped the FTSE 100 leaderboard, up 9 at 235, bouncing from its lowest in several years 
amid continued doubts about its 12 billion pounds rights issue.
Lloyds TSB was 6-3/4 higher at 384. Bradford & Bingley topped the FTSE 250, up 3 at 70.
Some retailers were also bouncing following recent weakness, notably B&Q parent Kingfisher, up 1.9 at 136. 
Kingfisher reports first-quarter numbers Wednesday.
Oil services group AMEC was up 24-1/2 at a record 873 after it announced a deal with BP.
And, UK natural gas producer BG Group gained 23 at 1,264 after it announced it has signed two liquefied natural 
gas agreements with Brazil's Petrobras.
However, other oils were under pressure following, with crude prices slipping back a little this morning. Brent for 
July was trading at $127.64 a barrel midmorning, down 38 cents.
BP was down 3 at 601-1/4 and Royal Dutch Shell fell back 9 to 2,124.
Some miners were also lower with one trader noting profit taking following their recent rally.
Rio Tinto was off 38 at 6,132, Vedanta Resources was down 56 at 2,449.

In the FTSE 250, easyJet was 5 higher at 290-1/2 after rival budget airline Ryanair Holdings announced a full-year 
adjusted profit after tax of 480.9 million euros compared to 401.4 million euros the previous year.
Media group Informa was up 14 at 383, benefiting from JP Morgan initiating coverage following the bank's merger 
with Bear Stearns. JP Morgan named Informa as one of its top picks in the sector with an 'overweight' rating and 
525 pence price target, pointing to its strong revenue streams.
On the downside, Electrocomponents fell back 2-3/4 at 165-1/4 as Goldman Sachs cut its price target on the group 
to 192 pence, from 236, while also cutting the time horizon for that target to six months, from 12 months, but

The Dublin market slumped today as investors sold off banking stocks in bulk as a major UK bank warned on the 
state of the UK economy and worries that the credit crisis is far from over yet.
UK bank Bradford and Bingley issued a stark warning on the state of the UK mortgage market yesterday and 
slashed the price of its emergency fundraising to secure a private equity lifeline, hitting bank shares across Europe.
The news added to renewed concerns about the financial sector, which also sent Wall Street shares tumbling on 
Monday night. A newspaper report saying that US giant Lehman Brothers may need to raise more capital added to 
fears that the credit crisis is back and has unsettled financial markets. 
 Irish bank shares took a hammering with AIB sliding by 45c to E12.45, Bank of Ireland declined by 59c to E7.56, 
Anglo Irish was down 62c to E7.78 and Irish Life and Permanent fell by 61c to E10.64. Davy Research noted that, 
while banking stocks dived, the rest of the European market has performed reasonably well. That trend is likely to 
continue, spurred by US avoidance of recession, the resilience of the developing world and the resultant pick-up in 
risk appetite. It noted that the UK has been a key focus from the Irish perspective: Bradford and Bingley delivered 
an expected profit warning yet the stock tanked again when it decided to attempt to renegotiate its rights issue. 
Ryanair was the other main focus of investor attention yesterday after it delivered its full-year set of results. While 
surging fuel prices will result in a break-even for Ryanair next year, the group's hold on costs means it will be a 
winner in the long term, according to Davy Research. The Irish no-frills airline reported a 20pc increase in after tax 
profits for the year to the end of March. After tax profits rose to almost E481m from E401m the previous year, while 
revenues rose by 21pc to E2.714 billion. However, the airline warned that if oil prices stay at around USD130 a 
barrel it would expect to only break even in the year ahead. It said that the over-riding concern for airlines, 
passengers and investors currently is the 'irrational price of oil'. In a assessment of the results, Davy said the 
airline's sensitivity to every dollar per barrel in fuel cost rise is around E13m in fuel costs and E25m for every 1pc

change in yields. "While Ryanair's average fare (E43.7) is very low and it expects variable fares to fall, a significant 
portion of this is now made up of fixed charges (bag charge etc) which will help reported fares," according to 
analyst, Stephen Furlong. Ryanair shares jumped by 16c or close to 6pc to E2.86. Aer Lingus stocks fell by 8c to 
E1.60. Elsewhere, US construction spending fell 0.4pc) in April compared to March to a seasonally adjusted 
annualised rate of USD1,120.9bn. While the data were marginally ahead of Wall Street's estimate, US construction 
stocks generally fell in overnight trade. CRH, which generates over half of its total revenues from the US, fell by 26c 
to E23.44.

UK small caps remained lower at midday, tracking the downward trend in the wider market, with Brightside a major 
casualty on the back of disappointing full year results and news of a share placing.
At 12.09 p.m., the FTSE Small Cap index was 7.8 points lower at 3,114.4, while the FTSE 100 was down 9.8 points 
ahead at 5,997.8.
Brightside was down 10-1/2 pence at 24 by midday, after the company disclosed sharply higher full-year losses, the 
proposed acquisitions of Group Direct, Aust Holdings and Injury QED, and a placing of 55.8 million shares at 19 
pence a share.
Full-year losses clipped 1-1/4 pence from Forbidden Technologies, at 7 pence, while marketing support services 
group Delling slipped 0.25 of a penny to 3.125 pence for the same reason.
Protherics headed south, driving 3-1/4 pence lower to 37-3/4, as it announced pretax losses of 17.2 million pounds, 
mainly due to increase spending on research and development.
Newfound had 2 pence shaved from its share price, standing at 7-1/2 pence, as news of plans to raise 15 million 
pounds through guaranteed secured notes offset reports of the company narrowing its 2007 full-year operating loss.
Traders turned away from Avanti Screenmedia, dropping 1/2 a penny to 2-1/4, on confirmation it has secured 
commitments worth 175,000 pounds by way of an issue of a convertible loan, and has restructured 119,250 pounds 
of existing short-term liabilities into convertible loans.
Vigilant Technology shares fell 0.38 of a penny to 1.625 as investors digested news it is actively working to raise a 
further 1.5 million to 2 million pounds to provide working capital for the company and to strengthen its balance 
sheet.
Novera Energy softened 11-3/4 pence to 83-1/2 pence after the company said it is no longer in an 'offer period' 
following announcements made by both 3i Infrastructure Ltd.'s Harrier Acquisitions and Infinis Acquisitions.
Nexus Management consolidated morning gains, up 0.16 pence to 0.925, on news the IT services company's 
partner, PD Financial, has signed a 10-year deal with a leading U.S. issuer of private label credit cards with an 
initial line of $300 million.
UK small caps lower midday; Brightside down on disappointing FY & placing
Ryanair lifted 0.26 pence to 2.89 after the group issued in-line full-year results but said it will reduce capacity and 
hopes to be able to pass costs onto customers in the coming year.
Numis Securities offered support when it upgraded its view on the low-cost airline to 'hold' from 'reduce' today.
Results news and a positive outlook helped push Sepura up 5-1/2 pence to 92-1/2, whilst improved profits spurred 
on Hogg Robinson shares, up 2 pence at 43.
Mediterranean Oil & Gas climbed 9-1/2 pence to 185 pence as the company's 100 percent-owned Ombrina Mare oil 
and gas field, off the coast of Italy, was confirmed as a discovery.
Minerva Resources firmed 1/4 a penny to 3-3/4 pence following news that recent drilling at its Tulu Kapi gold project 
in Ethiopia has found high-grade mineralisation.
Furthermore, drilling at the adjacent Gudeya-Guji and Guji prospects has shown mineralised quartz veins.
Buyers came for Patagonia Gold, 1/2 a penny firmer at 10-3/4 pence, following news that drilling at the company's 
Cap-Oeste project in Argentina continues to intersect high-grade gold and silver, and the mineralised structure 
remains open at depth and along strike in both directions.
Again on an upward path, Record rose 5 pence to 91 pence after the specialist currency investment manager 
turned in more than doubled full-year pretax profits.
Better levels were also registered in Urals Energy, 6 pence higher at 194 pence, as the company said its proven 
and probable reserves grew 104 percent to 1.183 billion barrels of oil equivalent following the Taas Yuriakh 
acquisition and upgrade in reserves estimates at the Dulisma fields.
Traders warmed to Penna Consulting, 6-1/2 pence up at 99-1/2 pence, after the UK-based outplacement 
consultancy disclosed a rise in full-year pretax profits to 2 million pounds from 600,000 pounds and said all 
indications are that it 'will see a year of significant growth' going ahead.
Finally, a contract win for TT Electronics lifted its shares 3 pence to 126-1/2, after it said on Tuesday it has won 
contracts worth 8 million pounds for projects in North Africa and the Middle East, while ABN Amro repeated its 'add' 
stance in reaction.

Body
Ryanair has announced plans to ground up to 10pc of its aircraft this winter and said it would break even in 2009 if 
oil prices remain at USD130 a barrel as it unveiled a 20pc rise in adjusted profits after tax to E480.9m.
Ryanair said it would take up to 20 aircraft temporarily out of service mainly at Stansted and Dublin, where it said 
high airport charges make it more profitable to ground aircraft rather than fly them through the winter.
It said the outlook for the coming fiscal year to March 2009 remains entirely dependent on fares and fuel prices.
 'Based on forward bookings, we now believe it likely that average fares for the coming year will rise by 
approximately 5pc,' Ryanair said in a statement. 'If oil prices remain at USD130 US per barrel, then we expect to 
accordingly break even for fiscal '09.' The Dublin-based carrier said passenger numbers rose 20pc during the year 
to 50.9m. It said revenues lifted 21pc to E2.7bn from E2.24bn previously. Adjusted basic earnings per share were 
22pc higher at 31.81c per share. Ancillary revenues grew by 35pc, almost double the rate of traffic growth. The 
overriding concern for airlines, passengers and investors currently was the 'irrational' price of oil, the airline said. 
Ryanair said it did not believe oil prices at such levels were sustainable over the medium term, but said it didn't 
know when they would fall. The carrier forecast that many European airlines inevitably would consolidate or fail if oil 
prices remained above USD100 a barrel this winter. However, it said it would continue to grow by reducing fares, 
taking market share from rivals and expanding in markets where competitors either withdraw capacity or go out of 
business. 'We believe our earnings will rebound strongly when oil prices settle down as we believe they will, and in 
the interim we will take the tough decisions necessary to lower our costs in this difficult period,' Ryanair said.

### The growth rate in residential mortgage lending fell to its lowest level in 16 years in April, according to the latest 
monthly statistics from the Central Bank. 
Growth in residential mortgage lending fell to 11.4pc, the lowest annual rate of increase since May 1992, the 
Central Bank said.
The figures show that the total outstanding in residential mortgages is now E143.4bn. It also reveals that the 
amount owed in overdrafts fell by E274m last year. 
 Outstanding indebtedness on credit cards increased year on year by 7.2pc in April, down from 8.6pc in March. 
(RTE) ### Siemens, the company awarded the E40m baggage contract for Dublin Airport's second terminal, last 
night insisted its systems would not succumb to the same problems that plagued March's opening of Heathrow's 
Terminal 5. During the first five days of Terminal 5, British Airways misplaced more than 23,000 bags and check-on 
baggage was banned from scores of flights as the terminal's high-tech baggage system collapsed. The Dublin 
Airport Authority (DAA) yesterday announced it had selected German software giant Siemens to create the 
baggage system for the eagerly-awaited Terminal 2. (Irish Independent) ### Ryanair carried over 5 million 
passengers in May, the company said yesterday. The airline said that its passenger traffic rose 22pc to 5.06 million, 
compared to 4.15m in May 2007. Ryanair said that over the year it carried 52.4m passengers. (Irish Times) ### An 
increase in payment delays have put Irish firms at a higher risk of suffering cash flow problems and in danger of 
bankruptcy. This is according to a survey released yesterday which found that the average payment delay in Ireland 
has increased to 16.4 days last year from 14.3 days the previous year. The Intrum Justitia European Payment Index 
found late payments are costing European businesses over E25bn a year in additional costs. It said tougher lending 
climates are being created for businesses as a result of the credit crunch, along with higher oil and food prices. The 
average payment duration increased in Ireland, from 52.2 days to the current delay of 54 days. The study also 
found that 47pc of Irish respondents predict the risk of late payments will rise over the coming year. (Irish Examiner)

While surging fuel prices will result in a break-even for Ryanair next year, the group's hold on costs means it will be 
a winner in the long term, according to Davy Research.
The Irish no-frills airline this morning reported a 20pc increase in after tax profits for the year to the end of March. 
After tax profits rose to almost E481m from E401m the previous year, while revenues rose by 21pc to E2.714 
billion.
However, the airline warned that if oil prices stay at around USD130 a barrel it would expect to only break even in 
the year ahead. It said that the over-riding concern for airlines, passengers and investors currently is the 'irrational 
price of oil'.
 In a assessment of the results, Davy said the airline's sensitivity to every dollar per barrel in fuel cost rise is around 
E13m in fuel costs and E25m for every 1pc change in yields. "While Ryanair's average fare (E43.7) is very low and 
it expects variable fares to fall, a significant portion of this is now made up of fixed charges (bag charge etc) which 
will help reported fares," according to analyst, Stephen Furlong. Ryanair has indicated that it will ground at least 20 
aircraft this winter (approximately 10pc of the fleet) mainly at Stansted and Dublin. "As such, capacity growth should 
be around 17pc for full year 2009 versus the 20pc previously indicated. With 163 aircraft currently, we expect 
Ryanair to have around 195 aircraft by the end of next year," Mr Furlong said.

Airline websites are falling in popularity, the latest evidence that more customers are pursuing cheaper holiday 
alternatives at home this summer rather than travelling abroad.
British Airways, Easyjet and Ryanairsaw their positions among the top 20 retail websites fall in April against the 
same month last year in a league table compiled by IMRG and Hitwise, the internet monitoring organisations that 
rank companies on site visits. Expedia and Lastminute.com travel sites also tumbled.
"I think the travel industry has been declining over the last year or so," said Robin Goad, director of research at 
Hitwise. However, he pointed out that the falls could have been exaggerated by established retailers moving quickly 
up the rankings.
Amazon led the list, which compares retailers' internet site visits over the last two years, followed by Apple, 
Play.com, Tesco.com and Argos. Easyjet fell from 8th place to 10th, Ryanair from 9th to 14th and British Airways 
from 10th to 19th.
The gloomy news for the travel sector contrasts with a positive picture for overall online shopping revealed in 
another report yesterday, with Verdict Research, the retail analysis company, finding that online spending grew last 
year at its fastest rate for six years.
The finding - which is based on consumer research - will stoke hopes that internet-focused retailers or bricks-and-
mortar chains with a good online operation can avoid the worst of the incipient downturn.
Verdict found that online retail spending rose 35 per cent to £14.7bn last year, with a 5.9 per cent increase in 
internet users to 33.1m and a 24.7 per cent rise in internet shoppers to 22.6m.
Malcolm Pinkerton, analyst at Verdict, said cheaper broadband, generational shifts and better websites meant "the 
channel will find itself extremely well-placed to capitalise on the falling consumer confidence and lower levels of 
disposable income currently impacting the retail market".

Budget airline operatorRyanair posted a 20% riseinfull year profits to a record 481million (£381 million)despitethe 
soaringoil price and a 1% reduction in fare prices.
However, factoring in a 5% rise in faresthis year,the company said if oilremained at $130 per barrel it would only 
break even next year.
Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary,(above),warned that future trading was likely to become more difficult if 
fuel prices remained high.
'The outlook for the coming fiscal year remains entirely dependent on fares and fuel prices,' he said.
'Based on forward bookings, we now believe it likely that average fares for the coming year will rise by 
approximately 5% and if oil prices remain at $130 per barrel, then we expect to accordingly break even.'
O'Leary added that over the last year its hedging operation had insulated it against the worst of the price rises, and 
it intended to continue its policy of no fuel surcharges going forward.
He said: 'We will continue to absorb these higher oil costs, even if it means that our profits will fall in the short-term.'
Last winter the firm also controlled costs by grounding seven aircraft, and it said it would do the same this winter, 
grounding 10% of its fleet, mainly at cheaper airports including Stansted and Dublin.
In the wake of the results Ryanair was steeper by 8.06%, soaring 0.2125 to 2.8475 at 09:45am.
Europe's biggest low fares airline climbed after it said it had increased its full-year profits after tax by 20%, 
evenwhile trimmingaverage fares, including bag charges, by 1% to 44.
Thecompany also grew revenue by 21% to 2.7 billion, as well as increasing the number of passengers by 20% to 
50.9 million.
O'Leary said delivering record profits and traffic during a year of much higher costs was testimony to the strength of 
the business.
Broker Numis upgraded the stock to a hold, from underperform.

Fuel costs will trigger airline bankruptcy wave - easyJet German head
Fuel costs will trigger airline bankruptcy wave - easyJet German head

High fuel prices will trigger a rash of airline bankruptcies, leaving only five major carriers in Europe, the head of the 
German unit of Britain's easyJet said in an interview published Monday.
'Several airlines in Europe will go out of business,' John Kohlsatt told Berlin's daily Der Tagesspiegel. 'Theoretically, 
50 are endangered.'
Several carriers have been hit hard by rising fuel costs and are sliding into the red -- a development that in the end 
may leave only British Airways, Air France-KLM, Lufthansa, Ryanair, 'and us', Kohlsaat said.
He said easyJet would weather the storm due to its relatively low operating costs and modern, fuel-efficient fleet.
He said easyJet, currently the fourth-biggest airline in Europe, has no plans to revise its aircraft orders despite the 
high cost of fuel.
'We have ordered 119 and have options for another 88,' he said. 'We will double in size in the next five years.'
EasyJet said last month that net losses deepened in the first half of its financial year to 43.3 million pounds due to 
steep fuel costs and the takeover of GB Airways.
Record-breaking oil prices have almost doubled in the past year and have surged by more than 20 dollars since the 
start of 2008.

The toughest thing about success is that you've got to keep on being a success.
Michael O'Leary may have earned the adulation of his shareholders for transforming Ryanair from a loss-making 
sideshow to the star attraction of European aviation, but will they forgive his failure to protect the airline from the 
spike in oil prices that threatens to wipe out its profits?
Some critics would argue it's about time O'Leary made a serious mistake and ended up on the back foot, explaining 
his way out of a mess of his own creation. For the past 14 years, the Westmeath man has run Ryanair in away that 
some would envy, with dissent at a minimum and the boss largely free to do exactly as he pleased.
Fans of unconventional mould-breakers have lapped up O'Leary's style of management, however. It is difficult to 
single out the most bizarre episode of his reign.
Driving a World War II tank into Luton airport as part of a publicity stunt declaring war on rival airline Easyjet? Being 
cited by the Vatican for blasphemy following an ad campaign centred on the fourth secret of Fatima?
Delivering a shock early morning wakeup call to then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern to inform him of an audacious  1.5 
billion takeover bid for Aer Lingus, which had been part-privatised just days earlier? Or maybe incurring the wrath of 
the President of France with a (prescient) newspaper ad depicting his new girlfriend planning their wedding?
Whatever shareholders and the establishment thought of all the fun and games, they worked. O'Leary, the jeans-
wearing, free-swearing maverick, turned Ryanair into one of Ireland's biggest success stories and a world-
renowned business worth  4 billion, generating a fortune of more than  400 million for himself in the process - not 
that he keeps count.
In an interview with this newspaper in 2001, he signalled that keeping a close eye on exactly how much he was 
worth was not for him. ''At the risk of sounding like a spannerhead, you kind of stop counting after the first  50 
million'', he said. Money, he said, was just ''a handy way to keep score''.
Crude mistake
And a little more besides. Since then, he has depleted some of his points on the scoreboard bys plashing out on 
selected luxuries, such as the herd of Aberdeen Angus cattle he keeps at his Gigginstown House luxury home near 
Delvin, where he lives with his wife Anita, a banker, and their two children.
He has also dabbled in the occasional horse - including 2006 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner War of Attrition and 
Hear the Echo, this year's shock 33/1 winner of the Irish Grand National (which a ''gobsmacked'' O'Leary had not 
backed) - but has shied away from ostentatiously flaunting his wealth, instead keeping a low profile away from the 
office and the racetrack.
This week, O'Leary will report the final score for Ryanair's financial year to March. Despite record profits of over  
500 million, O'Leary will have to explain an uncharacteristic own goal that will have serious implications for the 
bottom line in the year ahead - and perhaps even beyond.
The origins of O'Leary's miscalculation go back to the latter half of 2007,when oil prices unexpectedly took off after 
they had begun to settle around the $80 per barrel mark - itself a level that seemed high in the context of a $50 to 
$60 trading range just a few months earlier.
O'Leary took a risk that the price surge would be temporary and that lower prices would be on offer once the effect 
of short-term speculation was washed out of the system.
He decided against following the usual airline industry policy of entering into long-term fuel supply deals, known as 
hedges. He could have used these to ensure that Ryanair would be able to get its hands on a decent percentage of 
its fuel requirements at a fixed price, thus shielding the airline from the full effect of future increases and giving it 
greater certainty over its future fuel bills.
Perhaps it was down to his contrary nature and a desire to be right when all others were wrong. Perhaps it was a 
result of years of refusing to pay what he considered to be over the odds for anything - from airport landing charges 
to the bargain basement  15,000 fee he paid two students for designing a website that would eventually handle 
almost all his ticket sales.
Either way, O'Leary considered hedging his fuel costs to be bad value and decided it would be better for prices to 
fall before locking in to contracts. Unfortunately for him, they did not.
What compounded O'Leary's wrong call, however, was the fact that prices not only refused to fall, but instead 
staged a fresh rally to new record highs. By the start of 2008, oil prices added another 25 per cent to begin the year 
at $100 per barrel. But the rally did not stop there, as prices continued an unrelenting march upwards, finally 
peaking last month at a whopping $135 per barrel.
The last of Ryanair's hedged fuel contracts expired in April, which means the company has been forced since then 
to pay the prevailing market rate for its fuel.
While other airlines, notably Aer Lingus, have been quick to tell their shareholders that they had engaged in astute 
hedging policies that locked in a large part of their fuel requirements when oil stood at around $80 per barrel, 
Ryanair has no such luxury.
Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion said in March that his airline had saved more than  25 million by locking 
in one third of its 2008 fuel requirements at last year's prices. O'Leary's decision will cost Ryanair much more.
In February, he shocked investors with a warning that profits could fall by up to 50 per cent in the year to March 
2009, if what he termed the ''perfect storm'' of high oil prices and flagging passenger demand came to pass.
Ryanair shares took a 13 per cent hammering on the day, but recovered quickly as the markets reflected on 
O'Leary's comments and decided they merely represented a worst-case scenario.
Crude mistake
He had also said profits could, under certain circumstances, increase by up to 6 per cent and, tellingly, announced 
plans to splash out up to  200 million buying back Ryanair shares to use up cash that the airline did not need - 
hardly a sign of an airline in trouble.
But the fact remains that Ryanair, the king of low-cost airlines, has found itself in recent weeks operating at a 
disadvantage to its rivals when it comes to fuel. It is also the second time that O'Leary has stood out from the crowd 
by deciding against hedging at what seemed unattractive prices - and calling the market wrong.
For other chief executives, playing the oil market and costing their airline substantial sums of money would raise 
serious question marks over their leadership qualities. O'Leary, however, seems immune to shareholder criticism.
Instead, he has gone on the offensive in response to the oil price spiral, telling anyone who will listen that higher 
prices maybe bad news for Ryanair but will cause far more serious damage to competitors.
O'Leary's trump card is one well worth playing. Having relentlessly stripped out unnecessary costs over such a long 
period of time, his argument goes, Ryanair's cost base is so far below even its most efficient rival that it can still 
outgun the best of them, despite the handicap of higher fuel bills.
Late last month, O'Leary told reporters that oil prices of $130 per barrel would in fact be a good thing for Ryanair in 
the long run, as they would force other airlines to the wall and improve Ryanair's competitive position.
''I've now come to the view that I hope oil does stay at $125 or $130 a barrel because I think that will bankrupt half 
of the airlines flying today," he said.
Despite admitting that he had been ''wrong about oil for the last 12 months'', he remained defiant about his gamble 
and maintained the airline would not hedge while oil prices stayed at current levels. He did admit, however, that he 
would lock in once prices dropped below $100 - something he would not have entertained last year.
But with US oil baron T Boone Pickens predicting oil prices would rise to $150 this year and investment bank 
Goldman Sachs suggesting prices could hit $200 within two years, O'Leary appears intent on gambling with 
Ryanair's bottom line while waiting for his own forecasts to be proved right.
It is a strategy that has worried some analysts. ''The recent surge in fuel prices and Ryanair's lack of material fuel 
hedging make the outlook for March 2009 extremely uncertain," investment bank Credit Suisse said in a recent note 
to clients.
The bank warned current profit forecasts might be too high, despite O'Leary's best efforts to make up for the oil 
price pressure with a series of fresh cost-cutting initiatives (which included a management pay freeze, higher 
charges for optional services such as checked baggage and priority boarding, grounding 20 planes and the closure 
of a Dublin call centre with the loss of 40 jobs).
The share price has suffered too, touching lows of  2.44 in recent weeks - its lowest level in three years, and a fall 
of some 60 per cent since reaching an all-time high a year ago.
O'Leary, however, has refused to get upset about the share price and told other shareholders that, seeing as he 
personally owns a stake of 4.4 per cent that is valued at almost  180 million, he has as much to lose as any of them 
if the markets take a dislike to his strategy.
At this stage, it appears that shareholders have known for a long time what they bought into and should not be in 
the least bit surprised by O'Leary's single-mindedness. They have also indulged him on occasions when he has 
both amazed and excelled, such as theAer Lingus takeover bid, perhaps giving him latitude that other chief 
executives would crave.
In the past, it was a small price to pay in return for his idiosyncrasies and his inspiration. But nothing so undermines 
a chief executive as a feeling that he has lost his touch.
Crude mistake
This week, O'Leary will have some explaining to do. He will need some low-cost rabbits in his no-frills hat.

Airlines gain from oil price dip

A dip in oil prices boosted airlines stocks and gave a lift to European bourses as investors shifted funds out of 
commodities stocks and into the wider market.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.3 per cent to 1,334.39 yesterday, bringing its gains over the week to 0.9 per cent. 
Relief from surging energy prices in the last two days of the week gave a fillip to other battered sectors.
"We are very close to a correction in commodities stocks," said Philippe Gijsels, senior equities strategist at Fortis 
Global Markets.
Commodities prices are set to climb over the long term, but a softening of oil stocks that make up a large portion of 
baskets of commodities shares could spark a broad-based sell-off and take the shine of metals and other 
commodities.
Airline shares flew higher with  Deutsche Lufthansa  up 7.5 per cent to EUR16.67, Air France-KLM  adding 3.2 
per cent to EUR17.19 while Irish budget carrier Ryanair gained 3.4 per cent to EUR2.72.
Tech stocks received a shot in the arm from upgrades and benefited from positive sentiment triggered by the 
decline in oil prices.
Cap Gemini was the week's biggest gainer, surging 12.4 per cent to EUR43.60, after Cazenove upgraded the IT 
services group to "in line" from "underperform", citing its "more positive view of the European IT services market".
SAP was another technology heavyweight buoyed by broker comment, rising 7 per cent to EUR35.52. 
STMicroelectronics, Europe's largest semiconductor maker, rose 4.2 per cent to EUR8.37 after Dell said PC 
shipments jumped 22 per cent.
French telecommunications giant Alcatel-Lucent  jumped 9 per cent to EUR4.86. This came as a shareholder 
meeting was convened on Friday to focus on the performance-related pay-off being negotiated for chief executive 
Pat Russo, amid speculation that she will step down.
Airlines gain from oil price dip
Alcatel shares have dropped more than 60 per cent since spring 2006 - before the ill-fated merger of France's 
Alcatel and US-based Lucent ushered in a string of profit warnings.
At the other end of the market, oil stocks weakened. Austria's  OMV  fell 4.5 per cent to EUR52.92, Portugal's Galp 
Energia  slid 5.8 per cent to EUR16.21 while Norway's StatoilHydro declined 5.9 per cent to EUR198.
French oilfield services company Technip fell 0.5 per cent to EUR60.27 and Norwegian Seadrill shed 4.6 per cent 
to EUR166.50. The Italian Saipem swam against the tide, rising 1 per cent to EUR29.52.
French bank Crédit Agricole  tumbled 7.2 per cent to EUR17.01 on talk that it would sell new shares to fund a 
EUR5.9bn rights issue in coming days.
Across the border, German main carrier Deutsche Post  dived 6.8 per cent to EUR20.45 after it joined forces with 
arch rival United Parcel Services in a $2bn rescue package for its lossmaking US unit, DHL.

Airlines and banks helped lift the ISEQ index out of the red this morning as oil prices drifted sharply lower and with 
Ryanair a top gainer ahead of its full-year results.
By midday, the ISEQ was up 30.37 points to 6,128.61.
European stocks gained ground for the third day in a row this morning, as banks rose and a drop in oil prices 
brought some relief to airline stocks.
 Air France topped European winners with a 7.7pc gain and British Airways jumped 6.3pc. Oil prices dipped to 
below USD126 today, after a steep fall in the previous session, as a rise in the dollar eclipsed the biggest drop in 
US inventories since 2004 just one week after crude prices reached an all-time high above USD135 a barrel. 
Ryanair delivers its full year results to the end of March after the holiday weekend with little that hasn't already been

investigation into Kerry's proposed purchase of Breeo Foods, for a total consideration of E165m. The initial review 
by the regulatory body was unable to conclude that the proposed transaction "will not substantially lessen

distribution of various consumer foods". Kerry's shares rose by 10c to E19.30. Independent News and Media has

Airlines and banks helped lift the ISEQ index out of the red as oil prices drifted sharply lower but then spiked again 
with Ryanair shares mirroring the see-sawing prices.
European stocks gained ground for the third day in a row as banks rose and a drop in oil prices brought some relief 
to airline stocks.
Air France topped European winners with a 7.7pc gain and British Airways jumped 6.3pc. Oil prices dipped to below 
USD126 today, after a steep fall in the previous session, as a rise in the dollar eclipsed the biggest drop in US 
inventories since 2004 just one week after crude prices reached an all-time high above USD135 a barrel.
 Ryanair delivers its full year results to the end of March after the holiday weekend with little that hasn't already 
been said expected from chief executive, Michael O'Leary. Mr O'Leary will likely again warn that profits will be hit 
severely this year but that Ryanair will emerge from the carnage of soaring oil prices and falling consumer demand 
in far better shape that most of its rivals. Shares in Ryanair jumped by 3.66pc or 10c each and Aer Lingus stocks 
rose by 5c in morning trade but then fell back in the afternoon as oil prices spiked again to finish up 1c to E2.74 and 
up 2c to E1.70 respectively. In an analyst's note, Goodbody said it expects a 20pc rise in Ryanair's revenues but a 
19pc fall in fourth quarter operating profit. It expects full-year operating profit at the airline of E529m. Banks 
recovered some of the losses they sustained over the past week but then gave up the gains again on profit taking. 
AIB shares closed down 11c to E12.84, Bank of Ireland slipped by 5c to E8.02, Anglo Irish edged down 1c to E8.51 
and Irish Life while Permanent was up 8c to E11.18. The Irish Central Bank has published its sectoral breakdown of

Ryanair Holdings, the European low-cost airline, has issued a statement calling on air traffic control (ATC) to 
compensate passengers for flight delays, and called for competition in the EU air traffic control industry, following a 
strike by air traffic controllers in Italy.
'Government monopoly ATC providers fail to control either their costs or their staff and allow restrictive work 
practices to handicap recruitment and training. This inevitably leads to long delays throughout the summer', the 
airline said in a statement.
Ryanair's director of flight & ground operations, David O'Brien, said: 'It is an outrage that monopoly ATC providers 
should be permitted to sabotage the travel plans of millions of passengers every summer, while increasing their 
charges at the same time.
'EU Governments have failed abysmally to protect passengers from the service failures of these overpriced 
monopolies.'

The rally in European stocks yesterday stuttered after US growth data hit early sentiment in US futures, but the 
markets still finished higher on strong mining and energy moves.
The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 edged up 0.3 per cent to 1,330.28, short of early gains, but building on 
Wednesday's climb, which had reversed a three-day slide.
Oil and energy shares were among the strongest gainers in Europe with  Total rising 1.5 per cent to EUR56.45, and 
Portugal's Galp Energia  up 2.4 per cent to EUR16.47, as crude oil futures hovered near $130 a barrel. Utility 
companies also put in a strong showing on hopes that they could pass on higher energy costs to consumers. 
Germany's Eon rose 2.8 per cent to EUR136.39 after UBS raised its price target from EUR130 to EUR190.
Domestic peer RWE rose 2.7 per cent to EUR83.76 on talk that Warren Buffett, Blackstone and Permira were 
mulling joining forces to bid for the German utility.
Norway's Renewable Energy plunged 8.1 per cent to NKr142.75 after Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation on the 
stock from "neutral" to "sell" leading the whole renewable sector lower, brokers said.
Swedish telecoms operator TeliaSonera  jumped 3.4 per cent to SKr54 on talk that France Telecom was shopping 
around banks for loans to fund a bid. TeliaSonera had lost ground Wednesday after France Telecom said it had not 
opened bid talks with the Swedish company.
The strength in oil prices was bad news for airlines. Irish budget carrier Ryanair  slid 3.5 per cent to EUR2.73 and 
Air France-KLM fell 3.8 per cent to EUR16.20, while Deutsche Lufthansa  fell 0.8 per cent to EUR16.10.
Mining and minerals stocks were also stronger after Rio Tinto predicted seven years of near-double-digit annual 
production growth, arguing its case for rejecting a $178bn takeover bid as too low.
In Germany, potash maker K&S climbed 3.4 per cent to EUR307 on positive broker comment. Yara International  
rose 1.3 per cent to NKr393.

Euroshares off lows midday as Dow seen weaker; Infineon warning weighs

Europe's leading bourses moved higher in opening deals, tracking overnight gains in New York and Asia after a 
smaller-than-expected drop in U.S. durable goods orders Wednesday but Infineon was left out in the cold after it 
warned third quarter EBIT will be knocked by flat sales in its communications business.
At 12.23 p.m., the DJ STOXX was up 13.56 points, or 0.44 percent, at 3183.53 and the DJ STOXX 600 was up 0.87 
points, or 0.27 percent, at 321.02.
Spread bettors, IG Index, said the Dow looks set to slip around 5 points lower after gains yesterday as investors 
stick to the sidelines ahead of today's data.
In the United States, first-quarter GDP is expected to be upwardly revised to 1.0 percent from 0.6 percent, with 
most of the revision taking place in the trade sector, economists said.
The Core PCE Price Index, the U.S. Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, is expected to have 
remained at 2.2 percent in the first quarter, the same annual rate as in the previous quarter.
This morning, a rebound in Euro zone M3 in April and a record fall in UK house prices in May, added to investor 
uncertainty ahead of the BoE and ECB rate setting meetings next Thursday.
Also limiting gains was German chipmaker, Infineon which fell 8.88 percent after the group said it expects revenues 
in its communications unit in the third quarter to be about flat from the previous quarter and expects EBIT to suffer 
accordingly.
The news also dragged Nokia down 0.71 percent although the Finnish handset giant said delays to its single chip 
phone ramp up will be immaterial. Alcatel-Lucent was down 1.88 percent.
Shares in Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA were 3.24 percent lower in mid-session trading after chairman 
Fernando Conte warned of a difficult 2008 due to a deteriorating economy, increasing competition and rising oil 
prices.
Speaking at today's AGM, Conte called for strategic alliances and sector M&As as one of the few solutions for 
struggling airlines to weather the current crisis.
Euroshares off lows midday as Dow seen weaker; Infineon warning weighs
Air Berlin Plc. -- which issued a profit warning in April -- said today it will hike prices for its flights and eliminate 
some unprofitable routes to offset surging fuel prices. Shares fell 1.75 percent.
The company will launch measures in the coming three to four weeks, he said.
And shares in easyJet Plc. and Ryanair Plc. slipped in morning trade, with Numis Securities cutting its earnings 
estimates and price targets for the two in a note warning of an imminent industry crisis in the wake of high oil prices.
And Volkswagen fell 2.03 percent as Deutsche Bank cut its recommendation on the shares to 'sell' from 'hold'.
And Saint-Gobain was at the top of the fallers board, down 2.69 percent, after Merrill Lynch downgraded the shares 
to 'neutral' from 'buy', as it believes the weakening operating environment will likely lead to increasing pressure on 
pricing.
But it wasn't all doom and gloom, with RWE and Iberdrola up 2.21 percent and 0.54 percent respectively as the pair 
were both upgraded to 'buy' from 'neutral' at UBS. RWE also got a boost from vague talk of a bid from private equity 
group Permira and Warren Buffet -- who is understood to be looking for acquisitions in Europe.
SSE was flat midday, having pulled back some of its early morning losses after the U.K. utility reported a well 
received set of full year results.
Oils remained higher ahead of U.S inventory data later even though the price of crude slipped below $130 per 
barrel.
New York-traded West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery was down $1.30 cents at $129.70 a barrel.
Total was up 0.94 percent but off earlier highs. Repsol added 0.38 percent and Royal Dutch Shell added 1.23 
percent.
BG Group, which is expected to sweeten its original bid for Origin Energy Ltd with a cash offer of at least $13A.2 
billion for Australia's second largest retail energy supplier added 1.47 percent.
And shares in the world's largest hedge fund manager, Man Group, went 3.82 percent higher after the group 
reported a higher than expected rise in full year profits, prompting Credit Suisse to lift its target price to 670 pence 
from 640 pence.
The broker repeated its 'outperform' stance and said it is raising its net inflows forecasts for 2009 and 2010.
It said the price target hike was driven by this increase and by the better than expected cost in today's numbers.

The Dublin market slipped firmly in to negative territory with banks and builders leading the fall amid renewed worry 
over the economy.
The ISEQ lost 22.68 points to 6,097.88.
The Government has issued a statement to quell any suggestion that it may row back on elements on the National 
Development Plan (NDP) due to lower economic growth. However, the latest down-beat assessment of the near-
term prospects for the economy from Davy has helped to reinforce investors concerns.
 Turning to the NDP, a cornerstone of the Government's plan to help lift the economy, Davy said it is absolutely 
imperative that it meets its capital spending commitments in the plan in order to help bolster the construction sector 
and to boost Ireland's long-run productivity. "Note that the NDP is not all about capital spending. Just over E100bn 
of the 2007-2013 programme is accounted for by spending on infrastructure, while the remaining E84bn is made of 
up of current expenditure on education, health, social initiatives etc," according to analyst, Rossa White. Banks lost 
heavily in morning trading with AIB shares down 8c to E12.85, Bank of Ireland dropped by 16c to E7.91, Anglo Irish 
fell by 25c to E8.57 and Irish Life and Permanent was down 8c to E10.98. Builders fared little better with CRH 
declining by 14c to E23.71, Grafton managed to gain 6c to E4.90 on bargain hunting after Wednesday's fall and 
McInerney edged down 2c to E0.88. Weighing on CRH's shares, Cimpor, the Portuguese cement producer, 
yesterday reported a 14pc fall in first quarter pre-tax profits due to falling cement consumption in the slumping 
Spanish and Portuguese construction markets as well as higher fuel costs. Meanwhile, UK merchanting volumes in 
the February to April quarter were up 0.6pc when compared to the same quarter in 2007. But "this should not 
disguise the underlying weakness in the UK market," according to Davy's Flor O'Donoghue. Volumes in April were 
down 3.5pc year-on-year according to the Builders Merchants' Federation. This would tally with recent comments 
by leading merchants. In its interim management statement on May 8th, Grafton commented that 'market conditions 
ISEQ falls to banks builders and airline
weakened in April compared to strong growth in April 2007 and like-for-like UK sales fell'. Airlines were a big drag 
on the index with Aer Lingus down 2c to E1.69 while Ryanair plunged 10c to E2.73. Elsewhere, shares in cardboard 
and packaging giant, Smurfit Kappa fell by 12c to E6.45 despite what Goodbody Stockbrokers noted was sharp 
share price increases for the US containerboard manufacturers, which were up strongly on the back of speculation 
that containerboard prices are poised to increase. Irish cider maker C and C Group which is trying to revive sales 
under its Magners brand has experienced no "major recovery" in demand for the beverage in U.K. pubs and bars 
this year, according to a briefing note from Merrion Capital. Half of 208 pubs selling Magners said sales were 
unchanged since March, while 43pc reported an increase, Dublin-based Merrion said in a research report, citing a 
pub survey. Shares in the drinks group slumped by 14c to E5.04.

The Dublin market dipped back in to negative territory as airlines plummeted following new peaks in the price of oil 
and as London and Wall Street shares fell.
The ISEQ closes 6.06 points lower at 6,108.20.
Irish investors took their cue from London and New York as markets their digested several US indicators showing 
the sharpest fall in US house prices for 20 years and as consumer confidence slumped to a 16-year low.
 Investors are concerned about the effect of soaring energy and food prices on consumers, who account for more 
than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. European shares also fell as losses in banks and GlaxoSmithKline offset 
gains in Vodafone and the impact of acquisition talk in the brewing sector. Oil prices were once again a main area 
of focus for investors following last week's surge in crude to USD135 a barrel. Yesterday, oil prices hit just over 
USD133 a barrel following unrest in oil producing Nigeria and as the dollar fell against the euro. Shares in Ireland's 
two listed airlines fell with Aer Lingus down 4c to E1.67 in morning trade before picking up slightly to close 1c down 
at E1.70 while Ryanair shares declined by 8c to E2.54. Banking shares mostly rose on bargain hunting after they 
bore the brunt yesterday of fears that the stubbornly rising cost of oil will feed in to general inflation. AIB shares 
gained 11c to E13.09, Bank of Ireland was up 10c to E8.41, Anglo Irish dipped 1c to E8.41 and Irish Life and 
Permanent edged down 1c to E10.69. Goodbody noted that the small business banking sector is about to get even 
tougher. About a month ago, Fitch downgraded Ireland from its MPI 2 (Macro Prudential Indicator) to its highest risk 
MPI 3 category due to the strength of the euro against our trading partners. The move was in recognition of the 
stresses that the currency could have on the SME sector and, hence, the knock-on credit quality implications for the 
banks. As if on cue, the Irish Small Medium Enterprises Association has just published the results of a survey with 
its members over the past two weeks, commenting that the "currency crisis threatens SME exporters". About 47pc 
of companies export to the UK and 65pc outlined that the weakness of sterling is have a negative impact on their 
ISEQ slips under as airlines weigh
business. Northern Foods in the UK has released a strong set of full-year 2007/2008 results, which were broadly 
inline with the prevailing market consensus. Of sectors relevant to Greencore and Kerry, the British company noted 
continuing growth in Ready Meals of 10pc compared to the previous year and Sandwiches and Salads, up 5pc, 
despite unseasonably poor summer weather. Greencore will issue it first half 2008 results tomorrow; where 
Goodbody Stockbrokers are forecasting adjusted earnings per share of 12.1c. Shares in Greencore dropped 8c to 
E3.54 and Kerry Group stocks were down 12c to E19.43. Construction related stocks, which are prone to both 
rising fuel costs and declining consumer demand, fell sharply. CRH shares were down 3c to E23.97, Grafton 
declined by 16c to E4.90, Abbey fell by 5c to E5.40 and Kingspan shed 15c to E6.85.

Body
Passenger numbers through Ireland West Airport Knock rose by a quarter in the first four months of this year to 
over 177,000 travellers, it said today.
The Easter break was the busiest on record with 30,000 passengers travelling through Ireland West Airport Knock. 
Last January the Airport management predicted that 2008 would be a record-breaking year having set ambitious 
targets to grow annual passenger numbers to 700,000.
New routes to Bristol with Ryanair, London Gatwick with XL.com and Glasgow International with bmibaby have 
been added in recent months and have been a significant factor in this growth.
 In 2008 UK passenger numbers are expected to surpass over half a million and UK tourism spend is projected to 
generate over E79m for the regional economy of the West and North West. Commenting on the positive start to 
2008, Robert Grealis, CEO, Ireland West Airport Knock said: "Ireland West Knock continues to grow by offering 
consumers a choice of airline brands and a choice of sun, ski and short break destinations on scheduled and 
charter flights. We want to ensure we continue to provide a convenient and congestion free environment and work 
will shortly commence on a major expansion to the terminal building to enhance and expand the facilities and 
services we offer to ensure we remain the number one international airport of choice serving the West and North 
West of Ireland." Knock will welcome another new airline brand to its airport following the announcement that airline 
CityJet is to provide the daily return scheduled air services on the Public Service Obligation (PSO) regional air route 
to Dublin. The contract has been awarded to CityJet following an EU Public Tendering process and the new 
contract is for a three-year period commencing on 22 July 2008.

Highlight: The Dublin market moved out of the red in quiet trading with both the US and UK stock markets on 
holiday.
Body
The Dublin market moved out of the red in quiet trading with both the US and UK stock markets on holiday.
The index closed 48.62 points higher at 6,114.26.
Investors are awaiting new data on inflation in both the eurozone and UK due out later this week.
 Consumer price data for Germany is expected to show price pressures remain elevated and that the European 
Central Bank will continue to sound hawkish in its monetary policy rhetoric. The CPI figure for the wider eurozone 
on Friday is expected to hit 3.6 percent, up from 3.3pc in April but matching March's level, a historical record. Oil 
prices, meanwhile, showed no signs of falling back after last week's surge. Oil traded higher at over USD132 a 
barrel today as the US summer driving season kicked off, underscoring concerns that output was inadequate amid 
rising demand. Tightness in the oil market has made prices sensitive to a confluence of factors, including a weak 
US dollar, speculative funds, an unwillingness by oil-producers to raise production and geopolitical tensions, 
analysts said. Bank of Ireland was a top gaining stock in morning trade with shares up 14c to E8.24. Bank of Ireland 
shareholders' equity fell in the year to March 2008 by 4pc from 686c to 662c. This decline comes against the 
backdrop of ten years of growth. "However, we believe that the impact from the AFS and cashflow hedge reserve 
movements will largely come back when markets normalise. Similarly, an element of the pension fund obligation 
decline may also reverse. The impact of foreign exchange adjustments will depend on whether the euro stays 
strong relative to sterling and the US dollar," according to Davy's Niamh Hore. The rest of the shares in the sector 
put in a less than sparkling performance with AIB up 4c to E12.98, Anglo Irish edged up 7c to E8.42 and Irish Life 
and Permanent gained just 2c to E10.70. Aer Lingus shares made impressive strides with the stock up 5c to E1.75 
before settling back to a 1c gain at E1.71. In its 2007 results announcement, BMI became the first airline to 
recognise slots on its balance sheet - it includes a value of £770m in respect of the London Heathrow slots. Aer 
Lingus Heathrow slots are now worth around E300m, according to Davy's aviation expert, Stephen Furlong. Shares 
ISEQ moves higher in quiet day's trade
in Ryanair edged up 1c to E2.63 after major losses last week as crude oil prices broke new records above the 
USD135 a barrel mark and amid talk that the no-frills airline would be selling more than the 20 aircraft it had 
planned. Shares in drug developer, Elan, surged by 36c to E15.98 amid press reports over the weekend that its 
Elan Drug Technology (EDT) division would be either sold off or spun out in an IPO, with various reports valuing the

The Dublin market moved out of the red in morning trade today in quiet trading with both the US and UK stock 
markets on holiday.
By midday, the ISEQ was 37.37 points higher at 6,103.01.
European shares were a little stronger this morning as a rise in oil and energy stocks was offset by a decline in 
banks, with UBS under renewed pressure.
 Oil prices, meanwhile, showed no signs of falling back after last week's surge. Oil traded higher at over USD132 a 
barrel today as the US summer driving season kicked off, underscoring concerns that output was inadequate amid 
rising demand. Tightness in the oil market has made prices sensitive to a confluence of factors, including a weak 
US dollar, speculative funds, an unwillingness by oil-producers to raise production and geopolitical tensions, 
analysts said. Bank of Ireland was a top gaining stock in morning trade with shares up 14c to E8.24. Bank of Ireland 
shareholders' equity fell in the year to March 2008 by 4pc from 686c to 662c. This decline comes against the 
backdrop of ten years of growth. "However, we believe that the impact from the AFS and cashflow hedge reserve 
movements will largely come back when markets normalise. Similarly, an element of the pension fund obligation 
decline may also reverse. The impact of foreign exchange adjustments will depend on whether the euro stays 
strong relative to sterling and the US dollar," according to Davy's Niamh Hore. The rest of the shares in the sector 
put in a less than sparkling performance with AIB down 5c to E12.89, Anglo Irish flat at E8.35 and Irish Life and 
Permanent declined by 7c to E10.61. Aer Lingus shares made impressive strides with the stock up 5c to E1.75. In 
its 2007 results announcement, BMI became the first airline to recognise slots on its balance sheet - it includes a 
value of £770m in respect of the London Heathrow slots. Aer Lingus Heathrow slots are now worth around E300m, 
according to Davy's aviation expert, Stephen Furlong. Shares in Ryanair edged up 1c to E2.63 after major losses 
last week as crude oil prices broke new records above the USD135 a barrel mark and amid talk that the no-frills

E15.98 amid press reports over the weekend that its Elan Drug Technology (EDT) division would be either sold off 
or spun out in an IPO, with various reports valuing the new entity at up to USD1.5bn. Shares in CRH rose by 26c to 
E23.99. The latest US existing home sales data for April shows a mom decline of 1pc to a seasonally adjusted

not impossible this year, but that the Irish no-frills airline would survive while others crashed and burned.
Body
Ryanair chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said that crude oil at USD200 a barrel on the world market is not 
impossible this year, but that the Irish no-frills airline would survive while others crashed and burned.
Goldman Schas, the US global investment bank, has predicted that oil prices would continue to rise, warning 
consumers and businesses alike to expect a barrel of oil to sell for as much as USD200 in the next six months to 
two years.
Last week, oil prices soared to a new USD135 a barrel record - causing havoc across the globe and raising fears 
that high oil costs would push up inflation.
 USD135 a barrel is double what it was at the same time last year and as a result, the travel industry may see even 
more airlines continue to fold this year. Last week, Air France-KLM announced that rising fuel prices were 
significantly cutting into its operating profit, which was likely to drop by about a third this year. All-business-class 
airline Silverjet failed to secure some important funding and as a result, suspended trading on its shares. Like other 
airlines, fuel costs are continuing to cause problems for Silverjet, despite the business class clientele. Already 
Ryanair, like all other airlines, is struggling with the high fuel prices. 'Clearly our profits would be massively 
impacted if oil hit USD200 a barrel,' said Mr O'Leary. 'They already have been massively impacted. Our oil bill will 
double this year but we still expect to be profitable.' According to O'Leary, only four airlines would be able to survive 
an economy where oil sold for USD200 a barrel. Those airlines would be British Airways, Lufthansa, Air France and 
Ryanair, he said. 'Such a scenario would be great for Ryanair as we would be one of the airlines that would still be 
in business,' said O'Leary. 'Clearly a lot of airlines would go bust if oil hit USD200 a barrel. It would also mean the 
world would hit a recession. People would get more price sensitive so they would choose to fly with us.' Analyst Joe 
Gill looked at seven airlines around Europe and found that only EasyJet and Aer Lingus come anywhere close to 
the cost disciplines exercised by Ryanair and both are well ahead of the likes of Aer Berlin, Norwegian, SkyEurope 
O'Leary considers USD200 a barrel oil
and Vueling. Ryanair last year said that it could take a previously unthinkable USD100 a barrel price on the chin 
and still turn a profit thanks to its relentless cost squeeze and Mr O'Leary is maintaining the same defiant stand now 
that oil edges closer to USD200 a barrel. On revenues, Mr Gill found that Ryanair has unit sales that are 22pc lower 
than the average of the other six carriers but its unit costs are a massive 40pc lower than all the others. It is this 
fixation with keeping a lid on costs throughout its operations that singles Ryanair out as the most profitable in 
Europe and 'threatens the profitability of any carrier with higher unit costs,' he said.

Europe's largest low-cost carrier, Ryanair Holdings, could decommission more than the 20 planes that it announced 
at an investor briefing last month.
As soaring fuel costs make routes uneconomic, the company had said last month that it planned to take 20 planes 
out of commission - nearly three times the number it mothballed last year.
However, it is now thought that number could be much higher when the company reports annual results a week 
from tomorrow.
 Ryanair, like all other airlines is reeling from the cost of fuel. Last week, crude oil reached a new record of USD135 
a barrel with one analyst predicting that USD200 a barrel this year is not impossible.

The cost of travel insurance can vary depending on the policy and provider. However, more important than the 
price, you should make sure you're adequately covered.
With the June bank holiday weekend just around the corner and children counting down the days until the school 
holidays, there is a definite sense of summer in the air. But if you are travelling abroad this year, shop around in 
advance to make sure you get the right insurance package to cover any unexpected mishaps.
A number of variables can affect the premium you pay for travel insurance. Before you decide on a policy, it is 
important to consider what type of activities you will be doing on holiday, where you are going and how long you will 
be away.
While all these factors can affect your premium, it is important to not focus solely on price when choosing your 
cover. You should also check potential payouts in the case of illness, delay or lost bags.
Weekend breaks If you are not a regular traveller, it can often be more cost-effective to arrange travel insurance on 
a trip-by-trip basis. It is also worth remembering that some insurers offer a cheaper premium if you already have a 
private health insurance policy with VHI, Quinn or Vivas.
The recent advent of a number of online insurers has pushed down premiums for travellers, but there is still a huge 
range in prices.
The dearest cover for a simple European weekend trip works out six times more expensive than the cheapest - a 
difference of about  60 for a couple.
Getcover.com offers the cheapest cover for an adult taking a weekend trip in Europe, at  6 for anyone with a private 
health insurance policy, while AA's non-member rate of  37 represents the dearest premium.
Don't let an accident ruin your break
The discount for private health insurance with www.getcover.com applies as long as the customer's health 
insurance policy covers at least  55,000 for overseas medical expenses and repatriation.
With Ryanair, the cost of insurance for an adult travelling to Europe for a weekend ranges from  7.50 to  14.50.The 
lower rate applies if the cover is chosen during the flight booking process. If you decide to purchase cover on the 
airline's travel insurance website after booking your flight, a rate of  9 applies.
The highest rate -  14.50 - applies to travel insurance for a European weekend where a Ryanair flight is not 
involved. Travelling further afield generally means a higher premium.
The cheapest premium for a weekend trip to the United States is also with Getcover.com, which charges  12 to 
cover anyone with private health insurance. AA's cover is once again the dearest, tipping the scales at  87 for non-
members.
Annual cover Single trip policies, especially for a trip to the United States, can be more expensive than an annual 
travel insurance policy. So, if you travel abroad a lot, it is worth investigating multi-trip policies, which will usually 
cover you for a year's travel.
Research by VHI found that the number of people opting for annual travel insurance has increased in recent years. 
Just one in ten people opted for annual cover in 2003, but this figure had more than doubled by last year, with 22 
per cent of travellers choosing an annual policy.
The cheapest annual premium is available from Blue Insurance, on its website www.annualmultitrip.com, at a cost 
of  29.99. The highest rate comes from AA, with non-members facing an annual charge of  145.
Discounts for private health insurance also apply to annual policies with some insurers. For example 
www.justcover.ie charges  42 for an annual policy for holders of private health insurance and  70.51 for those 
without it.
While annual policies can represent good value for frequent travellers, restrictions can apply to the duration of trips 
and the total number of days that you can be away in any year.
Most insurers limit the duration of any single trip to 31 days. However, a number of insurers, including 
www.getcover.com and            www.justcover.ie, allow travellers to increase the duration of single trips to up to 90 
days. Extending the duration of single trips will carry a higher premium.
Both AA and VHI cover single trips of up to 60 days under their standard multi-trip policies. With AA, the total 
number of days abroad must not exceed 180 days a year.
Discounts Before you decide which policy is right for you, check whether your home or motor insurance provider 
offers discounts on travel insurance.
For example, AA offers a 20 per cent discount to customers who already have home and motor insurance with the 
firm, while online insurer www.getcover.com applies a 10 per cent discount for existing customers.
AIB offers a discount of 10 per cent if you sign up for its travel insurance online, while Ulster Bank gives a 5 per 
cent discount to customers who pay for their travel insurance by direct debit from an Ulster Bank account.
Excess Another matter to bear in mind when choosing cover is the excess, that is, the first part of a claim you must 
pay yourself. For example, some claims under an Aer Lingus travel insurance policy have no excess, while an 
excess of up to  245 applies on personal liability claims.
A spokeswoman for Ryanair said the excesses on its policies varied according to the conditions of the policy, while 
online insurer www.justcover.ie said the excess on its policies ranged from  70 to  100.
Don't let an accident ruin your break
AA applies an excess of  75, while both VHI and AIB have a  65 excess. Getcover.com has an excess of  125 on 
medical claims and a lower excess of  85 on claims for cancellation, delays or baggage loss.
Level of cover A quick examination of your policy will reveal that three main elements offer the largest payouts. 
Personal accident cover will pay out if you are injured, while medical expenses cover will finance the cost of any 
treatment you receive abroad. Personal liability cover is insurance against costs you may incur if you injure 
someone else or their property during your trip abroad.
For personal accident claims, with its basic annual cover, www.annualmultitrip.com will pay out up to  15,000. The 
highest cover provided for personal accident claims is  40,000, with both VHI and            www.getcover.com.
Maximum payouts for medical expenses can run to millions of euro. Aer Lingus provides the highest level of cover 
at  13million,whileRyanair's cover is lowest at  3.3 million.
If you injure someone else while abroad, insurers may pay out a seven figure sum. For example, 
www.annualmultitrip.com pays up to  1million for personal liability, while            www.getcover.com pays up to  3.25 
million.
While personal accident, personal liability and medical expenses may have the highest payouts, most claims relate 
to more mundane things like lost bags or delayed flights. If your baggage is lost, Ryanair provides the lowest level 
of cover - up to  1,235; AA provides the highest, covering baggage loss or delay up to  2,750.
A spokesman for AA said it would not pay out more than  500 for any single item that had not been specifically 
listed as a high-value item under the policy.
A lost or delayed bag will be covered up to  1,235 with Ryanair. With www.justcover.ie, a maximum payment of  
2,175 will be made if your bag is lost and  145 if your bag is delayed.
Delayed bags will generally mean a lower payout, with most insurers only providing a few hundred euro if your bags 
arrive later than you do. With AIB, a claim for a wayward bag is capped at  100.
Most travel insurance policies will specify a maximum level of cover for personal money lost or stolen during your 
holiday. Ryanair leads the way, with cover of up to  825, while AA will stump up a maximum of  260.
If your holiday is cancelled, most insurers will cover you up to a few thousand euro. AA provides the best cover, 
with a maximum payout of  11,000. On the other hand, Ryanair caps its payment for cancelled holidays at  825. If 
your holiday starts late, you can claim a payment for travel delay under most policies. However, specific conditions 
apply.
For example, with Ryanair, the lowest payer on travel delay, the insured person will receive  35 for the first 12 hours 
of a travel delay and  17 for each subsequent 12-hour period, with the payout capped at  100.The best deal comes 
from AA, with a maximum payout of  700.
Take the risk factor into account A good general rule when buying a travel insurance policy is that a higher risk for 
the insurer usually translates into a higher premium for you.
* If you take part in adventure activities, does your policy cover you? If not, you could face a hefty medical bill 
should you be involved in an accident.
If you have an adventurous streak, don't assume you are covered for accidents while you're white-water rafting on 
the Zambezi River or glacier trekking in New Zealand. Most policies have strict rules on what constitutes hazardous 
activity, but it is important to check the small print as some insurers are stricter than others.
For example, many insurers will not cover bungee jumps, but VHI and www.getcover.com will. However, VHI 
imposes limitations on the level of personal accident and personal liability cover to which the individual is then 
entitled.
Don't let an accident ruin your break
* Some insurers charge an additional premium for winter sports cover, as part of an annual travel insurance policy. 
This can vary considerably from one insurer to the next. For example, Ryanair automatically covers winter sports for 
up to 24 days, as part of its standard rate policy, while basic 17day winter sports cover with www.justcover.ie will 
add an extra  9 to your premium.
* Before you travel abroad, check that all your planned destinations are covered. Most insurers said they would not 
cover anyone travelling against the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs.
However, VHI said individuals would be covered for travel home if unexpected civil unrest broke out in a country 
during their visit.
* Older travellers may face higher premiums. For example, Ryanair does not provide annual cover for anyone over 
65, while www.justcover.ie charges a higher price to travellers aged 66 to 75. The cost of AA's worldwide policy 
more than doubles for travellers over 65, rising from  49 to  139. Some older travellers may find it hard to secure 
cover.
Aer Lingus will provide annual cover for people up to 79 years old, and there are no age restrictions on its single-trip 
policies.
Travellers up to 86 years of age on single-trip insurance and up to 74 on multi-trip policies, will be covered by 
www.annualmultitrip.com.

Weigh your options (and your baggage) before you decide how cheap your holiday flight will really be, writes Emma 
Kennedy.
You've booked your hotel by the beach, arranged your holiday finances and bought travel insurance to cover any 
holiday disasters. All that's left is to pack your bags and jet off to the sun.
However, organising your flight can be a costly business, with a wide array of fees and charges that can add a hefty 
chunk to your holiday bill.
''Baggage charges have increased substantially in the last year," said James Doorley, chairman of the Consumers' 
Association of Ireland. ''Last summer, a family travelling with four checked-in suitcases - not unusual for a week or 
two-week break - would have paid  48 in baggage fees with Ryanair and Aer Lingus.
''After a number of price hikes in the last six months, the same four checked-in suitcases will now cost  80 with 
Ryanair and  96 with Aer Lingus - and if you arrive with extra bags or bags over the weight limit, you will end up 
paying a lot more," he said.
''The airlines claim that this is to encourage people to travel light, which may be possible on short trips, but it is 
ridiculous to suggest that individuals and families going away for a holiday can bring all they need in hand luggage."
Low fares may not be as low as they first appear. ''Consumers need to factor in all the extra fees and charges 
before booking a flight," said Doorley.
''Consumers can still get good value with these airlines, but it's important to remember that, while other airlines may 
have higher-up front prices, they may actually work out cheaper in the end, because they don't charge you all these 
various fees and charges."
Check out your options before you check in
Taxes and charges With taxes varying from route to route, customers can be left confused. ''Taxes and charges are 
determined by the landing charges of individual airports and the landing tax charged by governments," explained an 
Aer Arann spokeswoman.
For example, an adult flying from Galway to Faro, in Portugal, on Sunday June 22, will incur a tax charge of  40. 
Flying back a week later, a tax charge of  23.70 will apply.
An adult flying from Dublin to Malaga in Spain, with Ryanair, the same week, will face taxes and charges of  22.94 
on the outward leg of the journey and  29.65 on the way back - a total of  52.59.
Aer Lingus would charge taxes of  53.49 for a return trip from Dublin to Malaga, on the same dates.
Seating The days of first come, first served are disappearing, with some airlines now charging passengers to be the 
first to board or to get the best seat.
Aer Arann does not charge customers for priority boarding or seat reservation. Ryanair passengers who check-in 
online used to receive priority boarding free of charge, but the airline has announced that it will charge  5 a head for 
this service from June 3. Ryanair customers using airport check-in who want priority boarding already pay a fee of  
5.
Aer Lingus passengers can avail of free seat assignment at the airport, but face a fee if they want to pick their seats 
when booking online. The highest fees are charged for exit rows, with charges of up to  15.
Fuel Aer Lingus recently announced an increase in the fuel surcharge for long-haul passengers, due to the 
continued rise in the price of oil.
The surcharge varies depending on your destination, but a return trip to New York is now  30 dearer - the fuel 
surcharge has increased from  50 to  65 on each leg of the journey. The airline first introduced fuel surcharges two 
years ago.
A number of transatlantic operators levy a similar surcharge - for example, Delta Airlines imposes a fuel surcharge 
of  100 on its Dublin to New York route.
Luggage With Aer Arann, there is no charge to check in your luggage once your bag is within the 15 kilogramme 
allowance. Ryanair charges  10, each way, for checked baggage booked online. If checked baggage fees are paid 
either at the airport or through a Ryanair cal l centre, the charge is doubled.
Aer Lingus charges  12, each way, per bag, if you book online. The charge will be 50 per cent higher, if you decide 
at the airport that you want to check in your bag.
If travelling light is not your thing, be prepared to pay extra to have all your 'essentials' with you on holiday. Aer 
Arann charges  7 per kilo for excess luggage, while Ryanair charges more than double that, at  15 per excess kilo.
Cityjet charges  12 for each excess kilo of luggage checked in on short-haul flights, but passengers who know they 
will be over the limit can avail of a reduced excess baggage fee of  8.40 per kilo, if they check in online. Aer Lingus 
charges  9 per kilo for excess baggage.
Extras If you are an adventure sports enthusiast or are travelling with children, you may find yourself paying even 
more charges.
Transporting your child's buggy will cost you  10 each way with Aer Arann, while Aer Lingus and Cityjet will carry 
buggies for free.
With Ryanair, one fully collapsible pushchair may be carried free of charge for infants. However, additional infant 
equipment, such as car booster seats and travel cots, are charged at  10 per item per one way flight.
Check out your options before you check in
A ski trip or surfing holiday may work out dearer than you expected once you factor in the cost of transporting your 
gear. Aer Arann charges  20 fee per flight for sports equipment, while bikes incur a higher charge of  30, each way.
Ryanair will transport sports equipment for  30 per item per flight, if booked online. The charge rises by 25 per cent 
if booked at the airport or through a Ryanair call centre.
Cityjet charges  20 to carry skis and  40 to transport bikes from Dublin to Paris or London City. Aer Lingus charges  
30 to carry sports or music equipment booked online, or  35 if the charge is paid at the airport.
Get the right loan for your holiday Most of us would love to spend endless weeks in far-flung locations, soaking up 
the sun and experiencing new cultures, but financing this lifestyle can prove challenging. Even shorter, less exotic 
holidays can prove costly, once you factor in all the associated expenses.
If you take out a loan to finance your holiday, take care that you get the best deal on offer. The Financial Regulator 
offers the following advice on holiday loans:
1. Shop around. Don't automatically assume you will get the best deal from your local bank or credit union.
2. Check the annual percentage rates that you are being offered, as some lenders charge considerably higher rates 
than others.
3. Your monthly loan repayments may look affordable but, before you commit, look at the total cost of credit. This is 
the difference between what you borrow and the total that you will repay.
4. Pay off your loan in a year. If you are taking out a holiday loan, aim to have it paid off before your next holiday.
5. Check if the loan rate is fixed or variable, and whether there would be any charge or penalty if you want to pay 
the loan back early and in full.
6. Overdraft or credit cards can be handy for smaller amounts, but these options can be more expensive, 
depending on the interest rate and how quickly you pay them off.

A new Ryanair route from Dublin to Tours in France, due to start on Wednesday, is under threat, because of the 
decision by the mayor of Tours to stop paying a subsidy to the airline.
The socialist mayor of Tours, Jean Germain,with the backing of the Green Party, decided at a meeting of the 
Conseil Municipal last month not to pay the  830,000 regional subsidy.
Guillaume Peltier, spokesman for the Mouvement pour la France (MPF) party, said the ending of the subsidy could 
put a ''disastrous brake'' on the development of Tours' Val-de-Loire airport, which he described as the ''economic 
engine'' of the local area.
Ryanair already operates a service between Tours and Stansted in Essex. Between 2004 and 2007, passenger 
numbers on the route grew by 9.7 per cent, to 75,000 per year.
In a blog, local engineer Dominique Lemoine said the French taxpayer paid part of every Ryanair ticket.
He said that Tours taxpayers contributed more than  1 million to the support of the airport:  350,000 in subventions 
from the central region, with similar contributions from the conseil general of Indre-et-Loire, and from the 
communaute d'agglomerations of Tours.
Lemoine said that Tours was only one hour's journey by train from an international airport, and did not need an 
airport which required public subventions to be economically viable.
''Air travel is the most polluting and energy-hungry form of transport, and let's not imagine that Tours will take off 
economically if it has an airport which is said to be international," he wrote.
A spokeswoman for Ryanair said: ''We never comment on airport agreements. The route from Dublin to Tours will 
start this month."
French refuse to pay for Ryanair
In a separate incident, the wing of a Ryanair aircraft flying from Stansted to Carcassonne in southern France struck 
the guttering of a building at the regional airport last week, while being towed onto its stand. Nobody was hurt.
''The winglet was inspected by our engineers, the minor damage was repaired and the aircraft returned to service 
the following morning," the spokeswoman said.

Europe's largest low-cost carrier, Ryanair Holdings, could decommission more than the 20 planes that it announced 
at an investor briefing last month, reported The Sunday Times.
As soaring fuel costs make routes uneconomic, the company had said last month that it planned to take 20 planes 
out of commission -- nearly three times the number it mothballed last year. However the paper said it is now thought 
that number could be much higher when the company reports annual results on Tuesday week.

CAA attacks lack of competition
Remedy could include sell-offs
Body
The future breakup of BAA moved a step closer yesterday, as the airports economic regulator said the group's 
common ownership of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted was harmful to competition.
Harry Bush, group director of economic regulation at the Civil Aviation Authority, said it was "timely to ask whether 
greater competition would better serve consumers".
The CAA, the economic regulator for the three main London airports, added its weight to the growing calls for 
increased competition in the airports sector, backing the recent highly critical interim report from the Competition 
Commission on the structure of BAA.
The CAA said it agreed with the commission that the common ownership of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted by 
BAA was "likely to prevent, restrict and/or distort competition".
It said evidence from UK regional airports, and from the non-regulated London airports, showed airports could 
compete for airlines and passengers and that such competition could deliver significant benefits to consumers.
The CAA said it had not identified any significant benefits that had arisen from BAA's common ownership of the 
airports.
It said it was "important to consider the appropriate 'remedy' to the adverse effects" of the common ownership. 
Remedies could include the divestment of airports.
The Competition Commission said last month BAA's ownership of seven airports in the south-east of England and 
Scotland adversely affected competition.
Airport regulator slates BAA ownership
The CAA's latest evidence will be considered by the commission ahead of the publication of its provisional findings 
in August, including possible remedies such as requiring the sale of one or more of BAA's airports.
The commission investigation is a further serious challenge to the owners of BAA, a consortium led by Ferrovial, the 
Spanish construction, infrastructure and services group, which acquired the airports operator less than two years 
ago. Ferrovial is already struggling to refinance more than £11bn of BAA debt following the highly leveraged 
takeover.
The CAA's own economic regulation of the three London airports has also come under heavy attack from leading 
airlines and Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier and the biggest airline operating at Stansted, again called yesterday 
for the replacement of Mr Bush.

European airlines and other fuel-guzzling industries were savaged this week as the oil price surged to a new high 
and investors switched into energy stocks and defensive heavyweights.
In a week that saw oil storm to a record $135 a barrel, several European airlines warned that rising costs and 
slowing demand would hit profits hard.
Air France-KLM forecast that its operating profit would fall 30 per cent this year, while Finnair said it was bracing 
for a fall in passenger numbers because of the global economic slowdown. Air France-KLM fell 17.7 per cent to 
EUR16.66 and Finnair lost 16.1 per cent to EUR5.48, with the gloom spreading to Germany's Lufthansa , down 9.7 
per cent to EUR15.50, and Spain's Iberia , which fell 9.3 per cent to EUR2.15.
"The airline industry cannot cope with oil at current levels," said Gerald Khoo, an analyst at Credit Suisse. "Airlines 
will have to reduce capacity in order to stay afloat." Mr Khoo said he believed Ryanair would emerge as one of "the 
survivors and winners of this industry downturn", because of its low cost base and strong balance sheet. The Irish 
budget carrier fell 9.9 per cent to EUR2.61.
The week was just as bad for carmakers, with Peugeot down 9.3 per cent to EUR40.79, Fiat 6.2 per cent lower at 
EUR14.38, and Renault falling 8.6 per cent to EUR62.49.
Volkswagen slipped 6.6 per cent to EUR180.80 as the German government agreed a revised law that would allow 
the state of Lower Saxony, which has a minority stake in the company, to make strategic decisions, including 
blocking takeovers.
Porsche , which is looking to increase its 31 per cent stake in VW, tumbled 10.6 per cent to EUR119.42, though the 
European Commission may yet scrap the German law.
In the wider market, fear that expensive oil would squeeze corporate balance sheets and stifle a broader economic 
recovery helped drive the FTSE Eurofirst 300 1.7 per cent lower to 1,322.22 yesterday, extending its losses over 
Airlines buffeted over fuel costs
the week to 3.1 per cent. Frankfurt's Xetra Dax fell 1.9 per cent to 6,944.05 and the CAC 40 in Paris slipped 2.8 per 
cent to 4,933.77.
Among the stocks to escape the waves of selling was Edison SpA , the Italian power company.
It rose 6.1 per cent to EUR1.69 after the country's government said it would reintroduce nuclear power to reduce 
energy costs for companies and households.
The rising oil price gave a boost to companies involved in solar and wind power. Norway's Renewable Energy 
Corp , which makes solar cells, rose 0.4 per cent to NKr175.5 and Denmark's Vestas Wind  advanced 6 per cent 
to DKr637.
Another big gainer was Deutsche Postbank , which rose 3.7 per cent to EUR62.31 on reports it was the target of a 
joint bid from Commerzbank , down 1.7 per cent to EUR22.19, and Allianz , down 8 per cent to EUR118.52.

Lack of direction from world markets kept the Irish index in negative territory for the fourth straight day this morning.
By midday, the ISEQ was down 16.73 points to 6,129.16.
A Wall Street rebound overnight failed to lift Irish investors' appetite for stock buying with profit taking still the order 
of the day.
 New York recovered following two days of steep declines, with U.S. investors finding relief after oil prices stepped 
back. However, news that BMI's profits slumped by half and as BA chief, Willie Walsh, warned that the days of 
cheap flights are all but numbered, unsettled Irish investors. Light, sweet crude oil for July delivery rose to above 
USD135 per barrel for the first time before finishing at USD 130.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, 
down USD2.36 from the previous trading day but with no sign of an easing in the upward pressure on prices. This 
time last year, crude oil was priced at just USD65 a barrel. Shares in Ryanair, which has pledged never to impose 
fuel surcharges but has been steadily raising ancillary charges, fell by 7c to E2.62 while Aer Lingus managed to 
edge 1c higher at E1.67. The property and construction slowdown at home came to the fore again. The latest 
mortgage lending data confirmed the pretty anaemic activity levels in the Irish property market in the first three 
months of the year. While the volume of mortgage lending fell by 25pc compared to last year, excluding top-up and 
re-mortgaging, transactions declined by a disappointing 37pc. "Given this reality, it is no surprise that the stock of 
homes for sale continues to increase. As we come closer to the end of the Spring selling season (which, indeed, 
may be a contradiction in terms this year!), it is timely to assess the recent trends in the stock of homes for sale," 
said Dermot O'Leary of Goodbody Stockbrokers. Banking stocks put in a lacklustre performance with AIB shares up 
2c to E13.04, Bank of Ireland gained 4c to E8.19, Anglo Irish was up 4c to E8.64 while Irish Life and Permanent 
declined by 11c to E10.75. IL and P told its AGM in Dublin that the group's finances are in a strong position, 
reassuring shareholders that it will weather the downturn in lending better than most. Construction related shares

were mostly a drag on the index with CRH down 15c to E24.00, Grafton gained by 4c to E5.07 while Kingspan fell 
by 11c to E7.09. Kingspan's European peer, Rockwoll, deliver in-line results but showcased the challenges facing 
the European insulation sector this year, particularly businesses like Rockwool and Kingspan that are coming off 
sparkling 2007 results, according to Davy Research. Rockwool's first quarter revenues fell 5pc, with insulation 
(93pc of group sales) down 6pc. Group EBIT fell 45pc, with insulation EBIT down 47pc. Insulation margins as a 
result fell from 18.4pc in the first quarter of 2007 to 10.4pc.

A combination of rising oil prices and weakening economies looks set to take a heavy toll on the industry, writes 
Kevin Done
Body
The structure of the world airline industry is going to change "profoundly", Jean-Cyril Spinetta, chairman and chief 
executive of Air France-KLM, warned yesterday, as carriers struggle to come to terms with a doubling of the oil 
price in the past 12 months and weakening economic growth.
"There will be major restructuring. Things are changing violently and quickly," he said.
The outlines of the winners and losers in the latest global aviation crisis are already becoming clear at frightening 
speed.
The long-term survivors will be the airlines with already strong balance sheets, that are going into the storm with low 
debt levels and big cash reserves. Many of these have taken the opportunity offered by their financial strength to 
hedge a large part of their fuel requirements for the next 12 to 24 months.
Financially weaker airlines have been unable to afford such protective insurance.
Some, such as Ireland's Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost carrier, despite an enviably strong balance sheet, 
chose to gamble the oil price would fall back. It is now paying the price.
The winners will also be the carriers that have continued to invest in new aircraft during recent years and which 
therefore have the most fuel-efficient fleets. They include Ryanair and EasyJet, the dominant European low-cost 
carriers, and AirAsia, the low-cost leader in Asia Pacific.
The winners among the full service network airlines will include those with the strongest hubs, which can draw in 
feeder traffic from wide regions to fill more seats on their long-haul services and which have the flexibility within 
their networks to move capacity around the world from the regions where the economy is weakening to the stronger 
performers.
Airlines must battle for survival as pressures rise
Airlines likely to emerge more profitable from the crisis and with increased market shares include the European big 
three, Air France-KLM, Lufthansa and British Airways, from Asia Pacific, Singapore Airlines, Hong Kong's Cathay 
Pacific and Australia's Qantas and from the Middle East Dubai-based Emirates, which is using its location to build a 
true world hub in the Gulf.
Inevitably it is fringe players and recent start-ups that have proved most vulnerable in the first months of the 
unfolding crisis.
Specialist all-business class carriers Maxjet Airways and Eos Airlines have already folded.
So has Oasis Hong Kong Airlines, which tried to bring radically lower fares to long-haul routes between Hong Kong 
and Europe and North America.
Eight US airlines have already filed for bankruptcy protection this year, including established players Frontier and 
Aloha Airlines, and a low-cost start up, Skybus. Of the eight, five have already ceased service, including Maxjet and 
Eos. US carriers had a combined pre-tax loss of nearly $2bn, excluding special items, in the first quarter.
The very biggest in the US are seeking salvation in each other's arms in the hope, possibly misplaced, that mergers 
and consolidation can help to cut costs.
Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines have already announced a plan to merge, while United Airlines, US Airways 
and Continental Airlines ponder which could be the right partner.
The US industry illustrates most starkly how quickly rising fuel bills can bring airlines to the abyss, when they are 
burdened by large numbers of ageing, fuel-guzzling aircraft.
Several leading US airlines are not long out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring after the deep recession of the 
early years of the decade. They are again pressing the panic button after managing neither to restore their balance 
sheets nor to renew their fleets.
American Airlines, the industry leader, has the distinction of being the only US legacy carrier that has not sought 
protection from its creditors in previous downturns. But it is still operating around 300 ageing MD-80s in its short-
haul domestic fleet and said on Wednesday it would be forced to retire 40 to 45 of them in coming months in 
response to record fuel prices. It is also retiring 35 to 40 older regional jets.
In Europe, the long-standing basket case of the industry, Alitalia, is also burdened by a large fleet of old MD-80 
short-haul jets, and it is largely unhedged against the soaring oil price. It is only just being kept alive by the drip feed 
of the latest tranche of state aid.
In Spain, a shake-out is looming among the smaller low cost carriers including Vueling and Clickair, while start ups 
in Eastern Europe, such as SkyEurope and Wizz Air, could also prove vulnerable to sharply rising fuel bills.
Elsewhere in Europe increasingly loud distress signals are being sent out by Austrian Airlines and SAS 
Scandinavian Airlines.
And for even the strongest there will be pain. British Airways last week reported record profits for the year to March 
and the first 10 per cent operating profit margin in its history.
And yet it also warned that $125 oil could wipe away the entire operating profit this year, without further cost-saving, 
fare increases and cuts in capital spending.
Wolfgang Mayrhuber, Lufthansa chief executive, was virtually alone in the global airline industry when he left his 
financial forecast unchanged on Wednesday and said the German national carrier still expected to match or 
surpass last year's record operating earnings in 2008.
Airlines must battle for survival as pressures rise
Lufthansa is one of the best hedged and most strongly capitalised airlines in the world, and for this year has the 
one-off advantage of a first 12-month consolidation of Swiss. Lufthansa and Air France have already led the 
consolidation process in Europe and remain the most likely predators.
Mr Mayrhuber said ominously that where other airlines were in trouble, Lufthansa would be looking to move in and 
"harvest" their markets.

ISEQ treads water despite Wall St gains

The ISEQ moved in and out of positive territory, failing to take the lead from a major rebound on Wall St as oil broke 
yet more records and inflation remained a big worry.
The index finished up just 5.78 points higher at 6,145.89.
Increasing pressure on inflation now means that hopes of a cut in interest rates by the ECB in the near term have 
all but evaporated. Market interest rates have been rising steadily due to recent hawkish comments from ECB 
officials, stubbornly high inflation and rising inflation expectations. The market is pricing less than 50pc of a 25 basis 
point rate cut this year.
 Shares in Athlone-based drug developer, Elan, shot up by 27c to E16.14 but fell back to E15.85 on profit taking 
after it told its AGM that it is on course to show a profit by 2010 when it will reach its sales targets for its MS 
treatment, Tysabri. Shares in Ryanair continued to fall and were down 3c to E2.55 as crude oil prices on the world 
market crashed through new record highs above USD132 a barrel. Ryanair shares fell 6.7pc yesterday, on the back 
of chief executive Michael O'Leary announcing his belief that oil prices would remain high for the "foreseeable 
future" and that the company would start hedging if oil falls below USD100 a barrel. "Oil is really hurting us now," he 
added and indicated that Ryanair would be at break even point for FY09 to March, if yields fall 5pc and oil rose to 
USD135 per barrel, noted Eamonn Hughes of Goodbody Stockbrokers. Aer Lingus shares dropped by 4c to E1.70. 
Banking shares continued to decline with AIB down 3c to E13.07, Bank of Ireland fell by 2c to E8.04, Anglo Irish 
declined by 6c to E8.77 and Irish Life and Permanent shed 10c to E10.75. Bank of Ireland shares are now at their 
lowest this year after it delivered in-line full year results on Wednesday. Davy research notes that the stock 
performed worse than its peers despite encouraging results and management comments. "The market is hard to 
please, however, and a lot of attention was put on the 8pc drop in the equity base to 662c (632c ex-goodwill) which 
we flagged on Wednesday as well as the observation that consensus (153c) is too high and needs to come down

perhaps by a mid/high single-digit percentage," said Scott Rankin. Shares in Paddy Power slumped by 30c to 
E22.45 despite some good numbers from the UK betting industry. Data from HM Revenue has shown that, in April, 
betting duties were up 16pc month-on-month and 20pc year on year. The data series can be erratic, according to 
Davy, not just for seasonal factors but also due to timing of duty payments. On a year-to-date basis, general betting 
duty was up 14pc. Building related stocks were mixed with CRH managing to gain 6c to E24.21 while Grafton 
slipped by 7c to E4.93 and Kingspan slumped by 11c to E7.25. CRH investors were encouraged by news that the 
US architectural billings index, a lead indicator of future non-residential construction activity, rose slightly in April to 
45.5 after falling to its lowest ever level in March (53.9). The US is the Irish company's largest single market.

Elan will turn a profit on an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation basis by end- 2008. He

Body
Carmakers hit reverse yesterday leading European equity markets into their second day of losses and erasing 
almost all of the gains made by the bourses since the start of May.
Crude oil hit fresh records, fuelling worries about inflation and drawing a clear line across Europe between the 
winners and losers of surging commodities prices.
The benchmark FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.7 per cent to 1,340.63 points as Germany's Xetra Dax was dragged lower 
1.1 per cent by car makers to 7,040.83 points. Bad news from the banking sector added further downward pressure 
on indices bringing losses since Tuesday to 2.7 per cent.
Merrill Lynch cut German luxury sports car maker Porsche from "neutral" to "sell", and the stock fell 4.9 per cent to 
EUR122, driving other carmakers lower. France's Peugeot slid 4.6 per cent to EUR41.79 and Renault dropped 3.3 
per cent to EUR64.73.
"Steel and oil prices keep going up,'' analyst Thomas Besson said, adding that with the dollar now holding steady 
against the euro, rising commodities prices could add up to "EUR4bn headwinds" for European carmakers.
"Our new 2009 earnings-per-share estimates are sharply lower than consensus for European automakers,'' Mr 
Besson said.
In Germany, Daimler fell 2.8 per cent to EUR50.93, BMW  dropped 4.3 per cent to EUR34.75 and VW  retreated 
1.2 per cent to EUR187.18 while car parts manufacturer Continental lost 2.8 per cent to EUR79.20.
Also among the losers were airline stocks, which continued to feel the pressure of rising oil costs with budget Irish 
carrier Ryanair  down 5.1 per cent to EUR2.62, Deutsche Lufthansa 3.1 per cent lower at EUR16.13, Air France-
KLM  dropping 3.5 per cent to EUR18.65 and Sweden's SAS sliding 2.2 per cent to SKr48.30.
Carmakers slam brakes on gains
Banking stocks were back in the doldrums after Swiss wealth manager UBS  said it had completed the sale of $15 
billion in real-estate related assets to New York based asset manager BlackRock. UBS dropped 3.5 per cent to 
SFr30.64.

Carmakers slam the brakes on bourses
Banking stocks were back in the doldrums after Swiss wealth manager UBS  said it had completed the sale of 
$15bn in real estate-related assets to New York-based asset manager BlackRock. UBS dropped 3.5 per cent to 
SFr30.64. Domestic rival Credit Suisse fell 2.2 per cent to SFr54.45.
In France, Natixis  dropped 5.1 per cent to EUR10.46 after Lehman Brothers cut its price target from EUR15 to 
EUR14.
Irish banks were lower after Bank of Ireland said its earnings would fall in the coming year, triggering a 5.9 per 
cent drop in the shares to EUR8.05. Anglo Irish Bank  dropped 6 per cent to EUR8.83.
Crowning the gainers were oil companies. Portugal's Galp Energia rose 5 per cent to EUR17.44 after energy 
groups clawed back lost ground following a sell-off on Tuesday when investors took profits. Austria's OMV rose 6.3 
per cent to EUR56.90.
Italian oilfield services group Saipem rose 2.7 per cent to EUR30.48 and French peer Technip gained 3.4 per cent 
to EUR62.22 after it said its Australian joint venture with Japan's Chiyoda and US company Fluor had won two 
contracts from Australia's Woodside Petroleum to carry out studies covering liquefied natural gas projects.
Also in France, Vallourec , which makes tubes used to build oil rigs and pipelines, gained 2.2 per cent to EUR198, 
mirroring the gleam in industrial metals stocks.
Austria's Voestalpine gained 0.4 per cent to EUR53.03, while Germany's Salzgitter  rose 0.7 per cent to 
EUR133.38 and Norwegian aluminium producer Norsk Hydro added 1.8 per cent to NKr83.40. France's 
ArcelorMittal  was up 0.8 per cent at EUR64.03.
The day's top gainer was Italian toll road operator Atlantia , which rose 7.6 per cent to EUR22.71 after Italian 
authorities took emergency steps to approve concession rules between Atlantia and state-owned highway operator 
ANAS. The move paves the way for future tariff increases.

A surge in oil prices to yet another record high spooked Irish and global investors this morning amid fears over 
rising inflation.
By midday, the ISEQ was down 40.81 points to 6,284.25.
Bank of Ireland was the main focus of attention this morning after it delivered mostly in-line results for the full year. 
Shares climbed by 16c to E8.71 in morning trade. Underlying profit before tax for the financial year to March 31 was 
6pc higher than the previous year at E1.79 billion. Growth at the same time last year was 28pc. The bank says this 
is a satisfactory performance in 'difficult market conditions'. Underlying earnings per share were up 4pc at 150.3 
cent, in line with expectations. Bank of Ireland said the results had come against a background of volatility on world 
financial markets and slowing economic growth.
 The other financials put in a less impressive performance with AIB shares down 27c to E13.33, Anglo Irish 
slumped by 39c to E9.00 and Irish Life and Permanent fell by 39c to E11.01. Shares in financial services group, 
IFG, edged up 1c to E2.21 after it announced that it had completed a 4.91pc placing at E2.10 per share (the stock 
closed at E2.14 on Monday), raising E7.2m before expenses. "The net proceeds are to fund "probable acquisitions" 
and we suspect that in the current credit climate IFG's bankers wanted to see the placing completed before they 
were prepared to provide any debt financing," according to Anna Lalor of Goodbody Stockbrokers. Oil hit a record 
USD130.30 as the dollar remained weak and as fund interest picked up after several investment banks and major 
market players upgraded their price predictions. The relentless rise in the price of crude this year so far especially is 
a growing worry for investors concerned about the effects on corporate bottom lines and on the Irish and global 
economies. While the business models and strategies to cope with the fuels cost rise of both of Ireland's listed 
airlines, Ryanair and Aer Lingus, have been assessed by analysts as being strong enough to withstand the crisis, 
jet fuel remains the biggest cost for both. Shares in Ryanair slumped by 10c to E2.66 while Aer Lingus stocks 
ISEQ heads lower as oil prices surge
dropped by 2c to E1.79. Ryanair will release its full-year results next month. It has guided E470m net income for the 
full year 2008, "a figure that we expect it to beat based on its conservative fourth quarter yield guidance of -5pc (our 
forecasts are E471.3m pre-exceptional net income, earnings per share 30.8c)," according to Stephen Furlong of 
Davy Research. Building related shares also mostly dragged on the index with CRH down 30c to E24.25, Grafton 
edged up by 4c to E5.20 while Kingspan declined by 15c to E7.35. US builders' suppliers and DIY giant, Home 
Depot reported a disappointing set of first quarter results which fell short of the street's expectations. The group 
reported earnings per share of USD0.21, well shy of the consensus estimate of USD0.37, and the stock fell 5pc 
overnight as a result. CRH derives just over half its group revenues from the US.

The Dublin market lost close to 3pc in value - roughly E2.7 billion - as Bank of Ireland shares plunged on 
pessimistic forecasts for its earnings prospects this year.
The index was down 173.39 points to 6,151.67.
Shares in bank of Ireland tumbled by 2.9pc or 25c to E8.30 after it delivered an in-line set of full year 2007 results 
but indicated that this year could see a fall in earnings thanks to falling demand for loans, the global and domestic 
economic slowdown and the slump in the property market.
 The other financials reflected the gloomy forecasts for the banking sector with AIB shares tumbling 30c to E13.30, 
Anglo Irish slumped by 42c to E8.97 and Irish Life and Permanent fell by 45c to E10.95. Shares in financial services 
group, IFG, edged up 1c to E2.21 after it announced that it had completed a 4.91pc share placing at E2.10 per 
share (the stock closed at E2.14 on Monday), raising E7.2m before expenses. "The net proceeds are to fund

Stockbrokers. Meanwhile, a new surge in oil prices to yet another record high spooked Irish and global investors 
and sparked fresh fears over rising inflation. Oil hit a record USD132 a barrel yesterday as the dollar remained 
weak and as fund interest picked up after several investment banks and major market players upgraded their price 
predictions. The relentless rise in the price of crude this year so far especially is a growing worry for investors 
concerned about the effects on corporate bottom lines and on the Irish and global economies. While the business

share of USD0.21, well shy of the consensus estimate of USD0.37, and the stock fell 5pc overnight as a result. 
CRH derives just over half its group revenues from the US. Athlone drug developer, Elan, was among the few 
gainers of the day and saw its shares jump by 49c to E16.36 ahead of its AGM in the US later today. Davy said that 
indications are that the group will have some good news on its joint venture with Wyeth on its pipeline 
Bapineuzumab treatment for Alzheimer's.

Growing fears about inflation weighed on European stock markets on Tuesday as mining stocks snapped their four-
day winning streak.
After reaching its highest level in four months on Monday, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 2 per cent to 1,350.54, its 
biggest single-day drop in the last eight weeks.
Stocks lost ground in early trade after surging energy prices boosted German producer price inflation to a 20-month 
high in April and took a further hit after data showed an uptick in core US wholesale inflation in April.
Mining stocks in London led the market south, taking the shine off industrial metals stocks across the Channel.

Ryanair Holdings PLC welcomed the High Court's decision on its appeal of the Commission for Aviation 
Regulation's (CAR's) Interim Determination on airport charges at Dublin Airport.
The Court found that there was 'clear ambiguity' in the CAR's determination and that Ryanair was justified in 
bringing the claim.
Ryanair claims the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) has allowed a 50 percent hike in check-in desk charges and a 
doubling of charges for check-in kiosks at Dublin airport.
The Court Tuesday ordered the CAR to clarify its treatment of some 1.2 billion euros of capital expenditure in its 
interim review and the CAR has now confirmed that this figure has been included in the regulated asset base 
(RAB), which will lead to a doubling of passenger charges at Dublin Airport.
The Court also found that the Minister for Transport was wrong in not allowing Ryanair to appeal the inclusion of 
this 1.2 billion euros.
Ryanair is therefore again calling on the Minister to establish an Appeals Panel with a view to removing this 
spending from the RAB.

Ryanair's legal challenge to the Commission for Aviation Regulation's 2007 interim review of capital spending at 
Dublin Airport has been rejected.
Ryanair had launched a legal challenge to the Commission's decision last July on the treatment of the costs of 
Dublin Airport's 2006-2009 capital investment plan.
Most of the E1.2 billion plan deals with the cost of building a second terminal at the airport.
 The High Court said that Ryanair had failed to demonstrate that the Commission's decision suffered from legal 
flaws or a lack of a process or any of the other claimed defects. The Commissioner for Aviation Regulation, Cathal 
Guiomard, has welcomed the decision, saying that court challenges to economic regulatory decisions are relatively 
uncommon and points out that the UK airport regulator has never been challenged in the courts in 25 years.

Ringing through the centuries, Frédéric Chopin's music comes to us like a message from a contemporary who 
landed somehow in another century - subtle and sweet as jazz, dry and disciplined as the most modernist electronic 
text.
He was a poor kid from Poland who took the coach to Paris just as his contemporaries take the Ryanair flight to 
Dublin today.
He was obviously brilliant and went crazy - like everyone else in Warsaw, but more so - for the music of Paganini, 
composing a mouthwatering delicate series of variations on a tone he heard the great violinist play.
The Composer of the Week series on BBC Radio 3 prepared us for the weekend with a series on Chopin. And 
Radio 3's The Chopin Experience this weekend broadcasts every note the composer ever wrote, interspersed with 
news and gossip about his life. Fabulous.
* A house looking out over the sea from a terrace in the South of France. What more could anyone want?
Furniture designer Eileen Gray, a Wexford émigré whose work is typical of the stark beauty of the 1920s,brought 
her vision to life with a house called &EURO;1027,a secret name that coded Gray's name with her lover Jean 
Badovici's in a numeric secret key.
In The Architect's Eye on Tuesday, Barbara Kenny, Senior Architect with the Office of Public Works, described the 
house in terms that must have made every listener want to move in immediately.
It's still a 'site moderne' under French law - but largely because Gray's busybody friend Le Corbusier added his own 
murals in an act of cultural vandalism. Gray's beautiful furniture and fittings are largely gone.
Once, it had a living room with ''great windows open to the south'', and tiles that spread from the room out on to a 
terrace, so that the windows could be thrown open on fine days to extend the living area into the open air.
Radio review: Chopin weekend provides classic classical radio
The balcony had a balustrade, and billowing canopies could be floated above it to make the house echo the look of 
sailing ships.
Gray must have been a decent employer - her maid, Louise Dany, served her for most of her life - but she carefully 
set a pillar off-centre to block the view from the maid's room, so she couldn't be watching the quality at their 
shenanigans.
This was the last of an interesting series - but they go out with a contest. You can win a weekend away in any of the 
Irish Landmark Trust buildings by sending an e-mail to architect@rte.ie nominating your favourite Irish building and 
giving a 100-word reason why it's your favourite.
* Put the last day of May in your diary - that's when The Sweet Smell of Cigarette Smoke by Julie Parsons is 
broadcast on BBC World Service in Worldplay. It's a play about a woman with the ultimate sense of smell, and the 
husband who thinks he can get away with infidelity because his lover, like him, is a smoker. Wrong, boy .
Worldplay is a programme in which six original plays for radio from around the world are shared by broadcasters, 
giving the writers international listenership and the listeners a chance to hear fine work from abroad.
The plays are accompanied by interviews and introductions about the writer and the play - a bit of underwear-
showing that I didn't much like, but actors will love it.
This year the six writers are from Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the US and Britain.
Last Saturday's play was The Shawl by David Mamet, thrilling and touching and scary at the same time. A would-be 
'psychic' teaches his lover the tricks of the trade as he spoofs a young woman who wants to contact her dead 
mother.
But is he really as un-psychic as he pretends? By the end of Mamet's play, neither he nor the listener knows.
The psychic is played with perfect pacing, force and tendresse by John Mahoney, who played Frasier's dad on TV. 
Shivery.

Aer Arann turns to leasing amid rising costs

After losing the Dublin-Kerry route, the airline has new plans, writes Gavin Daly.
When Aer Arann last week lost the government contract to operate flights between Dublin and Kerry, the airline 
already had a plan in place - it will lease the plane that operated the Kerry route to a British airline from June 1.
The plane is one of two Aer Arann aircraft that will go into service in Britain, while another plane belonging to the 
Irish airline is already operating in Finland. The moves highlight a shift in Aer Arann's business, from a pure 
passenger-carrier into the so-called 'wet lease' business, where it provides aircraft, crews and maintenance to other 
airlines.
Fergal Barry, commercial director of Aer Arann, said there was a number of factors behind the move - the airline 
has a new fleet of propeller aircraft, which are in demand worldwide, and there is a ''good margin'' to be made in the 
wet lease business. "We have found a good use for it," Barry said of the plane that previously operated the Kerry 
route.
He would not comment on the identity of the British airline that is leasing the Aer Arann planes, but said one lease 
was for 15 months and one for six months. "There is a huge scarcity of our type of aircraft, so it is a good time to 
have capacity," said Barry.
Ironically, the latest lease opportunity only arose because Aer Arann lost the contract to run the so-called Public 
Service Obligation (PSO) route between Dublin and Kerry to rival Ryanair. Barry said the airline was ''sorry to lose'' 
the Kerry route, which carried subsidies of about  3 million a year for the last three years.
However, he said reports that the airline made  3 million profit on the route were inaccurate. "Of course, it is a 
lucrative route and it was good to have it, but it is not  3 million of bottom line, or anything like it. With the PSOs, you 
go in with the full knowledge that you might come out with nothing."
Aer Arann turns to leasing amid rising costs
Aer Arann will continue to operate PSO services between Dublin and Galway, Dublin and Sligo, and Dublin and 
Donegal. It also won the Dublin to Derry contract for the first time. Barry said that the Derry route was less lucrative 
than the Kerry route, but the airline was ''very happy'' overall with the outcome of the PSO process.
He said that the airline had ''contingency plans'' prepared, in case the PSO awards did not go its way. "Had we lost 
Galway as well as Kerry, it would have been more difficult to cope with," said Barry. "We would have to look at the 
business again."
However, he acknowledged that Aer Arann - which has 400 staff and annual revenues of more than  100 million - 
was still facing challenges on several fronts. ''A number of crises have come all at once for the aviation industry," he 
said.
''We are finding it very difficult out there, there is no doubt." Barry's worries range from broad economic issues to 
the falling value of sterling, rising fuel prices and new environmental taxes.
Competition from Ryanair and others is also intense, while customers have come to expect low prices, particularly 
on short-haul flights. "When oil was at $100 [a barrel], analysts were calling it a spike,'' Barry said. "What will they 
be calling it at $200?"
While Aer Arann hedged its fuel costs late last year, the hedging will expire in about two months and the airline is 
considering its options. "We are joining the queue with everyone else," according to Barry, who said that hedging at 
$110 a barrel was one option.
Barry knows all about the dangers facing smaller players in the aviation sector - Aer Arann was leasing a plane to 
Euro Manx in the Isle of Man, but it ceased operations last week after five years in business.
''Over the last six months, a number of factors, including rising fuel prices and reduced passenger numbers, have 
proved to be insurmountable obstacles to the airline being able to continue to operate," Euro Manx said on its 
website.
While Barry said that Aer Arann planned to expand its passenger services, the make-up of the airline's business 
has changed significantly with a ''break-in strategy'' in the past year. Its recent announcements have included 
routes from Waterford and Galway to Malaga, Faro, Amsterdam and Bordeaux, but those routes are actually not 
operated by Aer Arann aircraft or crews.
Instead, Nex Aviation, run by a group of Waterford businessmen, has leased planes that use Aer Arann's branding 
and booking system on the continental routes. The ''franchise-type operation'' allows Aer Arann to avoid commercial 
risk but make good use of its IT infrastructure, including its online booking system, said Barry.
He said that the airline's future plans were designed to tap into a market of people who did not want to travel from 
Dublin or Cork. There are also plans to boost the firm's brand and business in Britain.
''We're working on a couple of significant projects at the moment, interesting things that should lead to major load 
factor growth," according to Barry.
Despite the challenges, and the loss of the Kerry route, Barry said Aer Arann would be profitable this year. He 
would not comment on a profit forecast, but said the figure should be ''steady'' on last year. Barry also refused to 
comment on the future financing plans for the airline, which is still owned by businessman Padraig O'Ceidigh.
Accurate financial information for the airline is difficult to find, as Aer Arann Group reregistered as an unlimited 
company in late 2005, so it does not have to file publicly-available accounts. Its holding company, Blueberry Ltd, is 
registered in the Isle Of Man.
Documents filed at the Companies Registration Office in 2005 - signed by directors Padraig O'Ceidigh and Caitlin 
Ui Cheidigh - said it was ''in the best interests'' of the firm to be unlimited. Aer Arann has said its turnover rose 6 per 
cent last year, and was ''in excess of  100 million'', but a more specific figure is not available.
Aer Arann turns to leasing amid rising costs
Those figures meant that growth has slowed at Aer Arann - in 2004, the last year for which accounts are available, 
it had turnover of  70.2 million, up sharply from just under  43 million in 2003. After-tax profits rose to  6.6 million in 
2004, from  2.3million the previous year.
The 2003 and 2004 figures would have included about  15million each year from the PSO subsidies. For the 
12months from July 22 last to July 21 this year, the airline will receive  11.4million in PSO subsidies - about 10 per 
cent of its turnover. With the loss of the Kerry route, the figure will be lower in future years.
While the PSO routes form a much smaller part of Aer Arann's business than in the past, one aviation analyst 
described them as ''a very, very material component'' of the airline's business. Losing the Kerry route means one 
more headache in an already difficult environment.
Aer Arann diversifies Originally founded to run flights to the Aran Islands, Aer Arann now operates more than 600 
flights a week on 40 routes between Ireland, Britain and the continent.
Headed by former Aer Lingus chief executive Garry Cullen, it carried 1.15 million passengers last year. In 2006, the 
airline struck a $180 million deal to buy ten new ATR 72500 propeller aircraft. It took delivery of the first two last 
year. It will receive five more this year and the final two next year, according to commercial director Fergal Barry.
He said the ATRs were more fuel-efficient than competing aircraft and less harmful to the ozone, because they fly 
at lower altitudes. International demand for ATRs is high, leading to a shortage of planes and allowing Aer Arann to 
develop the leasing side of its business.
A firm called Arann Aircraft Leasing was incorporated in March last year, according to documents at the Companies 
Registration Office. Its business is to ''acquire, finance, own, lease and sublease aircraft, aircraft parts and aircraft 
engines in any part of the world''.
In effect, the airline's change in strategy in the past year means that there are Aer Arann-branded planes operating 
from Waterford and Galway that do not belong to the airline, while planes owned by Aer Arann are flying under 
different livery in Britain and Finland.

Munster's success in reaching the Heineken Cup final is being felt by ferry companies, airlines and travel agents, as 
tens of thousands of fans aim to get to Cardiff for the game against Toulouse next Saturday.
Irish Ferries is expecting to carry about 10,000 fans in the days leading up to the game, while Ryanair, despite a 
well-publicised ''scheduling error'', will carry tens of thousands more. The match is a huge financial boost for Cardiff, 
with hotels, bars and shops all expecting healthy profits from the weekend's visitors.
And it's not just Cardiff that will benefit - 40,000 Munster fans are expected to descend on Limerick city during the 
game, when two of the biggest TV screens in Europe will be put up on O'Connell Street.
Close to 20,000 people crammed the city's streets to watch the broadcast of the final in 2006 - which Munster won - 
and organisers of this year's event say the number could easily be double that next weekend.
Hotels in Limerick are reporting healthy bookings already for the weekend, with fans expected to travel from all 
around the country.
Munster's progress may also be having an impact on other aspects of Irish rugby, with attendances at Magners 
League games continuing to improve, according to Celtic Rugby.
''In what has been a successful season for the Magners League, which has seen Leinster emphatically claim the 
title and Munster reach the final of the Heineken Cup, the growth in attendances across the board this season at 
Magners League games shows that fans are endorsing the exciting style of rugby on offer," said David Jordan, the 
director of Celtic Rugby.
Despite a slight decrease in crowds in the earlier part of the season, attributed to the Rugby World Cup in France, 
like-for-like attendances at Magners League games this season have increased 2.5 per cent on last year.
Munster generate an economic heave
Average match attendances were up 13 per cent from 6,011 last year to 6,791,while was almost 52,000 more 
people had passed through the turnstiles by the end of round 18.

If we want a lean and more efficient public sector, why are the jobs pages littered with civil service positions?
Have you noticed the language used by employment agencies these days? Every dream job is exciting, attractive 
and offers a ''once in a lifetime'' opportunity to change your life. Every ideal candidate needs to be bright, creative 
and energetic.
Sometimes, you'd be forgiven for thinking you're reading a lonely hearts column. Effusiveness aside, the jobs' 
pages do offer a snapshot of the economy.
As this column is based on the most rigorous and up-to-date economic measurement techniques, let's look at one 
of the country's most prominent jobs' supplements this week, to read a few economic tea leaves. Every Friday, the 
Irish Times jobs' section purports to host the best jobs in the land, and as it claims to be read by nine out of ten 
senior business people, this section offers us a glimpse of what is available at the top of the tree.
If the Economic and Social Research Institute's (ESRI) latest prognosis is to be believed, and Ireland is set to 
become a lean, fit machine with a pared down, stream-lined public sector and a dynamic service exporting sector, 
we would hope to see some indication of this in the jobs' pages. An economy that is on the cusp of an exporting 
boom, in the creative services sector, must surely be looking for senior managers to execute this.
So, I counted all the big headline ads in the jobs section on Friday, expecting to see evidence of dynamism. The 
good news is that there were plenty of jobs - twelve pages in all. The bad news is that 85 per cent of them were for 
public sector positions. Admittedly, I only counted the larger, expensive looking ads, as they are obviously designed 
to catch the eye.
In all, there were a respectable 77 ads for senior positions. Astonishingly, 66 of these were in the public sector. 
Apart from an isolated Ryanair ad, one for Pfizer and a couple from financial institutions, practically every position 
was either for the civil service, one of the universities, public bodies or a variety of different state 'agencies' that 
have been set up in the past few years.
A very public problem
Who is going to pay for these people? Think about the figure again - 85 per cent of the jobs advertised this week 
are in the very sector that we are supposed to be cutting back on. In fact, in the first eight pages of the jobs' 
supplement, there were only five private sector jobs. This is a joke.
For an economy that is trying to avoid being completely dragged down by the most wasteful property boom the 
western world has seen in years, the last thing we need is for the public sector to be expanding.
This article is not a rant against the public sector; countries need strong public sectors, staffed by talented people. 
The issue at stake here, is to understand what is happening in our country - and our labour market.
'The Irish Times Job Ratio' - to give my ramblings a grandiose title - suggests that there are eight times more senior 
jobs being sought by the public sector than the private sector. So, we are having a recession in one part of the 
economy - the part that earns money - and a boom in the other part of the economy - the part that spends money.
This is a recipe for bankruptcy. To achieve the economy which the ESRI wrote about the other day, it seems logical 
to suggest that the Irish Times Jobs Ratio ('ITJR') should be going the other way.
If this continues, Ireland will be faced with a serious twin deficit, as the current account deficit balloons further and 
the budget deficit explodes. Just a word of warning from the past: in the early 1990s, when Finland experienced a 
property market collapse, its budget deficit went from a surplus of 2 per cent of GDP (the value of all final goods 
and services produced in a nation in a given year) during its boom, to a deficit of 11 per cent of GDP when the 
economy slowed.
The reason for this was that the entire budget strategy was geared to the property market, and the resulting surge 
in consumer spending, which itself was driven by enormous personal borrowing.
A figure published by the Central Statistics Office this week reveals that we are in a very similar position. According 
to the statisticians, total personal indebtedness in Ireland is now running at EUR 194 billion.
About EUR 140 billion of this is in mortgages, leaving an outstanding EUR 50 billion odd in debts built up to buy 
cars, holidays and Jimmy Choos. If we add the indebtedness of Irish firms to this figure, we get a total private sector 
debt figure, at the end of March, of EUR 384 billion (published by the Central Bank).This is well over twice our GDP 
figure.
When people are borrowing so much money, it is easy to run a budget surplus, simply because so much of this 
borrowed cash finds its way back into the government's coffers in taxation. The corollary is also true. When the 
borrowing stops, tax dries up and the budget plummets into deficit.
Therefore, the Irish government's budget - the figure so many commentators get worked up about - is only a 
residual in the equation. When the people are borrowing, the surplus is huge; and when people are not borrowing, 
the deficit is huge. So, we should expect the mother of all deficits in the years ahead, as the main engines for 
revenue, house price taxation and consumer spending, fall away.
Last week, we saw further evidence from both of these crucial areas. Retail sales fell by 2 per cent in March, while 
the first-time buyers market has ground to a halt. This situation is likely to get worse. Who would buy a house now?
Another interesting figure that came out recently, is equally worrying. In the first quarter, the buy-to-let mortgage 
market grew by EUR 1.1 billion. Now, who is taking out these mortgages? In the past, the buy-to-let market was 
driven by small-time, amateur investors, who bought on the expectation of ever-increasing house prices. As this 
chimera evaporated, so too has this type of investor - who, during the boom, accounted for over 27 per cent of the 
total mortgage market. So, who is buying now?
Worryingly, the only buyers in town are those who have to buy. It is, therefore, not inconceivable that the people 
who are buying to let are the very people who own these apartments in the first place - the developers. This is a 
hunch, but if it turns out to be true, we are in for an awful ride in the next two years, because this is not borrowing 
from Peter to pay Paul, it is borrowing from Paul to pay Paul.
A very public problem
All the while, the ITJR points to recession and a bloated apparatchik class who spend, rather than earn. If you want 
a quick snapshot of the economy and to see beyond all the blather, all you have to do is scan the ITJR every 
Friday. At the moment, the ratio is 8:1 for the public sector.
No economy ever got rich by expanding the government's payroll, so now, the ITJR is saying that we will fall off a 
cliff. Let's watch the ITJR every week from here on, to see where the economy is actually headed, rather than 
where some people would like to see it go.

British Airways Plc plans to ground part of its fleet from October to cut costs and stem potential losses caused by 
soaring fuel prices, the Sunday Times newspaper reported, citing chief executive Willie Walsh.
Scheduled airlines rarely ground aircraft, preferring to keep their expensive fleets in the air, although Ryanair has 
kept planes on the ground during slack periods.
Walsh said: 'You should certainly expect us to do that this winter.'
BA plans to park its oldest, least fuel-efficient aircraft and this may include Boeing 747s, 767s and 737s, Walsh

Barclaycard Business, the card processing arm of British bank Barclays, is to enter the Irish card processing 
market, where it will compete with AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank.
Steve Lappin, Barclaycard Business country manager for Ireland, said that the move would not create any new jobs 
in the short term at its Dublin office, but as the company expanded its Irish business new staff would probably be 
hired.
Lappin said Ryanair and Dunnes Stores, both of whom have operations in Britain, had been signed up as 
customers.
The company was already marketing itself amongst Irish retailers, and Ireland would be the first of several 
European markets the firm plans to enter, Lappin said.
While there are nine card issuers operating in the Irish market, at present AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank are 
the only financial institutions who act as card acquirers.
Card acquirers provide card payment terminals to retailers and will arrange payment for the merchant while 
receiving payment from the card issuer.
Lappin declined to reveal exactly how much Barclaycard Business would be billing merchants for its services, but 
did stress that it would be a very competitive offering.

JIM PARKER
Justin Baer on the Raymond James analyst, who stays down to earth
Body
There is no jet fuel in Jim Parker's veins.
Mr Parker, an analyst with Raymond James, the US financial services holding company, is not an amateur pilot. 
And when airline executives he has known and covered over the years have approached him with job offers, he has 
politely declined.
"I don't care about aeroplanes," Mr Parker says. "I just care about picking stocks and making money. Airlines just 
happen to be the sector I cover."
Clients are thankful Mr Parker holds no romantic notions toward an industry that, more than 50 years after the start 
of the Jet Age, still manages to steal the hearts - and often dent the returns - of many investors.
His track record for steering clients toward the stocks worthy of their affection has garnered Mr Parker this year's 
FT/StarMine Award for Excellence in Investment Analysis.
StarMine has honoured Mr Parker 11 times since it began rating US analysts in 2001. This year, he was one of only 
14 - out of a pool of more than 1,900 eligible analysts - to earn five stars in both picking stocks and forecasting 
earnings.
Mr Parker focuses on so-called growth airlines: the upstarts that have emerged to challenge legacy carriers in the 
years following commercial aviation's deregulation.
Today his "outperform" recommendations include Panama's Copa Holdings and Allegiant Travel, which ferries 
small-town Americans to vacation spots in Las Vegas and Florida. His top pick is Ryanair, which he rates a "strong 
buy".
No flights of fantasy for airlines veteran
Mr Parker's research career began in 1968, when he joined Robinson-Humphrey, an investment banking boutique. 
He would give it 10 years, Mr Parker thought at the time, then return to school to pursue a PhD.
He stuck with that plan, earning his doctorate in marketing from the University of Georgia, but soon found he 
preferred the immediacy of stock research to the more measured academic world.
Mr Parker's route to the airlines industry was equally unconventional.
He was covering express-delivery companies when Robinson's investment bankers told Mr Parker about a client 
who needed the firm's help in raising $5m to start a commuter airline.
It was 1982, just four years after the US industry's deregulation, and only one upstart - Southwest Airlines - had 
managed to find a lasting niche in a market dominated by legacy carriers such as American Airlines.
The start-up, Atlantic Southeast Airlines, needed research coverage, and the task fell to Mr Parker. ASA, which flies 
commuter jets for Delta Air Lines, is now a unit of SkyWest.
By the 1990s, many more commuter and low-cost carriers had joined Southwest in taking on the behemoths. "They 
brought affordable air travel to the masses," says Mr Parker.
In focusing on this nascent market, Mr Parker had found his own niche, too. "Some of the best things in life happen 
to you by accident," he says.
Twenty-six years later, Mr Parker still follows the same subset of airlines, including Southwest, which remains the 
US's biggest low-cost carrier. But along the way, he says, entrepreneurs from Ireland to Brazil have imported the 
Southwest model to their home countries.
"My investor clients are now looking for growth airline situations all around the world," he says.
For Mr Parker, the search for the next Southwest clone has meant spending a lot of time on aircraft; he has racked 
up 4.5m miles on his frequent-flyer account with Delta.

Shares in the housebuilder McInerney shares edged 1c higher to 748, despite its agm admission today that it will 
report first half losses.
It is predicting full year profits, though it admits this is dependent to a large degree on how the housing market 
goes.
The slight gain in its shares yesterday probably had less to do with the prospects for profit this year and more with 
the fact that the builder has clearly declared war on costs within its operations.
 It says that its top priority now is to position itself to take best advantage of a recovery in the housing sector when it 
eventually comes. For the moment investors seem to buy the story. Other stocks in the building sector had a 
decidedly mixed day. The country's other quoted housebuilder Abbey was flat at 545, while building materials giant 
CRH was down by 11c to 2359. Insulation specialist Kingspan warmed the hearts of investors yesterday by also 
coming clean on the reduced earnings. It pointed out, however, that not all the news was bad and its shares gained 
3c to 748. The mixed fortunes of construction stocks came on what was overall a very up-and-down day for the 
Dublin market. The ISEQ index of Irish shares bobbed in and out of the red through the session , but a late rally 
took it to 6,424.17, or 31.67 points ahead for the session. Shares in London also lacked direction for much of the 
day, but also rose towards the close to end 0.6 percent ahead on the day. Back in Dublin, Aer Lingus shares gained 
2c to 187 after it too issued a trading statement warning about - you've guessed it - uncertain times ahead. Stephen 
Furlong of Davy Stockbrokers noted that most of the information in it was already known, such as falling load 
factors and growing capacity. He pointed out that most of the uncertainty around airlines is currently centred on high 
fuel prices and, ominously for passengers, he saw "some limited capacity to pass this through". Ryanair shares, 
meanwhile, dropped by 2c mto 286. In the financial sector, the big news of the day was an interim management 
statement from AIB, which predicted that first half earnings per share are likely to be down by 6pc compared with 
ISEQ ahead by 31 points after late rally
last year. With other banks leaking billions, it sounded like a pretty good performance. The state said the bank had 
"acted quickly" to keep costs down. Its shares ended the day 11c up at 1371. Its big rival Bank of Ireland had a less 
positive day, with its shares dipping by 2c to 874. Anglo irish Bank gained 6c to 946, while insurer FBD gained 
another 37c to reach 2692 on continuing takeover talk. Packaging group Smurfit Kappa advanced by 22c to 772 
after selling an Austrian affiliate for 55m euro. In the food sector, fruit importer Fyffes was down 6c to 79, while cider 
maker C&C dipped 2c to 534. Among the food biggies there was a 24c gain tio 2003 in the shares of Kerry Group 
while Glabia shed 14c to 506 and Greencore gained 3c to 345. DCC was off by 13c to 1499, drugs company Elan 
dipped 13c to 1762 and clinical trials company Icon was down by 25c to 4775. AIB up 11 to 1371

## Davy Stockbrokers is to spend 35m euro to fund the purchase of a new investment product by credit unions, in 
settlement of a row over the performance of previous investments they made. Davy say this product will provide a 
return - based on today's prices - over the next 10 years which will make up any shortfall caused by a drop in the 
value of the perpetual bonds they previously bought.The brokers say they have agreed the new purchases with the 
Irish League of Credit Unions. It is understood the cost has been fully provided in Davy's 2007 accounts. Earlier this 
year,Davy took legal action against the Financial Services Ombudsman after he ruled that the sale of the bonds to 
one credit union was unsuitable. Davy still intends to go ahead with this case. - Irish Times 
## A receiver appointed to Cork-based firm Hormann Electronics has told staff he hopes to be in a position to make 
an announcement on the future of the plant by the end of the week. The company, which is based at Blackrock in 
Cork city, employs approximately 130 people. Production is continuing at present despite the company's recent 
difficulties. Hormann Electronics has been assembling and testing printed circuit boards at the plant for more than 
30 years. The company has gone through a number of name changes and buy-outs. The firm was the subject of a 
management buy-out in 2005, when it embarked on a E2.5m capital investment programme. But faced with 
competition from Eastern Europe and the Far East, Hormann Electronics ran into financial difficulty in recent 
months and joint receivers were appointed last week on foot of financial losses. - RTE
 ## Ryanair has offered to fly rugby fans to Wales for free after a "scheduling error" meant a flight on the Heineken 
Cup final weekend would no longer land in time for kick-off. Hundreds of Munster fans pre-booked the 6.50am flight 
from Dublin to Bristol (FR506) earlier this year in the hope their team would make the final in Cardiff on May 24, 
paying less than 50 euro before taxes. But, in late March, Ryanair told passengers that the departure time was 
being changed to 3pm. With Cardiff 70km from Bristol and kick-off at 5pm, many fans took the refund offered.

However, flight FR506 was reinstated earlier this month -- after Munster qualified -- at 6.50am on May 24, with fares 
before taxes of 229.99 euro. The Commission for Aviation Regulation said that the action appeared to be "a cynical, 
commercial exercise" and it is being investigated by the National Consumer Agency. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary 
told Newstalk fans could fly to Wales for free "if they write into me before the end of this week". - Irish Independent 
## Independent News and Media chief executive Tony O'Reilly received a 20pc pay hike last year, the company's

salary of 980,000 euro and a performance bonus of 750,000 euro. The rest of his pay consisted of pension 
contributions of 450,000 euro and other perks and fees. The total amount paid to IN and M directors, rose to 11.6 m 
euro in 2007 from 10.5m euro in 2006. After O'Reilly, the next highest paid director was Brendan Hopkins, whose 
pay rose to 2.04m euro from 1.92m euro. Mr Hopkins runs APN News and Media, the Australian company in which 
IN and M has a 40pc stake. Ivan Fallon, who runs Independent's British operations, saw his pay rise from 1.43m 
euro to 1.66m euro. Gavin O'Reilly, the company's chief operating officer and O'Reilly's son, saw his pay rise to 
1.53m euro from 1.4m euro. - Irish Examiner ## A Bank of Ireland laptop with thousands of customers' details was 
stolen seven years ago in Co Kildare and clients were not informed, it has emerged. The bank says it is 
investigating the matter. The development comes as the bank faces two separate investigations following the 
disclosure that laptops containing the details of 31,000 customers were stolen last year. The newly revealed theft

The National Consumer Agency (NCA) has asked Ryanair to explain why flights from Dublin to Bristol on the day of 
the Heineken Cup final were rescheduled twice - and then increased hugely in price.
Munster will play Toulouse in the rugby final in Cardiff on May 24. Some fans had booked flights to Bristol as early 
as last January, in the hope that the Irish team would reach the tie. The seats cost as little as  49 at the time.
However, on March 27, passengers who had booked seats on the 6.50am flight to Bristol on the day of the final, 
received letters advising them this flight was rescheduled to 3pm. The passengers were offered seats on a new 
flight or a full refund.
The Heineken Cup final kicks off at 5pm at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, which is 40 minutes by train from 
Bristol. Some passengers felt they would not have reached the stadium on time, and accepted the refund from 
Ryanair.
However, in recent weeks, the 6.50am flight to Bristol has been reinstated, with tickets priced at up to  229. One 
passenger who had accepted the Ryanair refund, Terri Kiernan, said she was very annoyed with the airline's action.
''They just seem to be taking advantage of the fans, and that's very unfair," she said. Kiernan and her husband had 
booked seats with Ryanair on January 27, but changed their plans after the flight was rescheduled. They have 
since booked flights to Birmingham, but will have to hire a car and drive two hours to Cardiff.
''I am very annoyed with Ryanair for what they did and the extra expense we have incurred with the car," Kiernan 
said.
John Shine, director of commercial practices with the NCA, said the agency had raised the matter with Ryanair and 
wanted a full explanation.

A spokeswoman for Ryanair said that two flights had been incorrectly scheduled to leave Dublin for Bristol on the

to demand, this flight was rescheduled back to 6.50am, and more than 50 passengers chose to avail of early 
morning departure for less than  50. We are not in the business of ripping off Munster fans," she said.

Cabanas de Tavira is a little known fishing village in the eastern Algarve where property is much more affordable 
than its western counterpart.
Situated in an old orchard near the village is the latest scheme by Irish developers Newlyn.
O Pomar will comprise 2 52 apartments and townhouse when complete, and is within five minutes' drive of the 
historic city of Tavira, which dates back to the 8th century BC. It is also within half an hour's drive of Faro airport, 
from where both Aer Lingus and Ryanair fly direct to Dublin throughout the year.
Known as the Algarve's little Venice, the city of Tavira has long narrow cobbled streets that run alongside the banks 
of the river Gilao.
The eastern coast of the Algarve is relatively unknown to most Irish investors, but offers a more affordable option 
for property investment compared to the more developed western Algarve. The stretch of coast from Faro to the 
Spanish border is refreshingly unspoilt and rural, and retains its traditional Portuguese ambience and architecture.
Construction density limits in the Algarve are set at 8 per cent, guaranteeing preservation of the natural 
environment. O Pomar is low-rise, as are the other schemes in the area.
The development has a mix of two and three-bedroom apartments and three-bedroom townhouses. Newlyn hired 
renowned international leisure architects WATG to design a master plan for O Pomar, and Portuguese architects 
were employed to design the scheme in a traditional Portuguese style with a central village square.
The mix of two and three-bedroom apartments and three-bedroom townhouses are laid out in low-rise buildings set 
within gardens which retain some of the orange, almond and olive trees from the original orchard.
Dublin-based selling agent Splash International is marketing the development, with prices starting from  225,000.
Apartments and houses in picturesque Cabanas
The two-bedroom apartments at O Pomar are priced from  225,000. The three-bedroom townhouses are available 
from  380,000.
The units measure between 84 and 170 square metres internally with terraces with each unit measuring between 8 
and 151 square metres. A pre-approved mortgage scheme of up to 85 per cent loan-to-value ratio is in place with a 
five-year, interest-only option.
Construction has begun on site and is scheduled for completion by the end of 2009.About 180 reservations have 
already been taken in the scheme. On-site amenities including a cafe bar, restaurant and bakery will feature in the 
upper part of the village development, which will be the focal point of the entire scheme. Swimming pools, children's 
play areas and attractive water cascades also feature within the development.
Gabrielle O'Malley, managing director of Splash International, said this relatively undiscovered eastern side of 
Portugal's Algarve was rapidly becoming a popular new destination for investors.
''They see the area as an emerging market where there are still bargains to be had at lower prices than in the more 
established areas. The property prices are still very keen compared to the rest of the Algarve, yet it's the same 
country, same people, and same sunshine and beaches," she said.
Splash International will launch the final phase of O Pomar at the Westbury Hotel in Dublin on next Friday and 
Saturday, May 16 and 17. Further details are available from 01-6764572.

Aer Lingus is to make a second attempt at winning shareholder backing for a move vetoed by Ryanair, its biggest 
single shareholder, last year.
The former state-owned airline, in which Ryanair has a 29 per cent stake, will ask shareholders at next month's 
agm to approve a motion that will allow the company to bypass existing shareholders if it seeks to issue fresh 
shares.
Aer Lingus management failed in its attempt to approve the initiative at last year's shareholder meeting as Ryanair 
voted against the motion. Although 68 per cent of voting shareholders voted in favour, the motion failed as it was 
classed as a special resolution and required the support of 75 per cent of shareholders.
Dermot Mannion, chief executive of Aer Lingus, said, after last year's agm, that the failed proposal was technical in 
nature and would not affect the airline's day-to-day operations.
A Ryanair spokeswoman declined to comment on the airline's voting intentions at this year's agm. Last month, 
however, it voted against a motion put to an agm that was needed by the board to authorise the purchase of new 
aircraft.
That motion was carried against Ryanair's wishes, as it only needed a simple majority of shareholders to vote in 
favour. Ryanair said at the time that the result demonstrated that it had no control over Aer Lingus.

Banking shares on the Dublin market sent the ISEQ index sharply lower as US insurer AIG saw profits slide and as 
oil prices surged again.
The index closed 51.28 points lower at 6,431.38.
The Irish market mirrored European bourses in registering a steep fall as confidence in finance and banking related 
stocks declined after a brief rally. The ECB's failure to budge on interest rates disappointed some who had been 
hoping for at least a sign that base rates might ease, at least in the near term.
 Europe's leading exchanges ended with losses Friday, as the price of oil hit a new all-time high above USD126 a 
barrel and following unsettling announcements from US giants AIG and Citigroup. The DJ STOXX 50 closed 47.30 
points or 1.44pc lower at 3,228.33, and around 2pc lower over the week, while the DJ STOXX 600 fell 4.42 points 
or 1.34pc to 324.86. The index lost some 1.3pc over the past seven days. On the other side of the Atlantic, the DJIA 
was down 109.50 points. Oil prices once again shot up to fresh record highs on the world market with little sign of a 
respite after OPEC insisted the market was well-supplied and driven by speculators. US crude moved a new high of 
USD126.20 a barrel in New York with one top analyst predicting the price could approach USD200 by the end of 
this year. In corporate news in Dublin, drinks group, C and C, was a focus of attention after it delivered operating 
profits of E125.2m for the year to the end of February, a drop of 37pc on the previous year. The company has been 
suffering from a slump in sales of its Magners cider brand in the UK. Overall revenue for the year fell 8pc to E679m 
as cider sales volumes dropped by 11pc. Magners volumes fell 15pc, while its Irish brand Bulmers saw a 4pc fall. C 
and C, said it hopes to achieve "mid single-digit" revenue growth this year. Chief executive Maurice Pratt told 
reporters on a conference call that he expects the premium cider category to return to growth during 2008 after last 
year's poor summer weather hit sales. 'People generally will anticipate that modest growth is probably mid-single 
digit,' Mr Pratt said. Shares in the group dropped by 9c to E4.64. Banks were also major fallers with AIB down 39c

to E13.66, Bank of Ireland fell by 24c to E9.06, Anglo Irish declined by 7c to E9.63 and Irish life and Permanent 
slumped by 22c to E11.12. Shares in Ryanair tumbled by 14c to E2.86 as oil prices surged. Nevertheless, Davy 
Research is forecasting 3.6pc unit revenue growth in 2009 off flat yields - and that despite jet fuel at USD1,100 per 
metric tonne (if prices of crude stabilise at USD110 per barrel) and 2.2pc unit cost growth, outside of fuel costs. 
"Every E1 per passenger changes the bottom line by E55m; every 1pc change in yield alters earnings per share by 
9pc; every 1pc change in ex-fuel unit costs moves EPS by 5pc; every 50c in ancillaries changes EPS by 10pc," 
according to analyst, Stephen Furlong. Shares in Aer Lingus declined by 7c to E1.80.

Body
Surging oil prices and a sharp slide in Wall Street shares overnight helped send the Dublin market back in to 
negative territory this morning.
By midday, the ISEQ index was down 33.39 points to 6,429.53.
While there was new from the likes of Grafton, Aer Lingus and AIB this morning, global affairs dominated investor 
behaviour.
 World oil prices on the New York exchange held just below the USD124 a barrel mark this morning while Brent 
Crude in London broke through the record USD122 level with little sign of a respite. Investors fear ever-rising 
energy prices because they feed directly in to business costs and inflation. 'The rise in oil prices has been attributed 
to this draw in distillates particularly diesel and heavy fuel oil which are seen to be in short supply globally,' said 
Bank of Ireland analyst, Paul Harris. Listed Irish companies that feel the worst of the high cost of oil include aviation 
and CRH, with cement and aggregates production a heavy user of fuel. At home, Irish CPI inflation eased back 
from 5pc in March to an annual rate of 4.3pc in April. Dublin investors also held off buying ahead of the 
announcement today of rates decision from both the ECB and the Bank of England. In its interim management 
statement, Grafton has reported that group revenues in the first four months of the year have fallen by 8pc to 
E944m. Group profit before tax was significantly down compared to the same period in 2007 as the company 
battles a weakening Irish and UK property and construction sector. Overall sales in Ireland are down 16pc year-on-
year while sales in the UK increased by 10pc in sterling terms in the first four months of the year. Grafton shares 
declined by 8c to E5.33. Elsewhere in the sector, CRH fell by 25c to E23.82 and Kingspan edged down 2c to E7.80. 
Shares in AIB were flat at E14.00 after its 80pc owned Polish bank Bak Zachodni WBK posted a smaller-than-
expected 7pc fall in earnings. The Polish bank has reported first-quarter profits attributable to shareholders of 
243.1m zlotys (USD109.7m) compared to an expected figure of 234m zlotys. Bank of Ireland shares gained 4c to

massive rises in crude feeding through to jet fuel. Aer Lingus this week was forced to make its seventh fuel 
surcharge announcement since the price of oil started to climb steeply in late 2006.

In a busy day for corporate announcements, the Dublin market jumped back in to positive territory led by Anglo 
Irish.
The index closed up 72.83 points at 6,462.92.
Two of the index's biggest firms, CRH and Anglo Irish, put out trading statements today with Anglo the day's star 
performer with its shares up 6.5pc or 60c to E9.80 as investors cheered the bank's resilience in the face of the 
credit crunch an property market slowdowns in Ireland and the UK.
 The bank reported a 17pc increase in underlying pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of March, and said it 
continued to expect that growth for the full year would be 15pc. Pre-tax profits rose to E647m for the six month 
period. Davy noted that the strong number came despite the bank absorbing asset valuation hits of a much greater 
than expected E191m. However, analyst, Emer Lang noted that one striking feature of the statement was its 
success in driving down costs. Elsewhere among the banks, AIB was up 14c to E14.00, Bank of Ireland gained 13c 
to E9.13 and Irish Life and Permanent climbed 9c to E10.99. Davy noted that the run of poor economic data for 
Ireland over the past two months or so is unlikely to get any better soon. This week was the turn of the PMI services 
index to hit its lowest point since the middle of the 2001/2002 downturn. That followed a record low for construction 
confidence and a multi-year low for consumer confidence last week. 'The full brunt of the slide in housing 
investment is now being felt,' according to Davy's Rossa White. Investment activity in the recently booming Irish 
commercial property market was down 42pc in the first quarter compared to the same period last year to E52.5m 
from E90.8m, according to Jones Lang LaSalle's Investment market review. At the end of the quarter, a further 
E110m of deals were at the "sale agreed" stage or under offer and E600m worth of property was still on the market 
of either "poor quality and/or overpriced" reflecting the general economic slowdown, according to Goodbody's 
Marina Houghton. Shares in CRH declined by 20c to E23.81. Elsewhere in the sector, Grafton dropped 12c to

E5.34 and Kingspan was down 10c to E7.62. Shares in Ryanair fell by 8c to E2.90 after world crude oil prices broke

this year. Meanwhile, Ryanair's main European rival, EasyJet, posted first-half losses that trebled to £57.5m 
sterling, but passenger numbers were up and summer bookings were ahead of last year. Shares in Aer Lingus 
edged up 1c to E1.93. Shares in financial services group, IFG, edged up 2c to E2.22. Rathbone Bros, a UK peer of 
IFG's, has released an interim management statement for the quarter to the end of March. It has grown operating 
profit by 4pc compared to the previous year to £38.7m, boding well for the Irish group, according to Goodbody's 
Anna Lalor.

In a busy day for corporate announcements, the Dublin market edged back in to positive territory this morning after 
yesterday's slump but building stocks continued to show weakness.
By midday, the ISEQ was up 18.62 points to 6,408.71.
Two of the index's biggest firms, CRH and Anglo Irish, put out trading statements today.
 In an update ahead of its AGM in Dublin today, CRH warned that its goal of achieving its 16th straight year of profit 
and earnings growth is proving 'more challenging' this time round. CRH warned that profits in the first four months 
of the year were behind the same period last year. Its previous target of profit growth for the full year is now "more 
challenging". Davy Research had forecast 4pc growth in operating profit in the first half and 1.7pc for the full year. 
'These forecasts now appear optimistic,' according to analyst, Barry Dixon. CRH blamed the weakness on the 
continuing weakness of the dollar and weaker trends in a number of its markets - including Ireland, Spain and the 
US. Shares in CRH declined by 20c to E23.81. Elsewhere in the sector, Grafton dropped 12c to E5.34 and 
Kingspan was down 10c to E7.62. Anglo Irish was also a focus of attention after it reported a 17pc increase in

Swiss financial companies cast a shadow over European bourses yesterday with gloomy first quarter earnings 
updates from both UBS and Swiss Re.
Sentiment was knocked further by a warning across the Atlantic from Fannie Mae, the largest buyer of US 
mortgages, which predicted significant credit losses stretching into 2009.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 sank 0.5 per cent to 1,351.25 with bad news from the financial sector overshadowing a rally 
in commodities stocks as oil surged to a fresh high.
UBS said it would cut 7 per cent of its workforce and has a preliminary deal with US asset manager Blackrock to 
sell a $15bn porfolio of subprime mortgages. It also reported a sharp slowdown in new money flowing into its 
coffers from wealthy clients. UBS fell 4.5 per cent to SFr35.22 while Credit Suisse  fell 2.6 per cent to SFr56.85 
and Julius Baer sank 3.2 per cent to SFr78.45.
Swiss Re  fell 4.8 per cent to SFr83.45 after its first-quarter net profit halved and it unveiled fresh credit writedowns 
of SFr819m.
Elsewhere in the banking sector Société Générale  fell 2.6 per cent to EUR76.40, Franco-Belgian Dexia  fell 3.4 
per cent to EUR17.7 and Austria's Raiffeisen International slid 2.7 per cent to EUR105.44.
The surging oil price fuelled worries about the impact on companies margins of rising energy costs. Ireland's 
Ryanair fell 5.6 per cent to EUR2.97. The low cost air carrier said that the number of passengers filling seats on its 
flights fell to 79 per cent compared with 83 per cent a year earlier.
In France, oil company Total  rose 0.1 per cent to EUR54.51 and Gaz de France  rose 2.9 per cent to EUR42.97. 
and Portugal's  Galp Energia jumped 3.2 per cent to EUR16.38.
Water group Veolia was the biggest faller on the FTSE Eurofirst 300, dropping 6.3 per cent to EUR43.01 after it 
missed first-quarter profit forecasts.

German sports brand Adidas rose 5.7 per cent to EUR42.7 after it outstripped analysts' estimates with its first-

(ANSA) - Milan, May 7 - Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair expects to transport 14 million passengers in Italy in 2008, the 
company said at a press conference in Milan, in the northern Italian region of Lombardy.
In 2007, Ryanair transported a total 12.7 million passengers and in the period between 1998 and 2007 it serviced 
60 million passengers in Italy.
The Italian market is the second largest for the company, generating a total 12 pct of the passenger traffic of 
Ryaniar.
According to the marketing and sales manager for southern Europe of Ryanair, Alessia Viviani, Ryaniar services 
more foreign passengers from Europe in Italy than any other company.
A total 88 pct of the flights of the company were punctual, Ryanair said. The rate of luggage lost by Ryanair stands 
at 0.6 per 1,000 passengers compared to 17 per 1,000 passengers for Italy's flag carrier Alitalia and 28 per 1,000 
passengers for British Airways.
Ryanair started operating in Italy in May 1998 with the flight connecting Treviso, in northern Italy, to London.

the power of story-telling in helping businesses communicate their message to the wider world.
Yet for Fennell, who now runs his own communications, PR and training company, the two are inextricably linked. 
The Terry Keane Late Late appearance, which he describes as his greatest scoop, was all about the power of the 
story.
The TV producer has now tapped into a growing international corporate phenomenon which began in the US. IBM 
has done it. So too have corporations like Xerox, Nissan and organisations like the World Bank.
They have found a way of using stories from within their organisations to improve internal communications, project 
their own brand and image and in some cases help staff grasp what the corporate entity is all about. ''We are all 
hardwired for stories. There is something in the structure of story that allows people to say, I get it," he said. He 
gives the example of Ryanair. ''It is a walking, living, breathing story," he said.
Ryanair presents itself at all times as the underdog in the David Vs Goliath story, according to Fennell. It presents 
itself as the ruthless pursuer of low cost. For Fennell, the Ryanair example is not just about it image, but people 
who work for the company relate to the story of the company and act accordingly.
''In Ryanair's case that means watching costs. In the case of Virgin, it means doing things in an unconventional 
way. When I go to a company I ask them, what is your story? Who or what are you against? Who are your heroes?"
Some Irish entrepreneurs have fine-tuned their own story so it is part and parcel of their brand and image. Bill 
Cullen, for example, has become the Bill Cullen story.
Telling tales pays off
Fennell describes the power of stories in projecting a company's wider image and cites billionaire entrepreneur 
Sean Quinn's story last year about how he still plays cards with friends in a local pub. ''That says so much about 
him and his company. That makes me say, I'd like to do business with a guy like that," he said.
The invasion of Iraq was presented in a simple way to convince people of its merits, according to Fennell. ''It was 
the story of the weapons of mass destruction and the bad man. An archetypal story and it worked," he said.
Companies are increasingly data driven, but the easy access to information reduces the importance of data and 
people want something more that they can relate to, according to Fennell.
He believes the idea of using narratives and story-telling has wider applications, particularly in large corporations.
Stillwater Communications, which he founded with his sister Antilles (a former head of fund raising for Fianna Fáil), 
advises large companies on how to get the most out of their internal communications. ''We often go into a company 
and ask how are your internal communications, and they'll say its crap, unless its a piece of gossip," he said.
More and more corporations are gathering stories from experienced employees as a way of training newer staff and 
storing up knowledge within the company. For smaller companies, Fennell has found it worthwhile to sit down with 
chief executives and tease out what the story of their company actually is. But is this just a way of creating a 
company spin? ''The story must be true. It is not about spin. It's about exploring with the people behind the 
company what it is and what it stands for," he said.
Typically, Fennell and Stillwater have been called in by existing public relations firms for their clients, but 
increasingly the firm is being approached directly by companies.
For that reason, it has moved to bigger offices and is hiring two more staff. Stillwater is also extending its suite of 
services, which currently include training for interviews, as well as internal communications, PR and preparing 
company executives for media appearances. Existing clients include Bus Eireann, Foras Na Gaelige, Udaras Na 
Gaeltachta and range of private sector interests he would rather not name.
''Business people think that media training will protect them. They see the media as hostile. The truth is the media is 
only hostile if you are not telling the truth. One of the first things they have to learn is that you cannot control what 
the media says about you. So sometimes the best advice to give to a company maybe don't do anything," he said.
Fennell has been in a number of media hotspots over the years which have given him a lot of perspective on how 
things work from the media side of the fence. After producing the Late Late Show he became head of programmes 
with TG4. As a consultant, he was producer on the TV3 Eamon Dunphy Show and with Eddie Hobbs's Rip-off 
Republic.
''With Rip-off Republic we knew we had to have everything right and the best way to ensure that was only to use 
government figures," he said.
For him the power of the Hobbs show was that it was basically written and presented as a series of stories. He 
describes the Terry Keane Late Late Show as his greatest scoop, but the programme they did on the Omagh bomb 
in 1998 as the best show.
The Dunphy Show was ''the biggest adventure," he said, and added that the mistake made was not to move it to a 
Saturday night slot.
He is still a working producer and his latest programme is the two part documentary on RTE called Where's My Job 
Gone. He is also lined up to produce Miriam O'Callaghan's summer show, which kicks off in a few months' time.

Highlight: Carriers attack 'airport monopoly'
Ryanair demands break-up of BAA
Body
The possible break-up of BAA's monopoly over London airports has forced the Civil Aviation Authority to postpone 
making firm proposals for the charging regime at Stansted airport.
Instead, the CAA yesterday referred the issue to the Competition Commission, suggesting only a range of different 
options for setting prices at the airport.
The failure to propose tighter price controls sparked an angry response from Ryanair and EasyJet, the biggest 
operators at Stansted. The two are involved in a deepening conflict with the airports economic regulator - 
particularly over the degree of monopoly power exercised by Stansted.
Andy Harrison, EasyJet chief executive, said it was "abundantly clear from all the evidence that Stansted airport 
enjoys substantial monopoly power and should be regulated accordingly. Stansted needs to be regulated more 
effectively, not let off the leash to exploit the airlines and our passengers," he said.
Ryanair called again for the dismissal of Harry Bush, the CAA group director for economic regulation, and repeated 
its call for the immediate break-up of the BAA monopoly in order to replace this "inadequate" regulation with 
competition.
The CAA called last year for price controls at Stansted to be removed altogether on the grounds that the airport was 
not a monopoly business. However, this was rebuffed by Ruth Kelly, the transport secretary.
The regulator said that Stansted did not have and was not likely to acquire "substantial market power". It 
recommended to the government that price controls be removed and that price-setting be left to commercial 
negotiations between the airport and the airlines led by Ryanair and EasyJet.
Ms Kelly said earlier this year, however, that the authority should continue to set the maximum level of charges at 
Stansted as the "best way of protecting passengers who use the airport".
CAA delays decision on Stansted charges
The CAA said Stansted, one of the three London airports controlled by BAA along with Heathrow and Gatwick, had 
consistently set its charges to airlines below the maximum limits allowed by the price cap during the past five years.
Growth in passenger traffic at Stansted, previously one of the fastest-growing airports in Europe, had slowed greatly 
in the past 15 months, with a rise of only 0.3 per cent last year to 23.8m passengers, it added.
Traffic volumes fell 1.3 per cent in the first three months of 2008 year-on-year, and seat capacity for the summer 
season is down 2.9 per cent.
The airport has also been hit by the recent bankruptcies of Maxjet Airways and Eos Airlines.

EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said France should not fear competition and the European 
Commission's competition policy as they are needed to facilitate growth.
Speaking to the French Senate in Paris, the commissioner said that 'now more than ever, France needs healthy 
competition to modernise its economy, to support its growth and improve the purchase power of its citizens.'
The commissioner said that although France sometimes appears to fear globalisation, it has a large number of 
global players and profits from the opening of its markets and demand from emerging countries.
'To increase growth, France should develop its competitive markets,' Kroes said.
The commissioner said that the liberalisation of energy markets and competition will stimulate growth and 
innovation.
On mergers, Kroes said the commission is not 'dogmatic', as it only blocks less than 1 percent of proposed 
acquisitions.
She said that France in fact benefits from the commission's policy, citing the merger of airlines Air France and KLM.
They are also protected from the creation of dominant companies, as Air France was protected by the commission's 
block of Ryanair Holding PLC.'s proposed takeover of Aer Lingus Group PLC.

A Ryanair plane carrying 170 passengers slipped off the runway at a Lodz airport in Poland amid strong winds on 
Tuesday, forcing the airport to close, said Lodz airport spokesman Milosz Wika.
'A violent wind forced the pilots to place the aircraft at the end of the runway,' Wika said. 'For a reason yet to be 
established, one of the aircraft's wheels left the runway, digging into unstable ground.'
No-one was hurt, but the airport remained closed mid-afternoon with the passengers taken 120 km by bus to

Qantas, the Australian flag carrier, announced drastic measures to boost its revenues, cut costs and conserve cash 
in response to the continuing surge in its fuel costs. Geoff Dixon, Qantas chief executive, said the group was 
suspending its share buy-back programme to conserve cash "in light of the fuel price volatility."
Airlines round the world are being forced by rising fuel prices to take action to bolster their profitability.
In the US, Northwest Airlines said it was raising its fares by 3-5 per cent, in line with increases by other leading US 
carriers including United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Continental Airlines.
"We are making this move to offset the extraordinarily high cost of fuel," said Jim Cron, Northwest senior vice-
president of revenue management.
This month the airline announced emergency measures including increased fees, fares and fuel surcharges; 5 per 
cent domestic capacity reductions; a reduction in the fleet of 15-20 aircraft; and an estimated $100m reduction in 
non-aircraft capital expenditure.
Airlines are seeking new ways of increasing revenues and American said it was introducing a $25 charge for 
second bags checked in on domestic routes.
In Europe, Ryanair said it was raising its fee for checked-in bags from £6 to £8, and that it was raising its charge for 
passengers checking in at the airport rather than online from £3 to £4.
Ryanair has virtually no hedging protection in place for its fuel requirements for the 12 months to March 2009, and 
has warned there is a "significant chance" its profits would fall by as much as 50 per cent this year.
Geoff Dixon, Qantas chief executive, said the group was raising its domestic fares by 3.5 per cent and international 
fares sold in Australia by 3 per cent.
He said Qantas had hedged 34 per cent of its fuel requirements for the 12 months to June 2009 at an equivalent 
crude oil price of $90 a barrel, but the majority of the hedges were in the first half of its financial year. "If high fuel 
Airlines seek to mitigate fuel bill surge
prices persist beyond this point, it would be of increasing concern." But he said the airline was still confident of 
meeting its target of increasing pre-tax profits by at least 40 per cent in the current year to June 2008.

is 36 points up at 6,127 while over in the US, Wall St rallied as credit cpreads continued to tighten which has led to 
the improvement for stocks.
 US earnings season, although littered by losses, has not been quite the debacle that was feared. But central bank 
action to stem fears of further bank failure has been the primary driver. Markets expect the US Fed to cut rates to 
2pc and no further due to inflation fears. "If equities bounce, it will suggest that a majority of investors buy into the

Ryanair has led the charge of airlines complaining to the European Union about Alitalia's EUR 300 million 
emergency loan from the Italian government.
Air France said ''arrivederci'' to its Alitalia takeover bid last week, after months of painful negotiations with unions, 
prompting the approval of a rescue package that has angered rival carriers.
Ryanair queried the legality of the loan to the debt-ridden company.' 'Propping up an inefficient national airline, 
which would have gone bankrupt long ago, is simply illegal," a spokesman said.
An EasyJet spokesman claimed: ''Alitalia has received more bailouts than a sinking ship." British Airways confirmed 
it would also be watching to ensure EU guidelines on state aid were strictly followed.
The recent election of prime minister Silvio Berlusconi was thought to have been the final nail in the coffin for the Air 
France-KLM group deal.
Throughout the election campaign, Berlusconi repeatedly dismissed the offer as ''arrogant'' and insisted Alitalia 
must remain in Italian hands.
Now, he says, the EUR 300 million subsidy will save Alitalia from bankruptcy and lead to a new offer from an all-
Italian consortium, suggesting the move would buy time for potential domestic investors to prepare bids.
The financial lifeline for Alitalia was reluctantly approved by outgoing premier Romano Prodi, who complained of 
unacceptable interference in the attempted sale during the election campaign. He confirmed the loan was larger 
than anticipated, at the specific request of Berlusconi.
The European Commission has already expressed doubts about the measures taken by the Italian government and 
is looking for clarification on the nature of the loan.
Alitalia 's state bailout causes anger in airline industry
Alitalia obtained permission to receive state aid in 2001, on condition that it could not ask for more until 2011. The 
government, which owns 49.9 per cent of Alitalia, will have to prove it acted like a private investor, intervening on 
solely commercial grounds.

Ireland 's Aer Lingus faces industrial unrest after ground staff reject cost-cutting plan
Ireland's Aer Lingus faces industrial unrest after ground staff reject cost-

Aer Lingus faced a renewed threat of disruption Friday after the airline's 1,800 ground staff rejected a painstakingly 
negotiated cost-cutting plan.
Aer Lingus had previously vowed to begin imposing the new work-practices regime and to suspend any worker who 
refused to observe the changes even if union members did not accept the reform package. The directors of Aer 
Lingus declined to comment Friday.
The deal, which was struck between Aer Lingus chiefs and union leaders in February, capped more than a year of 
negotiations and strike threats. It would require workers to accept much more flexible working hours and conditions 
and reduce overtime costs, delivering estimated annual savings exceeding €10 million ($15US million).
Leaders of Ireland's major union the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union known as SIPTU 
expressed disappointment at their own members' rejection of the deal. They had already had members vote again 
after an initial rejection earlier this month.
"While SIPTU regrets the rejection of these proposals, which were recommended for acceptance by shop stewards, 
it is clear that members view them as a step too far," said the union's national industrial secretary, Gerry 
McCormack.
The airline's pilots and cabin crew have accepted their own €10 million ($15US million) cost-cutting package.
Aer Lingus has reported modest profits ever since the government privatized the airline in September 2006. It has 
greatly expanded its U.S. network over the past year and has struck partnerships with two American carriers, 
United Airlines and budget carrier JetBlue.
But Aer Lingus faces ruthless competition on its European network from its Dublin-based rival, no-frills leader 
Ryanair, which tried to swallow up Aer Lingus in a failed hostile takeover last year.
Ireland 's Aer Lingus faces industrial unrest after ground staff reject cost-cutting plan
Chief Executive Dermot Mannion argues that Aer Lingus must become much leaner to hold off Ryanair, which 
continues to hold nearly 30 percent of Aer Lingus' shares.
Unions are pressing for higher wages to keep pace with Ireland's high cost of living. Inflation is currently running at 
5 percent.
Aer Lingus shares closed 2.2 percent higher Friday at €1.90 ($2US.97) on the Irish Stock Exchange, before the 
result of the SIPTU union ballot was known. The share price stands at 14 percent below its flotation price.

The European Commission said it has not yet formally received notification of low-fares airline Ryanair Holdings 
Plc.'s complaint against further financing from the Italian government for flag carrier Alitalia SpA.
A spokesman for EU transport commissioner Jacques Barrot said: 'We take note of the intentions stressed by the 
company...to file a complaint. For the moment, we haven't formally received it.'
The spokesman reminded that the EU executive has asked the government for more information on the financing, 
after saying that 'doubts' had been raised about its nature.
The spokesman declined further comment on the process. The Italian government last came to the rescue of the 
carrier in 2001. Under EU rules, Alitalia is not allowed state aid again until 2011.
Yesterday, Ryanair called on the commission to stop Alitalia receiving a further 300 million euros as a state loan 
from the government.
Ryanair claims Alitalia has already received over 5 billion euros in state aid, which the Irish airline alleges is 
'unlawful'. The Irish budget airline says that without such financial assistance the Italian flag carrier would have 
gone bankrupt years ago.
Earlier on Friday, Italy's incoming prime minister Silvio Berlusconi criticised the commission for questioning a move 
by the state to bail out the carrier with a loan.
'They are making things difficult,' Berlusconi said at a public meeting, the domestic news agency ANSA reported. 
'But I'm not worried by this question, the European Union should help just causes and not create difficulties.'

Soaring fuel costs limit prospects for ultra-cheap carriers
Soaring fuel costs limit prospects for ultra-cheap carriers

As rising fuel prices propel air fares toward the stratosphere, most travelers would like nothing better than to see a 
new low-cost carrier with rock-bottom ticket prices.
Better reserve that idea for sometime in the future.
While past recessions have spawned ultra-cheap airlines, experts say the triple-digit oil prices that are pushing air 
travel out of reach for average Americans also will almost certainly keep a no-frills carrier from entering the market 
any time soon.
"When the economy is bad, it's often a good time for startups because (out-of-work) pilots want to work, planes can 
be acquired for very little and people are wanting to pinch pennies," said Alan Bender, professor of airline 
economics at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Fla. "But with fuel prices being what they 
are, I believe that kills the whole notion."
Soaring oil and jet-fuel prices already have contributed to the shutdown of one true no-frills carrier this spring 
Skybus Airlines, known for its $10 gimmick fares along with forcing ATA Airlines and Aloha Airlines out of business 
and sending Frontier Airlines into a bankruptcy restructuring. Also, Champion Air plans to cease operations and 
MAXjet Airways did so in December.
The price of jet fuel, now about $3.66 a gallon, rises correspondingly with every increase in oil prices. The current 
price is about 66 percent above last year's average price, according to AirlineForecasts LLC. Oil is hovering at 
around $119 a barrel.
"The question is, how would a new low-cost carrier make money?" said Ilker Baybars, a professor and deputy dean 
of Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business. Even at current fare levels, he said, "the economics of 
the airline industry don't make sense."
It's not as if there can't be a successful U.S. version of Ryanair the Ireland-based budget airline that keeps fares 
down by charging extra for everything from water to baggage.
Soaring fuel costs limit prospects for ultra-cheap carriers
People Express, a no-frills carrier that operated from 1981-87, became one of the fastest-growing airlines ever after 
its launch during a bleak economic period. The Newark, N.J.-based airline embraced the "flying bus" concept with 
all economy-class seats, additional costs for checked luggage and snacks, and ticket prices far below the 
competition's.
Similarly, Spirit Airlines was born in the recession year of 1980 as Charter One and prospered under its new name 
and expanded commercial service beginning in 1992, with the economy still in the wake of another down cycle.
But fuel comprises about 50 percent of a startup's operating costs, according to Bender, and at today's prices a new 
carrier would be more vulnerable than ever to a fare war waged by much deeper-pocketed rivals.
Venture capital firms that typically would fund the launch of new carriers have been quiet. Besides high fuel prices, 
they face a tight credit environment where banks are unwilling to take risks.
Existing discount carriers like Southwest Airlines, Jet Blue and year-old Virgin America, while selling tickets at well 
above the level of Skybus-type operators, will still try to undercut legacy network airlines' prices to lure fare-
sensitive consumers. The opportunities to do so are increasing their bigger competitors have raised fares on many 
routes eight times this year, and United is trying to do so again this week.
But those airlines, too, look to be getting more expensive. Southwest has raised fares twice this month, and Jet 
Blue lost money in the first quarter and is joining other airlines in charging passengers for second bags.
Airline consultant Stuart Klaskin says there's no doubt people would flock to a startup offering low fares, but 
likewise questions whether such a carrier could cover its costs.
The unlikelihood of that happening now is fine by him and most of the industry he says ultra low-cost carriers lead 
to irrational price wars that hurt the companies involved.
"The public does not care about the health of the airline industry," said Klaskin, a partner at KKC Aviation 
Consulting in Miami. "The public cares about value for their transportation dollar. There's a reason that Wal-Mart is 
the world's largest retailer, and a reason that Southwest is one of the world's largest airlines."

Irish investors chose to ignore weakening Irish retail sales and opted to look to cheerier news from the US where 
bank earnings added to optimism.
By midday, the ISEQ index was up 113.24 points to 6,205.11.
Wall Street shares closed higher yesterday as gains in the troubled banking sector suggested the market was 
betting the US economy would weather the slowing economy and financial crisis well. The market managed to 
shake off a deeply disappointing report on new home sales and cautious guidance from companies such as Apple 
and Motorola with banks the main risers.
 European shares this morning followed suit as Ericsson and Volvo posted strong earnings. Back in Dublin, retail 
sales recorded its first annual fall since January 2004 as the housing slump, high-profile job losses and a 
weakening economy force consumers to rein in spending. The volume of retail sales decreased by 0.1pc in 
February 2008 compared to February 2007, the latest data from the Central Statistics Office shows. Shares on the 
Dublin market, however, proved resilient. Irish banks were buoyed by the news with AIB up 29c to E13.36, Bank of 
Ireland rose by 10c to E8.99, Anglo Irish gained 29c to E8.09 and Irish Life and Permanent climbed by 19c to 
E11.03. Ryanair was in the news this morning. Analysts at brokers, ABN Amro, have slashed their forecast for 
Ryanair shares from E4.70 to E2.80, citing tumbling consumer confidence and spending power as well as spiralling 
aviation costs, especially fuel. ABN downgraded Europe's two largest low-cost airlines, Ryanair and EasyJet, to 
"hold" from "buy" and Citigroup cut its price target on Ryanair, from E4.40 to E3.80, but it maintains a "buy" stance. 
However, shares in Ryanair jumped by 11c to E2.73 as investors chose to take heart from a Reuters report that 
said that investors may be missing a trick, given hidden value in a growing fleet that could make it a tempting bid 
target for anybody who can raise the funds. Elsewhere, Davy lowered its forecast for house builder, Abbey, to 
reflect the weakness in sterling relative to the euro, increasingly challenging trading conditions and the full impact of 
ISEQ jumps 113 points as banks gain
the recently completed share buyback. "We have lowered our EPS forecast from 96.6c to 93c, implying a 22pc 
year-on-year fall in earnings (H1 EPS fell 14pc year-on-year)," said analyst, Flor O'Donoghue. Abbey shares 
plunged by 14c to E5.14 while CRH shares jumped 56c to E23.80, Grafton gained by 1c to E5.21 and Kingspan 
edged up 1c to E7.55.

An emergency Euros 300m (Dollars 470m, Pounds 240m) Italian government loan to the loss-making airline Alitalia 
is to be investigated by the European Commission, which could order it to be repaid.
Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier, said yesterday it would file a complaint about the deal, which would trigger a 
commission probe. Any state aid must be vetted and approved by Brussels.
A spokesman for Jacques Barrot, transport commissioner, said: "We have doubts on the nature of the measure and 
we want to understand if this is a commercial operation as the Italian authorities claim."
Rome maintains the money is being lent at commercial rates and is vital to keep Alitalia from bankruptcy after Air 
France-KLM pulled out of talks to take it over this week following union opposition. "State aid or no state aid - that is 
the question," the spokesman said. "If state aid, then it should not be paid out before it is authorised."
In practice, there is little Brussels can do to stop the money being handed over. If it rules that it is state aid and must 
be repaid, it can resort to the European court but this can take years.
Still, it marks an early snub to Brussels from Silvio Berlusconi, incoming Italian premier, who pressed the outgoing 
government to lend the money while he casts around for Italian investors to buy the government's 49 per cent 
stake.
Brussels has waved through emergency aid before. Rome guaranteed a Euros 400m loan in July 2004 which was 
repaid within six months at commercial rates. The commission says Alitalia cannot receive any more state aid until 
2011. Mr Berlusconi said a coalition of Italian businesses would bid for Alitalia after looking over its books.
Paris Anestis, a state aid lawyer at Howrey in Brussels, said Rome's best defence was to argue that a private 
owner would do exactly the same. "They will argue they have to keep it going until privatisation to maintain the 
value of their asset. Liquidation is not an option with an airline."

Analysts at brokers, ABN Amro, have slashed their forecast for Ryanair shares from E4.70 to E2.80, citing tumbling 
consumer confidence and spending power as well as spiralling aviation costs, especially fuel.
ABN downgraded Europe's two largest low-cost airlines, Ryanair and EasyJet, to "hold" from "buy".
"We are not surprised that many investors would not want to touch airlines with a bargepole," the broker told clients.
 It added it wouldn't be time to start buying into the sector again until the revenue outlook weakens. However, ABN 
Amro recommended investors to take a closer look at the financially strong companies with good strategic 
positions, because they should be better placed to survive the downturn in the aviation sector. In this group it 
included Ryanair, EasyJet and the three European majors, British Airways , Air France-KLM and Deutsche 
Lufthansa. Citigroup also cut its price target on Ryanair, from E4.40 to E3.80, but it maintains a "buy" stance.

Turnover at the Irish Aviation Authority rose by 14.8pc to E154.2m last year, its annual report shows.
The commercial semi-state body reported after-tax profits that were up from E13.7m in 2006 to E14.7m last year.
The IAA is responsible for the provision of air traffic control services in Irish-controlled airspace and the safety 
regulation of the Irish civil aviation industry.
 Its revenue primarily comes from charging aircraft that use Irish airspace. The majority of these aircraft do not land 
at Irish airports, but instead transit through Irish airspace between Europe and North America. Terminal commercial 
traffic (i.e. commercial aircraft landing or departing the three State airports) rose by 6.6 per cent to 267,828 
movements. Dublin increased by 8 per cent on 2006 to 196,058 aircraft movements; Shannon increased marginally 
(less than 1 per cent) to 35,630 movements while Cork increased by 5 per cent to 36,140 movements. En route 
traffic rose by 5.5 per cent over 2006 figures to 310,831 movements. (The majority of these are aircraft which over-
fly Irish-controlled airspace en route between Europe and North America and do not touch down at Irish airports.) 
North Atlantic airspace communications traffic rose by 6 per cent to 414,645 flights. (The IAA radio station at 
Ballygirreen, Co. Clare provides the vital radio link between air traffic controllers and pilots on the Eastern half of the 
North Atlantic.) The Irish aircraft register continued to grow with a total of 1,132 aircraft on the Irish register at 31 
December 2007, up from 981 in 2006. In particular, heavy commercial aircraft rose from 409 in 2006 to 475 in 2007. 
The number of Irish aircraft on overseas 'dry leases' or in storage was 210 at year-end. Helicopter numbers have 
shown significant growth in recent years with 162 on the register at end December 2007 compared with 56 in 2000. 
Currently, the main carriers are Ryanair (165 aircraft), Aer Lingus (40 aircraft), CityJet (30 aircraft), Aer Arann (14 
aircraft) and Air Contractors (15 aircraft). The IAA provides safety standards surveillance on all Irish air carriers, 
personnel, maintenance organisations and aircraft.

Ryanair has called on the European Commission to block E300m in state aid for Alitalia.
According to Ryanair, without such illegal state aid, Alitalia "which loses almost E1m a day would have gone 
bankrupt years ago".
Speaking today, Ryanair's head of legal and regulatory affairs, Jim Callaghan said:
 "Alitalia's latest E300m bailout makes a mockery of EU State Aid rules. Propping up an inefficient national airline is 
simply illegal. Continued unlawful subsidies are allowing Alitalia to ignore its debts and rack up losses with 
abandon." "The European Commission's repeated failure to enforce its own State Aid rules in the case of Alitalia 
provides more evidence that it applies one set of rules for rule breaking flag carrier airlines but another 
discriminatory set of rules for Ryanair." "We are again today, calling on the Commission to stop ignoring this state

(ANSA) - Rimini, April 24 - Irish low-cost air carrier Ryanair will launch on June 17, 2008 a flight connecting Rimini, 
in the central Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, and London, the company's representative, Giovanna Gentile, 
announced during a news conference in Rimini on April 23, 2008.
The flight will connect three times a week the Rimini's International Airport Federico Fellini and the London Stansted 
Airport, Gentile added.
With the launch of the Rimini-London flight, Ryanair will bring the total number of its flights at the Rimini's airport to 
three, Gentile explained.
Notes
According to an ANSA report from January 15, 2008, Ryanair will start on June 18, 2008 a flight between the

All sides hail review of price control system

Yesterday's announcement by Ruth Kelly, transport secretary, of a government review that should lead to a radical 
overhaul of the airport price control regime was welcomed by all sides - airlines, airports and the regulator.
The challenge will be to put in place a system that can support investment in new airport capacity, at reasonable 
prices, while ensuring passengers are provided with a quality of services that will end the airport misery of recent 
years.
While consumers want an end to "Heathrow hassle," the airlines ultimately expect the regulatory system to deliver a 
mechanism to hold the airports in check and moderate future increases in airport charges. They were stunned by 
the scale of the price rises recently approved by the Civil Aviation Authority, the economic regulator.
Three airlines - Easyjet, Ryanair and BMI British Midland - and the International Air Transport Association are 
planning applications for a judicial review of the five-year charging regimes recently approved by the CAA for 
Heathrow and Gatwick airports. Ryanair says it intends to challenge charges at Stansted.
BAA, the owner of all three London airports, believes that, on the contrary, the latest price settlement is squeezing 
its returns and fails to offer sufficient incentive to invest.
Harry Bush, CAA director of economic regulation, said recently that the regulatory regime could be improved "by 
placing the interests of consumers unambiguously at the heart of the CAA's duties and by encouraging competition 
between airports and between airlines for their business".
The present system seeks to reflect the often conflicting interests of airlines, airport operators and passengers. But 
in a clear warning to airlines angered by the scale of price increases at Heathrow and Gatwick, Mr Bush said it was 
"clear that regulatory reform is no magic bullet - airport investments and service quality will still need to be paid for".
The Competition Commission has yet to make its mind up on what regulatory reforms are needed but said 
yesterday it was concerned the present system might adversely affect competition.
All sides hail review of price control system
Any changes to the regulatory system would not come into operation for at least six years, Ms Kelly said yesterday, 
in order not to change the price caps just agreed for Heathrow and Gatwick (and next year's settlement for 
Stansted) and to give investors at least some medium-term certainty on the financial outlook.
The airport regime, put in place in 1986, is one of the oldest economic regulatory systems in the UK and Ms Kelly 
accepted there was an "urgent need" to consider how the framework could be updated.
She said the government review would focus on how to provide incentives to improve the passenger experience, 
"encourage appropriate and timely investment in additional airport capacity to help deliver economic growth", and 
address the environmental impact of aviation on airport development.
A panel of experts led by Professor Martin Cave, a regulatory economist and director of the centre for management 
under regulation at Warwick Business School, will be appointed to advise her. The CAA has already made clear 
that it wants the scope of its powers to be brought into line with those of the other independent utility regulators 
including Ofcom, Ofwat and Ofgem in the telecoms, water and electricity sectors.
Currently, as the commission report pointed out yesterday, the CAA has only limited powers to intervene in an 
airport's business, once the price caps have been set for five years.
In addition BAA, unlike other utilities, is not subject to a licence.
Importantly there are no provisions to ring-fence the assets of any airport or for a special administration regime in 
the event that BAA was to get into financial difficulties.

UK antitrust regulator hints at BAA breakup

BAA could be forced to sell one or more of its seven airports in Britain including London's Heathrow, Gatwick and 
Stansted after the antitrust regulator released a critical interim report on Tuesday about the company's near 
monopoly in the sector.
Airlines welcomed the potential breakup of BAA's empire flagged by the Competition Commission report, which 
comes as the airport operator continues to deal with the fallout of the disastrous opening of Heathrow's Terminal 5.
The Competition Commission said that BAA's ownership of all seven airports, rounded out by Glasgow, Edinburgh 
and Aberdeen in Scotland, and Southampton in England, "may not be serving well the interests of either airlines or 
passengers."
The regulator stressed that it had not yet reached any conclusions, but added that BAA's dominance in southeast 
England and central Scotland has limited choice and may have contributed to a shortage in capacity.
The commission will seek more information before publishing its provisional findings in August when, it warned, if 
competition problems are identified, it will "set out its possible remedies ... whether requiring the sale of one or more 
of BAA's airports or otherwise."
The report also expressed concern that the regulatory activity of the Civil Aviation Authority "may adversely affect 
competition," prompting the government to announce a review to look at "the potential shortcomings of the current 
regulatory system." The authority is Britain's specialist aviation regulator.
Several airlines have long been pushing for a breakup of BAA's stranglehold on airports the company handles 
about 90 percent of passenger flights made in southeast England and 63 percent of all flights to and from Britain.
"It seems the Competition Commission have seen the light," said Paul Charles, director of communications at Virgin 
Atlantic Airways.
UK antitrust regulator hints at BAA breakup
"They support the views of every airline and every passenger, that there is no competition at our major airports," 
Charles said. "We now need to see a roadmap laid out for changing their ownership structure and tightening the 
regulation of BAA."
Low-fare airlines Ryanair and bmi joined the call for a breakup of BAA, which is owned by Spain's Grupo Ferrovial 
SA.
"The recent chaos at Heathrow's Terminal 5, the continuing long passport and security queues at Stansted, and the 
47 percent price increases at Gatwick clearly proves that the BAA monopoly over the London airports is bad for 
consumers, bad for passengers and bad for U.K. tourism," said Ryanair spokesman Peter Sherrard.
BAA Chief Executive Colin Matthews, who on Monday announced a new management system concentrating more 
on Heathrow, acknowledged that performance needed to improve.
"We are quite clear, and that's why we restructured the company yesterday, that we must have performance 
improvements," Matthews said. "The opening of T5 was really a bitterly disappointing moment."
BAA and Terminal 5 tenant British Airways PLC had heralded the March 27 opening of the terminal as a new 
chapter for travelers at the chronically congested Heathrow airport. Instead, BA was forced to cancel hundreds of 
flights and track down thousands of lost bags as a high-tech portage system malfunctioned and a myriad of other 
problems beset the new terminal.
The Competition Commission's report is more bad news for Ferrovial, which bought BAA for 10 billion pounds ($16 
billion) in mid-2006.
"We see nothing but further equity value destruction in BAA," said Collins Stewart analyst Andrew Fitchie, who rates 
Ferrovial as a "sell" with a target price of 40 euros ($63.71). The shares closed flat at 48.14 euros ($76.34) on 
Tuesday in Madrid.
"With the CC proposals still in the air, some airlines withholding payment of charge increases, and easyJet 
reportedly close to filing for a judicial review of the CAA's price review, numerous uncertainties overhang the 
business, which will make it difficult to refinance its debt by the July deadline," Fitchie said.

The Dublin market skirted negative territory this morning after last week's rally with banks and CRH keeping the 
index from rising further.
By midday, the ISEQ index was up 11.57 points to 6,259.96.
Last week Irish banks gained an average of just 1.8pc, in a week dominated by domestic mortgage market related 
newsflow - most of it negative - as the global credit crisis begins to take a firmer hold.
 Davy Research noted that this underperformance sees the Irish slip back to tenth spot in the ten best-performing 
bank sectors year-to-date (the Irish are now eighth-worst year-to-date, not far behind the UK in sixth-worst spot). 
"Putting this in perspective, they were third-best year-to-date a little less than a month ago, when we published our 
last Davy on Financials," according to analyst, Emer Lang. Over in the UK, Bank of England Governor, Mervyn King 
said plans to swap government bonds for banks' mortgage-backed assets could well turn out to exceed the £50 
billion initially estimated. The plan, which 'aims at restoring liquidity and confidence in the banking sector', has 'no 
arbitrary limit on it', King told reporters at a briefing after the announcement earlier this morning. Shares in AIB 
slumped by 23c to E13.27, Bank of Ireland was down 2c to E9.15 while Anglo Irish climbed 22c to E8.40 and Irish 
Life and Permanent edged up 2c to E12.06. FBD shares jumped by E1.40 to E33.00. CRH did much to keep a limit 
on gains in the ISEQ with its shares down 53c to E23.75 in morning deals. The building materials giant CRH has 
raised more than E300m to help fund its ongoing acquisitions programme. It has raised the E316m in bonds on the 
UK market, successfully carrying through the fund raising despite the ongoing credit crisis. Goodbody Stockbrokers 
said that, according to a news story from Mergermarkets, CRH is one of six companies that are in the second round 
auction process for the German Building products group Xella, which had sales of E1.3 billion in 2006. The ISEQ's 
two airlines felt the effect of surging oil prices today as crude futures broke through another record high, this time 
above USD117 a barrel. Meanwhile, Jet1 jet fuel on the open market hit a record USD1198 per ton last night. Jet 
ISEQ flat after last week's rally
fuel is now 87pc above its level 12 months ago, Goodbody analyst, Joe Gill noted. Shares in Aer Lingus fell by 3c to 
E2.00 and Ryanair declined by 2c to E2.75. Figures released from the UK Revenue show that in first quarter of this 
year betting duties increased by 15.4pc compared to the same period last year and indicating a continuation in the 
popularity in gambling in Britain, Paddy Power's key market. Shares in the Irish bookie, however, slumped by 42c to 
E22.58.

Many Irish investors are looking to the United States and Britain to make a profit on undervalued equities and weak 
currencies, but there are opportunities closer to home. We asked a number of experts for their views on the value in 
the Irish market at the moment.
''To me, CRH represents the best value on the Iseq," said Sean Kenzie, associate director and head of equities at 
Dublin wealth management company Custom House Capital. ''CRH represents outstanding value as, looking past 
all the macro-economic concerns in Europe and the United States, we believe the actual valuation of the company 
to be an absolute steal at 7.8 times forward earnings, which was what it was in 1990." Kenzie said CRH had proved 
its ability to grow its earnings, even based on a much less diversified geographic mix than it has now.
He also pointed to Ryanair as a good option for investors. ''Ryanair will be a fantastic buy at some point. It is 
suffering under the triple whammy of high oil prices, weak sterling and a British consumer slowdown. However, 
there is no credit in its current share price for future growth nor the competitive advantage it enjoys from its cost 
base. As regards an entry point, I would like to see it hold above its March low of  2.55 and show some upside 
momentum before buying."
While there is good value to be had in the Irish market, Jim Power, chief economist with Friends First, said investors 
would have to wait a while to see the benefit of their investment. ''In relation to the Irish equity market, most 
companies are very cheap relative to past values, but this cheapness is unlikely to be realised any time soon. Food 
and oil appear to be the only real winners at the moment," he said.
''On a risk/reward basis, most Irish stocks do not look very attractive at the moment because, for any market to 
realise its value, buyers are needed. There are very few buyers in the Irish market at the moment, with international 
investors still not interested, and Irish fund managers under increasing pressure to reduce their exposure to the 
Irish market. With few buyers and lots of sellers, the Irish market does not look capable of making any progress just 
yet," Power said.
CRH, Ryanair will come good
He said a strong international recovery would be required to drag the Irish market up in a sustainable manner. ''That 
does not appear likely for the foreseeable future, as the subprime crisis still has quite a distance to go. It is time for 
investors to batten down the hatches."
Liam Igoe, analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers, said there was no shortage of value in the market at the moment.
''If there is a silver lining in the dark clouds over the markets at the moment, it is the ability to buy quality stocks at 
good values."
Igor said food group IAWS represents especially good value at the moment. ''It is worth buying, full stop. It is a good 
company and is growing, even through a difficult market." On the industrial side, Igoe pointed to Grafton, which he 
said was a good company and a good buy, especially at its current share price.

A strong overseas challenge is expected for the main races at the Punchestown National Hunt Festival, where the 
total prize fund is  3 million.
There are 11 grade one races, with a total value of almost  1.7 million. This year's festival will also decide the 
champion trainer, owner and jockey titles when racing finishes on Saturday.
In the owners' championship, JP McManus has a commanding  275,000 lead over Ryanair chief executive Michael 
O'Leary, but, given the level of prize money on offer at the Kildare track, a win for O'Leary in any of the feature 
races could reduce that margin considerably.
O'Leary will be hoping that his Mossbank - the runner-up in the Ryanair Chase at Cheltenham recently - can go one 
better when he contests the Grade 1  275,000 Guinness Gold Cup on Wednesday. Mossbank is the 5/2 second 
favourite behind Neptune Collognes, last year's winner and current 11/8 favourite.
Last time out, he chased home stablemates Denman and Kauto Star in the Cheltenham Gold Cup for British 
champion jumps trainer Paul Nicholls.
Other entries include the Conor Clarkson-owned and Tom Taaffe-trained Kicking King, who won this race in 2005 
and the Aintree Grand National third, and Snowy Morning, trained by Willie Mullins.
Mullins is in a duel of his own with reigning champion trainer Noel Meade, as he looks to become champion trainer 
for the first time since the 2000/2001 season. Meade endured an almost two-month long winnerless run last 
January and February.
Regardless of whether he takes the trainer's title, Mullins should see his son Patrick take the champion qualified 
rider's crown, as he leads Nina Carberry by seven winners going into the final week of the season.
The professional jockey's title looks like going to Ruby Walsh for the fourth time in a row and the sixth time in total.
Three champion titles at stake
Walsh, who divides his time riding for Willie Mullins in Ireland and Paul Nicholls in Britain, had trailed freelance rider 
Davy Russell by 11 winners.
However, an injury to Russell at Fairyhouse on April 8 saw him ruled out of action until yesterday at Cork, leaving 
Walsh to eat into his lead and go four winners ahead.
The Punchestown festival starts on Tuesday, when the feature race is the  200,000 Kerrygold Champion Chase, 
where Walsh is likely to ride Natal for Paul Nicholls. Arthur Moore may run both Mansony and Tiger Cry.
The Jimmy Mangan-trained Conna Castle and Dessie Hughes' Schindlers Hunt, which both won at Fairyhouse over 
Easter, are also entered.
The  200,000 Ladbrokes.com World Series Champion Stayers Hurdle is the feature race on Thursday. Blazing 
Bailey, trained in England by Alan King, is the 5-2 favourite, with the Eoin Griffin-trained Kazal, owned by Jim 
Comerford, next best at 4-1.
Kazal finished ahead of Blazing Bailey when third to Inglis Drever at Cheltenham, but the English challenger has 
since won at Aintree.
King's only other runner at the festival is likely to be JP McManus's Franchoek.
On Friday, the  220,000 ACC Bank Champion Hurdle is the main event and Henry de Bromhead's Sizing Europe, 
who was pulled up injured in the Cheltenham equivalent, is on a recovery mission. Nicky Henderson's Cheltenham 
Champion Hurdle third Punjabi, won at this meeting last year, and the 2007Champion Hurdle winner, Sublimity, are 
also likely to line up.
The final day sees the first running of the  220,000 Ballymore 25th Anniversary Hurdle, the richest handicap hurdle 
in Ireland and Britain. While the owners, trainer and jockeys are chasing the big prizes, punters will also be hoping 
to strike it rich, as the Tote jackpot will be guaranteed for  40,000 every day.

An Irish developer has ambitious plans for sites in Lithuania, writes Diarmaid Condon.
Lithuania was the first Soviet satellite state to declare independence in 1990, with the last Russian troops 
withdrawing in 1993 and the country subsequently integrating into western Europe through its membership of NATO 
and the EU.
Since then the Lithuanian economy has been one of the strongest in the emerging EU states, and property prices 
have grown at a steady pace over the past decade.
Apart from the fact that Ireland has been home to thousands of workers from Lithuania during our prolonged 
economic boom, you would probably assume that the countries don't have all that much in common, but you would 
be wrong. In terms of size and population they are very similar, and on accession to the EU in 2004, Lithuania 
declared its intent to mirror Ireland's recent economic performance.
Until the recent global economic downturn, it was doing a pretty good job.
The strong property market has meant that there has been a steady, if unspectacular, stream of Irish property 
investors attracted to the capital, Vilnius, some of whom are now spreading out to the country's second city, Kaunas 
and it's main port city, Klaipeda.
Improvement in flight access, with Aer Lingus flying to Vilnius and Ryanair operating to Kaunas, has meant that it is 
becoming more familiar territory for investors. It has also attracted a number of Irish developers such as Duke 
House Asset Management, which purchased the former Communist Party headquarters in Vilnius in 2004.
The firm turned the building into a high-end shopping centre with 10,500 square metres of retail space. Another 
consortium, which included financial pundit Eddie Hobbs, also purchased a building on Gedimino Avenue which is 
now home to a designer retail outlet and a number of apartments.
Baltic tiger lures Irish investors in
The average wage across Lithuania is  580 per month, rising to  770 per month in Vilnius. At these rates you would 
not expect to see many designer shops in the city, but in fact there are scores of them along the main street and in 
the upmarket Old Town area.
Here you'll find regular traffic from cash-rich Belarusian shoppers, but also a growing proportion of aspirational 
Lithuanians whose salaries are rising on the back of strong economic growth over the past decade.
The amount of retail space in Lithuania is still well behind that of the other Baltic States and it has therefore 
continued to be active in development. It has generally been possible to successfully pre-lease units and there are 
still low vacancy rates, particularly in Vilnius.
Anchor tenants are usually one of four main grocery chains (Maxima, Rimi, IKI and Norfa), a DIY chain (Senukai) 
and a fashion retailer (Apranga). GDP growth and salary increases, together with growing interest from international 
brands, continue to drive growth across the country.
One Irish investor active in the market is farmer Peter Baker, who decided to diversify out of agriculture in 2004. ''I 
decided that Lithuania and its property industry offered interesting opportunities," he said.
''The country is one of the fastest growing economies in the EU, with GDP growth of 8 per cent in 2007. The 
unemployment rate is under 5 per cent and there is a very low level of personal and mortgage debt due to almost 
full ownership of property, a legacy of the departing Soviet regime."
Baker formed a company called M2 Invest to identify prime development projects where land and building use could 
be changed, and value added by obtaining building permissions and then building out the projects. The company 
has raised capital via syndicates of private investors to facilitate its operation in the Lithuanian market.
The company's most high profile project to date is St Jacob's Monastery, a 1.4 hectare site on the banks of the river 
Neris in Vilnius.
The former hospital is close to Gedimino Avenue and beside Lukiskiu Square, the largest green area in the city. 
The site also has access to the city's new business district via a pedestrian bridge. Directly across the river is the 
proposed location for a new Guggenheim Museum.
M2Invest intends to create a high-end mixed use development on the site which will consist of a 13,000 square 
metre commercial complex plus 5,500 square metres of residential space set around a landscaped courtyard.
There will also be 350 underground parking spaces. A detailed plan will be approved this month with completion 
due for 2010.
The company has other sites across the city at various stages of planning, including one in the heart of the Old 
Town, which is one of the largest in eastern Europe at 360 hectares.
The approximately 1,500 buildings in the Old Town were built over a number of centuries, resulting in a mix of 
architectural styles, and the area is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
HereM2Invest has plans for a development comprising 7,000 square metres of residential and retail space, together 
with a 1,000 square metre cinema and 120 underground parking spaces. Completion is scheduled for mid-2010.
It also has a project in the artists' quarter, which is close to the Old Town with nearby access to the national park. 
On this site, the company intends to develop 5,300 square metres of residential space consisting of town houses. 
Completion is due by the end of next year.
Widening its horizons beyond Vilnius, M2 has also bought a riverside plot overlooking the Old Town in Kaunas.
Here it intends to develop a 75,000 square metre development to include apartments, retail and office space. 
Detailed planning on this project is expected by May.
Baltic tiger lures Irish investors in
With the current banking crisis affecting confidence in markets across the world, there is no doubt that the 
Lithuanian economy has slowed. However, Baker believesM2 is in a good position to weather the storm.
''The fundamentals of the Lithuanian market suggest the current downturn may offer an ideal opportunity to enter 
the market," he said.
''There is still a significant level of interest from successful Irish development companies keen to pursue overseas 
opportunities. Ultimately I sees Lithuania as a perfect springboard to business opportunities in the wider region."

Getting hammered in Porto

The second city of Portugal may be overshadowed by Lisbon and the Algarve as a tourist destination, but it has lots 
to offer, not least its head-tapping, mind-boggling Festa da Jaoa, writes Dick O'Riordan.
The entire population of Porto was getting hammered - men, women and children. Everyone was fair game; babes 
in arms, old geezers in wheelchairs, even the dogs in the streets were not spared.
We had arrived in the north Portuguese city during one of those wacky festivals so popular on the Iberian peninsula. 
The Festa da Jaoa on June 23 is a particularly amusing outbreak of insanity.
And, of course, there's always a saint involved. In this case it was St John, though what a saint has to with people 
being tapped on their heads with a hammer is still a mystery. Our guide, questioned mercilessly on the practice, 
pleaded the Fifth Amendment.
The most plausible explanation is that the harmless squeaking plastic hammer (sold everywhere on the day) 
replaces the leek - the traditional weapon of choice.
These are still for sale in great intimidating bunches outside shops, and look far more dangerous than mere plastic 
hammers. Maybe the festival casualty rate in olden days caused the change-over.
Either way, here was communal mayhem. Slow, heaving masses of people meandered like a sludgy river through 
the steep cobbled streets of the Ribeira, the old medieval fishing quarter of the city, and down to the pounding heart 
of the action - the quayside of the mighty Douro (a name of Celtic origin).
Its narrow parapet filled up alarmingly, as revellers jockeyed for prime position along the river-front for the annual 
highlight of the festival - the midnight fight-to-the-finish fireworks blitz between Porto and its sister city Vila Nova de 
Gaia, on the far bank of the Douro.
Getting hammered in Porto
The air of expectation was palpable, the excitement overlaid with a jungle-like cicada chorus of squeaks from the 
non-stop plastic hammers. We happily escaped to the peace and safety of a river cruiser that was to provide not 
just a perfect view of the fireworks battle, but a nightlong supply of food (including a pig roasting on a spit), drink, 
dancing and revelry unconfined.
The river boat also provided a dramatic view of the city's topography. We had come prepared with an intriguing 
image of a bird's-eye view of Porto that we had read in a magazine: it described it as looking like a ''singularly 
dangerous spider's web flung across space''. Alas, Ryanair does not do views - and would probably charge for them 
if it did - so we have to pass on our own impression for what it is worth.
The Ribeira spreads out in front of you, its chaotic jumble of buildings, some classical, others mundane, heaped 
one on top of the other in no sensible order of size, shape, importance or tonnage. Strangely, this indiscriminate 
crush of buildings creates a kind of Middle Eastern ambiance.
Overall, the old quarter, with its smoky bars and seafood restaurants, is impressively authentic and has a timeless 
quality. I imagine that a Conquistador, just out of his cryonic state, could ramble down to his galleon in breast plate 
and medieval regalia without feeling out of his century. He might be alarmed by the strange red phone boxes - 
souvenirs of Britain's powerful influence right up to the middle of the 20th century.
He might also have wondered about the strange flags now flying, which signify Unesco's protection of the city under 
its world heritage charter. However, a glimpse of the mighty Romanesque Catholic cathedral, which towers over the 
area like a fortress, would help calm his nerves. The 12th century Se Catedral is the most impressive example of 
Porto's great gothic architectural tradition.
Across the river, on the less steep and less dramatic - though still worthy of a visit - Gaia side, is amore powerful 
reminder of England's long influence: the hoardings of the great port wine companies that dominated the region for 
centuries and still play an important role in Portugal's economy.
It was the British who discovered the quality of the wines from the Douro valley, and who discovered that they could 
get it back to England in good shape by adding brandy as a preservative. It worked a treat, and this simple act 
produced dynasties such as Taylor's, Sandeman's and Graham's, names that have become synonymous with the 
wine trade.
They are now also part of another trade, thousands of tourists visiting their caves and wine museums every year, 
gaping and gasping at the size of the massive oak casks and laughing at pictures of bare-footed peasants - 
trousers and skirts hitched above the knees - dancing on the grapes, often to musical accompaniment.
This traditional method of squashing the grapes, now a source of amusement, still survives, and with good reason. 
Unlike industrial pressers, bare feet do not break the grape pip, thus producing a sweeter wine. But, sadly, bare feet 
are becoming harder to hire, as are grape pickers, many of whom now come from eastern Europe and, according to 
some vineyard owners, are not as committed to the industry as the local inhabitants. ''Our traditions are dying," a 
boatman told me.
Porto - citizens much prefer it to Oporto - has a number of claims to fame, aside from being the centre of the port 
wine industry. It is the oldest city in Portugal, has given its name to the country, and has spanned the Douro with six 
mighty bridges, any of which would dwarf Ireland's best effort. Just to cross these dizzying heights, by train, car or 
walking, and look down on the city, is a spectacular experience.
The city's history can be traced back3,000 years. It includes Roman conquest as part of its story - and has the ruins 
to prove it. Football fans might also claim that it is the city that led to the ascension of Jose¤ Mourinho, and to have 
witnessed him actually smiling on a couple of occasions.
'The Special One' - when can we expect his reincarnation? - developed his smouldering persona here, when he 
won the Uefa Cup and the Champions League with the unfashionable FC Porto.
Getting hammered in Porto
The subsequent celebrations, in the ornate Avenida dos Aliados in the centre of the city, are said to have been 
unrivalled since the days when the conquistadors sailed back with their loot.
Whatever about football magic, Porto also had another magical resident in the recent past: JK Rowling, creator of 
Harry Potter, lived there for seven years. On fireworks night, however, there are few cultural consideration. The 
crowds, on land and river, were expecting a spectacle beyond the wildest imagination of Rowling's little wizard.
Porto duly delivered, on this occasion with a difference. For the first time, the fireworks would not be a battle of two 
halves - the opposite sides joined forces to produce just one phenomenal bombardment of dazzling intensity. Even 
the cheers of the crowd were barely audible; this was shock-and-awe entertainment on a Hollywood scale.
For an hour, massive explosions of gold dust spread across the sky and slowly faded away like gentle rain. The 
great iron King Luiz Bridge - built by a pupil of Gustav Eiffel in 1898 - turned into a waterfall of silver. Umbrellas of 
coloured light drifted aimlessly across the heavens, aloof to the lower layers of exploding bedlam.
The noise intensified, sending tremors through the river boats. It was an extraordinary spectacle, unforgettably 
surreal - and then, suddenly, it was all over. The feeling was one of exhilaration, yet relief. Rather than scatter, the 
crowds intensified and the volume was pumped up on the quayside.
This was not the end of the party, just the beginning - the night was yet young. Let's face it, Porto is not a 
destination that has attracted much Irish attention down the years. Its image is that of an unglamorous, industrial 
city, not comparable with Lisbon or the Algarve in tourism appeal. And, in a strange way, its unfashionable image is 
what makes it so interesting.
Outside of its history and culture, it can lure tourists with modern attractions such as a fine popular beach, 
interesting shopping, the azulejos-covered (blue story-telling tiles) central train station - that is a work of art - fine old 
coffee houses and book shops and - a recent addition - the intriguing Casa da Muscia, a revolutionary concert hall, 
which claims one of the best acoustics system in the world (and seats which cut out the need for people to stand up 
when allowing other people past).
Of more than passing interest is the excellent Luas-like trams, which cost a fraction of Dublin's - the subject of a 
recent report in The Sunday Business Post. Also praiseworthy is the Portuguese food, which seems centred on 
seafood and sea creatures of one sort or another. Whatever your liking for octopus or squid, please, I beg you, 
avoid little black jellied legs that look like cloven hooves.
Remember, too, that tripe of one sort or another is on offer everywhere, though, gratefully, it tends to be in jars and 
can't escape. The locals love it so much they acquired the nickname 'tripeiros' from their countrymen.
Ryanair's thrice-weekly service to Porto opens up opportunities for not just discovering a city of medieval and 
baroque splendours, but also for exploring the green and mountainous countryside of the spectacular Douro valley, 
with its hill-clinging vineyards and white-walled red-roofed villages.
Best of all, Porto is just an hour-and-a-half away - our pilot told us this proudly as we landed - though he did 
mention something about a strong tailwind. Maybe Michael O'Leary is now paying bonuses for world aviation speed 
records in his bid to cut fuel costs.

EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said the efficiency of the 27 member state bloc's strategy on state aid 
ensures that a gap in productivity with the United States is closing.
Speaking on wide-ranging issues of competition policy in Paris, Kroes said: 'The gap is now closing, after a decade 
of widening up until 2006.'
'Our state aid framework addresses market failure instead of picking winners. Rather than being rooted in dogma, 
state aid rules are flexible like our merger guidelines'.
'Our vibrant competitive markets are already full of winners, picked by consumers, from level playing field,' she said, 
citing the examples of Suez SA., Vivendi Universal SA. and Vodafone Group.
On merger policy, Kroes said the commission was right to block low cost air carrier Ryanair Holdings' proposed 
acquisition of Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group Plc. 'Stopping that merger protected passengers on more than 14 
million journeys,' she said.
Turning to individual countries, Kroes said Finland was an example of how to create a competitive economy in 
Europe.
'Creating a positive competitive framework for business works - smaller member states such as Finland...(has) 
demonstrated this. The thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises clustered around Nokia in the Helsinki 
region are a direct example.'
'Nokia succeeded because Finland, according to the World Economic Forum's index, has an exceptionally 
competitive business environment. Nokia didn't wait for a government subsidy and the result is Finland has its foot 
on the economic accelerator'.

From Mr Joe Gill.
Sir, Your editorial on airlines, "Low fare, high cost" (April 14), says "economies cannot be made on fuel and 
aircraft". That is true about oil but not about jets. Properly run low-cost airlines have more than 90 per cent of their 
fixed assets in aircraft. The timing of that capital expenditure is crucial to survivability and returns on capital.
Ryanair's 2005 bulk order with Boeing, and EasyJet's earlier deal with Airbus, were timed to exploit weakness 
among the manufacturers. The pricing of those deals ensures both carriers can withstand the unfolding hurricane of 
fuel and economic headwinds (albeit with depressed profits). Conversely, poor timing of aircraft orders lies at the 
root of failing airline models in both Europe and America.

EasyJet and Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost airlines, are threatening to refuse to pay higher charges to BAA, 
the UK airport operator, and are planning to pursue judicial reviews of the price rises.
EasyJet is protesting against the new price regime at Gatwick airport, its biggest UK base, while Ryanair is 
opposing the latest price rises at Stansted.
BAA warned the airlines they were legally obliged to pay charges in full, pending the resolution of any dispute. 
Separately, BMI British Midland is examining whet-her to seek a judicial review of the price increases at Heathrow. 
The airlines are fighting the decision by the Civil Aviation Authority, the regulator, last month to sanction a jump in 
charges per passenger at Heathrow by 86 per cent, from Pounds 10.36 to Pounds 19.31, over the next five years. 
At Gatwick, charges per passenger will rise by 49 per cent, from Pounds 5.61 to Pounds 8.36, including a 21 per 
cent increase this year.
After the CAA's ruling, the airlines launched a fierce attack on the economic regulation of the three London airports. 
Four of the largest airlines operating from the UK - BMI, EasyJet, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic - demanded a 
complete overhaul of the regulatory system and a break-up of BAA's London airports monopoly.
The four carriers said the "dramatic" price rises at Heathrow and Gatwick demonstrated that the system was 
"broken and needs to be changed".
EasyJet said yesterday it had told BAA that it intended to withhold part of the price increase being imposed on it at 
Gatwick, pending the outcome of a judicial review. It is expected to file the application for the judicial review within 
three weeks.
Andy Harrison, EasyJet chief executive, said the airline considered the CAA's decision on airport charges to be 
"unlawful and damaging for the airlines, our passengers and the industry as a whole". EasyJet said it had received 
no reply from BAA after writing four weeks ago to seek its agreement that any decision by the courts that charges 
were too high would see the difference returned to the airline, so that passengers could be refunded.
Rising BAA charges lead to rebellion
In a letter to Colin Matthews, BAA chief executive, Mr Harrison has proposed withholding part of the new Pounds 
6.79 per passenger charge this year at Gatwick, with the amount to be kept in a separate account pending the 
outcome of the legal challenge.
Ryanair said it would withhold payment of the latest increases at Stansted if BAA imposed the maximum allowed 
price rises. Stansted airport warned Ryanair that it would take any action deemed "appropriate" to recover any 
underpayment.
Gatwick airport said it would "continue to charge in accordance with the CAA's decision".

Low-cost airlines easyJet and Ryanair threatened Tuesday to withhold part of the landing charges they pay airport 
owner BAA while they challenge the latest fee increases in court.
EasyJet chief executive Andy Harrison said his airline will hold back paying some of the 21 percent increase in 
charges at London's Gatwick airport until a court reviews fee increases that took effect on April 1.
"We are determined to address a regulatory decision which we consider to be unlawful and damaging for the 
airlines, our passengers and the industry as a whole," Harrison wrote in a letter to BAA.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said his airline will also challenge BAA's plans to increase fees by 7 
percent at Stansted airport, northeast of the capital.
The fee is charged for each departure or arrival at the airports.
Both carriers said they will hand over the withheld money if their legal challenges fail. In the meantime, they will 
charge passengers and hold the money in special accounts.
Fees vary between airports and the new increases meet guidelines set by Britain's Civil Aviation Authority, BAA's 
Stansted spokesman Mark Davison said.
He said London's airports raise their landing fees at different times, often over a five-year period. The CAA allowed 
fees to rise 23.5 percent per passenger at Heathrow on April 1.
British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, bmi, easyJet and Ryanair all criticized that increase, saying the regulatory system 
has failed.
They also have called for an end to BAA's monopoly of London's airports.

ROUNDUP Easyjet , Ryanair to challenge BAA price rises as airport profits lift

Two no-frills airlines announced plans to challenge BAA over higher charges at Gatwick and Stansted airports on 
Tuesday as figures from the airport operator reportedly showed its profits from Heathrow rose by 10 percent last 
year.
Easyjet Plc. said it had informed the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of its intention to seek a judicial review of a 
21 percent increase in charges imposed at Gatwick from April 1.
Irish rival Ryanair Holdings also said it would seek a review if BAA goes ahead with a proposed seven percent 
increase in passenger charges at Stansted.
Both airlines said they were planning to withhold part or all of the increases until the outcome of the reviews are 
known.
Easyjet and Ryanair announced their intentions as the Times reported Tuesday that the holding company used by 
Spain's Grupo Ferrovial SA and two other investors to buy BAA, Airport Development & Investment Ltd (ADIL), 
made 438 million pounds from Heathrow last year, up 40 million from the previous year.
Profits at Stansted rose 68 percent to 86 million pounds after the operator doubled its charge for each passenger 
using the airport, the newspaper reported, quoting figures from ADIL's accounts.
Airlines, politicians and watchdogs have criticised BAA for under-staffing and poor service at Heathrow and its other 
London airports. The company is currently grappling with baggage system problems that ruined the launch of 
Heathrow's flagship Terminal 5.
It is also waiting to hear the outcome of a Competition Commission investigation, which may recommend the sale of 
one or more of the group's airports.
BAA said in a statement that its charges are set by the CAA, which it said determines 'a reasonable rate of return 
for the company to make at its regulated airports'.
'We are investing heavily to improve air passengers' experience and have recently recruited an additional 2,200 
security officers,' the statement said.
ROUNDUP Easyjet , Ryanair to challenge BAA price rises as airport profits lift
'We are also investing 5.8 billion pounds over the next five years to improve facilities at our airports.'
The CAA said last month it would allow BAA to increase charges at Heathrow by 23.5 percent in real terms from the 
current 2007/08 price cap, with allowed charges subsequently increasing in each of the following four years by no 
more than retail price index (RPI) inflation plus 7.5 per cent each year. At Gatwick, charges will rise this year by 21 
percent with allowed charges subsequently increasing in each of the following four years by no more than RPI 
inflation plus two percent.
The CAA said its decision would allow BAA to invest in facilities and to improve its service. The airport operator 
claimed the increases were inadequate and airlines condemned them as excessive.
Easyjet's chief executive Andy Harrison said in a letter to BAA's new chief executive Colin Matthews that it 'objects 
strongly' to last month's decision.
'We are determined to address what we consider to be a regulatory decision that we consider to be unlawful and 
damaging for the airlines, our passengers and the industry as a whole,' Harrison said.
Easyjet said it plans to withhold part of the 6.97 pounds charge at Gatwick until it knows the outcome of the review.
If its challenge fails, the airline will hand over the money withheld to BAA along with any interest accrued, Harrison 
said.
If it succeeds and a lower charge is then set, Easyjet will implement a mechanism to return what it had saved to 
passengers, he said.
Ryanair said the proposed increase at Stansted comes on top of a 100 percent increase in passenger charges 
imposed in April 2007.
The Dublin-based airline said that if BAA imposes the increase -- the maximum allowed by the CAA -- it will launch 
judicial review proceedings and will withhold the latest increases, in an escrow account, until the outcome of the 
proceedings.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said: 'These latest unjustified price hikes by the BAA airport monopoly prove that it 
is abusing its monopoly power over passengers and airlines at Stansted.'
The High Court could make a decision on the case by the end of the year if it approves EasyJet's application for a 
hearing, the Sunday Times reported last month.

Over 60pc of those who can go online at work have restrictions on which sites they can visit including social 
networking sites, entertainment sites, webmail and online shopping sites, a survey on internet usage from Eircom 
found today.
It found that nearly two thirds of all working adults have Internet access at work.
The survey found that 78pc of all workers use the Internet for personal use at work. 18 to 34 year olds spend the 
longest time on the Internet at work, clocking up over an hour a day including 36 minutes during their lunch break 
and 27 minutes throughout their working day. 35 to 44 year olds spend over 40 minutes a day (27 minutes during 
their lunch break and 15 minutes throughout their working day). Workers aged over 45 also spend over 40 minutes 
a day (21 minutes on their lunch break and 22 minutes through their working day).
 Overall men spend longer surfing the Internet during their working day with women surfing more during their lunch 
break or after work. The research conducted by Red C on behalf of eircom concluded that 47pc of workers who 
have Internet access at work are blocked from social networking sites such as Bebo, MySpace and Facebook. 43pc 
cannot access YouTube and other entertainment sites. 32pc have no access to webmail and 26pc cannot shop 
online on portals such as Amazon, eBay or Ryanair. According to another recent industry report, these sites are 
also the most popular websites for 22 to 29 year olds. Over half of workers feel their Internet usage is monitored at 
work. Most felt they were monitored by software programmes (37pc), followed by the boss (27pc) and finally work 
colleagues (13pc).

Budget airline Ryanair Holdings said it has written to BAA, owned by Spain's Grupo Ferrovial SA, objecting to a 
proposed 7 percent increase in passenger charges at Stansted, adding that it will launch a judicial review of the 
increase if it does not receive a reply.
The proposed increase comes on top of a 100 percent increase in passenger charges imposed in April 2007, the 
airline said.
Ryanair said that if BAA does impose the increase, which would be the maximum allowed by the Civil Aviation 
Authority, it will launch judicial review proceedings and will withhold the latest increases, in an escrow account, until 
the outcome of the proceedings.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: 'These latest unjustified price hikes by the BAA airport monopoly 
prove that it is abusing its monopoly power over passengers and airlines at Stansted.'
Ryanair's move follows an announcement by easyJet Plc. earlier today that it had informed the CAA of its intention 
to challenge the price rises imposed by BAA at Gatwick through a judicial review.
EasyJet also said it plans to withhold part of the increase at Gatwick until it knows the outcome of the review.

"The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires significant capital to engender the growth, and then 
earns little or no money. Think airlines." Last week half a dozen carriers demonstrated the truth of Warren Buffett's 
words by going bust - and showed in the process that neither "all-business class" nor "low cost, long haul" operating 
models are immune to the airline industry's deadly economics.
Oasis Hong Kong, which offered cheap fares to London and Vancouver, collapsed, as did a cluster of US airlines, 
from Skybus, a start-up low-cost, short-haul carrier, to Frontier Airlines, a discount carrier that flies out of Denver. 
Silverjet, an all-business class airline in the UK may be taken over, following the demise of rival Maxjet last 
December.
The machines that airlines fly are extravagantly expensive, the fuel that they fly on can lurch in price at any time, 
and the complex networks that they manage fall apart at the least disruption. Customer demand is cyclical and 
depends on the strength of the economy. There are minimal barriers to entry. It should be no surprise that airlines 
struggle to make money.
Low-cost short-haul carriers - exemplified by JetBlue in the US, Ryanair in Europe, and AirAsia flying out of Kuala 
Lumpur - are a partial exception. They start without the bad labour relations, complicated sales channels and legacy 
costs of traditional airlines.
The limits of this model, however, are becoming clear. No matter how low other costs are driven, economies cannot 
be made on fuel and aircraft, which become even more important as a percentage of total expenses. While no-frills 
may work for short-haul, nobody has shown that long-haul passengers can cope without meals and movies. Too 
many start-up airlines, meanwhile, are low-fare, but not really low-cost.
All-business class is a brave attempt to tempt high-value passengers with lower fares and more exclusive service. 
But traditional airlines have powerful advantages in this market - corporate contracts, a wide range of destinations, 
frequent-flyer programmes - that new competitors will need to invest a lot of capital to overcome.
With oil at Dollars 110 a barrel, US consumers nervous and financing costs also on the rise, it is an unpleasant time 
to own an airline. Yet somehow the romance of aviation persuades entrepreneurs to keep on launching airlines and 
Low fare, high cost It is still hard to make money in the airline business

covers its cost of capital, should be grateful that so few actually do.

and win a trip for two to New York staying at the exclusive Fitzpatrick Manhattan Hotel on Lexington Avenue.
You can try out financial spread-betting risk-free by logging on to www.deltaindexsimulator.
com and seeing if you can match the success of our top competition traders. Michael Aherne has maintained his 
lead in the overall leaderboard this week. The world's best fund managers would be impressed with his beautifully 
steady growth rate.
Michael is at risk of being caught though, with two contenders for his top position now having values above  
100,000. It's also all to play for in our celebrity leaderboard where Bernard Jackman and Orlaith Blaney continue to 
battle it out in aid of their chosen charities.
Our competition finishes tomorrow at 4pm, so it's now or never to place that last big trade to try to win the top prize. 
We will be announcing the winners of the competition next week so watch this space.
On the celebrity front, Bernard Jackman switched tactics by moving away from the volatility of the precious metal 
markets and into Irish equities. He is at  40,368.
Orlaith Blaney continues to see good value in Ryanair and subsequently added to her long position this week based 
on the news that Silver Jet has announced the takeover approach and Alitalia is close, thus causing the weaker 
players to re-structure or disappear.
She has built up  31,019. Fiona O'Malley saw her account value increase minute-by-minute for a while last week. 
All her trades were going the right way and she soared up the leaderboard, reaching  22,668.
Gina Quin's short position on the FTSE finally made significant profits as the Bank of England cut interest rates by a 
quarter of a percentage point. She stands at  20,382.

Tucked away in the south-west of France you'll find the departement of Aveyron.
Located in the Midi-Pyrenees, it wouldn't be the most recognisable area of France for Irish visitors, but this is all 
very likely to change. The reason? Ryanair have launched a new route to the region and, as we know, wherever 
Ryanair goes, so does a fair selection of Irish property investors.
So don't be surprised if you see plenty of column inches dedicated to this previously little-known region in the 
months ahead.
Last Saturday an entire team of French estate agents made their way to Dublin on the first ever flight from Rodez to 
Dublin. These agents are keen to promote Aveyron as a serious option for buyers, as it is one of the few remaining 
areas in France offering value for money property. This is due to the region's previous inaccessibility, which kept 
property prices amongt he lowest in France.
Of course we are well aware how a Ryanair route can rapidly change a region's fortunes. Along with new low-cost 
flight routes, the opening of the world's highest bridge - the Millau Viaduct - has greatly increased the coverage of 
this region. Local estate agents are quick to point to the likelihood that property prices will rise as Irish and British 
buyers show more interest in the area, having discovered the impressive quality of life available there.
Jean Stephane is the founder and director of Selection Habitat. He lived in Dublin in the 1990s, hence his decision 
to bring his team to Dublin to get to know the people who may well invade their market. ''The Irish market is 
certainly an attractive one for us," said Stephane.
''And we are convinced that the Irish will fall in love with this part of France as it is green and serene - just like 
Ireland - but with plenty of sunshine."
Vive la vie en France
Rodez is the capital of what many consider to be one of the prettiest departements in France, with the largest 
concentration of 'the most beautiful villages in France' - ten in total - and the largest lake in south-west France, Lake 
Pareloup.
The region is also famous as the home of Roquefort cheese. The Millau Viaduct is its most famous man-made 
landmark, linking u p traffic with the Mediterranean coast. Selection Habitat has a network of five agencies 
specialising purely in the sale of character and prestige properties. Aveyron's property reflects its agricultural 
heritage and you will still find a selection of traditional old stone farmhouses with outbuildings and land.
The company has a farmhouse in need of renovation currently on its books with over a hectare of land for  
39,500.There is also a plot of land for  40,000 and a former convent with breathtaking views. This property has a 
tower, original features and exposed beams, and is on the market for  250,000.

Time for Silverjet investors to fasten their seat belts

In a mid-air crisis, only the pilot really knows what is happening, but even first-time flyers can distinguish a dive from 
a cruise. The trajectory of shares in Silverjet has shown that investor confidence in the UK-based business-class 
airline is dropping. Until Wednesday, that is, when the stock jumped 17 per cent, obliging the company to announce 
yesterday that it was in talks that might lead to a takeover and prompting another 40 per cent rise in the stock.
Like aviation ventures since the days of Orville and Wilbur Wright, Silverjet was borne aloft only last year on a 
heady combination of aviation fuel and optimism. But you'd need a lot of the latter to buy in now. Passenger 
numbers and load factors have increased steadily since December - but so they should at a start-up that is adding 
routes. Ahead of a trading update due this month, it is hard to assess just how profitably those seats are being 
filled. The rest of the news has been gloomy. Two UK property developers declined to convert their loan to the 
group into equity in February.
A long-standing target of recording a pre-tax profit in March was missed. Silverjet is unhedged against the rising 
fuel costs that are making even established budget airlines, such as Ryanair and EasyJet, suffer. And if it's portents 
you're after, then Asian start-up Oasis Hong Kong Airlines collapsed on Wednesday.
Who, then, would want to buy this, or any airline, in the present climate? One investor in the company told 
Bloomberg on Thursday that Silverjet's aircraft and other assets could be worth Pounds 30m.
A trade buyer could purchase the entire group at roughly its equity value of some Pounds 13m in order to repay a 
Pounds 10m loan and hang on to the planes - but that would involve some racy assumptions about the second-
hand value of Boeing 767s. Alternatively, Silverjet represents a theoretical hedge against a turn in the commodities 
cycle for oil-enriched potentates. But it would be easier to offset exposure to crude by buying the beaten-down 
shares of better-established companies. Plenty of passengers would like to see the Silverjet model continue, as its 
business-class services to the US and the Gulf undercut rivals. But for ordinary investors who don't take this 
opportunity to bale out, the message seems clear: brace, brace.
Benettons' style revolt
Time for Silverjet investors to fasten their seat belts
The Benettons should have better things to do than blunder into the corporate governance dispute at Generali. The 
famous Italian textile family, which owns 1 per cent of Generali, has proposed a candidate to be elected to head the 
insurer's internal audit committee at the company's annual meeting later this month.
By doing so, they have pitched their candidate, Giuseppe Pirola, against rivals proposed by, among others, 
Algebris, the UK hedge fund waging a high-profile campaign for change at Generali.
The audit body has three members. Two are likely to come from a list put up by Generali's main shareholders, of 
which the largest is Mediobanca, the investment bank. The third, the committee's chairman, is reserved to the most 
popular candidate among minority shareholders such as Algebris.
In the country of conspiracy theories, the problem is that the Benettons are considered by some of doing 
Mediobanca a favour by trying to make life difficult for Algebris. The Benettons might well be minority investors at 
Generali, but they certainly have strong ties to Mediobanca. The two are shareholders in the controlling bloc at 
Telecom Italia; the Benettons are in the controlling bloc of Mediobanca itself; and Mediobanca is one of so far three 
large investors in the Benettons' expanded infrastructure interests.
When the Benettons presented Mr Pirola as a possible "minority" candidate, Consob, the Italian market regulator, 
asked the Benettons to explain just how they considered themselves outside the power structure at Generali.
The clothing family and the insurer responded by insisting there were no ties between the Benettons and 
Mediobanca over Generali. Consob wants more clarification and Algebris says it is considering legal action.
Assuming no conflicts of interest, no favours being played and nothing irregular, the controversy is nonetheless 
turning into an embarrassing public relations mess for the Benettons by casting suspicions on their motives and 
embroiling them in tedious regulatory inquiries.
This is not the usual Benetton style. The family group has always sought to distance itself from the Byzantine world 
of Italian politics and business. But perhaps they are feeling they should be playing a more visible role in Italian 
corporate affairs now that they are investors in everything from railway stations and airports to motorways and 
roadside restaurants. If so, they seem to have got off on the wrong footing.

Oasis Hong Kong Airlines, the start-up Asian carrier that sought to bring the low-cost airline business model into the 
long-haul sector, was forced to halt all operations yesterday as it collapsed into financial liquidation.
It is the latest casualty in the growing shake-up of global aviation as carriers struggle to cope with record oil prices 
and weakening economic growth.
At least five US airlines including Skybus, a start-up low-cost short-haul carrier, Aloha Airlines and ATA have 
collapsed in recent weeks, suffering the same fate as Maxjet Airways, the pioneer all-business class, transatlantic 
carrier, which went into liquidation in December.
In Europe, Alitalia, the lossmaking Italian flag carrier, is on the edge of bankruptcy and several leading airlines 
including British Airways, Ryanair and EasyJet have issued profit warnings. Recent start-ups and smaller operators 
have been most vulnerable to date, but analysts have already begun to warn of losses exceeding Dollars 4bn 
(Pounds 2bn) in the US industry this year.
Oasis Hong Kong Airlines began flying in October 2006 between Hong Kong and London Gatwick, offering fares 
that undercut existing carriers such as Cathay Pacific, BritishAirways and Virgin Atlantic.
It added a second route between Hong Kong and Vancouver last year with a fleet of four aircraft and had 
announced a five-year plan for it to grow to a fleet of 25 Boeing 747-400s with possible routes to include San 
Francisco, Chicago, Sydney, Milan in Italy and Cologne/Bonn in Germany.
The price of jet fuel has jumped from Dollars 600 a tonne when Oasis began flying to a current level of about 
Dollars 1,137 a tonne.
Oasis was founded by several Hong Kong investors with starting capital of Dollars 100m led by the Rev Raymond 
Lee, who also has US east coast property interests. In November, it attracted Dollars 30m in investment from a 
private equity fund run by Value Partners, the Hong Kong fund manager.
Funding dries up for Oasis
Unlike its more successful low-cost peers in short-haul markets, Oasis's service also included hot meals and inflight 
entertainment. Mark Webb, a Hong Kong-based transport analyst for HSBC, said Oasis's cost structure differed 
little from legacy airlines such as Cathay.
Stephen Miller, Oasis chief executive, said yesterday the company had applied to Hong Kong courts for a voluntary 
liquidation and was seeking new investors.

ced a five-year plan for it to grow to a fleet of 25 Boeing 747-400s with possible routes to include San Francisco, 
Chicago, Sydney, Milan in Italy and Cologne/Bonn in Germany.
The price of jet fuel has jumped from Dollars 600 a tonne when Oasis began flying to a current level of around 
Dollars 1,137 a tonne.
Oasis was founded by several Hong Kong investors with starting capital of Dollars 100m led by Reverend Raymond 
Lee, who also has US east coast property interests. In November it attracted Dollars 30m in investment from a 
private equity fund run by Value Partners, the Hong Kong fund manager.
Low-cost pioneer Oasis collapses
Unlike its more successful low-cost peers in short-haul markets, Oasis's service also included hot meals and inflight 
entertainment. Mark Webb, a Hong Kong-based transport analyst for HSBC, said Oasis's cost structure differed 
little from legacy airlines such as Cathay.
Stephen Miller, Oasis chief executive, said yesterday the company had applied to Hong Kong courts for a voluntary 
liquidation and was seeking new investors.

Fuel prices and gloom bring down start-up carriers
Fuel prices and gloom bring down start-up carriers

The sudden collapse of Oasis Hong Kong Airlines shows how quickly the pressure is rising for the world's airlines 
as they struggle to deal with surging fuel prices and softening economic growth.
Start-up carriers such as Oasis are especially vulnerable, and inevitably it is the new business models, usually 
dreamed up in the years of feast, that start to look most at risk in times of famine.
One of the first casualties of the accelerating shake-out was Maxjet, a pioneer of the new breed of all-business 
class carriers that began springing up to fly the North Atlantic three years ago.
Maxjet, US-registered but listed on Aim, London's junior market, collapsed into bankruptcy late last year.
It blamed its demise on fuel price inflation, tough competitive pressures and a decline in consumer spending.
In addition, the turmoil in the financial markets had made it impossible to raise fresh funds.
In recent weeks, at least five other US carriers have thrown in the towel, including small charter airlines.
But the casualties include Skybus, a start-up low-cost carrier with new orders in place with Airbus for 65 A319 jets, 
and well-known names such as Aloha Airlines with more than 60 years' history and ATA.
Leading US airlines are reducing capacity in the domestic market, grounding old short-haul aircraft and are 
scrambling to try to increase fares as they struggle to come to terms with an oil price of more than Dollars 100 a 
barrel. In Europe, Alitalia, the perennially lossmaking Italian flag carrier, is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy while 
the Italian unions decide whether or not to accept big job cuts and a shrinking of the airline in return for a last-ditch 
rescue by Air France-KLM.
Among the industry leaders, British Airways has already warned that profit will decline significantly during the next 
12 months. Both Ryanair and EasyJet, Europe's two biggest low-cost airlines, have issued profit warnings, with 
Ryanair saying its profit could fall by as much as 50 per cent under the impact of rising oil prices and falling fare 
levels.
Fuel prices and gloom bring down start-up carriers
"When the tide goes out, you find the business models that were never sustainable," says Chris Avery, aviation 
analyst at JPMorgan.
Oasis Hong Kong styled itself as a low-cost long-haul carrier but in reality it was more a low-fare airline with a mix of 
some of the elements of the short-haul low-cost carriers that have proved so successful, alongside some of the 
high-cost elements of the traditional full service, long-haul carriers.
Asia has become the world's fastest-growing aviation market and Derek Sadubin, chief operating officer at the 
Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, a Sydney-based consultancy, says the collapse of Oasis was unlikely to stop "a 
proliferation of new airlines in this region in the next few years".
He says Oasis had made some specific, questionable choices, however, notably devoting almost 25 per cent of its 
seating capacity to business passengers, thereby reducing the total number of seats available.
Oasis was also flying four-engine Boeing 747-400s, consuming more fuel than twin-engine aircraft. Further, as a 
stand-alone company, it did not have the brand recognition and internet booking synergies that airlines like Jetstar 
and AirAsia X have.
Mark Webb, Hong Kong-based transport analyst for HSBC, says the fate of Oasis "indicates that the low-cost long-
haul model is problematic". He adds: "Low-cost regional and short-haul models have been working in other markets 
but long-haul, low-cost hasn't really worked anywhere else. Nobody has been able to do a profitable low-cost, long-
haul carrier."
Still, Stephen Miller, Oasis chief executive, last night defended his airline's business model. "It just needed a little 
more time and a little more network (destinations), and a critical mass of aircraft . . . Oasis has shown that the 
business model is accepted by the market."
Analysts also said yesterday that the demise of Oasis would not halt moves by some Asian legacy carriers to 
develop low-cost offshoots. Among them, All Nippon Airways recently established an Asian strategy unit in Hong 
Kong to look at regional expansion and forge ties with possible joint venture partners for the launch of a low-cost 
airline.
Azran Osman-Rani, chief executive of Malaysia-based AirAsia X, said: "The Oasis example reinforces our view that 
a sustainable low-cost, long-haul airline model must stick to core principles of high aircraft utilisation and high seat 
density to achieve a sustainable cost position".

Ryanair voted against an Aer Lingus shareholder motion to buy 12 new aircraft at the flag carrier's EGM today.
Ryanair owns just over 29pc of Aer Lingus following a failed takeover bid.
"It just goes to show how little influence or control we have over Aer Lingus," the Ryanair spokeswoman said.
 A majority of Aer Lingus shareholders earlier voted in favour of the aircraft buy announced last year but some 36.4 
percent of proxy votes cast opposed the move.

Ryanair facing possible action over breaches of advertising rules - watchdog

No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings is facing potential regulatory action over what a watchdog has described as 'a 
catalogue of breaches' of advertising rules.
The United Kingdom's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it has asked the UK's Office of Fair Trading 
(OFT) to consider taking action against Ryanair over alleged repeated infringements of the Code of Advertising 
Practice, which aims to protect consumers and promote fair competition.
The ASA said in a statement it had formally investigated complaints about Ryanair's advertisements in the past two 
years and had found the company had breached the rules seven times.
It said Ryanair was persistently misleading consumers by making exaggerated claims about the extent of flight 
availability at the advertised price and advertising prices that were not inclusive of taxes and charges.
The ASA also said in a statement that Ryanair had made misleading and denigratory comparisons with competitors, 
had not stated clearly significant restrictions that would exclude customers from taking advantage of an offer and 
had not provided evidence to prove the claims it was making.
ASA director-general Chris Graham said the action was 'disappointing but absolutely necessary'.
'The ASA has given Ryanair every opportunity to put its house in order and ensure its advertising adheres to the 
codes,' he said.
'Instead, they have continued to mislead consumers and denigrate competitors.
'We would prefer to work with advertisers within the self-regulatory system rather than call in a statutory body, but 
Ryanair's approach has left us with no option but to refer them to the OFT, which will consider appropriate action.'
On Friday, Ryanair complained to the OFT about the seven rulings made by the ASA against the company's 
advertisements.
The carrier claimed the ASA had demonstrated 'a repeated lack of independence, impartiality or fairness where 
Ryanair is concerned by making factually inaccurate and untrue findings in response (in some cases) to totally 
baseless and unsubstantiated alleged complaints.'
Ryanair facing possible action over breaches of advertising rules - watchdog
Under the Control of Misleading Advertisements Regulations 1988, the OFT can ultimately apply for a High Court 
injunction to prevent companies printing misleading advertisements.
An OFT spokesman confirmed it had received the ASA referral. 'The OFT is considering what action would be 
appropriate and proper in the circumstances,' he said.

## Quinlan Private has attracted heavy-hitting American businesswoman Barbara Cassani to chair its Jurys Inns, 
having finally completed an equity fundraising of more than 400m euro for the 1.165bn euro purchase of the budget 
hotels chain last summer, industry sources said. Ms Cassani came to prominence a decade ago when she founded 
low-cost airline Go Fly for British Airways before leading a management buyout of the carrier in 2001 with the 
financial backing of venture capital firm 3i. She parted company with Go a year later as it was bought by rival

 ## Grocery wholesale group ADM Londis has announced a new deal with Texoil, which runs Texaco branded 
forecourts around the country. The deal will see Londis opening convenience stores at Texaco filling stations. New 
Londis stores will be rolled out across ten existing forecourt locations in Munster and Connacht in 2008, with the 
first two opening by the end of June. Another ten stores are in the pipeline for 2009. - RTE ## Irish Nationwide chief

against the aviation regulator's recent approval of a 50pc hike in check-in desk charges at Dublin Airport. The move 
would mark Aer Lingus' first legal challenge to the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the airline's first joint

Britain's advertising regulator on Wednesday sought action against Ryanair for advertising it alleges is misleading 
and unfair.
The Advertising Standards Authority said the Dublin-based budget airline had repeatedly breached regulations.
Last week, Ryanair filed a complaint to the Office of Fair Trading about alleged "unfair procedures, bias and 
factually untrue rulings" by the ASA.
The ASA alleged that Ryanair Ltd. exaggerated claims about the availability of flights at the advertised price; 
publicized prices that exclude taxes and charges; made derogatory comparisons with competitors; and hid 
significant flight restrictions.
"The ASA has given Ryanair every opportunity to put its house in order and ensure that its advertising adheres to

The agency said it last referred a complaint about a company to the Office of Fair Trading in 2005.

Aer Lingus and United Airlines announced a code-sharing partnership Tuesday that will allow customers to book 
seamless flights using each other's networks.
The airlines jointly announced that United chief executive Glenn Tilton and Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot 
Mannion signed the agreement in Chicago. They said customers could start booking the joined-up services in 
September for flights on or after Nov. 1.
Industry analysts said the deal, which requires U.S. regulatory approval, will increase U.S. tourist and business 
traffic through Ireland at the expense of neighboring Britain, where increased security delays and chronic problems 
at Heathrow Airport in particular have made Europe-bound travelers seek a different hub.
United's senior vice president for alliances and regulatory Affairs, Michael Whitaker, said the deal would "give our 
customers more nonstop destinations across the Atlantic."
Aer Lingus said its trans-Atlantic services to seven U.S. cities would all begin carrying United codes, while members 
of either carrier's loyalty programs would be able to redeem their points on flights operated by both airlines.
The deal should help Aer Lingus fill empty seats on its expanding short-haul network to other parts of Europe. The 
Irish airline, which was privatized in September 2006, faces the toughest local competition in Europe in the form of 
cutthroat budget airline Ryanair.
The Irish are increasingly opting to fly to the United States, rather than Europe, to exploit the exceptional weakness 
of the U.S. dollar. Weekend shopping trips to New York are particularly common.
Mannion said the deal would allow more Irish and other Europeans to reach United's more than 200 destinations 
without having to make separate bookings or collect their luggage midway.
Aer Lingus flies into four of United's U.S. hubs: Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington.
Aer Lingus , United Airlines announce code-sharing partnership to start Nov. 1
"We believe that this agreement will strengthen our position in the U.S. market as we capitalize on the scale and the 
strength of the United Airlines network," Mannion said in a statement.

News In Brief
## Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary says a pay freeze for senior managers has been extended to more 
staff. The carrier, which last month froze the pay for about 30 senior executives this year, said the salaries of its 
staff not on multi-year pay agreements have been frozen. Those affected by the freeze include pilots and cabin 
crew. The airline did not say what percentage of its more than 3,000 staff are affected. - Irish Examiner
## Shares in insurance company FBD gained almost 16.5 per cent yesterday to close at 34 euro last night on news 
of a preliminary approach from Dutch financial giant Eureko at about E36 per share. - Irish Times 
 ## The Takeover Panel is believed to have asked businessman Denis O'Brien to clarify whether he intends 
mounting a bid for Independent News & Media (INM) after the London Observer quoted "sources" close to him 
indicating that was his ultimate intention. - Irish Times Sales grew by 10pc last year to 2.2 billion euro at the 
SuperValu supermarket chain, it has announced. The chain, which is owned by the Musgrave group, opened nine 
new stores during the year with an investment of 17.6 million euro, while a further 36 stores were refurbished at a 
cost of 57.8m euro.# It says that it created more than 1,300 jobs last year, and will provide a further 700 this year, 
bringing the total number of people working at the chain to 13,000. The chain, which is owned by the Musgrave 
Group, also said it plans to invest 25m euro this year in the opening of eight stores, with a further 39m euro being 
spent on the further development of another 41 existing stores. The results were

Mobile phone use on aircraft flying in European airspace moved closer to commercial reality yesterday after 
regulatory backing for a European Union-wide approach to technical standards for the service.
The decision by the European Commission to harmonise technical and licensing rules should boost the introduction 
of the technology, which is already under commercial trial by Air France-KLM.
BMI British Midland and TAP Air Portugal will also conduct tests, while Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier, is 
expected to be the first airline to make widespread use of the service with a plan to begin introducing it across its 
fleet this year.
Under yesterday's decision, passengers' mobile phones will be linked to an onboard network connected to the 
ground via satellite.
Travellers will have to switch off their handsets for take-off and landing, with phones allowed to be used once 
aircraft are at altitudes above 3,000 metres.
Viviane Reding, EU telecoms commissioner, said: "One regulatory decision for all European airspace was required 
for this new service to come into being."
Ms Reding last year brought legislation that forced telecoms companies to slash the fees customers pay for cross-
border phone use, but those rules would not apply to in-flight calls. However, she would "closely monitor" prices 
levied for the new service.
National licences for in-flight mobile use granted to airlines by the member state in which they are registered will be 
recognised throughout the 27-country union.
The Air France trial service has been operating on an Airbus A318 flying on short-haul routes in Europe.
When the trial began in December, passengers were able to send and receive text and picture messages as well as 
e-mails via phones with internet access.
Europe moves closer to in-flight mobile phone use
The second stage of the six-month trial was launched last week, and passengers are now able to make and receive 
voice calls.
Many airlines are still wary about introducing the full use of mobile phones because of the disturbance to other 
passengers. Surveys have shown that passenger opinion is sharply divided, with similar numbers for and against 
in-flight mobile use.
Air France said passenger feedback had been positive so far. Findings from the trial would help decide whether the 
airline would offer data only or data and voice services. Calls are billed via users' existing service providers at 
international roaming rates.
The carrier is using the on-board mobile phone service developed by OnAir, a joint venture owned by Airbus and 
Sita. A rival system has been developed by AeroMobile, a joint venture between Arinc and Telenor.

To get a grip on airport charges, EU governments agreed Monday to force airports to defend those costs, which 
airlines add to airfares.
The EU transport ministers agreed that all airports in the 27-nation European Union handling more than 5 million 
passengers a year must consult airlines on how they calculate the charges and the service they provide in 
exchange. There are 67 such airports in the EU.
If airlines find the costs unfair they can appeal to an independent regulatory body.
The ministers also updated rules on airlines-owned computerized reservations systems to provide more choice and 
lower costs for travelers.
Europe's three computer reservations systems providers are owned by airlines and account for 60 percent of all EU 
airline bookings. They give travel agents realtime flight details but, over the years, airlines have increasingly used 
their own web sites to lure passengers with better deals.
The new EU rules give CRS providers the right to freely negotiate booking fees so they can compete with 
alternative bookings via the Internet, officials said.
The new rules on airport charges are meant to end friction between airlines and airports over what are fair charges.
Europe's largest budget carrier, Ryanair Holdings PLC, has been in a disagreement with London's Stansted and 
Dublin airports over increased charges to pay for new terminals.
Stansted doubled charges in April and will increase fees again this year as it builds a 4 billion pound ($7.9 billion) 
second terminal.

The European Commission on Monday unveiled plans to enable air passengers across the European Union to 
make and receive in-flight phone calls, removing a major obstacle for telecoms operators who want to launch this 
service this year.
Under the new rules, airlines would be granted national licences by the EU member states in which they are 
registered.
These licences would be recognised throughout the EU, allowing airlines registered in France or Spain to offer 
mobile phone services when flying over Germany or Hungary without any additional licensing procedures.
Airlines such as Air France, BMI British Midlands and Ryanair are planning to hold or are currently holding trials, 
and telecoms groups are keen to launch the service.
Passengers' phones will be linked to an onboard cellular network connected to the ground via satellite, and will be 
prevented from connecting directly to mobile networks on the ground below.
This will ensure that transmission powers are kept low enough for mobile phones to be used without affecting the 
safety of aircraft equipment or the normal operation of terrestrial mobile networks.
Airlines need to install mobile communication services on aircraft (MCA) equipment, which is produced by several 
mobile equipment manufacturers.
It consists of a 'picocell' (a very small mobile base station or mobile 'mast') and a 'Network Control Unit'.
The Network Control Unit stops onboard phones from trying to connect directly with land-based cellular networks, 
which are not designed to deal with high-speed movement.
Until now, the potential disturbance to land-based mobile networks was one reason for prohibiting mobile phone 
use in planes.
Fears that mobile phone transmissions would interfere with on-board navigation equipment have also been quelled 
since mobile phones need much less power to connect to a base station that is only a few metres away and on 
board the aircraft itself.
EU clears path for in-flight mobile phone use
New regulation proposed today does not cover the pricing of in-flight mobile phone use, but the EU says it will 
closely monitor the levels and transparency of charges.
It also recognises the potential annoyance of in-flight mobile phone conversations, and calls on operators to create 
the right conditions on board aircraft to ensure customers using the service do not disturb other passengers.
Air France says it will assess at the end of their six-month trial period whether customers prefer a service limited to 
sending and receiving text messages and e-mails or a full service which also allows them to make and receive 
calls.
BMI, which will trial in-flight mobile phone services for six months starting in June says it will also study customers' 
feedback on the service closely.

Ryanair today said it is seeking a High Court appeal against the Aviation Regulator over its decision to allow a 50pc 
hike in Dublin Airport check-in desk charges.
The no-frills airline today said it is also appealing against the Regulator, Cathal Guiomard's decision to permit an 
increase in charges to airlines for check-in kiosks.
"These price increases, which are more than ten times the rate of inflation, mean that the Regulator is again in 
breach of his statutory duties to 'protect the reasonable interests' of Dublin Airport users. Instead of regulating the 
Dublin Airport monopoly, Mr Guiomard has conspired with the DAA to rubberstamp further unjustified price 
increases," Ryanair said.
 Ryanair claims that the "DAA monopoly refused to show users the basis for these further abusive price increases 
and dismissed user requests for this information saying it had been "sent directly to the Aviation Regulator". "Cathal 
Guiomard has no credibility as an independent regulator and it is time he resigned or was dismissed. He is a 
regulatory poodle, rubber stamping unjustified price increases and double charging at the Government owned DAA 
Monopoly. Airport costs at most UK and European airports are falling thanks to lower cost facilities and competition. 
But in Ireland this failed Regulator is allowing repeated, unjustified, inflation busting price increases at the DAA 
monopoly," the airline's chief executive, Michael O'Leary said.

Search is the most frequent activity carried out by Internet users with Google being the most popular search engine 
- visited monthly by 78pc of all Irish online users per month. Yahoo comes second with 45pc of online searchers, 
followed by MSN with 36pc and Ask (formerly Ask Jeeves) 17pc, the Net Behaviour Report showed.
Media-wise RTE.ie topped the ratings with 46pc of the Irish online population visiting RTE.ie monthly, followed by 
Independent.ie 26pc, Skynews.com 23pc, IrishExaminer.ie 21pc and Ireland.com 19pc.
 Music downloads are a prominent part of Internet life and no less so in Ireland where 30pc of the online population 
access iTunes. The phenomenon of social networking has taken off in Ireland in recent years, particularly among 
younger Internet users. Bebo is more popular among 22 to 29 year olds, than for any other age group, with 36pc of 
this age group using it, compared with 24pc of the total sample. While 20pc of Irish Internet users visit MySpace, 
this is 28pc for those between 22 to 29 years of age. In the commercial sector, travel plays a big part in people's 
online usage whether that is to search for or book a trip. BudgetTravel.com and LastMinute.com share the position 
of Ireland's most visited travel website(s) with 21pc of all Irish web users visiting. Of the airlines, Aer Lingus and 
Ryanair are tied with 48pc of all Irish web users seeking flights from those providers. Aer Arann receives visits from

No-frills airline, Ryanair, has made an official complaint to the UK's Office of Fair Trading against rulings made by 
the advertising watchdog against the Irish airline.
Ryanair said it has submitted the complaint regarding the "unfair procedures, bias and factually untrue rulings made 
by the ASA against seven of Ryanair's adverts over the past two years".
"The ASA has demonstrated a repeated lack of independence, impartiality or fairness where Ryanair is concerned 
by making factually inaccurate and untrue findings in response (in some cases) to totally baseless and 
unsubstantiated alleged complaints," Ryanair alleged.
 The ASA has ruled against several of Ryanair' more controversial ads including the "greedy Gordon Brown" advert 
where the ASA ruled that the UN and Stern Report's CO2 emissions figures were factually inaccurate. It also ruled 
against Ryanair's Eurostar ad, "saying that a 2 hour 11 minute train journey was "not necessarily" slower than a 1 
hour 10 minute flight, and a higher Eurostar fare of £27 was "not necessarily" more expensive than a lower £15 air 
fare," Ryanair said.

Ryanair has started an inquiry after one of its Boeing 737-800s skidded off the runway while landing at Limoges in 
France on 21 March.
None of the 175 passengers or six crew members was injured when flight FR1216, operating from Brussels 
Charleroi, overran at about 16:00. 
Ryanair says the aircraft came to a halt on a grass run-off zone about 10m (33ft) from the far end of the runway. 
Limoges has a single runway, 03/21, with a length of around 2,500m.
"The captain initiated an emergency exit and passengers were evacuated using the aircraft slides and were 
transferred by bus to the terminal building," says Ryanair.
The carrier states that the runway was wet and the airport was subject to gusting winds. Meteorological data 
indicates rain at the time and winds from the northeast gusting to 34kt (63km/h). The airline says: "Prevailing 
conditions were within safety limits."
Irish and French investigators were notified about the accident and Ryanair says it has opened its own inquiry into 
the event.

While most small firms have worries about the economy, some 72pc still believe their company will grow over the 
next year, the latest joint HP/Small Firms Association All-island Survey revealed.
The survey also shows that the majority of businesses are planning for today, but not the future.
Only 29pc of small businesses are looking more than one year ahead when making business plans with owners 
more focused on daily concerns and ensuring the survival of the business without the capacity to invest in planning 
and strategies for the long-term future, it found.
 According to Patricia Callan, Director of the Small Firms Association, long-term planning is essential for small 
business survival and growth, but too few owner-managers take the time to invest in themselves and learn how to 
strategise into the medium to long-term. "Without these skills, they may be unable to survive cyclical downturns in 
their business or may not have the appropriate framework in place for succession. Earlier research has shown that 
fewer than one in three family businesses survive to the second generation - greater investment in strategic 
planning could ensure that these businesses are thinking ahead and in a position to overcome short-term 
downturns," she said. Of the 79pc of small businesses who expect to expand their business over the coming year, 
66pc within the Republic, 20pc in the North and 20pc abroad. Northern small businesses, 17pc of whom have only 
been established in the last year, gave a clear signal of their intentions with 30pc expressing an ambition to develop 
their business offering in the South, so the expectation would be that there will be an increase in the number of 
Northern Irish companies seeking to make their mark on the Southern market over the coming year. However 
owners of small businesses are working longer and harder than ever before with 63pc of owner-managers 
indicating that they don't manage to take their full yearly entitlement to annual leave and 47pc missing important 
family events due to work commitments. The study also found that 55pc of males as compared to 32pc of females 
work on average over 50 hours a week, while almost half of business men and women, 47pc, regularly work 
72pc small business still expect growth
weekends. Michael O'Leary remains top of the list as most inspirational business leader with the Ryanair giant's 
aggressive and hugely successful approach to business making him the most admired business figure both North 
and South of the border. However 42pc of people said that a family member had been their most inspirational 
figures throughout their business career, above mentors, colleagues or friends, demonstrating the impact family 
often has in motivating people to set up their own business and encouraging them to continue. According to Martin 
Cullen, Head of HP's Personal Systems Group, "The results of this survey clearly demonstrate that small business 
owners are working longer and harder than ever before. This is a trend that is mirrored across all businesses and 
there is a real challenge for us to provide solutions that will accommodate people in juggling the demands of family 
life and business commitments."

Shares in Vueling Airlines SA resumed trade sharply higher after core shareholder Grupo Planeta's investment 
vehicle Inversiones Hemisferio SL said it is continuing merger talks with domestic low-cost peer Clickair.
At 12:25 p.m., Vueling rose 0.62 euros or 6.80 percent to 9.74 on about 339,633 shares.
The IBEX-35 dropped 180.30 points or 1.35 percent to 13,260.30.
Trading in Vueling securities was suspended ahead of the market open pending the statement and following reports 
the no-frills airline was initiating merger talks with Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA's low cost carrier.
Iberia holds 20 percent of Clickair.
Earlier, Bolsacinco news website also cited unnamed sources close to the talks as saying that a merger is the only 
way the two airlines can avoid bankruptcy, adding that the core shareholders for both companies are in agreement 
on this.
A tie-up between Vueling and Clickair would be to some extent a defensive move against the stiff competition from 
major low cost players such as EasyJet PLC or Ryanair Holdings PLC, against a backdrop of escalating fuel costs 
and slowing economic growth.

Ireland to follow British ruling on mobile use on planes

Comreg will soon give airlines the green light to allow the use of mobile phones on planes within Irish airspace, The 
Sunday Business Post understands. Sources close to negotiations on the issue said a positive decision is likely by 
the end of April.
The go-ahead will follow last week's ruling, by British telecoms regulator Ofcom, that mobile phones can now be 
used by passengers in commercial aircraft above the altitude of 3,000 metres within British airspace.
Ryanair looks set to become the first mass-market carrier into Ireland to introduce the service, with calls likely to 
cost around  1 per minute. British Midland will soon follow. However, Aer Lingus looks unlikely to introduce the 
technology any time soon.
''We have no plans in the short-term to do this," said a spokeswoman for the airline.
''Operationally, we understand that the aircraft has to be taken out of service for three weeks, and that's not 
practical for us. Maybe when the technology becomes easier to fit, we might consider it."
However, this estimate is disputed by the head of the country's second-largest aeronautical mobile technology 
suppliers, Kerry-based Altobridge.
''It certainly wouldn't require a plane to be grounded for three weeks to install," said Mike Fitzgerald, chief executive 
of Altobridge. ''That may have been true a few years ago, but not today."
Altobridge's technology is being used by the first major airline to operate an onboard mobile phone service, 
Emirates.
The company supplying the technology to Ryanair, OnAir, said the budget airline will levy a per-minute charge at 
international roaming rates, rather than intra-EU roaming rates, which are capped at 60 cent per minute. The 
spokesman said this was because the technology cost more to deploy than conventional terrestrial networks.
Ireland to follow British ruling on mobile use on planes
Last week, both Emirates and Air France launched in-flight mobile phone services, and the technology is expected 
to be deployed within most European airlines over the next two years.
The technology works using mobile base stations installed on the aircraft. Cellular signals are relayed via satellite to 
terrestrial mobile base stations. The onboard base stations can be switched on or off by cabin crew.
However, although devices such as Blackberries will be operable, the technology will be limited to 2G and 2.5G 
networks.
''In terms of safety, the industry has been ready for this for years,'' said Fitzgerald. ''It's largely been a question of 
stringent equipment certification and a lengthy regulatory approval process."
However, individual British airlines wishing to turn the service on must now apply for regulatory approval from the 
European Aviation Safety Authority, in respect of the equipment they plan to use to control the mobile calls.
The airlines also need approval from the British Civil Aviation Authority in the proper training of cabin crews to deal 
with the new technology.

The telecoms regulator, ComReg, looks set to allow the use of mobile phones on commercial airlines flying to and 
from Ireland.
A spokesman said a public consultation had been carried out and ''we are in the process of finishing the response 
to that consultation, which is expected to be published in the coming weeks''. However, sources close to the 
deliberations say a positive decision is expected by the end of April.
The go-ahead will follow last week's ruling by ComReg's British counterpart, Ofcom, that mobile phones can now be 
used by airline passengers within British airspace.
Ryanair has stated that it intends to introduce the service later in the year, while British Midland has also 
announced its intention to launch the service.
A spokeswoman for Aer Lingus said it had no plans to launch a mobile service. Last week, Emirates Airlines 
became the first international airline to permit passengers to use their mobile phones during flights.
Ryanair will launch its service ''at international roaming rates'', according to a spokesman for the firm supplying the 
technology to the airline.
''Ryanair passengers will pay an international roaming charge, which is higher than the 60 cent per minute EU 
roaming charge," said the spokesman for OnAir. ''That's because it costs more to operate the service at 30,000 
feet."
Calls will be enabled through mobile base stations on the aircraft which will communicate with satellites.

You can enter today and try out financial spread betting risk-free, by logging on to www.deltaindexsimulator.com, 
and see if you can take the top spot on the leaderboard.
The top two in our overall leaderboard invested heavily in wheat going up last week, but sadly, it failed to move and 
continued its recent slide.
This has dumped our longtime frontrunner Kevin Healy out of the top 10 altogether - but not before he was able to 
claim his EUR 500 trader of the month prize. Daragh Granahan has seen a large chunk of his portfolio value 
dissipate too, but he has managed to maintain the lead.
Francis Cooke is his nearest competition now, and he is hoping for a fall in oil to further pump up his account value. 
As the finish line approaches, our leaderboard is getting tighter, with dozens of hopefuls within striking distance. 
Our celebrity traders' race also remains tight.
Bernard Jackman Bernard shorted the Dow twice last week, taking in EUR 5,130 profit in three days and staying 
top of the leaderboard. He stayed away from gold and silver due to uncertainty and is happy to rest on his laurels.
Orlaith Blaney Orlaith decided to shift her trading strategy towards the Irish equity market, as she saw great value in 
Ryanair. She took a long position on Ryanair, just below the level where its management had been buying. A longer 
term view will be taken in this position, in comparison with her typically short-term indices-based trading strategy. 
Her current account value is EUR 29,345.
Fiona O'Malley Fiona's short position in the Dow Jones didn't work out too well, and she was stopped out during the 
week. Not to be perturbed, she waited for a better entry point later on in the week. Thus missing the rest of the rally, 
Fiona has re-established her short position in the Dow, hoping for a reversal.

Gina Quin Soyabean has been discussed as an environmentally friendly bio-diesel, and hence the reason for Gina 
taking a position late last week. The charts showed a promising entry point, but in a tough week for commodities, 
her position was stopped out.
Conor Brophy Conor is still holding up the mid-table, after taking a break from the markets for a few days. He's 
keeping a keen eye from the sidelines until more opportunities present themselves in the days ahead.
Richard Dunwoody Richard's trade took a turn for the worse, as his short on the Dow and GBP/USD both got 
closed out at his stop loss. News on Monday that JP Morgan had raised its bid for Bear Stearns and stronger 
housing numbers drove the Dow higher. He is now carefully considering an entry point to short the FTSE.

Thanks to heavy investment the largest Balearic island is being rejuvenated, writes Cathy Hawker.
Dublin-born Anne Marie Godfrey Fawcett has spent the past 30 years living on the Mediterranean island of 
Mallorca, initially setting up home in the capital of Palma before moving to the north-west.
The changes she has seen are dramatic and a clear indicator of the authority's plan in recent years to take the 
largest Balearic Island upmarket.
''Thirty years ago Palma was decrepit and everyone was moving out to new villas on the outskirts," she says. ''Now 
the city is regenerated and people are moving back, buying apartments within the city walls. They appreciate the 
history of one-ofa-kind buildings with unique views."
Palma is certainly no longer crumbling and Anne Marie has had a hand in changing its fortunes. She and her 
husband own Cala 24, an award-winning architectural company specialising in the restoration of beautiful palacios 
in Palma's Old Town. Cala 24 has an impressive portfolio of completed work featuring renewed stonework, fabulous 
courtyards and imaginative conversions of noble houses into apartments.
Their main project is Can Riera, a 17th Century palacio being renovated as a four-bedroom family house with guest 
suite, indoor pool, two roof terraces and two garages. It is on the market for a whopping  8 million but with most 
palacios in the Old Town converted into apartments, the value of this family house with both Renaissance and 
Baroque detail should make it an attractive investment, according to agent Terence Panton of Engel & Volkers.
''Palma attracts buyers from across Europe and also those who already own houses elsewhere on Mallorca but 
want a city base," says Panton. ''This is a year-round city with excellent infrastructure, wonderful weather and a 
good buzz. Palma has shops and restaurants and a great art scene so there is always something to do."
Palma - like most of Mallorca - has escaped the dire problems of the Spanish mainland, according to local agents, 
and the property market is stable. New hotels and marinas packed with gleaming yachts show there is money here.
Sun shining on
Some  23 million is being spent on a new jetty at Palma Quay. The city is already the third-busiest cruise 
destination in the Mediterranean, bringing in a million customers last year, while its impressive airport has good 
connections throughout western Europe including, from March this year, Ryanair flights from Shannon and Dublin.
The average spend for a good quality two or three-bedroom apartment in Palma is  450,000 to  550,000,with the 
fishing village of Portixol and the Old Town particularly sought after areas. Both have little space for new build 
property though.
Engel & Volkers has a large development of attractive new apartments overlooking Portixol harbour priced from  
816,200 for two bedrooms up to  1.166 million for a five-bedroom penthouse. The steep price has not deterred 
buyers a Dublin-based purchaser has already snapped up one penthouse.
Other interesting property in Palma includes a fully renovated two-bedroom apartment near historic Pla a Cort for  
625,000 or, just outside the Old Town, a three-bedroom apartment in Avenidas for  529,000.
Elsewhere on Mallorca, infrastructural improvements are changing the island, with more than  4 million spent on 
transport alone since 2000. Mallorca now boasts 23 golf courses, 15 top spas and more than 200 four and five-star 
hotels.
Irish buyers have traditionally headed to the golf courses close to Santa Ponsa but Dominique Carroll from the 
Mallorcan Tourist Board says it is the north-west of the island, centred on the traditional stone houses of Deia and 
Soller Town, that is attracting new interest.
''In 1997 a tunnel was built through the Tramuntana Mountains which cut the journey time from Palma to around 40 
minutes," says Carroll. ''Ignored by overseas buyers because of its relative inaccessibility, the north-west is 
undeveloped and has kept its authentic Spanish flavour. Now new investments - including a seven-star Jumeirah 
hotel and further tunnels around Soller - are bringing new buyers."
Soller Town has a lively central square filled with fountains and bars. Two-bedroom apartments in the narrow 
streets cost from  220,000, unrestored houses from  300,000 and a restored three-bedroom townhouse from  
450,000.
Typical properties in the town are tall, thin townhouses, rarely with parking. Buyers here like the proximity to the 
restaurants and bars and can always use the vintage train to take the scenic one-hour journey into Palma.
Avintage tram connects Soller Town with Puerto Soller, a picturesque harbour a mile away. Property is more 
expensive here with a one-bedroom apartment costing  350,000. The Soller 2010 project plans to spruce up the 
port with the demolition of large ugly military buildings and the introduction of a pedestrianised waterfront.
Michael Cunnington of Savills Associate MJC Associates, said: ''The south-west of Mallorca is so crowded that 
buyers are looking elsewhere and Soller has become very desirable. The problems on the Spanish mainland have 
encouraged more buyers to come to Mallorca where prices are stable and there is no real sign of a downturn."
Close to Soller, but in quiet countryside, Engel & Volkers has a charming two-bedroom stone house with beamed 
ceilings, exposed stone walls and a garden for  495,000, as well as a fabulous finca and estate with mountain views 
for  4.9 million. This estate has three separate buildings, an olive grove, six terraces and a large outdoor pool.
Andrew Hawkins of Chesterton International, said: ''In the last decade Mallorca has consolidated its position as 
Spain's top upmarket destination. Urban planners prevented new development for two years until 2004 and, as a 
result, prices are higher than the mainland but with little over-development."
The south-west is the most developed and expensive part of the island, but Hawkins says the north offers value for 
money. ''The coastline around this part of the island is stunning," he said. ''One-bedroom apartments start from 
around  230,000."

Bush administration officials vowed Friday to more strictly enforce antitrust law in their remaining months in office, 
while their European counterparts struck a more conciliatory tone.
In remarks to a lawyers' group, the goal seemed to combat the perception among many antitrust experts that the 
European Union enforces antitrust law with a vengeance in contrast to a too-lax approach in the U.S.
Thomas Barnett, the Justice Department's top antitrust official, said the agency will pursue "aggressive but 
appropriate merger enforcement." The department faced criticism earlier this week for clearing without conditions 
Sirius Satellite Radio Inc.'s $5 billion purchase of its only rival, XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc.
"People wonder, 'are we afraid to litigate a merger case?'" Barnett said. While the department has been able to 
settle many recent cases out of court, he said, "We are willing to litigate."
Sen. Herb Kohl (D-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust, said Monday he 
was "particularly disturbed" by the Sirius-XM decision, "given the Justice Department's record in recent years of 
failing to oppose numerous mergers ... resulting in the Justice Department not bringing a single contested merger 
case in nearly four years."
Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have lost several high-profile antitrust cases in recent years. The two 
agencies share enforcement of competition laws.
Justice failed to block Oracle Corp.'s acquisition of PeopleSoft in 2004, while a court ruled against the FTC last year 
when it sought to halt Whole Foods Market Inc.'s purchase of Wild Oats Markets.
Some analysts have suggested that companies considering deals that might face antitrust scrutiny should seek to 
initiate the transactions soon in order to have them scrutinized by the Bush administration rather than its successor.
But Deborah Platt Majoras, outgoing chairwoman of the FTC, said "I wouldn't expect a real slowdown" in 
enforcement between now and November. Majoras spoke with Barnett and Neelie Kroes, the European 
Commission's top antitrust enforcer, before the American Bar Association.
US, EU Antitrust Units Review Approaches
Friday was Majoras' last day on the job. She will be replaced March 30 by William Kovacic, a current FTC 
commissioner.
Regarding those who may think the FTC is reluctant to fight a merger in court, "I wouldn't make that mistake either," 
Majoras said.
Kroes, meanwhile, sought to counter what she called the perception that European antitrust regulators are 
"antibusiness, and socialist even."
"There is not that much difference" between EU and U.S. antitrust enforcers, she said.
Last year, the European Commission blocked only one acquisition out of 400 that it was notified about, she said. In 
June, the commission said Ryanair's efforts to purchase its rival Irish airline, Aer Lingus, would create a monopoly.
The EU has taken a much tougher stance against Microsoft Corp.'s alleged monopolistic conduct than the U.S. has, 
fining the software giant a total of $2.4 billion in the past several years.
European authorities are also investigating Intel Corp. for alleged anticompetitive conduct, while the FTC has so far 
refused to begin a similar probe.
Andrew Gavil, an antitrust law professor at Howard University, said the Bush administration has been "much more 
cautious" than the EU about enforcing competition law against companies such as Microsoft,which dominate their 
industries.
But that could change with the next administration, he said, which would narrow the gap between U.S. and 
European enforcement.
Meanwhile, Kroes and Barnett stressed that the two sides increasingly cooperate when evaluating large 
acquisitions.
"There's a lot more convergence here than people like to talk about," Barnett said. He cited financial data and news 
provider Thomson Corp.'s purchase of Reuters Group PLC, which was cleared on the same day last month by U.S. 
and EU regulators, as an example.

No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said it plans to close its Dublin telesales operation, with the potential loss of 
up to 40 jobs.
Ryanair said the closure, which is scheduled for the end of May, is part of a cost-cutting programme aimed at 
combating record oil prices.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary described the decision as a 'painful one', but said the operation was no longer 
viable or cost-competitive against a background of declining demand for telephone bookings, which now account for 
less than 1 pct of its sales, against 99 pct done over the internet.
O'Leary said the group's existing Romanian and German call centres will continue to provide telesales services at 
costs 60 pct lower than those of the Dublin operation.
'These kinds of cost savings must be made if Ryanair is to remain Europe's lowest cost airline in these difficult 
recessionary markets,' he said.
'Whilst we will be encouraging these telesales people to apply for other vacancies in Ryanair, should they not apply 
or be successful, then they will be made redundant at the end of May.
'While record high oil prices and falling fares continue, it is sensible and prudent that we streamline our business 
and reduce costs.'

by forgoing a pay increase for the next year.
"It's going to be very painful for the next 12 months," he said. "It's not going to be pretty for profits this year and it's 
not going to be pretty for our shareholders.''
He repeated guidance that profits for the financial year from March 31 could fall by as much as 50 per cent to Euros 
235m if oil remained as high as Dollars 100 a barrel.
The company, which had hedged 10 per cent of its fuel at Dollars 70 a barrel, faced paying full prices from April 1. 
Mr O'Leary said it would not hedge again as he expected prices to fall because of lower demand in the US.
He refused to contemplate price increases. "We are targeting a senior management pay freeze, airport and 
handling cost reductions, staff costs. We are looking at every other element of cost that exists," he said.
However, Mr O'Leary said Ryanair could profit from the crisis as several rival airlines could go out of business, 
giving Ryanair expansion opportunities. It was on course to almost double in size by 2012 to 300 aircraft, he said. 
The share price would "significantly in-crease" over that time, he added.
Mr O'Leary earned a basic salary of Euros 565,000, a bonus of Euros 365,000 and received pension contributions 
of Euros 62,000 in the year to March 31 2007, the latest figures available. Details are not available for any other 
executives.

Q: How do you know what you'll get to eat on a flight? On a recent mid-morning flight from London City Airport to 
Zurich in BA economy I was provided with a sandwich. On the return flight (to Gatwick), scheduled to depart at 
7pm, there was nothing but a packet of nibbles - even though it was dinnertime. The stewardess told me the flight 
was too short for meal service. Why the inconsistency?
JC, UK-based consultant.
A: There doesn't appear to be any reliable, central source of information on the type of food you'll get. It appears 
airlines are anxious to keep their options open. For example, information on one flight provided by timetable 
specialist OAG showed there might either be no meal service or catering "appropriate to the time of day". And an 
early-morning flight from Edinburgh to Amsterdam, presented as an option via KDS self-booking tool, showed 
passengers would be offered a "snack or brunch".
BA tells me it tries to tailor food to the time of day. "We recognise that sometimes due to operational difficulties or 
delays some customers are regrettably eating maybe a mid-afternoon snack into the evening when they should be 
having a more substantial amount of food.
"We are constantly reviewing what types of free food and drinks we do offer to ensure that we stay competitive. 
Many...airlines now charge substantial amounts...(but) BA has no plans to charge customers for on-board meals 
and drinks."
Q: Why don't airlines just weld seats upright in economy class. Personally, I never recline. I don't see how anyone 
gets anything out of reclining a seat six degrees. However, when you do, it makes a huge difference to the 
passenger behind you. Their already minimal space is cut in half. Can't eat, can't use a laptop, even reading can be 
a challenge.
I have the sneaking suspicion that people recline only out of habit or to assert privilege and not because they 
actually gain any comfort. The worst are those who recline the seat as they sit down when first getting on the plane, 
grudgingly raise it when told to for take off and then slam it back as soon as the plane hits 10,000 feet.
PBJ software sales executive,
Agony Uncle
Washington, DC
A: It seems you could become a big fan of Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair, none of whose aircraft has reclining seats. 
This is not out of consideration for long-legged customers, however, but to keep maintenance costs down. Why 
don't more airlines do it? The world's largest, American Airlines, says it tries to strike a balance between the user 
and the passenger in the seat behind. "It would not be practical to lock seats upright for very short flights of an hour, 
say, when the same aircraft might have to be used for longer flights. A few years back a Washington-based 
company created a stir by coming up with a small device* that passengers could use to lock the seat in front into an 
upright position. According to the company's website this is still available. American considered whether to ban the 
device. In the UK ,the Civil Aviation Authority considered doing likewise. But the US airline says: "If we had seen 
anyone using it we would have stopped them because you can't have passengers interfering with equipment that 
needs safety certification.
*It is called the Knee Defender and according to the company's website is still available.
Q: I am an American who flies through Heathrow on a somewhat regular basis. I either fly in for work or fly through 
in transit. On a number of occasions the immigration officer has scribbled "In Transit" or "In Transit 1" (if I am 
connecting through Terminal 1), and that makes sense. But on one occasion, flying from Paris through Heathrow 
with a 10-hour stopover, the officer wrote "W" and circled it. What does a circled "W" mean on a stamp? Am I now 
on a watch list because I fly through Heathrow often? As far as I know I do not need a visa for work or leisure visits 
and surely I don't need one to change flights.
WF professional photographer, San Francisco
A: The answer appears to lie in the number of times you have entered the UK. I have checked with the Home 
Office, which says that, although travellers making occasional business trips to Britain do not need visas, those 
coming frequently are required to apply for them.
The "W" in your passport is an indication this time you were allowed entry at the discretion of the immigration officer 
and to alert colleagues to this fact next time you come. However, I and the Home Office are surprised that the 
officer failed to explain this to you. You should surely not have been left in doubt and if this is a frequent omission 
by immigration staff, it surely needs to be addressed.

(ANSA) - Treviso, March 27 - Irish low-cost air carrier Ryanair expects its passenger traffic at the Antonio Canova 
airport of Treviso, northern Italy, to exceed 1.45 million in 2008, which would be 100,000 more passengers 
compared to 2007, marketing manager for Italy, Alessia Viviani, said.
The company expects a 40,000 passenger traffic on the Treviso-Malta destination, which was launched a couple of 
months ago, while the number of passengers on the other European and Italian destinations is forecast to increase 
by 12,000.
Currently, Treviso is Ryanair's fourth-biggest Italian airport by number of handled passengers. The leader is the 
Rome Ciampino airport with 3.5 million passengers, followed by Bergamo's Orio al Serio with 3.3 million and Pisa 
with 1.9 million.
To celebrate the third anniversary of its flight between Paris and Treviso, on which the airline has transported some 
400,000 passengers so far, Ryanair will offer three million one-way tickets to all its destinations at 10 euro ($15.81), 
tax included, in April, May and June 2008.

Michael O'Leary, the motormouth boss of Ryanair, is famous for dressing up at press conferences. His most 
notorious guise was as the Pope but yesterday he donned (not literally, unfortunately) a hair shirt.
O'Leary announced that he and 35 other senior executives would forgo a pay increase this year as profits are set to 
dive because of high oil prices.
Not that he will starve on Euros 565,000 a year, excluding bonus and pension.
Still, he is working harder for it. "I am married with two young children under the age of two-and-a-half and have 
discovered for the first time in my life that many of the joys of fatherhood (lead you) to spend more time at the 
office," he said. "The office is more attractive than changing nappies or getting up in the night."
And in spite of saying he will only stick around for another two or three years, it is too early to talk of retirement 
plans.
"Remember, Ryanair is the most fun you can have with your clothes on."
Perhaps not if you are jammed in the back row on the 6.30am to Dublin.

Ryanair Holdings PLC will cut costs and freeze the salaries of its executives in a bid to counter the imminent impact 
of much higher fuel prices, company officials said Wednesday.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said the cash-rich Dublin-based airline still plans to keep expanding across Europe 
this year, but reiterated that he expects 2008 profits to fall up to 50 percent, chiefly because of oil exceeding $100 a 
barrel.
The airline's current contracts delivering fuel at an equivalent cost of $68 a barrel expire at the end of the month. 
The current cost of oil is around $102, and O'Leary says the airline does not plan to sign new price-hedging 
contracts now in hopes that the price will fall.
"We don't plan on hedging at these prices. We will buy on the spot market," O'Leary told reporters.
He said 36 executives, including himself, would be paid at 2007 levels "unless the current high oil prices fall, and 
until we can see some prospect of profits being increased." He said the pay freeze would save the airline about 2 
million euros ($3 million) this year.
In a statement, Ryanair said it was "reviewing all of its major costs, including airports, staffing, fuel and currency 
exposures, and this cost reduction program will continue over the coming weeks."
O'Leary declined to specify whether the airline might trim its 5,000-strong work force or cut underperforming routes, 
but said the airline must reduce costs "in every other area" to compensate for the price of fuel.
Ryanair is Europe's largest budget airline. It operates 645 routes in 26 countries and plans to carry 52 million 
passengers this year.

Low-fares airline Ryanair Holdings PLC will have to make cost savings of around 400 mln eur to compensate for 
higher jet fuel costs as the airline imposed a pay freeze on management.
Michael O'Leary, the airline's chief executive told a press conference in Brussels that Ryanair's current 68 
usd/barrel fuel hedges expire on April 1. With the oil price hovering around the 100 usd/barrel Mark O'Leary said 
the airline was freezing the pay of over 30 of its senior management team for 2008.
'Given the enormous increase in our fuel costs, and the likelihood that profits over the coming year may fall, it is 
appropriate that Ryanair's senior management lead this cost reduction programme by example, with a pay freeze in 
2008,' he said in a statement released after the event.
O'Leary said Ryanair's 2008 fuel bill would rise by about 400 mln eur, and confirmed the airline needs to cut costs 
by the same amount. He added that significant cost cuts were also needed in many areas, and did not rule out 
withdrawing Ryanair flights from certain airports.
'We are working intensively on other cost reductions, including focusing on airport costs and handling costs, staff 
costs and other operating expenses, as we expand Ryanair while lowering fares but absorbing much higher oil 
costs,' O'Leary said.
O'Leary reaffirmed that Ryanair's profit forecast for the year to end-March 2009 ranges from a 5-10 pct rise to a loss 
of 50 pct. He said the forecast would be reviewed at the 2007/8 results presentation, in the first week of June.
In February Ryanair said it was 'essentially unhedged' on fuel for next year, adding that high oil prices would 
impose significantly higher costs for the 2008/09 full year.
Earlier this month, Ryanair's low-cost rival easyJet said its fuel bill in the second half could rise by 45 mln stg if the 
price of jet fuel remains at current unprecedented levels.
The oil price continues to hover above the 100 usd/barrel mark on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Ryanair today said it plans a top-down cost cutting programme as the hedge on its fuel needs expires next week 
and crude futures hover above the USD100 a barrel level.
From 1st April next Ryanair's current USD68 per barrel fuel hedges expire.
Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary told a news conference in Brussels that the airline will freeze the pay of 36 senior 
managers, including himself, and warned that Ryanair would continue to increase the cost of checking in luggage in 
order to encourage passengers to fly with only hand luggage where possible.
 The airline is reviewing all its main costs - including airports, staffing levels and fuel - because of the soaring price 
in oil, but Mr O'Leary would not be drawn on where exactly the cuts would be made. He warned, however, that 
airports which were not able to reduce costs may find themselves losing Ryanair flights, while those who did make 
significant cost reductions would be rewarded with more flights. Mr O'Leary said Ryanair's profits would be badly 
affected by the surge in oil prices, and repeated a warning that next year's profits could fall by as much as 50pc. Mr 
O'Leary launched a scathing attack on the European Commission for its investigations into small airports across 
Europe where Ryanair has been launching operations. The Commission has been checking if Ryanair has been 
enjoying favourable terms from governments and regional authorities which may qualify as illegal state aid at 
airports such as Charleroi in southern Belgium and Bratislava in Slovakia.

European equity markets charged ahead yesterday with banking stocks leading the rally as the continent's bourses 
had their first chance to react to Monday's news that JPMorgan had increased its offer for Bear Stearns.
The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 was 3.2 per cent higher at 1,266.03 as investors backed the financial sector 
across the continent on hopes the move marked the beginning of the end of the subprime crisis.
Stocks that felt the most pain before Easter made the sharpest recoveries. German property lender Hypo Real 
Estate rose 12 per cent to Euros 14.92 in the wake of better home sales data than expected in the US on Monday, 
which raised hopes the US property market may have bottomed out and gave a shot in the arm to lenders in 
Europe.
Anglo Irish Bank was another star performer, up 11.5 per cent at Euros 8.75 after taking a pummelling last week on 
liquidity fears.

The aviation sector was in focus with budget airline Ryanair rising 8.7 per cent to Euros 2.99, as the oil price fell.
Alitalia was up 32.3 per cent to Euros 0.46 on reports that Air France-KLM would extend its talks with labour unions 
over its offer for the Italian carrier.
Debt-laded Telecom Italia advanced 10.6 per cent to Euros 1.34 on hopes that the company was finalising the sale

The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 was 3.2 per cent higher at 1,266.03 as investors backed the financial sector 
across the continent on hopes the move marked the beginning of the end of the subprime crisis.
"The Bear Stearns story has buoyed banking stocks, which have taken a battering over the last week. It's a bit of a 
relief bounce, but the big question is whether these index levels can now be sustained," said Jimmy Yates, head of 
European trading at CMC Markets.
"We're not out of the woods yet. The underlying problems in the credit market haven't gone away," he said.
Stocks that had felt the most pain before Easter made the sharpest recoveries. Hypo Real Estate, the German 
property lender, soared 12 per cent to Euros 14.92 in the wake of better than expected home sales data in the US 
on Monday. The data raised hopes the US property market may have bottomed out and gave a shot in the arm to

Anglo Irish Bank was another star performer, surging 11.5 per cent to Euros 8.75 after taking a pummelling last

Other banks that had been providing grist for the rumour mill also bounced back. Switzerland's two big financial 
stocks shrugged off recent fears of further big writedowns, with UBS rising 8.2 per cent to SFr30.20 and Credit 
Suisse 6.3 per cent higher at SFr51.55.
Germany's Commerzbank gained 8.9 per cent to Euros 18.84 after Credit Suisse upgraded its rating from "neutral" 
to "outperform", saying credit worries had already been substantially priced into the stock, which was better placed 
than that of many banks to weather turmoil in the credit market. Domestic rivalDeutsche Bank rose 4.6 per cent to

of its French unit Alice. The stock hit a 10-year low last week at Euros 1.148 but dealers said confidence in the 
stock was boosted after key shareholders paid Euros 150m to raise their stake in the company on Thursday.

As cyclical stocks moved back into the foreground, defensive stocks lost steam with Belgian brewer InBev down 3.4

News Items In Brief
## Utility group NTR's waste operation Greenstar is planning to build up a 250m euro war chest to fund an 
ambitious foray into the eastern European market. Already active in Ireland, the UK and US, it is negotiating with its 
banks on financing and has amassed a team of managers to prowl around Poland and the Czech Republic for 
targets. "We wouldn't be interested in going into any new market unless we were confident we could get it up to 
200m euro a year in sales within five years," Steve Cowman, Greenstar's chief executive, said yesterday. The 
company aims to buy a large domestic waste company in Poland and the Czech Republic and to build a number of 
recycling plants. - Sunday Times
## AIM listed spread betting company Worldspreads is considering a dual listing which would see its shares traded 
on the Dublins tock market within months. Its chief operating officer Brian O'Neill said that its board has not yet 
taken a final decision but there was a lot of support for the idea among directors. He said he believed a number of 
funds based in Ireland would be more likely to invest in the company if it had a listing on the IEX. - Sunday 
Business Post
 ## Two more new companies to supply services to hedge funds are setting up shop in Dublin. Equinoxe Alternative 
Investment Services is in the final stages of its application to the Financial Regulator and is fitting out offices in 
Malahide. Fulcrum Fund Administration has an office in Ballsbridge and is preparing an application to the regulator.

which is just getting over a highly-public boardroom battle, faces another headache as the founder of its cash 
machines business prepares to bring a new rival to the stock market later this year. Payzone was created out of the 
merger of Irish e-payments firm Alphyra with UK ATM machine operator Cardpoint last December. Mark Mills, the 
businessman who built Cardpoint into one of the largest independent players in the sector in the UK, before being 
NTR plans war chest of 250 m euro
ousted in October 2006, is currently hatching a plan to float another ATM business, to be called Cash, on London's

challenge by easyJet to the stiff price increases recently imposed by Britain's two biggest airports, Heathrow and 
Gatwick. The judicial review of the decision by the Civil Aviation Authority could threaten a planned multi-million 
pound refinancing of BAA, the company that runs the airports. - Sunday Times ## In a direct challenge to the 
dominant position Coolmore enjoys in the Australian bloodstock industry, Sheikh Mohammed has paid a reputed 
dollar 400m to acquire the bloodstock operations of Inghams Enterprises. The acquisition has caused a stir in the 
Australian racing industry and upped the ante for John Magnier's Coolmore, the most successful bloodstock 
operation in Australia, reawakening memories of the intense rivalry between the two bloodstock giants. - Irish

bank's third foray into specialist finance, following last year's launch of its Springboard sub-prime business with 
Merrill Lynch and personal loan consolidator Blue Cube. Earlier this year it invited Seniors Money and two 
competitors - Sixty Plus Finance and Finance Ireland - to pitch for the business, according to a source involved in 
the process. - Sunday Tribune

EasyJet PLC has remained silent about a report claiming it plans to challenge a decision to increase landing fees at 
some of BAA's London airports.
'I cannot give you any kind of comment about that because it's pure speculation,' a spokesman for the Luton-based 
no-frills carrier said.
The Sunday Times said easyJet plans to request a judicial review of the Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA) decision to 
allow BAA, owned by Spanish construction company Grupo Ferrovial SA, to increase landing charges at Heathrow 
and Gatwick airports in the next five years.
The CAA said the rises would allow the operator to invest in facilities and improve its service. BAA said the increase 
was inadequate.
EasyJet has retained London law firm Lane & Partners as its adviser and informed the CAA and BAA nine days ago 
of its move to seek a review, The Sunday Times said.
It is expected to formalise a claim to the High Court within a month, the newspaper said. If the court accepts it has a 
case, arguments could take another six months, with a decision possible by the end of the year, the newspaper 
cited legal sources as saying.
Rival no-frills carrier Ryanair Holdings said yesterday it would join the action and privately owned BMI is also 
expected to take part, The Sunday Times said. Virgin Atlantic is undecided and British Airways PLC is unlikely to 
participate, the newspaper said.

Ethical funds across the world are showing an interesting sense of right an wrong in their dealings with firms that 
are the focus of intense public criticism.
What do the words 'ethical investment' bring to mind? A portfolio containing names specialising in green 
technology? Companies of the squeaky clean variety? Corporations that engage in fair trade practices?
What everone's image, one certainly doesn't think of companies like McDonalds when one imagines an ethical 
portfolio. You don't think of oil behemoths like Shell or BP. You don't think of uranium miners. And you most 
definitely don't think of tobacco manufacturers.
Think again. You'll find them all - and many more - in many an 'ethical' portfolio.
The whole question of standards in the arena of socially responsible funds (SRIs) has been attracting debate in 
Britain, after a recent report found that most funds are ''surprisingly mainstream'' in their choice of companies.
The report noted that, out of 58 funds that were put under the microscope, only one had more than 50 per cent of its 
portfolio in environmental stocks.
For the most part, most funds were populated by the major high street banks and by technology companies like 
Microsoft. Mining groups, companies involved in oil exploration, airline stocks and fast food giants were also far 
from uncommon. Indeed, one fund - the Aberdeen Ethical Engagement Fund - included among its top holdings 
what looked like a Who's Who list of companies targeted by protesters (for example, oil firms Shell and BP, uranium 
miner Rio Tinto and - bizarrely - British American Tobacco).
The Irish situation appears to be no different. Only one fund - Dolmen's Green Effects fund - is of the 'hard green' 
variety, populated as it is by wind turbine manufacturers, wholesalers of organic foods and natural products, solar 
power plants operators and others of this ilk.
Ethical portfolios flex their morals
The others are a pretty mainstream bunch. New Ireland's Ethical Managed Fund, for example, contains the usual 
Irish banks, as well as CRH and Ryanair. Many advocates of ethical investing believe that airline stocks in general 
have no place in SRI portfolios, due to their obvious environmental impact.
Ryanair, in particular, has raised the ire of many critics. British minister Ian Pearson dubbed the firm ''the 
irresponsible face of capitalism'' in 2007.Nor is it just on the environmental front that Ryanair has faced criticism. Its 
treatment of disabled passengers has attracted attention on many occasions, such as forcing customers to pay  18 
for the use of a wheelchair.
Ryanair has also been maligned for its trade union policies, hidden charges and alleged misleading advertising.
Bank of Ireland's inclusion might also raise some eyebrows. In 2004, it was embroiled in controversy, when it 
emerged that it had provided loans to Remnant Media for the purchase of a portfolio of pornographic magazines 
that included names like Horny Housewives, Mega Boobs and Asian Babes. ''We don't moralise," a spokesperson 
told the Irish Examiner at the time.
Unfortunately for the bank, others do, and it was forced to apologise to customers after a media furore erupted.
The inclusion of such names is no surprise to American environmental campaigner Paul Hawken. Hawken has long 
been a critic of the SRI industry, writing in 2004 that the industry had ''no standards, no definitions and no 
regulations, other than financial regulations''. Hawken's wrath was particularly directed at funds whose ''Orwellian 
logic'' dictated that McDonalds be included in its portfolios for its progressive waste management practices.
What's so wrong with McDonald's? For starters, its business model, which is to ''entice and lure children with 
clowns, toys, and advertisements into a lifetime of junk food consisting of burgers, fries,Coke, and food additives'', 
causes ''obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes''.
Add in the firm's ''union-busting activities'', the fact that the ''vast majority'' of its workers ''do not have any benefits'' 
and the ''untold damage'' it has done to US agriculture by ''forcing down costs'', and it becomes clear that Hawken 
will not be scooping up McDonald's shares anytime soon. ''If the business model is corrupt, then it hardly matters if 
a company uses recycled paper or provides daycare."
Hawken's critics counter that they ''do not look for the best; we look for the better'', to quote Amy Domini, founder of 
Domini Social Funds and co-founder of the US-based Domini 400 Social Index.
Domini has written that McDonalds should be praised for its ''impressive record of responsiveness to our concerns'', 
and that the ethical industry is not about ''applying eco-fundamentalism to investments''.
Rather, ''we are entering the belly of the beast of the financial/corporate juggernaut and we are shaping it''.
Domini's inclusive 'best in class' approach mirrors the position taken by the creators of the FTS&EURO;4Good 
index, Britain's version of the Domini 400. Spokesmen have said that its purpose is not to contain ''squeaky clean 
companies'', but to ''encourage progress toward greater corporate social responsibility in the business world''. True 
to its word, 2006 saw the FTS&EURO;4Good policy committee declare its ''ongoing commitment to remove the 
negative screens currently employed. . . and replace them with appropriate entry criteria'', paving the way for the 
inclusion of controversial global mining giant RioTinto in 2007.
Hawken told this paper that he's not impressed by such gradualist arguments. " 'For the good of what?' might be the 
question to ask the FTS&EURO;4Good maker." While ethical fund managers have long protested that financial 
returns need not be sacrificed, it's unarguable that funds that restrict themselves to a small supply of companies are 
likely to experience greater volatility and, very possibly, poorer returns. Hawken sees performance concerns as 
being the ''primary driver'' of loose screening practices.
''As SRI funds attract more institutional money, they are subject to 'prudent man' rule scrutiny. They are doing 
everything they can to be acceptable to the broadest possible clientele, and with that, has come dilution of meaning 
and standards, and an emphasis on comparable returns."
Ethical portfolios flex their morals
It's a far cry from the early days of the movement. While religious groups like the Quakers raised concerns over 
unethical investments as far back as the 18th century, the world's first SRI fund was not seen until the launch of the 
PaxWorld Fund in the US in 1971.Publication in 1972 of the famous photograph of a naked and screaming 
Vietnamese child as she ran from a napalm attack on her village, her back on fire, galvanised support for ethical 
advocates, with napalm producer Dow Chemical becoming the first high-profile company to be targeted by 
demonstrators.
The apartheid regime in South Africa was shunned by investors in the 1970s and 1980s, leading Nelson Mandela to 
credit the SRI industry for its role in dismantling the system.
In 1984, the Friends Provident Stewardship Unit Trust became the Britain's first ethical fund. Widely-derided at the 
time, the fund was christened Brazil by derisive city analysts, the reason being that it was only for 'nuts'.
What's clear is that it's a big mistake to think of the ethical industry as some kind of idealistic monolith. Ethical funds 
are big business today, with the industry controlling over $2 trillion world wide. There are over 90 different funds in 
Britain alone, where a recent survey revealed that 85 per cent of investors would consider ethical funds when 
looking for a suitable venue to park their money.
Like their British counterparts, Irish SRI funds are, for the most part, a middle-of-the-road bunch. Unfortunately, 
detail is lacking on the websites of many of the main providers.
The popular picture of a typical ethical fund is very much at odds with the reality. Unless investors have really done 
their homework, it's likely that many have bought into funds whose definition of ethical corporate behaviour is 
somewhat more elastic than their own.

The medieval magic of Malta

It may not be considered a winter hot spot, but Malta still has enough off-season sunshine to turn this 
Mediterranean island into a glorious baroque experience, writes Dick O'Riordan.
I chose Malta for reasons other than its reputation of being, pound-for-pound, the best treasure trove of historical 
and cultural artefacts in all of the Mediterranean.
My reasons were shamelessly philistine. I snapped up two rock-bottom Ryanair tickets and set out to prove an old 
theory of mine that Malta - considered an iffy winter destination for so long - had enough off-peak sunshine to justify 
fleeing there from famishing February and the chill bills from An Bord Gáis.
Malta is, after all, a sort of tail-end archipelago close to the coast of north Africa and, despite the ice cap meltdown, 
there doesn't appear to be any distress signals about climate change from Colonel Gaddafi. You may be taking 
your chances, but Malta just has to be warmer than Ireland.
And it is. Ten days of pleasant sunshine out of ten ain't bad. A bit of wind here and there, perhaps, and a few 
clouds. And so what if the locals were still in shock over recently having had their coldest day in 20 years? It may be 
dicing with the trade descriptions act to declare Malta a wintersun destination but a 'sunny destination in winter' 
would be sound enough.
The islands - a mere half-hour ferry crossing links Malta to its sister island Gozo, an emerald gem in the sun - were 
warming up in a different way when we landed. Hot air hung over Valletta as a general election worked up a head of 
steam and political foes savaged each other with gusto. Legal actions were the order of the day. Happily, one thing 
the warring factions agreed on was a tourism boom, with visitor numbers soaring to unprecedented levels as 
newspapers reported on yet more budget airlines opening connecting services.
You cannot but be immediately captivated by Malta's capital city of Valletta, with its stunning twin harbours - some 
say that it rivals Venice - full of luxury yachts and billowing sails, and its massive medieval walls. It is a baroque 
masterpiece in its entirety, even if some areas are a tad untidy and dishevelled.
The medieval magic of Malta
Italianate bay windows are the dominant architectural feature, and the effect of side-streets plunging carelessly 
down to the sea is simply breathtaking. The city is built on a grid system of three main parallel avenues dissected 
by cross streets. The Knights of St John, remaindered from the Crusades, were master planners and they dominate 
the story of the islands up to the present day.
Malta is a small nation with a big story to tell. You can keep up to speed on its centuries of invasions and sieges 
and bombardments in the many books, films and exhibitions on offer in Valletta.
The Phoenicians were here, as were the Semites, Roman, Ottomans, Normans, French, Italians and countless 
other cultures. The islands were the last stepping stones between the religious tectonic plates of the Muslim and 
Christian worlds.
Ulysses was famously shipwrecked here but, more significantly, so too was Paul of Tarsus, who converted the 
natives to Christianity. The church named after him is popularly known as the Shipwreck Church. History oozes 
from every pore of its honey-coloured limestone walls, luring tourists into yet another gorgeous palazzo, ornate 
church or absorbing museum. A single day in the walled city and you'll be a prisoner of the Knights and all their 
pomp.
Better to sit with a guide for another of Malta's traditions - a long and lingering lunch in one of many splendid 
restaurants - and let her help you avoid cultural overdose by delivering history in bite-sized pieces. Our guide, 
Marriella, was so passionate about medieval Malta that she even criticised the History Channel for screening too 
many programmes about World War II - a conflict in which the is land was awarded the George Cross for heroically 
resisting Mussolini's two-year bombing blitz. More than 40,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed.
A present-day reminder is the stumps of the pillars of the once-glorious opera house - the authorities are still trying 
to decide what to do with it. The population was reduced to starvation, an experience which may have influenced 
the over-generous portions now served in restaurants.
''Our story is everywhere," says Marriella with pride. ''Even in this room. There is big history and little history. A 
contessa supervised the building of her church from that balcony window, in the 18th century."
Church building was a tradition of the time, with wealthy families investing fortunes in God's infrastructure plans. 
Today, Malta claims to have a church or cathedral for every day of the year, and massive domes, spires and 
belfries spike the wide horizons no matter in which direction you travel.
Another palace that embraces both past and present is the Casa Rocca Piccola, a 16th-century palazzo on 
Republic Street. This is, in reality, a mini-mansion where the same aristocratic family has resided for generations. 
The 9thMarquis de Piro did the honours of showing our group around.
A gentleman full of humour and self-deprecation, he pointed out quirky details here and there about long-gone 
forebears who looked down disapprovingly from the walls. The Marquis was particularly proud of the family's 
precious collections. ''Grandmother's last words before she died were: 'Do not break up my silver collection'. So we 
dare not."
Of more recent memory were his parents' portrait at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth which had a prominent 
place on the picture-packed walls - unlike a full-frontal naked lady hung out of sight behind a door.
Valletta is a rambler's city with lots to discover. Nobody can afford to miss its greatest treasure, the Co-Cathedral of 
St John, an astonishing tribute by the Knights to themselves, which has been described as the most ostentatious 
church in all of Christiandom.
It also houses Caravaggio's chilling masterpiece, The Beheading of John the Baptist. It is the only signed 
Caravaggio in existence, with his name written in the blood.
A palace of more recent origin nearby was our temporary, though not-so-humble, abode. The Excelsior Grand Hotel 
claims to be one of the most prestigious lodgings in Malta. It has taken ten years to complete and stands proudly 
The medieval magic of Malta
overlooking the harbour, its opulent facilities stretching down from The Great Siege Road underneath the enormous 
walls to the edge of the Mediterranean.
An unwelcome guest had a miserable time about here in the mid-16th century. Suleiman the Magnificent launched 
his sieges against the gallant knights and was driven back on both occasions.
After the first siege in 1565 the knights build their fortress city, realising that Suleiman, while indeed magnificent, 
was never magnanimous.
He came back with 40,000 troops, and the siege was so ferocious that the defenders trampled for weeks on the 
bodies of their own men, women and children because they had no time to clean up the carnage between assaults.
Another siege that left its mark on Valletta was that by the Irish during our famous World Cu p campaign in 1990. 
Many of Jack's Army were ''billeted'' on Malta and delivered there and back to nearby Sicily for the matches. 
Veterans of the Irish invasion still talk of the greening of Valletta and the celebrations that lasted long after Schillaci 
snuffed us out.
''We were laughing then, but we haven't laughed much since," pined an invasion veteran we met in Luciano 
Cottino's restaurant. Luciano's was the epicentre of the Irish occupation, and its thousand crooked pictures seem to 
indicate the place is still recovering from the experience.
Buses in Maltamay not be plush - many look like the old CIE single-deckers - but they are plentiful, clean and 
cheap, and provide great sight-seeing opportunities, such as to the famous silent city of Mdina - the old capital - 
about ten kilometres away, or to the picturesque seaside resort of Marsaxlokk Bay down the coast. They also 
provide transport to the many restaurants and nightclubs in the adjoining suburban areas of Sliema and St Julian's, 
or even to the ferry for Gozo, an island also well worth a prolonged stay.
And not to worry: the lira may be past tense, but Malta's red phone kiosks, souvenirs of British imperialism, have 
survived. I achieved a lifetime's ambition and phoned home from one - but failed to get through. The British empire 
ain't wot it used to be.
Getting there
How to get there: Ryanair has flights three days a week from Dublin: Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Tour 
operators organise package holidays, mostly from May to September.
Where to stay: Malta has a strong hotel infrastructure with reliable star gradings. There are two five-star hotels in 
Valletta and many more top quality hotels in coastal areas around the city, such as Sliema and St Julian's Bay. 
These are a 50-cent bus journey from Valletta and provide good accommodation value off-season. Hotels have 
invested heavily in luxurious spa and leisure centres.
What it costs: two days half-board (breakfast and dinner) in the new five-star Excelsior Palace on Valletta harbour 
costs  360. Three days H/B for two in the five-star Corinthia Palace Hotel - which has a stunningly dining room and 
black-tie waiter service - costs  340 for two. The five-star Kempinski St Laurenz hotel on Gozo has enormous rooms 
and specialises in organic cuisine. Two days H/B costs  320 for two; a real must-go-back experience. All hotels had 
exceptional spas and health centres. Four-star hotels cost much less in off-season, but do not always have indoor 
pools, an essential in variable weather.
When to go: any time, depending on what level of sunshine you seek. Peak season is June to September, when 
family holidays pack out coastal resorts.
Time difference: one hour ahead.
Currency: euro. Maltese lira are being phased out
Electricity: three-prong plugs, as in Ireland.
The medieval magic of Malta
What to bring: during off-season, light layers and a decent warm rain jacket or fleece for nights. Leading hotels 
insist on jacket and/ or tie.
What to buy: shoes, jewellery, honey and sculpture (on Gozo).
Car hire: choice of local and international companies. Five days hire of Peugeot 206 cost  120 (all risks waiver 
included).
What to avoid: driving a hired car back to Luqa airport which is seven kilometres from Valletta. The signs are small 
and confusing, and the traffic can be heavy. Take a taxi.

Six people were slightly injured when an aircraft operated by Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC skidded off 
a runway as it landed in heavy rain in the French city of Limoges, officials and the airline said.
A regional government official said 186 passengers and crew were on board when the Boeing 737 overshot the end 
of the runway by 40 metres on Friday.
In a statement, Ryanair said everyone on board left the plan safely using its emergency inflatable slides and that a 
pregnant passenger had been taken for a check-up.
'At the time of landing it was raining. The runway was wet and exposed to strong winds, although within normal 
safety parameters,' the airline said.
The plane had flown in from Charleroi in Belgium and most of the passengers were Belgian. Two of those hurt 
needed treatment in the university hospital in Limoges, a city in central France, officials said.
Jean-Pierre Limousin, chairman of the chamber of commerce that manages Limoges airport, said: 'A build-up of 
rain water on the runway seems to have caused the aircraft to slide on the slick tarmac.'

Ireland's stock market surged in the final hour of trading Thursday after regulators unveiled a probe into rumor-
spreading designed to drive down certain stocks' value.
Investors immediately snapped up shares in companies, particularly banks, that had fallen especially heavily in 
recent days. The Irish Stock Exchange closed up 5.5 percent.
The biggest risers were biopharmaceutical company Elan Corp., up 19 percent to €14.85 (US$22.95); Anglo Irish 
Bank Corp., up 8.4 percent to €7.48 (US$11.60); Ryanair, up 7.8 percent to €2.75 (US$4.25); Allied Irish Banks, up 
6.8 percent to €13.45 (US$12.80); and Bank of Ireland, up 6.2 percent to €9.50 (US$14.70).
The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority said it had begun to investigate "unusual trading patterns in Irish 
shares" that appeared connected to "false and misleading rumors circulating in financial markets."
A senior regulatory official, Con Horan, said his investigators were trying to identify "market participants who take 
unfair advantage by spreading false rumors while trading on the basis of those rumors."
It was the final day of trading in Dublin until Tuesday. Good Friday and Easter Monday are national holidays in 
Ireland.
John Hurley, governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, welcomed the regulator's move, which mirrors similar 
investigations being carried out in neighboring Britain into whether malicious rumor-mongering has been designed 
to drive down the share values of certain British banks, particularly Halifax Bank of Scotland.
Hurley said it had made no sense to see Irish banks' shares fall so heavily in recent days.
"As I have outlined in recent statements, the Irish banking sector remains robust and has no material exposures to 
the subprime market," said Hurley, referring to the high-risk investment vehicles that have hit the profits of many 
U.S. banks.

Ireland's stock market is unusually weighted in favor of banks and other financial companies. The index has lost

The ISEQ index held on to low positive numbers in morning trade today after some of the most volatile trading in its 
history but with Anglo Irish and CRH both holding the index back.
By midday, the ISEQ was up 9.38 points to 5,849.06.
Irish investors were keeping a wary on on news from the UK today after the UK's financial watchdog, the FSA, is 
looking in to whether rumours about the liquidity and solvency of top UK banks have been deliberately spread to 
undermine the value of bank shares. It said it would "not tolerate" traders starting "false" rumours about firms to 
make cash from dealing in their shares. HBOS, whose shares fell as much as 17pc at one stage on Wednesday, 
denied rumours of funding difficulties.
 Meanwhile, the heads of Britain's major banks are to meet today with Bank of England governor Mervyn King. 
They are expected to seek reassurance that the central bank will intervene in the financial market if help is required. 
Dublin bank shares put in a decidedly mixed early performance with Anglo Irish once again falling. The banks, 
which have plummeted between 50pc and almost 70pc from their highs of last year, have been caught between a 
property market slowdown, which is impacting the broader economy, and higher funding costs as a result of the 
credit crunch. The influential Lex column in the Financial Times on Monday appeared to rattle market sentiment 
towards Anglo Irish as it poured negative comments on banks with large exposure to property investments. It was 
enough to send Anglo's stock down as much as 22pc in Monday's market, with its shares now down 38pc since 
Christmas. Anglo's shares fell by 5c to E6.85. Elsewhere in the sector, AIB shares climbed 34c to E12.94, Bank of 
Ireland was up 16c to E9.11 and Irish Life and Permanent gained 19c to E11.09. CRH also weighed on the index 
following a report yesterday from the US showing a market drop in new contracts in the non-residential building 
sector in a market where the Irish group derives over 50pc of its group revenues. Shares in the firm slumped by 54c 
to E23.36. Shares in cardboard packaging giant, Smurfit Kappa fell by 12c to E7.48, on top of a slump in the shares

on Wednesday of some 6pc this week with the stock is now at its lowest point since it joined the market over a year

implies a share price of 1200c-over 50pc above current levels," said Davy Research. Shares in Ryanair, which have 
fallen steadily since its latest warning to the markets on profits and margins, rose by 18c to E2.73 despite a gloomy 
broker's analysis of prospects for next year. For the third time in just three months, Goodbody Stockbrokers is 
cutting Ryanair's full-year 2009 profit forecast, citing surging oil prices and weak Sterling. Worries about consumer 
demand in a declining economy and EasyJet's warning on profits yesterday contributed to the down-grading. 
Analyst, Joe Gill, said that, with Ryanair's fuel hedge expiring on April 1, it is exposed to a sharp margin 
compression in its new financial year as oil prices stay well above the USD100 a barrel mark and hit USD110 just a 
week ago. Shares in bathroom fittings maker, Qualceram Shires edged up 2c to E1.00 after it said it has received a 
takeover approach. The Arklow, Co Wicklow, firm, said it had received "an unsolicited preliminary expression of 
interest from a third party".

For the third time in just three months, Goodbody Stockbrokers is cutting Ryanair's full-year 2009 profit forecast, 
citing surging oil prices and weak Sterling.
Worries about consumer demand in a declining economy and EasyJet's warning on profits yesterday contributed to 
the down-grading.
Analyst, Joe Gill, said that, with Ryanair's fuel hedge expiring on April 1, it is exposed to a sharp margin 
compression in its new financial year as oil prices stay well above the USD100 a barrel mark and hit USD110 just a 
week ago.
 Assuming jet fuel stays at USD1000 per ton for 2009, "while our per passenger revenue assumption remains 
largely unchanged (+2.2pc year on year), our earnings per share forecast falls to 16c from 25.7c, implying a 48pc 
fall year-on-year. Core profit (EBITDA) margins will drop from 13.2pc to 8.4pc, while passenger volume continues to 
grow at a pace of approximately 19pc," he said. "While this profit decline is dramatic, it should be judged against 
how the airline industry normally behaves during a cost/revenue crisis. Heavy losses are incurred and weaker 
carriers disappear. Our new forecast implies Ryanair stays profitable at a time when oil prices are at record highs 
and consumer sentiment is weak," Mr Gill said.

European equity markets ended down after a volatile session yesterday led by falls in telecommunications shares 
and airlines.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended 0.9 per cent lower at 1,230.28, paring gains made shortly after the US open.
Telecoms stocks were hit by fears that a consumer slowdown would hurt fixed-line and mobile businesses. At the 
same time, the European Union reiterated it would push for more competition and reduced tariffs.
The telecoms equipment maker Ericsson 's B-shares tumbled 7.8 per cent to SKr10.59 after its mobile handset joint 
venture Sony Ericsson warned first-half earnings could fall by up to half as a global consumer slowdown dents 
demand.
The sector leader Nokia of Finland fell 5.9 per cent to Euros 19.25, while France's Alcatel-Lucent shed 3 per cent to 
Euros 3.28.
Telecom Italia , the debt-laden phone operator, fell 6.2 per cent to Euros 0.96 on rumours of a capital increase to 
fund restructuring and other efforts to combat declining earnings.
Meanwhile, a weak outlook at Deutsche Telekom drove the German operator's shares down 6.9 per cent to Euros 
10.59. The company said it aimed to stabilise its fixed- line business by 2010.
Airline stocks were hit by a profit warning at EasyJet. The British budget carrier said record fuel costs would dent 
full-year profits if oil prices did not fall soon.
Its Irish rival Ryanair plunged 7.9 per cent to Euros 2.55, while the German no-frills group Air Berlin fell 6.9 per cent 
to Euros 7.15.
In the beleaguered banking sector, stocks managed to deflect rumours of impending disaster that circulated in early 
trade. Meanwhile, some confidence in the sector was restored by Morgan Stanley, which reported better-
thanexpected quarterly earnings.
Telecoms fall on worries about slowdown
UBS , whose shares have also fallen foul of the rumour mill, recovered from early losses. The stock, which initially 
fell 2.5 per cent, ended 0.7 per cent higher at SFr28.22.
"Much of the rumour is probably unfounded supposition and speculation, but with panic still gripping the markets, 
investors seem to be attaching more credence to the scaremongers than would be the case in more stable times," 
said Martin Slaney at GFT Global Markets.
Anglo Irish Bank , which plunged almost 25 per cent in the first two days of the week, failed to claw its way back into 
positive territory, falling another 3.6 per cent to Euros 6.65 as talk of liquidity problems persisted.
In France BNP Paribas rallied 4.7 per cent to Euros 60.76 after saying it did not intend bidding for its rival Societe 
Generale . SocGen shares were down 7.1 per cent to Euros 62.44.
Credit Suisse climbed 3.9 per cent to SFr51.80 after Morgan Stanley added the stock as a "long" in its financials 
best ideas portfolio. The broker said strong free cash flow at its wealth management business was the main 
attraction.
Carmakers put in a strong showing after Fitch Ratings said that top German automotive suppliers are in a 
comparably good position to deal with the tough trading conditions of the auto supply industry "thanks to 
technological strengths, enlarged global reach and robust profitability".
BMW rose 3.4 per cent to Euros 33.75, while Volkswagen advanced 3 per cent to Euros 181.13, and Daimler 
gained 0.7 per cent to Euros 53.04.
At the same time Continental , the German auto parts supplier, climbed 2.2 per cent to Euros 56.14 and France's 
Renault drove forward 2.7 per cent to Euros 64.39.
However, Fitch warned that the credit profiles of the companies would continue to diverge.

Oil price triggers EasyJet profit warning

EasyJet shares declined sharply yesterday as the UK low-cost airline issued a profits warning under pressure from 
the surging oil price. The group said if oil prices continued to rise at the present rate, pre-tax profits for the full year 
to the end of September would be below its previous guidance. The share price closed 35 3/4p, or 9.5 per cent, 
lower at 339 1/4p after falling as much as 18 per cent in early trading.
Andy Harrison, EasyJet chief executive, said the airline's results in the first half to the end of March would be "in line 
with our expectations". However, it was "pretty obvious that if the recent significant rise in the fuel price is 
maintained, then our second-half profits will be lower than we had previously expected".
If the fuel price remained at the current level, the airline was facing extra costs of about Pounds 45m in the second 
half, in spite of having 40 per cent of its fuel requirements hedged at Dollars 750 a tonne. In the six weeks since its 
last trading statement in early February, EasyJet said the forward price for jet fuel for summer delivery had risen 
from Dollars 840 a tonne to more than Dollars 1,000 a tonne.
The airline said it would be unable in the short term to offset such a large and immediate increase by actions to 
improve revenues and cut other costs.
In early February EasyJet had maintained its forecast for a 20 per cent increase in underlying pre-tax profits to 
Pounds 230m in its financial year to the end of September, in stark contrast to the profit warning issued days earlier 
by its rival Ryanair for the coming year. The Irish carrier, Europe's largest no-frills airlineby passenger numbers, 
warned that higher oil prices, weakening consumer sentiment and the strong risk of recession could lead to a sharp 
decline in its profits in the year to March 2009 - possibly by as much as 50 per cent.
This month British Airways also warned that its profits could fall by more than a quarter in the next financial year as 
a result of the surge in oil prices and the economic slowdown. BA told investors it expected its operating profit 
margin to fall to about 7 per cent in the year to the end of March 2009, from a record 10 per cent this year.
Oil price triggers EasyJet profit warning
EasyJet said its revenues had continued to perform well in February and it had filled more seats than a year earlier. 
The positive outlook for its total revenues per seat in the second half was unchanged, but the unprecedented level 
of the fuel price meant it would incur a significant increase in costs.
In a research note ABN Amro said there was no shortage of opportunities for EasyJet and Ryanair in Eur-ope, 
given the cautious stance of the network airlines towards short-haul operations and the focus of charter airlines on 
medium and long-haul travel.
The bank said the retreat of Italy's Alitalia from Milan Malpensa airport offered a chance for expansion to low-cost 
rivals.

EU Court: Ryanair can exercise its voting rights in running of rival Aer Lingus
EU Court: Ryanair can exercise its voting rights in running of rival Aer 
Lingus

A European Court on Wednesday ruled that budget airline Ryanair can exercise its substantial voting rights in 
takeover target Aer Lingus.
The European Union's second-highest court overturned the Irish airline's request that Ryanair's rights be frozen 
while it decides on another case involving the rival airlines. In that case, Aer Lingus claims EU regulators should 
order Ryanair to sell its Aer Lingus shares because it did not win antitrust approval for its hostile takeover bid last 
year.
Ryanair holds a 29.4 percent stake in Aer Lingus and is appealing separately to the same court in an effort to 
overturn the European Commission's decision last year to forbid the takeover.
Antitrust regulators have blocked the deal combining the two Irish airlines, saying it would kill off competition on 
some routes and leave customers open to price increases.
But this left Aer Lingus with rival Ryanair as a major shareholder that is currently unable to launch a hostile bid.
In an attempt to shake off Ryanair, Aer Lingus is asking the court whether Ryanair can be ordered to sell off its 
shares. While waiting for that ruling, it wanted to stop Ryanair using its voting power.
But the Court of First Instance said Wednesday the airline did not fulfill conditions required for an interim ban on 
Ryanair using its voting rights.
"The assertions by Aer Lingus that Ryanair can use its shareholding to cause serious and irreparable harm to Aer 
Lingus are largely hypothetical and unsubstantiated statements," the court said in a statement.
Ryanair welcomed the decision and said the case was an attempt by Aer Lingus "to deflect from the fact that their 
fares and fuel surcharges continue to increase."
Ryanair said its lack of influence over Aer Lingus has been highlighted by two separate refusals by the Aer Lingus 
board to hold an extraordinary general meeting at the request of Ryanair.
EU Court: Ryanair can exercise its voting rights in running of rival Aer Lingus
Ryanair wanted to use the meetings to allow shareholders to consider reversing a controversial Aer Lingus plan to 
shift its flights from London's Heathrow Airport to a new hub in the British territory of Northern Ireland, away from 
Ireland's major western airport, Shannon once an important refueling stop for trans-Atlantic flights.
Aer Lingus had no immediate comment on the ruling, saying it was "reviewing its content."
In a lawsuit filed in November, Aer Lingus separately asked the court to rule that the European Commission, the 
executive arm of the 27-member EU, has the power to order Ryanair to sell its holding in Aer Lingus.
The commission previously said it cannot do this under existing competition law. It said that Ryanair only had a 
minority shareholding, which did not permit it to exercise control over Aer Lingus.
Ryanair, Europe's no-frills leader, became the top shareholder in Aer Lingus after the Irish government privatized 
the previously state-owned airline in 2006.
But Ryanair's attempts to seize its Irish competitor failed because key shareholders chiefly the government and 
employee-controlled trusts oppose Ryanair and have ensured that the airline does not reach the minimum 50 
percent holding for a takeover.
EU competition authorities further undermined Ryanair's ambitions, ruling last year that a combined Aer-Lingus-
Ryanair operation would create an Irish monopoly.

A Dutch court in The Hague has rejected claims by various airports and airlines that flight taxes proposed by the 
Dutch government breach European law and contradict international aviation agreements signed by the 
Netherlands.
The ruling paves the way for the introduction of an environmental tax on airline tickets of 11.25 eur per flight for 
European destinations of less than 2,500 km and 45 eur for longer flights, proposed by the Dutch government last 
year.
The case was brought by Amsterdam airport Schiphol Group, Dutch travel bureau association ANVR, the Board of 
Airline Representatives in the Netherlands (Barin), Ryanair Holdings PLC and Maastricht Aachen Airport.
The Dutch Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transport said earlier this month they are examining the 
possibility of adjusting flight taxes to suit the length of a flight and the type of aircraft used, according to media 
reports.

Irish shares have this morning followed London sharply lower on talk of another UK bank in trouble.
The rumours dispelled much of the market optimism of yesterday, ahead of last night's rate cut by the US fed.
And, even though bank shares here seem to have steadied up after a denial by the Bank of England of the 
rumours, the negative mood has persisted in the market overall.
 The ISEQ index of Irish shares was 107.44 points lower shortly before noon at 5,790.67. Anglo Irish Bank was 
down by 31c as noon approached to 659, but AIB was uncganged at 1250, Irish Life and Permanent was up 5c at 
1061 down and Bank of Ireland had gained 10c to 895. Insurer FBD was down badly, however, with a slide of 32c 
to 1840, having been 110c lower earlier on. Other shares also took a heavy hit, sending the ISEQ index 82.5 points 
lower by late morning to 5,815.61. CRH was down 69c to 2406 and Irish Continental Group sank 104c to 2366. A 
profit warning from easyJet sent Ryanair 24c lower to 253, with Aer Lingus dropping 4c rio 203. Smurfit Kappa

The Irish flag carrier had requested the injunction as part of its efforts to compel Ryanair to sell its minority stake.
The European Commission had already confirmed that since Ryanair has neither de facto nor de jure control over 
Aer Lingus, there are no legal grounds for such a compulsory disposal.
 A Ryanair spokesman said the company would continue to push for the EU's ban on a merger with Aer Lingus to

CAA calls for airport pricing system to put passengers first
CAA calls for airport pricing system to put passengers first

Body
The Civil Aviation Authority, the economic regulator for the three leading London airports, is urging reform of the 
system for setting price controls at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted to put the interests of passengers first.
Harry Bush, CAA director of economic regulation, said: "The regulatory regime could be improved by placing the 
interests of consumers unambiguously at the heart of the CAA's duties and by encouraging competition between 
airports and between airlines for their business."
At the moment, the pricing regime must seek to reflect the often conflicting interests of airlines, airport operators 
and passengers.
But in a clear warning to airlines angered by the scale of price increases at Heathrow and Gatwick, Mr Bush said it 
was "clear that regulatory reform is no magic bullet - airport investments and service quality will still need to be paid 
for".
The CAA call for reform comes as it has fallen under heavy attack from leading airlines for what they claim is its 
failure to regulate effectively the monopoly that BAA, the airports operator owned by Ferrovial of Spain, holds over 
London's airports.
The attacks intensified last week as the CAA announced a big increase in the charges BAA, the airport operator, 
can set for the next five years at Heathrow and Gatwick, and just as the Pounds 4.3bn Terminal Five at Heathrow is 
due to start operations.
Leaders of four of the largest airlines operating from the UK, BMI British Midland, EasyJet, Ryanair and Virgin 
Atlantic, are due to meet Ruth Kelly, transport secretary, today to press for reform.
They joined forces last week to demand a complete overhaul of the regulatory system, a break-up of the BAA 
London monopoly and government intervention to resolve the CAA's failings and impose a moratorium on price 
increases.
CAA calls for airport pricing system to put passengers first
The CAA has already submitted a report, due to be published today, to the Competition Commission putting forward 
the case for reform, but also stressing the necessity for higher charges to pay for increased investment and higher 
service standards.
The submission to the Commission, made as part of the competition authority's investigation into the structure of 
BAA, says there is a "clear case" for regulatory reform, given that the framework has remained largely unchanged 
for 20 years since the privatisation of BAA in the 1980s.

Guinness is the favourite Irish brand in Britain, according to new research that highlights the popularity of Irish 
exports, including alcohol and music.
In research conducted by YouGov ahead of St Patrick's Day for Eulogy, an Irish-owned public relations firm in 
London, 2,162 British adults were asked to pick their favourite Irish product from a given list. Guinness and Baileys 
topped the list with 17 and 16 per cent respectively, while Westlife (10 per cent) edged out U2 (9 per cent).
The fifth most popular Irish brand among British consumers was C&C's Magners cider, which was selected by 6 per 
cent of respondents, with Jameson Irish whiskey close behind on 5 per cent.
Budget airline Ryanair, Kerrygold butter and the recently-reformed boyband Boyzone were all in joint seventh place 
with 3 per cent. Murphy's Irish Stout completed the top ten, on 2 per cent.
One in five of those surveyed picked none of the brands as their favourite, while 5 per cent registered as ''don't 
knows''.
Adrian Brady, founder and chief executive of Eulogy, said: ''Irish brands are still as popular as ever among British 
consumers, and the list gives a taste of which ones they can't live without. It's no surprise to see Ireland's famous 
drinks brands and music stars among them."
Stephen Hughes, director of northern Europe for Enterprise Ireland, said it was critical that Irish brands were 
known, understood and welcomed in Britain - the biggest export market for the Irish economy.
''What's really interesting is the mix of old and new brands," he said. ''In the next few years, it will be interesting to 
see if names from Ireland's environmental, software, construction and financial services sectors begin to appear on 
the radar of British consumers."

Sometimes the numbers simply don't add up. Aer Lingus's share price remained anchored just above the  2 mark 
last week, despite a set of pleasing results that saw like-for-like profits increase 16 per cent to  88 million for the 
year to December.
At this price, the stock market values the former state airline at just  1 billion. It seems harsh for a company with a 
net cash balance of  750 million and 23 coveted landing slots at Heathrow airport that could raise up to  700 million 
if it decided to sell up and shift its London business elsewhere.
Can Aer Lingus's day-to-day business of shuttling passengers to and from Ireland really be worth nothing?
Dermot Mannion, chief executive of Aer Lingus, did not think so last week, describing the airline as ''the most 
successful flag carrier in Europe'' and one that was as efficient and profitable as the best low-cost airlines in the 
world.
Among the achievements of the past year, according to Mannion, were the implementation of major cost-saving 
programmes governing staff and maintenance contracts, the defeat of Ryanair's hostile takeover bid and the 
establishment of the airline's new base in Belfast.
He was also pleased with the increase in passenger numbers on long-haul and short-haul routes, which followed 
the introduction of new aircraft and routes during the year.
But there would be trouble ahead on the oil front. Fuel costs in the current year were set to rise by a staggering  120 
million on the back of soaring oil prices - enough to wipe out last year's profits and a hefty multiple of the planned  
20 million in annual cost savings that will arise from hard-won changes in work practices.
Mannion said the airline had made astute use of fuel hedging strategies so far and had covered over one-third of its 
fuel exposure for the remainder of the year at prices around 30 per cent lower than current levels. These ''excellent'' 
Aer Lingus may be thriving, but share price disappoints
hedges had given the airline fuel supplies for  25 million less than it would have had to pay in the absence of a 
hedging strategy, he said.
Mannion's approach to hedging contrasts sharply with that of Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, whose existing fuel 
hedges expire next month and will leave the no-frills carrier fully exposed to current market prices.
Despite caution over what he expected would be a challenging year, however, Mannion said Aer Lingus was in 
good shape to make its way through an environment of high oil prices and economic uncertainty. This was largely 
down to the liquidity at his disposal arising from the airline's hefty cash resources.
''We have the ability to withstand a short, sharp shock'', he said. ''Aer Lingus will come out of this process even 
stronger than we are today."
While other airlines struggle to stay in business in the months ahead, Aer Lingus at least has significant cash 
resources that will help it to cope. ''There are airlines out there that have a lot less liquidity than we have. They may 
move into loss-making territory and may not be able to survive'', said Mannion.
Aer Lingus's cash balances also provided a welcome boost to the bottom line, earning more than  55 million in 
interest and helping to bring pre-tax profits to  125 million.
For Mannion, the results were better than expected and a vindication of his crusade to keep the airline out of 
Ryanair's hands. For shareholders, however, the sight of the share price languishing below its initial public offering 
level of 18 months ago, will continue to disappoint.
Despite Mannion's pleas in 2006 that shareholders would be better off rejecting Ryanair's offer of  2.80 per share, 
the current share price suggests otherwise.
But they can, at least, take consolation from the fact that Aer Lingus shares have outperformed their peers over the 
past 12 months, confining falls to around 25 per cent. This was far less painful than the 44 per cent fall inRyanair 
shares, near 50 per cent falls in the value of British Airways and Ai r France/KLM, and losses of more than 70 per 
cent experienced by shareholders in European budget airlines Sky Europe and Vueling.

Irish businesses should consider moves to cut carbon emissions as a cost-saving opportunity rather than a 
challenge, according to the cochairman of United Nations working group on climate change cooperation.
Michael Zammit Cutajar - who is also the Maltese ambassador for climate change - visited Ireland for the first time 
last week at the request of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),to give a lecture on the political and 
economic consequences of climate change.
The climate expert holds a key position in the working group that is negotiating a post Kyoto Protocol multilateral 
accord on climate change. He said he was ''heartened'' by both the education and interest about climate change in 
Ireland.
''There were hundreds of people in the Mansion House during my talk, and there were lots of questions and 
different points of view put across," Zammit Cutajar said.' 'I know education about the issue is there in Ireland, and 
see your efforts with taxation on polluting cars.
''While there is a lot of negative talk about climate change, it must be seen as a chance for industry to use 
resources more efficiently.
Improvements in building standards can save a lot of energy and, as the price of oil continues to rise, renewables 
like biofuels will become cheaper. Europe is pushing very hard in this direction, but we have to ensure biofuels don't 
displace food production," he said.
Zammit Cutajar also believes that Ireland has potential for tidal energy, and that this form of power should be raised 
up the political agenda. While he was reluctant to criticise the Irish use of air travel - citing Ireland as ''the home of 
Ryanair'' - he said airline travel would also have to be made more efficient.

A dramatic week for European stocks saw them swinging wildly on the back of news from the US.
"Some of the intraday swings have been very dramatic, but people are still intensely risk averse. Most 'long-only' 
investors are sitting on the sidelines watching, transfixed by the volatility," said Kevin Gardiner, head of global 
equity strategy at HSBC.
The Federal Reserve's liquidity package, announced on Tuesday, prompted a two-day rally, until grim financial 
news kicked in.
The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index lost 1.1 per cent over the week, closing yesterday at 1,255.02.
The losers were financial stocks, as once again troubles in the banking system dominated the headlines. UBS , the 
Swiss bank, was particularly hard-hit by the Bear Stearns news, as rumours swirled that it was also facing liquidity 
problems. It fell more than 7 per cent yesterday afternoon to end the week 5.8 per cent lower at SFr28.44.
On Thursday Carlyle Capital , a highly-leveraged mortgage bond fund listed in Amsterdam, said it could not meet 
escalating margin calls from its lenders, and was defaulting on its debt. Its shares have plunged 85.6 per cent since 
March 6 to Euros 0.72.
Societe Generale outperformed the struggling financial sector, adding 5.8 per cent after it said its Euros 5.5bn rights 
issue was 1.8 times subscribed. Analysts suggested much of the interest in the share issue was down to 
speculation that BNP Paribas, SocGen's larger domestic rival, might bid for SocGen.
Allianz , the German insurer, said it will split its Dresdner Bank unit into two parts - a retail bank and an investment 
bank, with a view to selling the investment bank. Allianz shares ended the week up 0.4 per cent at Euros 111.61.
Shares in oil-dependent companies took a hit as the price of crude oil surged again, reaching a high of Dollars 111 
a barrel on Thursday. Ryanair fell 8.9 per cent to Euros 2.89 while Air France-KLM shed 2.9 per cent to Euros 
15.98.
Financials left reeling after volatile week
The slumping dollar also inflicted some damage, as investors sold off European exporters reliant on US markets. 
EADS , the FrancoGerman aerospace group, was one of the week's worst performers. It lost 9.9 per cent to Euros 
15.77 despite saying on Monday it would seek extra measures to deal with its exposure to the dollar.
Carmakers also retreated. Daimler fell 2.5 per cent to Euros 52.52 while its French rivals Renault and Peugeot fell 
3.4 per cent to Euros 63.60 and 4 per cent to 46.57 respectively.
Volkswagen defied the trend, gaining 3.6 per cent to Euros 157.15 after revealing plans to build 20 new models and 
boost sales to 8m vehicles in 2011.
But Continental , the German carmaker supplier, had a grim week on talk that problems at the powertrain business 
it bought were worse than expected. Continental did its best to reassure investors, reiterating its earnings targets for 
the year, but its shares lost 12.7 per cent to Euros 53.21.
The weaker dollar and the slowdown in US consumer spending overshadowed record earnings from Luxottica , the 
Italian designer eyewear maker. It fell 6 per cent to Euros 16.39.
Swatch , the Swiss watchmaker, sounded a note of caution in spite of an upbeat outlook for this year. Shares in 
Swatch fell 5.9 per cent to SFr287.25.

Aer Lingus has returned to profit in its first full year since being privatised in September 2006.
The carrier, in which Ryanair retains a 29 per cent stake after an unsuccessful bid launched just days after the IPO, 
reported pre-tax profits of Euros 124.7m (Pounds 95m) for 2007. This compares with a loss in 2006 of Euros 79.4m, 
after making a Euros 104m exceptional payment to the staff pension fund as agreed with unions at privatisation.
The results included Euros 42.6m of finance income, taking in interest earned on the large cash deposits it retains 
from the Euros 400m IPO.
Revenues increased 12.6 per cent to Euros 1.1bn, helped by a 71 per cent increase in fees charged for baggage 
check-in, advanced seat selection and so-called ancillary services. John Murray Brown

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has hit out at the UK Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA) decision to 
allow costs at London airports to rise by up to 50 pct between 2008 and 2013.
The CAA yesterday bowed to pressure from BAA to increase the amount the airport operator can charge 
passengers. At London Heathrow the CAA has allowed charges per passenger to rise by 23.5 pct from April 1, 
2008, followed by increases of 7.5 pct plus inflation for each of the following four years. In the case of London 
Gatwick, a similar 21 pct hike next month will be followed by increases of 2 pct plus inflation for each of the 
following four years.
'The bureaucrats have proved to be impotent in defending the interests of travellers against monopolies. This 
decision impacts London's competitiveness as a world city. If we don't fix London's dysfunctional airports, the city's 
regular travellers will find a more convenient home. Frankfurt, for example, would be only too happy to welcome 
them, said Giovanni Bisignani,' IATA's director general and CEO.
The hike in charges were justified, said the CAA, because improvements to Heathrow and Gatwick need to be paid 
for.
Airlines including British Airways PLC, bmi, easyJet PLC, Ryanair Holdings and Virgin Atlantic have all roundly 
opposed the price hikes.

Irish airline Aer Lingus posted a stronger-than-expected return to profit Wednesday in its results for 2007, a year of 
supersonic change for the previously state-owned carrier.
Aer Lingus recorded a net profit of €105.3 million (US$161.7 million) in 2007, compared with a net loss of €69.9 
million the previous year, its last under the control of the Irish government.
Since its flotation on the Irish and British stock exchanges in September 2006, Aer Lingus has fought off a hostile 
takeover by rival Ryanair, battled its pilots and labor unions in a major cost-cutting push, expanded its route network 
and Airbus fleet, and struck a partnership with U.S. no-frills carrier JetBlue Airways Corp.
At the end of it all, Chief Executive Dermot Mannion says Aer Lingus has emerged from privatization as the most 
successful of Europe's surviving national airlines. It appears well positioned to weather record-high oil prices 
because the company used futures to hedge 36 percent of its needs through the end of 2008 at a heavy discount to 
the current cost.
"It is critical that we continue to take cost out of the business so that we can continue to offer customers low fares 
and in doing so remain relevant in our chosen markets," Mannion said.
Revenues rose 15.2 percent to €1.285 billion (US$1.974 billion) as the airline opened a new Northern Ireland base, 
nearly two dozen new European routes, and three new routes to the United States. Aer Lingus also expanded its 
Airbus fleet from 35 to 41.
That expansion meant the airline's number of seats grew 14 percent. But the percentage of seats sold fell to 75.4 
percent from 77.6 percent in 2006, an industry-wide trend in 2007 because of global economic fears.
Aer Lingus added a range of extra costs to its tickets in 2007, aping the practice of no-frills rival Ryanair, which 
pioneered the practice in Europe. Such "ancillary" income which includes charges for check-in luggage and credit-

card use as well as on-board food, drinks and shopping rose 71.5 percent to €108.7 million (US$167 million). Per 
passenger, money generated from these extras rose 58.9 percent to €11.68 (US$17.94) per head.
Fuel costs rose 26.3 percent to €253.3 million (US$389 million). That represented 21.2 percent of total operating 
costs, up from 19.2 percent in 2006.
Aer Lingus boosted its payroll from 3,600 to more than 3,900 in 2007, so staff costs rose 13.8 percent to €307.3 
million (US$472 million).
But Mannion said he was confident that two recently negotiated deals with unions and maintenance contractors 
would save the airline up to €40 million (US$60 million) annually from 2009 onward.
Mannion said the airline wanted to add more routes to the United States, and expected stronger U.S. business in 
2008 from a new code-sharing partnership with JetBlue that begins in April. The agreement allows passengers to 
book combined tickets from Ireland to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, the major hub for JetBlue, to more than 
40 other U.S. cities served by the American carrier.
Aer Lingus shares rose 3 percent to €2.05 (US$3.15) on the Irish Stock Exchange.

To get to Europe, you still have to take a plane. But to get around, some savvy travelers are finding a much 
smoother and sometimes quicker ride on the train.
High-speed rail operators in Europe are ambitiously adding routes and cutting travel times, looking to snatch 
customers from the short-haul airline market. They are also adding perks, such as DVD and movie rentals and free 
newspapers. Plush high-speed trains are luring customers weary of the bare-bones service offered on the many 
discount airlines that have proliferated throughout Europe: Eurostar Group Ltd. trains (which run in the United 
Kingdom, France and Belgium) have 33 inches of leg room in coach, for example. Discount airline Ryanair has 30 
inches of leg room and the seats don't recline.
Spain, which is at the forefront of the rail boom, got high-speed service connecting Madrid and Barcelona last 
month. The journey was slashed by two hours: Now it takes just two hours, 35 minutes. Switzerland in January saw 
the opening of a $3.5 billion, 22-mile tunnel that passes through the Alps, cutting travel time by 45 to 75 minutes 
within the country and between Switzerland and Italy.
In November, Eurostar reduced the travel time by 20 minutes on its popular London-to-Brussels and London-to-
Paris routes. As of late January, there were more than 2,600 miles of high-speed lines under construction in 
Europe, including some 1,400 miles in Spain alone, plus an additional 5,300 miles planned, according to the 
International Union of Railways.
Consumers are flocking to the comfortable, speedy trains while growth is slowing in parts of the airline industry. 
Eurostar reported a 15 percent rise in ticket sales for 2007, with much of the increase occurring after the London 
enhancements. Meanwhile, airport passenger-traffic growth has fallen to 2 percent in Britain for the past two years, 
according to the country's Civil Aviation Authority. Prior to that, traffic had been growing 6 percent a year since the 
1970s.
While the nearly 200-mph trains are of particular use to long-distance commuters and other European-based 
consumers, U.S. travelers also can take advantage, whether they want to visit multiple stops across the Continent 
or just avoid the hassle of taking connecting flights.
Touring Europe at 200 miles an hour
Frank Giaccio, a 60-year-old investment analyst from King of Prussia, Pa., did the latter during a recent trip to Italy. 
He needed to get to San Giovanni Valdarno, a little town a half-hour south of Florence, where he planned to spend 
two weeks studying Italian. He didn't want to fly to Florence, which would have required connecting from Milan and, 
in his opinion, increased the odds of his luggage getting lost. And he definitely didn't want to rent a car and take his 
chances reading road signs. "I was studying Italian very unsuccessfully," he says.
So he took the trains. A high-speed one got him from Milan to Florence in under three hours, and a local one 
covered the remaining distance to San Giovanni Valdarno. The train from Milan made just a brief stop or two, and 
he got to gaze at the rural countryside along the way. "How can you complain?" Mr. Giaccio says, although he 
wasn't thrilled about the euro-dollar exchange rate, which made his one-way fare the equivalent of $48.
Train travelers can also avoid airport security hassles and some of the delays that have plagued flights lately. Last 
year was the fourth straight year that delays increased on intra-European flights, according to the Association of 
European Airlines. Train stations are often more convenient: They tend to be located in city centers. Airports are 
often more remote, especially those where discount airlines tend to fly. For example, Barcelona International Airport 
is about 20 minutes from the city center, but Barcelona Girona Airport, which Ryanair flies into, is 90 kilometers (55 
miles) away.
And as no-frills airlines have become increasingly prevalent in Europe, passengers are being charged for checking 
bags, checking in at the airport, and even for using credit cards. Rail has gone the reverse route, offering more 
perks. Eurostar's trains have power sockets and offer free newspapers and magazines in business and premium 
economy classes on-board. The TGV Med, a French high-speed train that travels from Paris to destinations near 
the Mediterranean coast, has DVD-player and movie rentals. SNCF, France's high-speed rail operator, is launching 
a youth-aimed overnight service to Biarritz and the French Riviera later this year. The service, called IDnight, will 
have music, dancing and an all-night bar.
Weldon Thompson, a Helsinki resident and frequent train traveler, raves about another creature comfort: an easier 
customs process. On a recent ride he took between Basel, Switzerland, and Frankfurt, Germany, a customs agent 
boarded the train during a stop to check the passengers, allowing them to avoid standing in lines, as is often the 
case at the airport. "I've cleared customs sitting in the dining car eating lunch," Mr. Thompson says. This has a 
downside, too, however. During customs checks, the whole train stops and waits until all passengers are cleared.
For now, trains are also better for those who want to stay connected while they travel. Train passengers already 
can use cellphones where a cell signal is available. But European airlines soon may offer voice services too; 
Ryanair plans to begin testing in-flight cellphone service in the second quarter of this year.
Price and route structure remain drawbacks for train travel. The low-cost airlines can be flown more cheaply on 
many routes, including London-to-Paris ($83 on easyJet in April, $180 on Eurostar), even though Eurostar owns 
two-thirds of that route's market share. Despite the 3,400 miles of high-speed lines already operating in Europe, 
many major cities still aren't directly connected. A one-way trip from Amsterdam to Berlin, for example, costs $205 
via Rail Europe, a rail-booking agency, and takes a prohibitive six hours even though the cities are only 350 miles 
apart. On Transavia, a Netherlands low-cost airline, the trip takes 1 hour and 20 minutes and costs $129 round trip.
High-speed trains are most popular on routes that run relatively straight and cover shorter distances. Rail operators 
say customers have historically chosen trains for trips of three hours or less. But Guillaume Pepy, chairman of 
Eurostar, says travelers are now willing to take trains for longer trips. He points out that trains have a 65 percent 
market share on the Paris-to-Toulon route, which the TGV covers in just under four hours. "It's extremely 
comfortable, easy to use and seamless," Mr. Pepy says. "You can use the time exactly as you want: sleep, read, 
work on the computer. It's useful time."
Still, some in the discount-airline industry scoff at the so-called high-speed competition. "I don't think there's any 
concern on our part," says Peter Sherrard, head of communications at Ryanair Holdings PLC, pointing out that 
Ryanair's average fare for a 1 1/2-hour flight is the equivalent of $60. "That's knocking the socks off anything the 
trains are offering. We're doing it faster and lower-cost."
Touring Europe at 200 miles an hour
But a growth in fees and surcharges is causing the low-cost airlines' fares to swell. Ryanair in Jan. raised its fees 
for checking a bag to 9 euros and checking in at the airport to 4 euros, and the airline said it will keep increasing 
fees until it gets at least 50 percent of its passengers to travel with hand luggage only and use free Web check-in. 
Airport and government taxes also cause costs to balloon. So while the round-trip fare for a Ryanair flight from 
London Stansted Airport to Perpignan, France, in late March was $60 as of Tuesday, the cost with taxes jumps to 
$132. And that doesn't include a nearly GBP 3 (about $6) credit-card "handling fee" per flight segment.
On Eurostar, however, you can carry two bags (plus one handbag) free. Additional bags cost GBP 12; bicycles and 
other oversize items are GBP 20.
But Michael Zagurek of Merrimack, N.H., already has decided to use the high-speed trains for a trip he is 
considering taking to Europe later this year. The cramped seats on the discount carriers are foremost on the 6-foot 
computer consultant's mind. "Am I supposed to sit sideways?" he says.

The Dublin market continued to claw back at least some of the significant losses incurred last week as investors 
took their cue from a rally in global stocks.
At the close, the ISEQ was up 104.70 points to 6,260.29.
Leading Wall St, Asian and European shares bounced back after the US Fed and ECB promised a USD200 billion 
booster shot for ailing money markets.
 However, Irish investors were still reluctant to pile in to a market already reeling from a year-long sell-off sparked 
by the credit crisis and faltering US economy. An almost daily stream of bad news on the Irish economic front and 
especially mounting evidence of a slump in property and building. Yesterday was no exception as the latest figures 
from the Central Statistics Office that showed that the volume of retail sales increased in January, rising by 0.9pc 
compared with December. December's figure had shown a pick-up in sales after a drop in November. However, the 
January increase was mainly due to a strong start to the year for motor sales, as the figure excluding this showed a 
drop of 0.1pc. Goodbody's Dermot O'Leary believes that Irish consumers - and how much they will hold back 
spending this year - is the key to how bad the economic downturn will be this year; and it's not looking good. 
Corporate results, meanwhile, focussed minds on the Irish market with Aer Lingus delivering better than expected 
full-year results in what it conceded was a tough year - its first as a quoted company. Shares in the airline rose by 
10c to E2.09 while Ryanair gained 3c to E3.10 with investors holding back somewhat as crude oil futures broke yet 
more records on the world markets and with Aer Lingus having hedged just a third of their fuel needs while Ryanair 
is left almost totally exposed to price rises this year. Banks put in their best performance in well over a week with 
AIB shares rallying by 36c to E13.71, Bank of Ireland up 9c to E9.29, Anglo Irish climbed 26c to E8.87 and Irish Life 
and Permanent jumped by 30c to E10.85. A surge in financial share prices on Wall St helped the Irish banks but 
while the US banking shares are down an average of 14pc in the past year, Irish banks have plummeted by over 
ISEQ rises in line with world markets
50pc. Elsewhere, shares in Irish prospector, Tullow, surged by 34c to E8.47 despite it having reported a full-year 
pre-tax profits that plunged by 57pc as gas prices fell and exploration write-offs eroded earnings. However, 
investors applauded surging revenues and see its African well prospects as a potential bonanza with crude prices 
hovering around USD110 a barrel. Tullow posted pre-tax profits of £114.2m compared to £263.3m on sales 
revenues that gained 10pc to £639.2m. The financial performance of the group overall was good, Tullow said, 
including operating cash flow before working capital of £474 million, despite lower profit "which was principally 
impacted by lower UK gas prices, an increased depreciation charge, exploration write-offs and interest charges". 
Builders put in a more mixed performance with CRH shares down 6c to e24.69 while Grafton gained 15c to E5.45 
and McInerney - hammered in the recent sell off and after some disappointing results - managed to rise by 7c to 
E1.28.

Better-than-expected financial results pushed Aer Lingus shares up by 9c to 208c this morning.
The airline announced that its key figure of operating profit before employee profit share was up 16.4 percent on 
2006, 5 percent ahead of analysts' forecasts.
Stephen Furlong, analyst at Davy Stockbrokers said "Shares are well supported by net cash of EUR 757 million at 
year end, slots and aircraft. We will review our forecasts following the analysts' briefing but would view the numbers 
and statement as good as could be expected given the macro variables in play."
 Joe Gill of Goodbody commented: "Aer Lingus is as well placed as any EU airline to manage very difficult trading 
conditions. It continues to target additional cost improvements to combat macroeconomic and competitive 
pressures. These are essential to ensuring a sustainable business model against its key competitors." "To date, 
progress in that context is evident in these numbers. Based on last night's closing price, net cash equates to 71.6 
percent of Aer Lingus' market capitalisation, while cash coupled with the value of its Heathrow slots amounts to 145 
percent of market value. Somewhere, somehow, value investors have to take a peek at this company." Elsewhere, 
Aer Lingus came under fire from Ryanair, with the budget airline criticising the flag carrier for raising fuel surcharges 
and 3.1 percent and 5.7 percent increases in its short and long haul fares respectively.

Stansted runway application spurs protests

BAA, the airports operator, yesterday applied for planning permission to build a second runway and terminal at 
London Stansted airport, triggering fierce opposition from environmental campaigners, residents and local 
authorities.
The Stop Stansted Expansion campaign said the planning application went "beyond environmental vandalism" and 
was "tantamount to a declaration of war on the local community and global environment".
BAA said the first phase of the Pounds 2.5bn project could open in 2015 and could create capacity to handle 68m 
passengers a year - as many as at Heathrow currently - by around 2030. This would more than double the present 
capacity limit on the existing runway of 25m passengers a year.
BAA is still waiting for the government's decision on a previous planning inquiry to raise the single runway capacity 
limit to 35m passengers a year.
Sir Nigel Rudd, BAA chairman, said the operator remained "fully committed" to building a second runway, which 
was "central to government policy" for delivering additional runway capacity in the south-east.
The project would bring "huge benefits to the east of England and UK economy" and would "increase choice and 
opportunity for millions of business and leisure travellers", Sir Nigel said.
If approved, the second runway would be the first full-length runway in the south-east in 50 years.
A prolonged battle is looming over aviation policy, with the government also separately supporting the building of a 
third runway and sixth terminal at Heathrow by late in the next decade.
A December 2003 aviation white paper called for the building of two new runways in the south-east, led by a 
second runway at Stansted.
Airport charges at Stansted would have to rise steeply to support the investment, which has triggered vocal 
opposition from operators at the airport, led by Ryanair and EasyJet. The Civil Aviation Authority, the airports 
Stansted runway application spurs protests
economic regulator, has ruled out any crosssubsidisation by BAA of Stansted from its Heathrow and Gatwick 
airports.
BAA said the Stansted project could lead to the creation of more than 13,000 jobs by 2030. The development would 
take place in phases with construction expected to start in 2011 and first operations planned for 2015.
The first phase of the scheme by 2015 would cost Pounds 1.4bn with subsequent stages raising the total cost to 
Pounds 2.5bn, including BAA's contribution to improved road and rail links to the airport.
Essex county council warned yesterday that the development of Stansted would bring "significant environmental 
damage whilst placing a huge strain on existing public services and infrastructure".
Lord Hanningfield, leader of the council, said: "This is not what the people of Essex want and it is not what the 
people of Britain need. The economics and business case behind this . . . totally contradicts the government's so-
called commitment to protecting the environment as well as reducing emissions."

Airlines attack CAA price regulations

Airlines yesterday launched a fierce attack on the economic regulation of the three leading London airports, as the 
Civil Aviation Authority announced a big increase in the charges BAA, the airport operator, can set at Heathrow and 
Gatwick.
The attack came as a CAA official disclosed that BAA would be unable to meet its original aim of completing the 
planned Pounds 1bn Heathrow East terminal in time for the London Olympics in the summer of 2012.
Four of the largest airlines operating from the UK - BMI British Midland, EasyJet, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic - joined 
forces in an unusual display of unity to demand an overhaul of the regulatory system and a break-up of the BAA 
London airports monopoly.
BAA's structure is already being investigated by the Competition Commission.
The airlines also called for Ruth Kelly, the transport secretary, to intervene to resolve the CAA's failings and 
demanded a moratorium on the price increases. The "failing finances" of BAA, which operates seven UK airports, 
should also be made public, they said.
The four airlines said the "dramatic" price rises at Heathrow and Gatwick showed the system was "broken and 
needs to be changed".
They complained the CAA was allowing charges at Heathrow to increase by 86 per cent from Pounds 10.36 to 
Pounds 19.31 per passenger during the next five years, while charges at Gatwick would rise by 49 per cent from 
Pounds 5.61 to Pounds 8.36.
The airlines said the increases would "inevitably hurt consumers".
Any rise in fares as a result of the higher charges is likely to be limited by competition between the airlines, 
however, and would be dwarfed by the impact of higher oil prices on airline finances and ticket prices.
Airlines attack CAA price regulations
The CAA said it was increasing the Heathrow price cap - the maximum fee the airport can charge the airlines - by 
Pounds 2.44, or 23.5 per cent in real terms, to Pounds 12.80 per passenger for the coming year from April 2008. 
Charges in the four subsequent years could rise 7.5 per cent a year above inflation.
Harry Bush, CAA group director for economic regulation, said improvements in airport facilities and service 
standards including Pounds 5bn of investment over the next five years and a halving of security queuing times 
"have to be paid for in increased charges". The outcome for passengers should be "decently modern airports and 
consistently high service standards".
Mr Bush maintained that the need for the capital investment - Pounds 4.79bn at Heathrow and Pounds 920m at 
Gatwick in the next five years - and increased spending on security had broadly been agreed between the airlines 
and the airports, but the carriers were not happy to have to pay for the investment.
He revealed that BAA would be unable to meet its original aim of completing Heathrow East in time for the London 
Olympics in 2012. Phase one of the project, which is eventually to replace Terminals 1 and 2, would not be 
completed until the end of 2012, he said.
The CAA said it had toughened the standards of service BAA must meet at Heathrow and Gatwick and had more 
than doubled the maximum penalties it would incur for missing targets.
Mr Bush refuted claims by the airlines that the CAA had given in to BAA pressure by agreeing excessive charges to 
help finance debts loaded on to the company when it was acquired in 2006 in a highly leveraged take-over by a 
consortium led by Spain's Ferrovial.
Analysts have expressed fears about BAA's ability to finance investment commitments, but it said yesterday it 
remained committed to spending Pounds 4.8bn in the next five years on UK airports.

Chill in store for the confident airline consolidators

Body
British Airways last week sent a chill through the airline industry. It warned that a severe global downturn had 
started in what has always been a highly cyclical industry. Soaring oil prices and the general economic slowdown, 
especially in the US, were damping the outlook for air traffic.
The UK flag carrier seemed to be simply confirming the earlier forecast of the International Air Transport 
Association. After three solid years of growth, global air traffic is slowing down. International traffic grew only 4.3 per 
cent in January after 6.7 per cent in December and 7.4 per cent for the whole of 2007. What has until recently been 
the industry's fastest growing sector - low cost airlines such as Ryanair and Easyjet - have also been warning of a 
turn in the cycle.
Yet Europe's two largest airlines, Air France-KLM and Lufthansa, do not appear to share the industry gloom. The 
Franco-Dutch carrier has so far suggested that it is not experiencing any significant signs of a downturn. Its 
premium class passenger bookings are holding up pretty well and the airline claims it cannot meet demand for its 
long-haul services.
Lufthansa has just reported impressive profits for last year and announced plans to boost capacity by about 7.5 per 
cent this summer to meet demand and fly to 15 new destinations. The German carrier is expected to issue today its 
forecast for this year and is likely to express continued confidence in the future.
How come both Air France-KLM and Lufthansa seem to be showing far greater resistance to the turbulence 
spreading in the airline business than their immediate competitors? Could it be that as industry consolidators they 
have developed a business model that helps them hedge against the ups and downs of the cycle?
The irony is that many believed these airlines were taking risky gambles when they embarked on their consolidation 
strategies and made what some considered potentially catastrophic deals. Yet Air France has never looked back 
since it merged with KLM. So much so that the Franco-Dutch airline is still keen to take over Alitalia, the Italian flag 
carrier regarded as the biggest basketcase in European aviation. But then an eventual takeover of Alitalia could turn 
into another longer-term opportunity to expand both market share and scale, just as Lufthansa has done with Swiss 
Airlines.
Chill in store for the confident airline consolidators
BA, which decades ago considered itself a prime industry consolidator, has been flying in the opposite direction. 
This strategy helped it regain altitude in terms of profitability, but the UK carrier now seems far more exposed to the 
difficult times ahead than its two main European peers.
That said, the stock market performance of both Air France-KLM and Lufthansa in the past few months has also 
been pretty awful. This suggests that for all the confidence of the two airlines' managements, the markets are 
already pricing in a significant downturn even for Europe's star airline consolidators.
Car wars
A huge and most peculiar corporate struggle is taking place at Volkswagen and Porsche. The battle does not 
involve just the two German car companies but also the rich and powerful families behind them. It threatens to 
leave few winners but many losers.
When Porsche first bought its stake in VW in September 2005 everything seemed rosy. VW management was 
happy to have a friendly large investor, as were the workers; Porsche executives had landed a coup; and its two 
founding families could celebrate not just the promise of heady future profits but the regrouping of the two 
companies Ferdinand Porsche helped set up.
But things have taken a strange and bitter turn. Porsche's meddling in internal VW affairs is driving some VW 
executives crazy. The sports car maker's blunt style has offended VW workers, prompting them to describe 
Porsche's chief executive, Wendelin Wiedeking, as a "Napoleon" before his Waterloo and the once friendly deal as 
a "hostile takeover".
Worse, it is splitting the two controlling Porsche families - the Piechs and the Porsches. Ferdinand Piech, the family 
patriarch and VW chairman, is as secure as ever at VW. But Wolfgang Porsche, whose family controls more 
Porsche shares than the Piech family, is chairman in charge at the sports car maker.
The result is the two are now using their companies as weapons in the power struggle between them. Mr Piech 
struck out last week by buying truck maker Scania for VW. But his attempts to undermine Mr Wiedeking at Porsche 
backfired when Mr Porsche resolutely supported him.
VW may be enjoying a good profitable run, but there is still plenty of fat to be cut. If the two families continue 
squabbling about who should be running the show, they risk driving into a brick wall.

ruling.
Body
Budget airline Ryanair said today that the European Court of First Instance (ECFI) has heard its appeal against the 
European Commission's ruling in the 2004 Charleroi case.
Ryanair claims that in reaching the decision on this case, the Commission ignored 30 years of Market Economy 
Investor Principal precedent cases and changed its own rules in the Charleroi case in order to find against the 
airline.
Ryanair also claims that the Commission failed to apply the accepted MEIP test, obliging it to allow state owned 
companies to compete on a level playing field with similar privately owned companies.
 Commenting today following the hearing at the ECFI in Luxembourg, Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs, Jim 
Callaghan, said: "Ryanair is happy to have finally forced the European Commission into court. We are confident 
that the ECFI will overturn what is a patently wrong and anti-competitive decision." "The case evidence clearly 
shows that the Commission went to extreme lengths to invent a finding of state aid in this case and to use it as a 
precedent to regulate all publicly owned airports."

The European Commission said Tuesday they are investigating if Ryanair Holdings PLC gets a cut-price deal on 
airport charges from Slovakia's Bratislava airport that is unfair to other airlines.
It said its investigation into what it sees as a possible illegal state subsidy was triggered by a complaint alleging that 
the airport gives Ryanair huge discounts on airport charges for opening new routes and maintaining existing ones.
The EU warned that the rebates would not be legal if Ryanair was profiting from them in the long-term and that it 
could demand Ryanair pay the full cost of the charges.
Ryanair said it believed the "spurious" complaint had come from either Austrian Airlines or a Vienna airport trying to 
block rival services from Bratislava which is some 60 kilometers (37 miles) from the Austrian capital.
Bratislava airport has so far refused to give EU regulators a copy of its agreement with Ryanair.
The EU executive said its information shows the airport struck a deal in December 2005, offering Ryanair a 
discount of up to 48 percent for new routes and up to 31 percent for others.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, has helped revolutionize travel across Europe by pioneering cheap 
flights to regional airports that have sent record numbers of European passengers to the skies on the way to a 
wider range of destinations.
Eager to pull in new tourist traffic, small airports offer sweeteners to these airlines that have, in some cases, already 
fallen foul of EU authorities. In 2004, Ryanair was ordered to pay back 4.5 million euros it got from Belgium's 
Charleroi airport and change a contract that would allow it recoup up to 90 percent of its costs over 15 years.

Travelers using London's two biggest airports can expect to be charged higher fees announced Tuesday by 
Britain's airline regulator.
The Civil Aviation Authority said higher fees, effective April 1, are needed to pay for improvements at Heathrow and 
Gatwick airports, and for increased security.
British Airways accused the agency of caving in to pressure from the airport owner, BAA, a subsidiary of Grupo 
Ferrovial of Spain, but BAA complained that the settlement was insufficient.
Virgin Atlantic, bmi, easyJet and Ryanair joined in the criticism, saying the regulatory system had failed. They called 
for an end to BAA's monopoly of London's big three airports, including Stansted.
BAA contended that the Civil Aviation Authority recognized "the scale of the task we are embarked on, the 
pressures of handling such large infrastructure projects, the full cost of the increased security requirements, as well 
as the impact of the credit market turmoil."
The Civil Aviation Authority said it would allow fees to rise 23.5 percent at Heathrow to the equivalent of $25.82 per 
passenger, effective April 1. At Gatwick it is allowing a 21 percent increase to the equivalent of $13.70 per 
passenger.
The fee is charged for each departure or arrival at the airport.
Although the fee is assessed against airlines, the charge is generally added to ticket prices.
On its Web site, British Airways tells passengers: "You must pay any taxes, fees and charges imposed on us or on 
you by governments or other authorities, or by operators of airports."
Regulator allows steep passenger fee hikes at Heathrow and Gatwick airports
In the following four years, fees at Heathrow will increase by no more than retail price inflation, while Gatwick fees 
can go up by 2 points more per year than the inflation rate. The airports are the two busiest in Britain.
"These higher airport charges are essentially paying for the modernization of Heathrow and Gatwick, in terms of 
both facilities and service, for the direct benefit of the passenger," the Civil Aviation Authority said.
At Heathrow, that includes paying for the new Terminal 5, which enters service this month, the building of a new 
East Terminal by 2013 and upgrading of existing facilities.
At Gatwick, there are plans for expanding terminal facilities and installing a new baggage system.
British Airways, the dominant carrier at Heathrow and the sole customer at Terminal 5, rejected that explanation 
and said the regulatory system had failed.
"These overly generous charges far exceed what is required to upgrade facilities across Heathrow through 
investment in infrastructure and improved service quality levels," said Paul Ellis, British Airways general manager 
for airport policy and infrastructure.
"When BAA's new owners, Ferrovial, bought them, the CAA said they would not be influenced by Ferrovial's high 
debt levels," Ellis added.
"In practice, they have ignored their own policy and caved in to intense pressure from BAA by setting excessive 
price increases. Heathrow passengers will pay, on average, 17 percent more than the Competition Commission 
recommended in September," he added.

Irish investigators are attributing a serious air proximity incident between a Flightline Boeing MD-83 and a Ryanair 
Boeing 737-800 last September to a breakdown in communications between two air traffic control officers (ATCOs).
The 737 had been westbound from London Stansted to Cork, cruising at flight level 300 (30,000ft/9,150m), while 
the MD-83 was flying north on the Faro-Dublin route at the lower altitude of FL280.
Two Shannon-based controllers were overseeing the aircraft, which were off Ireland's south-east coast at the time. 
The planning controller informed the radar controller that the two aircraft had substantially different ground speeds, 
with the MD-83 closing rapidly from the south.
After the 737 crew requested a descent towards Cork, the radar controller cleared the aircraft to FL100. This 
descent instruction was not noticed by the planning controller, who was distracted by an operational telephone call.
The distance between the two aircraft at the time was 14nm (26km) and the short-term conflict-alert system 
activated. As the distance reduced to 8nm, the radar controller attempted to halt the 737's descent by instructing 
the crew to level at FL290 - by which time the jet had already descended below this altitude.
Shortly afterwards the MD-83 crew, which had twice been told to change heading as the aircraft closed on one 
another, then initiated a descent following a resolution advisory from the collision-avoidance system. The 737 crew 
similarly responded to an advisory to climb.
Ireland's Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) says the aircraft were separated by 3nm laterally and 600ft vertically 
at their closest point. "Neither controller played any part in the ultimate safe resolution of this avoidable air 
proximity," it states, adding that there was a "critical breakdown" in follow-up communication between the two.
Irish airprox blamed on controllers INTRODUCTION: 'Critical breakdown' in communication between ATCOs 
led to close call between Ryanair 737 and Flightline MD-83
"In spite of at least four warnings - one verbal and three electronic - the radar controller appeared not to 
comprehend the closing speeds of the two aircraft and allowed the higher one to descend and lose the required 
minimum vertical and lateral separation from the other. What ensued was a critical failure of the human element of 
the air traffic control system to rectify this situation."
In its inquiry into the 23 September 2007 event the AAIU points out the large difference in experience levels 
between the two controllers. It says the more-experienced planner, who did not intervene after the initial caution 
over the aircraft speeds, might have offered greater assistance by monitoring the aircraft and exercising greater 
assertiveness.
But it adds that there was "no possibility" of controller confusion because the radar display was uncluttered and 
electronic warnings were clearly displayed. The AAIU has advised that the Irish Aviation Authority review its training 
and team resource management processes to take the incident into account.

The European Commission said it has launched a formal investigation into an agreement to provide airport services 
at Bratislava airport, following a complaint from a third party that the agreement favours Ryanair Holdings PLC.
The commission said the decision requires the airport to submit a copy of the agreement to it, which it has so far 
refused to do.
Without access to this document, and on the basis of the information provided by the complainant, the commission 
said it has doubts about its compatibility with EU rules on state aid.

The EU Commission has launched an investigation in to alleged discounts given to Ryanair by Bratislava Airport.
This follows a complaint which alleged that the airport offers Ryanair reduced airport charges for existing 
destinations and new scheduled flights. The commission says the discounts could be up to 31pc for existing 
destinations and 48pc for new services.
But the commission says that, in spite of requests, it has not been provided with the text of the agreement. It says 
Bratislava airport has so far refused to comply with a request for a copy of the deal.
 'Without access to this document, and on the basis of the information provided by the complainant, the 
Commission has doubts about its compatibility with EU rules on State aid,' said the commission. The European 
Commission ruled in 2004 that some of the state aid paid to Ryanair by the publicly-owned airport in Charleroi, 
south of the Belgian capital Brussels, was illegal.

The south of France has maintained its status as one of the favoured destinations for Irish buyers for a number of 
years.
This week, Key to France is launching a new four-star coastal leaseback development, situated between Marseille 
and Nice.
The development is located 200 metres from the seafront and has views of Bandol/Six Fours Bay. It is due to be 
completed next year and is located in the popular seaside town of Six-Fours, opposite the island of Embiez.
There is a 28 kilometre stretch of coastline dotted with islands and coves from the bay of Six-Fours to the bay of La 
Seyne.The development is 500 metres from the closest beach and 200 metres from the town harbour. It will 
comprise 107 units, made up of one to three-bedroom apartments.
All of the apartments will be fully furnished to a high standard and amenities will include an outdoor heated 
swimming pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi.
This is a new build leaseback, with an option for purchasers to have their rents for the 11-year lease period paid in 
advance by w ay of a deduction from the property p urchase price. The Vat, which is usually refunded by t he 
French government after completion, is being pre-financed by the developer.
This project is very m uch aimed at the lifestyle market, as there is an option to use the property p ersonally f or up 
to six months, with a reduced return. Guaranteed rental is available at up to 3.4 per cent per year index-linked.
One-bed apartments vary upwards from 30 square metres - the French use a measure of internal useable space, 
rather than the external measurements used here, so sizes tend to appear a lot smaller.
Two-beds range upwards from 41 square metres, while three-beds range from 59 square metres. All of the 
properties come with furniture and parking.
French leaseback scheme to attract Irish investors
T he development is half an hour from Toulon airport, which can be reached with Ryanair via London Stansted. It is 
also an hour from Marseille and 1.5 hours from Nice, giving access from around Ireland.
Prices start from  168,000 for a one-bedroom apartment or  120,000 with the 11-year rent pre-paid, including six 
weeks personal use per year. For further information, contact 01-8430958 or visit www.keytofrance.com.

Lisbon's lucrative golfing properties

The Algarve isn't the only show in town when comes to golfing in Portugal. Diarmaid Condon discovers the delights 
of the Lisbon coast.
Portugal and golf - it has to be the Algarve, doesn't it? Well, not exactly.
The Irish have had an ongoing love affair with Portugal's southern coastline for many years, but there are signs that 
another area of the country may now be claiming more than its fair share of holidaymakers and property buyers.
This is the Lisbon coast, which can be split into two distinct, and very different, regions. North of Lisbon, on the 
Costa de Prata or Silver Coast, you'll find rolling hills introducing the coastline. To the south of the Portuguese 
capital, on the opposing banks of the Tagus estuary, you'll find many kilometres of flat, protected pine forest land 
and plenty of untouched beaches. Termed the Costa Azul or Blue Coast, this region has some 60,000 hectares of 
protected areas, making it one of the largest nature zones in Europe.
It was not until relatively recently that there was direct access from Ireland to Lisbon, hence there wasn't a lot of 
Irish traffic to the area. Since the advent of Aer Lingus flights to the Portuguese capital from D ublin, however, there 
are now many more Irish looking to this wonderful stretch of Atlantic coastline. If you want to venture further north, 
Ryanair also operates flights to Porto.
The Lisbon coast can more than hold its own, in terms of the quality and quantity of its golf courses. In fact, may 
golfers claim tha t the courses on the Lisbon coast are superior to those of the Algarve.
Travelling from s outh to north, you will find no less than 23 courses dotted along the coastline from Sines to 
Obidos, two of which are in Lisbon city itself. Added to this are a number of courses which have not yet been 
completed but which are worthy of consideration.
Lisbon's lucrative golfing properties
It is a lovely area in which to play golf, as the climate is very acceptable, even in spring. The area is also a lot more 
comfortable, compared with the Algarve - which can become incredibly hot in July and August - in which to play in 
the summer.
Silver Coast
Lying between the cities of Porto and Lisbon, the Silver Coast is rapidly evolving into the new Portuguese property 
hotspot. Although it doesn't get the high temperatures of the Algarve, it still enjoys an excellent climate and has the 
added advantage of proximity to the historic and picturesque city of Lisbon.
The coast, known locally as the Costa de Prata, is home to kilometres of unspoiled, crowd-free white sandy 
beaches, which take on the full force of the Atlantic, lowering summer temperatures and making it a popular 
windsurfing destination.
Prices in the region are below the country's average and considerably lower than those in the Algarve. The area's 
flagship development is Praia d'El Rey, near the historic town of Obidos, which celebrated its tenth birthday last 
year and is given credit for putting the Silver Coast firmly on property investors' radars.
The course won both European Golf Resort of the Year and Portugal's Leading Resort at the World Travel Awards 
in 2007. Here, over 800 villas, townhouses and apartments surround a highly-rated championship golf course, 
tennis centre and five-star Marriott beachfront hotel.
The 6,405-metre par-72 course is immaculately maintained and suitable for scratch golfers and amateur hackers 
alike. The back nine plays largely along the coastline, which makes it very picturesque but also a bit breezy on 
occasion. The front nine is set on pine-surrounded parkland. This is a mature course with longstanding planning 
permission, which allows it to build very close to the coast. The current course is nearing build-out, but there is 
some property still available.
Two-bed townhouses in Villa dos Principes, near the clubhouse, start from  346,000, and there is a three-year 
guaranteed rental agreement on certain units.
The company will launch a new course right next to this one, on the coast in front of Oceanico's Royal Obidos 
course, in the autumn. Another course nearby which is well worth a mention is Bom Sucesso. This is a new course, 
which doesn't open for play until later this summer, but which has been designed in a very unique manner. No 
fewer than 23 award-winning Portuguese and international architects were given the task of designing what is most 
certainly one of the most unique golf developments you'll ever encounter.
The most highly regarded properties are probably the David Chipperfield-designed villas, which are selling from  1.4 
million, but there are many creative designs to choose from, encompassing villas, townhouses and apartments.
Apartment prices start from  350,000, but don't expect to find any traditional Portuguese architecture on the course. 
Jessica Kuerten's Quintas de Obidos next-door may be more to your liking, if that is what you are after, but one of 
the 16 villas there will set you back more than  1.5 million. Prime Locations will officially launch Bom Sucesso in the 
Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin on the weekend of April 18.
Campo Real is a Donald Steel-designed course in the heart of the rolling Oeste region, close to the small town of 
Turcifal. It is 30 minutes north of Lisbon and 15 minutes from the beach. The course is designed to embrace the 
natural contours of the land on which it sits, so most of the hazards are natural, rather than manmade.
It is more challenging than your average resort course, so will suit those who want to do more than just saunter 
through a characterless and unchallenging round of golf. You won't become blase about playing this 6,009-metre 
par-72 course, even if you do so several times in a week.
The resort features the first Westin hotel in Portugal, which opened last October and which features a spa, gym and 
indoor and outdoor pools. You can also make use of a state-of-the-art equestrian centre, tennis courts and a multi-
purpose playing field.
Lisbon's lucrative golfing properties
The Campo Real estate is currently marketing properties in its new Vineyards development, which includes a 
further nine holes. Townhouses start at  445,000, with apartments from  260,000. Should you so wish, properties 
can be managed by the Westin group, with a guaranteed 6 per cent per year net rental income for two years for the 
three-bed townhouses, and 5 per cent per year for three years for the villas and apartments.
Blue Coast
Just thirty minutes south of Lisbon, on what is known as the Blue Coast or Costa Azul, you will find theTroia 
Peninsula. This is an area which is being touted as one to watch for the future. The proposed new airport for Lisbon 
has now been confirmed for Alcochete, south of the estuary, which should provide a boost to property sales in the 
area.
The plum development in this region is very likely to be a new project currently underway at the Herdade do 
Pinheirinho Golf and Leisure Resort. This is a marvellous site set among naturally rolling sand dunes, an hour south 
of Lisbon.
The development is being carried out in a natural and eco-friendly manner, which is, in itself, quite unusual. The golf 
course won't be ready for a few years yet - at the moment, the site is being cleared - but, if properly done, this could 
well be one of the best courses in Portugal in years to come. On completion, it will contain 204 luxury villas, a five-
star hotel and four condo-hotels among three tourist resorts.
The smallest villa is 250 square metres, and prices vary from  1.3 million up to  5.5 million for varying types and 
sizes. For those interested in a more mature course, the Quinta do Peru¤ Golf and Country Club may hit the spot. 
This is a 6,036-metre par-72 course, which is regularly voted into Portugal's top ten. It is a lovely course to play, but 
offers copious opportunity to hit bunkers or timber - if you are that way inclined.
The course has a selection of villas built and under construction around its perimeter. There is one spectacular 
example surrounded by water at the 16th, but it's already taken. Prices start from  800,000 for a villa and site. If 
you're a beginner or don't wish to exert yourself unduly, you could consider Palmela Village, which is a leisurely 
3,750-metre par-61 course 30minutes south of Lisbon.
The property here is extremely good value for money. The design features clean and modern architecture, so 
again, it is not one for the Portuguese purist. The use of vibrant colour and lots of glass, sometimes entire end 
walls, are some of the distinguishing features you'll find here. Forty square metre studios start at  108,000, with 50 
square metre one-beds from  150,000.
These are by no means the only courses in the region - others of note include Troia, which is currently closed for 
upgrading; Estoril; Penha Longa; and Aroeira, so you need never be stuck for a good game of golf while visiting 
Lisbon.

Racing is one of the few sports where, if you are lucky, you can leave the premises with more money in your pocket 
than when you went in. It is also a sociable sport with time between the bursts of action for socialising and 
cementing relationships or contacts.
The growing attendances at jump meetings have made the sport attractive to sponsors. Only football gets more 
spectators than racing over a year and only Wimbledon draws more than Cheltenham's 232,000 over four days.
Sponsorship has helped to boost prize money in jump racing from Pounds 26m in 2002 to Pounds 37m in 2006. At 
the Cheltenham Festival, the Gold Cup is now worth Pounds 450,000, with the races averaging prize money of 
Pounds 137,000. In spite of the risks of association with a sport that inevitably involves a number of equine and 
human casualties, Cheltenham attracts a wide range of sponsors, a number of which are, unsurprisingly, Irish 
companies such as Smurfit Kappa, Anglo Irish Bank, Guinness and Ryanair, the Festival's "official airline".
Ryanair this year sees its sponsored race, the Ryanair Chase over 2 miles 5 furlongs, promoted to Grade One. The 
prize money has been raised, too, from Pounds 175,000 to Pounds 200,000. This may seem quite a price to pay 
but Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary sees the Festival as a natural fit. The Irish airline carries 12,000-
15,000 extra passengers thanks to Cheltenham and benefits from advance publicity for its race over a full six 
months. "In terms of the mentions in newspapers and on TV," he says, "the sponsorship deal brings us Pounds 1m 
of publicity." Peter McNeile, Cheltenham's director of sponsorship, says that, unlike Epsom, Cheltenham does not 
seek an overall sponsor but finds sponsors for individual races. Perhaps aware of complaints that the Festival is 
coming to dominate the jumping season to the detriment of others, McNeile works with sponsors to leverage 
support across other meetings, too, and insists: "We go out of our way not to be a predator on other people's 
sponsors."

Whatever the weather, spring will arrive at precisely 2pm next Tuesday in Gloucestershire. The helicopters of the 
rich will have clattered in over Cleeve Hill. Numb fingers will have wrestled with car-park hampers (surely only the 
British could picnic in March). The first of 170,000 pints of Guinness will have been sunk and revved-up younger 
jockeys, struggling into the tights they wear beneath their breeches, will be dreaming that this year they will ride 
their first winner at the Cheltenham Festival.
On breezy slopes, the spectators will open their lungs to roar off the start of the first race at the Festival. That 
tradition, invented by the crowd, encompasses a range of emotions: from the relief of the racing community that 
Cheltenham has come round again, after months of effort from trainers, work riders and stable staff to ensure their 
charges are at a peak of fitness; to the exhilaration of the crowd at the thought of what lies ahead: four days of 
drama, effort and excess that will test both wallets and livers.
There are no more thrilling sporting sights than a huge field tearing down the hill in the Triumph Hurdle, jostling for a 
gap at nearly 40 miles an hour, or the jockeys in the Queen Mother Champion Chase driving their mounts into the 
last fence, asking for one final effort as they seek momentum for the lung-draining climb back up to the finishing 
post. And all enveloped in a wall of partisan sound.
But other courses have thrilling races, too. So what makes Cheltenham special? First, it is the assurance of quality, 
the knowledge that the best horses will be in competition with each other. "It is the Olympics of racing," says 
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary, who is both a racehorse owner and, through his company, a race sponsor 
at the Festival. "You will see the best jumps horses from England, Ireland and France. You know that every owner, 
trainer and jockey is busting a gut to win. There's that, a very challenging course and the carnival atmosphere."
There may be argument about what constitutes the greatest racing experience on the Flat. Royal Ascot, the Epsom 
Derby, its Kentucky equivalent, the Breeders' Cup series that moves around a cluster of US racetracks, and the 
Bottoms up, it's Cheltenham Tuesday signals the start of four days of drinking, daredevil betting and sporting

richly endowed Dubai World Cup, which takes place at the end of this month: all have their supporters. Over 
obstacles, however, Cheltenham, where the Festival meeting includes the Gold Cup, the Champion Hurdle, the 
World Hurdle over three miles, and the Queen Mother Champion Chase over the minimum distance of two miles, is 
acknowledged as the supreme event. Its only rival is Aintree's Grand National meeting and the National, though 
carrying a bigger prize, is a handicap (where weights are adjusted according to ability. theoretically giving every 
horse an equal chance of winning) not a championship race at level weights.
If you grow up in a family with an interest in racing, says O'Leary, "there are two races you remember, the Grand 
National and the Cheltenham Gold Cup. To win either is a dream come true. Why? Because it's so bloody difficult." 
O'Leary's War of Attrition won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2006. At the time he declared: "I've died and gone to 
heaven."
Most spectators will have their own precious memory of a favourite contest, a winner heftily backed, a moment of 
glory etched on the inner eye for ever more. Perhaps the older ones were there for the epic Gold Cup contests in 
the 1960s between the incomparable Arkle and the brave Mill House; others for the popular grey Desert Orchid's 
triumph in 1989 or for the third of Best Mate's big race victories in 2004, when he showed that he wasn't just an 
athlete blessed with a high cruising speed but a doughty battler too. And sometimes, the little man wins too. 
Regulars won't forget how Welsh farmer-trainer Sirrell Griffiths won the 1990 Gold Cup with the 100-1 shot Norton's 
Coin, having started the day by milking his herd of cows in Carmarthen. Legend too is the Irishman who won 
enough on Istabraq in the Champion Hurdle of 1998 to pay off his mortgage and then lost his house on Doran's 
Pride in the Gold Cup. "It was only a small house anyway," he is reputed to have said.
The gambling turnover is colossal at Cheltenham, and sets it apart from most other meetings. The on-course Tote, 
or bookmaker, is operated on a pool system according to the number of bets placed, and this alone takes upwards 
of Pounds 2.5m a day throughout the Festival. Together with other on-course bookies, those who operate off-
course and betting exchanges it is reckoned that about Pounds 400m is gambled over the four days.
In fact, says Edward Gillespie, Cheltenham's managing director, some spectators come just to watch the more 
fearless punters in action. "When people come for the first time they say they've never physically seen so much 
money change hands," he says. "In our daily lives we don't often see such handfuls of notes." These punters 
include the Geneva-based Irish financier and racehorse owner JP McManus, who has been known to wager more 
than Pounds 500,000 on a race.
Leading owner David Johnson recalls taking at least Pounds 500,000 out of the (bookies') "ring" when Well Chief 
won the Arkle Trophy at the Festival in 2004. "Everyone was on big time," he says. "We backed him down from 33-
1 to 12-1 and then we ran out of money."
Such bold betting is down to the strength of the market, explains Gillespie. "Put on several thousand pounds at 
Cheltenham and a bookie doesn't flinch." Certainly, if you tried that on the average racecourse on a mid-season 
Saturday, you'd be lucky if he allowed you Pounds 100 each way.
For the average Cheltenham spectator, however, a fiver or tenner each way brings much the same thrill. It is not 
betting for a life-changing gain but purchasing an interest in the race, a brief share in "ownership", the right to roar 
on a particular set of colours, and to celebrate the victory afterwards.
If the racing doesn't change, the same is not true of the audience. Cheltenham, where the Festival was properly 
established in 1911, when the National Hunt Chase permanently came to rest there, was never as smart as Ascot. 
It was essentially the preserve of the green-wellies set. The horse was king and fashion didn't intrude. But the 
growth of the sport's Anglo-Irish rivalry since the 1960s, and the spreading of wealth through society are among the 
factors that have attracted owners and spectators from a far wider sphere. One ex-military owner described last 
year's Cheltenham as "the best all-ranks event around".
It's still the case that if ever they need a preservation park for the trilby and the Barbour, Cheltenham will provide it. 
For these people, the festival is proof that the English countryside, which they fear is about to disappear, has

survived another 12 months. However, the crowd is undeniably getting younger. There are more stretch limos 
rolling up alongside the four-wheel-
drives; more sharper-suited young men from the City cutting deals in the hospitality boxes. For, Michael O'Leary 
this accessibility is part of the Festival's appeal. Unlike some of the grander Flat meetings, he says, Cheltenham "is 
culturally different, there's none of the pomposity of Ascot".
Of the Festival's daily audience of around 55,000 people, a quarter come from Gloucestershire and nearby, another 
quarter from London and the Home Counties. Of the rest, 10,000 come from Ireland, and proceed to take over 
much of the Cotswolds countryside and its hostelries. Most of the top jockeys come from Ireland, too, including the 
irrepressible Paul Carberry. In hospital after a hunting accident before one recent Festival, Carberry was 
telephoned by trainer Noel Meade. "What did you break?" asked the trainer anxiously. "A gate," replied the jockey.
With Irish trainers tending to see the racing almost as a team event, a friendly but intense Anglo-Irish rivalry has 
become one of the essential ingredients of Cheltenham. Two years ago the Irish were jubilant when they won 10 of 
the 24 Cheltenham Festival races. They have won seven of the past nine Champion Hurdles, and conditions have 
been swinging in their favour.
The best jumping or "National Hunt" horses (Cheltenham is not coy about maintaining the historic link with hunting) 
are bred in Ireland. For decades the pick were sold on to English owners and breeders but, thanks to the recent 
boom in their economy, the Irish have been able to keep their best horses at home.
The Irish are among those who have taken the stretching of the festival since 2005, from three days to four to 
satisfy ticket demand, in their stride. They simply make a proper holiday of it. But some Cheltenham regulars, 
Edward Gillespie admits, have found it too much and started coming for only two days. With overall crowd figures 
up he is able to take the positive: "It means that more people get the opportunity to attend. We are broadening our 
base." But it is no surprise the average age is dropping. It takes stamina to live with the collective passion of the 
true jumping enthusiasts and Cheltenham can be a tough way of enjoying a day out. The bars struggle to cope, 
there are long queues for the loos and the wind that comes off Cleeve Hill can cut to the bone.
More seriously, some trainers have complained that Cheltenham has become too dominant. Not only is a 
disproportionate stable effort geared to four days in March but owners all want to run at the Festival with horses that 
might finish third or fourth at Cheltenham but which could easily have won a Pounds 20,000 first prize at a lesser 
track another day.
Unfortunately for them, a Cheltenham Festival winner is what owning hurdlers and steeplechasers is all about. And 
nothing better sums up both this, and the Festival's widespread appeal, than the ownership of Denman, the second 
favourite for this year's Gold Cup. The two men who share him are Paul Barber and Harry Findlay. Barber, a dairy 
farmer in his 60s, lives next door to the training yard he leases to champion trainer Paul Nicholls in Somerset and is 
an old-school tweedy countryman. Canny but shy and understated, he can go years without a bet.
For Barber, with a Gold Cup and a Champion Chase already under his belt, it is all about the horse and he has an 
unerring eye for potential. Findlay, 48, is a brash professional gambler who spends his day at home near Bath in 
front of a computer and bank of televisions gambling on tennis and football as well as horseracing. Racing crowds 
love his unbridled enthusiasm and the way he conducts the applause for Denman, the burly horse he calls "The 
Tank".
What unites the odd couple is a passion for top-class steeplechasers. This promises to be a vintage year for them 
and for the crowd as Denman, unbeaten over fences and the winner of this year's Hennessy Gold Cup, for the first 
time takes on last year's Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, the athletic Kauto Star, owned by Clive Smith. It is set to be 
the duel of the decade and, remarkably, the two star chasers occupy adjoining stalls in Nicholls' yard. This really is 
going to be a championship of Olympic proportions.

Dublin's ISEQ share index is headed towards its lowest level since May of 2005 as losses piled up to wipe almost 
E5 billion in the past week alone off already-reeling share prices.
Irish shares plummeted by 3pc on Thursday, wiping out Wednesday's brief rally following five sessions of decline, 
as a trading statement from Anglo Irish Bank's hit the wrong note with investors and sent the bank's shares 
plunging by some 9pc.
While the losses yesterday were smaller, the spiral downward continued yesterday as a constant stream of bad 
economic news overwhelmed any appetite Irish investors have for beleaguered stocks.
 Job figures dominated the news with the sharpest ever monthly drop in Ireland's Live Register compounded by a 
five-year fall in jobs figures from the US. The spike in jobless figures revealed by the CSO's Live Register figures 
was due in large part to the slowdown in construction, according to Davy Research with many tjhousands more jobs 
due to be shed in the sector before the year is out. Meanwhile, the US figures sent the euro soaring and the dollar 
falling to yet another record as the market sees the much heralded recession as having already arrived. Financial 
stocks edged up but failed to rally in Friday's trade with Anglo clawing back a fraction of its losses from Thursday 
with a 33c gain to E9.01. AIB shares declined by 8c to E12.96, Bank of Ireland edged up 14c to E9.01 and Irish Life 
and Permanent rose by 16c to E10.63. Banks are generally perceived as bellwether stocks reflecting the general 
state of health of the local and global economy and have been pulverised on both fronts in the past year, losing, on 
average close to half in value. Elsewhere, Jim Flavin-led DCC group was a major faller with stocks down 26c to 
E15.23 after it said it has snapped up another UK fuel distributor for nearly E10m. It has acquired Southern 
Counties Fuels Holdings, a long established oil business operating in the south east of England. However, the 
country's company law watchdog has intervened in the latest stage of the Fyffes-DCC court battle to suggest that 
disqualification may be considered. Fyffes shares gained 1c to E0.92. Shares in Aer Lingus were flat at E2.12 after 
the former State airline said passenger numbers were up by 15pc in February from the same month last year. 
ISEQ closes bad week on a low
However, the airline's load factor for the month fell sharply. Ryanair's shares dropped by 8c to E3.07 with both 
airline suffering from news that crude oil prices on the world market tipped a record USD106 a barrel yesterday and 
continued to stubbornly stay above the USD100 mark today. While Ryanair has vowed never to introduce fuel 
surcharges, Aer Lingus has done so on several occasions, especially on its long-haul routes and is likely to do so 
again this summer. There was yet more bad news for Irish building related stocks with the key UK merchanting 
market going through a rough patch. UK merchanting data for January were pretty dismal. According to the Builders 
Merchants Federation, sales volumes were down 9.1pc on January 2007. Volumes for the three months to the end 
of January were 8.8pc lower than the same three months in 2006/2007. Such a decline is the worst since the mid-
1990s and mirrors recent UK mortgage approvals data. From the point of view of the merchants, it is clear that the 
downward trend is accelerating. Shares in Grafton, which does nearly half its business in the UK, gained 15c to 
E5.25 as investors sought bargains.

Dublin ISEQ share index is headed to its lowest level since May of 2005 as losses this morning pile on top of falls 
this week that saw some E5 billion wiped off the value of shares.
By 11:00, the ISEQ was down 72.89 points to 6,109.33.
Irish shares plummeted yesterday, wiping out Wednesday's rally following five sessions of decline, as a trading 
statement from Anglo Irish Bank's hit the wrong note with investors and sent the bank's shares plunging by some

Inmarsat shrugged off concerns about an economic slowdown, but shares in the UK satellite communications 
company fell after its annual results disappointed some investors.
The company, which provides satellite telephony services to ships, aircraft and remote land locations, reported a 39 
per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Dollars 124.8m. But this fell short of heightened market expectations for the 
company, which has consistently outperformed forecasts since it listed three years ago.
Shares in the company fell 25 1/4p to 466 3/4p.
Analysts are concerned that the company faces higher capital expenditure costs this year, after bringing forward the 
launch of its next satellite to April. The launch adds an element of risk to the company.
Andrew Sukawaty, chief executive, said he had seen no slowdown in customer spending and expected the 
company to resist a downturn. A large proportion of its sales come from government and military clients.
He maintained the company's long-term forecast of 6 per cent to 8 per cent annual growth to 2010. Market 
expectations of 9 per cent revenue growth in 2008 were "challenging but achievable", he said.
Revenues for 2007 rose 15.3 per cent to Dollars 576.5m, as more ships bought its data services such as satellite 
internet connections. Shipping makes up about 55 per cent of sales and Inmarsat is selling more sophisticated 
services to the sector.
Aeronautical sales grew 44 per cent as private jets and government aircraft signed up for on-board internet. The 
company will benefit when airlines such as Ryanair start to offer inflight calls. These revenues are unlikely to be 
significant before next year.
Inmarsat also plans to launch globally a hand-held satellite phone at the end of this year. It will retail at about 
Dollars 500, half the current market price, and Inmarsat is hoping to have 10 per cent of that market by 2010.

Earnings per share fell from 28 cents to 21 cents. The final dividend is raised 8.3 per cent to 17.33 cents for a total 
of 28.88 cents (26.66 cents).

F&C Investments' Pounds 48m (Dollars 95.7m) Emerging Markets Fund is a concentrated portfolio of "best ideas". 
It invests globally across 30 to 40 different stocks, each typically about 3 per cent of the fund.
The starting point for choosing holdings is thematic - with key plays currently being oil and gas, and infrastructure - 
rather than country allocations.
Brazil - which recently became the biggest emerging stock market - does have the highest country weighting at 18 
per cent of the fund. But this is a function of favoured individual stock picks rather than benchmarking, says 
manager Jeff Chowdry.
Chowdhry, who has looked after the fund since June 2006, says that the "high conviction" portfolio is also run with 
disciplines including stop-losses set at 15 per cent below purchase prices.
"The principle is we run winners and cut losers," he says, adding that in some cases holding periods can be as 
short as one month.
The oil and gas theme, rather than simply being about high energy prices, is really about the ability of emerging 
market companies to increase production, he says. Emerging market companies often have preferential rights in 
their local markets where discoveries are being made.
Favoured stocks include Petrobas of Brazil, which is the fund's biggest holding, and Novatek, Russia's number two 
player after Gazprom. Novatek is set to benefit from domestic price increases of 25 per cent annually over the next 
three years in Russia, says Chowdhry.
Infrastructure is about the pressing need for roads, power plants and so on in many emerging markets. Historically 
these countries didn't have the money to invest, but many now have oil wealth which can be used in what could be 
a "generation-long" transformation.
Chowdhry says he looks for infrastructure companies with a competitive advantage. Current holdings including 
Russia's Evraz Group, the leading long-steel and construction materials producer, which is self-sufficient in key raw 
F&C themes prove decisive
materials such as iron ore and coking coal. Another is Orascom Construction, the biggest building group in the 
Middle East.
By contrast, he is avoiding exporters, preferring businesses geared to domestic growth than those under threat from 
weakening demand in developed markets. This aversion extends to the technology sector, including the Indian 
software industry which is exposed to the slowing US economy.
Chowdhry says that while emerging markets will continue to be buffeted by developed market turmoil, there is also 
evidence of their "outperforming on the way up" during periods of investment stability. He thinks opportunities could 
lie among Middle Eastern companies, an area many global emerging market funds have little exposure. The fund 
has just invested in Air Arabia, the largest low-cost airline in the region. "It's where Ryanair was 10 years ago," he 
says.
Emerging market banks, many of which have been sold down because of perceived exposure to US sub-prime 
problems, could also be an area for investment in the next six months.

The Dutch Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transport are looking into the possibility to adjust flight taxes to 
suit the length of a flight and the type of aircraft used, newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad reported.
The ministries held talks with the aviation sector last week about the matter, a spokesman from the Ministry of 
Finance told the FD.
The spokesman added that Finance State Secretary Jan Kees de Jager will unveil the results of the discussions in 
May. If the flight tax is adjusted, the changes will implemented with the new tax oplan in 2009, the newspaper 
reported.
The Dutch government decided last year to put an environmental tax on airline tickets: 11.25 eur per flight for 
European destinations less than 2,500 kilometres and 45 eur for longer flights.
But Amsterdam airport Schiphol Group, the Dutch travel bureau association ANVR, the Board of Airline 
Representatives in the Netherlands (Barin), Ryanair Holdings PLC and Maastricht Aachen Airport have launched 
legal proceedings against the Dutch state to prevent the introduction of the tax.
The organisations claim the flight tax will not yield the Dutch government's desired environmental benefits and is in 
violation with European law and contradicts international aviation agreements signed by the Netherlands.
A court in The Hague will deliberate over the case today.

Weaker investment returns and falling insurance premiums conspired to send pre-tax profits at insurers, FBD, 
tumbling to E162.2m in 2007 compared to E296.8m the previous year.
FBD said its full-year pre-tax profit fell largely due to short term fluctuations in investment returns, while underwriting 
profit declined as expected due to lower margins resulting from premium reductions.
Adjusted operating profit fell to E127.9m from E158.5mr a year earlier, mostly on a reduction in the return on the 
group's capital fund.
 FBD posted revenue of E567.4m against E693.9m a year earlier. Net earned premiums amounted to E350.3m 
versus E346.0m a year earlier. It had gross written premiums of E407.9m from E407.2m. FBD said that price 
reductions have continued this year. It questioned the sustainability of such pricing, however, given the cost/income 
ratios that insurers are reporting. 'It is the widespread view of industry analysts, however, that the downward trend 
is about to be reversed,' FBD said. The company said it has implemented single-digit price increases on some 
products where ratios warranted rate changes. 'While this action has impacted growth policy, we do not regard 
increasing our customer numbers at uneconomic premium levels as a viable option, it said. FBD also said that the 
challenges facing its leisure, property and financial services businesses faced in 2007 have continued into 2008. On 
the property/leisure front, the company said that oversupply of product in the marketplace is the key challenge 
facing our businesses, both in Ireland and in Spain. In its financial services division, FBD said it is developing new 
market segments to overcome lower commercial premium levels (FBD Brokers) and the difficult investment climate 
(FBD Life). Recently, FBD launched a new stand-alone car insurance brand, aimed at the budget market. The 'No 
Nonsense Car Insurance' product is an internet only offering and is being marketed in conjunction with Ryanair 
Money. 'We delivered another strong performance in the year under review,' commented FBD Holding's EO Philip 
Fitzsimons.

Operating earnings per share came in at 316c a share for 2007, down on the previous year, but ahead of analysts'

The figure also excluded a one-off 108m euro boost due to a xgange in its reserving policy.
 The money is expected to be returned to shareholders as a special dividend, analyst Anna Lalor of Goodbody

forecasts. Its growth was driven by its ingredients business, while consumer food and agribusiness profits were 
down. Its shares were trading 18c higher at 510 shortly before lunch. Other Dublin movers this morning included

From Mr Michael O'Leary.
Sir, The sacking of Stephen Nelson from the BAA monopoly, and his replacement with another regulatory "gamer" 
brought in from a water utility, is about as useful as changing the captain of the Titanic. It's not the leadership but 
the structure that is the problem.
The London airports don't work simply because they are a Spanish-owned monopoly that ignores its customer 
airlines, builds facilities we don't want, wastes money on a vast scale in order to inflate its future income and is 
overseen by a weak and ineffective regulatory regime, run by a bunch of well-meaning but incompetent bureaucrats 
in the Civil Aviation Authority, who have sat idly by for many years and allowed customers to be stuck in queues, 
delayed and ripped off at every turn.
Since the CAA's regulatory regime does not work, the obvious solution to this mess is to break up the BAA airport 
monopoly. Spin off the three London airports as separate, competing entities and allow competition between those 
airports to develop efficient additional capacity and to deliver lower passenger costs and improved passenger 
services. Let competition replace the deadbeat bureaucrats and the regulatory rigor mortis that so blight the lives of 
airlines and passengers at the London airports today.
Monopolies screw their customers. Regulators get captured by the monopolies they are supposed to regulate. 
Airline competition has delivered lower fares and improved services in the UK for the past 20 years. Isn't it time we 
let competition between the London airports do the same? Let us not delude ourselves that the latest change of 
captain on the Titanic that is the BAA monopoly will make any difference whatsoever.

France continues 2008 where it left of f in previous years, as Ireland's favourite overseas property investment 
location.
You can expect to see a raft of new developments aimed at the Irish market as it is one of the few areas which has 
maintained a strong Irish investor base.
Paris has become a firm favourite with Irish property investors as well as tourists. Access is extremely good from all 
main Irish airports, even to Beauvais with Ryanair if you fancy a bus drive to the city. It is also a pretty short flight so 
it is a favoured 'long weekend' destination.
For those looking more toward an investment in the Paris region, Springvale Overseas is offering an opportunity to 
purchase in Nova Park, a business residence with 113 apartments and 33 covered car park spaces. The property 
will feature lifts to all floors and the garage, a luggage room, reception area and disabled access facilities.
Te r e n c e O'Mahony of Springvale said the residence is ideal for short to medium-term occupancy. The central 
Paris region of Ile de France is the country's foremost centre of economic activity. La Defense, the largest purpose-
built business district in Europe, hosts the head offices of almost half of the major French companies, as well as the 
headquarters of ten of the world's largest companies. It is generally regarded as one of the world's four major cities.
The apartments come fully furnished with televisions and electric heating. Kitchens are fully fitted with dishwasher, 
fridge, vitro-ceramic hob, microwave, china and crockery.
Bathrooms come fully fitted and furnished with shower/ bath and fan radiators, cupboards and shelves. The 
residences will contain a sofa, secured entrance doors and double glazing.
The rental on these units is paid quarterly in advance and the purchase is without Vat, which is being prepaid by the 
developer. The leaseback income is index-linked and, as they are business residences there is no self-occupancy.
Irish investors continue love affair with French investment
O'Mahony said this is a tax efficient investment vehicle with amortisation over 30 years for income tax purposes and 
mortgage payments deductible against rental income. Rent is reviewed every year and there are no penalty 
charges for cancelling the lease after the first lease term.
The yield is from 4.34 to 4.83 per cent, index linked with a renewable lease length of 11 years, 11 months. Prices 
are from  150,927 to  193,232 including furniture.
Springvale will be showcasing this leaseback at a private exhibition in the Westin Hotel, College Green, Dublin 
2,today from 12 to 6pm.
For those looking at property on France's Mediterranean coast, the Languedoc Roussillon region of the south of 
France is growing a strong Irish fan base. The area is renowned for its Mediterranean resorts, high mountains, 
close proximity to skiing in the Pyrenees and especially its vineyards.
A few years ago you could hardly reach the area. Over the past two years, however, the Languedoc's airports have 
been in collaboration with a number of low cost airlines, including Ryanair, to service its five airports in 
Carcassonne, Toulouse, Perpignan, Nimes and Montpellier.
By 2009 the TGV (Train a' Grande Vitesse - France's high speed rail service) will operate the Barcelona to 
Perpignan route, carved through the rock of the Pyrenees, shortening the journey of 2 hours 45 minutes to a mere 
50 minutes. It is anticipated that property demand from Barcelona will increase dramatically as property prices are 
much higher than in this part of the south of France.
Prices in the Languedoc have risen sharply in recent years, but they come in a great deal lower than the traditional 
hotspots of the neighbouring Riviera. ''The cost per square metre along the Riviera is nearly  5,000, but Languedoc 
has yet to rise to  3,000," said Ciaran Mannion of Overseas Properties.
The Carcassonne region offers increasing opportunities for Irish investors, according to Mannion, due to the 
increased flight access and three vineyards in the region which are in the late stages of development plans for 
international golf courses.
''Golf is in its infancy in the Languedoc," said Mannion. ''The new courses should bring enhanced tourist 
opportunities." Some 16 kilometres northeast, or 20 minutes by car from Carcassonne, the firm has launched a 
development in the rustic village of Villeneuve Minervois. The village is known for its truffles and wine from the two 
local vineyards - Chateau Des Chanoines and Cellier Lauran Caberet. Local farmers provide produce like 
farmhouse cheese and foie gras.
Carcassonne Golf is a hamlet of 27 traditional villas. Each villa includes three bedrooms, three bathrooms and a 
private pool. One of the luxury golf and spa resorts planned for the area is 20 minutes from the development.
Mannion estimates these properties can achieve a weekly rental income of over  400 in low season and  735 during 
peak. Prices in this development range from  255,000 to  285,000.

Ben Dunne's online shop to compete with family

Businessman Ben Dunne is investing an initial  1 million in his new online venture, bendunnedirect.com, putting him 
in competition with his family's Dunnes Stores.
Dunne hopes to have the website up and running by September, selling a range of products from suits to bed linen, 
jewellery and toys. He said the site would undercut traditional retailers and should have a similar effect to Ryanair, 
whose online sales slashed airline ticket prices.
Bendunnedirect.com will not sell food items, but will focus on products where Dunne sees traditional retailers have 
a large profit margin. ''There is a huge business in suits in this country, but they are all made in China and the 
stores have huge margins. I'll halve the prices," he said.
Dunne, who ran the Dunnes Stores business until the early 1990s, admitted that selling online was ''not retail the 
way I'm used to retail''. However, he has novel ideas for getting around the fact that internet consumers can't touch 
the products they want to buy.
''When you're buying online, you'll always wonder 'will the jacket fit?"' said Dunne. ''My sizes will be very similar to 
Dunnes, so you can go into Dunnes and try it on, get your size and buy it online from me. I'm the only online retailer 
with a fitting room in every town in Ireland. That's the way I'm thinking and there's no law against it."
He sees other niche opportunities, such as scented candles, which are ''a huge business in this country''. However, 
bendunnedirect.com will only sell vanilla-scented candles, because consumers won't be able to smell them before 
they buy.
Other products the site is likely to stock include low-energy light bulbs, cutlery and gifts. ''I have a good reputation 
for quality and value,'' Dunne said.
Ben Dunne's online shop to compete with family
''At the minute, the only reason people go online [to shop] is for convenience. But if the customer gets value, it will 
take off like wildfire. I like things to grow and that's what this new business is all about. And if it fails, well, I was 
never afraid of failure."
Dunne has been working on the online project for more than a year and will start off with one warehouse to store 
products. ''If it grows, fantastic," he said.
''At the beginning, the investment is no more than  1 million, but there are all sorts of opportunities after that. 
Somebody might want to link into me or we might get into the UK market as a discounter. I'd be known by the Irish 
community in the UK."
It is understood that Dunne has hired an Irish web development firm, but some work on the site will be outsourced 
to India. Dunne said he had ''no problem getting really good people'' to work for the business.
''I don't think a Dunnes or Penneys buyer would be any good to me, though," he said.
Dunne said that his fitness club business was trading well, with 30,000 visits a week to his three gyms in Dublin. 
''More people visit my three gyms than go to the races every year in Ireland - 1.5 million people go to the races and 
I get more than that in the gyms."
He said he was keen to expand the gym business, but it was difficult to get sites for development. ''If Ryanair wants 
to expand, it can buy a plane and expand, but getting sites is not that easy."

Ruinair. By Paul Kilduff. Gill & Macmillan,  13
Lest any reader miss the intended target of the pun in the title of Ruinair, Paul Kilduff's sub-title might yield a hint: 
How to be Treated Like Shite in 15 Countries and Still Quite Like It. A further clue could be gleamed from the price 
tag: ''Only e0.01* (*price excludes fees and charges of  12.98)."
The final clue for slow learners might be the gleaming grin of Michael O'Leary, whose pearls of wisdom and 
invective course (and curse) so much throughout this book, that it could be re-titled Michael's Little Red Book.
We live in an age of comedy travelogues based around a gimmick - and I mean gimmick in no pejorative sense, but 
the sense of finding some daft prospective from which to come at the familiar world from a new angle. Pete 
McCarthy perfected it in McCarthy's Bar.
Comedians have hitch-hiked around Ireland with a fridge or tried to play tennis against the entire Moldovan football 
squad (tried, because the Moldovans were too preoccupied with trying to survive to engage in sport).The respected 
soccer writer, Charlie Connelly, penned his wonderfully restrained Stamping Grounds after following Liechtenstein 
on their quest to qualify for the World Cup.
The human brain is primed to formulate book ideas when in transit, and especially so when that transport is 
delayed. It was while travelling on a train that JK Rowling came up with the notion of writing seven Harry Potter 
novels - she might only have conceived five of them had the train not been delayed for four hours. One can only 
imagine what she would have invented if delayed for ten hours, as happened to Dubliner Kilduff when he attempted 
to fly home from Malaga airport.
What made this experience extra memorable - apart from receiving no information from ground staff as to what was 
happening, and finally having to scramble onto a clapped-out replacement aircraft (with signs in German), amid 
drunk passengers allowed to board with their own beer, was that Kilduff had paid through the nose for the 
How flying without frills can be fun
experience -  300 plus taxes. A letter of complaint yielded a standard reply couched in a vague language, which 
Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, has termed ''bollixology''.
Kilduff's response was not to get angry, but to get even. How better to do so than to take Ryanair at its word and fly 
everywhere for virtually nothing, plus taxes? For the same price as he paid for his flight home from Spain, Kilduff 
crisscrossed Europe to every European country to which Ryanair flies. Cue months of herding, early starts and 
arrivals in the most unlikely terminals, situated vast distances from the cities they are said to serve.
Venice sounds glamorous, but as Kilduff explains in another letter to Ryanair, Venice's Treviso airport involved 
waiting ''in a filthy departure lounge with bad lighting, broken floors and filthy seats . . . two of the four urinals are out 
of order. There are several telephone booths but the telephones have been removed."
Ryanair responded with more restrained bollixology. But the book is ablaze with less restrained quotes from their 
chief executive, such as: ''Sometimes there is not even a road to the airports we fly to." Or his views on in-flight 
gambling: ''A lot of people are, frankly, bored on flights . . .we might have the pilots calling out the bingo numbers." 
Or on personal popularity: ''I don't give a shite if nobody likes me . . . I'm probably just an obnoxious little bollix. Who 
cares? The purpose is not to be loved. The purpose is to have passengers on board."
Balanced against this are reports of passengers finding themselves being bussed from Paris to Madrid, of trying to 
get their children off planes after sitting for six hours on runways without food or water and getting arrested for their 
pains, about a paraplegic granny in a wheelchair left abandoned by a Ryanair crew in an inch of snow, or another 
pensioner with a paralysed leg having to drag herself up the steps of a plane because staff refused to help.
There is no better comfort read than another person's apoplexy, and Kilduff has a neat sense of irony when 
balancing his own and other people's tales of discomfort, with the motivation that brings us all back to Ryanair: it's 
cheap. He can be a droll and perceptive writer, though his humour works best when not top heavy (the chummy 
''Ruinair'' for Ryanair, ''yo-yo'' for euro and ''O'Leery'' for O'Leary merely get annoying with repetition).
However, his dispatches from the hot-spots of Liechtenstein (where 30 per cent of the population emigrate every 
morning) or San Marino (where he refuses to enter the Torture museum, because the iron chair reminds him too 
much of a Ryanair seat) are witty and engaging. A quirky study of a modern phenomenon, Ruinair is the ultimate 
airport book.
You may even see it sold on Ryanair flights, if O'Leary can find some way to make a buck from it.

State-owned airports including Dublin, Cork and Shannon could be allowed to offer 'sweetener deals' to attract new 
business if Ryanair wins its appeal against a European Commission decision later this month.
Four years ago, the commission ruled that the state-owned Charleroi airport in Belgium was not entitled to offer 
Ryanair incentives which constituted illegal state aid. Ryanair asked the European Court of First Instance to annul 
the decision, and the appeal will be heard on March 12.Thelegal team is being advised by solicitor Dr Vincent 
Power of A&L Goodbody.
In 2001,theWalloon regional government in Belgium offered Ryanair a range of financial incentives to set up a base 
at Brussels South Charleroi Airport (BSCA),which it managed on a 50-year lease. The regional government agreed 
to slash Ryanair landing charges to approximately  104 for Boeing 737200s and  151 for 737-800s, compared with 
the usual rates of about  250 and  390.
The Walloon Minister for Transport guaranteed to compensate Ryanair for losses due to any changes in airport 
taxes or opening hours until 2016. BSCA also offered the airline  250,000 towards hotel costs and staff subsistence;  
160,000 for each new route, up to a maximum of  1,920,000;  768,000 for recruiting and training pilots and crews;  
4,000 for office equipment; free office space; an engineering store and a maintenance hangar.
Ryanair would be charged just  1 per passenger for ground handling services - one tenth of the price paid by other 
users. Ryanair and BSCA also formed a joint company to finance Ryanair's publicity and marketing in relation to 
Charleroi. In return, Ryanair undertook to base between two and four aircraft at the airport and to operate at least 
three daily round trips per aircraft for 15 years. Details of the deal were not published.
Before Ryanair set up at Charleroi, only 20,000 passengers a year used the airport - an average of 55 a day. By 
2000, Ryanair was carrying 178,000 passengers on the Charleroi Dublin route. The volume of traffic increased by 
1,455 per cent between 1997 and 2002,with Charleroi handling more than 1.25 million passengers - almost 4,000 a 
day - to ten European destinations in 2002.
Ryanair wants more 'sweet' deals
According to Ryanair, the BSCA deal would create 4,235 additional jobs by 2010 and bring in  243 million in airport 
taxes by 2015. But following a complaint about the terms of the confidential deal, the European Commission 
launched a two-year investigation. Supporters of Ryanair told the commission that it was normal for airports to do 
deals with airlines to increase passenger volumes and generate significant income.
The owners of Prestwick airport near Glasgow told the commission that, when that airport was sold by the British 
Airport Authority in 1992, only 1 per cent of its capacity was being used. In 1994, Prestwick signed a 15-year deal 
with Ryanair for two daily flights between Glasgow and Dublin. In the first year, 114,000 passengers were carried 
on the route. Since then, Ryanair had started other routes from Prestwick and predicted that it would carry 1.7 
million passengers by 2003.
But Ryanair's competitors took a different view. Britannia Airline said that, while it was normal for airports to provide 
marketing support and price cuts to increase business, the benefits must be proportional, realistic and limited in 
duration. Dutch airline KLM said the advantages received by Ryanair at Charleroi went well beyond what was 
permitted under European law.
Air France said the commercial and regulatory environment was never rigid, so the Belgian airport's compensation 
guarantee gave Ryanair an unfair advantage. Austrian Airlines said the arrangement at Charleroi led to ''significant 
distortion of competition between airlines ''and was ''largely incompatible with the smooth operation of the internal 
aviation market''.
A local residents' association said it was concerned about the increase in traffic and the ''questionable government 
aid granted to a private company, as this involves improper use of the Walloon region's budgetary resources''.
In February 2004, the commission decided that part of the aid package was illegal under common market rules. It 
said the airport's decision to cut airport taxes for one airline on all flights for 15 years - in an agreement that was 
given no publicity and deviated from the law - amounted to a tax exemption. The compensation guarantee also 
allowed Ryanair to operate immune from commercial risk. These measures, which came from state resources, were 
likely to distort competition and intra-community trade, so could be considered state aid.
It ruled that cuts in the cost of landing charges and ground handling services went beyond the discounts set out in 
the official tariff of the Walloon government and were incompatible with the common market. It ordered the Belgian 
government to recover the subsidies - estimated at more than  4 million - and to scrap the compensation 
guarantees.
The commission decided that other types of aid granted by BSCA, including 'one-shot' incentives and provision of 
office space, were permissible as start-up aid, but must be limited to five years after the opening of a new route. It 
said total aid for any new route must never exceed half of the start-up, marketing and one-shot costs. Contributions 
paid for the Dublin-Charleroi route under the November 2001 contracts were to be repaid.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said the decision was ''a disaster for consumers and for low cost air fares'' 
and meant that publicly-owned airports could no longer compete with private airports in Europe. Last December, 
Ryanair announced five new routes from Charleroi to Bergerac, Limoges, Perpignan, Porto and Zaragoza.
This summer, the airline says it will operate 26 routes to and from Charleroi, carrying more than 2.5million 
passengers. Ryanair said its partnership with BSCA had transformed Charleroi ''from an empty, loss-making white 
elephant into a profitable, thriving, wealth generator''.
''The huge success of the BSCA's low-cost agreement with Ryanair exposes the stupidity of the EU's unlawful 
decision at Charleroi," said O'Leary. ''We look forward to the European Court of First Instance forcing the European 
Commission to end their discrimination by addressing the real and repeated breaches of state aid to flag carriers 
which they have ignored for the past two years."

Union will commence the initial round of negotiations for the second stage of the open-skies agreement in May in 
Ljubljana, Slovenia, which holds the chairmanship of the open-skies consultative commission. 
The first open-skies agreement comes into effect at the end of March. The US and Australia have concluded a 
bilateral open-skies agreement that will expand and liberalize the aviation market between the two countries. It 
abolishes all restrictions on US and Australian air services for carriers of both countries.  Market observers see this 
development as ending a duopoly on the US-Australia route held by Qantas - which controls about 75% of the 
market share on the route - and United Airlines.  The deal will allow Australian carrier Virgin Blue to begin flights to 
the US by the end of the year - but leaves Singapore Airlines, which has long coveted the route, still without 
access.  This agreement, and open-skies agreements in general, represent a market-oriented approach to aviation 
relations, whereby airlines, not governments, will decide which cities to serve, the frequency of flights, the 
equipment used and the prices charged. n 
The US has concluded 90 open-skies agreements. The Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation 
Safety Agency have approved cross-crew qualification for pilots of all Airbus next-generation fly-by-wire family 
aircraft. The latest approval concerns the 13-day transition from A320 to the A380. 
Cross-crew qualification is reduced pilot transition training, which allows carriers to cross-qualify pilots to operate 
certain aircraft, thereby reducing training costs. The cross-crew qualification system allows A320-family pilots to 
qualify for the A380 in 13 days. A French court has held that Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair improperly used a picture 
of French president Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife, Carla Bruni, in an advertisement, and ordered the carrier to pay 
?60,001 ($89,300) in damages. 
President Sarkozy sought and was awarded a symbolic ?1 in damages, while his wife sought ?500,000 in damages 
- what she claimed to receive for appearing in advertisements - and was awarded ?60,000.

The pound fell to an all-time low against the euro today as sagging consumer sentiment and falling house prices 
boosted expectations that the Bank of England will soon cut interest rates.
With the US expected to cut rates at its next Fed meeting, the disparity in base interest rates is seeing a major 
outflow from both the dollar and sterling in to the euro and in to so-called safe haven currencies such as the Swiss 
Franc.
The rise in the value of the euro against the pound is bad news for many of Ireland's top companies such as 
Ryanair, Kingspan and Grafton Group, who do much of their business in sterling but report in euros.
 Meanwhile, British consumer morale fell to its lowest in more than 13 years in February, a survey showed on 
Thursday, as people grew more gloomy about the economy than any time since the recession of the early 1990s, a

chance earlier in the week. This morning, the euro touched 76.54 pence, its highest since the single currency's 
inception in 1999 and up 4 percent since the start of the year. The pound eased 0.2 percent against the dollar

Iberia posted fourth-quarter net profit of €104.6 million ($155US.6 million) thanks to cost controls and more efficient 
fuel consumption, the Spanish airline said Wednesday.
Spain's No. 1 airline by sales had a net loss of €9.4 million ($14US million) in the same period a year earlier.
Operating costs were unchanged during the fourth quarter of 2007 at €1.33 billion ($1US.98 billion), as Iberia's fleet 
renewal improved fuel efficiency. Fuel-related expenses were also flat during the same comparative period at 
€317.9 million ($472US.8 million).
Iberia has lowered operational costs, focusing on long-haul flights and domestic routes that feed passengers for its 
trans-Atlantic flights. The restructuring of its network model, centered on its new hub in Madrid, took place after its 
profitability came under pressure from low-fare airlines easyJet and Ryanair. Both companies boosted operations in 
Spain and are now offering domestic flights.
Iberia has also enhanced business-class services to widen profit margins.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose 2.3 percent to €1.4 billion ($2US.1 billion).
Late last year, Iberia's leading shareholder, Spanish savings bank Caja Madrid, raised its stake in the carrier to 23 
percent and disrupted an approach from code-share partner British Airways and U.S. private equity firm TPG. They 
had presented an indicative offer that valued Iberia at €3.4 billion ($5US.1 billion), or €3.60 ($5US.35) per share.
Iberia's shares have been punished since then, losing 21 percent of their value this year.
They were up 0.4 percent early Tuesday at €2.38 ($3US.54).
With more than €2 billion ($2US.97 billion) in cash and little debt, Iberia is now seeking to become a predator. It 
recently filed a bid for Spanair, the loss-making local unit of Scandinavian carrier SAS, as part of an effort to 
consolidate its grip on short-haul flights feeding its new terminal at Barajas airport.

Low-fares airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said it has filed a complaint with the European Commission against the

Ryanair alleges the aid is being granted by the Dutch government in the form of an exemption of transfer 
passengers from a so-called 'ECO-TAX' on air travel.
'While Schiphol is effectively the only Dutch airport handling transfer passengers, Air France-KLM accounts for 95 
pct of the transfer traffic at the airport. This tax exemption is almost exclusively benefiting Schiphol and the Air 
France-KLM monopoly,' Jim Callaghan, Ryanair's head of regulatory affairs said in a statement.
Ryanair claims that in Sept 2007 the Dutch Council of State confirmed it should have been notified to the European

The Irish airline Aer Lingus announced a deal Wednesday to buy four more aircraft from European maker Airbus.
Aer Lingus said the A320-200 aircraft would be delivered by 2011, when the airline plans to have an all-Airbus fleet 
of 39 short-haul jets.
Chief Executive Dermot Mannion called the new planes "key to our growth ambitions."
Aer Lingus said it received a confidential discount off the total list price of $226US.8 million (€151.2 million).

Irish airline Aer Lingus said Wednesday it is buying four more jets from European maker Airbus.
Aer Lingus said the A320-200 aircraft would be delivered by 2011, when the airline plans to have an all-Airbus fleet 
of 39 short-haul jets.
Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion called the new planes "key to our growth ambitions."
The airline said it received a confidential discount off the total list price of $226.8 million.
Aer Lingus faces stiff competition from its Dublin-based rival, Ryanair, the biggest no-frills airline in Europe. Ryanair

Ryanair has complained to the EU commission over an 'eco-tax' exemption for transfer passengers granted to 
KLM/Air France and Schipol Airport by the Dutch government.
Ryanair claims the exemption amounts to a 'massive subsidy' in the region of EUR400 million for the airport and the 
airlines.
Company spokesman Jim Callaghan said in a statement: "While Schiphol is effectively the only Dutch airport 
handling transfer passengers, KLM/Air France accounts for 95% of the transfer traffic at the airport."
 "This tax exemption is almost exclusively benefiting Schiphol and the KLM/Air France monopoly. The Dutch 
Council of State in September 2007 confirmed that it should have been notified to the European Commission as 
State aid." Ryanair has accused to commission of failing to act on its earlier complaints about alleged state aid to 
Air France, Alitalia, Olympic, Lufthansa and Volare.

allowing Ryanair.com to return to business.
On Friday, Ryanair, which takes 90 pct of bookings through its website, said it was closing its website until late on 
Monday for 'essential system upgrade works'.
The shutdown allowed it to bring its website into line with an Office of Fair Trading demand to remove misleading

Ireland 's air traffic controllers postpone strike threat

Ireland's air traffic controllers postponed their threat Monday to shut airports nationwide, but pressed on with their 
demands for more staff and better overtime pay.
Approximately 300 air traffic controllers had voted to walk off their jobs Thursday if the Irish Aviation Authority did 
not promise to raise their overtime benefits and hire more controllers.
The controllers, however, agreed to postpone their strike threat until court-brokered talks concluded, after 
negotiations opened Monday at the Labor Court in Dublin.
It was not immediately clear whether the controllers also would resume doing overtime duty. All three major Irish 
airports in recent weeks have suffered short-term shutdowns and other disruption when controllers refused to work 
overtime to cover ill or absent co-workers.
Air traffic staff accuse the authority of failing to hire any new controllers since 2001, forcing existing workers into 
excessively long hours. The Irish Aviation Authority denies both allegations.
The authority says the three major airports in Ireland in Dublin, Cork and Shannon would be forced to shut if air 
traffic controllers walk off the job. It says Ireland also would close its airspace to overflights of aircraft traveling 
between Europe and North America.
The authority has ruled out the possibility of drafting in managers and military personnel to keep the airports open.
Both sides accepted an invitation from the Labor Court, a government-appointed panel tasked with resolving 
industrial disputes. Monday's talks at the Labor Court headquarters in Dublin were expected to run into nighttime.
If the controllers strike, the Irish Aviation Authority warns it would ground an estimated 450 flights carrying more 
than 60,000 travelers a day.
Both sides have refused to comment on what specific financial demands the controllers are making.
Ireland 's air traffic controllers postpone strike threat
Ryanair, the budget airline that refuses to recognize unions, has claimed that the controllers currently have a 34.7-
hour work week and are paid on average 140,000 euros ($210,000) a year; want 15 percent pay raises simply for 
accepting their continued availability for overtime duty; and 1,200 euros ($1,800) in extra pay for each overtime shift 
worked.

A Dublin broker has slashed its earnings forecast for Cavan-based building insulations group, Kingspan, for the 
second time.
It sees the company joining Bank of
Ireland, DCC and Ryanair as casualties of the sterling slump.
The market is now braced for a second warning from Kingspan chief executive, Gene Murtagh, as the company 
feels the effects of the fall in the pound. Over the past six months the market have seen the value of the euro 
against pound rise from under 68p to close at almost 75.5p by last Friday. Kingspan, along with fellow Irish Stock 
Exchange listed stalwarts such as Ryanair, Abbey and DCC, conducts much of its total business in the UK but 
reports in euros, taking a significat hit to its bottom line from the slide in the pound's fortunes as well as the levelling 
off of building activity there. Davy, Kingspan's own broker, has slashed its full-year 2008 earnings forecast by 29pc 
with the price target now down to E9.28 a share, just 13c above its closing price of E9.25 on Friday.

"Our new, improved booking engine will enable us to welcome millions of additional passengers as we double in

The website refurbishment was also undertaken in order to comply with a ruling by Britain's Office of Fair Trading

 "On Tuesday, Ryanair will release 1 million seats for just 1p inclusive of taxes and charges, proving the OFT and

Late bid to avert air traffic chaos

Length: 348 words
Body
The Labour Court is expected to ask air traffic controllers to cancel or suspend their planned strike on Thursday, 
when controllers' representatives meet the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) tomorrow.
More than 70,000 passengers would be affected by an all-out strike, and business, tourism and travel associations 
have already condemned the threatened action. For talks between union Impact and the IAA to progress tomorrow, 
it is expected the Labour Court will ask that the strike threat be removed.
Flights at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports have been affected by intermittent unofficial action in the last four 
weeks, when controllers refused to work overtime or do sick cover.
The controllers, who number fewer than 300 but perform vital flight control at Ireland's three main airports, want 
new controllers recruited, a regularised system of overtime and increased overtime pay. However, industry sources 
have indicated an increased overtime pay-off alone would be rejected.
The Sunday Business Post understands that controllers currently earn around  1,000 for one overtime shift of six or 
eight hours - which is double pay - but are seeking to have this increased to as much as  1,650.
Impact communications officer Niall Shanahan said recent figures released by Ryanair and Ibec in relation to the 
controllers earnings were ''not correct'' and were deflecting attention from a staff shortage of controllers.
The IAA has recruited an extra 72 trainee controllers, but it will be July next year before the first 36 of these take up 
positions.
''We are focusing on engaging with the Labour Court and I'm sure both sides will work extensively to avert a strike," 
Shanahan said.
Late bid to avert air traffic chaos
Meanwhile, last ditch talks between Aer Lingus management and Siptu continued yesterday, after the national 
carrier threatened to implement cost-cutting work practices this week and suspend staff who will not comply. Staff 
are resisting the new practices.
The changes include shifts of differing lengths, working full shifts, changing from one area to another during shifts 
and extension of available flexi-time hours.

Irish banks were lower this morning after international credit watchdog Fitch Ratings warned that the amount of

At 11.20am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 101.55 points at 6396.98
The Irish Central Bank has published the sectoral split for lending in Q4.
 It shows a slowdown in property-related lending in the final months of 2007. Construction lending rose by 24.9pc 
year-on-year (yoy), down from 48.5pc yoy only 12 months ago. Growth in Q4 was just 3.3pc. Growth in real estate 
lending was 27.7pc yoy, while growth in Q4 was a surprisingly strong 7.1pc, suggesting that the credit crunch had 
not really affected draw-downs yet. Meanwhile mortgage lending-we had this already-ended the year up 13.5pc yoy 
with growth in Q4 running at 3pc. In aggregate, lending to these sectors rose by 4.2pc in Q4. Property lending in its 
three forms accounted for E246 billion at the end of 2007 (commercial real estate and construction accounts for 
E105.8 billion of this), which represented 63pc of all private sector credit outstanding (E392bn). Property accounted 
for 62pc of the increase in credit during 2007, down from 82pc 12 months earlier Banks drove the index lower. In 
the banking sector, Bank of Ireland was down 15c to 9.35 and AIB fell 13c to 13.67, Anglo Irish Bank was down 16c 
to 8.69 and Irish Life and Permanent slipped 13c to 10.08. Construction shares followed suit. CRH was down 17c to 
25.78 and Grafton fell 2c to 5.41, McInerney was flat at 1.57 and Kingspan was down 5c at 9.10 Elsewhere, no-frills 
airline Ryanair was down 7c to 3.30 and bookmaker Paddy Power slipped 70c to 20.60 Other notable movers 
include Elan, down 51c to 16.00, FBD down 40c to 28.30 and ICG up 16c to 23.85. Yesterday morning, AgCert 
management announced that as the company's forward sales commitments exceed its current production capacity 
and that it was not possible to reach agreement with creditors and customers on renegotiation of contracts, the 
Board proposes to file a petition for examinership in Ireland. A court-appointed examiner will now try to formulate a 
scheme of arrangement acceptable to creditors, while maintaining an on-going business. To facilitate negotiations, 
XL TechGroup had bought out one creditor's debt, leaving AgCert with one remaining secured creditor and a range 
ISEQ down on Fitch Irish banks warning
of customers to negotiate with. To date, these negotiations have failed to reach an agreement. The company has 
requested the suspension of trading in its shares pending resolution of its financial position.

marginally, in 2008. "We have already adopted a cautious approach in our CRH forecasts for FY2008 and as such 
we assume a 1pc decline in US non-residential construction activity. Non-residential construction in the US 
accounts for roughly 18pc of group revenue at CRH," Davy Research said. Meanwhile, Grafton was down 10c to 
5.50, McInerney was down 3c at 1.52 and Kingspan slipped 10c to 9.18. Elsewhere, no-frills airline Ryanair was

rival Chiquita after it reported that Q4 operating income increased by 94pc to USD33 million in its banana segment. 
Banana sales rose 2pc. The group attributes this increase in profitability to higher pricing in Europe and North 
America due to constrained volume availability in Q4, compared to the excess supply in Q4 2006, and to its strategy 
of favouring premium product quality and price differentiation over market share. The overall Q4 group operating 
loss of USD11 million was at the favourable end of the range the company provided at the end of January. Chiquita 
expects improved performance in sales and operating income in 2008, primarily due to contract and market price 
increases, and the benefits of restructuring, with a continued strategy to focus on pricing in bananas.

Banks drove the index lower this morning after Credit Suisse and Barclays reported further write-downs. 
At 11.15am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares fell 18.10 points at 6512.57. 
UK banking giant, Barclays, is forecast to post profits close to last year's record level, despite write-downs and bad 
debt provisions
 The credit crunch could see Barclays reveal further losses on top of its £1.3 billion write-down announced last 
November. The bank may also show that it has set aside around £2.65 billion to cover bad debts last year as its 
Barclaycard credit card business continues to see arrears. Also, Credit Suisse Group said today's announced 
USD2.85 billion writedowns were a result of market developments over the last six weeks. Banks dragged the index 
lower. Bank of Ireland was down 13c to 9.37 and AIB fell 13c to 13.27, Anglo Irish Bank slipped 22c to 8.85 and 
Irish Life and Permanent was down 9c at 10.46. In the construction sector, CRH was down 10c to 25.75 and 
Grafton rose 5c to 5.67. McInerney was unchanged at 1.55 and Kingspan was up 2c to 9.10. Elsewhere, no-frills 
airline Ryanair fell 5c to 3.50 and bookmaker Paddy Power surged 32c to 20.74 Other notable movers include Elan, 
down 27c to 17.09, FBD up 20c to 27.20 and Greencore up 18c to 4.23. Shares at Abbey remained unchanged at 
6.00, has now bought back 2.395m shares (8.3pc of the shares in issue) since it began its latest buyback 
programme in December. Its most recent repurchase on February 18th was of 110,000 shares at a price of 600c 
per share. Since December 10th, Abbey has spent E13.87m on buying back its own shares at an average price of 
579c per share. The company can still buy back a further 1.946m shares (6.7pc of the equity before the beginning 
of the buyback). "Share buybacks make better use of Abbey's cash-positive balance sheet, are earnings-enhancing 
and therefore help offset some of the possible downside from the operational result. Our current April 2009 EPS 
forecast is 78.1c but this would rise to 83c if the remainder of the buyback was completed," according to Davy 
Research. Since September 2005, Abbey has repurchased just over 7m of its own shares (21pc of the company) at 
a total cost of E60m.

Shares in Kerry gained 78c after US-based peer in the flavours and fragrances sector, Givaudan, reporting strong 
earnings and sales growth in the emerging markets division, a key part of Kerry growth strategy.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed up 12.89 points at 6453.56. 
Givaudan flavours division grew by 4.2pc in local currency terms in 2007.
 The company implemented a streamlining of its commodity ingredients business; including this effect, sales growth 
was 1.8pc. EBITDA growth in the division increased 11.9pc to CHF491m, with EBITDA margin increasing to 21pc, 
compared to 19.1pc in 2006. All regions recorded strong growth in flavours. There was further momentum in 
Europe and double-digit growth was recorded in Asia The integration of Quest was executed successfully with 
CHF50m of cost savings achieved, which exceeded expectations. Givaudan is confident that it will grow its sales in 
line with the market in 2008. In the banking sector, Bank of Ireland was up 1c to 9.51 and AIB climbed 34c to 13.34, 
Anglo Irish Bank was up 15c to 9.22 and Irish Life and Permanent rose 25c at 10.80. Construction shares were

which INM has a 39.2pc share, reported an 8pc rise in annual net profit on the back of growth in its key markets. 
Management said that it is difficult to forecast against current economic conditions, but confirmed that trading year-

from AUSD159.5 million a year ago and was in line with consensus estimates of AUSD170.6 from ten brokers. 
Underlying revenue increased 4pc to AUSD1.31 billion, while EBITDA was up 6pc to AUSD361 million. Earnings 
Per Share on a diluted basis was up 6pc to 34.4c. .

Body
Irish managed pension funds have plummeted in value by up to E12 billion in a year, new figures from consultants 
Mercer show.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 52.75 points at 6530.67
The on-going stock market crash has seen E5 billion wiped off the value of Irish private sector pensions this year 
alone. 
 Noel Collins of pensions adviser Mercer said most Irish pension funds were down between 3pc and 5pc this year 
However, privately held pension funds are down between 10pc and 12pc from the highs of last year. Irish pension 
funds are heavily invested in Irish-quoted companies, which magnifies the losses when the Irish market goes down. 
The Irish market is down almost 6pc this year, and 34pc off from its high last year. Banks lifted the index higher. 
Bank of Ireland was up 18c to 9.49 and AIB rose 17c to 13.27, Anglo Irish Bank climbed 3c to 9.12 and Irish Life 
and Permanent was up 25c at 10.50 In the construction sector, CRH was up 5c to 25.80 and Grafton fell 2c to 5.60. 
McInerney was down 1c at 1.52 and Kingspan climbed 29c to 9.13. Elsewhere, no-frills airline Ryanair fell 5c to 
3.50 after it begun legal proceedings against financial watchdog, IFSRA, over its alleged failure to probe what the 
airline calls abuse by Aer Lingus of Irish Stock Exchange listing rules. Ryanair also alleges the repeated 
transmission of price sensitive information by Aer Lingus to one large shareholder (the Minister for Transport) in the 
run up to the closure of Aer Lingus's Shannon base, which was announced on August 7 of last year. Shares at 
Siteserv were down 1c at 0.47 despite Speedy Hire, a peer of Siteserv's newly acquired UK business, Deborah 
Services, has issued an upbeat statement to the market (February 18th). The group reports that the positive trading 
seen at the interim results in November has continued with revenue up 43pc on the same quarter in 2006. Overall 
revenue for the nine months to end-December 2007 is currently up 39pc year-on-year. The group's tool hire and 
equipment divisions continue to perform well, generating revenue growth of 47pc and 30pc respectively for the 
nine-month period. Management says that the outlook for tool and equipment hire remains positive and trading

post-Christmas has begun well. While primarily focussed on multi-discipline contracts, Deborah Services provides 
hire and sale of non-mechanical access and building equipment to the UK construction industry. Davy expects the 
acquisition to add c.20pc to their earnings forecasts for the years ending April 2009 and 2010. Meanwhile, shares at 
ICON were down 20c to 45.80 ahead of its Q4 and full year results on February 21. "We anticipate a 32pc advance 
in Q4 revenues (USD170.6 million) and a 31pc increase in EPS (51c). Consensus for the latter is 50.3c. A 
combination of organic revenue growth and margin expansion will drive the results. The clinical division is forecast 
to grow revenues by 35pc and PBIT margins should expand modestly year-on-year. "However, we expect the 
quarter-on-quarter comparison to be flat-to-lower, given the dollar impact on those contracts executed in Europe but 
denominated in dollars," Davy Research said. Finally, shares at United Drug were down 6c to 3.88 after it was 
reported this morning that the Health Services Executive (HSE) in Ireland has written to the three main wholesale 
companies (United Drug, Celesio and Uniphar) warning that it may tender internationally for the supply of drugs if 
the wholesalers do not clarify their position on passing on the wholesale margin cuts to the pharmacists, as required 
by the HSE.

Ryanair has begun legal proceedings against financial watchdog, IFSRA, over its alleged failure to probe what the 
airline calls abuse by Aer Lingus of Irish Stock Exchange listing rules.
Ryanair also alleges the repeated transmission of price sensitive information by Aer Lingus to one large 
shareholder (the Minister for Transport) in the run up to the closure of Aer Lingus's Shannon base which was 
announced on August 7 of last year.
Ryanair said its case rests upon the published report of the Secretary General of the Department of Transport (Ms 
Julie O'Neill) which recorded a series of meetings and briefings between senior Aer Lingus executives and this one 
large shareholder (the Government) during the period from June 13 2007 right up to August 3 2007.
 "This report confirms that a series of officials in both the Department of Transport and the Department of the 
Taoiseach were briefed by Aer Lingus in June and July last on their plans to close the Shannon base and transfer 
these slots to Belfast," Ryanair said.

Suzuki's new Splash model will go on sale in Ireland next autumn, when prices will be announced.
Successor to the Wagon R range, it is part of a Suzuki-led joint project with the upcoming Opel Agila, the cars being 
built in Hungary.
The Splash uses a modified Swift platform and is offered with 1-litre and 1.2-litre petrol engines, plus the ubiquitous 
1.3-litre 75bhp diesel. The upright body has decent room for four adults, though luggage space is limited.
Driven in France, the car was comfortable and surefooted. However, while the diesel version was a good all-
rounder, the 1.2-litre petrol unit was under strain on uphill stretches of motorway. This would confine the 1-
litremodel to a purely urban role, to which it is well suited, with its compact size and easy parking.
Diesel boost for Accord
Honda had an excellent result in Europe last year, with sales up 21.4 per cent over the 2006 figure. During the past 
year, the company sold 398,579 units.
Growth is set to continue with the announcement of a new generation Honda Accord, due this summer. This is a 
major model change, with new platform and suspension systems set to feature.
While the 2-litre and 2.4litre petrol engines are improvements on existing units, great interest will focus on the new 
ultra-clean diesel engine, which develops 148bhp and 350Nm torque.
Honda says this engine meets the strictest US environment rules without need for modification.
Mazda off to a good start Mazda Ireland got off to a strong start in January with a brand record 1,608 passenger car 
sales. This is a 27 per cent increase on the same month last year and gives Mazda a 3.4 per cent share of the 
national market.
Ireland gets set for a Splash
The Mazda 3 led the way with 579 registrations, closely followed by the new-generation Mazda 6 which had 557 
sales. The new Mazda 2 accounted for 246 units. A revised Mazda 5 is now on sale, along with the powerful CX-7 
SUV.
No Nonsense from Ryanair Ryanair has entered the car insurance market in conjunction with FBD. The new service 
is called No Nonsense Car Insurance. Savings between 23 per cent and 48 per cent are claimed, depending on 
cover sought. See www.ryanaircarinsurance.com.
Fiat 500 has a funky appeal The new Fiat 500 went on sale in Ireland during the week. It is aimed firmly at the 
lifestyle segment of the market, in much the same way as the Mini or the iPhone.
Its funky looks are a mix of nostalgia and modernism. The base of the car comes from the Panda platform, but the 
new Fiat 500 is full of up-to-date engineering and technology, underlined by its five-star Euro NCAP rating.
Three engine options are available: a 69bhp 1.2-litre 8v; a 100bhp 1.4-litre 16v; and a 1.3-litre multi-jet diesel in 
75bhp guise. Emission figures are low, with the diesel at only 111g/km, the 1.2-litre petrol at 119g/km and the 1.4-
litre at 149g/km.
There are three trim levels, called Pop, Lounge and Sport. All models have seven airbags. While Pop spec is quite 
basic, paying  2,000 extra for Lounge trim brings a much better level. Prices for the 1.2litre model start at  13,995, 
with both 1.4-litre petrol and the diesel at  15,995. Note that only 1.4-litre models have an ESC system as standard.
Lexus launches rival to M3 Lexus will launch its new compact sports saloon, the IS-F, in Europe in April. The Irish 
price will be around  107,000. The IS-F has a 5-litre V8 engine producing 423bhp and 505Nm torque, enough 
firepower to bring BMW'sM3 directly into its sights.
The engine is linked to a modified version of the eight-speed automatic transmission first unveiled in the LS460 
saloon. Around town, the car is as docile to drive as you could wish.
However, get it out on an empty country road and it becomes a real sports car, with a spine-tingling mechanical 
noise at high revs and performance to match; witness the 4.8 seconds taken to reach 100km/h from rest.
Initial impressions are that this is a real rival to the BMW M3 and, as a four-door saloon, more practical, too.
Additions to sat-nav systems New technology is being incorporated into sat-nav systems on a regular basis. Two 
interesting additions aimed at delivering additional safety were announced during the week.
Toyota has perfected an add-on which uses positioning to warn drivers of an approaching stop sign. It is 
incorporated into the vehicle's Brake Assist system.
The technology, which provides a warning initially 100 metres before a stop sign, then gives a voice warning about 
four seconds before arrival. Should the driver then react suddenly, the brakes will be applied with the additional 
power of the Brake Assist system. Meanwhile, BMW, in association with digital map-maker Navteq, says it will 
incorporate a new warning into the vehicle's sat-nav equipment.
In countries with modern traffic information services - not available in Ireland - drivers will be warned should a 
vehicle be coming towards them on a motorway in the wrong direction.

Shares on the Dublin market were lower this morning after Bank of Ireland said the continuing volatility in markets is 
impacting its financial performance
At 11.00am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 24.53 points at 6511.17
Bank of Ireland was down 9c at 9.34 after it this morning released an Interim Management Statement in which it 
cuts EPS guidance by 4pc for the full year to end March '08. AIB fell 20c at 13.45, Anglo Irish Bank slipped 12c at 
9.38 and Irish Life and Permanent climbed 14c to 10.25. In the construction sector, CRH was up 36c to 25.57 and 
Grafton rose 12c to 5.81. McInerney was up 3c at 1.53 and Kingspan was up 1c at 8.71. Elsewhere, no-frills airline 
Ryanair fell 1c to 3.60 and Irish pharmaceutical company Elan rose 5c to 17.29. Other notable movers include ICG 
down 5c to 23.45, Kerry Group up 54c to 19.29, DCC up 5c to 16.80 and FBD down 30c to 27.50. Shares at UV 
remained flat at 3.60 after UTV's portfolio of Irish radio stations performed quite well in the most recent JNLR 
figures, released this morning (February 15th), covering the period January 2007 to December 2007. In Cork, 
where UTV has its most valuable Irish radio assets, 96 and 103FM maintained dominance with a share of 52pc, 
down from 52.9pc in the preceding reporting period but up from 51.7pc in the equivalent period last year. Its nearest 
rival in Cork, Red FM, increased its share by 0.7pc to 11pc. In the competitive Dublin market, Q102 saw its share 
increase from 6.3pc to 7pc. UTV's recently acquired FM104 station maintained its market-leading position with a 
12pc share, down from 12.5pc. Its main rival, 98FM, saw its share fall from 12pc to 11pc. FM104 maintained its 
leading position in the Dublin market, achieving a market share of 12.5pc. "The performance of FM104 is of 
particular interest given that it is the first period since UTV acquired the station in December," according to Davy

Highlight: Shares at O'Reilly's Waterford Wedgwood could not go any lower .
Body
Shares at Tony O'Reilly's troubled luxury brands group Waterford Wedgwood had another bad day today.
They fell by 11pc or so after the group issued another negative trading statement. 
Its shares have in recent years become among the cheapest on the Dublin market, but this was ridiculous.
 They fell in Dublin trading from 1.9 cent to 1.7 cent. In its statement, the group reduced its revenue and EBITDA 
forecasts for the current year, which ends in March. It is now expecting revenue to be in the region of E700 million 
and EBITDA to be in negative territory. The update follows a review of current trading and profitability impacts, 
which indicated consumer slowdown, as well as production and distribution problems in the run-up to Christmas 
trading. The latter was affected as a result of the delayed receipt of the recent funding, which affected the 
manufacture, sourcing and distribution of product in time for Christmas. "Given the precarious financial position of 
the firm, the need for ongoing restructuring which may result in further fundraisings, additional downgrades 
following this release and the deteriorating economic outlook, we believe the prospects for the firm to be uncertain 
at best. Hence, we reiterate our cautious stance around the company, Philip O'Sullivan, analyst at Goodbody 
Stockbrokers said. Overall, the ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 57.78 points lower on the session at 6, 477.92 
Bank of Ireland was down 13c to 931 after it released its own management statement in which it cuts earnings per 
share guidance by nearly 4pc for the full year to end March 2008. AIB fell 41c to 1310, Anglo Irish Bank slipped 41c 
to 909 and Irish Life & Permanent dropped 14c to 1025. In the construction sector, CRH was up 54c to 2575, while 
Grafton fell 7c to 562. McInerney was up 3c at 153 and Kingspan rose 14c to 884. Elsewhere, no-frills airline 
Ryanair fell 6c to 355 while bookmaker Paddy Power slipped 20c to 2080. Other notable movers include ICG down 
15c to 2335, Kerry Group up 70c to 1945, DCC down 15c to 1660 and FBD down 15c to 2765. Shares at UTV 
remained flat at 360 after the broadcaster's portfolio of Irish radio stations performed quite well in the most recent 
JNLR figures. In Cork, where UTV has its most valuable Irish radio assets, 96FM and 103FM maintained 
dominance with a share of 52pc, down from 52.9pc in the preceding reporting period but up from 51.7pc in the 
Dublin market ends week on a low
equivalent period last year. Its nearest rival in Cork, Red FM, increased its share by 0.7pc to 11pc. In the 
competitive Dublin market, Q102 saw its share increase from 6.3pc to 7pc. UTV's recently acquired FM104 station 
maintained its market-leading position with a 12pc share, down from 12.5pc. Its main rival, 98FM, saw its share fall 
from 12pc to 11pc. FM104 maintained its leading position in the Dublin market, achieving a market share of 12.5pc. 
"The performance of FM104 is of particular interest given that it is the first period since UTV acquired the station in 
December," according to Davy Research, "We estimate that Irish radio accounts for approximately 20pc of group 
earnings." UTV shares dipped by 12c to 348. Also, shares at Irish biotechnology company Elan were down 14c to 
1710 despite its solid set of Q4 results this week that shoed it as a company with one potential blockbuster on the 
market and another proceeding through the regulatory process.

Spain 's Iberia airline to launch bid for rival Spanair
Spain's Iberia airline to launch bid for rival Spanair

Iberia, Spain's flagship airline, plans to bid for Spanair, an ailing unit of Scandinavia's SAS AB, the Spanish carrier 
said in a statement Thursday.
Iberia said in a regulatory filing that it planed to launch the bid in partnership with local Spanish transport company 
Gestair. Market analysts estimated Spanair's worth could be around €800 million ($1US.17 billion).
If successful, a takeover of the country's second-largest carrier would give Iberia a tighter grip on domestic flights, 
currently under siege from local and international low-cost airlines.
Iberia has 35 per cent of Spain's domestic air travel market and runs a fleet of 145 aircraft which fly domestic and 
international routes. Spanair operates 65 aircraft, mostly on short-haul internal flights.
Iberia's leading shareholder, Madrid-based savings bank Caja Madrid, recently raised its holding in Spain's flagship 
to 23 percent, a move that disrupted an approach from code-share partner British Airways and U.S. private equity 
firm TPG which had presented a proposal that valued Iberia at €3.4 billion ($4US.97).
Iberia restructured short-haul and domestic flights after the arrival on the market of low-cost carriers easyJet PLC 
and Ryanair by eliminating unprofitable routes that did not use its new, expanded hub in Madrid, from where it also 
operates most of its profitable long-haul flights.
It also launched Clickair, a Barcelona-based budget carrier that took over many domestic and European flights.
Iberia controls 20 percent of Clickair votes and 80 percent of its capital but has no managerial role in the company. 
In this way it obtained lower labor costs by preventing workers in Clickair from demanding Iberia's superior labor 
conditions.
Iberia said its offer would be subject to unspecified conditions and did not provide additional details.
Iberia officials declined to comment. A spokesman for SAS could not be reached for comment.
Spanair posted an after-tax loss of 250 million Swedish kronor ($39US million; €26.66 million) last year.

Banks were the worst performer on the Dublin this morning after financial giant UBS has declined to rule out the 
possibility of further write offs from the sub prime crisis
At 11.20am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 0.40 points at 6596.43
The bank reported a full year net loss of 4.384 billion sfr, down from a profit of 12.257 billion and in line with its own 
guidance, hit by sharp losses in the investment banking segment following writedowns of more than 18 billion usd 
related to its US subprime market exposure.
 Looking ahead, UBS said it expects 2008 to be another difficult year but declined to comment on whether it 
foresees more subprime writedowns Bank of Ireland was down 12c at 9.44 and AIB fell 33c at 13.67. Anglo Irish 
Bank slipped 22c at 9.38 and Irish Life and Permanent rose 4c to 10.36. In the construction sector, CRH was up 
40c to 25.90 after Vulcan Materials, one of CRH's peers in its Americas Materials business, reported Q4 and full 
year results slightly ahead of expectations. Management reiterated full year 2008 earnings guidance, indicating that 
aggregates prices should increase by a further 8-10pc. This is positive for CRH - we are assuming aggregates price 
increases in its Americas Materials business (the largest division in the group) of 5pc in 2008, according to Davy 
Research. Grafton rose 3c to 5.72, McInerney was down 4c at 1.50 and Kingspan dropped 8c to 8.52. Elsewhere, 
bookmaker Paddy Power was down 27c to 21.20 and no-frills airline Ryanair fell 4c to 3.56. Other notable movers 
include ICG down 53c to 23.62, Kerry Group up 13c to 18.43, DCC up 21c to 16.66 and FBD down 20c to 27.80. 
Meanwhile, shares at Veris were unchanged at 1.75 after it scooped two new facilities management contracts in 
recent weeks. The first is an 18-month contract with the Office of Public Works in Ireland to help it achieve its goal 
of a 15pc reduction in its carbon footprint. Veris will effectively provide a consultancy service to monitor energy use 
patterns across the OPW and provide education and training for staff with the aim of materially lowering carbon 
emissions. The second contract is a five-year contract with Forfas. Forfas is Ireland's national policy and advisory

division within Veris remains the engine of growth in the business at present. The company is continuing to bed in 
the acquisition of Orange in the UK and is continuing its operational review of the property management (pm) 
division," according to Flor O' Donoghue, analyst at Davy Research. Also, shares at drinks group C and C were flat 
at 4.38 on news that Daigeo is on track to attain its full-year guidance, after its H1 profit increased by 9pc. Within 
this, global volumes were up 4pc including 3pc for Guinness and 5pc for Baileys. In relation to Guinness, a 20pc 
increase in marketing was a key factor behind the improved performance. In Great Britain its sales increased by 
8pc and increased its share by 0.5pc, while in Ireland sales were up 3pc with a 1.3pc improvement in market share, 
helped by a slowdown in the switch from the on to the off-trade by consumers. "All else being equal, an improved 
result for Diageo in Ireland, would suggest lower market share gain for C and C in the Irish market," Goodbody 
Research said.

Ryanair to close tickets website for 3 days after OFT warning - report

Ryanair, the budget airline, is closing its website for three days next week after missing a deadline set by the Office 
of Fair Trading (OFT) to remove misleading prices from the site, the Times reported.
The expensive shutdown will allow Ryanair to revamp its website and meet the OFT's rules for including taxes and 
other charges within headline fares, the paper said.
It could cost the carrier 20 mln stg in lost revenue, delivering a further blow to the airline after it said profits could 
halve next year because of worsening economic conditions, the newspaper reported, adding that concern over the 
airline's strategy has prompted Deutsche Bank to warn of a possible 'business model failure'.
The OFT gave Ryanair a deadline of Jan 31 to make changes to its fares. When this was missed, the Ireland-based 
carrier was given a new deadline of the end of February. The airline is understood to have told the OFT that next 
week's three-day website shutdown was to enable it to comply with the new rules, the Times said.
The paper said that if it had missed yet another deadline, the OFT could have begun enforcement proceedings 
against Ryanair. This could have resulted in a court order to shut down the airline's booking system until the fare 
changes were made, it added.
The OFT was concerned that airlines were misleading passengers by advertising low fares that did not include 
extras, such as tax. However, Ryanair said yesterday that it was closing online bookings only to expand the 
website's capacity, the Times reported.

Eurozone economic growth is in trouble, adding pressure on the European Central Bank to cut rates soon and 
forcing Irish firms to revise their plans to cope with a tougher environment ahead.
Evidence from the latest key economic indicator, a measure of industrial output, points to signs that growth in the 
single 13-member economy is slowing.
Industrial production fell 0.2pc in December compared to the previous month, the second monthly fall in a row, for a 
gain of 1.3pc compared to the same month in the previous year, the European Union statistics office said.
 Economists are now saying that this will mean greater pressure on the ECB to cut rates sooner rather than later 
despite high inflation. Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline has already devised a strategy to cope with a worst-case 
scenario - a recession in Europe that mirrors the current slump in the US economy. The no-frills airline has factored 
a European recession lasting up to 18 months into its business plan, its Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said. 'We 
think the likelihood of a recession in Europe this year is strong,' Mr O'Leary said. Surprisingly, Mr O'Leary added 
that he would welcome a recession, saying that it would make consumers 'more cost conscious and therefore 
choose Ryanair'. Economic growth in the eurozone is expected to slow to below 2pc this year from around 2.6pc 
estimated for 2007 as a result of the global credit crunch, slower growth in the United States, high oil prices and a 
strong euro. But with eurozone inflation at a record high of 3.2pc year-on-year in January, the ECB has signalled it 
was not ready to cut rates yet, moving only to a neutral policy stance from a tightening bias.

Smurfit Kappa led the Dublin market lower today after forecasting modest growth for this year.
At 11.30am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 52.35 points at 6595.42
Garry McGann, group chief executive hailed what he called a 'strong' set of results despite the 'uncertain economic 
outlook, our operations have performed well year to date in an operating environment where supply and demand 
are reasonably balanced.
 Shares at the company fell 31c to 8.91 This week so far markets have been dominated by the continued ebb and 
flow of sentiment in relation to the global banking system, according to Davy Research. The week got off to a poor 
start on Monday February 11th after the G7 meeting at the weekend where ministers speculated that the total sub-
prime related write-offs might be as high as USD400 billion. Yesterday there was a sharp bounce back in banking 
shares when it was revealed that Warren Buffet was willing to take on at least some of the problematic liabilities of 
the mono line insurers. Today, however, markets are likely to refocus on real economic numbers again and the 
January retail sales figure in particular. "The revelation last month that both the headline and core readings fell 
0.4pc in December damaged markets quite significantly. Perhaps the most important element of the debate on 
whether the US is or is not heading for recession is whether or not US consumer spending is headed for its first 
quarterly decline since the early 1990s. Today's number is expected to show another fall of 0.3pc in the headline 
index but a rise of 0.2pc in the core index excluding autos," it said. Bank of Ireland was down 19c at 9.61 and AIB

Ryanair led the Dublin market lower today after its boss said the airline has factored a European recession lasting 
up to 18 months into its business plan.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 51.74 points at 6596.03
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary added that he would welcome an economic slowdown across the continent 
that would make consumers more cost conscious and therefore choose Ryanair. 
 He was speaking in Spain, where Ryanair said it would invest USD140 million in two planes to serve 12 routes 
from a new base at Reus airport near Barcelona in Spain. The airline is making the airport its 26th European hub. 
Shares at the no-frills airline were down 10c at 3.64. Meanwhile, Bank of Ireland was down 17c at 9.63 and AIB fell 
18c at 14.12. Anglo Irish Bank slipped 24c at 9.60 and Irish Life and Permanent fell 48c to 10.20. The value of new 
mortgage lending slumped by 20pc in the last quarter and is down 15pc in the full-year 2007 as the property slump 
accelerates, the latest figures from the Irish Banking Federation shows. The latest IBF/PwC Mortgage Market 
Profile shows that 37,719 new mortgages to the value of some E8.3 billion were issued during the fourth quarter of 
2007, bringing to 158,098 the total number of new mortgages issued in 2007 to a value of E33.8 billion. The number 
of mortgages issued was down 22pc in the fourth quarter compared to the same three-month period in 2006 and is 
also down 22pc in the full year compared to 2006. First-time buyers (FTB) have increased their share (by volume) 
of the total mortgage market to 19.3pc in 2007, which is up from 18pc in 2006. The value of mover mortgages was 
down 30pc in the fourth quarter as home owners wait out the property slump. In the quarter, top-ups were down 
27pc, first-time buyers dropped 23pc and buy-to-let mortgages declined by 24pc while re-mortgages or switchers 
were up 13pc as banks, such as Ulster Bank with its E2,000 incentive announced this week, compete to poach 
each other's customers. Commenting on the data, IBF Chief Executive, Pat Farrell, said: "Our data is wholly 
consistent with all other indicators of housing market activity in showing that the mortgage market continues to 
adjust to more sustainable levels of new lending. That said, within a market that continues to grow in absolute terms

and now stands at E140 billion, the first-time buyer share is staying consistently strong, the residential investment

Irish shares rallied by 2 percent today, boosted by the news that US billionaire investor Warren Buffett has offered 
to help out troubled bond insurers.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed up 158.49 points at 6647.77
Buffett said his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. holding company has offered a second level of insurance on up to USD800 
billion in municipal bonds. The reinsurance offer is for bond insurers Ambac Financial Group Inc., MBIA Inc. and 
Financial Guaranty Insurance Co., known as FGIC. 
Word of the offer gives some investors relief although Buffett says a deal would only back municipal bonds, and not 
the risky and complicated financial instruments that many see as more likely to have problems. Still, offering 
investors further assurances on the soundness of municipal bonds could help shore up Wall Street's confidence 
and reinforce the differences in quality among various levels of debt. Financials made significant gains on the news. 
Bank of Ireland was up 18c at 9.66 and AIB rose 6c at 14.05. Anglo Irish Bank climbed 23c at 9.68 and Irish Life 
and Permanent rose 39c to 10.49. In the construction sector, CRH was up 53c to 24.50 and Grafton rose 18c to

CVC owns Univeg, a leading Belgian operator in the produce sector which produces and imports fruit and

local and regional newspapers in Ireland to 15 titles. Given the modest scale of the Sligo Champion (c.E3.8m 
revenue and c.E2 million profits), this deal will have a minor effect on our forecasts for the company, according to 
Philip O'Sullivan, analyst at Goodbody Research. Finally, shares at FBD were unchanged at 28.00 on news that it is 
to underwrite car insurance through a new company called "No nonsense" car insurance, which will use the 
Ryanairmoney.com website for customer acquisition. The move will enable FBD to target a customer profile that it 
would not normally pick up through its core brand/distribution channels, i.e. those interested in the lowest cost 
policy with no frills attached. As volumes ramp up, the business should also provide a home for some of the excess 
capital being spun out of the group. Davy estimates this will be back to over E80 million by the end of this year. 
Customers on the website will be able to build their policy online from start to finish and add differing levels of 
protection and features with an instant price update.

Banks dragged the Dublin market into negative territory today. 
At 11.30am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 8.37 points at 6480.91
Bank of Ireland was down 7c at 9.41 and AIB fell 13c at 13.86. Anglo Irish Bank was down 4c at 9.41.
 CRH was up 8c to 24.05 and Grafton fell 4c to 5.40. McInerney was up 4c at 1.54 and Kingspan dropped 2c to

notable movers include ICG down 60c to 24.00, Kerry Group down 8c to 18.08 and DCC down 59c to 16.04 Shares 
at Total Produce rose 1c to 0.55 after the EU Commission has cleared private equity group CVC Capital's proposed 
takeover of France's Katope International, a producer and importer of fruit and vegetables. No details of the 
transaction are available. CVC owns Univeg, a leading Belgian operator in the produce sector which produces and 
imports fruit and vegetables as well as plants, flowers and convenience meals. Also, shares at Independent News 
and Media were down 4c to 2.00 despite concluding due diligence and signing contracts as part of its agreed E20m 
deal to acquire the Sligo Champion, a regional newspaper in the north-west of Ireland. The acquisition remains 
subject to the approval of the Competition Authority and if consent is granted from the regulator it will take INM's 
portfolio of local and regional newspapers in Ireland to 15 titles. Given the modest scale of the Sligo Champion

to Philip O'Sullivan, analyst at Goodbody Research. Finally, shares at Icon rose 50c to 42.50 after it announced the 
acquisition of Healthcare Discoveries Inc from Catalyst Pharma Group Inc Icon paid an initial consideration of 
USd12m (c.E8.2m), with up to a maximum of a further USD10m (c.E6.8m) payable, should the company achieve 
certain targets in 2008. No further financial details were given.

Brussels Airport 17 mln eur new low-cost terminal operational from 2009 - report
Brussels Airport 17 mln eur new low-cost terminal operational from 2009 - 
report

Brussels Airport's new 17 mln eur low-cost terminal will be operational from next year, and expects to attract an 
additional 4 mln passengers to the airport annually, Belgian weekend press reported.
The new terminal will renovate a disused section of the airport, adding a new jetty with six gates, financial daily 
L'Echo reported, citing a decision taken by Brussels Airport management.
Currently only 22 low-cost flights operate daily from the airport, making up 3 pct of the total traffic. This is less than 
Paris Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam Schiphol, Munich and Vienna.
'That is too few compared to what our competitors are offering,' the airport's chief executive Wilfied van Assche told 
La Libre Belgique.
EasyJet PLC welcomed the move as a 'step in the right direction', whereas the Belgian airlines organisation BATA 
is already talking of 'discrimination', since the new terminal will be limited to low-cost carriers, likely excluding flag-
carrier Brussels Airlines.
For the time being, Brussels Airlines remains guarded on the plans. It said: 'We will study and evaluate the project 
with care.'
However, L'Echo said: 'No one is fooled. The low-cost terminal is conceived on the EasyJet model and the 
B.flex/B.light (Brussels Airlines' tariff scheme) model does not fit into this scheme.'
The airline also disputed its exclusion from the title of low-cost carrier, since it offers a number of its B.light fares 
from 49 eur single, including taxes.
A company spokesman told La Libre Belgique: 'They are forgetting a bit quickly that our company has launched a 
range of tariffs as competitive as the recognised low-cost companies.'
Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC said it does not fear competition to its services from Brussels South 
Charleroi Airport, with which it signed a ten-year commitment in December 2006.
'We have the most competitive operational costs here and guaranteed growth possibilities,' a Ryanair spokesman 
told L'Echo.
Brussels Airport 17 mln eur new low-cost terminal operational from 2009 - report
Charleroi Airport chief executive Marcel Buelens warned that Brussels Airport's new project would sound the death 
knell for Brussels Airlines.
'It is evident that this new low-cost terminal is being made to measure for EasyJet which will kill off Brussels Airlines 
with its (more competitive) fares structure,' he told L'Echo.

Greencore was the surprise mover on the Dublin market today amid speculation that Icelandic investors are 
building a stake in the food company. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed down 48.63 points at 6489.28
Shares at the food group climbed 19c to 4.19 on reports that brothers, Lydur and Agust Gudmundsson, who sit on 
Iceland's Exista board, had purchased over 8pc in Greencore using contracts for difference (CFDs). 
 Exista decline to make any comment on the report. Meanwhile, Bank of Ireland was down 12c at 9.47 and AIB fell 
49c at 14.09. Anglo Irish Bank was down 25c at 9.39. Irish Life and Permanent slipped 33c to 9.97 on news that 
global investment bank Merrill Lynch is set to pull out of its E300 million sub-prime joint venture, Springboard 
Mortgages, with Irish Life and Permanent (IL and P). Sub-prime loans offer mortgages to people with poor credit 
histories and self-employed individuals who have difficulty proving their incomes. The loans sector collapsed in the 
US last year, sending shock-waves throughout the global financial market. IL and P and Merrill Lynch currently own 
equal shares of the Springboard Mortgages joint venture. If Merrill Lynch pull out, it is likely that IL and P will buy 
the investment bank's share itself and retain Springboard as a separate business entity. Springboard sold between 
E150 million and E200 million of subprime mortgages in Ireland in the past year. Construction shares were hit 
sector on news that activity in the Irish construction fell to its lowest level since records began, according to the 
latest Ulster Bank Construction Purchasing Managers' Index. The index posted 35.3 in January where a reading 
above 50 denotes growth and below 50 shows recession. It has signalled falling construction activity in each month 
since last June. Chief economist with Ulster Bank, Pat McArdle, said: "It is clear the decline in construction activity 
accelerated in recent months and the January number is a low for the series which began in June 2000. "A small 
bounce in new orders is unlikely to be sufficient to prevent further falls in activity. Employment falls were a survey 
record for the second consecutive month in January." Housing remained the worst performer last month. CRH was 
down 1c to 23.65 and Grafton fell 4c to 5.40. McInerney was down 1c at 1.50 and Kingspan dropped 13c to 8.47. 
Dublin market closes lower on banks
Elsewhere, bookmaker Paddy Power was up 19c to 20.49 and no-frills airline Ryanair rose 8c to 3.60. Other 
notable movers include ICG up 35c to 24.00, Kerry Group down 8c to 18.07 and DCC don 15c to 16.54. Shares at 
Aminex were down 9c at 0.26 after it announced that it is to plug its Kiliwani-1 well offshore Tanzania. "While clearly 
a disappointing result, the impact on our valuation is not material as we had valued this well at 0.7p per share. The 
Kiliwani-1 well will now be plugged and abandoned," Davy Research said. Also, shares at drinks group C and C 
rose 12c to 4.33 despite off-trade data, as recorded by Nielsen, showed that January was weak for C and C, even 
allowing for the normal seasonal movements. January is the weakest month of the year and December one of the 
strongest, and last December was a bumper one for Magners.

Shares on the Dublin market began the week on a low note. 
At 11.40am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 58.83 points at 6479.08
Bank of Ireland was down 10c at 9.49 and AIB fell 25c at 14.33. Anglo Irish Bank was down 12c at 9.52 and Irish 
Life and Permanent slipped 20c to 10.10. 
 An article in the Sunday Independent yesterday indicated that Merrill Lynch plans to exit its non-conforming 
mortgage joint venture with IL and P, Springboard Mortgages, on the back of the US sub-prime mortgage crisis. 
Neither company commented on the news when contacted by the newspaper. The article speculates that IL and P 
would buy out Merrill's 50pc share of Springboard should it pull out and operate it as a separate business entity. 
Gross new lending by the business was estimated at between E150-200m last year, which equates to an estimated 
2.5pc of 2007f gross new mortgage lending or 1.4pc of Group gross new lending for IL and P. In the construction 
sector, McInerney was up 3c at 1.54 and Kingspan was unchanged at 8.60. CRH was down 11c to 23.55 and 
Grafton climbed 1c to 5.45. Elsewhere, bookmaker Paddy Power was up 19c to 20.49 and no-frills airline Ryanair 
rose 5c to 3.57. Other notable movers include ICG up 20c to 23.75, Kerry Group down 5c to 18.10 and Greencore 
up 25c to 4.25. Shares at Aminex were unchanged at 0.35 after it announced this morning that the Kiliwani-1 well 
offshore Tanzania has been completed. The well did encounter a number of sands, but logging and sampling of the 
primary Neocomian reservoir target did not yield commercial quantities of hydrocarbons (these sands were found 
below the gas-water contact of the adjacent Songo-Songo gas field). "While clearly a disappointing result, the 
impact on our valuation is not material as we had valued this well at 0.7p per share. The Kiliwani-1 well will now be 
plugged and abandoned," Davy Research said. A second well on the Nyuni block offshore Tanzania immediately 
follows. This well, Kiliwani North-1, will target the adjacent Songo-Songo reservoir system and a shallower Tertiary 
structure. Significantly, this exploration well will test a potential oil play on the block. Aminex has a 39pc working 
interest in the Nyuni block. Also, shares at drinks group C and C rose 4c to 4.25 despite off-trade data, as recorded

Ryanair, which takes 99pc of its bookings over the Internet, will close its site for three days later this month for what 
it called 'essential system changeover/upgrade'.
The shutdown will allow the website to meet regulations set by the UK's Office of Fair Trading, which said the airline 
had not met its deadline of the end of January to be more transparent over its advertised fares.
Ryanair said there were 'several elements' to the website change, one of which was the regulatory requirement. 
Phone bookings will also be unavailable.
 The website will be unavailable for 73 hours from 10pm on February 22 to 11pm on February 25. Flights will be

Weak sterling adds to downward spiral
Weak sterling adds to downward spiral

More blue-chip Irish firms face earnings downgrades as the global stock market downturn begins to bite. Richard 
Curran and Samantha McCaughren report.
There was strong evidence last week that the so-called perfect storm brewing in global stock markets has begun to 
hit actual corporate earnings in Ireland.
Up to now, the main negative factors weighing on the global economy, namely the credit crunch, high oil prices, a 
construction slowdown and fal ling house pr ices, had dented confidence and pulled down share prices.
But, last week, the impact of a weak sterling reared its head with an actual profit warning from DCC. Readymix and 
Ryanair made the picture even bleaker by issuing stark warnings of their own.
With the exception of housebuilders, we had seen little by way of a direct impact any of this bad news flow was 
having on corporate earnings.
However, the bad news of last week is likely to be repeated in the months ahead as more companies are expected 
to have earnings forecasts downgraded and deliver actual profit warnings.
On Tuesday, DCC issued its first interim management statement. Despite an upbeat assessment of performance in 
the third quarter with an acceleration of profit growth, the company's comments about sterling sent its shares 
downward.
The weakness of sterling against the euro will have a translation impact on the group's profits in the fourth quarter 
of this year, and into its 2009 financial year. While brokers put the dent in profit growth at just  3 million for this year 
and  12 million for next year, it was enough to send DCC shares heading south in a hurry.
Weak sterling adds to downward spiral
The news was significant because it was the first time that a major Irish company had identified a direct financial hit 
from the fall in the value of sterling. Around 63 per cent of DCC's earnings are in sterling, and the company's shares 
fell by 7 per cent.
Inevitably, the news puts a spotlight on other companies with relatively high sterling and, to a lesser extent, high 
dollar exposures.
Analysts, as well as company forecasts, have been aware of the potential impact of a weaker dollar for some time, 
and have factored this into their numbers. The same cannot be said of the sterling shift. And with around 30 per 
cent of the earnings of Iseq-listed companies derived from Britain, the unexpected weakness of sterling will hit 
several companies this year, should it continue.
Ross McEvoy, equity analyst with Bloxham's, said: ''Sterling will have the biggest impact because we didn't see it 
coming. It was such a sharp move, and people wouldn't have priced it in to any of their models." Indeed, few 
companies would have foreseen sterling's current level of 74.4p against the euro.
''Most of the [stockbroking] houses would have put a call on sterling," said McEvoy. ''For example, in our models, 
we have used a sterling valuation of 69p to the euro. So every time that moves, obviously there is a cut to 
earnings."
Since December 20, sterling has weakened 4 per cent against the euro, and 10 per cent depreciation since 
September. ''It's a big translation effect in the currency and another headwind that Irish companies don't need at the 
moment," McEvoy said.
Flor O'Donoghue of Davy Stockbrokers commented: ''Should the euro-sterling rate average 74-75p in 2008, and 
with UK earnings translated at the average rate for the year, it will amount to another hurdle."
Last week's warning from DCC was the first to flag the impact of sterling on its performance but several more may 
follow. Greencore, Kingspan, Abbey, McInerney and Grafton are among the most likely to have to downgrade on 
earnings, should the situation continue.
Around 75 per cent of Greencore's profits come from Britain, while 58 per cent of Kingspan's earnings are exposed 
to sterling. Grafton's exposure is 51 per cent and McInerney's is 46 per cent.
The banks will also be impacted, although they may be better placed to offset the currency shift through. But Bank 
of Ireland has the highest level of exposure, and may have to trim its earnings forecasts. Building materials group 
Readymix had to deliver profit a warning last week which seemed a little scary by its brevity.
The company just said that its operating profit would be substantially below expectations. This added to the 
previous negative newsflow from this sector on the back of the slowdown in construction. However, again it showed 
that general concern about company earnings is now turning into actual falls.
The big question for investors is how much of this kind of bad news is already factored into share prices on the Irish 
market.
For example, much has been made in recent weeks of Anglo Irish Bank's exposure to the British commercial 
property market, and the fact that that sector is now going through its worst period for many years.
Yet Goodbody Stockbrokers said last week that it had a 22 per cent value decline built into the average loan size for 
Anglo in its British business in 2008 and 2009. So there may well be a lot of bad news already factored into the 
levels at which quality Irish shares are trading.
The fact that Irish shares took such a pounding in 2007 had prompted speculation that stocks here may have 
bottomed out. This assertion, unfortunately, is not borne out by the performance of international stock markets last 
week. By the end of the week, the Iseq index of Irish shares was at around the 6,477 mark, down 6.5 per cent since 
the start of the year.
Weak sterling adds to downward spiral
While this does compare favourably with other European indices, it doesn't mean that the worst is over. The FTSE 
100 is down 11 per cent. In Paris, the Cac index is down 16 per cent, and in Germany, the Daxis down 16.3 per 
cent.
Looking at the bigger economic picture, it doesn't provide much comfort to investors who want to hear that the tide 
may be ready to turn.

Ryanair's low cost base and impressive financial strength would give it the flexibility to pick up extra business in the 
event of leaner economic times, writes David Clerkin.
Ryanair shareholders developed a sudden but short-lived case of jitters in the hours that followed the no-frills 
airline's third quarter results announcement last week.
Shares fell 13 per cent as investors took fright at chief executive Michael O'Leary's downbeat comments on the 
prospects of a recession, flat passenger yields and oil prices remaining uncomfortably high.
But the airline's spell in the doldrums didn't last long, as the share price recovered its losses even before many 
spooked shareholders had the chance to press the sell button.
Perhaps it was down to investors remembering that O'Leary is fond of delivering highly conservative predictions 
and playing down Ryanair's ability to do well when the going gets tough.
Or maybe they did their sums and realised that Ryanair's bulletproof balance sheet, with over  2 billion in cash, and 
its seemingly unassailable cost advantage left it well placed to come through a recession in better shape than any 
of its rivals.
Even if these subtleties were lost on them, it may have been O'Leary's decision to wave a big sign in their faces that 
finally reassured them, as he announced an unexpected  200 million share buyback programme to be launched 
within days, despite previous signals that there would be no further buybacks until 2009 at the earliest.
O'Leary had sounded gloomy tones when reporting pre-tax profits of  50 million for the quarter ended December, 
bringing total profits for the first nine months of the year to  510 million, up from  423 million at the same point last 
year.
O'Leary downbeat but not out
Despite confirming that the airline was on course to meet its targets for the year to March, it was O'Leary's outlook 
on the remainder of 2008 that caused investor grief. He warned that profits could fall by as much as 50 per cent 
next year if the ''perfect storm'' of oil prices remaining at their current high levels and passenger yields remaining flat 
came to pass.
But this apocalyptic scenario was just one of a number of possible outcomes, as he went on to say that, given the 
right conditions, profits could still rise by 6 per cent on the current year.
A number of analysts expressed surprise at such wide guidance but O'Leary was keen to make sure that any future 
surprises would be positive rather than negative.
''We can only give you our best guidance at any given point in time and we have always been concerned in Ryanair 
to give our shareholders conservative guidance. And I think that's a sensible thing to do and that's what we're giving 
you today," O'Leary told analysts.
''I would not wish to be optimistic at this point in time. I think we are better off to be conservative and pessimistic. 
And I hope that our conservatism and pessimism is overdone."
His actions suggested that he did not fully believe in the worst case scenario. Despite expressing unease about a 
potential recession in Britain and Europe sparked by recent events in the US, O'Leary then produced his cheque 
book.
By choosing to splash out  200 million on buying back Ryanair shares, O'Leary was committing to a spend roughly 
half the size of his momentous investment in Aer Lingus.
For shareholders, however, the sight of O'Leary splashing out cash that he is under no pressure to spend was a 
positive sign: if European economies were about to fall off a cliff and trigger pandemonium in the airline industry, 
surely a prudent airline would seek to hoard as much cash as it could to help ease its way through the downturn.
It is unlikely that O'Leary would fritter away a substantial portion of his cash pile if he was seriously concerned that 
a crisis was around the corner. The Ryanair boss revealed further insights into his thinking by telling analysts that a 
recession in Europe would not necessarily be a bad thing for Ryanair.
A recession ''would be good both for Ryanair's growth, and it would also be good for our cost base, because I think 
it will throw up more opportunities to reduce costs on entry to new airports and new bases at significantly lower 
costs," he said.
In other words, Ryanair's cost bas e and financial strength would give it the flexibility to pick up extra business on 
the back of higher-cost airlines ceasing operations on certain routes, in response to leaner times.
He cited the example of his new base at Birmingham, which he said had been off limits to Ryanair as recently as 
Christmas thanks to an unattractive cost structure on offer from the local airport authority.
But things changed quickly with the decisions of British Airways and low cost carrier Flybe to reduce their services 
from the city, forcing the airport operator to seek replacement business on more attractive terms for Ryanair.
''When we get an opportunity like Birmingham coming to us, because their entire market strategy has been 
transformed by British Airways and Flybe cutting back capacity, you'd be stupid not to expand into that airport," he 
said.
Whether Aer Lingus boss Dermot Mannion, who flirted with launching his first external base in Birmingham before 
opting instead for Belfast, would agree remains to be seen, however.
O'Leary, meanwhile, remained confident that a recession would shake out less efficient operators and create long-
term opportunities for his airline, even if there would be short-term pain on his bottom line.
O'Leary downbeat but not out
''Do I think we'll out perform the market if there is a recession? Yes, I do. We have in each of the last three big 
downturns, which were Gulf War One, 9/11 and Iraq."
O'Leary's logic is simple but attractive: if a recession resulted in the public deciding to stop travelling by air 
tomorrow morning, Ryanair's low costs and cash reserves mean it would be the last in the industry to switch off the 
lights and put up the shutters - long after all its rivals had been forced out of business.
He may warrant criticism for attempting to be too clever in refusing to hedge Ryanair's fuel costs, potentially costing 
the airline millions in unnecessary fuel costs, but this is a mistake that he, perhaps alone among airline bosses, can 
afford to make.

Paul Doran's letter (3/2/08) follows the same old tired argument that has blighted media coverage in Ireland for as 
long as I care to remember.
The usual whinge is that Ireland is akin to a banana republic, and we should follow the lead taken by the morally-
upright and superior British politicians.
It is high time that Ireland as a whole - her media and political opposition especially - emerged from a sulking 
adolescence and faced the modern world confidently, without the need to grab onto apron strings.
It is often extraneous to compare ourselves to a monarchy of 61 million residents, a former colonial power, a 
country that is the most urbanised in the world - and a self-proclaimed Eurosceptic to boot.
Members of Dail Eireann have little to learn from our neighbours in Britain when it comes to standards in politics.
I have yet to see anyone in a position of political power in Britain resign over the numerous cases of collusion with 
paramilitaries in the North, Bloody Sunday or the shooting dead of an innocent Brazilian at a London Underground 
station by police.
I, for one, am quite happy to reside in this great country. If people think Ireland to be a decrepit, scandal-ridden 
banana republic, I would suggest that they make use of the great Irish institution that is Ryanair and book a one-
way ticket to the destination of their choice.

Michael O'Leary's airline has made its fortune on the premise that all's fair in love and advertising, but is it going too 
far these days, asks Catherine O'Mahony.
Ryanair is utterly unrepentant about its many sins against conventional marketing wisdom. But has the airline 
overstepped the mark?
Last week saw Ryanair forced into the unusual position of admitting it was in the wrong. A single Ryanair ad from 
Le Parisien that showed an unauthorised image of French president Nicolas Sarkozy and his soon-to-be bride Carla 
Bruni generated such global controversy and protest that the airline ended up paying Sarkozy a token  1 in 
damages,  60,000 to Bruni and another  60,000 as a charitable contribution.
This was a rare gesture from Ryanair, which has, from its earliest beginnings, pursued an aggressive, rapid-
reaction marketing strategy that has pushed the borders of what is acceptable.
Sarkozy may be the latest target, but Gordon Brown, Bertie Ahern, Mary O'Rourke and even the Pope have all 
been lampooned in Ryanair's traditional full-page press ads, which are fired out hours after whichever incident 
moves Ryanair to take to the media.
The difference this time, it seems, was the sheer scale of the global reaction. ''We have tried to make clear that we 
didn't intend to cause offence," said Ryanair's head of communications, Peter Sherrard. ''It was precisely because 
so much publicity was generated that we decided to add  60,000 as a payment for charity."
More typical of the airline is its blank refusal in recent weeks to accept a ruling from the Advertising Standards 
Authority in Britain to stop using a newspaper ad for ''back to school'' fares that shows a sexy looking young model 
posing, Britney Spears-style, in a short school uniform. The ASA received 13 complaints about the ad - from people 
who felt it sexualised schoolgirls - and has told media owners not to use it.
Ryanair lets fly again
Ryanair accused the ASA of censorship and refused to comply. Sherrard was quoted in the British press as calling 
the ASA ''a bunch of unelected, self-appointed dimwits''.
Stuart Fogarty, director of AFA O'Meara Advertising, said Ryanair had gone too far this time. ''There comes a point 
where you cross the line, and Ryanair has done that . . . There are two areas where you tread very carefully - sex is 
one and religion is the other. You run a risk of creating offence to the people who are your customers."
Fogarty said that, if Ryanair continued to ignore rulings from regulators, media owners would gradually begin to 
refuse to run its advertising.
Media owners, he pointed out, had signed up to advertising codes as well as advertisers, and would not want to fall 
foul of theASA.
Tom Doherty, managing director of advertising agency Publicis QMP, described Ryanair's ad strategy as ''a bit stale 
and tired''.
''They really should be brand building, although it may be too late even to start. The advertising they're doing now is 
the same as they were doing ten years ago. They're behaving like a challenger brand when in fact they're the 
biggest airline in Europe. There comes a point when you need to start to build a brand that's a bit more likeable."
The advertising industry has good reason to be jaded with Ryanair.
Ryanair does not use, and hasn't for many years, any external marketing or advertising support. It's a cheap airline 
in every way: it doesn't spend anything on producing ads, which is why threats from people like the ASA can't really 
hurt it - it has no expensive ad campaigns that might have to be binned if they cause offence.
As the recent tussle in the media makes clear, the airline still manages to generate massive publicity, time after 
time.
In Ireland, the Sarkozy ad story was on the RTE nine o'clock news on at least two occasions, and has been fodder 
for all the big radio chat shows.
The ad was created virtually cost-free on foot of an idea from an unnamed Ryanair employee who, according to 
Sherrard, hadn't been with the company that long. This is the way most Ryanair ads are made. ''Everyone's 
encouraged to suggest them," Sherrard said.
Doherty conceded that  120,000 - the effective cost of this exercise -would have gone nowhere if used to buy the 
kind of media coverage the Sarkozy controversy ended up generating.
''They have done a magnificent job in many ways," he said. ''But it's hard to hang on to a price proposition forever. If 
you look at a brand like say, Dunnes Stores, you can see how the brand starts to evolve over time."
Doherty also made the point that Ryanair's ads were too closely identified with the personality of Michael O'Leary, 
the airline's irreverent boss. Gerry Ryan, while discussing the ads on RTE last week, had called them ''Mick's ads'', 
he noted. He pointed out that this attitude did nothing for the Ryanair brand.
However Ken Robertson, marketing director of betting company Paddy Power, said he was a huge fan of Ryanair's 
ads. ''They're fantastic, they're not afraid to challenge convention, they're a great ballsy brand," he said.
Paddy Power has much in common with Ryanair - they're both Irish companies, unconventional and like to inject 
humour into what they do in advertising.
But Paddy Power does invest heavily in advertising production and media and it has complied with regulators when 
it has been censured. It follows the conventional path of employing an external advertising agency and plans 
nationwide, costly campaigns.
Ryanair lets fly again
''Ryanair's ads are clearly designed primarily to court controversy and that is not what we do," said Robertson.
''But just the response that they elicit shows that they're anything but boring. It's all about the business model - 
they're selling cheap tickets and their ads look and feel quite cheap. And you can't argue with their effectiveness."
Ryanair's Peter Sherrard said he saw no reason to change tack. ''We always aim to entertain with our advertising, 
and our advertising does entertain the vast majority of people. As long as we are entertaining people and selling 
lots of flights, we're happy."
Steering clear of the advertising industry saved Ryanair lots of money and time, he said. ''Ad agencies would take 
months to turn anything around. We can do it straight away. OK, it's fairly rough and ready, but it works."
He said Ryanair had no problem with regulators in most jurisdictions, but said it was not impressed by the 
Advertising Standards Authority, with which it has clashed repeatedly. ''We've had a series of completely 
incomprehensible rulings from the ASA. In this case, it was tantamount to censorship.
''They said they would not have a problem if the ad had appeared in certain tabloids, but they did take issue with the 
way it appeared in the newspapers it did. That's not sensible, it's censorship, plain and simple."
Sherrard said there had been talk that the ASA would refer the case to the Office of Fair Trading and said Ryanair 
would be delighted to deal with that body. ''A sensible independent ruling would be great."
In general terms, Ryanair is well aware that controversy canwork in its favour. Sherrard said it was only when a 
Spanish consumer group objected to the Ryanair 2008 calendar, which featured 12 members of its female cabin 
crew wearing bikinis, that sales of the calendar took off in earnest. In the end the calendar venture raised  70,000, 
which was donated to charity.
The airline has already moved on from Sarkozy. The latest group of people to be offended by a Ryanair ad are the 
civic authorities in Naples, who are upset because Ryanair used pictures of the rubbish mountains that have been 
created outside the city due to problems over local tax collection.
''Pay the taxes," says the ad. ''Not for rubbish collection, but to escape."
''I love Naples," said Sherrard. ''It's beautiful."

Weaker sterling to hit Irish firms

Several Irish companies are expected to face broker downgrades in the coming weeks with the impact of weaker 
sterling set to shave profits for this year.
Greencore, Abbey, Grafton, Kingspan and McInerney all have high levels of exposure to sterling, and market 
sources said it was unlikely that these firms could offset the impact of a slide in the currency.
About 30 per cent of the Iseq's earnings are derived from business done through sterling. Most analysts have 
factored in a sterling rate of 69p to 72p and are re-working their models to factor in the current level of about 75p to 
the euro.
While the weakening of the dollar has been factored in to numbers, the shift in sterling has been sharp and 
unexpected.
This means that some brokers' earnings forecasts will have to be cut by 1 to 3 per cent for a number of companies 
if current sterling levels continue.
A number of companies will give guidance on the impact of sterling when they report in the coming weeks. One 
analyst said that while sterling was an unwelcome headwind, the whole earnings environment has come under 
pressure due to expected negative economic news flow.
Companies in the building sector are particularly vulnerable to the impact of sterling. Kingspan, which issued a 
negative trading statement in December, derives 58 per cent of its earnings from Britain and has been unable to 
give clear guidance for 2008.
Just over half of Grafton's profits come from Britain and 46 per cent of McInerney's earnings are exposed to 
sterling. About 75 per cent of Greencore's earnings come from Britain.
Weaker sterling to hit Irish firms
DCC issued a profit warning last week, which was largely due to the impact of sterling. Readymix also issued a 
profit warning, while Ryanair warned that a number of factors, including the impact of sterling, would impact on 
profits.

The online hotel booking engine set up by businesswoman Sarah Newman and sold for  60 million in 2006, was 
forced to pay Ryanair  10 million when its new owner terminated its contract with the no-frills airline following the 
takeover.
Needahotel, which is now owned by US web software firm Cendant and which also provided a hotel booking 
service for Aer Lingus, terminated its relationship with Ryanair a year after it had agreed a fresh five-year deal with 
the airline. The decision came just months after Cendant completed its takeover of the company.
The ending of the contract meant that Ryanair was left without an online hotel partner for a number of weeks in 
early 2007, while it conducted a search for a replacement.
It later signed a deal with US provider Worldwide Travel Exchange.
Newman, the partner of former Kilkenny hurling star DJ Carey, was estimated to have earned up to  30 million from 
the sale of the company, in which she had a 50 per cent stake.

Ryanair, the airline that depends heavily on internet sales, will not take any new bookings for three days later this 
month as it makes changes to its website.
Europe's biggest low cost airline will close its reservation centre system due to an "essential system 
changeover/upgrade".
The shutdown will allow the website to meet regulations set by the Office of Fair Trading, which said the airline had 
not met its deadline of the end of January to be more transparent over its advertised fares.
Twelve other airlines have made changes to display all fares inclusive of taxes and charges.
Ryanair said there were "several elements" to the website change, one of which was the regulatory requirement. 
Phone bookings will also be unavailable.
The group operates one of Europe's most successful travel websites, www.ryanair.com, but the software system 
has not been completely overhauled since its launch in January 2000. The airline, which has flown 50m passengers 
in the past 12 months, takes 99 per cent of its bookings through the internet, which has been one of the key factors 
in the success of its low-cost airline business model, allowing it to avoid the use of travel agents and global 
distribution systems.
The website will be unavailable for 73 hours from 10pm on February 22 to 11pm on February 25. Flights will be 
unaffected, but passengers wishing to make or change a booking will be unable to during this period.
It comes at a difficult time for the group. This week it left its profit guidance for the current financial year to the end 
of March unchanged for an increase in net profits of 17.5 per cent to Euros 470m (Pounds 351m), but warned that 
profits next year could fall steeply in the face of economic slowdown and very high oil prices.
Ryanair said yesterday it had taken significant additional advance bookings and would take more after the 
shutdown, which would ensure that its bookings, loads and financial results would be unaffected by the shutdown of 
the website.
Ryanair to close bookings for three days as it updates website
Ryanair is remaining with Navitaire, a subsidiary of Accenture, as its main software provider for its reservation and 
distribution system, but it is upgrading from the existing Open Skies system to New Skies, which is already in use at 
more than 12 airlines.
New Skies has one of the world's leading internet direct sales engines and allows greater flexibility in the dynamic 
packaging of other offers to customers.

Mining
BHP Billiton upped the stakes in its campaign to win control of rival Rio Tinto but Rio's board unanimously rejected 
the revised Pounds 75bn all-share offer from the world's biggest mining company. BHP now faces what is likely to 
be a protracted hostile takeover battle as European steelmakers warned they were gearing up to fight its attempts. 
If its approach were to be successful, it would be the second-largest takeover deal after Vodafone's acquisition of 
Mannesmann in 1999.
Travel & Leisure
Punch Taverns approached Mitchells & Butlers with an all-share offer that would create the UK's biggest pub group. 
However, the offer received a cool response from inside its rival pub operator, as shareholders, analysts and 
advisers prepared for a drawn-out battle. The move came after M&B, which owns the All Bar One and Harvester 
chains, disclosed it had closed financial hedges connected to an ill-fated property venture at an after-tax cost of 
Pounds 274m.
Banks
Olivant, the private equity group led by Luqman Arnold, the former chief executive of Abbey National, pulled out of 
plans to rescue Northern Rock an hour before the deadline, in a move that left just two proposals left. Meanwhile, 
Sir Brian Pitman, the man leading Virgin's bid, said taking over the bank was not a ticket for a "gravy train".
Pharmaceuticals
Andrew Witty, the chief executive-designate of GlaxoSmithKline, pledged to diversify the pharmaceuticals group as 
its shares dropped after an earnings warning. Outgoing chief executive Jean-Pierre Garnier said last year's safety 
scares over Avandia, the group's diabetes treatment and its second biggest-selling drug - which wiped Dollars 1bn 
(Pounds 512m) off profits - and further "erosion" of revenues by generics would contribute to a "mid-single digit 
percentage decline" in earnings per share, worse than analysts had expected.
The Week
Oil and & Gas
BP raised its final-quarter dividend by almost a third, to reflect a confident outlook, even though fourth-quarter 
profits fell well short of analysts' expectations. Europe's second-biggest oil company also announced plans to cut 
5,000 jobs by the middle of next year as part of a restructuring plan.
Aerospace
Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost airline, warned its profits could fall by up to 50 per cent in its next financial year 
in the face of rising oil prices, tougher economic conditions and falling fare levels. Michael O'Leary, chief executive, 
said the European airline sector was facing a cyclical downturn with the possibility of higher oil prices, poor 
consumer demand, weaker sterling and higher airport costs.
Real Estate
British Land became the first big property company to reveal the extent of the property downturn after admitting 
more than Pounds 1.3bn had been wiped off its portfolio. The UK's second- largest property company reported a 
pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.32bn in the last quarter after a 16.7 per cent drop in its net asset per share to Pounds 
14.01.
Telecoms
British Sky Broadcasting swung into a loss for the first half. But its new chief executive said the UK's biggest pay-TV 
operator had invested in broadband, as he expressed confidence in its ability to weather a tougher economic 
climate.
Competition in the broadband market led BT Group to miss its quarterly revenue targets, as it unveiled mixed 
quarterly results that pushed its shares down almost 10 per cent. The worst performer was the wholesale division, 
where revenues slipped 11 per cent to Pounds 1.2bn.
Media
Virgin Media backed away from its attempt to reach the 50 per cent of the UK that is not covered by its cables. Neil 
Berkett, acting chief executive, said it had tried to pursue too many strategies at once. Mr Berkett, who has been 
acting chief executive since Steve Burch's unexpected departure in August, defended the decision to change 
course.
Yell shares fell more than 15 per cent, to below their flotation price in 2003, after comments concerning UK 
advertising fuelled investors' fears about the future for its telephone directories.
General Retailers
Lord Harris of Peckham, founder of Carpetright, is to step down as chief executive in a year's time and install his 
son at the helm of the flooring retailer.
Halfords, the car parts and bicycle retailer, is seeking a new chief executive after Ian McLeod resigned to become 
managing director of Coles, the Australian supermarket chain.

Highlight: A stockbroker has forecast a net profit of  E368m  for  Ryanair.
Body
A leading stockbroker has forecast a net profit of E368m for no-frills airline Ryanair in the next year, about half way 
between pessimistic and optimistic scenarios which the carrier projected this week.
Joe Gill, analyst at Goodbody Research, said in a nine page note on the airline, "This package delivers an 
operating profit of E433m. Cashflows and the proceeds of aircraft sales and declining interest rates should further 
alleviate the net interest cost incurred by the company. That provides net profit of E368m (compares to company 
range of E235m-E580m), and EPS of 25.7c assuming a E200m share buyback is completed before the end of the 
current financial year at the prevailing share price."
The broker believes that Ryanair is equipped to endure a tough market while building its share of passenger volume 
across Europe.
 "Given the rate of profit warnings from UK retailers and evidence of an economic slow down in both Ireland and the 
UK, the company is being rightly cautious about overall demand for air travel in summer 2008. "Over the past ten 
years Ryanair's EBIT has never declined and in only one year (2004 - due to the purchase of Buzz and the 
Charleroi affair) was profit flat. This gives us confidence that amid the volatility that is certainly inherent to the airline 
sector, Ryanair has the capacity to perform strongly in all conditions. In FY '09, we argue the scenario of a weak 
economy and stubbornly high oil prices threatens a profit reduction. However, normally oil prices tend to weaken 
amid economic slowdowns and vice-versa. If that comes to pass, the gloomy prognosis for next year could be 
reversed if jet fuel prices fall." For the full year 2010, Mr Gill projects another 19pc lift in passenger volume, with unit 
revenues up 1.6pc and unit costs rising 1.5pc "That will provide a 24pc lift in earnings-per-share, while bringing the 
total passenger count to 72 million," he said.

EasyJet, the UK's leading low-cost airline, has maintained its forecast for a 20 per cent increase in underlying pre-
tax profits in its financial year to the end of September, in stark contrast to the profit warning issued this week by 
rival Ryanair.
The Irish carrier, the largest no-frills airline in Europe measured by passenger numbers, had warned that higher oil 
prices, weakening consumer sentiment and the strong risk of recession could lead to a sharp decline in its profits in 
the year to March 2009 - possibly by as much as 50 per cent.
However, EasyJet said its total revenues per seat had risen "ahead of expectations" by 0.5 per cent in its first 
quarter from October to December, helped by the strength of the euro and the introduction of charges for checked-
in baggage.
Revenues for the current second quarter were also expected "to continue to perform ahead of our original 
expectations", it said.
Forward bookings were "in line with expectations in spite of the uncertain macroeconomic environment".
The carrier derives a significant proportion of its revenues in euros and the group said that most of its growth in 
passenger numbers in the first three months was achieved through its development of markets in continental 
Europe, in particular Italy, Spain and Switzerland.
As a result of the investment in these new operating bases total non-UK originating passengers increased 22 per 
cent in the period. UK-originating passenger numbers rose just 5 per cent.
The airline flew with slightly more empty seats in the first quarter from October to December, with a deterioration in 
the load factor year-on-year from 81.7 to 80.8 per cent.
The trend accelerated in January with a decline of 2.9 percentage points from 74.9 to 72 per cent.
EasyJet maintains robust outlook
However, EasyJet said its forward bookings for February and March showed "an improving trend" and it expected 
only a slight decline in loads for the second quarter, similar to the fall in the first three months. It has cut its lead-in 
fares to stimulate more traffic.
Rising ancillary revenues, including the baggage charges and commission earnings from areas such as hotel 
bookings, car hire and travel insurance, are driving the revenue performance.
While total revenues per seat rose 0.5 per cent in the first quarter, passenger revenues per seat fell 4 per cent due 
to weaker fare levels, but ancillary revenues per seat including bag charges jumped 42.6 per cent.
Overall in the first quarter turnover increased 14.1 per cent to Pounds 418m (Dollars 812m), passenger numbers 
rose 12.4 per cent to 9.1m, while capacity measured by the number of seats rose 13.6 per cent.
EasyJet shares closed 4.91 per cent lower at 426 1/4p.

The group yesterday opened its 19th base in Europe at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport as part of a Euros 600m,

planning to increase the number of aircraft based in France from six to 20 and to double the number of passengers 
on its French routes from 6m in 2007 to 12m in 2011.
As a result of the investment in new operating bases in these regions, total non-UK originating passengers

(ANSA) - Ronchi dei Legionari (Gorizia), February 8 - The northern Italian airport Ronchi dei Legionari registered 
51,000 passengers in January 2008, a rise of 15.7 pct compared to the same period of 2007. 
The growth was mainly attributed to the increase of the number of passengers on flights connecting Ronchi dei 
Legionari to Naples, in the southern Italian region of Campania, Monaco and Tirana.
Giorgio Brandolin, chairman of the airport operator Aeroporto Friuli-Venezia Giulia SpA (Aeroporto Friuli-VG), which 
manages the Ronchi dei Legionari airport, said the growth is a result of a strong advertising campaign.
Italian air carrier Meridiana SpA will launch a flight between Ronchi dei Legionari and Olbia, on the southern Italian 
island of Sardinia on June 13, 2008. Irish low cost airline Ryanair will launch a flight connecting Ronchi dei 
Legionari to Birmingham, UK, on June 18.

Easyjet PLC, Singapore Airlines, Emirates Airlines and Qatar Airline could take up slots freed by Alitalia SpA at 
Milan's Malpensa airport, said SEA airport operating company chairman Giuseppe Bonomi.
SEA, which operates Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, has launched a 1.2 bln eur legal action against Alitalia 
for cutting its flights from Malpensa and ending hub activities at the airport.
'We know that easyJet wants to double its fleet (at Malpensa) by 2008. Non-EU airlines want to increase 
operations, like Singapore Airlines and Emirates Airlines,' said Bonomi.
'Qatar Airline wants to increase frequencies and use some of the slots. But we are talking point-to-point traffic,' he 
said in margins of a conference.
At the conference on Malpensa's future, participants called for Alitalia to call a moratorium for three years on its 
cutbacks so the airport can in the meantime find alternative hub activities.
Bonomi reiterated recent comments that SEA's short to medium plan is to contain losses from Alitalia's withdrawal 
and in the longer-term finding an airline to operate a hub at Malpensa.
Alitalia has already notified to Italy's slot co-ordinator Assoclearance it is giving up the slots for the summer season 
and normally these are reasigned after a few days, Bonomi said.
However, the Lombardy region, which opposes Alitalia's cutbacks, has regulations which can block slot 
reassignment, he said.
SEA rejected Ryanair Holdings PLC's recent proposal to site operations at Malpensa because the airline wanted 
additional discounts, and SEA wants to give fair and equal treatment to all its users, he said.
Bonomi reiterated SEA's legal action has been launched and while a hearing has not yet been fixed this should take 
place in the next few months.
The continued loss of time in resolving Alitalia's exit makes it more difficult to set up a moratorium, he said, noting 
Alitalia has recently changed its ticket sales system.

Bonomi said he could not forecast how many Alitalia's slots would be reassigned, adding it is 'unthinkable' that all 
will be taken up.

Highlight: Renewed economic worries drove the Dublin market lower today

Renewed economic worries drove the Dublin market lower today after a rate cut by the Bank of England and a 
more dovish tone from the European Central Bank 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 117.38 points at 6456.69
The Bank of England cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point yesterday, raising new concerns 
that the cooling U.S. economy could be affecting economies abroad, but also raising hopes that such measures will 
limit the impact of a slowdown.
 Meanwhile, European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet warned of an 'unusually high uncertainty' about 
the overall impact of the financial market crisis on the real economy. Speaking after his bank left eurozone rates 
unchanged today, he said that economic data up to the end of 2007 pointed to a more moderate pace of growth in 
the zone than in the third quarter of last year. He said that economic fundamentals in the eurozone were sound but 
incoming data showed, he said, that there were downside risks to this outlook. However, EU internal markets 
commissioner Charlie McCreevy has said that recent turmoil in global financial markets has given a 'reality check' to 
the industry and said it has shown the resilience and strong fundamentals of the EU economy. 'The EU economy 
will not escape from the impact of the financial crisis and the US slow-down. But the EU fundamentals appear to be 
better,' he said at a speech in Chatham House, London. 'For the moment the EU economy seems to be quite 
resilient,' he added, noting that economists do not expect 'a full blown recession'. He said it 'is incumbent on all 
leading policy makers and business the world over to work together to minimise financial risk in the future,' adding 
that 'anything less would be totally irresponsible' Bank of Ireland was down 5c at 9.54 and AIB fell 13c at 14.57. 
Anglo Irish Bank was down 14c at 9.71 and Irish Life and Permanent remained unchanged at 10.70. In the 
construction sector, McInerney was unchanged at 1.59 and Kingspan slipped 14c to 8.66. CRH was up 23c to 
24.25 and Grafton was down 5c to 5.43. Elsewhere, bookmaker Paddy Power was up E1.00 to 21.25 and no-frills 
airline Ryanair dropped 2c to 3.50. Other notable movers include ICG up 45c to 23.60, Smurfit Kappa up 3c to 8.98, 
ISEQ closes lower on economic concerns
and IAWS up 19c to 13.00. Also, shares at Irish pharmaceutical company Elan were down 15c to 17.47 after 
Biogen Idec reported, in its Q407 results that the number of patients on Tysabri by the end of the year (20,400 in 
total, with 12,900 in the US and the remainder in Europe) equated to total worldwide sales in the quarter of USD129 
million. Annual sales came in at USD343 million, in line with Goodbody's forecast. "We will, therefore, not be 
making any changes to our Tysabri numbers, holding FY08 and FY09 revenue at USD1.1 billion and USD2.1 billion 
respectively," Ian Hunter, analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers said. Separately, a letter in the New England Journal 
of Medicine reports two cases of melanoma in patients taking Tysabri. Biogen Idec noted in its conference call 
yesterday that melanoma was observed during Tysabri clinical trials but that the incidence in patients taking Tysabri 
was the same as in those on the placebo.

British judge orders Ryanair to pay band kicked off flight over terror fear

A British judge has ordered budget airline Ryanair to pay $7,800 to members of a calypso band who were ordered 
off a plane at gunpoint after another passenger said they were acting suspiciously.
Ryanair said it had not decided whether to appeal the ruling.
Five members of the London-based Caribbean Steel International band were aboard a flight waiting to fly from the 
island of Sardinia to London on Dec. 31, 2006, when a passenger alerted the crew of "suspicious" behavior.
The band members were sitting separately on the plane, even though they had been together in the departure 
lounge, the passenger reported.
The men were removed from the plane by Italian police with guns drawn, though they were later cleared by airport 
security. The pilot refused to let them back onboard, citing the "anxiety" of the other passengers.
District Judge Roger Southcombe ruled Tuesday that the men had been unreasonably removed from the plane. He 
awarded them $1,570 each in damages.
In the judgment, Southcombe said the damages awarded reflected the band members' "embarrassment at being 
the only black persons removed from the aircraft at gunpoint for no just reason, their inability to be with their families 
and friends on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day (and) the overnight stay in the cold in Liverpool."
The men were flown to Liverpool and spent the night of Jan. 1 outside the bus station after missing the last bus to 
London.

Highlight: DCC shares plunged another 3pc today
Body
DCC shares plunged another 3pc today after the company said that currency turbulence would hit its earnings this 
year.
The ISEQ in index of Irish shares closed down 41.56 points at 6574.07. 
The business support group said it expects a strong fourth quarter but warned of negative effects from currency 
movements.
 Goodbody Stockbrokers said they have lowered their forecasts for the group to "incorporate both the impact of a 
weaker sterling and the higher than forecasted net debt". Taking into account trading in January and the outlook for 
February and March, strong growth in group operating profit is anticipated for the fourth quarter, DCC said. 
However, the adverse impact of the current sterling / euro exchange rate on the translation of DCC's sterling profits 
into euro will reduce the rate of growth, it said. Meanwhile, banking shares were mixed. Bank of Ireland was down 
28c at 9.52 and AIB climbed 14c to 14.64. Anglo Irish Bank was up 7c at 9.72 and Irish Life and Permanent rose 
36c to 10.76. In the construction sector, McInerney was down 2c at 1.58 and Kingspan slipped 28c to 8.84. CRH 
was up 6c to 24.83 and Grafton rose 10c to 5.48. CRH declined by almost 8pc yesterday, partly due to concerns

Tullow down 34c to 7.76, Ryanair up 2c to 3.54. Also, shares at Independent News and Media were down 3c to

advertising at a national and regional level is a concern, as is DMGT's statement that it is 'too early to predict the 
outcome of the full year," according to Conor Duffy, analyst at Davy Research. Meanwhile, shares at Ormonde 
Mining slipped 2c to 0.12 after it announced the results of its feasibility study at its la Zarza project in south-west 
Spain. The study showed that the mine and plant design the study proposes have high capital costs (E89m) with a 
large proportion of fixed costs. These are related to inflation in capital assets in the mining industry and the 
complexity of the plant to recover all the metals contained in the deposit. However, the study suggests that two 
alternative development routes should be considered: a higher throughput option or a smaller scale project, at least 
in the initial stages. Inhouse work, using the data and studies included in the work reported, is underway to look at 
these options.

Newlyweds Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni have endured their first major test as a couple, and they have passed.
Sarkozy, the French president, and Bruni won their case against Ryanair for using their picture in an advertisement 
without permission.
Ryanair, sensing a good publicity moment, ran the cheeky advert in a French newspaper featuring the couple, with 
a bubble appearing from the former model's mouth: "With Ryanair, now my whole family can come to my wedding."
Bruni had asked a court for Euros 500,000, saying this is what she typically earns for appearing in an 
advertisement. But the Paris court awarded her only Euros 60,000. Sarkozy was given the symbolic Euros 1 that he 
had sought.
Does the court's judgment say something about the relative value of the image of a president's wife to that of a 
fashion model?
Or did the court simply find some sympathy with Ryanair, which apologised before the case went to court?
In any case, Ryanair was also ordered to publish its verdict in the newspaper that carried the offending advert.
The publicity-savvy low-cost airline would be wise to play it straight down the middle this time.

French court orders Ryanair to pay presidential couple over ad

President Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife, Carla Bruni, won a lawsuit against Irish low-cost airline Ryanair, which was 
ordered to pay nearly $89,000 for an advertisement featuring a photo of the couple.
Sarkozy and Bruni filed separate lawsuits that were heard together in a court session in Paris, seeking damages for 
the carrier's use of the image for commercial purposes without permission.
Bruni, a former model turned singer, was awarded nearly $89,000. She had sought a more than $741,000. Sarkozy 
asked for a symbolic one euro worth $1.47 which the court granted.
Thierry Herzog, a lawyer for the couple, said Bruni had decided to donate the court award to Restos du Coeur a 
network of charity soup kitchens well-known in France. Herzog called the ruling "satisfactory."
Airline spokesman Peter Sherrard also said the case had been "settled satisfactorily," and that Ryanair had offered 
to double-up by giving another sum worth nearly $89,000 to a charity of Sarkozy's choice because of the 
extraordinary publicity generated by the advertisement.
The advertisement, which appeared in Le Parisien newspaper on Jan. 28, shows Sarkozy and Bruni gazing 
skyward, with a think bubble over Bruni's head reading, "With Ryanair, my whole family will be able to attend my 
wedding."
Ryanair said late last month that it had sent a written apology to the president with a promise not to publish the ad 
again and an offer to donate the equivalent of $7,400 to his favorite charity. It made a similar offer to Bruni plus a 
symbolic euro but rejected her claim for more than $741,000 as "totally unjustified."
Sarkozy and Bruni were married on Saturday.

The banks and a share tumble by bookmaker Paddy Power dragged the Dublin market lower today
At 11.20am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 138.05 points at 6771.09
The ISEQ shed a further 3.9pc in January, bringing its 12-month loss to 27.6pc. This represents the worst January 
performance since 2002, according to Davy Research. 
 Financials were the hardest hit, down 6.8pc, while industrials lost 1.7pc, it said. Nevertheless, the January outcome 
for the ISEQ represents an outperformance of 8.9pc over the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index, making the ISEQ the top-
performing developed market in Europe for the month. The Fed's two interest rate cuts, which totalled 125 basis 
points, failed to supply the hoped-for rally as concerns regarding the US economy remain, it said. All US 
benchmarks and developed European markets ended the month in negative territory. There were losses across all 
sectors as only one of the FTSE E300 sub-sectors and three of the S and P 500 sub-sectors advanced in January. 
The ISEQ has recently generated some positive technical signals, suggesting that momentum may be shifting 
positively, it said. Bank of Ireland was down 20c at 10.01 and AIB slipped 24c to 14.83. Anglo Irish Bank slipped 
35c to 9.79 In the construction sector, McInerney was down 2c at 1.57 and Kingspan slipped 2c to 9.65. CRH was 
down 90c to 26.00 and Grafton dropped 10c to 5.50 Elsewhere, bookmaker Paddy Power plunged 96c to 20.04 and 
shares at Irish pharmaceutical company Elan were up 10c to 18.01. Other notable movers include DCC fell 44c to 
18.44, Kerry Group down 42c to 18.56, Ryanair down 2c to 3.52. Shares at Qualceram Shires were unchanged at 
0.90 after it announced that it has completed the disposal of its 13-acre Arklow property. The final consideration 
amounted to E30.025m in cash. The property, which was sold to Brattice Properties Ltd, was expected to change 
hands for E31m, but this had to be adjusted to reflect the fact that a road adjacent to the property had not been in 
the charge of Arklow urban council. The property has a book value of E10m, so the net gain to Qualceram is just 
over E20m or 90c a share. This is, however, before tax and the costs of relocation. The net proceeds will be set 
ISEQ lower on banks, Paddy Power
against group debt. The group will continue to occupy the site until an alternative location is chosen and developed. 
This is expected to take up to two years.

operations are expected to take up to 9 weeks. In the success case, the partners are not planning to flow test the 
well but to install production casing and suspend the well as a possible future producer. Also, shares at 
Independent News and Media were down 4c to 2.15 after the launch of two new local titles in the south-east of 
Ireland today. The Waterford People and Dungarvan People are compact format newspapers that will cater for a 
market of c.100,000 people and will have an initial cover price of E1.60 These will increase INM's portfolio of 
regional titles in the Irish market to 15 (assuming the acquisition of The Sligo Champion is cleared by the 
competition authorities). "We expect these launches to have a minimal effect on the group, which has over 180 
titles spanning four continents," Philip O'Sullivan, analyst at Goodbody Research said.

Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost airline, warned yesterday its profits could fall by as much as 50 per cent in its 
next financial year in the face of a "perfect storm" of rising oil prices, tougher economic conditions and falling fare 
levels.
Its share price fell more than 12 per cent in early trade but recovered to close eight cents, or 2.2 per cent, lower at 
Euros 3.52.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said the European airline sector was facing a cyclical downturn with the possibility 
of higher oil prices, poor consumer demand, weaker sterling and higher airport costs.
The Irish carrier, which has a record of issuing bearish forecasts, said it had virtually no hedging protection in place 
for its fuel requirements for the coming year to March 2009. Several analysts lowered their profit forecasts for next 
year.
Mr O'Leary said it was too early "in such volatile markets" to make any accurate forecasts for the next financial year 
but with oil prices at Dollars 90 a barrel and fear of recession in the UK and many other European economies, the 
current outlook for the coming year was "poor".
The group's "most optimistic" scenario was for a combination of flat yields (average fares) and crude oil prices at 
Dollars 75, which would result in profits rising further next year by six per cent to approximately Euros 500m.
However, if forward oil prices remained at Dollars 85, and consumer sentiment and sterling weakness led to a five 
per cent reduction in yields, profits in the coming year could fall by as much as 50 per cent to as low as Euros 235m 
(excluding profits from aircraft disposals).
It would be only the second time the airline has suffered a fall in profits since flotation in 1997.
Ryanair's "only one competitive response to any consumer uncertainty" would be to intensify a price war, said Mr 
O'Leary, with moves "to slash fares and yields, stimulate traffic, encourage price-sensitive consumers and promote 
new routes and base developments."
Ryanair warns of 'perfect storm' damage
It repeated its previous guidance for the full year to March 2008 for a 17.5 per cent increase in net profits to 
approximately Euros 470m. Pre-tax profits in the first nine months from April to December rose 20.5 per cent from 
Euros 423.4m to Euros 510m, while net profits increase 20.6 per cent to Euros 454.8m. In the third quarter, 
underlying profits fell 10 per cent excluding aircraft sales.

Ryanair has a long tradition of ominous prognostications which fail to be fulfilled. Yesterday Europe's largest low-
cost airline announced below-consensus third-quarter results and gave a particularly pessimistic forecast of things 
to come. Is the gloom, for once, justified?
UK airlines, according to Ryanair, face a "perfect storm" of high oil prices, slowing consumer demand and sterling 
weakness. If forward oil prices remain at Dollars 85 a barrel and average fares fall 5 per cent, the airline says the 
next financial year's profits could be halved. Ryanair's lack of cheer is shared by the industry body IATA, which 
recently lowered its industry profit forecast for 2008 from Dollars 7.8bn to Dollars 5bn, albeit with US airlines 
bearing the brunt.
European airlines, though, cannot just blame a deteriorating external environment. In spite of ferocious competition, 
all are increasing short-haul capacity, with Ryanair itself leading the pack. Although passenger numbers have, so 
far, held up well, signs of strain are appearing. Air Berlin, Spain's Vueling and SAS have all either delayed or 
cancelled orders, or handed back leased planes early, according to Morgan Stanley, and ailing Alitalia may scale 
down its operations. Indeed, the sufferings of weaker competitors could help Ryanair if they result in declining 
capacity. And it has other cushions - ancillary revenues, for example, from car hire are growing fast.
Ryanair's verbal expressions of gloom are not backed up by its actions. It is planning a new share buyback 
programme in spite of having net debt - if only to the tune of Euros 18m - for the first time in its 11-year history as a 
listed company. During the last downturn, following September 11 2001, Ryanair was able to use its muscle to 
extract favourable deals from squeezed suppliers. Investors have good reason to hope that, this time round, its 
rhetoric will once again not be matched by reality.

Carla Bruni after the pair won a lawsuit against the airline for using a photo of the couple in an ad campaign.
The Paris court ordered Ryanair to pay Bruni 60,000 eur in damages, well short of the 500,000 euros she was 
seeking for the unauthorised use of her image. Sarkozy was awarded a symbolic sum of one euro in damages, as 
he had requested.

Vestas Wind Systems of Denmark yesterday raised its outlook for 2007 sales and profit margins and so boosted 
alternative energy stocks.
Vestas, the world's biggest wind turbine manufacturer, surged 7.7 per cent to DKr536 after it said strong sales 
development in the fourth quarter had prompted it to raise its revenue estimate to Euros 4.85bn from Euros 4.5bn.
Renewable energy stocks, which have fallen sharply in weeks, rallied on speculation that the sector had reached a 
bottom. "Almost all the renewable energy sector was oversold quite aggressively over the past four weeks," said 
Torben Sommer, an alternative energy analyst at Piper Jaffray. He said bid speculation was helping stocks bounce 
back. In Spain there was talk that energy group Iberdrola could mount a takeover of Gamesa or Solaria , the 
renewable energy groups, in a bid to shore up its position against a hostile approach. Solaria, a specialist in solar 
panels, gained 8.3 per cent to Euros 17.41, and Gamesa, which makes turbines and solar panels, rose 3.5 per cent 
to Euros 27.42.
EDF , the French utility group that together with Spanish construction group ACS has been considering a takeover 
of Iberdrola, fell 1.6 per cent to Euros 67.87. Iberdrola fell 1.4 per cent to Euros 10.22.
Solar panel groups benefited from expectations that demand for renewable energy would rise on the back of higher 
oil prices and amid mounting concerns about greenhouse gas emissions. Norway's Renewable Energy Corp rose 
4.1 per cent to NKr145.75, while Germany's Q-Cells added 2.4 per cent to Euros 65.50.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended 0.2 per cent higher at 1,356.20 points, having fallen after US stock markets opened 
lower. Frankfurt's Xetra Dax rose 0.5 per cent to 7,000.49. The CAC 40 in Paris lost 0.1 per cent to 4,973.64.
France's biggest faller was Societe Generale , down 4.8 per cent to Euros 83.61 amid talk of a discounted rights 
issue this week. Ryanair, the Irish budget airline, fell 2.2 per cent to Euros 3.52 after it reported a 27 per cent fall in 
third-quarter net profit.

Standard Life ethical funds will no longer invest in airlines after a survey of its investors revealed a significant 
portion opposed to such stocks.
Standard Life Investments (SLI) announced the policy change following the results of its latest survey of its ethical 
investors, in which 30% of respondents said they would prefer its ethical funds not to invest in airlines.
'In light of the sizeable percentage of our investors wishing to avoid investment in airlines, the [Standard Life] 
Ethical Committee has decided that our ethical policy should be adapted to reflect these views,' said Julie 
McDowell, head of sustainable and responsible investment at SLI.
'I am sure that investors welcome the fact that they play an important part in helping to shape our ethical fund 
criteria.'
SLI has withdrawn all its investments in airline stocks from its ethical funds as a result of the decision.
Standard Life Investments currently manages £588.5 million over its ethical fund range, which includes the UK 
Ethical, Ethical Corporate Bond, European Equity Ethical, Life Ethical and Pension Ethical funds.
Standard Life investor's ethical stance on airlines has also coincided with a seeming downturn in prospects for the 
European airline sector.
Low-cost airline Ryanair has warned its profits could fall by up to 50% in its next financial year, and cautioned that 
the European airline sector was facing a downturn.
The possibility of higher oil prices, poor consumer demand, weaker sterling and higher airport costs were all 
reasons for gloom, said chief executive Michael O'Leary.

development in the fourth quarter had prompted it to raise its revenue estimate to Euros 4.85bn from a previous 
Euros 4.5bn.
Renewable energy stocks, which have fallen sharply in recent weeks, rallied across the board on speculation that 
the sector had reached a bottom.
"Almost all the renewable energy sector was oversold quite aggressively over the past four weeks," said Torben 
Sommer, an alternative energy analyst at Piper Jaffray. He said bid speculation was also helping stocks bounce 
back.
The buzz in Spain was that energy group Iberdrola could mount a takeover of Gamesa or Solaria , the renewable 
energy companies, in a bid to shore up its position against a hostile approach. Solaria, which specialises in solar 
panels, gained 8.3 per cent to Euros 17.41, and Gamesa, which makes both turbines and solar panels, rose 3.5 per 
cent to Euros 27.42.
EDF , the French utility group that together with Spanish construction group ACS has been considering a takeover 
of Iberdrola, fell 1.6 per cent to Euros 67.87. Iberdrola retreated 1.4 per cent to Euros 10.22.
Solar panel groups benefited from expectations that demand for renewable energy would rise on the back of higher 
oil prices and amid mounting concerns about greenhouse gas emissions. Norway's Renewable Energy Corp rose 
4.1 per cent to NKr145.75, while Germany's Q-Cells added 2.4 per cent to Euros 65.50.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended the day 0.2 per cent higher at 1,356.20, having slipped from its highs after US stock 
markets opened lower. Frankfurt's Xetra Dax rose 0.5 per cent to 7,000.49, and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 0.1 per 
cent to 4,973.64.
Vestas Wind Systems breezes forward
France's biggest faller was Societe Generale, which dropped 4.8 per cent to Euros 83.61 amid expectations of a 
discounted rights issue later in the week.
Ryanair, the Irish budget airline, fell 2.2 per cent to Euros 3.52 after it reported a 27 per cent fall in third-quarter net 
profit and warned of weaker profit next year.
"The European airline sector is presently facing a cyclical downturn," the company said, warning of a "perfect 
storm" of high fuel costs, poor consumer demand and weaker sterling.
Other budget airline groups suffered. Air Berlin fell 2.5 per cent to Euros 11.27, and Spain's Vueling Airlines shed 
0.1 per cent to Euros 9.19.
Alitalia rose 4.8 per cent to Euros 0.69 after smaller Italian airline Air One said it was preparing a bid with other 
Italian investors for the struggling carrier. Air France-KLM , which is currently in talks with Alitalia, closed 0.1 per 
cent higher at Euros 19.01.
German steelmaker Salzgitter rose 4 per cent to Euros 115.50 after Credit Suisse lifted its price target to Euros 189 
from Euros 150 and kept its "outperform" rating.
The broker said: "We believe Salzgitter is a very cheap stock in a very strong global steel market and is a strong 
play on the risk of a global steel shortage."
Shares in Inmobiliaria Colonial jumped 8.4 per cent to Euros 1.67 after the Investment Corporation of Dubai said 
the main two shareholders in the Spanish property firm had agreed to sell if the Dubai fund launched a takeover bid.
Real estate peers were also strong, with Astroc rising 0.63 per cent to Euros 3.68, and Renta Corp ticking up 1.2 
per cent to Euros 13.50.

In a report on asset managers, Evolution Securities continues to favour Ashmore and Man Group as buys. It 
remains wary on Henderson Group and reduces the target price to 110p from 120p.

Ryanair, the leading European low-cost airline, warned yesterday there was a "significant chance" its profits would 
fall next year and could drop by as much as 50 per cent.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said the European airline sector was "presently facing one of these 
cyclical downturns, with the possibility of a 'perfect storm' of higher oil prices, poor consumer demand, weaker

Ryanair shares drop over warning of tough 2008, high fuel costs
Ryanair shares drop over warning of tough 2008, high fuel costs

Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC plummeted Monday after Europe's top no-frills airline reported flat third-quarter 
profits and warned of tough times ahead because of high fuel costs and fears of a recession.
Ryanair's reliably brash chief executive said the carrier welcomes a global recession because it would put 
competitors under more pressure, force governments to abandon plans for environmental airline levies, and 
strengthen his company's hand.
"We need a recession," CEO Michael O'Leary said at a news conference. "I think it would be great for the aviation 
industry."
For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Ryanair said its net profit fell 1 percent to 47.2 million euros ($69.9 million). Sales 
rose 16 percent to 569 million euros ($842.7 million), while passenger numbers rose 21 percent to 12.4 million, 
reflecting the carrier's relentless expansion in Europe.
Excluding a 12.2 million euro ($17.9 million) boost from the sale of five Boeing 737-800 aircraft, quarterly profits fell 
27 percent, in line with analyst expectations.
O'Leary reiterated that the carrier expects full-year profit will rise 17.5 percent to 470 million euros ($695.6 million) 
but that it expects much tighter margins beginning April.
In a statement, O'Leary warned of the possibility of higher oil prices, falling consumer demand, a weaker British 
currency and higher airport charges.
But at a press conference, O'Leary said Ryanair would take advantage of the downturn by discounting fares and 
build market share at the expense of rivals. He noted that Ryanair was the best-funded airline in Europe with cash 
reserves exceeding 2 billion euros ($3 billion) and that there were no plans to slow route expansion or the purchase 
of aircraft.
Ryanair, which operates a 130-aircraft fleet composed entirely of Boeing 737s, is committed to buying 100 more by 
2012.
Ryanair shares drop over warning of tough 2008, high fuel costs
Ryanair shares fell 14 percent in the first hour of trade on the Irish Stock Exchange, but rebounded following 
O'Leary's comments to close at 3.52 euros ($5.21), off 2.2 percent for the day.
Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin said Ryanair's forecast "rings alarm bells," but that the airline remained the best 
positioned in the industry to exploit a weakening market.
Ryanair had negotiated fuel-supply contracts when the price of oil was below $70 a barrel. But O'Leary said Ryanair 
now had virtually no fuel-hedging contracts in place beyond March.
His "most conservative" forecast based on oil at $85 a barrel, falling consumer demand and a weakening British 
pound suggested net profit could be cut in half to 235 million euros ($347.8 million).
O'Leary said Ryanair was committed to boosting its income by raising fees for conventional check-in, checked 
luggage, and in other areas.
O'Leary said the airline hoped to spur more passengers to rely solely on carryon luggage and Internet check-ins.
Many people cannot check in over the Web, however, including those holding non-European Economic Area 
passports, disabled passengers, unaccompanied minors and large tour groups.

Leading shares look set to open higher this morning, taking encouragement from a strong end to a good week on 
Wall Street, while the Bank of England's interest rate decision on Thursday will provide the focus this week.
Spread bettors IG Index expect the FTSE 100 index to open around 31 points higher at 6,060, having closed up 
149.4 at 6,029.2 on Friday.
In the US, Wall Street capped a week of big gains with another sizable advance Friday after investors set aside 
anxiety over news that the economy lost jobs last month and focused on Microsoft Corp's bid for Internet company 
Yahoo Inc.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.83 points, to 12,743.19 after climbing more than 200 points Thursday.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 16.87, or 1.22 pct, to 1,395.42, and the Nasdaq composite index advanced 
23.50, or 0.98 pct, to 2,413.36.
Today in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 closed up 362.54 points or 2.7 pct at 13,859.70, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng 
was up 752.88 points 3.1 pct at 24,876.46, by midday.
Meanwhile, oil traded flat in Asia on Monday after concerns for the US economy appeared to outweigh the impact of 
OPEC's decision to hold output steady.
New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in March, was 3 cents lower at 88.93 usd a barrel.
Brent North Sea crude for March delivery was up 2 cents at 89.46 usd.
In macro news, the Bank of England's interest rate decision on Thursday will dominate an otherwise quiet week for 
UK data.
The central bank is widely expected to set aside inflationary concerns to deliver a quarter point reduction, in the 
face of slowing economic growth and concerns about the ongoing financial market turmoil.
Turning to corporate news, Northern Rock enters a critical phase today, as the deadline for bids for the stricken 
mortgage-bank finally arrives.
London shares outlook - up, after NY surge Friday; BoE rate decision in focus
Investors will be digesting low-cost airline Ryanair's third quarter numbers this morning, with the company reporting 
third quarter profits fell by 27 pct and warned profits for next year could decline by as much as 50 pct..
Meanwhile, there may be some interest in blue-chip retailer Kingfisher after it was upgraded to 'buy' from 'hold' at 
Deutsche Bank, with an increased price target of 185 pence from 155 this morning, according to market sources.
In weekend press talk, the Sunday Telegraph reported that prospective buyers from Asia, Europe and South 
America, including one of China's biggest state-controlled banks, has made secret approaches to buy Glencore's 
14 bln stg stake in Xstrata.
In further M&A talk, Punch Taverns has tabled a secret all-share proposal to swallow Mitchells & Butlers, its 
embattled rival, according to the Sunday Telegraph.
While the Observer said the Chinese government is preparing to launch an unprecedented legal challenge against 
BHP Billiton's planned 130 bln usd takeover bid for Rio Tinto. Wednesday is the deadline for BHP's to bid for Rio, 
which is also the day BHP report results.
The same paper suggested three private equity groups are pondering a 3 bln stg bid for ITV.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank predict British Land will reveal this week that net asset value will have plunged by more 
than 16 pct since the end of September, said the Sunday Times.
Among smaller the companies reporting results today is specialist recruiter Sthree. The company warned in 
November that full-year results would be around 3 mln stg below consensus estimates, blaming unusually high 
levels of investment and one-off systems related costs.
Meanwhile, year to Dec 2007 sales at Wolfson Microelectronics could possibly still come in towards the higher end 
of the 226 mln usd-232 mln revenue guidance range this morning, according to Landsbanki's Dan Ridsdale.

Shares at Europe's leading no-frills airline tumble on warning of tough 2008

Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC plummeted Monday after Europe's top no-frills airline reported flat third-quarter 
profits and warned of tough times ahead because of high fuel costs and fears of a recession.
For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Ryanair said its net profit fell 1 percent to 47.2 million euros ($69.9 million). Sales 
rose 16 percent to 569 million euros ($842.7 million), while passenger numbers rose 21 percent to 12.4 million, 
reflecting the carrier's relentless expansion of routes across Europe.
However, Ryanair noted that its net profit included a 12.2 million euro ($17.9 million) boost from the sale of five 
Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Excluding the sale, quarterly net profit fell 27 percent, in line with analyst expectations.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary reiterated Ryanair's forecast that full-year profit would rise 17.5 percent to 470 
million euros ($695.6 million) but emphasized his fears of a worsening environment from April onward.
O'Leary said it was "too early to make any accurate forecasts in such volatile markets for 2008-09." But he warned 
that the airline industry could be hit by higher oil prices, falling consumer demand, a weaker British currency and 
higher airport charges at Ryanair's biggest hubs, London Stansted and Dublin.
Ryanair shares were down less than a percent to close at 3.54 euros ($5.24) on the Irish Stock Exchange Monday 
after falling to a new 52-week low of 3.05 euros ($4.52).
Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin said O'Leary's forecast "rings alarm bells," but emphasized that Ryanair 
remained cash-rich and the best positioned among European airlines to exploit a weak market.
O'Leary noted that, in recent years of rising oil prices, Ryanair had benefited from advance contracts on fuel 
supplies. Those contracts have expired, however, he said.
The best scenario for the April 2008-March 2009 fiscal year would involve flat ticket prices and average fuel costs 
based on $75 a barrel, O'Leary said, about $14 below their current levels. That could produce a 6 percent gain in 
net profit to 500 million euros ($740 million).
Shares at Europe's leading no-frills airline tumble on warning of tough 2008
His "most conservative" forecast based on oil at $85 a barrel, falling consumer demand and a weakening British 
pound suggested net profit could be cut in half to 235 million euros ($347.8 million).
Ryanair said the airline was mulling a fourth-quarter buyback of approximately 200 million euros ($300 million) 
shares. Analysts noted that Ryanair would be able to buy more shares for its money if it talked down its share price.

O'Leary said it was "too early to make any accurate forecasts in such volatile markets for 2008-09." But he warned 
that the airline industry could be hit by "a perfect storm" of higher oil prices, falling consumer demand, a weaker 
British currency and higher airport charges at Ryanair's biggest hubs, London Stansted and Dublin.
Ryanair shares fell more than 13 percent in the first hour of trade on the Irish Stock Exchange to €3.12 (US$4.62), a

O'Leary noted that, in recent years of rising oil prices, Ryanair had benefited from discounted advance contracts on

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Low-fares airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said its third-quarter profits fell by 27 pct 
and warned profits for next year could decline by as much as 50 pct.
The Dublin-based carrier saw its Q3 profit after tax fall to 35 mln eur from 48 mln eur last time distorted by a one-off

decline was roughly 10 pct.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Air One, the Italian airline owned by businessman Carlo Toto, is preparing to bid 
for Alitalia in the near term, in conjunction with a number of Italian partners, the carrier said in a statement

'In these days we're working to avoid losing our flag carrier and (Milan's) Malpensa airport... Our proposal is the 
only one that defends the real interests of Alitalia, its shareholders, the country, and Malpensa,' it said.

American shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC fell to an annual low Monday after the Irish airline said higher oil prices 
and weaker demand could erode its profits.
Ryanair said those factors, along with a weaker British pound and economic weakness, will thin its profit margins. 
After April, the company's contracts are not hedged against the price of oil, and Chief Executive Michael O'Leary 
said profits could be cut in half if the price of oil averages $85 per barrel.
American Depositary Receipts of Ryanair fell $2.88, or 8.7 percent, to $30.34, and hit a low of $27.81. That was 
Ryanair's lowest price since September 2006. Trading was almost four times heavier than the stock's 100-day 
average.
American Depositary Receipts, or ADRs, are securities that allow U.S. investors to trade shares of companies 
based overseas.
Avondale Partners analyst Bob McAdoo suggested investors were overreacting, as the company laid out a variety 
of possibilities for fiscal 2009 without giving a specific forecast.
"We see Ryanair comments as similar to previous comments, wherein the company encourages investors to worry 
about possible weakness, only to have the company exceed expectations," he said. "The press and investors seem 
to be focusing on the worst possible case."
McAdoo kept a "Market Outperform" rating on the stock. Ryanair's fiscal year begins in April.
The Bank of New York Europe ADR index, an index of European stocks trading on U.S. exchanges, declined 1.17 
points to 172.74 in afternoon trading.

US Factory orders rise in December
WASHINGTON (AP) - US factories saw demand for their products rise in December by the largest amount in five 
months, a spot of welcome news that failed to change the picture of an economy struggling to stay afloat.
The Commerce Department reported Monday that orders placed with U.S. factories rose by 2.3 percent in 
December. That was an improvement from the 1.7 percent gain posted in November and marked the biggest 
increase since July.

Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC dropped Monday after Europe's top budget airline reported lower third-quarter 
profits and warned of tough times ahead because of high fuel costs and recessionary fears.
But, in his trademark brash style, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary declared that his company would 
welcome a global recession because it would put his competitors under more pressure, force governments to 
abandon plans for environmental levies on airlines, and strengthen Ryanair's hand in the long run.
"I don't know why we are trying to avert a recession. We need a recession. I think it would be great for the aviation 
industry," O'Leary told a London news conference.
For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Ryanair said its net profit fell 1 percent to €47.2 million (US$69.9 million). Sales rose 
16 percent to €569 million (US$842.7 million), while passenger numbers rose 21 percent to 12.4 million, reflecting 
the carrier's relentless expansion of routes across Europe.
However, Ryanair noted that its net profit received a €12.2 million (US$17.9 million) boost from the sale of five 
Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Excluding this exceptional event, quarterly net profit fell 27 percent, in line with analysts' 
expectations.
O'Leary reiterated Ryanair's forecast that full-year profit would rise 17.5 percent to €470 million (US$695.6 million) 
but Ryanair expected to face much tighter margins from April onward.
In a statement, O'Leary warned that the airline industry could be hit by "a perfect storm" of higher oil prices, falling 
consumer demand, a weaker British currency and higher airport charges at Ryanair's biggest hubs, London 
Stansted and Dublin.
But at his press conference, O'Leary said Ryanair planned to take advantage of the downturn by discounting fares 
and building market share at the expense of rivals. He noted that Ryanair was the best-funded airline in Europe with 
cash reserves exceeding €2 billion (US$3 billion) and had no plans to slow its route expansion or purchase of 
aircraft.
Ryanair shares drop over warning of tough 2008, high fuel costs
Ryanair, which operates a 130-aircraft fleet composed entirely of Boeing 737s, is committed to buying 100 more of 
the planes by 2012. It is planning to sell 10 of its older aircraft this year.
Ryanair shares fell 14 percent in the first hour of trade on the Irish Stock Exchange, but rebounded following 
O'Leary's bullish comments to close at €3.52 (US$5.21), off 2.2 percent for the day.
Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin said Ryanair's forecast "rings alarm bells," but the airline remained best 
positioned in the industry to exploit any weakening market.
Ryanair in recent years has negotiated mammoth fuel-supply contracts several months in advance at moments 
when the price of oil fell below US$70 a barrel. As a result Ryanair has been receiving fuel at a heavy discount but 
that could be about to change.
O'Leary said Ryanair had virtually no fuel-hedging contracts in place beyond March and was unlikely to cut any new 
deals unless oil falls below US$80 a barrel. Oil was hovering around the US$89 mark Monday.
"I think we'll find it much harder to buck higher oil prices," O'Leary said.
He said the best scenario for the April 2008-March 2009 fiscal year would involve flat ticket prices and average fuel 
costs based on US$75 a barrel. This would produce a 6 percent gain in net profit to €500 million (US$740 million).
His "most conservative" forecast based on oil at US$85 a barrel, falling consumer demand and a weakening British 
pound suggested net profit could be cut in half to €235 million (US$347.8 million).
Ryanair said it was mulling a fourth-quarter buyback of approximately €200 million (US$300 million) shares.
O'Leary said Ryanair was committed to boosting its income by raising prices on ticket add-ons and ancillary 
services, including recently increased fees for conventional check-ins, checked luggage, and the use of credit or 
debit cards to book flights.
O'Leary said the airline hoped to spur more passengers to rely solely on carry-on luggage and Internet check-ins, 
which incur no charges.
Many categories of travelers cannot check in over the Web, however, including people holding non-European 
Economic Area passports, disabled passengers, unaccompanied minors and large tour groups.
Ryanair currently charges €8 (US$11.85) to use a credit card to book one round-trip flight, while a checked suitcase 
costs €12 (US$17.75) each way. The add-ons mean that, for example, tickets for two from Ireland to Norway could 
be booked Monday for just €0.04 (US$0.06) but the final price, with a lone checked suitcase, exceeds €150 
(US$225).

Ryanair Holdings PLC reported a flat third-quarter profit Monday and warned that its outlook for the peak summer

For the quarter ended Dec. 31, the no-frills airline said its net profit fell 1 percent to €47.2 million (US$69.9 million).

share price of €3.60 (US$5.33).

Leading European bourses look set for more gains in opening deals after a strong performance on Wall Street on 
Friday, with M&A hopes and earnings news likely to add some interest although the week's key focus will be 
interest rate decisions from the Bank of England and the ECB on Thursday.
In the US on Friday, the DJIA rose 92.83 points, to 12,743.19 after climbing more than 200 points Thursday as 
investors set aside anxiety over news that the economy lost jobs last month and focused on Microsoft Corp's bid for 
Internet company Yahoo Inc.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 16.87, or 1.22 pct, to 1,395.42, and the Nasdaq composite index advanced 
23.50, or 0.98 pct, to 2,413.36.
In Asia this morning, Japan's Nikkei 225 closed up 362.54 points or 2.7 pct at 13,859.70, while Hong Kong's Hang 
Seng was up 752.88 points or 3.1 pct at 24,876.46, by midday.
Another busy earnings week in Europe kicks off with numbers from Italcementi, Atlas Copco, Ryanair and Sage.
Elsewhere, car stocks will likely garner some interest with Daimlerchrysler taking centre stage after news late Friday 
that total car sales slumped 4.3 pct in January but Daimler's sales rose.
M&A hopes -- which lifted the FTSE back above the 6,000 point level on Friday -- look to spark more interest in the 
UK again today with TV group ITV in focus as three private equity groups are reportedly pondering a 3 bln stg bid 
for ITV, according to investment bankers.
Apax, Provident and KKR are 'running the numbers' and considering an opportunistic offer of about 100 pence a 
share, the Observer said.
The share price of the UK's biggest commercial broadcaster closed near an all-time low of 73 pence on Friday, 
which analysts say makes ITV vulnerable to a bid.
One of the countrys largest pub operators, Punch Taverns, has approached troubled rival Mitchells & Butlers, 
owner of the Harvester and All Bar One chains, about a merger that would create Britain's biggest pub group, 
weekend newspapers reported without citing sources.

biggest state-controlled banks, make secret approaches to buy Glencore's 14 bln stg stake in Xstrata, the London-

Shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC helped pull down the Nasdaq 100 index midday Monday after the no-frills airline 
said a potential recession and spiking oil costs may harm profit in coming periods.
The index, which includes 100 of the largest nonfinancial securities listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, fell 17.70 
points to 1,837.57 in midday trading. The broader Nasdaq composite fell 18.58 points to 2,394.78.
Shares of Ryanair fell $3, or 9 percent, to $30.22. The Irish company also said its fiscal third-quarter profit fell 1 
percent.
Shares of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. lost $2.15, or 5.2 percent, to $38.99. Besides concerns over oil, 
investors may be reacting to news from the Chicago-based company that it will begin charging most passengers for 
checking a second piece of luggage.
Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. shares fell $1.49, or 4.6 percent, to $30.89.
On the gaining side, shares of Baidu.com Inc. gained $12.40, or 4.6 percent, to $282. A Dinosaur Securities analyst 
speculated last week that the Chinese search engine may bid on Yahoo Inc., joining Microsoft Corp. which just 
entered its own bid.
Cadence Design Systems Inc. shares rose 36 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $10.97, bouncing back after plunging last 
week on fiscal first-quarter outlook that fell short of Wall Street's estimates.
And Yahoo Inc. shares advanced 94 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $29.67. The rise comes despite a downgrade from 
Soleil Securities to "Hold" from "Buy" mainly due to the stock's rapid jump past Soleil's $29 price target after 
Microsoft Inc. made an unsolicited buyout offer. Two Yahoo executives said in an e-mail filed with the Securities 
and Exchange commission that the company's board is considering the offer as "one of many options."

Low-fares airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said its third quarter profits fell by 27 pct and warned profits for next year 
could decline by as much as 50 pct.
The Dublin-based carrier saw its Q3 profit after tax fall to 35 mln eur from 48 mln eur last time. Ryanair's sales for 
the period increased 16 pct to 569 mln eur from 493 mln eur, while its adjusted basic EPS fell 24 pct to 2.35 eur 
cents from 3.09 eur cents.
The carrier said with oil prices at around 90 usd a barrel and fear of recession in the UK and many other European 
economies, the outlook for the coming fiscal year was poor. The airline said it is 'essentially unhedged' on fuel for 
next year, adding that high oil prices would impose significantly higher costs for the 2008/09 full year.
'At our most optimistic, a combination of flat yields and 75 usd oil would see profits grow by 6 pct to approximately 
500 mln eur, but at our most conservative, if forward oil prices remain at 85 usd, and consumer sentiment/sterling 
weakness leads to a 5 pct reduction in yields, then profits in the coming year could fall by as much as 50 pct to as 
low as 235 mln eur,' Ryanair said in a statement.
For the current year, however, the airline has maintained previous guidance of net profit growth of some 17.5 pct to 
roughly 470 mln eur.
The Irish airline said it carried 3.68 mln passengers last month -- 17 pct more than the 3.14 mln it carried in January 
2007.

Among the earnings stories for Monday, Feb. 4, from AP Financial News:
Top stories:
CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) Food processor Archer Daniels Midland Co. said Monday its fiscal second-quarter profit rose 
7 percent as higher earnings from oilseed processing and rising demand for feed grains offset declining margins in 
its ethanol business.
DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) Wendy's International Inc. said Monday that fourth-quarter earnings more than quadrupled from 
a year ago, when it took major charges for discontinued operations, as restaurants reported better margins in the 
face of high commodity prices.
Other stories:
NEW YORK (AP) Nam Tai Electronics Inc., a Hong Kong-based electronics manufacturing services provider, said 
Monday that although revenue fell, it swung to a fourth-quarter profit after last-year's quarter included a $14.5

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) Perfume and beauty products maker Parlux Fragrances Inc. on Monday reported 
lower fiscal third-quarter profit, after selling its Perry Ellis fragrance brand as part of a restructuring.

fourth-quarter earnings nearly doubled on strong sales across its core businesses.
NEW YORK (AP) OneBeacon Insurance Group Ltd. said Monday its fourth-quarter earnings fell 13 percent due to a 
decline in earned premiums and a charge tied to a special dividend.
DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC plummeted Monday after Europe's top no-frills airline 
reported flat third-quarter profits and warned of tough times ahead because of high fuel costs and fears of a

Is the U.S. economy slipping into recession? Economists, analysts, company executives and investors are 
increasingly recognizing the possibility.
Economists define a recession as two consecutive quarters of declining gross domestic product.
Following are some comments Monday assessing the state of the economy, and what may happen if the U.S. 
slides into a recession:
 UBS Investment Research analyst Eric Wasserstrom, citing the bank's forecast for a recession in the first half of 
this year, downgraded shares of three major credit card lenders to "Sell." He expects American Express Co., 
Capital One Financial Corp. and Discover Financial Services LLC to report more bad loans in their portfolios as a 
shrinking economy puts more people out of work.
 Economists at Citi Investment Research "now fear that the U.S. economy is teetering on the edge of recession." If 
true, analysts' expectations for corporate earnings are probably too optimistic by 30 percent, Citi said.
 Katherine Egbert, an analyst from Jefferies & Co., said the mortgage crisis spilling into other sectors "may be 
around the corner," though it has not yet happened.
If the traditional relationship between residential spending and equipment and software spending holds, Egbert 
expects to see evidence of a downturn during the first half of this year.
 Ryanair Holdings PLC, an Irish airline, warned higher oil prices and weaker demand could eat into the company's 
profit. The company said oil at $90 a barrel and fears of a recession in the U.K. and other European economies 
mean "the current outlook for the coming fiscal year is poor."

LONDON European stocks finished Monday's session mixed, losing earlier gains amid increasing fears a U.S. 
recession will eat into corporate earnings and activity across the globe.
Irish budget airline Ryanair painted a bleak picture when it issued a profit warning, citing higher oil prices, the weak 
British pound and weakening consumer confidence. Consumer-related stocks such as Danone and Unilever fell 
after euro-zone producer price index data showed accelerating food inflation.
Earlier in the session, merger and acquisition activity was in focus after the U.K.'s Punch Taverns said it made a 
takeover approach for struggling rival Mitchells & Butlers.
"Fundamentals are pointing toward an economic slowdown in Europe as a result of a U.S. slowdown and possible 
recession," said Christian Tegllund Blaabjerg, market strategist at Saxo Bank. "Today's M&A activity in Europe will 
most likely be short-lived," he added.
The Dow Jones Stoxx 600 Index gained 0.7 points, or 0.2 percent, to 329.13. Amongst national markets, the U.K.'s 
FTSE 100 Index lost 0.1 percent to 6026.20, while France's CAC-40 Index fell 0.1 percent to 4973.64. Germany's 
DAX Index added 0.5 percent to 7000.49.
Ryanair warned its profits could fall up to 50 percent in the next fiscal year due to high fuel costs and pressure on 
ticket prices from waning consumer demand. Shares fell 2.8 percent to €3.50. British Airways lost 1.9 percent to 
312 pence.
Food producers fell as food prices appear set to cause more pain for euro-zone consumers and policy makers 
following the release of December PPI data which indicated inflation is accelerating at its fastest rate in more than 
two decades. Groupe Danone closed 1.9 percent lower at €54.00 (US$80.08), Unilever down 1.4 percent at €22.00 
(US$32.62) and Nestle lost 2.3 percent to CHF484.5.
U.K. pub chain Punch Taverns unveiled terms in which both Punch and Mitchells & Butlers shareholders would own 
50 percent stakes in the shared company. The move would create the country's largest pub group. Punch Taverns 
closed down 6.5 percent, while Mitchells & Butlers finished up 3.6 percent.
European stocks mixed amid US recession fears
The mining sector experienced activity after Anglo American announced an agreement with China Development 
Bank to develop natural resource projects in China and Africa.
"We think the miners will continue to break out to new highs as the market becomes increasingly more confident 
that commodity prices can stay strong in this current economic slowdown," said Credit Suisse in a research note.
"The Chinese are also likely to bid up the values of our miners as control of resources becomes an ever important 
theme for the sector in 2008," bank said.
Anglo American closed up 1.2 percent, Vedanta Resources rose 3 percent, Antofagasta was up 1.4 percent and 
BHP Billiton closed 1.7 percent higher.
Friday, the mining sector surged after China's Chinalco and U.S.-based Alcoa announced the acquisition of a 12 
percent stake in Rio Tinto, thus complicating BHP Billiton's effort to take over its smaller rival. Rio Tinto closed 
Monday down 1.3 percent.
Elsewhere in Europe, Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali said it has rebuffed calls from Franklin Mutual Advisors, 
a unit of U.S. mutual funds group Franklin Templeton, for changes to its corporate governance. Shares closed 0.4 
percent higher at €28.50 (US$42.26).
Belgian-French bank Dexia moved to boost capital at its high-flying bond insurer FSA, as new business pours in 
following ratings downgrades at U.S. rivals Ambac and MBIA Inc. Shares gained 0.7 percent to €16.87 (US$25.02).

European stocks finished mixed in Monday's session, losing earlier gains amid increasing fears a U.S. recession 
will eat into corporate earnings and activity across the globe.
Irish budget airline Ryanair painted a bleak picture when it issued a profit warning, citing higher oil prices, the weak 
British pound and weakening consumer confidence. Consumer-related stocks such as Danone and Unilever fell 
after euro-zone producer price index data showed accelerating food inflation.
Earlier in the session, merger and acquisition activity was in focus after the U.K.'s Punch Taverns said it made a 
takeover approach for struggling rival Mitchells & Butlers.
"Fundamentals are pointing toward an economic slowdown in Europe as a result of a U.S. slowdown and possible 
recession," said Christian Tegllund Blaabjerg, market strategist at Saxo Bank. "Today's M&A activity in Europe will 
most likely be short-lived," he added.
The Dow Jones Stoxx 600 Index gained 0.7 points, or 0.2 percent, to 329.13. Among national markets, the U.K.'s 
FTSE 100 Index lost 0.1 percent to 6,026.20, while France's CAC-40 Index fell 0.1 percent to 4,973.64. Germany's 
DAX Index added 0.5 percent to 7,000.49.
Ryanair warned its profits could fall up to 50 percent in the next fiscal year because of high fuel costs and pressure 
on ticket prices from waning consumer demand. Shares fell 2.8 percent to €3.50. British Airways lost 1.9 percent to 
312 pence.
Food producers fell as food prices appear set to cause more pain for euro-zone consumers and policy makers 
following the release of December PPI data which indicated inflation is accelerating at its fastest rate in more than 
two decades. Groupe Danone closed 1.9 percent lower at €54.00 (US$80.08), Unilever down 1.4 percent at €22.00 
(US$32.62) and Nestle lost 2.3 percent to CHF484.5.
European stocks mixed amid U.S. recession fears
British pub chain Punch Taverns unveiled terms in which both Punch and Mitchells & Butlers shareholders would 
own 50 percent stakes in the shared company. The move would create the country's largest pub group. Punch 
Taverns closed down 6.5 percent, while Mitchells & Butlers finished up 3.6 percent.
The mining sector experienced activity after Anglo American announced an agreement with China Development 
Bank to develop natural resource projects in China and Africa.
"We think the miners will continue to break out to new highs as the market becomes increasingly more confident 
that commodity prices can stay strong in this current economic slowdown," Credit Suisse said in a research note.
"The Chinese are also likely to bid up the values of our miners as control of resources becomes an ever important 
theme for the sector in 2008," the bank said.
Anglo American closed up 1.2 percent, Vedanta Resources rose 3 percent, Antofagasta was up 1.4 percent and 
BHP Billiton closed 1.7 percent higher.
On Friday, the mining sector surged after China's Chinalco and U.S.-based Alcoa announced the acquisition of a 12 
percent stake in Rio Tinto, thus complicating BHP Billiton's effort to take over its smaller rival. Rio Tinto closed 
Monday down 1.3 percent.
Elsewhere in Europe, Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali said it has rebuffed calls from Franklin Mutual Advisors, 
a unit of U.S. mutual funds group Franklin Templeton, for changes to its corporate governance. Shares closed 0.4 
percent higher at €28.50 (US$42.26).
Belgian-French bank Dexia moved to boost capital at its high-flying bond insurer FSA, as new business pours in 
following ratings downgrades at U.S. rivals Ambac and MBIA Inc. Shares gained 0.7 percent to €16.87 (US$25.02).

Leading European shares remained higher midday as Wall Street is seen adding to gains with a raft of takeover

4 pct last week.
In the European financial sector, Deutsche Boerse was up 2.2 pct as dealers pointed to increased trade levels in 
January, which stymied fears of a possible slowdown in turnover at the German Stock market operator.
And shares in Northern Rock stormed 8.85 pct higher as the deadline for a decision on the bank's fate approached. 
The beleaguered UK mortgage lender is expected to attract a total of three rescue proposals by today's 
government-imposed deadline.
Proposals are expected from Olivant Advisers, the buyout firm led by former Abbey chief Luqman Arnold; a 
consortium fronted by Virgin Group; and an in-house team led by Paul Thompson, the former chief executive of 
insurer Resolution who was appointed to the Rock's board last month.
Royal Bank of Scotland climbed 6.43 pct after the group sought to reassure investors. The banking group told the 
Sunday Telegraph it would consider offloading part of its minority stake in Bank of China if a deepening crisis in the 
banking system required it to raise fresh capital.
But Societe Generale was left out in the cold, pulling back some of last week's M&A fuelled gains, as a number of 
brokers have tried to dampen speculation, suggesting a deal is no way certain. Shares fell back 2.51 pct.
Banco Santander slipped back 0.41 pct after UBS cut its rating to 'neutral' from 'buy'.
And shares in Ryanair Holdings fell 11.53 pct -- their lowest level in over two and a half years -- after the low-cost 
airline posted a 27 pct fall in third quarter profits and warned earnings for 2008-09 could decline by as much as 50 
pct due to higher oil prices.
Euroshares higher midday as Wall St seen adding to gains; M&A hopes add interest
Peer Easyjet may be facing similar fuel pressures sending the company's shares down 5.1 pct.
Elsewhere among transport groups, Daimler shares were up 2.5 pct after the car maker said US sales of its 
Mercedes-Benz brand rose 7.1 pct in January -- far outstripping the performance of other car makers. Broker 
WestLB also upgraded the company to 'buy' from 'add.'
Peugeot stormed 3.89 pct higher as SG Secs said the French car maker is its preferred sector pick. The broker 
repeated its 'buy' saying the group's lack of exposure to the US gives it a defensive profile.
Back in M&A, Saint-Gobain shares added 2.19 pct as French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanchereported Wendel 
--- the building materials groups' largest shareholder -- is planning to take advantage of Saint-Gobain's current low 
share price to raise its capital stake in the company.
And Rio Tinto slipped back 0.59 pct amid reports the Chinese government is preparing to launch an unprecedented 
legal challenge against BHP Billiton's planned 130 bln usd takeover bid for its rival.
The report comes just a few day after aluminium companies Chinalco and Alcoa bought a 12 pct stake in Rio Tinto, 
a move which was viewed by some as a spoiler to BHP Billiton's bid. Shares in BHP Billiton added 1.05 pct.
Elsewhere in the mining sector, prospective buyers from Asia, Europe and South America, including one of China's 
biggest state-controlled banks, have made secret approaches to buy Glencore's 14 bln stg stake in Xstrata, the 
London-listed mining group.
Shares in Xstrata fell 1.85 pct after reports Brazilian mining group Cia Vale do Rio Doce fired Merrill Lynch as co-
lead adviser after the investment bank decided not to help finance a potential 90 bln usd takeover bid for the Anglo-
Swiss group.
Merrill was told by Vale that it would lose its advisory role in the takeover if it did not commit a large part of its 
balance sheet to finance the transaction, people close to the situation told the Finacial Times.
However, the bank concluded that the terms of the financing were not economically feasible for either its own or 
Vale's shareholders.
Elsewhere in the UK, shares in ITV rose 3.14 pct after the Observer newspaper said three private equity groups are 
pondering a 3 bln stg bid for ITV, citing investment bankers.
Bear Stearns upgraded its stance on the UK TV group to 'peer perform' from 'underperform'.

STOCKS: Wall Street capped a week of big gains with another sizeable advance Friday after investors set aside 
anxiety over news that the economy lost jobs last month and focused on Microsoft Corp's bid for internet company 
Yahoo Inc and a possible rescue plan for the troubled bond insurance sector.
The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 index each rose more than 4 pct for the week, 
their steepest gains since March 2003.
Stocks fluctuated at times Friday, however, as investors weighed seemingly contradictory readings on the 
economy.
The Labour Department's employment report for January said the economy lost 17,000 jobs, marking the first 
contraction of the labour market in more than four years. The unemployment rate fell to 4.9 pct from 5 pct in 
December, though the move came as the labour pool shrank.

The Commerce Department reported that construction spending dropped 1.1 pct in December -- the most in 15 
months and twice what analysts expected.
Also, rating agency Moody's Investors Service warned on a conference call Friday that it expects to downgrade 
some bond insurers this month.
Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management, a business group, said its index of manufacturing activity rose to 
50.7 from 48.4 in December. Wall Street had expected the figure would come in at 47, a reading that would indicate 
a contraction of the manufacturing sector.
FOREX: The dollar rose Friday against the euro and the British pound, helped by rising stock prices and a modest 
expansion in the US manufacturing sector despite a weak report on jobs.
The dollar rose to 1.4803 usd per euro from 1.4877 usd Thursday. The dollar jumped to 1.9677 usd per British 
pound from 1.9900 usd. The dollar also inched up to 106.47 yen from 106.43 yen.
The dollar fell to 99.38 Canadian cents from 1.0040 cad.
BONDS: Bond prices slipped in late trading. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.60 pct 
from 3.59 pct Thursday.
OIL: In energy markets, oil prices fell below 90 usd a barrel after the US government reported weak jobs data for 
January, fuelling concerns that a recession may undercut energy demand.
March heating oil futures lost 8.02 cents to 2.4489 usd a gallon, while March gasoline futures dropped 7.38 cents to 
2.2834 usd a gallon.
METALS: Gold futures fell sharply Friday after the dollar strengthened and investors cashed in profits following the 
metal's big January gain.
Other precious metals traded mixed, with silver easing off a 28-year high and platinum hitting a record for a second 
straight session.
After a sharp overnight rise, gold for April delivery fell 14.50 usd to 913.50 usd an ounce on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange.
Meanwhile, platinum prices continued their upward climb amid power disruptions in South Africa, the world's 
leading platinum producer and second largest gold producer.
March silver rose to 17.345 usd an ounce -- its highest level since 1980 -- before settling at 16.870 usd, down 12.5 
cents. March copper lost 2.5 cents to 3.2730 usd a pound.

STOCKS: Asian markets began the week with strong gains as Wall Street's advance Friday fuelled buying of 
battered stocks although many are worried the upturn could be short-lived due to concerns about the health of the 
US economy.

after share
prices rebounded sharply following a rally on Wall Street.
FOREX: The US dollar was higher against most major currencies midway through the session in Sydney after rising 
stock
prices and a modest expansion in the US manufacturing sector helped the greenback advance against the euro and

OIL: World oil traded flat in Asia after concerns for the US economy appeared to outweigh the impact of OPEC's 
decision to hold output steady.
In morning trade, New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in March, was 3 cents lower at 88.93 usd

STOCKS: London shares closed firmer Friday as Wall Street recovered from lows, with the mining sector among 
the major gainers following news that two companies had acquired a stake in Rio Tinto.
Leading European shares ended higher Friday, wrapping a solid week of gains for the major STOXX indices, as 
investors on both sides of the Atlantic welcomed the US Federal Reserve's decision last Wednesday to cut interest 
rates once again in a bid to avert a US recession.
BONDS: European government bonds tracked Treasuries higher after a mixed US economic data supported the 
overall view that interest rates are set to fall further in the US. In the UK, gilts were higher after data showed very 
weak growth in the manufacturing sector at the same time as record-high price pressures.
FOREX: The dollar ended the week on a fairly solid tone, particularly against the euro and the pound, despite a 
surprise fall in US employment numbers in January.
OIL: Oil dropped by almost 2 usd on heightened recession fears after US job figures dropped for the first time since 
2003. A slowing US economy has dented the crude demand outlook.
METALS: Gold and platinum hit fresh all time highs Friday, while silver and palladium were at multi-year peaks, as 
a soft dollar, South African mining disruptions and a slowing US economy saw money pour into the complex.
Base metals came off day highs, with most turning lower after much weaker than expected US payrolls data 
reinforced fears the world's largest economy is heading into recession.

Highlight: Shares at no-frills airline Ryanair fell over 13 percent today
Body
Shares at no-frills airline Ryanair fell over 13 percent today after its third-quarter profits fell by 27pc and warned 
profits for next year could decline by as much as 50pc.
At 2.10pm, shares at the airline were down 48c to 3.12. 
The carrier saw its Q3 profit after tax fall to E35 million from E48 million last time distorted by a one-off E10 million 
contract termination penalty received from a previous hotel partner, it said, adding that underlying profit decline was 
roughly 10 pct.
 The carrier's yields fell 4 pct but sales for the period increased 16 pct to E569 million from E493 million. Its 
adjusted basic EPS fell 24 pct to E2.35 cents from E3.09 cents, meanwhile. Europe's largest low-fares airline said 
with oil prices hovering around the USD90 /barrel mark and fear of recession across European economies, the 
outlook for the coming fiscal year was poor. The airline said it is 'essentially unhedged' on fuel for next year, adding 
that high oil prices would impose significantly higher costs for the 2008/09 full year. 'At our most optimistic, a 
combination of flat yields and USD75 oil would see profits grow by 6 pct to approximately E500 million, but at our 
most conservative, if forward oil prices remain at USD85, and consumer sentiment/sterling weakness leads to a 5 
pct reduction in yields, then profits in the coming year could fall by as much as 50 pct to as low as E235 million,' 
Ryanair said in a statement. Douglas McNeill, a transport analyst at Blue Oar Securities said Ryanair 'seldom 
misses a chance to depress expectations' and would likely cuts fares going ahead 'to stimulate demand and 
squeeze weaker competitors'. Earnings will likely be hit by the recent weakness of Sterling, the airline said, 
although it maintained its previous guidance of net profit growth of some 17.5 pct to roughly E470 million. Unit costs 
-- excluding fuel hedges -- rose by 6 pct in the quarter due primarily to a doubling of airport charges at Stansted, 
significant cost increases at Dublin Airport combined with longer sector lengths, offset in part by lower cost fuel 
hedges. Costs were positively impacted by the reduction of winter capacity at Stansted but staff costs rose by 18 
pct to E67 million. Some analysts believe the company's plans to hike capacity and fly further could -- along with all 
Ryanair shares tumble on profit warning
the other issues -- negatively affect the airline next year. 'It also has a 20 pct uplift in capacity and a cost hike of 
approximately 5 pct stemming from an increase in sector lengths to absorb next year. At the same time, 
management notes that consumer confidence is waning which may hit yield growth or may result in a fall in yields,' 
said Peter Caldwell, an equity analyst at Barclays Wealth. Although concerned about a potentially volatile year 
ahead, Ryanair believes it can deal with the turmoil better than its competitors due to its strong balance sheet and 
ability to attract customers looking for a bargain. 'Low cost airlines are relatively resilient in a recession, as proven 
by Southwest in the US, due to travellers trading down, weaker competitors down-sizing and even going bankrupt 
and the likelihood of weaker oil prices in recessionary times,' Citigroup analysts wrote in a research note on the 
airline. The UK government's decision to reject plans by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to de-designate the 
Stansted Airport monopoly was welcomed by Ryanair, but the airline said it would continue to campaign for the 
break up of 'the BAA Airport monopoly in London'. The carrier's new bases at Alicante and Valencia in Spain, 
Belfast City in Northern Ireland, and Bristol in the UK performed well during their first winter. As such, the company 
expects to invest significantly in new aircraft, new routes and new jobs over the summer of 2008 and will likely 
announce at least two further European bases shortly, both of which will launch this winter. Another new initiative 
will see in-flight mobile phone services tested on 25 aircraft a- subject to regulatory approval -- during the April-June 
quarter, said the carrier. The Irish airline carried 3.68 million passengers last month -- 17 pct more than the 3.14 
million it carried in January 2007. Separately, the airline said its directors have confirmed plans to undertake a 
second buyback programme of up to E200 million. At the current market price of E3.60 per share this equates to a 
buyback of some 3 pct of the company's issued share capital, it added. At 12.15pm shares in Ryanair were trading 
E0.44 cents or 12.15 pct lower at 3.18 eur. Copyright: Thomson Financial

Highlight: Ryanair this morning reported a massive 27pc slump in third quarter profit, warned over full year.
Body
Ryanair this morning reported a massive 27pc slump in third quarter profit and warned that profits could halve on 
rising oil prices and weak currency markets.
The no-frills airline posted a pre-tax profits of E50.48m for the three months to the end of December, compared to 
E51.sm in the same period in 2006 and net profits that declined 27pc to E35m, excluding a one-off gain from the 
sale of aircraft.
Ryanair stuck to its full-year forecast for a 17.5pc rise in the year to the end of March. It warned, however, there 
was a "significant chance" profits would fall in its 2008/2009 business year.
 "The European airline sector is presently facing one of these cyclical downturns, with possibility of a "perfect storm" 
of higher oil prices, poor consumer demand, weaker sterling and higher costs," the airline said in a statement. 
According to the most optimistic scenario, profit next year could grow 6pc to E500m if average ticket prices, or 
yields, stay flat and oil prices drop to USD75 a barrel. "But at our most conservative, if forward oil prices remain at 
USD85, and consumer sentiment/sterling weakness leads to a 5pc reduction in yields, then profits in the coming 
year could fall by as much as 50pc to as low as E235m (excluding profits from aircraft disposals)," it said. The 
company also said it planned to spend up to E200m buying back shares which, based on its current share price, 
would equate to 3pc of Ryanair's total share capital at the current market price of E3.60 a share. "Despite the 
possibility of a fall in profits next year, our airline continues to deliver the industry's highest margins and will remain 
enormously cash generative, with a very strong balance sheet. We continue to have over E2bn in cash despite 
spending over E700m in the last twelve months acquiring a 29pc stake in Aer Lingus and completing a share 
buyback of E300m," the airline added.

Body
The Dublin market closed in positive territory today on news that the exchange has outperformed hugely year to 
date.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed up 69.22 points at 6909.14
The Irish market is to continue to outperform as housing and interest rate outlook improves, Davy Research said. 
The ISEQ is the second-best performing EU-27 market in 2008 after Slovakia, it said in its weekly market comment. 
It is down only 1.4pc for the year versus a loss of 10.1pc for the FTSE Eurofirst300. "We expect this to continue as 
housing and interest rate news becomes increasingly positive," it said. It said that there are two key reasons why 
sentiment towards the Irish stock market has improved. 
First, housing newsflow is getting better rather than worse. Second, the Irish economy will be the chief beneficiary if 
interest rates fall in the euro area this year. Banks drove the index higher. Bank of Ireland was down 4c at 10.16 
and AIB slipped 20c to 15.11. Anglo Irish Bank climbed 15c to 10.05. For the Irish market, there are two important 
central bank meetings this week. On Thursday, the Bank of England will announce a repo rate cut to 5.25pc from

bucking the trend of declines of 1pc for the ISEQ and 11pc for European and UK General Insurers. This increase is 
probably a reversal of the shares underperformance last year, where it suffered as heavily as the banks in the 
"credit crunch", notwithstanding somewhat different dynamics. "We are increasing our 12 month fair value for FBD 
by 9pc to E31.80 as we roll over our valuation to 2009. However, as this price target only provides 12pc upside from 
the current price, we are pulling back our recommendation from Buy to Add. "However, we remain positive on the 
fundamentals for FBD and believe there is further potential for enhancement to the value of the company as further 
excess claims reserves are released and reinvested and claims reserving policy is revised to reflect more recent 
experience," Anna Lalor, analyst at Goodbody Research said.

* News Corp , the media conglomerate controlled by Rupert Murdoch, reports second quarter earnings - its first 
results since it closed its Dollars 5bn acquisition of Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal in December, writes 
Joshua Chaffin .
Wall Street is expecting 28 cents per share, up from 26 cents for the same period last year, driven by double- digit 
revenue gains in its cable networks business.
Investors will be looking for any signs of the impact of a slowing US economy - particularly on advertising - and the 
effects of a prolonged Hollywood writers' strike.
Although the Journal represents a relatively small part of News Corp's portfolio, investors will also be eager for 
more details about the paper's future. Mr Murdoch recently appeared to reverse a plan to drop the subscription fee 
for the WSJ.com website.
Meanwhile, the Journal is preparing to add a sports page to compete with the New York Times and to move its 
headquarters to News Corp's Midtown headquarters - all the closer to new siblings like the Fox Business Network.

* With nine-month and third quarterly fiscal year results, Toyota , the world's most profitable big carmaker, is 
expected to report solidly stronger earnings on the back of record group global vehicle sales of 9.37m last year and 
strong positions on all of its main overseas markets, writes John Reed .
Toyota's earnings will also be helped by its strong line-up of fuel-efficient vehicles amid rising petrol prices.
The company does face some headwinds, including slower - if still growing - sales in the US, where it sells more 
than a quarter of its vehicles, and the strengthening of the yen against the dollar last year.
Corporate Diary
It trails some of its competitors, including GM, in fast-growing emerging markets such as Russia, China and India, a 
factor that allowed the US carmaker to keep its century-old title as the world's top-selling carmaker last year.
* CME Group is due to announce its fourth quarter earnings before US markets open, writes Hal Weitzman . 
Analysts expect earnings per share to rise to about Dollars 3.61 for the quarter, up from Dollars 2.91 per share in 
the same quarter of 2006.
CME - the product of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's takeover of the Chicago Board of Trade last year - last 
week announced it was in exclusive talks to buy Nymex, the energy exchange for about Dollars 11.3bn in cash and 
shares.
The takeover would solidify CME's position as the world's most important futures market, giving it control over about 
98 per cent of US listed futures. CME's volumes have been boosted by both the secular growth in derivatives 
trading and recent stock market turbulence, as investors look to manage risk or bet on further volatility.
* NYSE Euronext will report its first quarterly earnings under recently appointed chief executive Duncan Niederauer, 
writes Anuj Gangahar . Having already revealed his intention to follow predecessor John Thain down the path to 
acquisitions by buying the American Stock Exchange last month, Mr Niederauer will be hoping analysts predicting a 
sharp rise in fourth quarter profits are proved right.
Analysts are forecasting fourth quarter earnings of Dollars 0.66 per share, up from Dollars 0.45 a year ago.
Quarterly revenues are predicted to be Dollars 946m, up from the better than expected Dollars 478m a year ago. 
The exchange group also reports full-year figures for 2007.
The transatlantic exchange last week expanded its presence in Japan and Singapore and continues the stiff task of 
integrating the NYSE and Euronext businesses and cultures.
Its success in the US is likely to depend increasingly on how well it competes in the options business.
The Amex acquisition will go some way to seeing that it is more likely to fare well in this area under Mr Niederauer 
than at any time under Mr Thain.
NYSE Euronext shares have fallen below the Dollars 80 mark having been above Dollars 90 as recently as 
December, but have risen recently as the market welcomed the Amex deal.

* Deutsche Bank is among the small handful of global investment banking groups that have escaped posting 
gargantuan losses on subprime mortgage securities, and its full-year results should provide more detail on precisely 
how it fared in the turbulent fourth quarter of 2007, writes Chris Hughes .
Josef Ackermann, chief executive, has spoken out on behalf of investment banks industry during the credit crunch, 
most recently calling for products to be more transparent. His latest comments will be keenly heard.
Corporate Diary
But the relative resilience of Deutsche Bank's share price during the crunch - it has fallen only 8 per cent in the past 
six months - may have made it harder to drive it higher from here.
Analysts at Credit Suisse recently recommended clients switch into UBS, noting Deutsche bank's smaller wealth 
management operation and warning that the German bank's more diversified fixed-income operations could come 
under pressure if problems spread elsewhere from structured finance and mortgage backed securities.
* Jean-Pierre Garnier, GlaxoSmithKline 's outgoing chief executive, will share a stage with his successor Andrew 
Witty today to announce full-year results amid concern the company will face a tougher time in 2008, writes Andrew 
Jack .
Consensus forecasts suggest pretax profits of Pounds 7.6bn on sales of Pounds 22.5bn, giving earnings per share 
of 96.8p in a year marked by pressure including a sharp drop in prescriptions for its diabetes medicine Avandia on 
safety concerns.
But investors will be keen to gain any insights into Mr Witty's new strategy and GSK's growth prospects this year 
against a backdrop of rising generic competition.

* Ryanair reports its third quarter earnings with most of its profits already in the bag from the first half, seasonally 
the most important months of the year, writes Kevin Done .
The big increase in profits in the first half was achieved in spite of higher oil prices and a doubling of airport charges 
at London Stansted, the airline's biggest operating base in Europe.
Growing worries in recent months about the worsening economic outlook have caused a big fall in airline share 
prices, however, as investors have become nervous about the outlook for the airline sector. Rival EasyJet suffered 
a sharp fall in its share price recently in response to weaker traffic figures than expected in spite of the fact that it 
left its profit forecast unchanged.
At the end of the half year, Ryanair revised its forecast for full-year profits upwards, advising of an increase of 17.5 
per cent to Euros 470m up from the previous guidance of Euros 440m.
* As a supplier of chips for the Apple iPod, Wolfson Microelectronics has done particularly well out of the craze for 
digital music players, writes Philip Stafford . It has also benefited from surging demand for satnav car systems. Full-
year figures are likely to reflect those trends. Wolfson has already told the market it expects fourth quarter revenues 
to be in the range of Dollars 66m-Dollars 72m and full-year turnover to be about Dollars 226m-Dollars 232m, giving 
an annual growth rate of 11 per cent to 14 per cent.

*At British Sky Broadcasting 's interim results, Jeremy Darroch, its new chief executive, will be under pressure to 
demonstrate that momentum has not stalled, writes Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson .
Dresdner Kleinwort estimates that demand fell sharply in the Christmas period, predicting gross and net additions to 
its subscriber base of 400,000 and 170,000, respectively, down 7 per cent from a year earlier.
Citigroup is more bullish, expecting 417,000 gross adds or 188,000 net, but all eyes will be on second quarter 
margins and guidance about the second half, where Dresdner expects 130,000 net adds.

* Rolls-Royce , the aero-engine maker, will announce the outcome of a financial strategic review alongside its 
results for the full year, writes Sylvia Pfeifer .
Analysts expect the company to announce it is returning cash to shareholders as it continues to reap the benefits of 
a record order backlog of Pounds 45bn. They estimate Rolls could return about Pounds 500m to shareholders via a 
share buy-back.
Analyst consensus forecasts for underlying pretax profits for the full year are Pounds 800m, up 13.5 per cent year-
on-year. Earnings per share are forecast to be 32.5p, up from 29.81p.
Observers will also be watching for further details on the recent news that it is shedding 2,300 jobs worldwide to 
help offset the weak dollar and rising raw material prices.
* Jean-Pierre Garnier, GlaxoSmithKline 's outgoing chief executive, will share a stage with his successor Andrew 
Witty today to announce full-year results amid concern the company will face a tougher time in 2008, writes Andrew

But investors will be keen to gain any insights into Mr Witty's new strategy and growth prospects during this year 
against a backdrop of rising generic competition. In a research note, Cazenove anticipated a repeat of GSK's 
pattern of conservative earnings guidance at the start of the year, raising it later.

Among the earnings stories for Monday, Feb. 4, from AP Financial News:
DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC plummeted Monday after Europe's top no-frills airline 
reported flat third-quarter profits and warned of tough times ahead because of high fuel costs and fears of a 
recession.
LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) Health insurer Humana Inc. said profits surged 57 percent in the fourth-quarter thanks to its 
growing Medicare Advantage business, a lower-than-expected income tax rate and the sale of a venture capital 
investment.
CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) Food processor Archer Daniels Midland Co. said Monday its second-quarter profit rose 7 
percent as higher earnings from oilseed processing and rising demand for feed grains offset declining margins in its 
ethanol business.
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) Wendy's International Inc. said Monday that fourth-quarter earnings more than quadrupled 
from a year ago, when it took major charges for discontinued operations, and restaurants reported better margins 
despite high commodity prices.
