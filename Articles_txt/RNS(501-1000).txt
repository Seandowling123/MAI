   Ryanair Holdings plc
   ("Ryanair" or the "Company" or the "Group")
   Result of Placing
   Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, today announces the successful pricing of the non-pre-emptive placing of new 
ordinary shares of EUR0.006 each in the capital of the Company (the "Ordinary Shares") to institutional investors 
and certain others (the "Placing") following yesterday's announcement.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Result of Placing
   A total of 35,242,291 new Ordinary Shares in the Company (the "Placing Shares") have been placed by J&E 
Davy ("Davy") at a price of EUR11.35 per Placing Share (the "Placing Price"), raising gross proceeds of 
approximately EUR400 million. Davy is acting as sole bookrunner in respect of the Placing.
   The Placing Shares represent approximately 3.2% of the Company's issued share capital immediately prior to the 
Placing. The Placing Price represents a discount of approximately 2.6% to the closing price on 3 September 2020.
   The Placing Shares, when issued, will be fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with each other and 
with the existing Ordinary Shares, including, without limitation, the right to receive all dividends and other 
distributions declared, made or paid in respect of Ordinary Shares after the date of issue.
   Ryanair consulted with a number of its major shareholders prior to the Placing and has endeavoured to respect 
the principles of pre-emption through the allocation process insofar as possible. The Company is pleased by the 
strong support it has received from new and existing shareholders.
   Applications have been made for admission of the Placing Shares to (a) a primary listing on the Official List of The 
Irish Stock Exchange plc, trading as Euronext Dublin ("Euronext Dublin") and to trading on the Euronext Dublin 
Market operated by Euronext Dublin (together, the "Irish Admission"); and (b) the standard listing segment of the 
Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom (the "FCA") and to trading on the London 
Stock Exchange plc's (the "London Stock Exchange") main market for listed securities (together, the "UK 
Admission" and, together with the Irish Admission, "Admission").
   It is expected that settlement of the Placing Shares will occur, Admission will become effective and that dealings 
will commence in the Placing Shares at 8.00 a.m. on 8 September 2020. The Placing is conditional upon, amongst 
other things, Admission becoming effective and the Placing Agreement not being terminated in accordance with its 
terms.
   Following Admission, the total number of shares in issue in the Company will be 1,125,292,028. The Company 
does not hold any Ordinary Shares as treasury shares. Therefore, following Admission, the total number of voting 
shares in Ryanair in issue will be 1,125,292,028. This figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for 
the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their 
interest in the Company under the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 of Ireland and the 
Central Bank (Investment Market Conduct) Rules 2019 of Ireland.
   This announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of MAR. For the purposes of MAR 
and Article 2 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1055, this announcement is being made on behalf

   Ryanair Holdings plc
   ("Ryanair", the "Company" or the "Group")
   Proposed Placing of New Ordinary Shares
   Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, today announces its intention to conduct an equity raise, through a 
non-pre-emptive placing of new ordinary shares of EUR0.006 each in the capital of the Company (the 
"Placing Shares") to institutional investors and certain others, to raise gross proceeds of approximately 
EUR400 million (the "Placing").
   The Placing will be conducted through an accelerated bookbuild (the "Bookbuild") which will be launched 
immediately following this Announcement and will be made available to qualifying new and existing eligible 
institutional investors. The Placing is subject to the terms and conditions set out in Appendix 1 to this 
announcement. J&E Davy ("Davy") is acting as sole bookrunner in respect of the Placing.
   Reasons for the Placing
   So far, 2020 has proven to be the most challenging period in Ryanair's 35-year history and an 
unprecedented difficult environment for the wider European airline sector. The Group believes that it has 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Proposed Placing of New Ordinary Shares
responded well and that the current environment is likely to result in long-term impacts for the sector 
which it expects will create opportunities for Ryanair to grow its network, and expand its fleet, to take 
advantage of lower airport and aircraft cost opportunities that are likely to arise. The Placing is 
expected to help better position the Group to move quickly to capitalise on such opportunities should they 
arise. Additionally, the Placing should significantly de-risk the Group's debt repayments over the next 12 
months.
    1.   Capitalise on significant post Covid-19 growth opportunities
   One of the strengths of Ryanair's business model during the Covid-19 crisis has been the Group's unit 
cost advantage over other EU airlines. Ryanair has spent a number of months right sizing the cost base to 
help enable the Group's airlines to further lower costs and pass these lower costs on to customers in the 
form of lower fares. As we look beyond the next year, we expect that there will be significant growth 
opportunities for Ryanair's low-cost model as competitors shrink, fail or are acquired by government 
bailed out carriers.
   Post Covid-19 growth opportunities include gaining market share from peers retrenching, further 
European airline failures and competitive unit cost advantage over other carriers. The Placing will 
provide Ryanair with greater financial flexibility to capture these opportunities.
    2.   Strengthen Ryanair's robust financial position
   Ryanair's balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry with over EUR3.9 billion in cash at 30 
June 2020, with 333 unencumbered B737s (with a book value of approx. EUR7 billion) and a BBB investment 
grade rating from both S&P and Fitch Ratings. Since mid-March, the Group has moved quickly and smartly to 
preserve cash, cut costs, cancel share buybacks and defer all non-essential capex, ensuring continued 
balance sheet strength which gives the Group what it believes to be a significant competitive advantage. 
The net proceeds from the Placing are intended to further enhance Ryanair's liquidity position and 
underpin its BBB investment grade rating potentially leading to finance cost savings. Subject to market 
conditions, the Group expects to access the bond markets in due course and the enhanced liquidity as a 
result of the Placing will likely optimise that issuance.
    3.   Prudent Capital Management
   Over the medium-term Ryanair will continue to focus on cash preservation/generation and the repayment 
of approx. EUR1.9 billion of maturing debt which includes a EUR850 million Eurobond and GBP600 million 
raised under the UK's Covid Corporate Financing Facility ("CCFF") maturing in June and March 2021 
respectively.
   The Group hopes to accept delivery of its first Boeing-MAX-200, and potentially up to 40 MAXs in 
advance of summer 2021. Ryanair remains a committed supporter of these "gamechanger" aircraft which have 
4% more seats, 16% lower fuel burn and 40% lower noise emissions than its existing B737NGs. These new 
aircraft will enable the Group to grow to 200m passengers p.a. over the next 5 or 6 years while reducing 
the Group's cost base and significantly lowering its environmental footprint.
   Prudent capital management through the Placing and the expected bond issuance will pre-fund the Group's 
balance sheet and enhance its financial flexibility as it continues to face a very challenging and 
uncertain operational environment.
   Director and Senior Management participation
   Certain Directors and members of the senior management team intend to participate in the Placing 
including the Group CEO, who intends to subscribe broadly pro rata to his current shareholding.
   Details of the Placing
   Davy is acting as sole bookrunner in relation to the Placing. The Company and Davy have entered into a 
placing agreement dated 3 September 2020 in connection with the Placing (the "Placing Agreement").
   The final number of Placing Shares and the price at which such shares will be subscribed for will be 
determined at the close of the Bookbuild, and the result will be announced as soon as practicable 
thereafter. The timing for the close of the Bookbuild, the allocation of the Placing Shares and the 
Placing Price shall be determined together by, and at the absolute discretion of, Davy and the Company. 
The Placing is not underwritten.
   The Placing Shares, when issued, will be fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with each 
other and with the existing ordinary shares of EUR0.006 each in the capital of the Company (the "Ordinary 
Shares"), including, without limitation, the right to receive all dividends and other distributions 
declared, made or paid in respect of Ordinary Shares after the date of issue.
   Applications will be made for admission of the Placing Shares to (a) a primary listing on the Official 
List of The Irish Stock Exchange plc, trading as Euronext Dublin ("Euronext Dublin") and to trading on the 
Euronext Dublin Market operated by Euronext Dublin (together, the "Irish Admission"); and (b) the standard 
listing segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom (the "FCA") 
and to trading on the London Stock Exchange plc's (the "London Stock Exchange") main market for listed 
securities (together, the "UK Admission" and, together with the Irish Admission, "Admission").
   It is expected that settlement of the Placing Shares will occur, Admission will become effective and 
that dealings will commence in the Placing Shares at 8.00 a.m. on 8 September 2020. The Placing is 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Proposed Placing of New Ordinary Shares
conditional upon, amongst other things, Admission becoming effective and the Placing Agreement not being 
terminated in accordance with its terms. Appendix 1 to this Announcement, which forms part of this 
Announcement, sets out further information relating to the Bookbuild and the Terms and Conditions to which 
the Placing is subject.
   By choosing to participate in the Placing and by making an oral and legally binding offer to acquire 
Placing Shares, investors will be deemed to have read and understood this Announcement in its entirety 
(including the Appendices) and to be making such offer on the terms and subject to the conditions in it, 
and to be providing the representations, warranties, indemnities, acknowledgements and undertakings 
contained in Appendix 1.
   The Directors of the Company have determined that the Placing Shares may be subscribed for by both EU 
Nationals (as defined in Appendix 2) and non-EU Nationals as part of the Placing.
   The restrictions announced by the Company in February 2002 will continue to apply to all other Ordinary 
Shares such that the acquisition of Ordinary Shares by non-EU Nationals will result in the issuance of a 
restricted share notice compelling the non-EU National to sell the relevant Ordinary Shares to an EU 
National within 21 days of the date of issuance (a "Restricted Share Notice"). These restrictions will 
also apply to the transfer/sale of any Placing Shares by a Placee to a non-EU National after the 
settlement of the Placing Shares whereby such transfer/sale will immediately result in the issuance of a 
Restricted Share Notice to the transferee/purchaser. As a result, non-EU Nationals are effectively 
prohibited from purchasing Ordinary Shares (including any Placing Shares from any of the Placees) for as 
long as these restrictions remain in place. There can be no assurance that these restrictions will ever be 
amended/removed.

 Announcement or any other offering or publicity material relating to such shares in any jurisdiction where action for 
that purpose is required. Persons into whose possession this Announcement comes are required by the Company 
and Davy to inform themselves about, and to observe, such restrictions. Any failure to comply with these restrictions 
may constitute a violation of the securities laws of such jurisdictions.
   The information in this Announcement may not be forwarded or distributed to any other person and may not be 
reproduced in any manner whatsoever. Any forwarding, distribution, reproduction, or disclosure of this information 
in whole or in part is unauthorised. Failure to comply with this directive may result in a violation of the Securities Act 
or the applicable laws of other jurisdictions.
   This Announcement does not identify or suggest, or purport to identify or suggest, the risks (direct or indirect) that 
may be associated with an investment in the Placing Shares. Any investment decision to buy Placing Shares in the 
Placing must be made solely on the basis of publicly available information, which has not been independently 
verified by Davy. The contents of this Announcement are not to be construed as legal, financial or tax advice. 
Persons needing advice should consult an independent financial adviser.
   Solely for the purposes of the product governance requirements contained within: (a) EU Directive 2014/65/EU on 
markets in financial instruments, as amended ("MiFID II"); (b) Articles 9 and 10 of Commission Delegated Directive 
(EU) 2017/593 supplementing MiFID II; and (c) local implementing measures (together, the "MiFID II Product 
Governance Requirements"), and disclaiming all and any liability, whether arising in tort, contract or otherwise, 
which any 'manufacturer' (for the purposes of the MiFID II Product Governance Requirements) may otherwise have 
with respect thereto, the Placing Shares have been subject to a product approval process, which has determined 
that such Placing Shares are: (i) compatible with an end target market of retail investors and investors who meet 
the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) eligible for 
distribution through all distribution channels as are permitted by MiFID II (the "Target Market Assessment"). 
Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, distributors should note that: the price of the Placing Shares may 
decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the Placing Shares offer no guaranteed income and 
no capital protection; and an investment in the Placing Shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a 
guaranteed income or capital protection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Proposed Placing of New -3-
adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to 
be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom.
   The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to the requirements of any contractual, legal or regulatory 
selling restrictions in relation to the Placing. Furthermore, it is noted that, notwithstanding the Target Market 
Assessment, Davy will only procure investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible 
counterparties. For the avoidance of doubt, the Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (a) an assessment 
of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID II; or (b) a recommendation to any investor or group of 
investors to invest in, or purchase or take any other action whatsoever with respect to the Placing Shares. Each 
distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Placing Shares and 
determining appropriate distribution channels.
   This Announcement contains (or may contain) certain forward-looking statements with respect to certain of the 
Company's current expectations and projections about future events and the Company's future financial condition 
and performance. These statements, which sometimes use words such as "aim", "anticipate", "believe", "may", 
"will", "should", "intend", "plan", "assume", "estimate", "expect" (or the negative thereof) and words of similar 
meaning, reflect the directors' current beliefs and expectations and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties 
and assumptions, many of which are outside the Company's control and difficult to predict, that could cause actual 
results and performance to differ materially from any expected future results or performance expressed or implied 
by the forward-looking statement. Statements contained in this Announcement regarding past trends or activities 
should not be taken as a representation that such trends or activities will continue in the future. Many factors could 
cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those projected or implied in any 
forward-looking statements. The important factors that could cause the Company's actual results, performance or 
achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the 
macroeconomic environment (including the impact of COVID-19), economic and business cycles, the terms and 
conditions of the Company's financing arrangements, foreign currency rate fluctuations, competition in the 
Company's principal markets, acquisitions or disposals of businesses or assets and trends in the Company's 
principal industries. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such 
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. In light of these risks, uncertainties and 
assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking statements in this Announcement may not occur. The 
information contained in this Announcement, including the forward-looking statements, speaks only as of the date of 
this Announcement and is subject to change without notice and the Company does not assume any responsibility or 
obligation to, and does not intend to, update or revise publicly or review any of the information contained herein, 
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by Euronext Dublin, 
the Central Bank of Ireland, the FCA, the London Stock Exchange, or by applicable law. No statement in this 
Announcement is or is intended to be a profit forecast or profit estimate or to imply that the earnings of the 
Company for the current or future financial years will necessarily match or exceed the historical or published 
earnings of the Company.
   Any indication in this Announcement of the price at which Ordinary Shares have been bought or sold in the past 
cannot be relied upon as a guide to future performance. The price of shares and the income from them may go 
down as well as up and investors may not get back the full amount invested on disposal of shares acquired. Past 
performance is no guide to future performance and persons needing advice should consult an independent financial 
adviser.
   The Placing Shares to be issued pursuant to the Placing will not be admitted to trading on any stock exchange 
other than the Euronext Dublin Market of Euronext Dublin and the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange. 
Persons (including individuals, funds or otherwise) by whom or on whose behalf a commitment to acquire Placing 
Shares has been given ("Placees") will be deemed to have read and understood this Announcement in its entirety 
(including the Appendices) and to be making such offer on the Terms and Conditions in it, and to be providing the 
representations, warranties, indemnities, acknowledgements, and undertakings contained in Appendix 1.

Person (as defined in Appendix 2) and undertakes that it will acquire, hold, manage or dispose of any Placing 
Shares that are allocated to it for the purposes of its business and it is acquiring such shares for its own account; (ii)

States and not a U.S. person (as defined in Regulation S) and is subscribing for the Placing Shares in an "offshore 
transaction" (within the meaning of Regulation S) or (b) a QIB; and (iii) if it is a financial intermediary, as that term is 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Proposed Placing of New -3-
used in Article 2(d) of the Prospectus Regulation, that it understands the resale and transfer restrictions set out in 
Appendix 1 and that any Placing Shares acquired by it in the Placing will not be acquired on a non-discretionary 
basis on behalf of, nor will they be acquired with a view to their offer or resale to, persons in circumstances which 
may give rise to an offer of securities to the public other than an offer or resale in a member state of the EEA to 
Qualified Investors or in the United Kingdom to Relevant Persons, or in circumstances in which the prior consent of 
Davy has been given to each such proposed offer or resale.
   Persons (including, without limitation, nominees and trustees) who have a contractual or other legal obligation to 
forward a copy of Appendix 1 or this Announcement should seek appropriate advice before taking any action.

Announcement and no such prospectus or offering document is required (in accordance with the Prospectus 
Regulation) to be published. This Announcement has not been approved by the Central Bank of Ireland, Euronext

   (nn)       represents and warrants that, unless it is a QIB to whom the Placing Shares will be offered 
on a private placement basis, (a) each of it and each beneficial owner of the Placing Shares for whom it 
is acting is and at the time the Placing Shares are acquired is a non-U.S. Person and will be, located 
outside the United States and is and will be acquiring the Placing Shares in an "offshore transaction" as 
defined in, and in accordance with, Regulation S and (b) it will not offer or sell, directly or 
indirectly, any of the Placing Shares except in an "offshore transaction" in accordance with Regulation S 
or in the United States pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act;
   (oo)      acknowledges and agrees that (i) the transfer of any Placing Shares by a Placee to a non-EU 
National (as defined in the Appendix 2) (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the delivery 
of the Placing Shares by Davy to the Placees in connection with the Placing as described in this 
Announcement) will immediately result in the issuance of a restricted share notice to such non-EU National 
transferee in accordance with the Company's articles of association and the notice issued by the Company 
in February 2002 detailing these restrictions; (ii) the restricted share notice will compel the non-EU 
National transferee to sell the relevant Ordinary Shares to an EU National within 21 days of the date of 
issuance; (iii) in the event that any such non-EU National transferee does not sell the Ordinary Shares to 
an EU National within the specified time period, the Company can then take legal action to compel such a 
sale; (iv) as a result, non-EU Nationals are effectively prohibited from purchasing Ordinary Shares 
(including Placing Shares from any of the Placees) for as long as these restrictions remain in place; and 
(v) there can be no assurance that these restrictions will ever be amended/removed;  and
   (pp)      acknowledges and agrees that in the event that the UK withdraws from the EU without a deal 
(commonly referred to as a "hard" Brexit) and in accordance with the decision of the Directors of the 
Company on 8 March 2019, with effect from the date on which UK nationals cease to qualify as nationals of 
Member States for the purposes of Article 4 of EU Regulation 1008/2008 all Ordinary Shares (including any 
Placing Shares) which are held by or on behalf of non-EU (including UK) Nationals (including Placees) will 
be treated as "Restricted Shares" in accordance with the Company's articles of association and pursuant to 
Article 41(J) of the Company's articles of association the holders of such restricted Ordinary Shares will 
not be entitled to attend, speak or vote at any general meeting of the Company or at any meeting of the 
holders of any class of shares.
   The foregoing acknowledgements, agreements, undertakings, representations, warranties and confirmations 
are given for the benefit of the Company as well as Davy (for their own benefit and, where relevant, the 
benefit of their respective affiliates and any person acting on their behalf) and are irrevocable. Each 
Placee, and any person acting on behalf of a Placee, acknowledges that Davy does not owe any fiduciary or 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Proposed Placing of New -10-
other duties to any Placee in respect of any representations, warranties, undertakings or indemnities in 
the Placing Agreement.
   Please also note that the agreement to allot and issue Placing Shares to Placees (or the persons for 
whom Placees are contracting as agent) free of stamp duty in Ireland and stamp duty reserve tax in the UK 
relates only to their allotment and issue to Placees, or such persons as they nominate as their agents, 
direct from the Company for the Placing Shares in question.
   Such agreement also assumes, and is based on a warranty from each Placee, that the Placing Shares are 
not being acquired in connection with arrangements to issue depositary receipts or to issue or transfer 
the Placing Shares into a clearance service. Neither Davy nor the Company are liable to bear any stamp 
duty or stamp duty reserve tax or any other similar duties or taxes (transfer taxes) that arise on a sale 
of Placing Shares if there are any such arrangements, or any arrangements that arise subsequent to their 
acquisition by Placees or for transfer taxes arising otherwise than under the laws of Ireland or the 
United Kingdom. Each Placee should, therefore, take its own advice as to whether any such transfer tax 
liability arises. Furthermore, each Placee agrees to indemnify on an after-tax basis and hold Davy and/or 
the Company and their respective affiliates harmless from any and all interest, fines or penalties in 
relation to transfer taxes to the extent that such interest, fines or penalties arise from the 
unreasonable default or delay of that Placee or its agent.
   Each Placee and any person acting on behalf of each Placee acknowledges and agrees that Davy or any of 
its affiliates may, at their absolute discretion, agree to become a Placee in respect of some or all of 
the Placing Shares. Each Placee acknowledges and is aware that Davy is receiving a fee in connection with 
its role in respect of the Placing as detailed in the Placing Agreement.
   When a Placee or person acting on behalf of the Placee is dealing with Davy, any money held in an 
account with Davy on behalf of the Placee and/or any person acting on behalf of the Placee will not be 
treated as client money within the meaning of the rules and regulations of the FCA made under the FSMA or 
the Central Bank of Ireland. The Placee acknowledges that the money will not be subject to the protections 
conferred by the client money rules; as a consequence, this money will not be segregated from Davy's money 
in accordance with the client money rules and will be used by Davy in the course of its own business; and 
the Placee will rank only as a general creditor of Davy.
   All times and dates in this Announcement may be subject to amendment by Davy and the Company (in their 
absolute discretion). Davy shall notify the Placees and any person acting on behalf of the Placees of any 
changes.
   Past performance is no guide to future performance and persons needing advice should consult an 
independent financial adviser.
   The rights and remedies of Davy and the Company under these Terms and Conditions are in addition to any 
rights and remedies which would otherwise be available to each of them and the exercise or partial 
exercise of one will not prevent the exercise of others.
   Each Placee may be asked to disclose in writing or orally to Davy information in relation to the 
nationality of the Placee, the beneficial owner of the Placing Shares and/or anyone interested in the 
Placing Shares, including (but not limited to):
    (a)        if he or she is an individual, his nationality; or
   (b)        if he or she is a discretionary fund manager, the jurisdiction in which the funds are 
managed or owned.

to procure placees (the "Placees") for the new ordinary shares of EUR0.006 each in the capital of the 
Company (the "Placing Shares") at a price to be determined following completion of the bookbuilding 
process (the "Bookbuild") (the "Placing").
   The Placing Shares have been duly authorised and will, when issued, be credited as fully paid and will 
rank pari passu in all respects with the existing ordinary shares of EUR0.006 each in the capital of the 
Company (the "Ordinary Shares), including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions 
declared, made or paid in respect of Ordinary Shares after the date of issue. The allotment and issue of 
the Placing Shares will be made by the Company to Placees for cash.
   The Placing Shares will be issued free of any pre-emption rights, encumbrances, liens or other security 
interests.
   Application for listing and admission to trading
   The Company will make applications for the admission of the Placing Shares to (a) a primary listing on 
the Official List of The Irish Stock Exchange plc, trading as Euronext Dublin ("Euronext Dublin") and to 
trading on the Euronext Dublin Market operated by Euronext Dublin (together, the "Irish Admission"); and 
(b) the standard listing segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority of the United 
Kingdom (the "FCA") and to trading on the London Stock Exchange plc's (the "London Stock Exchange") main 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Proposed Placing of New -5-
market for listed securities (together, the "UK Admission" and, together with the Irish Admission, 
"Admission").
   It is expected that Admission will become effective and that dealings will commence in the Placing 
Shares at 8.00 a.m. on 8 September 2020.
   Bookbuild
   Davy will today commence the Bookbuild to determine demand for participation in the Placing by Placees. 
This Appendix 1 gives details of the terms and conditions of, and the mechanics of participation in, the 
Placing. No commissions will be paid to Placees or by Placees in respect of any Placing Shares.
   Participation in, and principal terms of, the Placing
   1.         Davy is acting as sole bookrunner, as agent of the Company in connection with the Placing.
   2.         Participation in the Placing will only be available to persons who may lawfully be, and are, 
invited to participate by Davy. Davy and its affiliates are entitled to enter bids in the Bookbuild as 
principal.
   3.         The Bookbuild will establish a single price payable to Davy as agent for the Company by all 
Placees whose bids are successful (the "Placing Price"). The Placing Price and the number of Placing 
Shares to be issued will be agreed between Davy and the Company following completion of the Bookbuild and 
any discount to the market price of the Ordinary Shares will be determined in accordance with the Irish 
Listing Rules. The Placing Price and the number of Placing Shares will be announced on a Regulatory 
Information Service ("RIS") following the completion of the Bookbuild.
   4.         To bid in the Bookbuild, prospective Placees should communicate their bid by telephone or 
writing to their usual sales or equity capital markets contact at Davy. Each bid must be in Euro and 
should state the number of Placing Shares which the prospective Placee wishes to subscribe for at either 
the Placing Price that is ultimately established by the Company and Davy, or at prices up to a price limit 
specified in its bid. The Placing Price will be contained in the Term Sheet (as defined below) and 
provided to Placees at the time of communicating allocations. Bids may be scaled down by Davy on the basis 
referred to in paragraph 9 below.
   5.         A bid in the Bookbuild will be made on the terms and subject to the conditions in this 
Announcement and will be legally binding on the prospective Placee on behalf of which it is made and, 
except with   Davy's consent, will not be capable of variation or revocation after the time at which it is 
submitted. Each prospective Placee will have an immediate, irrevocable and binding obligation owed to Davy 
to pay to them (or as Davy may direct) in cleared funds (in Euro) at the time set out in paragraph 11, an 
amount equal to the product of the Placing Price and the number of Placing Shares such prospective Placee 
has agreed to subscribe for and the Company has agreed to allot and issue to that Placee. Each prospective 
Placee's obligations will be owed to the Company and Davy. The Company shall allot such Placing Shares to 
each Placee following each Placee's payment to Davy of such amount.
   6.         The Bookbuild is expected to close no later than 5.00 p.m. (Irish time) on 4 September 2020 
but may be closed earlier or later at the discretion of Davy and the Company. Davy may, in its absolute 
discretion, accept bids that are received after the Bookbuild has closed.
   7.         Each prospective Placee's allocation will be determined by Davy and the Company in their 
sole discretion and each Placee's allocation will be confirmed orally by Davy (as an agent of the Company) 
following the close of the Bookbuild and a contract note or electronic confirmation will be despatched 
thereafter. The oral confirmation to such prospective Placee will constitute an irrevocable legally 
binding commitment upon that person (who will at that point become a Placee) in favour of Davy and the 
Company to subscribe for the number of Placing Shares allocated to it at the Placing Price on the terms 
and conditions set out in this Appendix 1 and in accordance with the Company's articles of association and 
all applicable laws.
   8.         Each Placee's allocation and commitment will be evidenced by a contract note or electronic 
confirmation issued to such Placee by Davy. These Terms and Conditions will be deemed incorporated in that 
contract note or electronic confirmation.
   9.         Subject to paragraphs 4 and 5 above, Davy may choose to accept bids, either in whole or in 
part, on the basis of allocations determined in agreement with the Company and may scale down any bids for 
this purpose on such basis as they may determine. Davy may also, notwithstanding paragraphs 4 and 5 above 
and subject to the prior consent of the Company, (i) allocate Placing Shares after the time of any initial 
allocation to any person submitting a bid after that time and/or (ii) allocate Placing Shares after the 
Bookbuild has closed to any person submitting a bid after that time. The acceptance of offers shall be at 
the absolute discretion of Davy. The Company reserves the right (upon agreement with Davy) to reduce or 
seek to increase the amount to be raised pursuant to the Placing, in its absolute discretion.
   10.        Except as required by law or regulation, no press release or other announcement will be made 
by Davy or the Company using the name of any Placee (or its agent), in its capacity as Placee (or agent), 
other than with such Placee's prior written consent.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Proposed Placing of New -5-
   11.        Irrespective of the time at which a Placee's allocation pursuant to the Placing is 
confirmed, settlement of all Placing Shares to be subscribed for pursuant to the Placing will be required 
to be made at the same time, on the basis explained below under "Registration and Settlement".
   12.        All obligations under the Bookbuild and Placing will be subject to fulfilment of the 
conditions referred to below under "Conditions of the Placing" and to the Placing not being terminated on 
the basis referred to below under "Termination of the Placing Agreement". If the Placing Agreement does 
not become unconditional or is terminated, the Placing will not proceed and all funds delivered by a 
Placee as consideration for Placing Shares will be returned.
   13.        By participating in the Bookbuild, each Placee will agree that its rights and obligations in 
respect of the Placing will terminate only in the circumstances described below and will not be capable of 
rescission or termination by the Placee.
   14.        To the fullest extent permissible by law, neither Davy nor the Company nor any of their 
respective affiliates, agents, advisors, directors, officers or employees shall have any responsibility or 
liability to any Placee (or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise) in 
connection with the Placing. In particular, neither Davy nor the Company nor any of their respective 
affiliates, agents, advisors, directors, officers or employees shall have any responsibility or liability 
(including to the fullest extent permissible by law, any fiduciary duties) in respect of Davy's conduct of 
the Bookbuild or of such alternative method of effecting the Placing as Davy and the Company may agree.

amended (the "Securities Act"), or under the securities laws of, or with any securities regulatory 
authority of, any state or other jurisdiction of the United States, and may not be offered, sold or

Ryanair Holdings PLC Proposed Placing of New -4-
Regulation S. No public offering of the shares referred to in this Announcement is being made in Ireland, 
the United Kingdom, the United States, any other Restricted Territory or elsewhere.
   Unless otherwise stated, capitalised terms used in this Appendix 1 have the meanings ascribed to them 
in Appendix 2.
   This Announcement is for information only and does not itself constitute or form part of an offer to 
sell or issue or the solicitation of an offer to buy or subscribe for securities referred to herein in any 
jurisdiction including, without limitation, the United States, any Restricted Territory (as defined below) 
or in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation is unlawful.
   This Announcement, and the information contained herein, is not for release, publication or 
distribution, directly or indirectly, to persons in the United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, the 
Republic of South Africa or in any jurisdiction in which such publication or distribution is restricted, 
unlawful or unauthorised (each a "Restricted Territory"). The distribution of this Announcement and the 
Placing and/or the offer or sale of the Placing Shares in certain jurisdictions may be restricted by law. 
No action has been taken by the Company, Davy or any of their respective affiliates or agents which would 
permit an offer of the Placing Shares or possession or distribution of this Announcement or any other 
offering or publicity material relating to such Placing Shares in any jurisdiction where action for that 
purpose is required. Persons (including, without limitation, nominees and trustees) who have a contractual 
or other legal obligation to forward a copy of this Announcement should seek appropriate advice before

and Davy to inform themselves about, and to observe, any such restrictions.
   No prospectus has been filed with any securities commission or similar regulatory authority in Canada 
in connection with the offer and sale of securities. Any offer and sale of securities in Canada will be 
made on a private placement basis only in the Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Manitoba, and is 
exempt from the requirement that an issuer prepares and files a prospectus under applicable Canadian 
securities laws. Any resale of securities acquired by a Canadian investor in any such offering must be 
made in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws, which resale restrictions may under certain 
circumstances apply to resales of securities outside of Canada. As applicable, each Canadian investor who 
purchases the Placing Shares will be deemed to have represented to the Company, Davy and to each dealer 
from whom a purchase confirmation is received, as applicable, that the investor (i) is purchasing as 
principal, or is deemed to be purchasing as principal in accordance with applicable Canadian securities 
laws, for investment only and not with a view to resale or redistribution; (ii) is an "accredited 
investor" as such term is defined in section 1.1 of National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or, 
in Ontario, as such term is defined in section 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario); and (iii) is a 
"permitted client" as such term is defined in section 1.1 of National Instrument 31-103 Registration 
Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations.
   Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser of 
securities with remedies for rescission or damages if any Placing document that constitutes an offering 
memorandum for the purposes of applicable Canadian securities laws (including any amendment thereto) 
contains a misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the 
purchaser within the time limit prescribed by securities legislation of the purchaser's province or 
territory. The purchaser of securities should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities 
legislation of the purchaser's province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a 
legal advisor. Pursuant to section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts ("NI 33-
105"), any offer of securities will be conducted pursuant to any exemption from the requirement that 
Canadian investors be provided with certain underwriter conflicts of interest disclosure that would 
otherwise be required pursuant to subsection 2.1(1) of NI 33-105.
   Investors should consult their professional advisers if they are in any doubt as to whether or not they 
may receive and accept the Placing.

responsibility or liability to any Placee (or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or 
otherwise) in respect of any decision they may make as to whether or not to waive or to extend the time 
and/or the date for the satisfaction of any condition to the Placing nor for any decision they may make as

any securities of the Company or to trading generally on Euronext Dublin, the London Stock Exchange or the 
NASDAQ stock market, a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance, a 
material change in taxation or the imposition of exchange controls which, in the opinion of Davy (acting 
in good faith), makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the Placing, or the declaration of a 
banking moratorium; or
   (v)           any of the applications of the Company for Admission are withdrawn or refused by Euronext 
Dublin, the London Stock Exchange or the FCA.

(except for any liability arising before or in relation to such termination) from their respective 
obligations under, or pursuant to, the Placing Agreement, subject to certain exceptions.
   By participating in the Placing, Placees agree that the exercise by Davy and/or the Company of any

decision to participate in the Placing based on any other information, representation, warranty or 
statement which the Placee may have obtained or received (regardless of whether or not such information, 
representation, warranty or statement was given or made by or on behalf of any such persons). Each Placee 
acknowledges and agrees that it has relied on its own investigation of the business, financial or other 
position of the Company in accepting a participation in the Placing. Nothing in this paragraph shall

   Following the close of the Bookbuild for the Placing, each Placee allocated Placing Shares in the 
Placing will be sent a contract note or electronic communication stating the number of Placing Shares to 
be allocated to it at the Placing Price and the aggregate amount owed by such Placee to Davy and 
settlement instructions. It is expected that the contract note or electronic communication will be 
despatched on 4 September 2020 and that this will also be the trade date.
   Each Placee agrees that it will do all things necessary to ensure that delivery and payment is 
completed in accordance with either the standing CREST or certificated settlement instructions that it has 
in place with Davy.
   The Company will deliver the Placing Shares to a CREST account operated by Davy as agent for the 
Company and Davy will enter its delivery (DEL) instruction into the CREST system.
   Davy will hold any Placing Shares delivered to this account as nominee for the Placees. The input to 
CREST by a Placee of a matching or acceptance instruction will then allow delivery of the relevant Placing 
Shares to that Placee against payment.
   It is expected that settlement will be on 8 September 2020 on a T + 2 basis in accordance with the 
instructions given to Davy.
   Interest is chargeable daily on payments not received from Placees on the due date in accordance with 
the arrangements set out above at the rate of two percentage points above LIBOR as determined by Davy.
   Each Placee agrees that, if it does not comply with these obligations, Davy may sell any or all of the 
Placing Shares allocated to that Placee on such Placee's behalf and retain from the proceeds, for the 
Company's account and benefit, an amount equal to the aggregate amount owed by the Placee plus any 
interest due. The relevant Placee will, however, remain liable for any shortfall below the aggregate 
amount owed by it and shall be required to bear any stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax or other stamp, 
securities, transfer, registration, execution, documentary or other similar impost, duty or tax (together 
with any interest or penalties) which may arise upon the sale of such Placing Shares on such Placee's 
behalf.
   If Placing Shares are to be delivered to a custodian or settlement agent, Placees should ensure that 
the contract note or electronic communication is copied and delivered immediately to the relevant person 
within that organisation. Insofar as Placing Shares are registered in a Placee's name or that of its 
nominee or in the name of any person for whom a Placee is contracting as agent or that of a nominee for 
such person, such Placing Shares should, subject as provided below, be so registered free from any 
liability to UK or Irish stamp duty or UK stamp duty reserve tax. If there are any circumstances in which 
any other stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (together with interest and penalties) is payable in 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Proposed Placing of New -7-
respect of the issue of the Placing Shares, neither Davy nor the Company shall be responsible for the 
payment thereof.
   Representations and warranties
   By participating in the Placing each Placee (and any person acting on such Placee's behalf) irrevocably 
acknowledges, confirms, undertakes, represents, warrants and agrees (as the case may be) with Davy (in its

Shares are acquired, neither it nor the beneficial owner of the Placing Shares will be, a resident of a 
Restricted Territory or any other jurisdiction in which it would be unlawful to make or accept an offer to 
acquire the Placing Shares, and further acknowledges that the Placing Shares have not been and will not be 
registered or otherwise qualified, for offer and sale nor will an offering document, prospectus or 
admission document be cleared or approved in respect of any of the Placing Shares under the securities 
legislation of the United States or any other Restricted Territory and, subject to certain exceptions, may 
not be offered, sold, transferred, delivered or distributed, directly or indirectly, in or into those 
jurisdictions or in any country or jurisdiction where any such action for that purpose is required;
   (f)         that the content of this Announcement is exclusively the responsibility of the Company and 
that neither Davy nor any of its affiliates nor any person acting on their behalf has or shall have any 
responsibility or liability for any information, representation or statement contained in this 
Announcement or any information previously or subsequently published by or on behalf of the Company, 
including, without limitation, any Exchange Information, and will not be liable for any Placee's decision 
to participate in the Placing based on any information, representation or statement contained in this 
Announcement or any information previously published by or on behalf of the Company or otherwise. Each 
Placee further represents, warrants and agrees that the only information on which it is entitled to rely 
and on which such Placee has relied in committing itself to subscribe for the Placing Shares is contained 
in this Announcement and any Exchange Information, such information being all that it deems necessary to 
make an investment decision in respect of the Placing Shares, and that it has neither received nor relied 
on any other information given or investigations, representations, warranties or statements made by Davy 
or the Company or any of their respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors 
and neither Davy nor the Company or any of their respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees, 
agents or advisors will be liable for any Placee's decision to accept an invitation to participate in the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Proposed Placing of New -7-
Placing based on any other information, representation, warranty or statement. Each Placee further 
acknowledges and agrees that it has relied on its own investigation of the business, financial or other 
position of the Company in deciding to participate in the Placing and that neither Davy nor any of its 
affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors have made any representations to it, 
express or implied, with respect to the Company, the Bookbuild, the Placing and the Placing Shares or the 
accuracy, completeness or adequacy of the Exchange Information, and each of them expressly disclaims any 
liability in respect thereof. Nothing in this paragraph or otherwise in this Announcement excludes the 
liability of any person for fraudulent misrepresentation made by that person;

   (iii) Other reason for the notification could be voluntary notifications, changes of attribution of the

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same 
or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) 
the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.
   In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations 
(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who 
should be mentioned:
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (b) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled 
to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring 
temporarily for consideration the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (c) of the Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
of Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity holding the collateral, provided the person 
or entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and natural person or 
legal entity lodging the collateral under these conditions;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity who has a life interest in shares if that

or legal entity who is disposing of the voting rights when the life interest is created;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (e) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification 
duty at an individual level under Regulation 14 of the Regulations (Article 9 of Directive 2004/109/EC), 
under letters (a) to (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC) or 
under a combination of any of those situations, the controlled undertaking;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (f) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to

the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit

Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;

Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.

Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding

rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.

presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 
2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   RYANAIR CUTS CAPACITY IN SEPT & OCT BY ALMOST 20% AS FORWARD BOOKINGS WEAKEN
   Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, today (Mon 17(th) Aug) announced that it would reduce its flight 
capacity by 20% during the months of Sept & Oct as forward bookings have notably weakened over the last 10 
days, given continuing uncertainty over recent Covid case rates in some EU countries.
   Ryanair confirmed that most of these cuts would be frequency reductions rather than route closures, and 
they will be heavily focused on those countries such as Spain, France and Sweden, where rising recent 
Covid case rates have led to increased travel restrictions, and Ireland which continues to impose a 
uniquely restrictive Green List, which imposes 14 day quarantines on visitors from most other EU countries 
such as Germany (16.3) and the UK (18.6), which have lower Covid case rates over the last 14 days than 
Ireland (22.1).
   A Spokesperson for Ryanair said today:
   " These capacity cuts and frequency reductions for the months of Sept & Oct are necessary given the 
recent weakness in forward bookings due to Covid restrictions in a number of EU countries. Any effected 
passengers in Sept received email notification earlier today advising them of their options. Similar 
communications will be issued to the small number of affected passengers in Oct later today. Over the past 
2 weeks as a number of EU countries have raised travel restrictions, forward bookings especially for 
business travel into Sept & Oct have been negatively affected, and it makes sense to reduce frequencies so 
that we tailor our capacity to demand over the next 2 months.
   Proper testing at airports, and effective tracing (as is being conducted in Germany and Italy) is the 
only realistic and proportionate method of supervising safe intra-EU air travel while effectively limiting 
the spread of the Covid-19 virus."

  COVID-19:
   The past quarter was the most challenging in Ryanair's 35 year history.  Covid-19 grounded the Group's fleet for 
almost 4 months (from mid-March to end June) as EU Governments imposed flight or travel bans and widespread 
population lockdowns.  During this time, Group airlines repatriated customers and operated rescue flights for 
different EU Governments, as well as flying a series of medical emergency/PPE flights across Europe.  Our aircraft 
and crews were kept current by operating skeleton schedules and currency flights which ensured that the Group 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
airlines were ready to efficiently resume flights when lockdown restrictions eased in most EU countries in late 
June/early July.  On 1 July, the Group resumed flights across the majority of our route network.  We expect to 
operate approx. 40% of our normal July schedule, rising to c. 60% in Aug. and, hopefully, 70% in Sept.  The Group 
has implemented extensive health measures through the travel journey, especially onboard aircraft, to comply with 
EU guidelines (published by the ECDC & EASA in May) to ensure that Group airlines maintain the health of our 
guests and crews while minimising the risk of Covid-19.
   Ryanair's Customer Service teams safely returned to the office in June and, with support from Ryanair Labs, they 
are working through an unprecedented volume of customer emails and other communications related to flight 
changes and Covid-19 cancellations, while clearing a record backlog of refunds caused by almost 4 months of EU 
Government imposed flight cancellations.  This process has been delayed by unauthorised screen scrapers 
providing falsified customer details at the time of booking.  It is expected that over 90% of customer cash refund 
requests will be cleared by the end of July.
   At this time, the Group expects FY21 traffic to fall by 60% (from 149m) to just 60m.  The Covid-19 crisis has 
already seen the closure of various EU airlines including Flybe, Germanwings, Level and Sun Express.  It has 
sparked a multi-billion flood of illegal State Aid from EU Governments to their flag carrier airlines including Alitalia, 
Air France/KLM, Lufthansa, SAS, TAP and others.  This illegal State Aid will distort competition and allow 
unsustainable flag carriers to engage in below cost selling for many years to come.  Many other airlines are cutting 
capacity, with the result that air travel in Europe is likely to be depressed for at least the next 2 or 3 years.  This will 
create opportunities for Ryanair (Europe's lowest cost airline group) to grow its network, and expand its fleet, to 
take advantage of lower airport and aircraft cost opportunities that will inevitably arise.
   Q1 BUSINESS REVIEW:
   Revenue & Costs
   Revenue fell by 95% (almost EUR2.2bn) to just EUR125m as traffic dropped 99% at just 0.5m.  An 85% reduction 
in costs during Q1 was not sufficient to offset this revenue loss as bookings came to an abrupt standstill in the initial 
weeks of the Covid-19 crisis.  During the past 3 months significant work has been undertaken to improve Ryanair's 
cost leadership, which is vital if Group airlines are to compete against hugely subsidised flag carriers who will be 
able to engage in below cost selling for years to come.  The Group have negotiated modest pay cuts with our 
people and their unions that will, hopefully, help to avoid widespread job losses.
   Our Route Development teams are working with airports all over Europe who have suffered substantial traffic 
declines during the Covid-19 crisis. Discussions are ongoing with aircraft suppliers to reduce aircraft lease rates 
and purchase prices to reflect the new post Covid-19 reality. The management team at Lauda were forced to 
implement a deep and painful rescue plan, which involved cutting the Lauda fleet from 38 to 30 aircraft in S.20 and 
substantially reducing headcount numbers in Vienna and Germany while closing its 3 aircraft Stuttgart base. Lauda 
worked closely with its people in Vienna to deliver substantial cost savings, enhanced productivity and more 
efficient rosters as without these savings Lauda's main Vienna base would have closed on 29 May last.
   Boeing MAX update
   It is over a year since the Group was due to take delivery of its first Boeing 737-MAX-200 aircraft.  Boeing are 
indicating a late Q3 2020 return to service in the US for the B737-MAX, allowing Ryanair to, hopefully, accept 
delivery of its first MAX-200 before the end of 2020 and potentially up to 40 MAXs ahead of S.2021. We remain 
committed supporters of these "gamechanger" aircraft which have 4% more seats, 16% lower fuel burn and 40% 
lower noise emissions.  These new aircraft will enable the Ryanair Group to grow to 200m passengers p.a. over the 
next 5 or 6 years while reducing the Group's cost base and significantly lowering its environmental footprint.
   Balance Sheet & Liquidity
   Ryanair's balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry with over EUR3.9bn cash at 30 June. We own 333 
unencumbered B737s (with a book value of approx. EUR7bn) and hold a BBB investment grade rating from both 
S&P and Fitch Ratings. Since mid-March, the Group has moved quickly and smartly to preserve cash, cut costs, 
cancel share buybacks and defer all non-essential capex.  This has protected the Group's very strong liquidity 
position as it returns to flying in July.  Over the winter, Ryanair will (as agreed last year) complete the sale of 7 of its 
oldest B737s and will continue to focus on cash preservation/generation and the repayment of maturing debt over 
the next 24 months.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
   BREXIT:
   The challenge of Brexit, and in particular a no-deal Brexit, remains high.  We hope, before the end of the 
Transition Period in Dec., that the UK and Europe will agree a trade deal for air travel which will allow the free 
movement of people and the deregulated airline market between the UK and Ireland to continue.  As an EU airline, 
the Ryanair Group should be less effected by a no-deal Brexit than UK registered airlines.  We still, however, 
expect adverse trading consequences to arise.  Ryanair has put the necessary measures in place to ensure that the 
Group remains majority EU owned, including restricting voting rights of non-EU shareholders, in the event of a 
"hard-Brexit". We therefore expect the Group's AOCs in Austria, Ireland, Malta and Poland to continue to operate 
freely.  In addition, Ryanair's UK AOC (Ryanair UK) will be able to benefit from any bilateral agreements negotiated 
between the UK and non-EU countries while facilitating the operation of domestic UK flights.
   OUTLOOK:
   FY21 will be a very challenging year for the Ryanair Group of airlines.  It is impossible to predict how long the 
Covid-19 pandemic will persist, and a 2(nd) wave of Covid-19 cases across Europe in late autumn (when the 
annual flu season commences) is our biggest fear right now.  Hopefully EU Governments, by implementing effective 
track and tracing systems, and EU citizens by complying with recommended face masks, rigorous hand hygiene 
and other measures, will avoid the need for further lockdowns or restrictions on intra-EU flights.  It is vital that 
European economies begin the process of recovery this summer to minimise the damage arising from the Covid-19 
pandemic and this recovery can only be led by intra-EU air travel which is the engine of EU growth and economic 
activity.
   Given the current uncertainty, Ryanair cannot provide any FY21 PAT guidance at this time.  The Group currently 
expects to carry approx. 60m passengers in FY21 and expects to record a smaller loss in Q2 (which reflects a 
gradual return to flying from 1 July) than in Q1.  However, the Ryanair Group will emerge from the Covid-19 crisis 
with a much lower cost base, which will be essential to fund lower fares as the Group competes against unlawfully 
State aided flag carriers.  Further updates will be provided at Ryanair's AGM in Sept.

Body
   The Group recognises all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in its consolidated 
balance sheet and measures them at fair value. At June 30, 2020, a net liability of EUR755.7M was 
recognised on balance sheet in respect of the Group's jet fuel derivative instruments and a net asset of 
EUR468.5M was recognised in respect of its foreign currency derivative instruments associated with future 
aircraft purchases.
   In determining the hedge effectiveness of derivative instruments used to hedge Ryanair's fuel 
requirements, there is significant judgement involved in assessing whether the volumes of jet fuel hedged 
are still expected to be highly probable forecast transactions. Specifically, significant judgement is 
required in respect of the assumptions related to the timing of the full removal of flight restrictions 
imposed by governments relating to the Covid-19 pandemic, the expected recovery of passenger demand and 
the subsequent flight schedules. All of these assumptions impact upon forecast fuel consumption, and minor 
changes to these assumptions could have a significant effect on the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
   In respect of foreign currency hedge effectiveness for future aircraft purchases, there is a high 
degree of judgement involved in assessing whether the future aircraft payments are still considered highly 
probable of occurring, and the timing of these future payments for aircraft. The timing of future payments 
for aircraft is dependent on the aircraft manufacturer's ability to meet forecast aircraft delivery 
schedules.
   The Group has recorded a charge of EUR13M in relation to unrealised foreign exchange translation of 
U.S. dollar deposits, offset by jet fuel hedge revaluations.
    3.            Seasonality of operations
   The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Accordingly, 
the first half-year has traditionally resulted in higher revenues and results.
    4.            Income tax expense
   The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 
2020 was 11.5% (June 30, 2019: 8.0%).  The tax credit for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 of EUR24.9M (Tax 
charge June 30, 2019: EUR19.4M) comprises a current tax charge of EUR8.2M, a deferred tax credit of 
EUR33.1M primarily relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment and net 
operating losses.
    5.            Share based payments
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -5-
   The terms and conditions of the Company's share based remuneration programmes are disclosed in the most 
recent, published, consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR1.0M in the quarter ended June 30, 
2020 (June 30, 2019: EUR2.5M) is the fair value of options granted in prior periods, which is being 
recognised within the income statement in accordance with employee services rendered.
    6.            Contingencies
   The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
    7.            Capital commitments
   At June 30, 2020 the Group had an operating fleet of 440 (2019: 455) Boeing 737 and 26 (2019: 20) 
Airbus A320 aircraft. The Group has agreed to purchase up to 210 (135 firm and 75 options) Boeing 737-MAX-
200 aircraft from the Boeing Corporation which will deliver (subject to EASA & FAA regulatory approval) 
over the next five or more years.
    8.            Analysis of operating segment
   The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the Group CEO, who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).
   The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the profit/(loss) after tax of each airline 
for the reporting period. Resource allocation decisions for all airlines are based on airline performance 
for the relevant period, with the objective in making these resource allocation decisions being to 
optimize consolidated financial results.
   Ryanair DAC ("Ryanair") is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Buzz, Lauda and Malta 
Air do not exceed the quantitative thresholds for reporting purposes and accordingly have been presented 
on an aggregate basis in the table below.
   There are varying levels of integration between the operating segments. Inter-segment revenue is not 
material and thus not subject to separate disclosure.
   Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

    10.          Property, plant and equipment
   Acquisitions and disposals
   Capital expenditure in the period ended June 30, 2020 amounted to EUR137.4M and primarily relates to 
heavy maintenance checks and aircraft pre-delivery deposits.
    11.          Assets held for sale
   In August 2019, the Group entered into an agreement to sell 10 Boeing 737 aircraft in the years ending 
March 31, 2020 and 2021. 3 of these aircraft were sold during the year ended March 31, 2020. The remaining 
7 aircraft are presented as assets held for sale as at June 30, 2020 and are stated at the lower of their 
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
    12.           Financial instruments and financial risk management
   The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
   These interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the 2019 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year.
   Fair value hierarchy
   Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
   --    Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that 
the Group can access at the measurement date.
   --    Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that 
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
    --    Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

  Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
   MD&A Quarter Ended June 30, 2020
   Income Statement
   Scheduled revenues:
   Scheduled revenues decreased by 93% to EUR100.7M due to a 99% decline in traffic to just 0.5M as EU 
governments imposed flight and / or travel bans due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This grounded approx. 99% of 
the Groups fleet for almost 4 months (from mid-March to late June). Revenue primarily relates to unused 
tickets which are recognised on a systematic basis, such that 12 months of time expired ticket revenue is 
recognised in revenue each fiscal year.
   Ancillary revenues:
   Ancillary revenues decreased by 97% to EUR24.5M due to a 99% decline in traffic (as highlighted above) 
to just 0.5M.
   Total revenues:
   As a result of the above, total revenues decreased by 95% to EUR125.2M.
   Operating Expenses:
   Fuel and oil:
   Fuel and oil decreased by 99% to EUR8.9M due to a 98% reduction in sectors flown due to Covid-19 
related fleet groundings.
   Airport and handling charges:
   Airport and handling charges decreased by 94% to EUR18.1M due to a 98% reduction in sectors.
   Staff costs:
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
   Staff costs decreased 77% to EUR68.5M due to reduced flight hours, a recruitment freeze, Group wide pay 
cuts and participation in EU government payroll support schemes.
   Route charges:
   Route charges decreased by 99% to EUR2.3M due to a 98% decrease in sectors due to Covid-19 related 
fleet groundings.
   Depreciation:
   Depreciation is 30% lower at EUR134.0M, due to reduced aircraft utilisation.
   Marketing, distribution and other:
   Marketing, distribution and other decreased by 71% to EUR42.4M as the Group reduced discretionary 
spending.
   Maintenance, materials and repairs:
   Maintenance, materials and repairs decreased by 47% to EUR36.2M due to reduced utilisation of aircraft.
   Aircraft rentals:
   Aircraft rentals fell by 84% to EUR2.4M due to 12 fewer leased B737 aircraft in the fleet.
   Other expense:
   Other expense increased by EUR9.5M to EUR22.4M primarily due to unrealised foreign exchange losses on 
translation of U.S. dollar deposits, offset by jet fuel hedge revaluations and higher deposit interest.
   Balance sheet:
   Gross cash increased by EUR128.0M to EUR3,936.0M at June 30, 2020.
   Gross debt rose by EUR597.0M to EUR4,808.2M due to raising EUR690M unsecured debt under the HMT and 
Bank of England CCFF, offset by EUR68.0M debt repayments and EUR20.5M lease liability payments.
   Net debt was EUR872.2M at period end. (March 2020: EUR403.2M).
   Shareholders' equity:
   Shareholders' equity decreased by EUR248.2M to EUR4,666.3M in the period due to a net loss of EUR185.1M 
and IFRS hedge accounting treatment for derivatives of EUR69.9M.
   Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
   Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
   Interim Financial Statements
    1.             Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
   Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The unaudited condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 comprise the 
Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
   These 
unaudited 
condensed 
consolidated 
interim 
financial 
statements 
("the 
interim 
financial 
statements"), which should be read in conjunction with our 2019 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 
2019, have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial 
Reporting" as adopted by the EU ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full 
annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2019, are available at http://investor.ryanair.com/ .
   The June 30, 2020 figures and the June 30, 2019 comparative figures do not constitute statutory 
financial statements of the Group within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2014. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 31, 2019, together with the independent 
auditor's report thereon, were filed with the Irish Registrar of Companies following the Company's Annual 
General Meeting and are also available on the Company's Website. The auditor's report on those financial 
statements was unqualified.
   The Board of Directors approved the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the quarter 
ended June 30, 2020 on July 23, 2020.
   Except as stated otherwise below, this year's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
   Accounting for assets held for sale
   Non-current assets are classified as held-for sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered 
primarily through sale rather than through continuing use. Such assets are generally measured at the lower 
of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses on initial classification as 
held-for-sale or held-for distribution and subsequent gains and losses on re-measurement are recognised in 
the income statement. Once classified as held-for-sale, intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment are no longer amortised or depreciated, and any equity-accounted investee is no longer equity 
accounted.
   New IFRS standards and amendments adopted during the year
   The following new and amended IFRS standards, amendments and IFRIC interpretations, have been issued by 
the IASB, and have also been endorsed by the EU. These standards are effective for the first time for the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
Group's financial year beginning on April 1, 2020 and therefore have been applied by the Group in these 
condensed consolidated interim financial statements:
   --    Amendments to IFRS 3 - Definition of a Business (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after January 1, 2020)
   --    Amendments to References to Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards (effective for fiscal periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2020)
   --    Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 - Definition of Material (effective for fiscal periods beginning on 
or after January 1, 2020)
   --    Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7) (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020)
   The adoption of these new or amended standards did not have a material impact on the Group's financial 
position or results from operations in the quarter ended June 30, 2020.
   New IFRS standards and amendments issued but not yet effective
   The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for the purposes 
of the preparation of future financial statements, where applicable.  While under review, we do not 
anticipate that the adoption of the other new or revised standards and interpretations will have a 
material impact on our financial position or results from operations:
   --    IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 
2023)
   --    Classification of liabilities as current or non-current (Amendments to IAS 1) (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023)
   --    Amendments to IFRS 3 - Business Combinations, IFRS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment, IAS 37 - 
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, and Annual Improvements 2018 - 2020 (effective 
for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022)
   --    Amendment to IFRS 16 - Leases Covid-19 Related Rent Concessions (effective for fiscal periods 
beginning on or after June 1, 2020)
   --    Amendment to IFRS 4 - Insurance Contracts - deferral of IFRS 9 (effective for fiscal periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2021)
    2.            Judgements and estimates
   In preparing these financial statements, management has made judgements and estimates that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
   In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements made 
by management in applying the Group's accounting policies have been re-evaluated in light of Covid-19. The 
key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the most recent published 
consolidated financial statements
   Derivative financial instruments
   The Group uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to market risks, 
including the risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices and currency exchange rates. Ryanair uses 
forward contracts for the purchase of its jet fuel (jet kerosene) requirements to reduce its exposure to 
commodity price risk. It also uses foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to risks 
related to foreign currencies, principally the U.S. dollar exposure associated with the purchase of new 
Boeing 737 aircraft and the U.S. dollar exposure associated with the purchase of jet fuel.

   Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
   Financial instruments measured at fair value
   --    Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to determine the 
fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
   --          Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and EUA contracts: A comparison of 
the contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at June 30, 2020 has 
been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
   The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the quarter ended June 30, 2020, there 
were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
   Financial instruments not measured at fair value
   --          Long-term debt: The repayments which the Group is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at June 30, 2020 to arrive at 
a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
   There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the quarter ended 
June 30, 2020 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.
    12.           Financial instruments and financial risk management (continued)
   The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated balance sheet, are as follows:

    13.          Shareholder returns
   There were no share buybacks during the quarter ended June 30, 2020.
   In FY20 the Company bought back 47.2M shares at a total cost of EUR581M.  This buyback was equivalent 
to approximately 4.2% of the Company's issued share capital at March 31, 2020.  All of these repurchased 
ordinary shares were cancelled at March 31, 2020.
   As a result of the share buybacks in the year ended March 31, 2020, share capital decreased by 47.2M 
ordinary shares with a nominal value of EUR581M and the other undenominated capital reserve increased by a 
corresponding EUR0.3M. The other undenominated capital reserve is required to be created under Irish law 
to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.

    14.          Related party transactions
   The Company's related parties comprise its subsidiaries, Directors and senior key management personnel. 
All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
   There were no related party transactions in the quarter ended June 30, 2020 that materially affected 
the financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no changes in 
the related party transactions described in the 2019 Annual Report that could have a material effect on 
the financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.
    15.          Post balance sheet events
   On July 1, 2020, the Group resumed flying across the majority of its route network. We expect to 
operate approx. 40% of our normal July schedule, rising to approx. 60% in August and hopefully approx. 70% 
in September 2020. The Group is forecasting traffic of approx. 60m guests in FY21. The full extent of the 
ongoing impact of Covid-19 on the Group's longer-term operational and financial performance will depend on 
future developments, many of which are outside its control, including the duration and spread of Covid-19 
and related travel advisories and restrictions, the impact of Covid-19 on overall long term demand for air 
travel, the impact of Covid-19 on the financial health and operations of the Group's business partners 
(particularly Boeing), and future EU Governmental actions, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be 
predicted.
   The Boeing 737-MAX, which was grounded in 2019, has undergone extensive regulatory testing and it is 
expected to return to service in North America in Q3 calendar 2020, which we hope will enable the Group to 
accept delivery of its first Boeing 737-MAX-200 aircraft before the end of 2020.

at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the

   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).

reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   RYANAIR AND ITS IRISH PILOTS AGREE ON PAY CUTS
   TO SAVE IRISH PILOT JOBS
   Ryanair today (3 July) welcomed acceptance by 100% of its Irish Pilots of a 4-year agreement which 
includes a 20% pay reduction, restored over 4 years, along with productivity improvements on rosters, 
flexible working patterns and annual leave to minimise Irish Pilot job losses. This agreement gives 
Ryanair a framework to flex its operation during the Covid-19 crisis and a pathway to recovery when the 
business returns to normal in the years ahead.
   Earlier this week BALPA and Ryanair UK pilots accepted a similar deal to save jobs also with 20% pay 
cuts and productivity improvements.
   Ryanair has also signed agreements with the Fórsa union for our Irish based cabin crew and the UNITE 
union for our UK cabin crew on up to 10% pay reductions, fully restored over 4 years as well as 
productivity improvements to save jobs. These cabin crew agreements are currently out to ballot.
   These agreements demonstrate that Ryanair Pilots wish to work with the airline during the Covid-19 
crisis where Ryanair will carry 50% less traffic, at significantly lower fares for the foreseeable future.
   Ryanair's CEO Eddie Wilson said:
   "We welcome this week's results in both Ireland and the UK of acceptance of a 4-year agreement on 20% 
pay cuts and productivity improvements on rosters and flexible working patterns to save the maximum number 
of Irish and UK Pilot jobs. The strength of this acceptance demonstrates the commitment from our pilots in 
Ireland and the UK to work with Ryanair as we work our way through this crisis over the next number of 
years".

   TOTAL VOTING RIGHTS
   In conformity with Regulation 20 of the Transparency (Directive 2004/109 EC) Regulations 2007 (as amended), 
Ryanair announces that as at 30 June 2020:
   Ryanair's issued share capital consists of  1,090,049,737  Ordinary Shares of nominal value EUR0.006 each with 
voting rights. Ryanair does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury.  Therefore, the total number of voting rights in 
Ryanair is 1,090,049,737 .
   The above figure may be used by shareholders as a denominator for the calculation by which they will determine 
if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, Ryanair under the Transparency 
(Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 (as amended) and the Interim Transparency Rules of the Central Bank.

   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.

Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding

   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the

   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   Ryanair OPENS 64 routes to/from Vienna FROM 1(ST) jULY
   THOUSANDS OF EUR9.99 FARES - BEFORE AUsTRIAN GOVT BANS THEM!!!
   Ryanair, Europe's No.1 airline, today (Thurs 25(th) June) announced it will open 67 routes to/from 
Austria commencing on Wed 1(st) July next, as part of Ryanair's post Covid Summer 2020 schedule. Its 
Vienna base will offer 64 routes, including summer services to Palma, Rome, Faro & Athens, and many more.
   As Austrians taxes get wasted on illegal State Aid to German owned Austrian Airlines, Ryanair will 
guarantee low fares for Austrian customers/visitors at prices which start from EUR9.99 one way. Vienna 
holidaymakers can now plan an exciting summer getaway with fares starting from just EUR9.99 for travel in 
July & August before some misguided Austrian Minister tries to ban them.
   Following the reopening of Lauda's Vienna A320 base on 1 July, Ryanair will operate to/from Vienna on a 
mixture of Boeing and Airbus aircraft. Since Lauda will become a wet lease provider for the Ryanair Group, 
the famous red brand will continue to fly over the skies of Austria from 1(st) July.
   Ryanair's Austria 2020 schedule will deliver:
   64 Vienna routes including;
    --    Over 25 summer destination including Faro, Malaga, Malta, Naples & Palma.
    --    Over 20 city break destinations including Dublin, Milan, Madrid, Lisbon & Warsaw.
    --    Ryanair will also operate 2 routes to/from Salzburg and 1 route to/from Klagenfurt.
   Ryanair Group CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
   "Ryanair is pleased to open 67 new routes to/from Austria starting from 1 July, as part of our Summer 
2020 schedule. Our Vienna base will serve 64 routes, with air fares starting from just EUR9.99 one way 
before some crazy Austrian Minister tries to force Austrian consumers and visitors to pay higher EUR40 air

   22 June 2020
   SDL plc
   ("SDL" or the "Group")
   SDL Launches SLATE Self-service, On-demand Translation Solution
   SLATE combines SDL's Linguistic AI (TM), advanced neural machine translation and expert translation 
services to deliver on-demand, secure content translation for business
   SDL (LSE: SDL), the intelligent language and content company, announces the launch of SLATE - Smart 
Language Translation for the Enterprise - its new self-service platform for secure, on-demand translation. 
Based on a subscription model, SLATE enables professionals in any part of a business to directly access 
secure, world-class neural machine translation, with most content processed instantly, along with optional 
expert human review.
   Through the intuitive, self-service online platform, SLATE provides all parts of a business with access 
to SDL's world-class and secure neural machine translation, covering dozens of languages including some of 
the world's most difficult, like Chinese, Korean and Russian. When required, users can easily upgrade the 
service within the same application to human review or revision, which is delivered by SDL's trusted 
network of over 17,000 expert translators. Operating under a monthly subscription model based on typical 
document volumes means predictable spend for customers and transparent service levels and delivery times, 
with most content being processed instantly. SLATE works with many different formats, from Microsoft Word 
documents and PDFs, to Adobe InDesign files and subtitles for videos.
   "SLATE was fast and brilliant - it was instant, professional, and the output looked exactly like the 
original," said Carolann Conway, Executive Assistant to Chief Legal & Regulatory Officer, Ryanair DAC. "No 
one that received the document had negative feedback on the quality of content. I appreciate that I can 
get my document professionally translated right away with no hidden costs, no wait time for a project 
quote, and no extra work for me. SLATE is foolproof."
   Built for business users across marketing, financial, legal and other regulated and security-conscious 
industries, SLATE's key features include:
    --    One-click access to document translation and support for dozens of languages
    --    Always on, always available
SDL PLC Launch of SLATE
    --    Automatically translates whilst preserving document formats
   --    Ideal for regulated industries as it is secure by design and does not allow for content sharing 
or re-use between users or by the system
   "We are extremely excited to launch this new on - demand service designed to support professionals in 
departments and enterprises, who have pressing needs for high quality translation and want it delivered in 
a simple, automated way," s aid Christophe Djaouani, EVP Regulated Industries at SDL. "SLATE has 
simplified the process, improved efficiency and thereby reduced the time-to-market for our customers. 
Built for business, it has tight security that conforms to strict industry standards, making it highly-
suited for users in regulated industries. We look forward to rolling this service out and supporting a 
segment of the market that has long been neglected."
   Other benefits of SLATE's monthly subscription model are that it significantly reduces the up-front 
financial commitment for customers and eliminates the typical wait time for project quotes and invoices. 
SLATE offers three levels of service starting with 'Automatic,' backed by SDL Machine Translation, which 
is sufficient for the majority of tasks, to the human optimized stages of 'Review,' focused on accuracy, 
and 'Revision,' that combines correcting for accuracy along with stylistic improvements, resulting in 
professionally edited output.

Body
   Our strategy is to focus on developing valuable growth assets in two sectors; aviation and energy from waste. We 
have two core assets: London Southend Airport, which will be developed to respond to the challenges presented by 
the COVID-19 pandemic; and a highly cash generative energy from waste feedstock supply business, Stobart 
Energy. Both these businesses saw significant operational progress in 2019.
   So that we are free to focus on developing these valuable assets we are also taking action to clean up the non-
core legacy investments and infrastructure across the Group. By taking sometimes difficult decisions we can draw a 
line under the past and improve the balance sheet for future periods. That in turn will enable us to set this business 
on a path to creating significant shareholder value.
   What progress was made in the Aviation division during the year?
   London Southend became the UK's fastest growing airport in 2019 according to Civil Aviation Authority data with 
passenger numbers for the full year up 43.1% to 2.1 million. From April 2019, Ryanair based three aircraft at the 
airport and operated flights to 13 destinations. Loganair commenced operations in May, and Wizz Air launched new 
routes in October and November 2019. The established easyJet routes also continued to see improvements in load 
factors.
   However, perhaps the biggest boon to our long-term non-aeronautical revenues was the commencement of 
operations to support the import and export of goods at our new global logistics operation in October 2019.
   The airport has an improved retail offering, optimised its surface access income and added a logistics operation. 
These improvements contributed to underlying EBITDA per passenger increasing 36.6% to GBP4.33 during the 
year.
   What about your other aviation assets?
   Stobart Aviation Services made significant gains through delivering a differentiated, technology-led model. It now 
provides airline services across five airports, working with 16 airlines. This operational progress across our aviation 
assets meant that we were able to increase revenues for the division by 44.1% to GBP56.8m. Underlying EBITDA 
went up by 73.8% to GBP8.6m. The Aviation division made a total loss before tax of GBP9.8m, with almost all of 
this loss reflecting new business and contract set-up costs.
   How did Stobart Energy perform during the year?
Stobart Group Limited Full Year Results -3-
   Stobart Energy enjoyed a transformational year where plants were all operational with the exception of one. The 
one plant, Port Clarence, that was not commissioned negotiated the termination of its fuel supply agreement in the 
year. This generated GBP4.7m which is stated in other income in our accounts.
   The Tilbury renewable energy plant experienced a seven-month unexpected outage caused by a dust explosion. 
Stobart Energy has protections against loss of revenue associated with that outage through the 'take or pay' 
provisions of its contract. The exact amount owed under these provisions is being finalised.
   The investment in processing and storage sites is now largely complete and the fleet of trucks and trailers has 
been replenished. Going forwards we will benefit from a newly appointed management team. Richard Jenkins 
joined the Executive Board as Chief Executive in June 2020. He has significant experience having managed the 
Greater Manchester Waste contract. Gareth Aylward joined Stobart Energy in May 2020 as Finance Director from 
Ornua Co-operative Limited.
   What are your plans for your non-core assets?
   The performance of Stobart Rail & Civils has been poor in recent years, reflecting the impact of legacy contracts. 
COVID-19 has further exacerbated the loss-making position of the division and we see no prospect of the business 
making a profit in the short term. The Group has therefore taken the decision to exit the business during FY21. To 
that end, the Group is in active dialogue with interested parties.
   We were disappointed that we were unable to keep Flybe flying. Despite the best efforts of everyone involved, the 
delay to receiving EU merger clearance, coupled with the impact of COVID-19 meant the Connect Airways 
consortium was not in a position to continue funding it. Flybe entered administration in March 2020 with Connect 
Airways following it shortly afterward. This resulted in the GBP45.1m impairment of loans to GBPnil. This 
impairment has been presented within non-underlying items.
   What has been the impact of COVID-19 on the business and what is the outlook for the year?
   Like most businesses we have experienced significant challenges since the end of our financial year due to the 
COVID-19 crisis.
   The crisis meant that the airport was largely closed to commercial passengers from late March 2020. However, 
our logistics operation continued throughout the COVID-19 crisis, providing a valuable source of income. It's not 
possible right now to say what will happen in terms of passenger demand in the immediate term. What we do know 
is that people will ultimately return to flying and that airlines will be focused on cost management. We will be well 
placed to deliver a cost-efficient proposition that reflects the relative low-cost development of the airport to date 
compared to London airport peers.
   We also want to take this opportunity to build on London Southend Airport's legacy as a customer-friendly airport, 
as repeatedly recognised by Which?, and modernise it for the new decade and the post-COVID-19 world we will be 
living in. At the heart of our strategy is a frictionless approach, where touchpoints will be minimised, bottlenecks will 
be eased and the overall time between arrival and take-off is reduced.
   The challenge that Stobart Energy faced was the supply of waste wood. The halt to construction work and the 
closure of Household Waste and Recycling Centres due to the lockdown impacted on the availability of waste 
woods and had a knock-on effect on gate fees. However, the supply of waste wood is improving as the lockdown 
begins to ease and we are benefiting from a proven national supply chain including over 300 suppliers to ensure we 
can access the waste wood that is available. We have strong relationships with plants across the UK and have 
maintained continuous dialogue regarding supply expectations during this crisis. As a result, we are now well 
placed to consolidate our market position further once construction resumes in earnest.
   That airport passenger-focused future, which is ready to capitalise on a recovery in the wider short-haul aviation 
sector, sits squarely next to a strong performing energy from waste business. We will ultimately seek to monetise 
the energy business in the next 18 to 24 months, providing further capital that can be invested in our aviation 
businesses. We plan to dispose of our non-core assets within the next three years.
   Our core businesses, supported by our great teams, show therefore that Stobart Group is ready for the 
opportunities of the new decade.

   Operational Review - Stobart Aviation
   London Southend Airport made considerable progress throughout 2019, ending the year as the UK's fastest 
growing airport according to Civil Aviation Authority data. However, there is no escaping the challenges that the 
aviation industry and the world as a whole continues to face since our year end.
Stobart Group Limited Full Year Results -3-
   Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, London Southend Airport has worked to support its airline 
partners, as they reduce operations to zero in the short term and ground their fleets. A large number of aircraft were 
subsequently parked at the airport and the key now is to maintain strong relationships so that we are well placed to 
return to normal operations as soon as services are reinstated.
   The strength of those relationships became clear in 2019. We have a long-standing partnership with easyJet and 
its four based aircraft saw a strong load factor performance across the year. In April 2019, we welcomed three 
Ryanair aircraft, flying 16 routes. In October 2019, we announced that Wizz Air would be operating three routes 
from Winter 2019/20.
   Along with the major low-cost carriers, we developed new relationships with Loganair and FlyOne and all of this 
helped us to record a 43.1% increase in passenger numbers in the year, to 2.1 million (2019: 1.5 million).
   Of course, like everyone within the aviation industry, we were greatly saddened by the news that Flybe was 
entering administration. It is important to acknowledge the great customer experience delivered by their more than 
2,000 employees.
   The 43.1% increase in passenger numbers during the year was achieved without compromising our own 
customer experience. Over 84% of flights departed on time (up 5% on last year) and our quick and easy passenger 
experience was maintained. Passengers waited in security queues for just 124 seconds on average. Getting 
passengers through security quickly meant they had more time to enjoy our growing range of retail outlets. During 
the year, we added Dixons and hope to shortly add Boots to a range that already included Costa Coffee, Giraffe, 
WHSmith, Bourgee and our bespoke pub, The Navigator.
   The quick and easy passenger experience and growing retail offering created even more happy passenger 
experiences. The airport recorded an 84% Happy or Not score during the year. That reputation for great passenger 
experience will be important as we work to attract airlines and passengers once flights return in earnest.
   It's not just the airport itself that made progress. New early and late trains and bus services were introduced. We 
changed our car parking policies to introduce a new fee structure. And Stobart Jet Centre also continued to improve 
its brand awareness and appointed a new Managing Director, Fiona Langton.

   In early 2020, London Southend Airport served approximately 40 destinations across Europe and the United 
Kingdom with flights operated by easyJet, Ryanair, Loganair, Wizz Air and Flybe, amongst others. Since year-end, 
Flybe has entered into Administration and ceased flight operations.
   In FY19/20, easyJet and Ryanair accounted for, in aggregate, approximately 85 per cent. of the airport's 
passenger traffic.
   London Southend Airport has more than 1,100 square metres of retail space served by seven retail clients 
operating 10 retail outlets. The largest retail client in London Southend Airport is The Restaurant Group, which 
operates a number of food concessions and in FY19/20 comprised more than a third of the airport's retail 
concession fees.
   The airport also has a hotel facility on site. The Group sold the hotel to Interstate Hotels & Resorts in FY17/18 
pursuant to a sale and leaseback agreement under which the Group continues to operate and generate revenue 
from the hotel.
   In October 2019, the Group announced that it had entered into an initial two-year agreement with a global 
logistics customer to provide facilities and expertise to support the import and export of goods at London Southend 
Airport. The Group provides runway access and import/export facilities by converting existing hangarage on the 
north side of the runway, away from the south-side based commercial passenger operations.
   In 2011, the Stobart Rail & Civils operating division built a train station at London Southend Airport which serves 
central London with up to six trains per hour during peak times. The journey to London takes approximately 52 
minutes, and in FY19/20 approximately 30 per cent. of London Southend Airport passengers travelled to/from the 
airport by train. The Group receives a share of ticket fares from people using the station at London Southend 
Airport.
   The Group also operates the Stobart Jet Centre located at the London Southend Airport, which offers private 
aviation services. The Stobart Jet Centre had 908, 1,660 and 1,512 movements in FY17/18, FY18/19 and FY19/20.
   Passenger experience
Stobart Group Limited Proposed Placing and Open -11-
   The Directors believe that, as a result of COVID-19, airports will be expected to provide clean, secure and 
spacious environments in which passengers are not expected to gather in confined retail spaces, where cleaners 
are highly visible and where people can move through central search areas efficiently.
   The Directors believe that London Southend Airport has a highly flexible, modular and cost-efficient capital 
expenditure plan with minimal passenger disruption. The Directors believe that London Southend Airport has an 
opportunity therefore to make use of significant unutilised space and enhanced technology, provide a cost-efficient 
base for airlines given the airport's lower capital expenditure to date, and deliver a passenger-focused experience 
for its customers.
   The enhancements that the Company expects to make to London Southend Airport as a result of COVID-19 
include the following:
   -- Thermal cameras are expected to be installed to monitor passenger temperatures as they approach the 
entrance to the departure terminal, allowing airport staff to identify potential infected people and take appropriate 
action. Social distancing markers will be located on the floor. Only passengers and staff will be allowed in the 
terminal during the short term.
   -- Face masks will be mandatory on entering the airport and masks will be provided to all passengers that do not 
have their own. Over 30 hand sanitiser stations and large wipe dispensers will be strategically located throughout 
the airport journey. The airport's cleaning team will be highly visible.
   -- Bio shields are expected to be installed to protect passengers and staff when presenting at check-in. 
Automated self-service check-in and bag drops are expected to be introduced in 2021.
   -- Passengers will use self-service boarding card machines. The security process will use noncontact CTiX search 
machines, and advanced baggage scanning devices have now been installed.
   -- After security, passengers will move through to a large, open-plan departure lounge. The airport will use short-
queue departure gates with passengers called to their gate in small groups according to their row number.
   -- Arriving passengers will be kept separate to departing passengers. Their luggage will be scanned by ultraviolet 
technology. Security and departures terminal areas are expected to be extended in 2023 following the construction 
of a new arrivals terminal.
   Stobart Aviation Services
   Stobart Aviation Services began operating in FY17/18 and provides check-in, baggage handling and cargo 
services at London Stansted, London Southend, Manchester, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports.
   The Group has contracts with 16 airlines, including easyJet, Scandinavian airlines (SAS), Loganair, Wizz, Titan, 
Ryanair, Norwegian, Eurowings and SN Brussels. The Group's Aviation Services contracts employ cost-plus, fixed 
cost and price per turn contracts used to appeal to both larger and smaller airlines to be handled on a frequent or 
ad hoc basis, and the contracts vary in duration, but are typically three to five years.
   Teesside International Airport-Strategic Partnership
   In March 2019, the Group entered into a strategic partnership with the Tees Valley Combined Authority (TVCA) to 
provide management services in respect of the Teesside International Airport, for which the Group receives an 
annual fee. The Group also holds a stake in the airport's holding company, which provides for the Group to share in 
a portion of the equity.
   Teesside International Airport largely serves the private aviation market and also includes a flight school, air 
ambulance operations, a fire training centre and a base for defence contractors. In early 2020, Teesside 
International Airport announced that commercial flights would begin to a number of destinations in the United 
Kingdom and Europe. However, commercial flight operations have been suspended due to the COVID-19 
pandemic.
   Stobart Energy
   The Directors believe that the Group is the United Kingdom's largest supplier of waste wood fuel to UK biomass 
energy plants, with long-term exclusive contracts in place with some of the largest biomass energy plants in the 
United Kingdom. The Group has contracts in place to supply 1.7 million tonnes of waste wood fuel and in FY19/20 
supplied 1.5 million tonnes. The Group aims to identify a strategic buyer or infrastructure investor to monetise 
Stobart Energy in the next 18-24 months in order to fund future growth at London Southend Airport.
   Biomass energy (including waste wood fuel) is generated using plant-based products, including wood pellets and 
wood chips, bioenergy crops and agricultural and domestic waste. The plant-based products are processed to 
create a low-carbon, renewable alternative to fossil fuels. Bioenergy (including waste wood fuel) is Britain's second 
largest source of renewable electricity (according to UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy 
Stobart Group Limited Proposed Placing and Open -11-
statistics), and the UK Committee on Climate Change has stated that sustainably sourced bioenergy could provide 
up to 15 per cent. of the United Kingdom's primary energy by 2050.
   The Group offers a range of solutions across the biomass energy supply chain, from commercial waste collection 
through to producing fuel to a specification and delivering fuel to biomass energy plants using its large logistics 
function. The Group has expertise in waste wood, virgin wood, refuse derived fuel (RDF) and solid recovered fuel 
(SRF). Stobart Energy employs more than 350 people, operates 145 walking floor vehicles and operates six large 
fuel production and storage facilities, with a significant number of other fuel production and storage sites contracted 
to third parties to operate. The Group supplies more than 15 large, and a significant number of smaller, biomass 
energy plants in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
   The following table sets forth Stobart Energy's actual tonnage of waste wood fuel supplied, revenue, profit before 
tax from continuing operations and Underlying Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated.

Underlying EBITDA in the FY18/19 Financial Statements and FY19/20 Financial Statements.
   Market and Competition
   Gate fees in November 2019 declined significantly due to a combination of a seasonal decline in waste wood 
supply, demand from UK biomass energy plants peaking and a six-month drop in construction output due to Brexit 
uncertainties. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this trend, leading to a significant slowdown in 
construction activity, a 75 per cent. decrease in commercial and industrial waste arisings year-on-year and the 
closure of household waste and recycling centres.
   Without these key sources of supply, the Group's inbound waste wood supply decreased as much as 80 per cent. 
year-on-year, although has started to recover.
   Pre-COVID-19, approximately five million tonnes of waste wood were produced annually in the United Kingdom, 
with a large proportion of this used as fuel for biomass energy plants. Supply of timber is generally low in the winter 
months in the United Kingdom, whilst fuel demand increases during that time due to the cold weather.

Body
   In addition, the demand for green energy from recycled waste will continue and underpins the future of our Energy 
from Waste business. It appears that the UK Government sees the construction industry playing an important role in 
re-opening the economy and this will assist in the supply of recycled wood for our operations.
   The Board and Senior Management team reacted quickly in response to the pandemic ahead of the lockdown. 
We took immediate action to protect our people and customers with their safety being paramount. All discretionary 
expenditure was frozen including capital expenditure except where required for safety critical purposes. We 
maintained firm control over cash flow and reviewed our short- and medium-term plans to ensure that we could 
sustain the business through lockdown while also engaging in discussions around seeking further funding for the 
Group. We have today announced an equity issue and additional bank facilities which I refer to below.
   As a result of the significant drop in activity levels it was necessary to place a number of staff on furlough and in 
line with many other businesses, we utilised support from the Government. We continue to maintain support for all 
those members of staff as a part of the Stobart Community. In addition, the Board and the Senior Management 
Team across the business agreed to voluntary pay cuts. We are putting in place enhanced health and safety 
processes to protect colleagues and customers and give them confidence as we start to return gradually from 
lockdown.
   Results
   The business continued to make positive progress at an operating level in its core businesses during the year. 
Passengers at London Southend Airport were up by 43% and waste wood tonnage supplied by our Energy from 
Waste business was up by 12%. We made good progress with our key airline partners easyJet, Ryanair and Wizz 
Air and secured a contract with a major global logistics business which has maintained its activity levels during the 
lockdown period.
   These results were adversely affected by the impact of issues which continued to affect our non-core operations, 
resulting in a loss for the year of GBP137.9m. The Rail & Civils business was impacted by continuing costs on a 
legacy contract which necessitated a further provision in the year. This business is unlikely to generate the 
appropriate returns for shareholders given the risks and we have decided to withdraw from this sector during the 
Stobart Group Limited Full Year Results -2-
course of FY21. An impairment of GBP8.5m to the carrying value of this business was recognised in the half year 
results.
   The widely reported issues experienced by Eddie Stobart Logistics plc ('ESL') during the latter part of last year led 
to a reduction in the value of the residual investment in that business. These issues also brought into focus the 
confusion which existed with our stakeholders around the Stobart name and led to the recently announced sale of 
the Stobart brands to ESL for GBP10m. We will announce a new name for the Group in the course of FY21 and 
over the next three years will remove the use of the Stobart name from all operations. The reduction in value of the 
ESL investment recognised during the year along with the amortisation and impairment of the brand, totaled 
GBP67.5m.
   Our investment, including receivables, in Connect Airways was impaired fully at the year end leading to a loss in 
value of GBP54.2m. Post year end, Connect Airways and its subsidiary Flybe entered Administration. The proposed 
rescue finance package for Flybe was impacted by the emerging COVID-19 crisis and led to the unfortunate failure 
of that business. The Stobart Air and Propius aircraft leasing businesses had been sold into Connect as part of the 
consortium deal to acquire Flybe and continued to operate outside of the Administration servicing a viable franchise 
arrangement with Aer Lingus. In view of certain legacy guarantees and obligations associated with the Group's 
previous ownership it was decided to buy back these businesses from the Administrator and this deal completed in 
April 2020. The Group plan to continue to operate this business while working with Aer Lingus to identify a new 
partner to take business forward. The Group will seek to mitigate its legacy liabilities and plans to exit the business 
fully once the crisis period has passed.
   Finally, a realistic assessment of all legacy infrastructure assets was taken with further impairments totalling 
GBP29.4m being made in light of expected market conditions. The Group is committed to realising these assets 
over the next three years with the clear objective being on achieving value for shareholders.
   Strategy & Funding
   The Board undertook its annual review of strategy in September 2019 and commenced a number of work streams 
to determine the future opportunities for each business segment and the funding needs to support its ambitious 
growth plans. One of the decisions made at the half year was to suspend the payment of dividends to preserve the 
resources for investment in the business. The dividend policy will be revisited in the future when the business is 
generating sustainable cash earnings and in the context of a prudent capital structure.
   We also embarked on discussions in relation to raising long term debt finance and separately with a global 
strategic partner considering making a minority investment in London Southend Airport and participating in its 
development. These discussions were at an advanced stage when stalled by the onset of the COVID-19 crisis. 
Such opportunities will be revisited as part of a review of a long-term capital strategy for the Group once we have 
returned fully to a normal market situation.
   As a result of these factors we started a process to raise additional funding for the Group which we announced 
today. A combination of additional bank facilities of GBP40m and new equity in excess of GBP80m will allow the 
Group to stabilise its financial position while maintaining its operational capability through the anticipated crisis 
period. This will allow the Group to position the business to focus on our core operations as we get visibility of and 
adapt to the post COVID environment.
   A consequence of the work done in the last six months has led to the conclusion that the Group should focus on 
its Aviation division, being Airports and Aviation Services, and the Energy from Waste logistics business. All other 
non-core businesses or assets will be realised for value over the next three years. In London Southend Airport we 
own and operate a prime London Airport asset with the potential to adapt to passenger demands and grow in a post 
COVID world. The current planning consents for the airport support total passengers of between 7 and 8 million. 
While the timing is uncertain the target of serving 5 million passengers remains an achievable objective.
   The Energy business is a maturing, cash generative and stable business with current capacity to supply 2 million 
tonnes of waste wood per annum. This business is likely to be attractive to strategic partners and infrastructure 
investors and we will look to monetise value for shareholders over the next 18 to 24 months.
   We believe that this new clarity around our future strategy and the medium term move to a pure play airport and 
aviation services business will prove attractive for shareholders.
   Board & People
   While it now seems some time ago, I would like to thank my predecessor Iain Ferguson and Senior Independent 
Director Andrew Wood who both stood down at the AGM in 2019 after a number of years' service. In view of these 
and previous changes to the Board and the clearer focus on the strategic direction, we were at an advanced stage 
Stobart Group Limited Full Year Results -2-
of a process to recruit two additional non-executive directors when we entered lockdown and initiated the 
fundraising process. This recruitment process will now resume and aims to add additional sector specific 
experience to the Board in our core business segments. It will also address the issues of planning for succession, 
improving board diversity and the appointment of a Senior Independent Director. I am also pleased to announce 
that Ginny Pulbrook has become the Board People Engagement representative to reinforce the importance of this 
key stakeholder group and I thank her for taking on this important role.
   The last six months have been a particularly challenging time for the business and my colleagues in every part of 
it. Whether you have been at home on furlough or working in difficult circumstances can I take the opportunity to 
offer my personal thanks to each one of you in the Stobart Community for your dedication and resilience through 
this challenging time.
   Environmental, Social and Governance
   It is important with everything else which has been happening not to lose sight of our ESG responsibilities and the 
importance to all stakeholder groups. The Board is fully committed to its ESG principles which it aims to embed in 
its business as usual activities. During the year we undertook a comprehensive review of our ESG principles and 
put in place a framework for continuous improvement. We report on this in detail in the ESG section of the annual 
report.
   Future
   While it is difficult to look ahead in the middle of a crisis, the work which has been undertaken to focus the Group 
on its core businesses and resolve the legacy issues will offer clarity to shareholders. The fundraising which we 
have announced today will stabilise the business and give us a secure platform to move forward. The Board will 
continue to anticipate and react swiftly to developments in our markets and engage actively with key stakeholders. 
Through this we will seek to position the Group to respond positively to market opportunities as we move from the 
crisis through the recovery phase into the post COVID world.

   The Company has also announced that it has entered into an amended Facility Agreement comprising the 
original GBP80.0 million revolving credit facility under which the Group is fully drawn ("Facility A") and 
a new GBP40.0 million revolving credit facility ("Facility B").   Under Facility B, the Group can draw up 
to GBP10.0 million during the period commencing 5 June 2020 up to and including the date of Admission, 
subject to certain liquidity conditions. Pursuant to the terms of Facility B, the Group will use a portion 
of the proceeds of the Capital Raise (up to GBP10.0 million) to repay the amount drawn under Facility B as 
at the date of Admission within three Business Days of that date. Following such repayment, the Group can 
draw down under Facility B subject to conditions.
   The Board believes the Capital Raising to be in the best interests of Shareholders as a whole and this 
announcement will explain why the Board unanimously recommends that Shareholders should vote in favour of 
the Resolutions, as each Director has committed to do so in respect of his or her own legal and beneficial 
holdings of Shares.
    2.         Background to and reasons for the Capital Raise
   Over the past few years, the Group has been focused on growing its two principal activities to 
reposition it as a high-quality infrastructure business, focused on the aviation and energy-from-waste 
sectors. The Group has been committed to establishing London Southend Airport as a major London airport 
and creating a high-margin renewable waste wood fuel business. Investment in accelerating the growth of 
the Aviation and Energy divisions has been financed through the use of debt facilities, cash resources and 
non-core asset sales.
   Stobart Aviation
   Stobart Aviation owns and operates London Southend Airport and provides management services to the Tees 
Valley Combined Authority in respect of the Teesside International Airport. In addition, Stobart Aviation 
Services, one of the businesses within the division, provides check-in, baggage handling and cargo 
services for 16 airlines at London Stansted, London Southend, Manchester, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports. 
The Group also operates Stobart Jet Centre, which provides services to the private aviation market.
   Stobart Aviation's principal asset is London Southend Airport, which has been rated the best London 
airport in 2019 for the sixth consecutive year in the Which? Airport Passenger Survey and was the United 
Kingdom's fastest growing airport in 2019 according to CAA data. The airport is served by easyJet, Ryanair 
and Wizz Air, amongst others, and in early 2020 served approximately 40 destinations across Europe and the 
United Kingdom.
   London Southend Airport made considerable progress toward its strategic ambitions during FY19/20. 
Passenger numbers increased 43 per cent. to 2.14 million in FY19/20 (FY18/19: 1.49 million). In addition, 
Stobart Group Limited Proposed Placing and Open -4-
in 2019 the Group signed an agreement with a global logistics customer to provide facilities and expertise 
to support the import and export of goods at London Southend Airport.
   Once the unprecedented effects of COVID-19 have subsided, the Directors believe that low-cost
   carriers ("LCCs") will benefit from their lower cost bases and will likely return to normalised 
operations faster than non-LCCs. The Directors believe that LCCs will likely be focused on seeking a low 
cost base for operations and hub capacity at suitable prices and service levels.
   The pace at which this capacity is required will largely depend on the demand from passengers to return 
to international travel, the ability of airlines to react to that demand and the preparedness of airports 
to respond to the changing expectations of passengers and airlines alike. Airports will be expected to 
provide clean, secure and spacious environments in which passengers are not expected to gather in confined 
retail spaces, where cleaners are highly visible and where people can move through central search areas 
efficiently. The Directors believe that London Southend Airport has an opportunity therefore to make use 
of significant unutilised space and enhanced technology, provide a cost-efficient base for airlines given 
the airport's lower capital expenditure to date, and deliver a passenger-focused experience for its 
customers.
   Stobart Energy
   The Directors believe that the Group is the United Kingdom's largest supplier of waste wood fuel to UK 
biomass energy plants, with long-term exclusive contracts in place with some of the largest biomass energy 
plants in the United Kingdom. Bioenergy (including waste wood fuel) is Britain's second largest source of 
renewable electricity (behind wind), generating more than 11 per cent. of the United Kingdom's electricity 
in 2019 (according to UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy statistics).
   As at the date of this announcement, the Group supplies more than 15 large, and a significant number of 
smaller, biomass energy plants in the United Kingdom and Ireland, all of which have successfully completed 
commissioning and are fully operational. With the biomass energy plants operating more consistently as a 
result of completing commissioning, the Group was able to supply 1.5 million tonnes of waste wood fuel in 
FY19/20, representing an increase of 11.5 per cent. on the previous year (FY18/19: 1.3 million).
   Non-core operating divisions
   The Group has three non-core operating divisions: Stobart Rail & Civils, Stobart Investments and 
Stobart Infrastructure. These divisions consist of non-core businesses and assets, and the Group aims to 
divest all of them within the next three years, other than Carlisle Lake District Airport, with an aim of 
realising value over time from a position of strength when market conditions are right.
   Recent Developments
   Whilst the Group's two core operating divisions performed broadly in line with management expectations 
in FY19/20, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the Group's revenue and costs in the first 
three months of FY20/21, in particular in the Stobart Aviation and Stobart Energy operating divisions.
   Stobart Aviation
   Passenger numbers at London Southend Airport fell from approximately 5,500 passengers per day to nearly 
zero over the course of March 2020 and aircraft movements (i.e. landings or take-offs) fell from 
approximately 50 to fewer than 10 per day in the same period. Passenger numbers remain near zero and 
aircraft movements (primarily relating to logistics) remain near 10 as at the date of this announcement, 
and the Group expects this to continue until at least the end of September 2020 (and until the end of 
March 2021 under a 'reasonable worst case scenario'), with a slow recovery until the end of February 2021 
(or until end of June 2021 under a 'reasonable worst case scenario'). This has driven both aeronautical 
and non-aeronautical revenue to virtually zero, with the exception of logistics and some long-term parking 
income. At the same time, the Group has been required to continue to fund its largely fixed cost base in 
regulated areas including security, air traffic control and fire safety to support logistics operations. 
Furthermore, the Stobart Aviation operating division experiences marked seasonality, with most of its 
profits coming from the summer months, which are set to be significantly affected by the COVID-19 
pandemic.
   In addition, on 5 March 2020 Flybe announced it had entered into Administration, and on 10 March 2020 
Flybe's parent company, Connect Airways, also entered into Administration. The Group has a 30 per cent. 
ownership stake in Connect Airways, and Flybe accounted for approximately six per cent. of the passenger 
traffic at London Southend Airport in FY19/20.
   As at the date of this announcement, the operations of London Southend Airport's airline partners are, 
for the most part, still suspended, with airlines taking the opportunity to ground fleets at London 
Southend Airport. Over 15 aircraft are currently parked on the airport's stands, which generates 
approximately GBP5,000 to GBP10,000 per week.
   The airport's global logistics customer, which imports and exports goods to and from the United 
Kingdom, continues to operate as normal. The importance of maintaining the logistics network in the United 
Kingdom means that people working in that operation have been given "key worker" status. Strict safety 
protocols and procedures are in place across the Group's locations in order to protect people still at 
Stobart Group Limited Proposed Placing and Open -4-
work, including aircraft cleaning after every flight and separation of flight and ground crews. The Group 
is also undertaking a variety of pro bono activities to support community groups and furloughed staff.
   Stobart Energy
   Stobart Energy is currently maintaining its operations as biomass energy plants continue to require 
waste wood fuel in order to service the United Kingdom's electricity needs. The importance of supplying 
fuel to support these plants and ensuring the waste supply chain continues to function has meant drivers 
and associated employees have been assigned "key worker" status.
   The key risk to Stobart Energy's ongoing operations is the availability of waste wood. The COVID-19 
pandemic has led to a significant slowdown in construction activity, a 75 per cent. decrease in commercial 
and industrial waste arisings year-on-year and the closure of household waste and recycling centres. 
Without these key sources of supply, the Group's inbound waste wood supply decreased as much as 80 per 
cent. year-on-year, although is starting to recover. The profitability of the Group's production of waste 
wood fuel is, in part, related to the gate fees it charges to third parties for taking waste wood from 
them. The low supply of available waste wood is negatively impacting gate fee pricing and may continue to 
do so for an extended period and may result in an inability of the Group to fulfil its requirements under 
its supply agreements with its biomass energy plant customers.

   These changes, the improvement in income from passengers travelling to the airport, and the wider range of retail 
outlets all helped to increase passenger income. Underlying EBITDA per passenger, a key metric for profitability, 
improved 36.6% to GBP4.33 (2019: GBP3.17). This, combined with the 43.1% increase in passenger numbers, led 
to a 73.8% increase in underlying EBITDA for the Aviation division to GBP8.6m (2019: GBP4.9m). The Aviation 
division however made a total loss before tax of GBP9.8m, with almost all of this loss reflecting new business and 
contract set-up costs.
   Underlying EBITDA in future periods will also benefit from contributions from our global logistics operation. This 
new service, which was announced in October 2019, brings together London Southend Airport's facilities and 
Stobart Aviation Services' expertise to support the import and export of goods.
   That agreement sees London Southend provide airport services, with Stobart Aviation Services using its logistics 
heritage to then move goods to and from our customer's aircraft and through a newly converted warehouse quickly, 
safely and securely.
   Stobart Aviation Services enjoyed progress throughout the year. It now provides airline services across London 
Southend, London Stansted, Manchester, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, working with 16 airlines including 
easyJet, Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), Loganair, Wizz Air, Titan Airlines, Ryanair, Norwegian, Eurowings and SN 
Brussels.
   Both London Southend Airport and Stobart Aviation Services now have great airline partnerships. They deliver a 
first-class customer experience and they have experienced management teams in place. These qualities combined 
mean we are well positioned to play a leading role in the recovery of the aviation sector once the COVID-19 crisis 
passes.
   Operational Review - Stobart Energy
   Stobart Energy continued to make operational progress. This is largely due to the maturing state of the renewable 
energy plants it supplies, which have now successfully completed commissioning and are fully operational.
   With plants now operating more consistently, the volume of waste wood that it was able to supply to plants 
increased to 1.5 million tonnes, representing a 11.5% improvement on the previous year (2019: 1.3 million). Stobart 
Stobart Group Limited Full Year Results -4-
Energy finished the year delivering 33,000 tonnes per week of fuel, equivalent to a run rate of 1.7 million tonnes per 
annum.
   While the majority of the renewable energy plants operated at or above contractual specifications, the plant at 
Tilbury experienced a seven-month unexpected outage caused by a dust explosion. This meant that the plant was 
not in a position to receive its contracted supply of waste fuel, leading to in excess of 100,000 tonnes of raw fuel 
being diverted across the UK, incurring costs. Stobart Energy has protections against loss of revenue and additional 
associated costs through the 'take or pay' provisions of its contract. Finalising the exact amount owed under these 
provisions is ongoing.
   The one plant that did not reach the commissioning phase and therefore qualify for ROC subsidies is Port 
Clarence. Stobart Energy had a contract in place to supply 250,000 tonnes a year to the plant. We secured 
compensation from Port Clarence to reflect the lost revenue associated to that contract.
   Despite the challenges experienced with these two plants, the consistent operation across the majority of plant 
partners, alongside the contractual protections for the Tilbury outage led to a 25.9% increase in underlying EBITDA 
to GBP24.2m (2019 GBP19.2m). We also made a profit before tax of GBP5.2m.
   The division is now well placed to improve its financial performance further with the capital investment phase of its 
development now largely complete. The majority of the infrastructure that Stobart Energy requires to deliver on its 
long-term contracts is now in place. During the year, we completed the development of our Pollington site which 
can store 30,000 tonnes of product. The transport fleet was also renewed with the majority of our 150 vehicles now 
under two years old.
   With that investment in place, the focus now turns to optimising our supply chain and taking more direct control of 
the source of our fuel. Those supply chains are now more robust having recovered from the challenges brought 
about by the delay to commissioning experienced in previous years. As a result, inbound volumes of supply were 
fairly consistent during the year.
   However, the gate fees Stobart Energy is able to charge third parties for taking wood from them was variable and 
reduced significantly from November 2019 to the end of the financial year. We believe this reflects the significant 
increase in demand for waste wood caused by more plants reaching full operations at the same time. This demand 
has now peaked, and we expect gate fees to rise gradually as the market stabilises post-COVID-19.
   The new financial year has brought fresh challenges. While the demand for clean energy continues, the sources 
of wood waste was constricted by the slowdown in construction and the closure of Household Waste and Recycling 
Centres. This situation however has drawn into sharp focus the benefits of supplying diversified waste products.
   Stobart Energy now has the infrastructure in place, a more reliable waste wood supply chain and renewable 
energy plant partners operating more consistently. In the coming periods, Stobart Energy will explore further 
opportunities to utilise its existing infrastructure and supply chain expertise to identify new opportunities alongside a 
strategic partner to support the collection, processing and supply of different sources of waste fuel to new partners.
   On a personal note, I would like to add my thanks to the Stobart Energy team for their dedication and teamwork 
as we navigated the COVID-19 crisis. I am delighted to have joined the Stobart Energy team and excited about 
taking the core business forward and establishing new opportunities over the coming years.
   Operational Review - Non-Strategic Assets
   Stobart Rail & Civils
   Stobart Rail & Civils has been making significant losses in recent years, largely as a result of unprofitable legacy 
contracts. Despite the admirable efforts of the current management team, they have been unable to turn this 
position around. As at 29 February 2020, the existing Rail & Civils contracts were mostly unwound, with only one 
material legacy contract outstanding. This contract relates to the Newton Heath project with Northern Rail, for which 
we have derecognised GBP3.6m of revenue and recognised a GBP0.6m provision in the financial year ending 29 
February 2020.
   COVID-19 has adversely impacted all of the trading divisions in the Group and has exacerbated the loss-making 
position of Rail & Civils. There is no prospect of the business making a profit in the short-term given the impacts of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Given this outlook, the Group needs to ensure cash going forward is utilised to create 
returns for our shareholders. It has therefore taken steps to address the risk of further losses and taken the decision 
to exit the Rail & Civils business by the end of FY21. To that end, the Group is in active dialogue with a number of 
interested parties.
   Non-Strategic Infrastructure
Stobart Group Limited Full Year Results -4-
   Stobart Group owns Carlisle Lake District Airport and a number of brownfield development properties across the 
UK. Stobart Group will realise value from its property assets in the next three years.
   As at 29 February 2020, the book value of Infrastructure assets held is GBP47.3m (2019: GBP82.6m) following 
write downs and disposals.
   Investments - Eddie Stobart Logistics
   Stobart Group is an 11.8% shareholder in Eddie Stobart Logistics, which returned to trading on the London Stock 
Exchange following its suspension.
   On the 20 May 2020, the Group disposed of its Eddie Stobart and Stobart trademarks and designs to Eddie 
Stobart Limited for cash consideration of GBP10.0m. That sale resulted in an immediate cash receipt of GBP6.0m 
with a further GBP2.5m due by December 2020, and the remainder payable in 36 months.
   Stobart Group is proud of the brand it has built over many years. It is an iconic and highly recognisable name, 
associated with great customer service. However, the brand is primarily associated with the highly visible Eddie 
Stobart lorries. This has often created confusion for investors and other stakeholders between the Eddie Stobart 
business and Stobart Group's focus on developing a London airport and its energy business.
   By selling the brand we were able to bring in cash immediately and start to differentiate our businesses, 
establishing a new name that reflects our future. Stobart Group will change its name prior to February 2021, and is 
in the process of identifying a new name. There are a number of Stobart divisions that will continue to use the brand 
for up to 36 months and this will be licensed on a royalty free basis from Eddie Stobart Logistics.
   Investments - Connect Airways
   Connect Airways was made up of a consortium of shareholders encompassing Cyrus Capital (40%), Virgin 
Atlantic (30%) and Stobart Group (30%) that received EU merger clearance to take control of the assets of Flybe 
Limited on 5 July 2019.
   Flybe was a subsidiary of Connect Airways, and we were deeply disappointed to announce on 5 March 2020 that 
the airline ceased trading and was to enter administration. Flybe had shown promising signs of a turnaround 
despite the delay to receiving merger control clearance. However, given the COVID-19 pandemic and despite the 
best efforts of all, the Connect Airways consortium was no longer able to continue fund it.

   Operational excellence
   Wizz Air operates the youngest, most fuel-efficient aircraft among European airlines. The 2020 financial year was 
yet another period of significant investment into our fleet: six A321neos joined the fleet, taking it to 121 aircraft at 
the end of March 2020.

  The new neo aircraft are powered by Pratt & Whitney GTF engines, feature the widest single-aisle cabin with 239 
seats in a single class configuration and deliver close to a 50 per cent reduction in noise footprint compared to 
previous generation aircraft. In addition, Pratt and Whitney's GTF engine reduces fuel burn by 16 per cent and 
nitrogen oxide emissions by 50 per cent.
   We have also placed an order for 20 A321 XLR aircraft during the last year, which brings our total committed 
aircraft order to 268 aircraft to be delivered in the next eight years. Reacting to the current market conditions, we 
also plan to return 32 older leased aircraft in the coming years.
   Today, 47 per cent of the Company's total seat capacity is on A321 family aircraft. Our ultra-efficient fleet will 
ensure that the Company can fulfil its mission to continuously grow our footprint across Central and Eastern Europe 
and beyond, while remaining the ultimate cost-leader in the industry. Based on the current order book with Airbus 
and the aircraft return schedule, the fleet will more than double in size by FY 2025.

  Driving financial performance
   In line with the growth in traffic and capacity, we increased revenues by 19.1 per cent to EUR2,761.3 million and 
report growth in net profit to EUR281.1 million and an underlying profit of EUR344.8 million. We continue to focus 
on strengthening our model of unbundled services and increased our ancillary revenues by 31.5 per cent. At the 
same time, we reduced our ex-fuel unit costs by 0.7 per cent, driven by a relentless focus on our cost base. In the 
current environment, which is characterised by widespread travel restrictions as a result of the coronavirus 
pandemic, our cash balance is the single most important key performance indicator. With our total cash balance of 
EUR1.5 billion, we remain one of the strongest players in the industry and our ultra-low cost base allows us to 
sustain periods of business interruptions significantly longer than other airlines. Subsequent to the annual close for 
F20, we were able to further strengthen our balance sheet in April 2020, when we raised GBP300 million from the 
Bank of England under the UK Government's COVID Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF), which is a clear vote of 
confidence in our business.
   Ultra-low-cost by design
   In the coming year, we will focus on returning to stabilized operations while carefully managing the Company's 
robust balance sheet amidst the coronavirus pandemic. With our ultra-low-cost business model, we have the ability 
to take advantage of opportunities which may arise as a result of competitors withdrawing capacity.
   Our customer base allows us to plan ahead with more certainty than most of our competitors. Most of our 
customers belong to a younger age group with an average age of 36 years and 65% of them travel for work or to be 
reunited with friends and relatives, the most essential reasons to fly. At the same time, we want to ensure 
passengers travel safely with Wizz in this new environment and we are therefore implementing additional health 
and safety measures aimed at minimizing the risk of transmission of the coronavirus on our flights, with an 
emphasis on contactless travel.
   Notwithstanding this challenging environment, Wizz Air is on track to launch its operations in Abu Dhabi, the 
group's first airline established outside of Europe. The airline will initially focus on establishing routes to markets in 
which Wizz Air has existing, high growth operations in Central and Eastern and Western Europe, to be followed in 
due course by routes to the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East and Africa. Wizz Air believes that the 
establishment of a truly ultra-low-cost airline can contribute to the continued growth of Abu Dhabi as a world-class 
cultural and tourist destination.
   With our agile infrastructure across all functions, we can ensure that we remain competitive and continue on our 
growth trajectory as soon as markets normalize. We intend to sustainably grow our business in a scalable way 
while focusing on delivering Shareholder value in an ever-changing market environment.
   Focus on our people

   RYANAIR CALLS ON MRS MERKEL TO SCRAP EUR9BN STATE AID FOR "UNGRATEFUL" LUFTHANSA
   Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Tues 27 May) called on German Chancellor Angela 
Merkel to abandon plans to give EUR9bn of illegal State Aid to the ungrateful Lufthansa. Lufthansa claims 
it needs EUR9bn from the German Govt "as the only viable alternative for maintaining solvency", yet 
Lufthansa refuses to give the German Govt effective Board representation (which would allow Govt Directors 
to participate in Board decisions), and today it also refuses to hand over slots in Frankfurt and Munich, 
which would promote competition and choice to the Lufthansa monopoly in Germany.
   Ryanair today called on Mrs Merkel to scrap this illegal State Aid scheme, which the ungrateful 
Lufthansa has clearly rejected. If the German Govt is serious about restarting air travel to and from 
Germany, then this State Aid should be replaced with a different scheme, which would reduce air travel 
taxes for all airlines operating in Germany for the next 24 months. This would provide Lufthansa, and all 
other airlines in Germany, with transparent supports, which would comply with competition rules, and would 
encourage all airlines in Germany to return to flying and restore the German tourism industry as quickly 
as possible.
   Ryanair's Group CEO Michael O'Leary said:
   "If Lufthansa do not want to hand over slots, or give the German Govt the effective Board 
representation they are entitled to in return for a State subsidy of EUR9bn, then Mrs Merkel should say 
"buzz off" Lufthansa, and instead reduce air travel taxes for all airlines operating in Germany. Lufthansa 
would be the major beneficiary of any such tax reductions, but it would also encourage other airlines, 
including Ryanair, Laudamotion and EasyJet, to return to flying and pass on lower fares to consumers.
   The reduction of these travel taxes to zero for the next 24 months would provide Lufthansa with 
significant funding, but would encourage Lufthansa to return to flying while allowing them to keep their 
precious slots monopoly at Frankfurt and Munich Airports, as well as ignoring the German Govt Board 
membership request.
   Carsten Spohr has played a blinder during the Covid-19 crisis. He is probably the first man in history 
to demand EUR9bn from Mrs Merkel, then tell her to "buzz off" when she wants Board seats and/or slot 
remedies. Not content with demanding money from the German Govt, he is also demanding money from the Swiss

Govt, the Austrian Govt and the Belgian Govt as well. There seems no end to Lufthansa's addiction to State 
Aid, which will distort competition for air travel to and from Germany for many years to come.
   It's time for Mrs Merkel to tell Lufthansa to "buzz off" and bring an end to these illegal State Aid 
demands from the "subsidy junkie" Lufthansa."

   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or

rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).

  Done at London on 26 May 2020
   Notes
   (i) . Persons completing this form should have regard to the requirements of the Transparency (Directive 
2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 as amended (the "Regulations"), the Central Bank of Ireland's Transparency Rules 
(the "Transparency Rules") and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/761 of 17 December 2014.
   (ii) Full name of the legal entity and other identifying specification of the issuer or underlying issuer, provided it is 
reliable and accurate (e.g. address, LEI, domestic number identity).
   (iii) Other reason for the notification could be voluntary notifications, changes of attribution of the nature of the 
holding (e.g. expiring of financial instruments) or acting in concert.
   (iv) This should be the full name of (a) the shareholder; (b) the natural person or legal entity acquiring, disposing 
of or exercising voting rights in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) to 
(h) of Directive 2004/109/EC); or (c) the holder of financial instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the 
Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same or different 
total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) the standard form does not 
provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.

announces that it has allotted a total of 4,979 new ordinary shares of 1 penny each in the capital of the Company 
("Ordinary Shares") following the purchase of 4,979 Ordinary Shares by a number of employees under the 
Company's Share Incentive Plan ("SIP").
   Application has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the 4,979 new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to 
trading on AIM ("Admission") and it is expected that Admission will become effective and trading will commence at 
8.00 a.m. on 29 May 2020.
   After Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue will be 226,583,386 and the total number of voting 
rights will therefore be 226,583,386. This figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the 
calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest 
in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
   This announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014.

   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository receipts 
representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the Regulations and the 
Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding only that the holding is "below 
3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting rights "indirect 
holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and indirect columns - if there is no 
combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.
   (x) Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares ends.
   (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once every 3 months 
starting from [date].
   (xii) In case of cash settled instruments the number and percentages of voting rights is to be presented on a delta-
adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control another undertaking 
then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or legal entity, 
has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed or reached and the 
subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a full picture of the group 
holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are effectively 
held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free 
row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are 
effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or reach the lowest 
applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository receipts 
representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the Regulations and the 
Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding only that the holding is "below 
3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting rights "indirect 
holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and indirect columns - if there is no 
combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.
   (x) Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares ends.
   (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once every 3 months 
starting from [date].
   (xii) In case of cash settled instruments the number and percentages of voting rights is to be presented on a delta-
adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control another undertaking 
then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or legal entity, 
has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed or reached and the 
subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a full picture of the group 
holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are effectively 
held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free 
row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are 
effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or reach the lowest 
applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting rights "indirect 
holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and indirect columns - if there is no 
combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.
   (x) Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares ends.
   (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once every 3 months 
starting from [date].
   (xii) In case of cash settled instruments the number and percentages of voting rights is to be presented on a delta-
adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control another undertaking 
then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or legal entity, 
has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed or reached and the 
subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a full picture of the group 
holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are effectively 
held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free 
row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are 
effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or reach the lowest 
applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   Introduction
   For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") (with the exception of the balance 
sheet commentary below) all figures and comments are by reference to the adjusted results excluding the 
exceptional item referred to below.
   The widespread grounding of aircraft as a result of EU governments reactions to the spread of Covid-19 
means that the Group will operate a significantly reduced flying schedule in FY21 compared to what was 
originally expected.  Therefore, the Group is recording an exceptional hedge ineffectiveness charge of 
EUR392M (net of a tax credit) in relation to FY21 jet fuel hedges.  This is offset by an exceptional gain 
of EUR39M (net of a tax charge) on ineffective currency cashflow hedges for FY21 fuel and delayed capex, 
resulting in a net exceptional charge of EUR353M as at March 31, 2020.
   Income Statement
   Scheduled revenues:
   Scheduled revenues increased by 6% to EUR5,566.2M due to 4% traffic growth (to 149M) and a 2% increase 
in average fares.
   Ancillary revenues:
   Ancillary revenues rose by 20% to EUR2,928.6M due to 4% traffic growth and improved uptake of ancillary 
products, particularly priority boarding and reserved seats.
   Total revenues:
   As a result of the above, total revenues increased by 10% to EUR8,494.8M.
   Operating Expenses:
   Fuel and oil:
   Fuel and oil increased by 14% to EUR2,762.2M due to higher fuel prices and a 6% increase in flight 
hours.
   Airport and handling charges:
   Airport and handling charges increased by 7% to EUR1,140.2M primarily due to a 4% increase in traffic, 
stronger sterling and new enhanced handling arrangements in Stansted, Spain & Poland, which greatly 
improved on time performance.
   Staff costs:
   Staff costs increased 12% to EUR1,106.9M due to 6% more flight hours, increased pilot pay and higher 
crewing ratios as pilot resignations slowed down significantly.
   Route charges:
   Route charges reduced by 1% to EUR736.0M due to a decrease in unit rates offset by a 5% increase in 
sectors.
   Depreciation:
   Depreciation increased 17% to EUR748.7M due to higher capitalised maintenance and the impact of IFRS 16 
(EUR59.3M) which was adopted from April 1, 2019.
   Marketing, distribution and other:
   Marketing, distribution and other increased by 6% to EUR578.8M. Lower customer complaints costs were 
offset by higher distribution and other costs, reflecting the increased activity in the business.
   Maintenance, materials and repairs:
   Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by 34% to EUR256.4M due to higher scheduled engine 
maintenance due to an ageing fleet, 12 operating lease hand backs, Boeing MAX delivery delays and 
provision for 10 additional A320 operating leases.
   Aircraft rentals:
   Aircraft rentals reduced by 54% to EUR38.2M and relates to leases with a duration of less than 12 
months for which the company availed of practical expedients on adoption of IFRS 16 in April 2019. There 
were 12 lease hand backs during the year.
   Unit cost per passenger:
   Unit cost per passenger increased by 6%. Excluding fuel, unit cost per passenger increased by 4%. This 
was primarily due to increased pilot pay and higher crewing ratios, increased ownership costs due to the 
Boeing MAX delivery delays and a 15% reduction in Q4 traffic due to the response of EU Governments to stop 
the spread of the Covid-19 virus. Since mid-March responses included wide spread flight bans and travel 
restrictions which have closed Europe's skies to all but a tiny number of rescue and medical flights.
   Net finance expense:
   Net finance expense decreased by 7% to EUR51.5M as a result of higher interest rates achieved on 
deposits and the re-financing of debt at lower interest rates offset by the effect of IFRS 16 which had a 
negative EUR5.6M impact in the year.
   Balance sheet:
   Gross cash increased by EUR613M to EUR3,808M at March 31, 2020.
   Gross debt increased by EUR567M to EUR4,211M due to a new EUR750M low cost syndicated bank facility and 
the impact of IFRS 16 (EUR246M), offset by EUR419M debt repayments and EUR68M lease liability payments. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -4-
EUR2,106M net cash was generated by operating activities. Net capital expenditure was EUR1,196M and 
shareholder returns amounted to EUR581M.
   Net debt was EUR403M (including EUR246M IFRS 16 lease liability) at year end (March 31, 2019: EUR450M).
   Shareholders' equity:
   Shareholders' equity decreased by EUR247M to EUR4,968M in the year due to IFRS hedge accounting 
treatment for derivatives of EUR332M and EUR581M of shareholder returns offset by consolidated group net 
profit after tax of EUR649M (post net hedge ineffectiveness of EUR353M).

 ----------------  ---------------
  Most of Ryanair's fleet was grounded from mid-March by EU Government flight bans and restrictions.  These 
groundings reduced our March and full year traffic by over 5m guests and cut FY20 profits by over EUR40m.  As 
updated on 1 May, Ryanair expects to operate less than 1% of its scheduled flying programme in Q1 (Apr. to June).  
Some return to flight services is expected in Q2 (July-Sept.) and Ryanair expects to carry no more than 50% of its 
original Q2 traffic target of 44.6m, as bookings will be impacted by public health restrictions (temperature checks 
and face coverings for passengers and staff) and quarantine requirements.  When Group airlines return to 
scheduled flying from July, the competitive landscape in Europe will be distorted by unprecedented quantums of 
State Aid (in breach of EU rules) under which over EUR30bn has been gifted to the Lufthansa Group, Air France-
KLM, Alitalia, SAS and Norwegian among others.  We therefore expect that traffic on reduced flight schedules will 
be subject to significant price discounting, and below cost selling, from these flag carriers with huge State Aid war 
chests.
   BUSINESS REVIEW (FY20):
   Revenues
   Sales grew 10% to EUR8.5bn.  Scheduled Revenue, driven by 4% traffic growth to 149m and 2% higher fares, 
increased by 6% to EUR5.6bn. Covid-19 flight restrictions and aircraft groundings in the 2(nd) half of March 
reduced traffic by over 5m in Q4. Ancillary Revenue rose by 20% to EUR2.9bn as more guests choose Priority 
Boarding and Preferred Seat services. In Oct., Ryanair Labs launched a new digital platform with improved, 
personalised, guest offers. This bedded down well in Q4, prior to Covid-19 groundings, with Labs focusing on 
improved penetration across core ancillary products.
   Costs
   Our fuel bill rose 14% (+EUR335m) to EUR2.8bn due to higher prices and 4% traffic growth. Ex-fuel unit costs 
were adversely impacted by a 48% drop in March traffic (-5.2m guests) due to Covid-19 groundings and, as a 
result, rose by 4% (ahead of the +2% guided).  Higher staff costs (increased pilot pay & higher crew ratios as pilot 
resignations slowed to zero) and maintenance costs (older aircraft longer in the fleet due to the Boeing MAX 
delivery delays) were offset by falling EU261 costs (due to better on-time-performance) and lower route charges. 
The Group has recorded an exceptional EUR353m (net of tax) hedge ineffectiveness charge on FY21 fuel hedges 
(due to Covid-19 groundings), offset by favourable EUR/$ currency hedges for fuel & delayed capex.
   Group Airlines
   During FY20, the Ryanair Group continued to evolve. Buzz increased its fleet to 45 B737s and expanded outside 
Poland with new bases in Prague and Budapest.
   Lauda underperformed in FY20 with fares lower than expected, due to intense price competition from Lufthansa 
subsidiaries in its core Austrian and German markets. FY20 traffic, however, grew to 6.4m at high load factors. In 
April, David O'Brien (former Ryanair CCO) joined the Lauda management team as Joint CEO.  Due to Covid-19 
restrictions, the Lauda fleet has been grounded since 17 March.  With costs running ahead of other Group airlines 
and Lauda's main competitor, Austrian Airlines, expected to receive an EUR800m State Aid bailout, Lauda has had 
to completely rethink its strategy and significantly lower its growth plans.  Its management team are implementing 
restructuring and cost cutting plans and are currently in discussions with its people and its unions in relation to staff 
savings to secure the future of its Vienna A320 base.  Failure to agree meaningful cost reductions on 20 May will 
result in the Vienna A320 base being closed on 30 May with over 300 job losses. Lauda has already abandoned 
plans to operate a base in Zadar for the Ryanair Group.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
   Malta Air, which became the 4(th) Group airline last summer, grew strongly in FY20.  With a fleet of almost 120 
aircraft, it has taken over the Group's French, German, Italian and Maltese bases.  Like Buzz, Lauda and Ryanair 
DAC, it is also reviewing all areas of its cost base so that it remains competitive in its core markets where it will 
compete against government bailed out legacy carriers.
   Ryanair DAC performed well in FY20 and opened new markets in Armenia, Georgia and Lebanon.  Its fleet, 
however, has dropped to 275 B737s as both Buzz and Malta Air took over flight operations for the Group.  
Punctuality improved to over 90% (excl. ATC delays) thanks to Ryanair's investment in new handling arrangements 
in Stansted, Poland and Spain.  In Sept., Eddie Wilson was appointed as Ryanair DAC's CEO.
   Boeing MAX update
   It is over a year since the Group was due to take delivery of its first Boeing 737-MAX-200 aircraft.  Boeing are 
currently guiding a late summer return to service in the US for the B737-MAX.  We believe it will be at least Oct. 
before we receive our first MAX-200 aircraft. We remain fans of, and committed to, these "gamechanger" aircraft 
with 4% more seats & 16% lower fuel burn, which will transform Ryanair's cost base for the next decade. We are 
currently reviewing short-term growth plans and are in active negotiations with both Boeing and Lauda's A320 
lessors to reduce planned deliveries over the next 24 months to reflect slower traffic growth post Covid-19 in 2020 & 
2021.
   Balance Sheet & Liquidity
   Ryanair's balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry with a current cash balance of EUR4.1bn (Ryanair 
recently raised GBP600m under the UK's CCFF) and 330 unencumbered B737s (77% of owned fleet). Since mid-
March, the Group has implemented a series of measures to preserve cash, cut costs, cancel share buybacks and 
defer operating and non-essential capex spending.  As a result, average weekly cash burn has dropped from 
approx. EUR200m in March to just over EUR60m in May.  This liquidity will enable the Group to weather Covid-19 
and emerge stronger when the crisis passes. Our focus will remain on cash preservation/generation and the 
repayment of maturing debt over the next 24 months.
   ESG UPDATE:
   Europe's Greenest, Cleanest Airline
   The future of our planet is of vital importance to our customers and all our people. Ryanair has the lowest carbon 
emissions of any major EU airline at just 66 grams of CO per passenger km. Passengers switching to Ryanair can 
halve their CO emissions compared to other major EU airlines. Ryanair operates the youngest fleet, with the 
highest load factors, and newer more fuel-efficient engines.  During FY20, Ryanair launched a new Environmental 
Policy and appointed a director of sustainability to oversee its implementation.
   Senior Board Changes
   On 1 June Stan McCarty will succeed David Bonderman as Chairman of the Board and Louise Phelan will replace 
Kyran McLaughlin as Senior Independent Director.  Both David and Kyran will step down from the Board on 31 May 
and we thank them both for their long service and wise counsel. Ryanair's new Chairman plans to refresh various 
Board Committees before the Sept. AGM.
   OUTLOOK:
   FY21 will be difficult for the Ryanair Group as its airlines work hard to return to scheduled flying following the 
Covid-19 crisis.  Unlike many flag carrier competitors, Ryanair will not request or receive State Aid. Consultations 
about base closures, pay cuts of up to 20%, unpaid leave and up to 3,000 job cuts (mainly pilots and cabin crew) 
are under way with our people and our unions.  Our Commercial team are also in active discussions with our airport 
partners regarding S.20, and beyond, capacity allocations. Given the uncertainty over the impact and duration of 
the Covid-19 pandemic, coupled with no visibility on what customer behaviour and demand will be following a return 
to service, Ryanair cannot provide FY21 PAT guidance at this time.  The Group expects to record a loss of over 
EUR200m in Q1, with a smaller loss expected in Q2 (peak summer) due to a substantial decline in traffic and 
pricing from Covid-19 groundings.  The Group currently expects to carry less than 80m passengers in FY21 (almost 
50% below its original 154m target).  Ryanair's return to scheduled flying will be rendered significantly more difficult 
by competing with flag carrier airlines who will be financing below cost selling with the benefit of over EUR30bn in 
unlawful State

   The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR7.0M in the year ended March 31, 2020 (March 31, 2019: 
EUR7.7M), is the fair value of options granted in FY20 and prior periods, which is being recognised within 
the income statement in accordance with employee services rendered. During the year ended March 31, 2020 
3.0M ordinary shares were issued at a strike price between EUR6.25 and EUR6.74 per share following the 
exercise of vested mixed options.
    6.            Contingencies
   The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
    7.            Capital commitments
   At March 31, 2020 the Group had an operating fleet of 440 (2019: 455) Boeing 737 aircraft and 26 Airbus 
A320 aircraft (2019: 16).  The Group has agreed to purchase up to 210 (135 firm and 75 options) Boeing 
737-MAX-200 aircraft from the Boeing Corporation over the next four or more years.
    8.            Analysis of operating segment
   The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information provided internally to 
the Group CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).
   Historically, the Group was managed as a single business unit and was reported as a single reportable 
segment. A new group structure was announced in February 2019 and became effective during the current 
financial year, comprising four separate airlines, Ryanair DAC, Buzz, Lauda and Malta Air (established in 
June 2019). Accordingly, in line with the revised management and organisational structures of the 
businesses, the Group changed the basis of segmentation to identify each of the airlines as a separate 
operating segment. Following these changes in the composition of operating segments, segmental reporting 
has been revised as at and for the year ended March 31, 2020, and the comparative disclosures have been 
restated, as required, under IFRS 8.
   The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the profit/(loss) after tax of each airline 
for the reporting period. Resource allocation decisions for all airlines are based on airline performance 
for the relevant period, with the objective in making these resource allocation decisions being to 
optimise consolidated financial results.

   Ryanair DAC is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Lauda, Buzz and Malta Air do not 
exceed the quantitative thresholds for reporting purposes and accordingly have been presented on an 
aggregate basis in the table below.
   There are varying levels of integration between the operating segments. Inter-segment pricing is 
determined on an arm's length basis.

aircraft deposits, spare engines, simulators and heavy maintenance checks.
    11.          Right of use assets & lease liabilities
   The Group has adopted IFRS 16 with effect from April 1, 2019. IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance 
sheet, lease accounting model for lessees.  A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its 
right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease 
payments.

   12.          Assets held for sale
   In August 2019, the Company entered into an agreement to sell 10 Boeing 737-800 aircraft for delivery 
in FY20 and FY21. 3 of these aircraft were sold in the year ended March 31, 2020. The remaining 7 aircraft 
are presented as assets held for sale as at March 31, 2020 and are stated at the lower of their carrying 
amount and fair value less costs to sell.
    13.           Financial instruments and financial risk management
   The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
   These preliminary financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the 2019 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year.
   Fair value hierarchy
   Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
   --    Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that 
the Group can access at the measurement date.
   --    Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that 
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
    --    Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
   Fair value estimation
   Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:

   Except as stated otherwise below, this year's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
   Accounting for assets held for sale
   Non-current assets are classified as held-for sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered 
primarily through sale rather than through continuing use. Such assets are generally measured at the lower 
of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses on initial classification as 
held-for-sale or held-for distribution and subsequent gains and losses on re-measurement are recognised in 
the income statement. Once classified as held-for-sale, intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment are no longer amortised or depreciated, and any equity-accounted investee is no longer equity 
accounted.
   New IFRS standards and amendments adopted during the year
   The following new and amended IFRS standards, amendments and IFRIC interpretations, have been issued by 
the IASB, and have also been endorsed by the EU. These standards are effective for the first time for the 
Group's financial year beginning on April 1, 2019 and therefore have been applied by the Group in these 
condensed consolidated preliminary financial statements:
    --             IFRS 16 - Leases (see below)
    --             Amendments to IFRS 9 - Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation
    --             IFRIC 23 - Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
    --             Amendments to IAS 28 - Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures
    --             Amendments to IAS 19 - Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement
    --             Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015 - 2017 Cycle - various standards
   With the exception of IFRS 16, the adoption of these new or amended standards did not have a material 
impact on the Group's financial position or results from operations in the year ended March 31, 2020. The 
impact of adoption of IFRS 16 is set out below.
   IFRS 16 - Leases
   The Group has adopted IFRS 16 with effect from April 1, 2019.  IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance 
sheet, lease accounting model for lessees.  A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its 
right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease 
payments.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -5-
   The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach, under which the cumulative 
effect of initial application is recognised in retained earnings at April 1, 2019.  Accordingly, the 
comparative information presented for FY19 has not been restated - i.e. it is presented, as previously 
reported, under IAS 17 and related interpretations.  The details of the changes in accounting policies are 
disclosed below.
   As a lessee, the Group previously classified leases as operating or finance leases based on its 
assessment of whether the lease transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.  
Under IFRS 16, the Group recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases i.e. these 
leases are on-balance sheet.
   The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for some leases of 
low-value assets and has applied the exemption not to recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for 
leases with terms less than 12 months.
   The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.  The 
right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the lease liability.   The 
lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the 
commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be 
readily determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental 
borrowing rate as the discount rate.
   The Group has determined the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a lessee that include 
renewal options.  The assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise such options 
impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use 
assets recognised. As at March 31, 2020, the Group's right-of-use assets relate to leased aircraft.
   The impact of the IFRS 16 transition increased non-current assets on April 1, 2019 by EUR130.7M, 
increased liabilities by EUR140.4M and reduced equity (distributable reserves) by EUR9.7M.
   When measuring lease liabilities for leases that were previously classified as operating leases, the 
Group has discounted lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate at April 1, 2019, the rates 
ranged from between 2.5% and 3.0%.
   During the year ended March 31, 2020 non-current assets increased by EUR106.1M (net) and liabilities 
increased by EUR105.5M (net) due to the addition of 18 leased aircraft to the fleet.
   The Group has recognised depreciation and interest expenses instead of operating lease expenses in 
relation to those leases under IFRS 16. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Group recognised 
EUR61.7M of depreciation expense and EUR5.6M of lease interest expenses from these leases in the condensed 
consolidated preliminary income statement.
   New IFRS standards and amendments issued but not yet effective
   The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for the purposes 
of the preparation of future financial statements, where applicable.  While under review, we do not 
anticipate that the adoption of the other new or revised standards and interpretations will have a 
material impact on our financial position or results from operations:
   --    Amendments to References to Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards (effective for fiscal periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2020)
   --    Amendments to IFRS 3 - Definition of a Business (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after January 1, 2020)
   --    Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 - Definition of Material (effective for fiscal periods beginning on 
or after January 1, 2020)
   --    IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 
2023)*
   --    Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7) (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020)
   --    Classification of liabilities as current or non-current (Amendments to IAS 1) (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023)*
   *These standards or amendments to standards are not as yet EU endorsed
    2.            Judgements and estimates
   The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
   In preparing these condensed consolidated preliminary financial statements, the significant judgements 
made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies have been re-evaluated in light of Covid-
19. The key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the most recent 
published consolidated financial statements, together with the addition of the determination of 
effectiveness of the Group's cashflow hedges.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -5-
   Specifically, due to flight cancellations and expected reduced capacity as a result of the impact of 
Covid-19, a loss of EUR407M has been charged to the income statement as an exceptional operating cost due 
to the discontinuation of hedge accounting for jet fuel and foreign exchange forward contracts related to 
fuel and delayed capital expenditure.  In accounting for forward contracts that are still expected to 
occur, Ryanair must make estimates at March 31, 2020 about whether the volumes of jet fuel hedged are 
still expected to be matched with future jet fuel consumption coupled with the timing of cashflow 
obligations for certain capital expenditure and, therefore, remain highly probable forecast transactions 
for which the fair value gains or losses on the forward contracts can be recognised in other comprehensive 
income.  These assumptions relate to the timing of the removal of flight restrictions imposed by 
governments and the impact of Covid-19 on passenger demand, which ultimately impact forecast fuel 
consumption and certain capital expenditure.  Minor changes to those assumptions could have a significant 
effect on the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
    3.            Seasonality of operations
   The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue. Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Accordingly, 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
    4.            Income tax expense
   The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the year ended March 31, 2020 
was 3% (March 31, 2019: 6.7%). The tax charge for the year ended March 31, 2020 of EUR21.6M (March 31, 
2019: EUR63.1M) comprises a current tax charge of EUR44.4M, a deferred tax charge of EUR22.8M primarily 
relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment and net operating losses.

   --          Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to 
determine the fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
   --          Derivatives - currency forwards and aircraft fuel contracts: A comparison of the contracted 
rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at March 31, 2020 has been used to 
establish fair value. (Level 2)
   The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the year ended March 31, 2020, there 
were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
   Financial instruments not measured at fair value
   --          Long-term debt: The repayments which the Group is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at March 31, 2020 to arrive at 
a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
   There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the year ended March 
31, 2020 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.
    13.           Financial instruments and financial risk management (continued)
   The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated balance sheet, are as follows:

    14.          Shareholder returns
   In the year ended March 31, 2020 the Company bought back 47.2M ordinary shares at a total cost of 
EUR581M.  This buy-back was equivalent to approximately 4.2% of the Company's issued share capital at 
March 31, 2019.  All of these ordinary shares repurchased were cancelled at March 31, 2020.
   In FY19 the Company bought back 37.8M shares at a total cost of EUR561M. This buy-back was equivalent 
to approximately 3.2% of the Company's issued share capital at March 31, 2019.  All of these repurchased 
ordinary shares were cancelled at March 31, 2019.
   As a result of the share buybacks in the year ended March 31, 2020, share capital decreased by 47.2M 
ordinary shares (37.8M ordinary shares in the year ended March 31, 2019) with a nominal value of EUR581M 
(EUR561M in the year ended March 31, 2019) and the other undenominated capital reserve increased by a 
corresponding EUR0.3M (EUR0.2M in the year ended March 31, 2019). The other undenominated capital reserve 
is required to be created under Irish law to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.

Body
   In the September 2019 Aurora factsheet, we introduced the new holding as follows: Ryanair is "Europe's biggest 
airline measured by passenger numbers, and it is the low-cost producer everywhere that it competes. It is, like 
easyJet, a product of an inspiration from Herb Kelleher, founder and creator of Southwest Airlines, who sadly died 
earlier this year. He was to aviation what Sam Walton was to retail. Michael O'Leary said of him, "Herb was the 
Grand Master Yoda of the low-fare airlines. He was the leader, the visionary and the teacher: without Herb there 
would be no Ryanair, and no low fares airlines anywhere."
   Michael O'Leary, an accountant from KPMG, joined Ryanair owner Tony Ryan of GPA as a personal tax advisor 
but in 1987, then 26 years old, he was sent to Dallas to meet Herb Kelleher and learn about the Southwest Airlines 
model. He eventually joined Ryanair in 1991 and became CEO in 1994. What he joined was a small loss-making 
airline in need of a new approach and his epiphany in Dallas gave him the strategy that he believed would work well 
in Europe.
   Like the easyJet founder he didn't adopt the Southwest model lock, stock and barrel. He took a quite different 
approach to customers and staff. Recently, he realised the positive returns from treating customers well, largely 
through seeing the very different policies in effect at easyJet. There are also signs of a changing attitude to staff, 
which he describes as a liability or cost rather than an asset.
   But what he did worked. He started in 1991 with an airline carrying 0.7 million passengers and needing a GBP20 
million injection to cover losses. In 2019 it carried approximately 142 million passengers (200 times more). He has 
done that without ever suffering an operating loss in a year and whilst earning an average of 20% per annum on his 
shareholders equity. He is a master of great capital allocation, both in deploying it and in buying back equity when it 
is attractive. Since the credit crunch he has handed back close to 7 billion euros to shareholders in the form of 
buybacks and special dividends.
   As we have commented previously with easyJet, there is an intense competitive battle going on in European 
aviation as a result of more planes than customers. Ryanair and easyJet are filling their planes at prices that whilst 
still profitable for them is driving others to losses and some out of business. Thomas Cook was just the latest in a 
long line of casualties. The ability to buy such a great business at a low multiple to cyclically depressed earnings is 
Aurora Investment Trust PLC Annual Financial -4-
likely to result in great long-term returns. Ryanair either reinvests profits in the business at a 20% return or hands 
them back to shareholders.
   We have been buying at prices equivalent to 9 to 10 euros per share when we estimate central intrinsic value 
before buybacks at c.21 euros. As its market continues to expand and its competition reduce, we expect it to 
continue to be able to grow for some time and in Michael O'Leary we have someone who we are happy to have our 
capital managed by.
   The window of opportunity which allowed us to purchase Ryanair at the price we wanted to pay also allowed us to 
significantly add to our holding in easyJet in late May/early June. The opportunity arose due to a combination of 
factors; The competitive climate in airline travel manifested itself in lower ticket prices and therefore lower 
profitability. A contributing factor to this was overcapacity as weaker carriers survived winter 2018/19, helped by low 
fuel prices. easyJet continued to be buffeted (in share price terms) by Brexit and finally its exit from the FTSE100 
resulted in significant index fund selling. In combination these factors resulted in share price falls of circa 40% from 
the summer of 2018 when it was trading above GBP15. We added to the holding at share prices around GBP9.
   Despite the noise and uncertainty from the factors above, our long-term core thesis for easyJet remains the same: 
we see a strong business with valuable take-off and landing slots; low costs compared to the flag carriers it rubs 
against on these slot constrained routes; and a solid balance sheet. We remain comfortable that after the industry 
consolidates, easyJet along with Ryanair will be among the strong operators left standing.
   The activity referred to above occurred before the present COVID-19 situation and its potential effects on the 
airline industry. Its long-term implications are as yet unknown but the stress tests we have undertaken give us 
confidence that both easyJet and Ryanair have the financial resources to weather the crisis.
   In the Autumn of 2019, we exited our supermarket holdings, Tesco and Morrisons. One of the key pillars of our 
investment premise was that the food retail market is not properly competitive, that food shopping choice is mainly 
geographic, and the planning system creates huge barriers to entry. The rise of the German discounters and of 
online shopping has not really changed that. Both companies were able to repair their damaged position with 
customers and restore their businesses to growth and improved profitability.
   However, we detected a potential change in consumption habits that concerned us and, in the end, undermined 
our confidence in our ability to estimate the long-term economics of these businesses. That change is the rise of 
home delivered food, which we believe has changed from being the move online of what was already the traditional 
restaurant takeaway business, into a substitute for what would have been a food shop at the grocers. The industry 
is still in its infancy, but already it is having profound impacts on shopping habits. What is currently mainly a delivery 
of a meal is also becoming the delivery of groceries at very short notice.
   One of the biggest long-term trends in the UK grocery market has been the shift towards convenience shopping 
and more frequent smaller shops.  The offering of this service now by Deliveroo, Amazon and others is likely to take 
business away from the main grocers and, at a minimum, change the economics of the industry. Tesco and 
Morrisons are both very well managed businesses and have to work extremely hard to deliver just modest growth, 
but this we fear has the potential to reverse that.
   That change in our assessment of the way the UK grocery market will evolve, along with a loss of confidence in 
our ability to forecast it, resulted in the exit from both holdings.
   Following share price weakness which related to issues with their auditor and a potential tax bill in Belgium, we 
took the opportunity to add 1.5% to the holding in Frasers Group (Sports Direct). Gary Channon wrote to Aurora 
investors in the July factsheet to explain our thoughts on the company and that is outlined below:
   "Sports Direct has been in the news a lot lately. Firstly, they delayed the announcement of their results saying 
they weren't ready. When they were ready, there was a further delay on the day because of the apparently 
unexpected receipt of a large tax demand from the Belgian tax authorities the day before. Slightly lost in all the 
headlines was that the financial results were very resilient, outperforming most UK retailers and although House of 
Fraser was loss making, it wasn't any worse than expected.
   When we are considering our investments, and this is especially the case with Sports Direct, we need to 
distinguish between information that matters, i.e. that tells us something significant, and that which doesn't. Despite 
all the hullabaloo about these goings on, in our opinion most of it tells us very little that matters. We've found 
nothing that goes to integrity or even corporate governance.  This isn't intended as a rebuttal piece, it would be too 
long if we went through every twist and turn and our evidence, deductions and interpretations, I just want to say that 
from our perspective, as investors who have followed Sports Direct very closely for a decade, that we have found 
nothing that isn't consistent with either their explanation of it, or their way of operating. In the manner of Occam's 
Aurora Investment Trust PLC Annual Financial -4-
Razor, the simplest explanation is usually the correct one, so we believe the results were late because the Sports 
Direct audit is incredibly complicated this year due to all of the acquisitions, and its auditor, who is under enormous 
pressure to improve its audits, was unable to meet the deadline despite putting three times as many staff on the 
audit as last year. The actual results day was impacted by the receipt of a demand from the Belgian authorities the 
day before. That's it and we believe these facts are not symptomatic of some wider malaise or failing.
   We have watched entrepreneurs like Ken Morrison, push their organisations hard when there is a big opportunity. 
In his case buying Safeway. They focus on what matters, on seizing the opportunity, on creating the most future 
value and they don't pay much attention to the short-term optics or the desire to have everything looking smooth 
and under control. When you do this in the public domain as a listed company you may suffer bad headlines and a 
volatile share price. For the investor who separates out what matters and is able to judge value, then these times 
often present opportunities.

  Analysis by Type, Market and Currency
   All investments except Phoenix SG, are of ordinary shares, denominated in sterling or converted to sterling using 
the prevailing exchange rate at the time of valuation. All holdings carried at a value are in listed companies with the 
exception of Hornby and Randall & Quilter, which are quoted on AIM, and Phoenix SG which is unquoted (although 
part of its assets relate to AIM quoted shares in Stanley Gibbons plc).
   The Company also has holdings in China Chaintek and Naibu Global International, which have been written down 
to a valuation of GBPnil (2018: GBPnil).
   All active holdings in the Company's portfolio are UK companies, with the exception of Ryanair (Irish).
   Statement from the CIO of the Investment Manager
   As satisfying as last year was, what is of more interest and importance is the current COVID-19 pandemic. As we 
write, the pandemic is still prevailing, and markets have crashed and then partially rebounded. Let me briefly outline 
how we approach a situation like this and what you might expect to come from it.
   At the very outset back in January, we considered whether our businesses were at risk of ruin if the virus in China 
ended up being a global pandemic with a shutdown of the economy. We also asked whether our businesses will be 
weakened competitively by it or strengthened. Our assessment then was that our businesses are all robust enough 
in their financing that they will be here on the other side and their competitive positions will either be the same or 
better after. Now we are in the reality of the lockdown and we have had the chance to see the impact and speak to 
our managements, we still believe those assessments are correct.
   That is not to say that the economic shutdown does not do damage - it does. Our holdings in easyJet, Ryanair, JD 
Wetherspoon and Frasers in particular will suffer big losses this year from the ceasing of activity. When we apply 
that to the overall portfolio, that damage is around 13% of our starting estimate of Intrinsic Value. This is bad but not 
disastrous. In the meantime, the portfolio price has dropped by 40%.
   We have used the drop in share prices to invest the cash in the portfolio at very attractive levels. We have looked 
to purchase at one-third of intrinsic value (i.e. with 200% of upside) even adjusted for the impact of COVID-19. As 
we do this, we add considerable future value, and if we are to do our job well, then we have used the opportunity 
presented by COVID-19 to build the next leg of our performance. As we have a long history of doing so at Phoenix, 
downturns are when we do our best work, create the most value whilst reporting negative numbers and then later, 
provided our investment judgements were correct, we deliver excellent returns whilst seeming to do very little.
   COVID-19 is a very unusual type of downturn, but investment-wise, carries all the familiar hallmarks to others in 
that there is a sudden overreaction to bad news, which of its nature, will mean that it is time limited. A rush for 
safety and liquidity causes equity prices to plummet and those falls beget more fear and more selling to a point 
where the price move is out of proportion to the negative news.
   We will stick to what we know, avoid using leverage, invest in long-term winners run by honest and competent 
managers and then let time do its bit. When I write this report next year, this crisis is likely to have passed and you 
will be able to judge the wisdom and value of our actions. However, as of now, the Company has not represented 
better value since we started managing it.
   Subsequent to the year end, we have started a process which you will hear about in the near future, to organise 
our activities in companies we control and influence into a single company rather than as separate holdings in our 
funds.  We believe we are adding value in those activities but it is probably not clear to our investors and so by 
putting that activity into a single investment vehicle and listing it on the London Stock Exchange we create 
transparency. That listed holding will be subject to the same limits as all of our other listed investments in the 
Company. We will also remove the current rule that allows up to 10% of the Company to be invested in private 
companies and make that zero.
Aurora Investment Trust PLC Annual Financial -3-
   We will be writing to you about it in the near future with a lot more detail and information and asking for you to 
vote on it at a Shareholder meeting where I will come and be ready to answer your questions about it. The 
attraction of the new structure is that should we, the board or you in the future decide that we do not want that part 
of what Phoenix does in the portfolio, then it can be sold.
   More positively, we think that part of the portfolio represents the very best value and opportunity, increased by 
what is going on right now in the world, and therefore ultimately could be the best performing part of the Company.

   Investment Management Review and Outlook
   During the year, the NAV per Ordinary Share increased by 29.9% and the Ordinary Share price by 32.0%. As of 
31 December 2019, the Ordinary Shares were trading at a 2.1% premium and had traded at a small premium for 
the majority of the year to 31 December 2019. The FTSE All-Share rose by 19.1% over the same period.
   Since Phoenix began managing the Company on 28 January 2016 until 31 December 2019, its NAV per Ordinary 
Share has risen 55.9% versus 49.1% for the FTSE All-Share Index. This has resulted in a performance fee being 
earned. Phoenix has taken the initial 80% of this fee in Ordinary Shares of the Company, with the remaining 20% to 
be issued after the Company's full results have been announced.  Phoenix must keep those Ordinary Shares for a 
minimum period of 3 years. If the outperformance over the benchmark has disappeared at the third-year 
anniversary the Ordinary Shares will be forfeited, and Phoenix will receive nothing. This we believe is one of the 
most aligned fee structures in the industry.
   A total of 11.1 million new Ordinary Shares worth GBP22.4 million were issued in the year. Net assets at 31 
December 2019 were GBP154.3 million (2018: GBP101.0 million) as the Phoenix investment approach continued to 
attract new Shareholders to the Company.
   As we write at the end of March it is clear the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is significant, and the portfolio 
and the overall market have suffered heavy declines. As at 31 March 2020, the Company's Ordinary Share price is 
down 36.9% for 2020 with the FTSE All-Share down 25.1%. In the Statement from the CIO report, Gary Channon 
outlines the work that has been undertaken to stress test the impact of this pandemic on the businesses we own 
and our confidence in their ability to survive. He outlines our view that our holdings have the financial robustness to 
ensure their competitive strengths remain intact through this crisis.
   Activity Review
   2019 saw one new holding, Ryanair, added to the portfolio. This investment leveraged off the knowledge built up 
through our holding in easyJet. We have previously discussed the background of the European low-cost airline 
industry from an easyJet perspective and those basic forces of demographic demand are the same for Ryanair, but 
it operates in a different space within that market as their route overlap is very low. Where they do go head to head, 
Ryanair operates at a slightly lower cost and easyJet earns a higher price on its tickets resulting in similar returns. 
Ryanair does not have a big presence in the main slot constrained European airports like easyJet does.

   We were buyers of Morrisons at that time when they told the City they couldn't produce figures and we 
were recent buyers of Sports Direct when they initially plunged on the latest news. These situations do 
look ugly and they don't help with the short-term perception of Aurora, but we believe that in reality it 
is an opportunity, and that in time that will be borne out and our investors will prosper as a result. The 
shareholders of Debenhams, judged by the feedback given on corporate governance and how they voted at 
AGMs, were happy with the stewardship of the company and yet that board wiped out the shareholders and 
handed it to the buyers of its debt, even when there was an offer to underwrite a rights issue to rescue 
some value for shareholders. Somehow, Mike Ashley is the villain in that saga, and he is the one in need 
of better corporate governance despite his stewardship of Sports Direct, which has seen it generate strong 
profits in the business its shareholders own.
   The key point I would like to make about Sports Direct is that our estimation of its value has not 
changed negatively in the past few months. We are always happy to acknowledge when that does happen, and 
it happens a lot, but not here."
   Frasers Group (Sports Direct) ended the year as the best performing holding in the portfolio posting a 
rise of 92.8%. The company rallied strongly in the final quarter as the market as whole rose in 
anticipation of a Conservative government and the company itself reported good results in December. In 
that announcement they outlined they had come to an agreement with the Belgium tax authorities that a 
significant proportion of the tax bill was not valid, and that PwC Belgium had independently found no 
evidence of material underpayments of VAT.
   From a share price perspective, as well as the strong move from Frasers Group (Sports Direct), other 
holdings showing significant price increases of above 20% included the housebuilders with Barratt 
Developments +74%, Redrow +59% and Bellway +59%. JD Wetherspoons rose 51% during the year along with 
easyJet +35%, Lloyds Banking Group +28%, GlaxoSmithKline +25% and Ryanair +23%. Two fallers of note during 
the year were Dignity -14% and Phoenix SG -8%. Our view of the long-term value of Dignity has not changed, 
especially if it pursues the sort of price and service leadership strategy that we think makes sense.
   In March 2020, as a consequence of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the CMA announced that 
publication of their review into the funeral home and crematoria sector would be delayed until March 2021.
   Phoenix SG , the investment vehicle which houses the assets related to our investment in Stanley 
Gibbons PLC reduced in value by approximately 8% during the year. The share price of Stanley Gibbons PLC 
was basically unchanged over the year and progress was made in selling the stamp inventory. Our estimate 
of the value of the receivable from the Guernsey administration process was reduced due to increased 
spending by the administrator. However, we did receive an in-specie distribution from the administration 
Aurora Investment Trust PLC Annual Financial -5-
in the form of more stamps and collectibles which we have agreed to sell via Stanley Gibbons. A further, 
likely small, cash distribution from this process can be expected.
   The business has become cleaner and leaner in 2019 with costs decreasing and underlying revenue 
increasing. The core building blocks of future growth consistent with the investment rationale are well on 
the way to being in place and we expect this to allow for further growth in the future.

   Other Strategic Report Information
   Principal risks and uncertainties
   The procedures in place to identify emerging or principal risks are described below.
   The Audit Committee regularly reviews the Company's risk matrix, focusing on ensuring that the 
appropriate controls are in place to mitigate each risk. Emerging risks are reviewed regularly to ensure 
that risks are identified and managed so far as practicable. The experience and knowledge of the Audit 
Committee and Board is invaluable to these discussions, as is advice received from the Board's service 
providers, specifically the Investment Manager who is responsible for all portfolio management services.
   The market and operational risks and financial impact as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 
measures introduced to combat its spread, were discussed by the Board, with updates on operational 
resilience received from the Investment Manager, Administrator and other key service providers.
   The following is a description of the role each service provider plays in the identification of 
emerging risks.
   1.   Investment Manager: the Investment Manager advises the Board at each meeting on world markets, 
stock market trends, information on stock specific matters as well as regulatory, political and economic 
changes likely to impact the Company's portfolio;
   2.   Distributor and Broker: provides advice periodically specific to the Company on the Company's 
share register, sector, competitors and the investment company market;
   3.   Company secretary and auditor: briefs the Board on forthcoming legislation/regulatory change that 
might impact on the Company.  The auditor also has specific briefings at least annually;
   4.   AIC: The Company is a member of the AIC, which provides regular technical updates as well as 
drawing members' attention to forthcoming industry and regulatory issues.
   Procedure for oversight
   Audit and Risk Committee: Minimum twice yearly review of the Risk Matrix and formal (at least annual) 
review of the risk procedures and controls in place at the key service providers to ensure that emerging 
(as well as known) risks are adequately identified and - so far as practicable - mitigated.
   Experienced NEDs on the Committee, each bringing external knowledge of the investment trust (and 
financial services generally) marketplace, trends, threats etc. as well as macro/strategic insight.
   The principal risks faced by the Company, together with the approach taken by the Board towards them, 
have been summarised below.
   Portfolio Risk
   Changes in general economic and market conditions including, for example, interest rates, cost 
increase, rates of inflation, industry conditions, competition, political events and trends, tax laws, 
national and international conflicts and other factors, particularly noting the recent outbreak of COVID-
19 and the impact to the economy, could substantially and adversely affect the Company's prospects.
   --    Poor stock selection or poor use of gearing, resulting in underperformance against the Company's 
benchmark.
    --    Poor use of gearing, creating a drag on performance during times of market declines.
    --    Illiquid stock creating a drag on performance.
   --    Poor governance, compliance or administration, including particularly the risk of loss of 
investment trust status.
   Management of risks
   The Board undertakes a review of the performance of the Company and scrutinises and challenges notable 
transactions at each quarterly Board meeting.  At least on an annual basis the Remuneration and Management 
Engagement Committee review the engagement of the Investment Manager, including the Investment Manager's 
achievements with regard to the Company's performance. The performance of service providers is reviewed 
annually via its Remuneration and Management Engagement Committee. Each service provider's Contract 
defines the duties and responsibilities of each and has safeguards in place including provisions for the 
termination of the agreement.
   Risk diversification
   The Company invests in organisations normally listed and traded on the London Stock Exchange, and by 
spreading its investments across a range of such securities. At 31 December 2019, the Company held 17 
(2018: 18) stocks, spread across 7 (2018: 7) main sectors.
Aurora Investment Trust PLC Annual Financial -5-
   Gearing
   The Company has the power under its Articles to borrow money. The Company does not currently intend to 
use gearing. However, if the Board did decide to utilise gearing the aggregate borrowings of the Company 
would be restricted to 30% of the aggregate of the paid-up nominal capital plus the capital and revenue 
reserves.
   The Board will keep under review whether any provision should be made for the use of short-term 
borrowing for the sole purpose of meeting working capital requirements from time-to-time. Further details 
concerning currency risks, liquidity risks and interest rate risks are given in note 16.
   Liquidity
   The Board undertakes a review of the liquidity of the investments at each quarterly Board meeting and 
takes appropriate action where deemed necessary.
   Viability Statement
   A resolution was unanimously approved for the continuation of the Company as an investment trust at the 
2019 AGM. The continuation vote will be put to Shareholders at every third AGM.  The next continuation 
vote will be held at the 2022 AGM. Investors have given no indication that they would oppose the 
continuation of the Company when the continuation vote is next presented to Shareholders.
   The Directors have considered the viability of the Company over a five year period to 31 December 2024, 
which they believe is an appropriate period over which to assess the Company given the Company's long-term 
investment strategy and the principal and emerging risks and uncertainties.
   After making inquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence and meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least five 
years from the date of approval of this report.

   RYANAIR TO RESTORE 40% OF SCHEDULED FLIGHTS FROM 1 JULY
   CREW & PASSENGERS TO WEAR FACE MASKS & PASS TEMPERATURE CHECKS
   Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Tues 12(th) May) announced plans to return to 40% 
of normal flight schedules from Wed 1 July 2020, subject to Government restrictions on intra-EU flights 
being lifted, and effective public health measures being put in place at airports. Ryanair will operate a 
daily flight schedule of almost 1,000 flights, restoring 90% of its pre-Covid-19 route network. Full 
details of these routes, frequencies, flight times, and promotional prices are available on 
www.Ryanair.com
   Since the Covid-19 flight restrictions in mid-March, Ryanair has been operating a skeleton daily 
schedule of 30 flights between Ireland, the UK and Europe. From July, Ryanair will restart flying from 
most of its 80 bases across Europe. There will be fewer daily/weekly frequencies on trunk routes, as 
Ryanair works to restore some services on the widest number of routes, rather than operating high 
frequency services on a small number.
   Ryanair also released a return to flying video, ( click here ) or visit the            www.Ryanair.com  
homepage, encouraging passengers to observe effective health measures to limit the Covid-19 virus. These 
include fewer checked bags, check in online, downloading boarding pass to the passenger smart phone, as 
well as undergoing temperature checks at airport entry and wearing face masks/coverings at all times in 
the terminal and on board aircraft. All Ryanair aircraft are fitted with HEPA air filters (similar to 
those used in critical hospital wards) and all aircraft interior surfaces are disinfected every night with 
chemicals, which are effective for over 24 hours. While temperature checks and face masks/coverings are 
the cornerstone of this healthy return to service, social distancing at airports and onboard aircraft will 
be encouraged where it is possible.
   On board its aircraft, Ryanair cabin crew will wear face masks/coverings and a limited inflight service 
will be offered of pre-packaged snacks and drinks, but no cash sales. All onboard transactions will be 
cashless. Queuing for toilets will also be prohibited on board although toilet access will be made 
available to individual passengers upon request. Ryanair encourages passengers to regularly hand wash and 
use hand sanitizers in airport terminals.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR TO RESTORE 40% OF FLIGHTS FROM 1 JULY
   As a temporary further public health measure, while EU States emerge from their respective Covid-19 
lockdowns, Ryanair will require all passengers flying in July & Aug to fill in details (at the point of 
check in) of how long their planned visit will be, and also their address while visiting another EU 
country, and this contact information will be provided to EU Governments to help them to monitor any 
isolation regulations they require of visitors on intra-EU flights.
   Ryanair's CEO Eddie Wilson said:
   "It is important for our customers and our people that we return to some normal schedules from 1 July 
onwards. Governments around Europe have implemented a 4 month lockdown to limit the spread of the Covid-19 
virus. After 4 months, it is time to get Europe flying again  so we can reunite friends and families, 
allow people to return to work, and restart Europe's tourism industry, which provides so many millions of 
jobs.
   Ryanair will work closely with public health authorities to ensure that these flights comply, where 
possible, with effective measures to limit the spread of Covid-19. As already shown in Asia, temperature 
checks and face masks/coverings are the most effective way to achieve this on short haul (1 hour) within 
Europe's single market.
   Now that Europe's States are allowing some gradual return to normal life, we expect this will evolve 
over the coming weeks and months. With more than 6 weeks to go to 1(st) July, Ryanair believes this is the 
most practical date to resume normal flight schedules, so that we can allow friends and families to 
reunite, commuters to go back to work, and allow those tourism based economies such as Spain, Portugal, 
Italy, Greece, France and others, to recover what is left of this year's tourism season.
   Seats on all these flights are now on sale at            www.Ryanair.com from 1 July, at prices which 
start from just EUR19.99 one way. We will continue to work closely with public health agencies to 
encourage our people and passengers to adopt practical and effective steps to limit the spread of Covid-19 
virus, in the best interest of our passengers, our people and our communities".

   Ryanair Holdings PLC
   01 May 2020
   RYANAIR HOLDINGS PLC - COVID-19 MARKET UPDATE
   Ryanair Holdings Plc today Fri. 1 May updated the market on its traffic projections for Q1, its plans for a likely 
return to services in Q2, the expected significant decline in current year traffic, and the impact on fares in Europe 
where the level playing field will be distorted by competing against legacy airlines who are receiving over EUR30 
billion of State Aid, in clear breach of both EU competition and State Aid rules. This unlawful and discriminatory 
State Aid will be challenged by Ryanair in the European Courts.
   Q1 and full year traffic outlook
   Due to Continent wide EU Government flight restrictions, Ryanair expects to operate less than 1% of its 
scheduled flying program in Apr, May & June 2020. Q1 traffic of less than 150,000 passengers will be 99.5% behind 
the Q1 budget of 42.4m passengers. While some return to flight services is expected in the second (July-Sept) 
quarter, Ryanair expects to carry no more than 50% of its original traffic target of 44.6m in Q2. For the full year 
ended March 2021, Ryanair now expects to carry less than 100m passengers, more than 35% below its original 
154m target.
   State Aid Distorts Competitive Landscape
   When scheduled flights return in Europe, sometime in July, Ryanair believes it will take some time for passenger 
volumes to return. Consumer confidence will be impacted by public health restrictions, such as temperature checks 
at airports and face coverings for passengers and staff on board aircraft. Ryanair expects traffic on reduced flight 
schedules will be stimulated by significant price discounting, and below cost selling from flag carriers with huge 
State Aid war chests (or nationalisation in the case of Alitalia). These lower fares will require aggressive airport 
price incentives to encourage passengers to travel, and Ryanair continues to call on EU Govts to cut passenger 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR HOLDINGS PLC -- COVID-19 MARKET UPDATE
taxes, airport taxes, and departure taxes on an industry wide basis as a better alternative to selective State Aid 
"doping" for flag carriers.
 Examples of State Aid Doping
   - to date
 Lufthansa Group                  EUR12.4 billion
                                   plus
  AF-KLM Group                     EUR10.1 billion
                                   plus
  TUI Group                        EUR 1.8 billion
                                   plus
  Alitalia                         EUR 1.7 billion
                                   plus
  SAS                              EUR 0.8 billion
                                   plus
  Finnair                          EUR 0.7 billion
                                   plus
  Norwegian                        EUR 0.3 billion
                                   plus
  When Ryanair returns to meaningful flying from July, the competitive landscape in Europe will be 
distorted by unprecedented volumes of State Aid from some EU Governments to their "national" airlines. 
Currently this amounts to over EUR30 billion - in addition to payroll supports - mainly to the Lufthansa 
Group, Air France-KLM, Alitalia, SAS, and Norwegian. All this State Aid is in breach of EU rules, and will 
distort Europe's level playing field in airline competition for many years. Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and 
Alitalia can now fund many years of below cost selling, whereas Ryanair and other well run airlines will 
not request (and would not receive) such State Aid. Ryanair will challenge these unlawful State Aid 
bailouts in the EU Courts to protect fair competition in Europe's aviation market, which has done so much 
to lower fares for consumers over the last 20 years.
   Ryanair has repeatedly called for any State Aid to be transparent and non-discriminatory, such as 
payroll support schemes. This could, for example in Germany, have involved cutting departure taxes or 
reducing airport taxes in France, which would have benefited all airlines and passengers equally and not 
just favoured the local flag carrier. In France, the State is refunding aviation taxes but only to 
"French" airlines where all other EU airlines flying in France (such as Ryanair, EasyJet & BA) must still 
pay these taxes. This bailout discrimination is clearly in breach of State Aid and competition rules.
   Fleet Review
   Ryanair is now reviewing its growth plans, and aircraft orders. We are in active negotiations with both 
Boeing, and Laudamotion's A320 lessors to cut the number of planned aircraft deliveries over the next 24 
months, which could reduce our capex commitments, to more accurately reflect a slower and more distorted 
EU air travel market in a post Covid-19 world.
   3,000 Job Cuts and Pay Cuts - Consultations
   As a direct result of the unprecedented Covid-19 crisis, the grounding of all flights from mid-March 
until at least July, and the distorted State Aid landscape in Europe, Ryanair now expects the recovery of 
passenger demand and pricing (to 2019 levels) will take at least 2 years, until summer 2022 at the 
earliest. The Ryanair Airlines will shortly notify their trade unions about its restructuring and job loss 
program, which will commence from July 2020. These plans will be subject to consultation but will affect 
all Ryanair Airlines, and may result in the loss of up to 3,000 mainly pilot and cabin crew jobs, unpaid 
leave, and pay cuts of up to 20%, and the closure of a number of aircraft bases across Europe until 
traffic recovers. Job cuts and pay cuts will also be extended to Head Office and Back Office teams. Group 
CEO Michael O'Leary, whose pay was cut by 50% for April and May, has now agreed to extend this 50% pay cut 
for the remainder of the financial year to March 2021.
   Outlook
   As announced on 3 April, given the uncertain duration of the Covid-19 crisis, and a slower return to 
"normal" flight services, Ryanair cannot provide any guidance for FY21 (year ended March 2021). The Group 
expects to report a net loss of over EUR100m in Q1, with further losses in Q2 (peak summer) due to the 
substantial decline in traffic arising from Covid-19 fleet groundings. Ryanair expects that its return to 
scheduled services will be rendered more difficult by competing with flag carrier airlines, who will be 
financing below cost selling with the benefit of over EUR30 billion in unlawful State Aid, in breach of 
both EU State Aid and competition rules.
   Ryanair entered this unprecedented Covid-19 crisis with almost EUR4bn in cash, and we continue to 
actively manage these cash resources to ensure that we can survive this Covid-19 pandemic, and more 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR HOLDINGS PLC -- COVID-19 MARKET UPDATE
importantly the return to lower fare flight schedules as soon as possible, when our customers can look 
forward to more low air fares as we are forced to compete with flag carrier airlines who have received 
EUR30 billion in State Aid "doping" to allow them to sustain below cost selling for months after this 
Covid-19 crisis has passed, as it certainly will over the coming months.

   Ideagen PLC (AIM: IDEA), a leading supplier of Information Management Software to highly regulated industries, 
announces that it has allotted a total of 208,334 new ordinary shares of 1 penny each in the capital of the Company

   Application has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the 208,334 new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to 
trading on AIM ("Admission") and it is expected that Admission will become effective and trading will commence at 
8.00 a.m. on 4 May 2020.
   After Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue will be 226,583,386 and the total number of voting 
rights will therefore be 226,583,386. This figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the 
calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest 
in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure and Transparency Rules.

   (ii) Full name of the legal entity and other identifying specification of the issuer or underlying 
issuer, provided it is reliable and accurate (e.g. address, LEI, domestic number identity).

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same 
or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) 
the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.
   In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations 
(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who 
should be mentioned:
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (b) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled 
to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring

   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (c) of the Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
of Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity holding the collateral, provided the person 
or entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and natural person or 
legal entity lodging the collateral under these conditions;

Directive 2004/109/EC), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification 
duty at an individual level under Regulation 14 of the Regulations (Article 9 of Directive 2004/109/EC), 
under letters (a) to (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC) or

the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit

Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;

Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.

rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.

2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same 
or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) 
the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.
   In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations 
(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who 
should be mentioned:
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (b) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled 
to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring

or entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and natural person or

shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting 
rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.

2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   ("Ideagen," "the Company" or the "Group")
   Exercise of Options and Total Voting Rights
   Ideagen PLC (AIM: IDEA), a leading supplier of Information Management Software to highly regulated industries, 
announces that it has allotted a total of 7,500 new ordinary shares of 1 penny each in the capital of the Company 
("Ordinary Shares") following the exercise of options over 7,500 Ordinary Shares by an employee.
   Application has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the 7,500 new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to 
trading on AIM ("Admission") and it is expected that Admission will become effective and trading will commence at 
8.00 a.m. on 15 April 2020.
   After Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue will be 226,369,479 and the total number of voting 
rights will therefore be 226,369,479. This figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the 
calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest 
in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure and Transparency Rules.

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
 As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same or 
different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) the 
standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.
 In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations 
(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who 
should be mentioned:
 -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (b) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled

temporarily for consideration the voting rights;
 -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (c) of the Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of

entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and natural person or

 -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (e) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification

shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
 (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) to 
(h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty to 
the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 Directive 
2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the lowest 
notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the requirements of 
the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
 (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
 (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.

rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and

another undertaking then the second option applies.
 (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or 
legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed 
or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a 
full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or 
financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row 
free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
 (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
 (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.

2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   TOTAL VOTING RIGHTS
   In conformity with Regulation 20 of the Transparency (Directive 2004/109 EC) Regulations 2007 (as amended), 
Ryanair announces that as at 31 March 2020:
   Ryanair's issued share capital consists of  1,089,181,737 Ordinary Shares of nominal value EUR0.006 each with 
voting rights. Ryanair does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury.  Therefore, the total number of voting rights in 
Ryanair is 1,089,181,737.
   The above figure may be used by shareholders as a denominator for the calculation by which they will determine

   Ideagen PLC (AIM: IDEA), a leading supplier of Information Management Software to highly regulated industries, 
announces that it has allotted a total of 4,538 new ordinary shares of 1 penny each in the capital of the Company

   Application has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the 4,538 new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to 
trading on AIM ("Admission") and it is expected that Admission will become effective and trading will commence at 
8.00 a.m. on 2 April 2020.

rights will therefore be 226,361,979. This figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the 
calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest 
in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure and Transparency Rules.

the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.

(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who

   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting 
rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.

ends.
   (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once

presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 
2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same 
or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) 
the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.
   In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations 
(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who 
should be mentioned:

Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled

or entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and natural person or

   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.

another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   Ryanair Holdings PLC
   16 March 2020
   RYANAIR TAKING URGENT ACTION TO RESPOND TO COVID-19
   UPDATE MON 16 MARCH 2020
   Over the past week, the spread of the Covid-19 virus and associated Government travel restrictions, 
many of which have been imposed without notice, have had a significant and negative impact on the 
schedules of all Ryanair Group Airlines.
   Over the past 7 days, Italy, Malta, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Greece, Morocco, Spain, 
Portugal, Denmark, Poland, Norway and Cyprus have imposed flight bans of varying degrees, from all flights 
to/from the country, or banned flights to/from countries with high risk of Covid infection. Over the 
weekend for example, Poland and Norway have banned all international flights, while in other countries 
(without travel bans) there has been severe reduction of ATC and essential airport services.
   Ryanair expects the result of these restrictions will be the grounding of the majority of its aircraft 
fleet across Europe over the next 7 to 10 days. In those countries where the fleet is not grounded, social 
distancing restrictions may make flying to all intents and purposes, impractical, if not, impossible.
   For April and May, Ryanair now expects to reduce its seat capacity by up to 80%, and a full grounding 
of the fleet cannot be ruled out. Ryanair is taking immediate action to reduce operating expenses, and 
improve cash flows. This will involve grounding surplus aircraft, deferring all capex and share buybacks, 
freezing recruitment and discretionary spending, and implementing a series of voluntary leave options, 
temporarily suspending employment contracts, and significant reductions to working hours and payments. We 
are working with our people and our unions across all EU countries to address this extraordinary and 
unprecedented Covid-19 event, the impact and duration of which is, at this time, impossible to determine.
   The Ryanair Group has strong liquidity, with strong cash and cash equivalents of over EUR4bn as at 12 
March. Our focus now is on completing as much of the scheduled flying program as is permitted by National 
Governments over the next 7 days, so that we can repatriate customers, where possible, even as flight bans 
are imposed and ATC and essential airport services are reduced. We have seen a substantial decline in 
bookings over the last 2 weeks, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. We will 
continue to monitor demand, as well as Government flight restrictions, and we will continue to make 
further cuts to schedules as necessary.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR TAKING URGENT ACTION TO RESPOND TO COVID19
   Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
   "At the Ryanair Group Airlines, we are doing everything we can to meet the challenge posed by the 
Covid-19 outbreak, which has over the last week caused extraordinary and unprecedented travel restrictions 
to be imposed by National Governments, in many cases with minimal or zero notice. We are communicating 
with all affected passengers by email and SMS, and we are organising rescue flights to repatriate 
customers, even in those countries where travel bans have been imposed. Our priority remains the health 
and welfare of our people and our passengers, and we are doing everything we can to ensure that they can 
be reunited with their friends and families during these difficult times.
   Ryanair is taking all actions necessary to cut operating expenses, and improve cash flows at each of 
our airlines. Ryanair is a resilient airline group, with a very strong balance sheet, and substantial cash 
liquidity, and we can, and will, with appropriate and timely action, survive through a prolonged period of 
reduced or even zero flight schedules, so that we are adequately prepared for the return to normality, 
which will come about sooner rather than later as EU Governments take unprecedented action to restrict the 
spread of Covid-19".

   RYANAIR FY20 TRAFFIC CUT FROM 154M TO 151M DUE TO ITALIAN GOVT RESTRICTIONS
   NO MATERIAL CHANGE TO FY20 PAT GUIDANCE
   Ryanair today (10 March) advised that it will lower its FY20 (31 March 2020) passenger target by 3m 
from 154m to 151m. This is a direct result of the suspension of all Ryanair flights to/from Italy, between 
13 March and 8 April, in response to the Italian Government's "lock down" of travel to/from Italy, in 
addition to a number of other EU countries (Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Malta, Romania, Austria) 
unilaterally restricting flights to/from Italy.
   Ryanair does not expect these traffic reductions to have a material impact on FY20 (31 March 2020) PAT 
guidance. It is far too early to assess the impact of Covid-19 on FY21 traffic and earnings. The Ryanair 
Group will continue to focus on delivering cost savings and improved operational efficiency in FY21. 
Ryanair is one of the strongest airlines in the industry with EUR4bn in cash, industry leading unit costs, 
90% of the fleet is owned with over 70% debt free.

   Since Ryanair has cancelled up to 25% of its Italian short haul program (mainly to/from and within 
Italy) for the 3-week period from 17(th) Mar to 8(th) Apr, traffic and load factor in the months of Mar & 
Apr is likely to be lower than normal due to the fall in bookings during that period in response to the 
Covid-19 virus outbreak in a number of European countries.

   Ryanair's issued share capital consists of 1,094,030,390 Ordinary Shares of nominal value EUR0.006 each with

   02 March 2020
   RYANAIR TO CANCEL UP TO 25% OF ITALIAN SHORT HAUL FLIGHTS
   FROM 17(TH) MAR TO 8(TH) APR
   ALL AFFECTED PASSENGERS CONTACTED BY EMAIL TODAY
   Ryanair today (Mon 2 Mar) notified passengers that it was reducing its short haul flight program 
(mainly to and from Italy) by up to 25% for a 3 week period from Tues 17(th) Mar to Wed 8(th) Apr, in 
response to the Covid-19 Virus. Over the past week, Ryanair has seen a significant drop in bookings over 
that late March/early April period, in response to the Covid-19 Virus. There has also been a significant 
step up in passenger no-shows on flights, particularly from and within Italy.
   Ryanair does not expect these cancellations to have a material impact on current year (end Mar 2020) 
guidance, but it is far too early to speculate what impact the Covid-19 outbreak will have on FY21 
earnings. Ryanair will continue to monitor bookings carefully, and will continue to flex its schedules in 
response to this developing situation. Ryanair is working closely with relevant authorities and is 
following all guidelines provided by WHO and EASA to ensure the health and wellbeing of our people and our 
customers.
   A daily Covid-19 action meeting across all areas of the airline has been initiated since Mon 24(th) 
Feb, and is focusing on maintaining operational efficiency and cost saving to address the current downturn 
in business caused by the Covid-19 Virus, including;
    -     Rolling schedule cuts as booking patterns alter
    -     Allocating annual leave and/or unpaid leave to pilots and cabin crew
    -     Recruitment, and promotion and pay freezes across the network
    -     Working with 3(rd) party suppliers to cut costs.
   Ryanair remains one of the strongest airlines in the industry with EUR4bn in cash on its balance sheet, 
industry leading unit costs, 90% of the fleet is owned, and is mainly debt free. We expect that this 
Covid-19 Virus will result in further EU airline failures over the coming weeks.
   Ryanair Group CEO, Michael O'Leary said:
   "Our focus at this time is on minimising any risk to our people and our passengers. While we are 
heavily booked over the next two weeks, there has been a notable drop in forward bookings towards the end 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR TO CANCEL UP TO 25% OF ITALIAN FLIGHTS
of Mar, into early Apr. It makes sense to selectively prune our schedule to and from those airports where 
travel has been most affected by the Covid-19 outbreak.
   This is a time for calm. We will make sensible cuts to our schedules over the comings weeks to reflect 
weaker bookings, and changing travel patterns. All affected customers will be advised of any schedule 
changes at least 14 days in advance. While 80% of people who contract Covid-19 suffer only mild symptoms, 
the risk of infection can be significantly reduced by frequent hand washing with soap and water.
   We will continue to comply fully with guidelines from National Governments, the WHO and EASA as they 
are updated on a regular basis. We will update the market in due course on any significant developments"

   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) to (h) of 
Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty to the natural 
person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the 
percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of 
voting rights holdings in accordance with the requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or disposal 
took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the date when the 
corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository receipts 
representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the Regulations and the 
Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding only that the holding is "below 
3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting rights "indirect 
holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and indirect columns - if there is no 
combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.
   (x) Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares ends.
   (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once every 3 months 
starting from [date].
   (xii) In case of cash settled instruments the number and percentages of voting rights is to be presented on a delta-
adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control another undertaking 
then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or legal entity, 
has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed or reached and the 
subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a full picture of the group 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Holding(s) in Company -3-

held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free 
row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are 
effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or reach the lowest 
applicable threshold themselves.

   Notes
   (i) . Persons completing this form should have regard to the requirements of the Transparency 
(Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 as amended (the "Regulations"), the Central Bank of Ireland's 
Transparency Rules (the "Transparency Rules") and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/761 of 17 
December 2014.
   (ii) Full name of the legal entity and other identifying specification of the issuer or underlying 
issuer, provided it is reliable and accurate (e.g. address, LEI, domestic number identity).
   (iii) Other reason for the notification could be voluntary notifications, changes of attribution of the 
nature of the holding (e.g. expiring of financial instruments) or acting in concert.
   (iv) This should be the full name of (a) the shareholder; (b) the natural person or legal entity 
acquiring, disposing of or exercising voting rights in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) 
of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC); or (c) the holder of financial 
instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same 
or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) 
the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.

  EUROPE'S GREENEST, CLEANEST AIRLINE:
   The future of our planet is of vital importance to our customers and all our people. Ryanair has the 
lowest carbon emissions of any major EU airline at just 66 grams of CO per passenger km. Passengers 
switching to Ryanair can halve their CO emissions compared to other major EU airlines. In Dec. 2019, 
Ryanair appointed a Director of Sustainability to deliver the Group's ambitious sustainability targets.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
   Ryanair operates the youngest fleet, with the highest load factors, and newer more fuel-efficient 
engines. Our Environmental Policy commits us to:
    --     Be plastic free in 5 years;
    --     Cut noise emissions by up to 40% per seat;
    --     Cut CO emissions by 10% by 2030 (up to 50% lower than other major EU airlines);
    --     Encourage guests to support our voluntary carbon offset programme;
    --     Work with environmental partners to improve our environment in Europe.
   While aviation generates just 2% of Europe's CO , our industry must work harder to further cut these 
low emissions. EU airlines already pay excessive environmental taxes - Ryanair will pay over EUR630m in 
such taxes this year. For further info. click here: www.ryanair.com/environment.
   BUSINESS REVIEW:
   Revenues
   Sales grew 21% to EUR1.91bn.  Better than expected Christmas and New Year bookings, at higher fares, 
led to a 16% increase in Scheduled Revenue to EUR1.19bn as we carried 36m guests at 9% higher fares. 
Ancillary Revenue increased by 28% to EUR0.72bn as more guests choose Priority Boarding and Preferred Seat 
services. In Oct., Ryanair Labs launched a new digital platform with improved, personalised, guest offers. 
Labs are now focused on improving penetration across key ancillary products over the coming quarters. 
Rentalcars.com became our new car hire partner in late 2019 and will help grow car hire penetration and 
revenue over the next 3 years.
   Costs
   Our fuel bill rose 14% (+EUR83m) to EUR0.7bn due to higher prices and 6% traffic growth. Ex-fuel unit 
costs rose by 1% due to higher staff (increased pilot pay, higher crew ratios as pilot resignations have 
slowed to almost zero) and maintenance costs (older aircraft longer in the fleet due to the Boeing MAX 
delivery delays), offset by falling EU261 costs due to improved punctuality. Our fuel is 90% hedged for 
FY20 at $71bbl and 90% of our FY21 fuel is now hedged at $61bbl, delivering over EUR100m fuel savings into 
FY21. We continue to negotiate attractive growth deals as airports compete to win Ryanair's very limited 
traffic growth.
   Group Airlines
   The Group airlines continue to grow. In Q3 Buzz increased its fleet to 32 B737s and expanded outside 
Poland with new bases in Prague and Budapest. Buzz will grow its fleet to 50 B737s for S.20, with 7 
aircraft in Polish charter operations and 43 operating scheduled flying for Ryanair.
   Lauda continues to underperform with fares much lower than expected, despite strong traffic growth and 
high load factors. As announced on 10 Jan., this is a direct result of intense price competition with 
Lufthansa subsidiaries in both Germany and Austria. While Lauda will now carry 6.5m guests in FY20, 
average fares are well below those of other Group airlines. Lauda's management is implementing a new cost 
cutting plan and is improving penetration on ancillary products. Lauda will grow its fleet from 23 to 38 
A320s by S.20 with increased capacity in Vienna and a new base in Zadar.
   Malta Air continues to grow strongly and has taken over the Group's French, German, Italian and Maltese 
bases. Its fleet will grow to 120 aircraft by S.20.
   Ryanair DAC saw its fleet reduced to 360 B737s in Q3 as both Buzz and Malta Air took over more flight 
operations for the Group. Armenia became the newest destination in Jan. Regrettably the Boeing MAX 
delivery delays mean that Ryanair DAC had to close a number of loss-making winter bases leading to some 
crew redundancies in Spain, Germany and Sweden. We have endeavoured to minimise job losses through base 
transfers & seasonal bases and continue to work with our people, their unions and our airports to finalise 
this process.
   Boeing MAX update
   Delivery of the Group's first Boeing 737-MAX-200 aircraft has been repeatedly delayed from Q2 2019. It 
is now likely that our first MAX aircraft will not deliver until Sept. or Oct. 2020. The requirement for 
MAX simulator training will also slow down the delivery of backlogged aircraft and new deliveries. But we 
believe that these "gamechanger" aircraft (with 4% more seats, burn 16% less fuel), when delivered, will 
transform our cost base and our business for the next decade. Due to these delivery delays, we won't see 
any of these cost savings until late FY21. As a direct result of these delivery delays, we plan to extend 
our 200m p.a. passenger target by at least one or two years to FY25 or FY26.
   Balance Sheet & Shareholder Returns
   Ryanair's BBB+ rated balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry. 70% of our aircraft are 
debt free. This allows us to grow while weaker airlines collapse, sell or retrench in the current 
challenging market. We have returned EUR440m to shareholders under our current EUR700m share buyback 
programme. Despite the share buyback and the impact of IFRS 16 (EUR230m), net debt was just over EUR700m 
at period end. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the Boeing MAX aircraft deliveries, peak Capex and 
maturing bonds in 2021, the Board has decided to extend the current EUR700m buyback programme until the 
end of July.
   Outlook
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
   As announced on 10 Jan., Ryanair's FY20 PAT guidance has risen to a range of EUR0.95bn to EUR1.05bn 
thanks to stronger Christmas and New Year travel bookings, at better than expected fares. Q4 forward 
bookings are 1% ahead of this time last year at slightly better than expected average fares and we now 
expect full year traffic to grow by 8% to 154m guests. Ancillary revenues continue to grow, but at a 
slower rate having annualised the cabin bag changes in Nov. This will support full-year revenue per guest 
growth of between +3% to +4%. The full year fuel bill will rise by EUR440m and ex-fuel unit costs will 
increase by approx. 2%. On the basis of current trading, Ryanair expects to finish close to the mid-point 
of the new PAT guidance range.  This guidance is heavily dependent on close-in Q4 fares and the absence of 
any security events.

U.K., European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, uncertainties 
surrounding Brexit, weather related disruptions, ATC strikes and staffing related disruptions, delays in the delivery 
of contracted aircraft, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour

Body
   Ancillary revenues increased by 28% to EUR2,374.7M due to 9% traffic growth and improved uptake of 
ancillary products, particularly priority boarding and reserved seats.
   Total revenues:
   As a result of the above, total revenues increased by 14% to EUR7,295.7M.
   Operating Expenses:
   Fuel and oil:
   Fuel and oil increased by 20% to EUR2,272.9M due to higher fuel prices and an 11% increase in flight 
hours.
   Airport and handling charges:
   Airport and handling charges increased by 11% to EUR932.9M due to an 9% increase in traffic, new 
enhanced handling arrangements in Stansted, Spain & Poland, stronger sterling and the consolidation of 
Lauda (from August 2018).
   Staff costs:
   Staff costs increased 15% to EUR859.9M due to 11% more flight hours, the consolidation of Lauda (from 
August 2018), higher crewing ratios and the annualisation of pilot pay increases.
   Route charges:
   Route charges increased by 2% to EUR606.4M due to an 9% increase in sectors, offset by a decrease in 
unit rates.
   Depreciation:
   Depreciation increased 18% to EUR571.5M due to the impact of IFRS 16 (EUR42.9M) which was adopted from 
April 2019 and the purchase of spare engines and Boeing MAX simulators.
   Marketing, distribution and other:
   Marketing, distribution and other costs increased by 2% to EUR436.5M, slower than traffic growth, due 
to lower EU261 compensation costs.
   Maintenance, materials and repairs:
   Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by 45% to EUR200.9M due to higher scheduled engine 
maintenance due to an ageing fleet and MAX delays, costs associated with the hand back of Airbus aircraft 
and maintenance provision for 12 additional A320 operating leases.
   Aircraft rentals:
   Aircraft rentals reduced by 35% to EUR35.1M due to the adoption of IFRS 16 in April 2019, which is 
offset by higher depreciation costs.
   Unit cost per pax:
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-
   Unit cost per pax increased by 4%. Excluding fuel, unit costs per pax increased by 2%. This was 
primarily due to higher crewing ratios, the annualisation of pilot pay increases, increased ownership 
costs due to the Boeing MAX delivery delays and the handback of Airbus leases, offset by lower EU261 
compensation.
   Net finance expense:
   Net finance expense decreased by 16% to EUR38.0M primarily due to higher interest rates achieved on 
deposits and the re-financing of debt at lower interest rates. IFRS 16 had a negative impact of EUR4.0M in 
the nine month period.

   This financial report for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 meets the reporting requirements

Central Bank of Ireland.

the MD&A.
   Principal risks and uncertainties for the remainder of the year
   Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results 
for the remainder of the year are the airline pricing environment, capacity growth in Europe, fuel costs,

associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, UK, European Union 
("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, delays in the delivery of 
contracted aircraft, weather related disruptions, ATC strikes and staffing related disruptions,

   Going concern
   Having considered the Group's principal risks and uncertainties and its financial position and cash 
flows, the Directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the interim financial statements, 
that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group as a whole have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of 
the interim financial statements. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the interim financial statements.
   Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
   Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
   Interim Financial Statements
    1.            Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
   Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The unaudited condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
   These 
unaudited 
condensed 
consolidated 
interim 
financial 
statements 
("the 
interim 
financial 
statements"), which should be read in conjunction with the Ryanair 2019 Annual Report for the year ended 
March 31, 2019, have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim 
Financial Reporting" as adopted by the EU ("IAS 34"). They do not include all of the information required 
for full annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published 
consolidated financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at 
and for the year ended March 31, 2019, are available at http://investor.ryanair.com/.
   The December 31, 2019 figures and the December 31, 2018 comparative figures do not constitute statutory 
financial statements of the Group within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2014. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 31, 2019, together with the independent 
auditor's report thereon, were filed with the Irish Registrar of Companies following the Company's Annual 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-
General Meeting and are also available on the Company's Website. The auditor's report on those financial 
statements was unqualified.
   The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 on January 31, 2020.
   Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
   Accounting for assets held for sale
   Non-current assets are classified as held-for sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered 
primarily through sale rather than through continuing use. Such assets are generally measured at the lower 
of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses on initial classification as 
held-for-sale or held-for distribution and subsequent gains and losses on re-measurement are recognised in 
the income statement. Once classified as held-for-sale, intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment are no longer amortised or depreciated, and any equity-accounted investee is no longer equity 
accounted.
   New IFRS standards and amendments adopted during the year
   The following new and amended IFRS standards, amendments and IFRIC interpretations, have been issued by 
the IASB, and have also been endorsed by the EU. These standards are effective for the first time for the 
Group's financial year beginning on April 1, 2019 and therefore have been applied by the Group in these 
condensed consolidated interim financial statements:
    --              IFRS 16 - Leases (see below)
    --              Amendments to IFRS 9 - Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation
    --              IFRIC 23 - Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
    --              Amendments to IAS 28 - Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures
    --              Amendments to IAS 19 - Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement
    --              Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015 - 2017 Cycle - various standards
   With the exception of IFRS 16, the adoption of these new or amended standards did not have a material 
impact on the Group's financial position or results from operations in the nine months ended December 31, 
2019. The impact of adoption of IFRS 16 is set out below.
   IFRS 16 - Leases
   The Group has adopted IFRS 16 with effect from April 1, 2019.  IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance 
sheet, lease accounting model for lessees.  A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its 
right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease 
payments.
   The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach, under which the cumulative 
effect of initial application is recognised in retained earnings at April 1, 2019.  Accordingly, the 
comparative information presented for 2018 has not been restated - i.e. it is presented, as previously 
reported, under IAS 17 and related interpretations.  The details of the changes in accounting policies are 
disclosed below.

  Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
   MD&A Quarter Ended December 31, 2019
   Income Statement
   Scheduled revenues:
   Scheduled revenues increased by 16% to EUR1,186.0M due to 6% traffic growth to 35.9M guests and a 9% 
increase in average fares.
   Ancillary revenues:
   Ancillary revenues increased by 28% to EUR720.0M due to 6% traffic growth and improved uptake of ancillary 
products, particularly priority boarding and reserved seats.
   Total Revenue:
   As a result of the above, total revenue increased by 21% to EUR1,906.0M.
   Operating Expenses:
   Fuel and oil:
   Fuel and oil increased by 14% to EUR686.0M due to higher fuel prices and an 8% increase in flight hours.
   Airport and handling charges:
   Airport and handling charges increased by 7% to EUR272.7M primarily due to a 6% increase in traffic, stronger 
sterling and new enhanced handling arrangements in Stansted, Spain & Poland.
   Staff costs:
   Staff costs increased 11% to EUR276.5M due to 8% more flight hours, higher crewing ratios and the 
annualisation of pilot pay increases.
   Route charges:
   Route charges remained flat at EUR180.4M, with a 6% increase in sectors offset by a decrease in unit rates.
   Depreciation:
   Depreciation increased 17% to EUR190.4M due to higher capitalised maintenance and the impact of IFRS 16 
(EUR15.6M) which was adopted from April 1, 2019.
   Marketing, distribution and other:
   Marketing, distribution and other reduced by 4% to EUR137.4M due to lower EU261 compensation costs.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -4-

due to an ageing fleet, MAX delays and provision for 12 additional A320 operating leases.

higher crewing ratios, the annualisation of pilot pay increases and increased ownership costs due to the Boeing 
MAX delivery delays, offset by lower EU261 compensation costs.
   Net finance expense:
   Net finance expense decreased by 20% to EUR11.3M as a result of higher interest rates achieved on deposits 
and the re-financing of debt at lower interest rates. IFRS 16 had a negative EUR1.4M impact in the quarter.

   Gross cash increased by EUR417.1M to EUR3,612.0M at December 31, 2019.
   Gross debt increased by EUR678.7M to EUR4,323.1M due to a new EUR750.0M low cost syndicated bank

liability payments. EUR1,744.0M net cash was generated by operating activities. Net capital expenditure was 
EUR1,375.1M and shareholder returns amounted to EUR371.5M.

  Diluted earnings per share takes account of the potential future exercises of share options granted 
under the Company's share option schemes and the weighted average number of shares includes weighted 
average share options assumed to be converted of EUR5.3M (2018: EUR8.4M).
    10.          Property, plant and equipment
   Acquisitions and disposals
   Capital expenditure in the nine-months ended December 31, 2019 amounted to EUR1,375.1M and primarily 
relates to aircraft deposits, spare engines, simulators and heavy maintenance checks.
    11.          Assets held for sale
   In August 2019, the Company entered into an agreement to sell 10 Boeing 737-800 aircraft for delivery 
in FY20 and FY21. 3 of these aircraft were sold in the quarter ended December 31, 2019. The remaining 7 
aircraft are presented as assets held for sale as at December 31, 2019 and are stated at the lower of 
their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
    12.          Financial instruments and financial risk management
   The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
   These interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 
Ryanair 2019 Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies during the year.
   Fair value hierarchy
   Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
   --           Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
that the Group can access at the measurement date.
   --           Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
that asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
    --           Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
   Fair value estimation
   Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -7-
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
   Financial instruments measured at fair value
   --           Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to 
determine the fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
   --           Derivatives - currency forwards and aircraft fuel contracts: A comparison of the 
contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at December 31, 2019 has 
been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
   The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the nine months ended December 31, 
2019, there were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair 
value hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
   Financial instruments not measured at fair value
   --           Long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at December 31, 2019 to arrive 
at a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
   There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the nine months 
ended December 31, 2019 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.
    12.          Financial instruments and financial risk management (continued)
   The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial balance sheet, are as follows:

   As a lessee, the Group previously classified leases as operating or finance leases based on its 
assessment of whether the lease transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.  
Under IFRS 16, the Group recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases i.e. these 
leases are on-balance sheet.
   The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for some leases of 
low-value assets and has applied the exemption not to recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for 
leases with terms less than 12 months.
   The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.  The 
right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the lease liability.   The 
lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the 
commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be 
readily determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental 
borrowing rate as the discount rate.
   The Group has determined the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a lessee that include 
renewal options.  The assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise such options 
impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use 
assets recognised. As at December 31, 2019, the Group's right-of-use assets relate to leased aircraft.
   The impact of the IFRS 16 transition increased non-current assets on April 1, 2019 by EUR130.7M, 
increased liabilities by EUR140.4M and reduced equity (distributable reserves) by EUR9.7M.
   When measuring lease liabilities for leases that were previously classified as operating leases, the 
Group has discounted lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate at April 1, 2019, the rates which 
ranged from between 2.5% and 3.0%.
   Impact of IFRS 16 in the nine-month period:
   During the nine-month period ended December 31, 2019 non-current assets increased by EUR93.7M and 
liabilities increased by EUR90.5M (net) due to the addition of 15 leased aircraft to the fleet.
   The Group has recognised depreciation and interest expenses instead of operating lease expenses in 
relation to those leases under IFRS 16. During the nine months ended December 31, 2019, the Group 
recognised EUR42.9M of depreciation expense and EUR4.0M of lease interest expenses from these leases in 
the condensed consolidated interim income statement.
   New IFRS standards and amendments issued but not yet effective
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -6-
   The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for the purposes 
of the preparation of future financial statements, where applicable.  While under review, we do not 
anticipate that the adoption of the other new or revised standards and interpretations will have a 
material impact on our financial position or results from operations:
   --              Amendments to References to Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020)
   --              Amendments to IFRS 3 - Definition of a Business (effective for fiscal periods beginning 
on or after January 1, 2020)*
   --              Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 - Definition of Material (effective for fiscal periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2020)
   --              IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after 
January 1, 2021)*
    --     Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7)
   *These standards or amendments to standards are not as yet EU endorsed
    2.            Judgements and estimates
   The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
   In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements made 
by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty 
were the same as those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
    3.            Seasonality of operations
   The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly, 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
    4.            Income tax
   The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the nine-months ended December 
31, 2019 was 7.5% (December 31, 2018: 8.1%).  The tax charge for the nine-months ended December 31, 2019 
of EUR100.6M (December 31, 2018: EUR95.3M) comprises a current tax charge of EUR146.1M and a deferred tax 
credit of EUR45.5M primarily relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment and 
net operating losses.
    5.            Share based payments
   The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR5.9M in the nine months ended December 31, 2019 
(December 31, 2018: EUR7.5M) is the fair value of options granted in prior periods, which is being 
recognised within the income statement in accordance with employee services rendered.  During the period 
1.9M ordinary shares were issued at a strike price between EUR6.25 and EUR6.74 per share following the 
exercise of vested options.
    6.            Contingencies
   The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
    7.            Capital commitments
   At December 31, 2019 the Group had an operating fleet of 445 (2018: 456) Boeing 737 and 23 (2018: 11) 
Airbus A320 aircraft. The Group has agreed to purchase up to 210 (135 firm and 75 options) Boeing 737-MAX-
200 aircraft from the Boeing Corporation during the periods over the next four years.
    8.            Analysis of operating segment
   The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the Group CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). There have been no 
changes to the basis of segmentation or the measurement basis for the segment profit or loss since the 
prior year. The intent to create a new Group structure was announced in February 2019.  The Group 
currently comprises four separate airlines, Buzz, Lauda, Malta Air (established in June 2019) and Ryanair 
DAC.  While good progress has been made in developing our Group airlines, we have not yet finalised the 
operational structures, the basis of allocation of capital and resources and the form and content of 
reporting of performance.
   Accordingly, the Group remained managed as a single business unit and is reported as a single 
reportable segment.  We expect the implementation of the group structure will be finalised in the coming 
months, at which stage the basis of segmentation will be reviewed and updated, where necessary, in our 
March 31, 2020 Annual Report.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -6-
   The CODM assessed the performance of the business based on the profit/(loss) after tax of the Group for 
the nine months.

   Ryanair Holdings PLC
   16 January 2020
   RYANAIR CALLS ON CHANCELLOR SAJID JAVID TO EXTEND FLYBE APD 'HOLIDAY' TO ALL UK AIRLINE COMPETITORS
   Ryanair, which is the largest passenger airline operating to and from the UK today (Thurs, 16 Jan) 
wrote to Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sajid Javid MP, calling on him to extend the APD eco tax 'holiday' 
given to Flybe, to all of its UK airline competitors including Ryanair, Easyjet and BA, as otherwise this 
government subsidy to the billionaire owners of Flybe will be in breach of Competition law and State Aid 
rules.
   Ryanair pointed out that the Flybe business model is neither profitable nor viable and has lurched from 
failure to failure repeatedly over the last 20 years.
   Ryanair also pointed out that while the Flybe business model is unsustainable, it is owned by 
billionaires including Richard Branson, Delta Airlines and Cyrus Capital, who do not need a Government 
subsidy to prop up their failed airline investments.  Ryanair also rejected the false claims made by 
Andrea Leadsom that Flybe has a 'viable' business model when everyone in the industry knows that the Flybe 
business model is doomed to fail again and again.
   Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
   "This Government bailout of the billionaire owned Flybe is in breach of both Competition and State Aid 
laws. The Flybe model is not viable which is why its billionaire owners are looking for a state subsidy 
for their failed investment.
   The reason why Flybe isn't viable is because it cannot compete with lower fare services from UK 
regional airports on domestic and EU routes provided by Ryanair, Easyjet, BA and others; and it cannot 
compete with lower cost road and rail alternatives on many smaller UK domestic routes.  If Flybe fails (as 
it undoubtedly will once this Government subsidy ends) then Ryanair, Easyjet, BA and others will step in 
and provide lower fare flights from the UK regional airports, as we already have to make up for the recent 
failure of Thomas Cook Airways.
   This Flybe 'subsidy' cannot comply with Competition, or State Aid rules unless the same APD eco tax 
holiday and other Government subsidies are extended to all other UK competitor airlines including Ryanair, 
Easyjet, BA among others."

   10 January 2020
   RYANAIR RAISES FY GUIDANCE TO NEW RANGE EUR950M - EUR1,050M
   STRONGER CHRISTMAS PERIOD TRAFFIC AND YIELDS
   LAUDA LOSSES RISE FROM EUR80M TO EUR90M ON PRICE WARS
   Ryanair today (10 Jan) issued a trading update on the back of a stronger than expected Christmas and 
New Year travel period, characterised by higher than expected close-in bookings at better than expected 
yields.  Forward bookings Jan to Apr are running 1% ahead of this time last year, and Ryanair believes 
this will result in slightly better than expected ave. fares in Q4, while full year Group traffic will 
grow to 154m (previously guided at 153m).
   At the same time, Ryanair's Austrian subsidiary, Laudamotion, continues to underperform with ave. fares 
over Christmas lower than expected, despite strong traffic growth and high load factors.  This is a direct 
result of intense price competition with Lufthansa subsidiaries in both Germany and Austria who are 
engaged in below cost selling.  Lauda now expects to carry 6.5m passengers in the year to March 2020 but 
at ave. fares that are EUR15 below budget, with the result that Lauda's net loss for the year will widen 
from under EUR80m to approx. EUR90m.
   As a consequence of this better Christmas/New Year travel period and stronger forward bookings in Q4, 
Ryanair believes it is appropriate to raise its Full Year PAT guidance range from EUR800m - EUR900m, to a 
new range of EUR950m - EUR1,050m.  On the basis of current trading, Ryanair expects to finish close to the 
mid-point of this new range.  Ryanair will release its Q3 results on 3(rd) February next and will update 
shareholders in further detail on these trends at that time.

   RYANAIR SLOWS S.2020 GROWTH DUE TO BOEING MAX DELAYS
   Nuremberg (2 aircraft) and Stockholm Skavsta (4) to close in March
   Ryanair Holdings plc today (4 Dec) updated investors on further delivery delays of the B737 MAX 
aircraft for summer 2020. Ryanair has again revised its S.2020 schedule based on receiving just 10 MAX 
aircraft rather than the 20 as previously planned.
   As a result, expected traffic growth for FY21 (y.e. 31 March 2021) is cut from 157m guests to 156m. 
This shortfall in MAX aircraft deliveries will necessitate the closure of two more bases in S.2020; 
Nuremberg and Stockholm Skavsta. We also expect to cut summer capacity in a number of other existing 
bases, and we are currently in discussions with our people, our unions, and our affected airports to 
finalise these minor reductions.
   Ryanair DAC CEO Eddie Wilson said:
   "We regret these two further base closures and minor capacity cuts at other bases which are solely due 
to further delivery delays to our Boeing MAX aircraft. We are continuing to work with Boeing, our people, 
our unions and our affected airports to minimise these capacity cuts and job losses".

   Ideagen PLC
   ("Ideagen" "the Company" or "the Group")
   PDMR Dealing and Total Voting Rights
   Ideagen PLC (AIM: IDEA), a leading supplier of Information Management software to highly regulated industries, 
announces that on 29 November 2019 Ian Hepworth, a PDMR and Chief Technology Officer of the Company, 
exercised 83,000 options over new ordinary shares of 1 pence each in the capital of the Company ("Ordinary 
Shares") and subsequently sold 76,000 Ordinary Shares at a price of 180 pence per Ordinary Share to cover the 
option price and tax costs. Following the exercise and sale Mr. Hepworth's beneficial interest has increased by 
7,000 Ordinary Shares to 31,477 Ordinary Shares representing 0.01 per cent. of the total voting rights of the 
Company.
   Application has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the 83,000 new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to 
trading on AIM ("Admission") and it is expected that Admission will become effective and trading will commence at 
8.00 a.m. on 6 December 2019.
   After Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue will be 226,270,708 and the total number of voting 
rights will therefore be 226,270,708. This figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the 
calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest 
in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure and Transparency Rules.

   easyJet plc
   Results for the year ending 30 September 2019
   easyJet announces a strong finish to 2019
   driven by the delivery of self-help initiatives in challenging market conditions
   easyJet to become the world's first major airline to operate net-zero carbon flights
   by offsetting the carbon emissions from the fuel used on the flights
   Summary
   --     Against the background of a difficult year, in the year ending 30 September 2019, easyJet has:
   o  delivered full year results in line with expectations, with headline profit before tax towards the 
top end of guidance,
   o  achieved solid revenue per seat during the second half of the year, as our self-help initiatives  
deliver valuable returns
   o  demonstrated good operational performance thanks to our ongoing operational resilience programme and 
continued strong cost control, in spite of a difficult Q4 disruption environment (weather and LGW issues)
   --     Passenger numbers for the year ending 30 September 2019 increased by 8.6% to 96.1 million (2018 
10.2%)
   --     Capacity(1) increased by 10.3% due to growth across all regions. Load factor decreased by 1.4 
percentage points to 91.5%
   --     Total revenue increased by 8.3% to GBP6,385 million (2018: GBP5,898 million) enabled by our 
increase in capacity. Total revenue per seat decreased by 1.8% to GBP60.81 (2018: GBP61.94), driven by 
some weakness in consumer confidence, notably offset by the self-help initiatives delivered in the second 
half of the financial year and the positive impact from strikes at British Airways and Ryanair. The self-
help initiatives included a focus on optimising late yield, whilst maintaining our commitment to offer 
great value.  Revenue per seat at constant currency(2) for the year ending 30 September 2019 decreased by 
2.7%, but increased by 0.8% during the second half, reflecting these self-help initiatives
   --     Headline cost per seat excluding fuel at constant currency(2) was down 0.8% to GBP43.11, mainly 
due to the successful delivery of the operational resilience programme which drove disruption costs down 
easyJet PLC Final Results
for the year. Headline cost per seat increased by 1.5% to GBP56.74 (2018: GBP55.87) as a result of higher 
unit fuel(3) costs and adverse foreign exchange movements
   --     Cost and efficiency programme savings of GBP139 million (2018: GBP107 million) were delivered 
over the year
   --     Non-headline items of GBP3 million positive (2018: GBP133 million cost).  Total cost per seat, 
including the impact of non-headline items was GBP56.71 (2018: GBP57.26)
   --     Headline profit before tax was down 26% to GBP427 million (2018: GBP578 million), towards the 
top of the GBP420-430 million guidance range.  Total headline profit before tax per seat decreased by 
32.9% to GBP4.07 per seat (2018: GBP6.07 per seat)
    --     Reported profit before tax decreased to GBP430 million (2018 GBP445 million)
   --     Headline ROCE for the year decreased to 11.4% (2018: 14.6%).  On a like-for-like accounting 
basis, headline ROCE decreased to 9.9%(4) .
    --     Proposed dividend of 43.9 pence (2018: 58.6p) subject to approval by shareholders
   --     Balance sheet strength amongst the best in the sector, with a net debt position of GBP326 
million
   Looking forward
   --    From today onwards easyJet will make all flights net zero carbon.  By offsetting the carbon 
emissions from the fuel used on the flights across our whole network we will become the world's first 
major net zero carbon airline.  Carbon offsetting is an interim measure  and we will continue the push to 
reinvent aviation for the long-term, including development of sustainable fuel and electric flying
   --    easyJet holidays will launch in the UK before Christmas and will offer beach and city holidays, 
travelling across easyJet's network.  Flexibility will play a key part in the new offering allowing 
customers to holiday the way they want by choosing from a huge range of flight options paired with 
Europe's most loved hotels, all at great value
   Outlook
   --    Forward bookings for the first half of the 2020 financial year are reassuring. Bookings are 
slightly ahead of last year (recognising that the second quarter is a weak comparative)
   --    easyJet's expected capacity growth for the year ending 30 September 2020 will be at the lower end 
of historic guidance of between 3% and 8% per year
   --    Headline airline revenue per seat at constant currency(2) in the first half of the 2020 financial 
year is expected to be up low to mid single digits
   --    Headline airline cost per seat excluding fuel at constant currency(2) for the full year to 30 
September 2020 is expected to be up by low single digits, assuming normal levels of disruption
   --    easyJet Holidays is expected to be at least breakeven for the financial year to 30 September 2020
   --    Offsetting carbon emissions from the fuel used for all flights on behalf of customers is expected 
to cost c.GBP25 million in the financial year to 30 September 2020, and is reflected within our guidance 
of total fuel costs
   --    Capital expenditure for the financial year to 30 September 2020 is expected to be around GBP1,350 
million
   --    easyJet has been operating since March 2019 in a state of full preparedness for all possible 
Brexit outcomes. We are structured as a pan-European airline group with three Air Operator Certificates 
based in Austria, Switzerland and the UK.  Around 50% of our equity capital is held by qualifying European 
nationals. We continue to closely monitor customer demand in relation to Brexit.
   Commenting on the results, Johan Lundgren, easyJet Chief Executive said:
   "easyJet finished the 2019 financial year with a strong performance across the business and a record 
summer. More customers than ever are coming to easyJet as their airline of choice, with a record 96.1 
million customers flying with us this year.  Our self-help initiatives meant we have been able reduce 
costs and drive a better yield performance which has improved revenue per seat in the second half of the 
year.
   "We have also invested in tackling disruption for our customers through our Operational Resilience 
programme, which has reduced cancellations by 46% and lowered delays of 3 hours or more by 24% year on 
year.  All of these efforts have led to easyJet being the number one airline in the UK in terms of 
customer satisfaction, ahead of BA and Jet2; and the first choice airline brand and considered best value 
for money across Europe.
   "I am really thrilled that with the launch, before Christmas, of our brand new easyJet Holidays 
business we are bringing flexibility and excellent value to the holiday market.  We are now able to offer 
our customers more than 100 amazing beach and city holiday destinations, pairing Europe's best short-haul 
flight network with more than 5,000 of Europe's best hotels.  We believe there is a gap in the market for 
a modern, relevant and flexible business for today's consumer.
   "And finally I am proud that we have announced that from today we will be the world's first major 
airline to operate net-zero carbon flights across our whole network.  We are doing this by offsetting the 
carbon emissions from the fuel used for all of our flights.  We recognise that offsetting is only an 
easyJet PLC Final Results
interim measure, but we want to take action on our carbon emissions now. easyJet has a long tradition of 
efficient flying - the aircraft we fly and the way we fly them means that easyJet is already more 
efficient than many airlines. However, our priority is to continue to work on reducing our carbon 
footprint in the short term, coupled with long-term work to support the development of new technology, 
including electric planes, to reinvent aviation for the long-term."

   Notes
   (i) . Persons completing this form should have regard to the requirements of the Transparency 
(Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 as amended (the "Regulations"), the Central Bank of Ireland's 
Transparency Rules (the "Transparency Rules") and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/761 of 17 
December 2014.
   (ii) Full name of the legal entity and other identifying specification of the issuer or underlying 
issuer, provided it is reliable and accurate (e.g. address, LEI, domestic number identity).

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same 
or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) 
the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.
   In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations 
(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who 
should be mentioned:
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (b) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled 
to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring 
temporarily for consideration the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (c) of the Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
of Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity holding the collateral, provided the person 
or entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and natural person or 
legal entity lodging the collateral under these conditions;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity who has a life interest in shares if that

   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (e) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification 
duty at an individual level under Regulation 14 of the Regulations (Article 9 of Directive 2004/109/EC), 
under letters (a) to (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC) or 
under a combination of any of those situations, the controlled undertaking;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (f) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to 
the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares allowing the deposit 
taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (g) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;
   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Holding(s) in Company -2-
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
   (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the 
Regulations and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding 
only that the holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
   (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting 
rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.

ends.
   (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once 
every 3 months starting from [date].

presented on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 
2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.

   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or

another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

   For example, if salt is bad for you, how come the Italians, who consume far more of it than we do, live 
longer?
   Unless there is a good explanation, salt is perhaps unfairly maligned.
   One of my own 'small truths', in the early days of Wetherspoon, was that my pals and I went out mostly 
to talk; this was made far more difficult (and less enjoyable) by music blaring in pubs, restaurants and 
clubs, as it usually is still today - the music-free hunch was right and forms an important part of our 
business today.
   The trenchant debate surrounding Brexit, thanks to our democratic freedom, has, in my view, exploded 
myths and increased knowledge on key subjects like trade, tariffs, government and Europe - on a vast 
scale.
   For example, the pugnacious Jean-Marc Puissesseau, head of Calais ports, has completely
   undermined the false presumption that the channel ports will seize up post Brexit, without a 'deal'.
   "There will be no queues," says Mr Puissesseau - "C'est la bulls...."
   Irish airline Ryanair has recently exploded the fallacy that planes wouldn't fly without a deal - it's 
no longer an issue, they say, supported by British Airways.
   Perhaps the hardest myth to disprove, in recent years, has been that UK banks would relocate en masse 
to the continent - which has turned out to be nonsense.
   More people are employed in the City today than before the referendum - and thousands of mini 
initiatives have been undertaken by City of London individuals and organisations to ensure that trade 
continues.
   But there's one enduring myth, broadly accepted by both Leavers and Remainers, which needs to be killed 
off now.
   This is that the UK, and economies generally, are axiomatically better off, if politicians organise 
vast and all-encompassing trade deals.
   In reality, common sense and experience indicate that vast teams of lawyers and civil servants trying 
to encompass every future trading eventuality in a mega document - or a deal - is a potential minefield of 
trouble.
   Look at the problems suffered by African farmers who've been legged over in so-called 'free-trade' 
deals with the lawyer-dominated EU.
   A whole range of mini deals is surely better. Let Mr Puissesseau and his British counterparts, 
facilitated by civil servants, of course, if required, sort out the channel ports.
Wetherspoon (JD) PLC Trading Statement -3-
   Let Ryanair, British Airways and the relevant aviation organisations agree on a sensible modus 
operandi.
   Let City of London banks, helped, where needed, by government officials, arrange their own cross-border 
affairs.
   Let Wetherspoon arrange brandy from Australia and sparkling wine from England, if we feel that 
continental supplies are in jeopardy (we agreed with Mr Puissesseau about this, but wanted to
   prove that there are always non-EU alternatives).
   Let the excellent Swedish company Kopparberg produce cider in Somerset, which it now does.
   The idea that you need to sign a vast mega deal with the EU or the USA is beloved of lawyers and 
bureaucrats and
 is almost universally accepted - yet is a myth....    "

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
   As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same 
or different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) 
the standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.

(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who 
should be mentioned:

   -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (c) of the Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10

duty at an individual level under Regulation 14 of the Regulations (Article 9 of Directive 2004/109/EC), 
under letters (a) to (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC) or

at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
   (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) 
to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty 
to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 
Directive 2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the 
lowest notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the 
requirements of the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
   (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
   (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is

2004/109/EC).
   (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
Ryanair Holdings PLC Holding(s) in Company -2-
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
   (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

  EUROPE'S GREENEST, CLEANEST AIRLINE:
   The welfare of our planet is of vital importance to our customers and our people. Ryanair has the 
lowest carbon emissions of any major EU airline at just 66 grams of CO per passenger km. Passengers 
switching to Ryanair can halve their CO emissions compared to some other major EU carriers. Ryanair 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report
operates the youngest fleet, the highest load factors, and newest most fuel-efficient engines. Ryanair 
will, over the next decade, cut carbon emissions by 10% and noise emissions by 40%.
   Ryanair launched its new Environmental Policy at its Sept. AGM, committing to;
    --     Be plastic free in 5 years;
    --     Cut noise emissions by up to 40% per seat;
    --     Cut CO emissions by a further 10% by 2030 (up to 50% less than other major EU airlines);
    --     Encourage guests to use our voluntary carbon offset programme;
    --     Work with environmental partners to improve our environment in Europe.
   While aviation is responsible for just 2% of Europe's carbon, our industry must work to further cut 
this very low level of emissions. EU airlines already pay substantial environmental taxes - Ryanair will 
pay over EUR630m in such taxes this year. For further info. click here: www.ryanair.com/environment.
   BUSINESS REVIEW:
   Revenues
   Revenue grew 11% to EUR5.39bn.  Scheduled Sales rose 5% to EUR3.74bn as we carried 86m guests at 5% 
lower air fares due to the weak consumer demand in the UK and overcapacity in Germany and Austria. 
Ancillary Revenue jumped 28% to EUR1.65bn as more guests chose Priority Boarding and Preferred Seat 
services. In Oct., Ryanair Labs launched a new digital platform with improved, personalised, guest offers.
   Costs
   Our fuel bill rose 22% (+EUR289m) to EUR1.59bn due to higher prices and 11% traffic growth. Ex-fuel 
unit costs rose 2%, primarily due to higher staff costs, increased pilot pay and higher than expected crew 
ratios (as pilot resignations slowed to almost zero), higher maintenance (as older aircraft remain in the 
fleet due to the Boeing MAX delivery delays), and the consolidation of Lauda costs. This was partially 
offset by improved punctuality and lower EU261 costs. Our fuel is 90% hedged for FY20 at a rate of $71bbl.  
Currently 63% of our FY21 fuel is hedged at $61bbl. We continue to negotiate attractive growth deals as 
airports compete to win Ryanair's traffic growth. Sadly, due to the MAX delivery delays, we will be forced 
to cut or close a number of loss making bases this winter leading to pilot and cabin crew job losses. We 
continue to work with our people and their unions to finalise this process.
   Group Airlines
   The Group airlines continue to develop strongly. Buzz flew 24 B737s in S.19 from its 6 Polish bases, 
and is developing growth opportunities in other Central EU countries. 7 aircraft are dedicated to charter 
operations with the remaining 17 operating scheduled flying for Ryanair.
   Lauda's pricing environment remains difficult in its key Austrian and German markets and Lauda's 
revenue per guest remains behind target. They are working hard to grow ancillary services, lower costs and 
increase efficiencies. This summer Lauda operated 80 routes across its 4 bases.  With A320 aircraft and 
pilots recently released from the failure of Thomas Cook and Adria Airways, Lauda plans to grow from a 
fleet of 23 A320s in S.19 to 38 for S.20. While still loss making in FY20, we expect this very strong 
traffic growth, cost reduction and improved ancillary spend will push it towards breakeven in FY21.
   Malta Air became the 4(th) airline in the Ryanair Group in June. Over the next 3 years Malta Air will 
grow our Maltese base from 6 to 10 based aircraft. It will also, over the coming year, operate most of the 
Group's French, German and Italian bases.
   During H1 Ryanair DAC opened 5 new bases (Bordeaux, Marseille, Toulouse, Southend & Berlin) and 
launched 241 new routes, including new country markets in Ukraine, Turkey and Lebanon. Ryanair will 
operate to Georgia and Armenia in S.20. Eddie Wilson was appointed CEO of Ryanair DAC in Sept., reporting 
directly to the Group CEO.
   Boeing MAX update
   Delivery of the Group's first B737-MAX-200 aircraft has been repeatedly delayed from Q2 2019. We now 
expect our first MAX aircraft to deliver in March/April 2020 at the earliest (subject to EASA approval).  
The risk of further delay is rising. We expect to receive only 20 MAX-200s (previously 58) in time for 
S.20 which has cut our S.20 growth rate from 7% to 3% (162m to 157m guests in FY21). We remain confident 
that these "gamechanger" aircraft (which have 4% more seats, but burn 16% less fuel) when delivered will 
transform our cost base and our business for the next decade. Due to these delivery delays, we will not 
see any of these expected cost savings delivered until FY21.
   Balance Sheet & Shareholder Returns
   Ryanair's BBB+ rated balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry and 70% of our aircraft 
fleet is debt free. This allows us to grow while weaker airlines collapse, sell or retrench in the 
current, difficult, market conditions. We have, to date, returned over EUR250m to shareholders under our 
EUR700m 2019 share buyback programme. With EUR450m still unspent, we retain the flexibility to repurchase 
more shares from UK holders in any hard Brexit scenario. Despite the share buyback and the impact of 
IFRS16 (EUR227m), net debt was just EUR460m at period end.
   Outlook
   Our outlook for the remainder of the year remains cautious. We try to avoid the unreliable optimism of 
some competitors. Full year traffic will grow 8% to 153m but we expect a slightly better fare environment 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report
than last winter (although we have limited H2 visibility). This however remains sensitive to any market 
uncertainty such as a 'no deal' Brexit. We expect ancillary revenues will grow ahead of traffic growth, 
supporting full-year revenue per guest growth of 2% to 3%. The full year fuel bill will rise by EUR450m 
and ex-fuel unit costs will increase by 2%. While Lauda's losses will be higher than originally expected, 
due to overcapacity in Austria and Germany, traffic will be higher as we take advantage of the 
availability of low cost A320 leases. We are therefore narrowing our full year guidance to a new range of 
EUR800m to EUR900m PAT.  This guidance is heavily dependent on close in H2 fares, Brexit and the absence 
of any security events.

uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  It is not reasonably possible to itemise all of the 
many factors and specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an airline operating in the European 
economy.  Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results 
are the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for the 
replacement of aircraft, costs associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, 
U.K., European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, uncertainties 
surrounding Brexit, weather related disruptions, ATC strikes and staffing related disruptions, delays in the delivery 
of contracted aircraft, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour 
relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the UK 
and Continental Europe, the general willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social and political 
factors and unforeseen security events.

3% reduction in average fares.
   Ancillary revenues:
   Ancillary revenues rose by 29% to EUR859.8M due to 10% traffic growth and improved uptake of ancillary 
products, particularly priority boarding and reserved seating.

   Operating Expenses:
   Fuel and oil:
   Fuel and oil rose by 20% to EUR802.9M due to higher fuel prices and an 11% increase in flight hours.
   Airport and handling charges:
   Airport and handling charges increased by 9% to EUR334.7M primarily due to a 10% increase in traffic, 
new enhanced handling arrangements in Stansted, Spain & Poland and the consolidation of Lauda (only 
consolidated in late August 2018).
   Staff costs:
   Staff costs increased 14% to EUR286.0M due to 11% more flight hours, the consolidation of Lauda (only 
consolidated in late August 2018), higher crewing ratios and the annualisation of pilot pay increases.
   Route charges:
   Route charges rose 1% to EUR216.3M due to a 10% increase in sectors, offset by a decrease in unit 
rates.
   Depreciation:
   Depreciation is 15% higher at EUR188.2M due to the 29 additional B737 owned aircraft in the fleet at 
period end, the purchase of spare engines and simulators and the impact of IFRS16 (EUR15.3M), adopted from 
April 1, 2019.
   Marketing, distribution and other:
   Marketing, distribution and is flat at EUR154.5M due to lower EU261 compensation costs.
   Maintenance, materials and repairs:
   Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by 42% to EUR69.1M due to higher scheduled maintenance due 
to an ageing fleet and MAX delivery delays, costs associated with the hand back of Airbus aircraft and 
maintenance provisions for 11 additional A320 operating leases.
   Aircraft rentals:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -5-
   Aircraft rentals fell by 37% to EUR12.8M due to fewer leased B737 aircraft in the fleet compared to the 
same period last year (FY20 26, FY19 28) and the adoption of IFRS16 which is offset by higher 
depreciation.
   Unit cost per pax rose by 3% (excluding fuel they fell by 1%).
   Net finance expense:
   Net finance decreased by 9% at EUR13.1M primarily due to higher interest rates achieved on deposits and 
the re-financing of debt at lower interest rates. IFRS16 had a negative EUR1.6M impact in the quarter.

   Going concern
   Having considered the Group's principal risks and uncertainties and its financial position and cash 
flows, the Directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the interim financial statements, 
that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group as a whole have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of 
the interim financial statements. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the interim financial statements.
   Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
   Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
   Interim Financial Statements
    1.            Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
   Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The unaudited condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the half-year ended September 30, 2019 
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
   These 
unaudited 
condensed 
consolidated 
interim 
financial 
statements 
("the 
interim 
financial 
statements"), which should be read in conjunction with our 2019 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 
2019, have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial 
Reporting" as adopted by the EU ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full 
annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2019, are available at http://investor.ryanair.com/.
   The September 30, 2019 figures and the September 30, 2018 comparative figures do not constitute 
statutory financial statements of the Group within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2014. The 
consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 31, 2019, together with the 
independent auditor's report thereon, were filed with the Irish Registrar of Companies following the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -5-
Company's Annual General Meeting and are also available on the Company's Website. The auditor's report on 
those financial statements was unqualified.
   The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements for the half-year ended September 30, 2019 on November 1, 2019.
   Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
   Reclassifications
   To ensure consistency in the presentation of the condensed consolidated interim balance sheet, the 
Company has reclassified EUR102.9M in provisions from non-current liabilities to current liabilities in 
the prior period (at March 31, 2019).
   Accounting for assets held for sale
   Non-current assets are classified as held-for sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered 
primarily through sale rather than through continuing use. Such assets are generally measured at the lower 
of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses on initial classification as 
held-for-sale or held-for distribution and subsequent gains and losses on re-measurement are recognised in 
the income statement. Once classified as held-for-sale, intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment are no longer amortised or depreciated, and any equity-accounted investee is no longer equity 
accounted.
   New IFRS standards and amendments adopted during the year
   The following new and amended IFRS standards, amendments and IFRIC interpretations, have been issued by 
the IASB, and have also been endorsed by the EU. These standards are effective for the first time for the 
Group's financial year beginning on April 1, 2019 and therefore have been applied by the Group in these 
condensed consolidated interim financial statements:
    --              IFRS 16 - Leases (see below)
    --              Amendments to IFRS 9 - Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation
    --              IFRIC 23 - Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
    --              Amendments to IAS 28 - Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures
    --              Amendments to IAS 19 - Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement
    --              Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015 - 2017 Cycle - various standards
   With the exception of IFRS 16, the adoption of these new or amended standards did not have a material 
impact on the Group's financial position or results from operations in the half-year ended September 30, 
2019. The impact of adoption of IFRS 16 is set out below.
   IFRS 16 - Leases
   The Group has adopted IFRS 16 with effect from April 1, 2019.  IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance 
sheet, lease accounting model for lessees.  A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its 
right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease 
payments.

  Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
   MD&A Half-Year Ended September 30, 2019
   Income Statement
   Scheduled revenues:
   Scheduled revenues increased by 5% to EUR3,735.0M due to 11% traffic growth to 85.7M guests offset by a 5% 
reduction in average fares.
   Ancillary revenues:
   Ancillary revenues rose by 28% to EUR1,654.6M due to 11% traffic growth and improved uptake of ancillary 
products, particularly priority boarding and reserved seating.
   Total revenues:
   As a result of the above, total revenues increased by 11% to EUR5,389.6M.
   Operating Expenses:
   Fuel and oil:
   Fuel and oil rose by 22% to EUR1,586.9M due to higher fuel prices and a 12% increase in flight hours.
   Airport and handling charges:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -4-
   Airport and handling charges increased by 12% to EUR660.2M due to an 11% increase in traffic, new enhanced 
handling arrangements in Stansted, Spain & Poland and the consolidation of Lauda (only consolidated in late 
August 2018).
   Staff costs:
   Staff costs increased 18% to EUR583.3M due to 12% more flight hours, the consolidation of Lauda (only 
consolidated in late August 2018), higher crewing ratios and the annualisation of pilot pay increases.
   Route charges:
   Route charges rose by 3% to EUR426.0M due to an 11% increase in sectors, offset by a decrease in unit rates.
   Depreciation:
   Depreciation is 19% higher at EUR381.1M, due to the 29 additional B737 owned aircraft in the fleet at period end, 
the purchase of spare engines and simulators and the impact of IFRS 16 (EUR27.3M), which was adopted from 
April 1, 2019.
   Marketing, distribution and other:
   Marketing, distribution and other rose by 5% to EUR299.1M, slower than traffic growth, due to lower EU261 
compensation costs.
   Maintenance, materials and repairs:
   Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by 40% to EUR137.2M due to higher scheduled engine 
maintenance due to an ageing fleet and MAX delivery delays, costs associated with the handback of Airbus aircraft 
and maintenance provision for 11 additional A320 operating leases.
   Aircraft rentals:
   Aircraft rentals fell by 28% to EUR27.5M due to fewer leased B737 aircraft in the fleet compared to the same 
period last year (FY20 26, FY19 28) and the adoption of IFRS16 which is offset by higher depreciation.
   Unit cost per pax rose by 5%. Excluding fuel, unit costs increased by 2%, much of which was due to the absence 
of Lauda for most of H1 FY19 (consolidated in late August 2018), the handback of Airbus leases, higher crewing 
ratios and the annualisation of pilot pay increases.
   Net finance expense:
   Net finance expense decreased by 14% to EUR26.6M primarily due to higher interest rates achieved on deposits 
and the re-financing of debt at lower interest rates. IFRS16 had a negative EUR2.6M impact in the half-year.
   Balance sheet:
   Gross cash increased by EUR737.6M to EUR3,932.5M at September 30, 2019.
   Gross debt rose by EUR748.1M to EUR4,392.5M due to a new EUR750.0M low cost syndicated bank facility and 
the impact of IFRS16 (EUR227.2M), offset by EUR230.8M debt repayments.
   EUR1,077.1M net cash was generated by operating activities. Capital expenditure was EUR608.2M and 
shareholder returns amounted to EUR226.0M.
   Net debt was EUR460.0M (including EUR227.2M IFRS16 lease liability) at period end.  (March 2019: 
EUR449.5M).
   Shareholders' equity:
   Shareholders' equity increased by EUR1,142.0M to EUR6,356.9M in the period due to IFRS hedge accounting 
treatment for derivatives of EUR216.5M and consolidated profit after tax of EUR1,152.7M, offset by EUR226.0M 
shareholder returns.

Body
   The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach, under which the cumulative 
effect of initial application is recognised in retained earnings at April 1, 2019.  Accordingly, the 
comparative information presented for 2018 has not been restated - i.e. it is presented, as previously 
reported, under IAS 17 and related interpretations.  The details of the changes in accounting policies are 
disclosed below.
   As a lessee, the Group previously classified leases as operating or finance leases based on its 
assessment of whether the lease transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.  
Under IFRS 16, the Group recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases - i.e. these 
leases are on-balance sheet.
   The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for some leases of 
low-value assets and has applied the exemption not to recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for 
leases with less than 12 months of lease term.
   The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.  The 
right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the lease liability.   The 
lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the 
commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be 
readily determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental 
borrowing rate as the discount rate.
   The Group has determined the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a lessee that include 
renewal options.  The assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise such options 
impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use 
assets recognised. As at September 30, 2019, the Group's right-of-use assets relate to leased aircraft.
   The impact of the IFRS 16 transition increased non-current assets on April 1, 2019 by EUR130M, 
increased liabilities by EUR140M and reduced equity (distributable reserves) by EUR10M.
   When measuring lease liabilities for leases that were previously classified as operating leased, the 
Group has discounted lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate at April 1, 2019. The discount 
rate applied for all leases ranged between 2.5% - 3.5%.
   Impact of IFRS 16 in the half-year period:
   During the half-year ended September 30, 2019 non-current assets increased by EUR81.2M (net) and 
liabilities increased by EUR86.7M (net) due to the addition of 11 leased aircraft to the fleet.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -6-
   The Group has recognised depreciation and interest expenses instead of operating lease expenses in 
relation to those leases under IFRS 16. During the half-year ended September 30, 2019, the Group 
recognised EUR27.3M of depreciation expense and EUR2.6M of lease interest expenses from these leases in 
the condensed consolidated interim income statement.
   New IFRS standards and amendments issued but not yet effective
   The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for the purposes 
of the preparation of future financial statements, where applicable.  While under review, we do not 
anticipate that the adoption of the other new or revised standards and interpretations will have a 
material impact on our financial position or results from operations:
   --         Amendments to References to Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020)*
   --          Amendments to IFRS 3 - Definition of a Business (effective for fiscal periods beginning on 
or after January 1, 2020)*
   --         Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 - Definition of Material (effective for fiscal periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2020)*
   --           IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 
1, 2021)*
    --             Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7)*
   *These standards or amendments to standards are not as yet EU endorsed
    2.            Judgements and estimates
   The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
   In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements made 
by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty 
were the same as those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
    3.            Seasonality of operations
   The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly, 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
    4.            Income tax
   The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the half-year ended September 
30, 2019 was 8.5% (September 30, 2018: 8.9%).  The tax charge for the half-year ended September 30, 2019 
of EUR106.8M (September 30, 2018: EUR112.8M) comprises a current tax charge of EUR139.5M and a deferred 
tax credit of EUR32.7M primarily relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment 
and net operating losses.
    5.            Share based payments
   The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR4.0M in the half-year ended September 30, 2019 
(September 30, 2018: EUR5.0M) is the fair value of options granted in prior periods, which is being 
recognised within the income statement in accordance with employee services rendered.  During the period 
0.6M ordinary shares were issued at a strike price of EUR6.25 per share following the exercise of vested 
options under the 2013 options plan.
    6.            Contingencies
   The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
    7.            Capital commitments
   At September 30, 2019 the Group had an operating fleet of 455 (2018: 451) Boeing 737 and 21 (2018: 9) 
Airbus A320 aircraft. The Group has agreed to purchase up to 210 (135 firm and 75 options) Boeing 737-MAX-
200 aircraft from the Boeing Corporation during the periods FY20 to FY24.
    8.            Analysis of operating segment
   The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the Group CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). There have been no 
changes to the basis of segmentation or the measurement basis for the segment profit or loss since the 
prior year. The intent to create a new Group structure was announced in February 2019.  The Group 
currently comprises four separate airlines, Buzz, Lauda, Malta Air (established in June 2019) and Ryanair 
DAC.  While good progress has been made in developing our Group airlines, we have not yet finalised the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -6-
operational structures, the basis of allocation of capital and resources and the form and content of 
reporting of performance.
   Accordingly the Group remained managed as a single business unit and is reported as a single reportable 
segment.   We expect the implementation of the group structure will be finalised in the coming months, at 
which stage the basis of segmentation will be reviewed and updated, where necessary, in our March 31, 2020 
Annual Report.
   The CODM assessed the performance of the business based on the profit/(loss) after tax of the Group for 
the half-year.
 Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

   In FY19 the Company bought back 37.8M shares at a total cost of EUR561.0M. This buy-back was equivalent

Chief Executive
   November 1, 2019
   Independent review report to Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
   Introduction
   We have been engaged by the Company to review the condensed set of consolidated interim financial 
statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended September 30, 2019 which comprises 
the condensed consolidated interim balance sheet, the condensed consolidated interim income statement, the 
condensed consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income, the condensed consolidated interim 
statement of cash flows, and the condensed consolidated interim statement of changes in shareholders' 
equity and the related explanatory notes. Our review was conducted having regard to the Financial 
Reporting Council's ("FRCs") International Standard on Review Engagements ("ISRE") (UK and Ireland) 2410, 
'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity'.
   Conclusion
   Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set 
of consolidated interim financial statements in the half-yearly report for the six months ended September 
30, 2019 is not prepared in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting' as adopted by the EU, the 
Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 ("Transparency Directive"), and the Transparency 
Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland.
   Directors' responsibilities
   The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the Directors. The 
Directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the 
Transparency Directive and the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland. As disclosed in note 1, 
the annual financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and as adopted by the EU. 
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the condensed set of consolidated interim financial 
statements included in this half-yearly financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 
'Interim Financial Reporting' as adopted by the EU.
   Our responsibility
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -8-
   Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed set of consolidated 
interim financial statements in the half-yearly financial report based on our review.
   Scope of review
   We conducted our review having regard to the Financial Reporting Council's International Standard on 
Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity.  A review of interim financial information consists of making 
enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical 
and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance 
that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion.
   We read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of consolidated interim financial statements and 
to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the review. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
   The purpose of our review work and to whom we owe our responsibilities
   This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with the terms of our engagement to assist the 
Company in meeting the requirements of the Transparency Directive and the Transparency Rules of the 
Central Bank of Ireland. Our review has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company those 
matters we are required to state to it in this report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company for our 
review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have reached.

   Acquisitions and disposals
   Capital expenditure in the half-year ended September 30, 2019 amounted to EUR608.2M and primarily

    11.          Assets held for sale
   In August 2019, the Company entered into an agreement to sell 10 Boeing 737-800 aircraft for delivery 
in FY20 and FY21. Accordingly, these aircraft are presented as assets held for sale as at September 30, 
2019 and are stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
    12.          Financial instruments and financial risk management
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -7-
   The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
   These interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2019 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year.
   Fair value hierarchy
   Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
   --           Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
that the Group can access at the measurement date.
   --           Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
that asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
    --           Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
   Fair value estimation
   Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
   Financial instruments measured at fair value
   --           Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to 
determine the fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
   --           Derivatives - currency forwards and aircraft fuel contracts: A comparison of the 
contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at September 30, 2019 
has been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
   The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the half-year ended September 30, 2019, 
there were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
   Financial instruments not measured at fair value
   --           Long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at September 30, 2019 to 
arrive at a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
   There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the half-year ended 
September 30, 2019 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.
   The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial balance sheet, are as follows:
                                                   At Sep    At Sep     At Mar     At Mar

   Solid trading continues in the fourth quarter.
   Full Year Headline profit before tax expectation of GBP420m to GBP430m
   In upper half of previous guidance range
   Summary
   easyJet has delivered a solid performance in the fourth quarter with robust customer demand and the 
delivery of self-help initiatives driving outperformance in both our passenger and ancillary revenue per 
seat. Our cost performance remained strong and in line with expectations despite the difficult Q4 
disruption environment. Our operational resilience initiative was a driving force behind the strong 
performance.
   easyJet expects to deliver Full Year 2019 headline profit before tax of between GBP420 million and 
GBP430 million. This is in the upper half of the previous guidance range.
   Revenue
   Passenger(1) numbers for the full year increased by 8.6% to 96 million, driven by an increase in 
capacity(2) of 10.3% to 105 million seats. Load factor for the full year will decrease by 1.4 percentage 
points to 91.5%.
   Total revenue per seat at constant currency for the full year will decrease by circa 2.7%. Total 
revenue per seat at constant currency for the second half will increase by circa 0.8%, an outperformance 
compared to our previous guidance of 'slightly down'. The drivers of this outperformance are the yield 
optimisation self-help initiatives delivered in the fourth quarter and increased demand due to strikes at 
British Airways and Ryanair.
   Cost
   Total headline cost for the full year will increase by circa 12.0% due to increased capacity, higher 
unit fuel costs and adverse foreign exchange movements. This increase was partially offset by improvements 
in cost per seat ex fuel.
   Headline cost per seat excluding fuel at constant currency will decrease by circa 0.8% for the year, in 
line with previous guidance. Despite a difficult disruption environment experienced in the fourth quarter, 
easyJet PLC easyJet Trading Update and Pre-Close Statement
which included the impact of storms across Europe and the technical issues experienced at Gatwick airport, 
the operational resilience initiative was a key driving force behind the strong performance.
   Fuel and FX
   easyJet's total fuel cost for Full Year 2019 is expected to be around GBP1,420 million, which includes 
an adverse impact of foreign exchange and increased Emissions Trading System (ETS) costs.
   Total headline foreign exchange will have a year-on-year adverse impact of around GBP14 million.
   Forward looking
   Quarter one 2020 forward bookings(3) are currently in line with the same time last year and our 
expected capacity growth for full year 2020 will be at the lower end of our historic range. easyJet's 
scheduled year-on-year capacity growth in Q1 is currently around 2%.
   easyJet plans to provide further details on its FY20 priorities as part of the Full Year 2019 results 
announcement on Tuesday 19(th) November 2019.
   Commenting; Johan Lundgren, easyJet Chief Executive said:
   "easyJet has continued to perform in line with expectations, despite challenging market conditions.
   "As a result of our self-help initiatives and the increased demand due to disruption at British Airways 
and Ryanair, we anticipate achieving headline profit before tax for the full year 2019 of between GBP420 
million and GBP430 million, in the upper half of our previous guidance range.
   "Our implementation of initiatives in the fourth quarter to optimise yield has led to solid revenue 
performance with total revenue per seat at constant currency set to increase for the full year. We have 
continued to invest in operational resilience, with the programme successfully reducing the impact of 
disruption on our operations. As a result, we expect to report a fall in headline cost per seat for the 
year, excluding fuel at constant currency.
   "I would like to thank all our people for their continued tireless work in delivering the warmest 
welcome in the sky to all our customers."

   Whereas the 'winners' all demonstrated good 'capacity discipline', the same cannot be said of the 
'losers'. In some instances, this is a lack of industry discipline. Ryanair, for example, operates in an 
industry where short haul airline capacity has increased. This has caused pressure on ticket prices, 
squeezing revenues. Likewise, Carnival, which controls the world's largest fleet of cruise ships, operates 
in an industry where growing capacity has hurt pricing. Both Ryanair and Carnival have played a part in 
building excess supply. This is also true of Umicore, the Belgian precious metals refining and recycling 
company and Infineon (power semiconductors); their own capacity overreach has played a part in the 
deterioration of pricing conditions. This problem is compounded by companies where new capital has been 
raised to pay for big acquisitions. The most notable of these is Bayer, the German pharmaceutical, 
healthcare and agriculture technology company, which completed the $63 billion acquisition of Monsanto in 
June 2018. Another large German company, Infineon, is in the process of acquiring its rival, Cypress 
Semiconductor, for EUR 9 billion. Both stocks have been significant detractors to performance. Finally, we 
note the poor performance of shares in Arrow Global, the London listed leading European credit management 
services provider. However, the disappointing share price belies the strong operating performance of the 
company. We remain confident about the company and its prospects.
   Although portfolio turnover is lower than usual there was the usual run of mistakes. Investments in 
Bayer and Infineon have proved to be costly errors. However, we have decided to retain these investments. 
Bayer's share price has suffered unduly in the face of litigation in the U.S. involving one of the 
company's crop protection chemicals. Infineon's shares have suffered for cyclical demand reasons and 
because of the risks associated with their major acquisition. Notwithstanding these understandable 
concerns, we believe that the company's undoubted strengths should assert themselves and be recognised in 
due course. There were two significant disposals, those of Inmarsat and Ryanair. Inmarsat, the British 
satellite telecommunications company, was sold following a takeover approach. This has been a very 
disappointing investment. We misjudged the competitive environment and concomitant adverse pricing 
implications. When an offer was made for the company, we took the opportunity to sell the position. 
Ryanair, on the other hand, has been a good investment. It is Europe's leading short haul, low cost 
airline. However, we decided to sell our holding as revenues are under pressure and costs, following the 
company's decision to recognise unions, have increased markedly. We also disposed of Umicore. Its strategy 
is predicated on a swift and solid uptake of electric vehicles. However, demand for electric vehicles has 
stalled leaving Umicore with overcapacity and pricing pressure.
   There were only three new purchases of any note, the London Stock Exchange (LSE), Ubisoft and Barry 
Callebaut. The LSE continues to benefit from the regulatory driven trend to 'on exchange' trading; and it 
Jupiter European Opps. Trust PLC Annual Financial -3-
is also well placed to exploit the increasing use of data intense index businesses by customers. French 
based Ubisoft is a leading video gaming company. New technology, notably 'cloud' based technology, enables 
innovations which should improve user experiences. We believe that these better experiences will drive new 
demand. The other significant new investment was that of Barry Callebaut, the world's largest chocolate 
manufacturer. Its expertise is reflected in its growing market share and manifest in innovations such as 
ruby chocolate, the new 'fourth' chocolate.
   Outlook
   We identify a few elements in the economic backdrop which give cause for concern: anaemic economic 
growth rates, high debt levels and protectionism. Moreover, quoted companies are assailed by wider 
'stakeholder' interests that challenge business orthodoxy and explain the continuing shift in capital from 
public to private equity. The value of Initial Public Offerings declined in 2018 whereas Private equity 
fund raising increased. Notwithstanding these multifarious concerns, it is undoubtedly the case that some 
businesses will prosper. We attempt to find companies which are secular, as opposed to cyclical, winners. 
Typically, these companies have successful digital strategies, have products and services that are well 
adapted to demand trends, and have business models that escape the attention of protectionist minded 
politicians. Capital light enterprises which can succeed without recourse to major acquisitions fit our 
ideal investment criteria. Such businesses exist and are flourishing. We remain confident that our 
investment process is an appropriate one to find these winning companies.

   Stobart Group Limited
   25 September 2019
   25 September 2019
   STOBART GROUP LIMITED
   ('Stobart Group' or 'the Group')
   Trading Update
   Stobart Group, the aviation, energy and civil engineering group, has issued the following trading 
update prior to the publication of its interim results for the six months to 31 August 2019.
   The Group is trading in line with market expectations and continues to make strong commercial progress 
in its two core divisions: Aviation and Energy.
   Stobart Aviation
   Passenger numbers at London Southend Airport have increased by 42% in the six months to 31 August 2019, 
compared to the same period last year. This substantial growth was driven by the start of Ryanair flights 
in April, Loganair flights in May and the continued successful growth of easyJet.  Access was further 
improved by the introduction of early and late rail services between London Liverpool Street and Southend 
Airport.
   From October 2019, WizzAir will start flying from London Southend Airport, to three new destinations. 
These new routes will help support the continued growth in passenger numbers at London Southend Airport in 
line with the Group's target of reaching 5 million passengers per annum by February 2023. Given the 
ongoing uncertainty in the sector, in part caused by Brexit, the Group is taking a cautious approach to 
passenger forecasts in the short term, with the Board working on the basis of circa 2.3 million passengers 
for the year ending 29 February 2020. This would represent an increase of 53% versus the previous year.
   Stobart Energy
   During the period, the volume of waste managed, which is predominantly processed into waste wood fuel, 
increased by 148k tonnes to 806k tonnes. This is equivalent to a run rate of 1.7m tonnes per annum - 
representing a 22% increase on the same period last year. The continued improvement in performance is a 
result of all the energy recovery plants (except one) that Stobart Energy supplies under long term 
contracts, having reached full contractual operational volumes
   Other assets and investments
Stobart Group Limited Trading Update
   In July 2019, Connect Airways (in which Stobart Group holds a 30% interest) received merger control 
clearance from the European Commission for its acquisition of Flybe. With Connect Airways taking over full 
management control of Flybe, the leadership teams are now focused on plans to grow its regional network, 
while Stobart Air continues to expand its successful franchise business.
   Along with the industry as a whole, Stobart Rail & Civils has been affected by delays to tendering for 
works associated to Control Period 6 which commenced 1 April 2019, and the ongoing reorganisation at 
Network Rail has further impacted the pace of new contract awards compared to what we had envisaged in the 
prior period. However, we are encouraged by the overall improvement in operational performance following 
the appointment of a new management team last year. The division has been reoriented to focus on securing 
profitable new external contracts and is well placed to secure further opportunities once Control Period 6 
gathers momentum.
   Warwick Brady, CEO of Stobart Group said, "Stobart Group has made considerable progress in the period, 
particularly in terms of the number of passengers that we have welcomed at London Southend Airport and the 
volume of waste fuel that we have been in a position to supply under contract. I am particularly 
encouraged by the quality of airline partners that we are now working with and the opportunity that brings 
to deliver future sustainable operating profits."
   The Group's interim results for the six months to 31 August 2019 are scheduled to be released on 14 
November 2019.

9 September 2019
   PENNANT INTERNATIONAL GROUP PLC
   Launch of Aviation Skills Charter
   Pennant International Group plc ("Pennant", the "Group", or the "Company"), the AIM quoted supplier of 
integrated training and support solutions, products and services which train and assist operators and 
maintainers in the defence and regulated civilian sectors, is pleased to announce that on 3 September 
2019, at an event at Cranfield University, aviation and aerospace industry leaders and educators came 
together as a unified body to support the launch of a new Charter for Aviation Skills.
   The purpose of this new Charter is to create commitment and responsibility amongst key stakeholders to 
address the widely-recognised shortage of skilled people within UK aviation industry and to formulate a 
tangible, and achievable action plan to deliver more trained pilots, aircraft technicians, air traffic 
controllers and groundcrew.
   Organisations attending the Charter event comprised major OEMs, operators and educational institutions 
and included Airbus, Boeing, British Airways, Ryanair, Leonardo, Marshalls and Cranfield University.
   The Charter, which aligns with the UK Government's draft 'Aviation 2050' strategy, anticipates a multi-
faceted approach to delivering more skilled people for UK aviation, which will include the creation of 
clear pathways into aviation careers, providing a catalyst for industry and educators to establish new 
training courses and academies.
   The Charter launch was co-ordinated by the Aviation Skills Partnership, part of the Pennant Group which 
has been a driving force in tackling this widely recognised skills gap.
   John Ponsonby OBE, Chairman of ASP commented:
   "The UK needs to re-establish its place at the forefront of aviation training to meet a global skills 
gap and to sustain and grow the UK aviation and aerospace industries. Launching this Charter, with its 
associated action plan, is the first step in this critical journey."

   one AKO Fund owned 3% or more of the shares.
  As a result of a transfer of shares between two AKO Funds as at close

   Master Fund Limited now owns 3.07% of the shares and as such we are notifying
   the name of this Fund to both CBI and Ryanair.
  AKO Capital LLP's aggregate holding remains above 4% but below 5% and
   as such we understand is not required to submit a further disclosure.
  Done at London on 28 August 2019.

   STOBART GROUP LIMITED
   ('Stobart Group' or 'the Company')
   London Southend Airport signs agreement with Wizz Air
   Stobart Group, the aviation, energy and civil engineering group, is pleased to announce a new 
partnership with the largest low-cost airline in Central and Eastern Europe, Wizz Air. Wizz Air is listed 
on the London Stock Exchange as Wizz Air Holdings plc (LSE: WIZZ).
   From Thursday 22 August 2019, Wizz Air will put on sale three new routes from London Southend Airport 
to Bucharest (Romania), Sibiu (Romania), and Vilnius (Lithuania). Wizz Air will operate 14 weekly flights 
from the airport, using Airbus A320 aircraft.
   As a result of the new routes, which will start in October and November, the airport expects to welcome 
an additional 250,000 passengers in the first year of the 5-year agreement, as London Southend Airport, 
London's fastest growing airport, builds towards its target of 5 million passengers per annum by February 
2023.
   Wizz Air has joined an increasing number of operators based at London Southend Airport, including 
easyJet, Air Malta, Ryanair, Loganair and Flybe (Connect Airways). Customers now have more than 40 
domestic and European destinations from which to choose.
   Thanks to London Southend Airport's rail links, it takes just over 50 minutes for passengers to travel 
to and from London Liverpool Street, situated at the centre of the UK capital. New early and late trains 
have also been put on, with six trains per-hour at peak times.
   Warwick Brady, CEO of Stobart Group, said: "The agreement with Wizz Air is another significant 
milestone in the development of the UK's fastest-growing airport, London Southend Airport. The partnership 
increases the domestic and European destinations we can offer customers to more than 40 by adding exciting 
and increasingly popular destinations in Central and Eastern Europe.
   "Last year, we increased passenger numbers at London Southend Airport by one-third to more than 1.5 
million. This is part of our plan to become London's next big airport as we aim to hit our target of 5 
million passengers per annum by February 2023.  2019 has also seen substantial progress at London Southend 
Stobart Group Limited London Southend Airport signs Wizz Air agreement
Airport. Not only in terms of more airlines starting services, but the continued development of the 
airport's infrastructure and retail offering.
   "These improvements include new early and late trains from London Liverpool Street and enhanced food 
and beverage options in the terminal, as we build towards our target of GBP8 EBITDA per passenger.
   "We are pleased that this easy access to London continues to attract more airline partners, such as 
Wizz Air, to London Southend Airport. The frequent train services have also helped increase the growth of 
the airport, which is now seeing more than 65% of its customers travelling from the Inner London area, and 
London Southend Airport's ease-of-use and customer service has seen consumer group Which? rank it the best

another undertaking then the second option applies.
   (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person 
or legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is 
crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the 
markets get a full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting 
rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain 
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
   (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.

   29 July 2019
   RYANAIR Q1 PROFITS FALL 21% TO EUR243M DUE TO LOWER FARES,
   HIGHER FUEL & STAFF COSTS. FULL YEAR GUIDANCE UNCHANGED.
   Ryanair Holdings plc today (29 July) reported a 21% fall in Q1 profits to EUR243m. A 6% decline in ave. fare was 
offset by strong ancillary revenues and 11% traffic growth to 42m guests. Costs rose 19% as our fuel bill increased 
24% and Lauda costs were fully consolidated (but not in the prior year quarter).

  Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
   "As previously guided, Q1 profits fell 21% to EUR243m due to lower fares, higher fuel and staff costs.
   Q1 highlights include:
    --    Revenue per guest flat at EUR55 (6% lower fares offset by 14% higher ancillary rev.)
    --    Traffic up 11% to 42m guests
    --    239 new routes & 4 new bases (Bordeaux, Marseille, Southend & Berlin) launched
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
    --    Malta Air becomes the 4(th) Group airline
    --    Lauda Airbus fleet grows to 20 A320s
    --    MAX deliveries are further delayed to end of year
    --    Ryanair becomes first EU airline to publish monthly CO emissions (66g per pax/km)
    --    EUR700m share buyback commenced in May
   Revenue
   Revenues rose 11% to EUR2.3bn. A 6% decline in average fare to EUR36 stimulated 11% traffic growth to 
42m guests. The two weakest markets were Germany, where Lufthansa was allowed to buy Air Berlin and is 
selling this excess capacity at below cost prices, and the UK where Brexit concerns weigh negatively on 
consumer confidence and spending. Ancillaries, driven by strong priority boarding and preferred seats 
sales, grew 27% to EUR0.8bn. As a result, revenue per passenger ("RPP") was broadly flat at EUR55. Ryanair 
Labs continues to develop services to improve customer experience and later this year will roll-out a new 
digital platform with improved, personalised, guest offers.
   Cost Leadership
   Ryanair has the lowest unit costs of any EU airline. As expected, our Q1 fuel bill increased 24% (up 
EUR150m) due to higher prices & volume growth. Unit costs ex. fuel rose by 4%, mainly due to the 
consolidation of Lauda (not in the prior year Q1 comp.), the handback of expensive leases to Lufthansa, 
replacing them with 20 lower cost A320 operating leases, and a 21% increase in staff costs.  We continue 
to negotiate attractive growth deals as airports compete to attract Ryanair's reliable traffic growth. Our 
FY20 fuel bill is 90% hedged at $709 per tonne and 37% hedged for FY21 at $632.
   On-Time Performance ("OTP")
   Our investment in operational efficiency, including more spares, additional engineers and new improved 
handling contracts in Stansted, Spain & Poland has seen our OTP improve more than 7% points in Q1 to over 
90% (excl. ATC). In June 2018 we cancelled over 1,100 flights due to ATC strikes but this was reduced to 
just 20 cancellations in June 2019, all of which were due to ATC staff shortage delays. Regrettably, ATC 
staffing delays continue to damage the punctuality of all EU airlines, particularly at weekends. We are 
working hard to ensure our guests enjoy on-time flights and we continue to campaign with our partners in 
A4E to encourage the European Commission to take action to minimise the impact of ATC staff shortages and 
strikes on overflights.
   Boeing 737 MAX
   The delivery of our first 5 B737-MAX aircraft has been delayed from Q1 to probably January at the 
earliest (subject to EASA approval). We now expect to receive only 30 MAX deliveries in time for S.20 
(previously 58) which will cut Ryanair's S.20 growth rate from 7% to 3% (162m to approx. 157m guests in 
FY21). We have great confidence that these "gamechanger" aircraft (which have 4% more seats, but burn 16% 
less fuel and have 40% lower noise emissions) will transform our costs and our business. Due to these 
delivery delays, we will not now see these cost savings delivered until FY21.
   Balance Sheet
   Our balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry with over 60% of our fleet debt free. In May 
the Board approved a EUR700m share buyback programme and in Q1 we returned almost EUR100m to shareholders. 
Following the adoption of the new lease accounting standard (IFRS16) future operating lease obligations 
are now included on our balance sheet for the first time (adding over EUR220m to debt at June 30). Despite 
the share buyback and the impact of IFRS16, net debt was broadly flat at quarter end at EUR419m.
   Group Airlines
   In June, Malta Air became the 4(th) airline in the Ryanair Group.  This start-up will grow our Maltese 
operation from 6 to 10 based aircraft over the next 3 years. It will also operate all our French, German 
and Italian bases. This summer, Lauda is operating 20 lower cost A320s. These aircraft, coupled with other 
cost efficiencies and improving ancillary revenues will significantly lower Lauda losses in Year 2, 
despite lower fares due to excess capacity in the German and Austrian markets. Buzz, in Poland, will 
operate 7 charter and 17 scheduled aircraft this summer and continues to grow profitability in its second 
year of operations. We expect high fuel prices and overcapacity in European short-haul to lead to further 
airline failures this winter creating more growth opportunities for Ryanair's 4 airlines.
   EU's Cleanest, Greenest Airline
   In June Ryanair became the first EU airline to report monthly CO emissions. With the highest load 
factor, and one of the youngest fleets, Ryanair delivers the lowest CO per passenger/km of any major EU 
airline. Our CO emissions have been cut by 20% over the last decade and we are committed to reducing this 
by a further 10% to under 60 grams per passenger/km by 2030. In May we launched our environmental 
partnerships, where we invest in carbon offset projects in Africa, Portugal and Ireland. Ryanair paid over 
EUR540m in environmental taxes in FY19 and expects to pay over EUR630m in FY20 (up 17%).
   Board Succession
   Following Stan McCarthy's appointment as Deputy Chairman in April 2019, the Board has nominated Louise 
Phelan to take over as Senior Independent Director in Summer 2020 following the then retirement of current 
SID Kyran McLaughlin from the Board.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
   FY20 Guidance
   We continue to guide broadly flat FY20 PAT in a range of EUR750m to EUR950m.  The current weak fare 
environment has continued into Q2 and we expect H1 fares to be down approx. 6%.  With almost zero H2 
visibility, FY20 fare guidance is towards the lower end of our guided -2% to +1% range.  However, the 
strong performance of ancillaries continues to support our RPP growth of +2% to +3% (previously +2% to 
+4%).  We expect traffic to grow by 7% to over 152m, slightly less than the 153m previously guided due to 
the Boeing MAX delivery delays. Costs will increase as our fuel bill grows by EUR450m and, as previously 
guided, we expect ex-fuel unit costs will rise by just 2%.  This guidance remains heavily dependent on 
close-in Q2 fares, H2 prices, the absence of security events, and no negative Brexit developments in H2."

  Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
   MD&A Quarter Ended June 30, 2019
   Income Statement
   Scheduled revenues:
   Scheduled revenues increased by 4% to EUR1,517.4M due to 11% traffic growth to 42M offset by a 6% 
reduction in average fares.
   Ancillary revenues:
   Ancillary revenues rose by 27% to EUR795.0M due to 11% traffic growth and improved uptake of ancillary 
products, particularly priority boarding and reserved seating.
   Total revenues:
   As a result of the above, total revenues increased by 11% to EUR2,312.4M, in line with traffic growth.
   Operating Expenses:
   Fuel and oil:
   Fuel and oil rose by 24% to EUR783.9M due to higher fuel prices and a 13% increase in flight hours.
   Airport and handling charges:
   Airport and handling charges increased by 16% to EUR325.3M due to 11% higher traffic, the consolidation 
of Lauda (not in the prior year comparative) and new, enhanced, handling arrangements in Stansted, Spain 
and Poland.
   Staff costs:
   Staff costs increased 21% to EUR297.3M due to 13% more flight hours, the consolidation of Lauda (not in 
prior year comparative), higher crewing ratios, the annualisation of pilot pay increases and additional 
engineers to support growth.
   Route charges:
   Route charges rose by 6% to EUR209.6M due to a 12% increase in sectors offset by a decrease in unit 
rates.
   Depreciation:
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
   Depreciation is 23% higher at EUR192.8M, due to the 29 additional B737 owned aircraft in the fleet at 
period end, the purchase of spare engines and simulators and the impact of IFRS 16 (EUR12.7M), which was 
adopted from April 1, 2019.
   Marketing, distribution and other:
   Marketing, distribution and other rose by 12% to EUR145.5M broadly in line with traffic growth.
   Maintenance, materials and repairs:
   Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by 38% to EUR68.1M due to higher scheduled engine 
maintenance due to an ageing fleet and costs associated with the handback of leased Airbus aircraft.
   Aircraft rentals:
   Aircraft rentals fell by 18% to EUR14.7M due to 6 fewer leased B737 aircraft in the fleet compared to 
the same period last year (FY20: 20 / FY19: 26) and the positive impact of IFRS 16, which is offset by 
higher depreciation.
   Unit costs rose by 7%. Excluding fuel, unit costs increased by 4%, much of which was due to the 
consolidation of Lauda in the quarter (not in the prior year comparative), the handback of Airbus leases, 
higher crewing ratios and the annualisation of pilot pay increases.
   Net finance expense:
   Net finance expense decreased by 19% to EUR13.5M primarily due to higher interest rates on deposits and 
the re-financing of debt at lower interest rates. IFRS 16 had a negative EUR1M impact in the quarter.
   Balance sheet:
   Gross cash increased by EUR920.9M to EUR4,115.8M at June 30, 2019.
   Gross debt rose by EUR890.7M to EUR4,535.1M due to a new EUR750M low cost syndicated bank facility and 
the impact of IFRS 16 (EUR223.0M), offset by EUR79.6M of debt repayments.
   EUR748.0M net cash was generated by operating activities. Capital expenditure was EUR389.5M and 
shareholder returns amounted to EUR97.2M.
   Net debt was EUR419.3M (including EUR223M IFRS 16 lease liability) at period end.  (March 2019: 
EUR449.5M).
   Shareholders' equity:
   Shareholders' equity increased by EUR65.0M to EUR5,279.9M in the period due to IFRS hedge accounting 
treatment for derivatives of EUR76.7M and consolidated profit after tax of EUR242.9M, offset by EUR97.2M 
shareholder returns.

financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2018, are available at http://investor.ryanair.com/.
   The June 30, 2019 figures and the June 30, 2018 comparative figures do not constitute statutory 
financial statements of the Group within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2014. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 31, 2018, together with the independent 
auditor's report thereon, were filed with the Irish Registrar of Companies following the Company's Annual 
General Meeting and are also available on the Company's Website. The auditor's report on those financial 
statements was unqualified.
   The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 on July 26, 2019.
   Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
   Accounting for Investment in associates
   An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence.  Significant influence is 
the power to participate in the financial and operating decisions of the entity, but is not control over 
these policies. The Company's investment in associates was accounted for using the equity method.  The 
consolidated income statement reflects the Company's share of profit/losses after tax of the associate.  
Investments in associates are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at cost adjusted for post-
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
acquisition changes in the Company's share of net assets, less any impairment in value.  If necessary, any 
impairment losses on the carrying amount of the investment in the associate are reported within the 
Company's share of equity accounted investments results in the consolidated income statement.  If the 
Company's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the associate, the carrying amount is reduced to 
nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has incurred 
obligations in respect of the associate.
   Accounting for business combinations
   Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method from the date that control is 
transferred to the Group. Under the acquisition method, consideration transferred is measured at fair 
value on the acquisition date, as are the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
   When the initial values of assets and liabilities in a business combination have been determined 
provisionally, any subsequent adjustments to the values allocated to the identifiable assets and 
liabilities (including contingent liabilities) are made within twelve months of the acquisition date and 
presented as adjustments to the original acquisition accounting.  Acquisition related costs are expensed 
in the period incurred.
   Accounting for subsidiaries
   Subsidiaries are all entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed 
to (has rights to) variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power over the entity.
   The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year are included in the Group Income 
Statement from the date at which control of the entity was obtained. They continue to be included in the 
Group Income Statement until control ceases.
   Accounting for revenues
   Scheduled revenues comprise the invoiced value of airline and other services, net of government taxes. 
Revenue from the sale of flight seats is recognised in the period in which the service is provided. 
Unearned revenue represents flight seats sold but not yet flown and a provision for government tax refund 
claims attributable to unused tickets, and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Revenue, 
net of government taxes, is released to the income statement as passengers fly. Unused tickets are 
recognised as revenue on a systematic basis, such that twelve months of time expired revenues are 
recognised in revenue in each fiscal year.
   Ancillary revenues are recognised in the income statement in the period the ancillary services are 
provided.
   Accounting for assets held for sale
   Non-current assets are classified as held-for sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered 
primarily through sale rather than through continuing use. Such assets are generally measured at the lower 
of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses on initial classification as 
held-for-sale or held-for distribution and subsequent gains and losses on re-measurement are recognised in 
the income statement. Once classified as held-for-sale, intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment are no longer amortised or depreciated, and any equity-accounted investee is no longer equity 
accounted.

    13.          Shareholder returns
   In the quarter ended June 30, 2019 the Company bought back 8.4M ordinary shares at a total cost of 
EUR97M. This buy-back was equivalent to approximately 0.7% of the Company's issued share capital at March 
31, 2019.  All of these ordinary shares repurchased were cancelled.
   In FY19 the Company bought back 37.8M shares at a total cost of EUR561M.  This buy-back was equivalent 
to approximately 3.2% of the Company's issued share capital at March 31, 2018.  All of these repurchased 
ordinary shares were cancelled at March 31, 2019.
   As a result of the share buybacks in the quarter ended June 30, 2019, share capital decreased by 8.4M 
ordinary shares (37.8M ordinary shares in the year ended March 31, 2019) with a nominal value of EUR0.1M 
(EUR0.2M in the year ended March 31, 2019) and the other undenominated capital reserve increased by a 
corresponding EUR0.2M (EUR0.2M in the year ended March 31, 2019). The other undenominated capital reserve 
is required to be created under Irish law to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
    14.          Related party transactions
   The Company's related parties comprise its subsidiaries, Directors and senior key management personnel. 
All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
   There were no related party transactions in the quarter ended June 30, 2019 that materially affected 
the financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no changes in 
the related party transactions described in the 2018 Annual Report that could have a material effect on 
the financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.
    15.          Post balance sheet events
   Between July 1, 2019 and July 25, 2019 the Company bought back 3.9M ordinary shares at a total cost of

   The following new and amended IFRS standards, amendments and IFRIC interpretations, have been issued by 
the IASB, and have also been endorsed by the EU. These standards are effective for the first time for the 
Group's financial year beginning on April 1, 2019 and therefore have been applied by the Group in these 
condensed consolidated interim financial statements:
    --             IFRS 16 - Leases (see below)
    --             IFRIC 23 - Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
    --             Amendments to IAS 28 - Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures
    --             Amendments to IAS 19 - Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement
    --             Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015 - 2017 Cycle - various standards
   With the exception of IFRS 16, the adoption of these new or amended standards did not have a material 
impact on the Group's financial position or results from operations in the quarter ended June 30, 2019. 
The impact of adoption of IFRS 16 is set out below.
   IFRS 16 - Leases
   The Group has adopted IFRS 16 with effect from April 1, 2019.  IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance 
sheet, lease accounting model for lessees.  A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its 
right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease 
payments.
   The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach, under which the cumulative 
effect of initial application is recognised in retained earnings at April 1, 2019.  Accordingly, the 
comparative information presented for 2018 has not been restated - i.e. it is presented, as previously 
reported, under IAS 17 and related interpretations.  The details of the changes in accounting policies are 
disclosed below.
   As a lessee, the Group previously classified leases as operating or finance leases based on its 
assessment of whether the lease transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.  
Under IFRS 16, the Group recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases - i.e. these 
leases are on-balance sheet.
   The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for some leases of 
low-value assets and has applied the exemption not to recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for 
leases with less than 12 months of lease term.
   The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.  The 
right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the lease liability.   The 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -5-
lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the 
commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be 
readily determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental 
borrowing rate as the discount rate.
   The Group has applied judgement to determine the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a 
lessee that include renewal options.  The assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to 
exercise such options impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities 
and right-of-use assets recognised.
   The impact of the IFRS 16 transition increased non-current assets on April 1, 2019 by EUR130M, 
increased liabilities by EUR140M and reduced equity (and distributable reserves) by EUR10M. During quarter 
ended June 30, 2019 non-current assets increased by EUR86M and non-current liabilities increased by EUR83M 
due to the addition of 12 operating lease aircraft to the fleet.

  New IFRS standards and amendments adopted in the comparative financial year
   IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 were adopted for the first time in the comparative financial year ended March 31, 
2019. Changes to significant accounting policies arising from the adoption of these new standards, 
together with the impact of adoption, are described below:
   IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers
   The Group adopted IFRS 15 with effect from April 1, 2018. The standard establishes a five-step model to 
determine when to recognise revenue and at what amount. Revenue is recognised when the good or service has 
been transferred to the customer and at the amount to which the entity expects to be entitled.
   The impact of initially applying the standard is mainly attributed to certain ancillary revenue streams 
where the recognition of revenue is deferred under IFRS 15 to the flight date where it was previously 
recognised on the date of booking.  For the majority of our revenue, the manner in which we previously 
recognised revenue is consistent with the requirements of IFRS 15.  The change in the timing of ancillary 
revenue recognition means that an increased amount of revenue will be recognised in the first half of the 
year under IFRS 15, with less revenue recognised in the second half of the year, particularly in Quarter 
4.
   The Group adopted IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method (without practical expedients), with the 
effect of initially applying this standard recognised at the date of initial application (i.e. April 1, 
2018). The impact on transition to IFRS 15, was a reduction in retained earnings (net of tax) of EUR249M 
at April 1, 2018.
   IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments
   The Group adopted IFRS 9 with effect from April 1, 2018 and has not restated comparative information.  
The standard introduces a new model for the classification and measurement of financial assets, a new 
impairment model based on expected credit losses and a new hedge accounting model to more closely align 
hedge accounting with risk management strategy and objectives. This standard replaces IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
   Financial assets, excluding derivatives, are accounted for at amortised cost, fair value through other 
comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss depending on the nature of the contractual cash 
flows of the asset and the business model in which it is held. Accordingly, no transition adjustment to 
carrying values arose in the year ended March 31, 2019. Neither was there a material increase in 
provisions as a result of applying the new expected loss impairment model to our financial assets as a 
result of adoption of IFRS 9 in the year ended March 31, 2019.  All of Ryanair's financial assets continue 
to be held at amortised cost.  The Group has not elected to adopt the new general hedge accounting model 
in IFRS 9.
   New IFRS standards and amendments issued but not yet effective
   The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for the purposes 
of the preparation of future financial statements, where applicable.  While under review, we do not 
anticipate that the adoption of the other new or revised standards and interpretations will have a 
material impact on our financial position or results from operations:
   --             Amendments to References to Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020)*
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -5-
   --             Amendments to IFRS 3 - Definition of a Business (effective for fiscal periods beginning 
on or after January 1, 2020)*
   --             Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 - Definition of Material (effective for fiscal periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2020)*
   --             IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after 
January 1, 2021)*
   *These standards or amendments to standards are not as yet EU endorsed
    2.            Judgements and estimates
   The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
   In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements made 
by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty 
were the same as those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
    3.            Seasonality of operations
   The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly, 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
    4.            Income tax expense
   The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 
2019 was 7.4% (June 30, 2018: 10.5%).  The tax charge for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 of EUR19.4M 
(June 30, 2018: EUR36.2M) comprises a current tax charge of EUR27.5M, a deferred tax credit of EUR8.1M 
primarily relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment and net operating 
losses.
    5.            Share based payments
   The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR2.5M in the quarter ended June 30, 2019 (June 30, 
2018: EUR2.5M) is the fair value of options granted in prior periods, which is being recognised within the 
income statement in accordance with employee services rendered.

   The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
    7.            Capital commitments
   At June 30, 2019 the Group had an operating fleet of 455 (2018: 431) Boeing 737 and 20 (2018: Nil) 
Airbus A320 aircraft. The Group has agreed to purchase up to 210 (135 firm and 75 options) Boeing 737-MAX-

under the Company's share option schemes and the weighted average number of shares includes weighted

    10.          Property, plant and equipment
   Acquisitions and disposals
   Capital expenditure in the period ended June 30, 2019 amounted to EUR389.6M and primarily relates to 
aircraft pre-delivery deposits, spare engines, simulators and heavy maintenance checks.
    11.          Assets held for sale
   In June 2019, management committed to sell 10 of the Company's oldest Boeing 737-800 aircraft. 
Accordingly, these aircraft are presented as assets held for sale as at June 30, 2019. Efforts to sell 
these aircraft have started and the disposal is expected to be completed over the coming months. At June 
30, 2019, these assets are stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
    12.          Financial instruments and financial risk management
   The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
   These interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2018 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year.
   Fair value hierarchy
   Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
   --          Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
that the Group can access at the measurement date.
   --          Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
that asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
    --          Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
   Fair value estimation
   Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
   Financial instruments measured at fair value
   --          Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to 
determine the fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
   --          Derivatives - currency forwards and aircraft fuel contracts: A comparison of the contracted 
rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at June 30, 2019 has been used to 
establish fair value. (Level 2)
   The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the quarter ended June 30, 2019, there 
were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -6-
   Financial instruments not measured at fair value
   --          Long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at June 30, 2019 to arrive at 
a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
   There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the quarter ended 
June 30, 2019 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.
   The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial balance sheet, are as follows:
                                                          At Jun      At Jun         At Mar      At Mar

   16 July 2019
    RYANAIR EXPECTS BOEING MAX DELIVERY DELAYS TO SLOW CAPACITY GROWTH FOR WINTER 2019 AND SUMMER 2020
   Ryanair Holdings Plc today (Tues, 16 July) updated investors on the current uncertainty over the Boeing 
737 MAX deliveries during Winter '19 and Summer '20.
   Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said:
   "Ryanair remains committed to the B737 MAX aircraft, and now expects that it will return to flying 
service before the end of 2019, however the exact date of this return remains uncertain. Boeing is hoping 
that a certification package will be submitted to regulators by September with a return to service shortly 
thereafter. We believe it would be prudent to plan for that date to slip by some months, possibly as late 
as December. As Ryanair have ordered the Boeing MAX200s, which are a variant of the MAX aircraft, these 
need to be separately certified by the FAA and EASA. Ryanair expects that the MAX200 will be approved for 
flight services within 2 months of the MAX return to service.
   Accordingly, Ryanair now hopes to receive its first MAX200 aircraft sometime between January and 
February 2020. Since Ryanair can only take delivery of between 6 to 8 new aircraft each month, we are now 
planning our summer 2020 schedules based on taking up to 30 B737 MAX aircraft deliveries up to end of May 
2020. This is less than the 58 MAX aircraft Boeing originally scheduled to deliver for our summer 2020 
schedule. This number could rise, or fall further, depending on when the B737 MAX actually returns to 
flight services.
   For planning purposes, Ryanair will now revise its summer 2020 schedule based on 30 incremental 
aircraft, rather than 58. This will cut Ryanair's summer 2020 growth rate from 7% to 3%, and means full 
year traffic growth for the year to March 2021 will be cut from 162m guests to approx. 157m. This 
shortfall in aircraft deliveries will necessitate some base cuts and closures for summer 2020, but also 
for the winter 2019 schedule. We are starting a series of discussions with our airports to determine which 
of Ryanair's underperforming or loss making bases should suffer these short term cuts and/or closures from 
November 2019. We will also be consulting with our people and our unions in planning and implementing 
these base cuts and closures, which are directly caused by the B737 MAX delivery delays to the B737 MAX 
program.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR EXPECTS B737 MAX DELAYS TO SLOW S20 GROWTH
   Ryanair will continue to work with Boeing and EASA to recover these delivery delays during the winter 
of 2020, so that we can restore our growth to normal levels in summer 2021".

   J D WETHERSPOON PLC
   PRE-CLOSE TRADING STATEMENT
   J D Wetherspoon plc (the "Company") today announces its pre-close trading statement for the financial 
year ending 28 July 2019. The preliminary results are due to be announced on 13 September 2019.
   Current trading
   For the 10 weeks to 7 July 2019 like-for-like sales increased by 6.9% and total sales increased by 
6.6%. Year-to-date like-for-like sales have increased by 6.7% and total sales increased by 7.4%.
   Property
   Since the start of the financial year, the Company has opened five new pubs and disposed of nine. No 
further openings are expected in the current financial year.
   At this stage, about GBP3m of exceptional, non-cash losses are expected in this financial year, mainly 
a result of pub disposals which were below the value in our balance sheet.
   In the current financial year to date, the Company has spent GBP71m on buying the freeholds of pubs of 
which it was previously the tenant and has bought back GBP5.4m of the Company's shares.
   Financial position
   The Company remains in a sound financial position. Net debt at the end of this financial year is 
expected to be about GBP745m.
   Outlook
   The chairman of Wetherspoon, Tim Martin, said:
   "The main issue for shareholders, which dominates debate, relates to the nature of the UK's post-Brexit 
relationship with the EU.
   "The dichotomy between a 'no-deal' Brexit and a 'deal', as it is often portrayed in the media, politics 
and business, is highly misleading. The term no-deal really means 'multi-deal' - a multitude of deals 
agreed between individuals, businesses, governments and other organisations.
   In contrast the term 'deal' refers to a 'mono-deal' - a single overarching agreement, which aims to 
govern the entire relationship between the UK and the EU.
Wetherspoon (JD) PLC Trading Statement
   "In reality, a multi-deal Brexit (ie no-deal) is already proceeding at pace. Jean Marc Puissesseau, the 
boss of the port of Calais, has said "there will not be any delay" in Calais (appendix 1). Ryanair has 
said that fears about planes not flying post-Brexit "is no longer a risk" (appendix 2). British Airways 
agrees.
   "Wetherspoon, for example, has made arrangements to replace French champagne and brandy, and German 
beer, with alternatives from the UK, Australia and America. In addition, most spirits and beer exports to 
the EU from non-EU countries are not subject to tariffs, in any event.
   "Initial fears about huge post-referendum job losses in the City of London have proved to be wide of 
the mark, as legal and practical arrangements have been made, as indicated in the article by Reuters 
(appendix 3) below.
   "These sorts of deals and arrangements are the tip of a giant iceberg of similar transactions, across 
the trading spectrum, negotiated and facilitated by individuals, businesses and civil servants - the 
negative undertone of no-deal is an illusion.
   "The real issue for the UK relates to the desirability of an overarching mono-deal, governing all 
aspects of the UK's future relationship with the EU, as envisaged in Theresa May's withdrawal agreement.
   "The multi-deal approach, which immediately allows the UK to trade freely with the rest of the world, 
is a better alternative. As the House of Lords said in March 2017, there is then no legal liability to 
make any payments to the EU.
   "It enables the UK to regain control of fishing and to eliminate tariffs on thousands of non-EU 
imports, such as bananas, rice, wine and children's clothes - many of which are not produced in the UK.
   "Democratic accountability will also be improved - the most important determinant of economic success.
   "A complex and overarching mono-deal, agreed under duress, is unnecessary and counterproductive. It 
would reduce the flexibility of UK businesses and Parliament in the future. The multi-deal approach is 
simpler, safer and will yield immediate dividends.
   "As regards Wetherspoon, the Company's expectation for our annual results is unchanged for the current 
financial year."
   Appendix 1 - Extract from Reuters, Jonathan Saul, 9 January 2019
   "Calais port boss expects little disruption from a no-deal Brexit
   Britain leaving the European Union without an agreement over its future relationship with the bloc will 
not create delays at the French port of Calais, the port's chief said on Wednesday, despite concerns 
raised over potential logistical chaos.
   Dover is Britain's main gateway to Europe, with up to 16,000 trucks a day passing through to Calais at 
peak times, transporting everything from perishable food to medicines and industrial goods needed to keep 
factories running.
   Jean-Marc Puissesseau, president and chief executive of Port Boulogne Calais, told the BBC's Today 
programme that the port "will be ready" on March 29, the date when Britain will leave the EU if no 
agreement is reached.
    "The trucks will be passing as they are doing today," he said. "There will not be any delay."   "
   Appendix 2 - Extract from Reuters Business News, Sarah Young, 21 November 2018
   "Ryanair says not seeing any Brexit impact, well-prepared for no-deal
   Europe's biggest low cost airline Ryanair is not seeing any impact from Brexit on demand for flights, 
and is prepared for a no-deal, chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said.
   Ryanair was not interested in buying British regional airline Flybe , which put itself up for sale last 
week, he added in a press conference on Wednesday.
   He reiterated comments that Ryanair, which has been hit by a series of strikes this year, would come to 
agreements with unions in its main markets before the end of March.
   The comments on Brexit from the Irish airline echo what smaller British rival easyJet said on Tuesday, 
about it being prepared for a no-deal scenario, and the uncertainty over Britain's future relationship 
with the European Union having no impact on ticket sales.
   "The demand that's out there...is really, really strong. The European consumer, the British consumer 
just continues to book," Jacobs said.
   Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary has in the past warned that a disorderly Brexit could ground 
flights for a number of weeks after the UK leaves on March 29, but after reassurances on flying rights 
provided by the EU last week, that is no longer a risk, said Jacobs.
   "If we're in a no-deal Brexit situation, flying will be fine," he said. "
   Appendix 3 - Reuters, Andrew MacAskill, Simon Jessop, Carolyn Cohn, 26 September 2018
   "With six months to go before Brexit, 630 finance jobs have left - Reuters survey
   As few as 630 UK-based finance jobs have been shifted or created overseas with just six months to go 
before Brexit, a far lower total than banks said could move after Britain's surprise vote to leave the 
European Union, according to a new Reuters survey.
   Many bankers and politicians predicted after the June 2016 referendum that leaving the EU would prompt 
a mass exodus of jobs and business and deal a crippling blow to London's position in global finance.
Wetherspoon (JD) PLC Trading Statement
   But as Brexit Day nears, the number of jobs that UK-based financial institutions say they expect to 
move in the event of a "hard" Brexit was around 5,800, just 500 more than the last survey in March, and 
with more firms responding. That compares to around 10,000 in the first survey in September 2017.
   The results are based on answers from 134 of the biggest or most internationally-focused banks, 
insurers, asset managers, private equity firms and exchanges to a survey conducted by between Aug. 1 and 
Sept. 15.
   Nearly all of those surveyed said they are moving as few people as possible, hoping for a last-minute 
political deal that protects access to the EU's $19.7 trillion-a-year economy after Britain leaves the 
bloc.
   The likelihood of a "hard" or "no-deal" Brexit has increased substantially since Prime Minister Theresa 
May's plan for maintaining ties with the EU has been rejected by Brussels as well as by many politicians 
in her own Conservative Party.
   Many business chiefs fear Britain could be heading for a chaotic split that would spook financial 
markets and dislocate trade flows across Europe and beyond. Some politicians on both sides put the odds of 
talks collapsing at more than 50 percent.
   The survey findings suggest London, which has been a critical artery for the flow of money around the 
world for centuries, is likely to remain the world's largest centre of international finance. While New 
York is by some measures bigger, it is more centred on American markets, while London focuses on 
international trade.
   Extreme forecasts for UK job losses in a hard Brexit scenario have ranged from about 30,000 roles, 
estimated by the Brussels-based Bruegel research group in February 2017, to as many as 232,000 by the 
London Stock Exchange in January 2017.
   Iain Anderson, the executive chairman of Cicero, a public affairs company, which represents many 
finance companies, agreed with the survey findings that the impact of Brexit is likely to be much more 
modest than initially predicted.
   Anderson said early estimates were made by executives in a period of unprecedented emotional turmoil 
following the vote.
   "They have now moved through the five stages of grief," he told Reuters.
   Bankers Bluff?
   Ninety-seven of the companies that responded said they would have to move staff or restructure their 
businesses because of Brexit, although only 63 specified numbers. The rest said it would have no impact, 
that they were still deciding what to do or they declined to comment.
   HSBC, which has publicly said up to 1,000 jobs could move to Paris, has so far not moved any staff, a 
source at the bank told Reuters as part of the survey. Royal Bank of Scotland, which expects to move 150 
to Amsterdam, also has not moved any employees, an RBS source said.
   Many other large international banks said in the survey that although they have moved or hired a small 
number of staff in European cities, they are aiming to shift as few jobs as possible and will take 
decisions about staff redeployment over several years.

   RYANAIR'S CO(2) EMISSIONS FOR JUNE AT JUST 66G PER PASSENGER/KM
   RYANAIR TO PAY OVER EUR630M IN ENVIRONMENTAL TAXES IN 2019 (+17%)
   Ryanair today (4 July) released its June CO(2) emissions statistics, which show an ave. of 66g CO(2) per 
passenger/km.
                          June 2019

                          -----------
  Ryanair is also publishing details of the environmental taxes it will pay in 2019 in order to dispel the myth that 
aviation does not pay environmental taxes. Over EUR540m in environmental taxes were paid in 2018 (FY19) and 
Ryanair expects this to rise to EUR630m in 2019 (FY20). This is EUR4.12 per passenger or 11% of Ryanair's 
average ticket price.

  Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
   "Ryanair is Europe's greenest/cleanest major airline with the youngest fleet and highest load factors. 
Our CO(2) per passenger/km for June 2019 is 66g, almost half the rate of other flag carrier European 
airlines. We are also publishing our environmental taxes to dispel the myth that airlines pay no 
environmental taxes. Ryanair paid over EUR540m in environment taxes in 2018 and will pay over EUR630m in 
2019 (up 17%). This equates to EUR4.12 per passenger, which is 11% of Ryanair's average air fare.
   As part of Ryanair's environmental commitment, we are investing over US$20 billion in a fleet of 210 
new Boeing 737 "gamechanger" aircraft, which will carry 4% more passengers but reduce fuel burn by 16% and 
cut noise emissions by 40%."

   Ryanair Holdings plc
   Buyback Programme Update
   In May 2019, Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") announced that it had entered into arrangements with its 
brokers, Citigroup Global Markets Limited ("Citigroup") and J&E Davy ("Davy"), to commence a share buy-back 
programme to repurchase on its behalf, ordinary shares of EUR0.006 each (the "Shares"), including Shares 
underlying American Depositary Shares, during the period commencing on 21 May 2019 and, subject to market 
conditions, ending not later than 20 May 2020.
   Ryanair today (Weds 26 June 2019) advises that it is amending the terms of the arrangements to allow for Shares 
to be repurchased by way of block trades from EU holders of Shares.  Any such block repurchases from UK holders 
of Shares will, in the event of a no-deal or "hard" Brexit, limit the proportionate number of Shares held by or on 
behalf of non-EU shareholders and should therefore reduce the period that the resolutions announced by the 
Company on 11 March 2019 would need to remain in place.
   The maximum consideration payable by the Company in respect of repurchases of Shares and Shares underlying 
American Depositary Shares under the updated arrangements remain unchanged at EUR700 million.  The timing, 
the actual number of Shares repurchased and the split between Shares and Shares underlying American 
Depositary Receipts repurchased will be dependent on market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements.

   Ryanair Holdings PLC
   11 June 2019
   RYANAIR TO INVEST IN A MALTA AOC
   THROUGH PURCHASE OF MALTA AIR
   Ryanair Holdings, Europe's largest airline group, today (11(th) June) announced it has agreed to 
purchase Malta Air, a Maltese start up airline, into which Ryanair will move and grow its Malta based 
fleet of 6 B737 aircraft.
   This investment in Malta Air will allow Ryanair to grow its already sizable presence in Malta (3m 
customers p.a.), and access non-EU markets (North Africa) from Malta. Completion is planned for the end of 
June, following which Ryanair Holdings will;
    --   Switch 6 Malta based aircraft (worth over $600m) onto the Maltese register
    --   200 Malta based crew move onto local contracts paying local Maltese taxes
    --   Increase its Malta based fleet to 10 aircraft within three years and create over 350 jobs
    --   Brand its Malta based fleet in Malta Air colours (see attached) for Summer 2020
   --   Move Ryanair based aircraft from France, Italy and Germany onto the Malta AOC which will allow 
these crews to pay their income taxes locally in France, Italy and Germany instead of Ireland where they 
are currently required to pay income taxes under Ryanair's Irish AOC.
   Speaking in Malta today, Ryanair CEO, Michael O'Leary said:
   "Ryanair is pleased to welcome Malta Air to the Ryanair Group of airlines which now includes Buzz 
(Poland), Lauda (Austria), Malta Air, and Ryanair (Ireland).
   Malta Air will proudly fly the Maltese name and flag to over 60 destinations across Europe and North 
Africa as we look to grow our Maltese based fleet, routes, traffic and jobs over the next three years.
   Ryanair's continued partnership with the Malta Tourism Authority will help drive forward the vision of 
Prime Minister Muscat and Minister Mizzi to grow year round connections to all corners of Europe which 
will support increased tourism, business and jobs in Malta.
   Ryanair appreciates the expertise of the Maltese Civil Aviation Directorate (CAD) in licencing Malta 
Air to operate the B737 aircraft and we look forward to working closely with the Maltese authorities over 
the coming years as we hope to add over 50 more aircraft to the Maltese register."
   Malta Minister for Tourism, Konrad Mizzi, said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR TO INVEST IN MALTA AOC
   "The relationship between Ryanair and Malta has evolved into a successful collaboration. We welcome 
Ryanair's commitment to operate and grow a fully fledged Malta-based airline which will contribute in a 
large way to the country's development."

   Ryanair Holdings PLC
   05 June 2019
   RYANAIR BECOMES FIRST EU AIRLINE TO REPORT MONTHLY CO(2) EMISSIONS
   AVERAGE CO(2) IN MAY OF JUST 66G, ALMOST 50% LOWER THAN OTHER MAJOR EU AIRLINES
   Ryanair today (5 June) becomes the first EU airline to release monthly CO(2) emissions statistics, which show an 
average of 66g CO(2) per passenger/km in May 2019.
 Metrics                  May 2019
  Total Kilometres         17,529m km
  Total Passengers         14.1m
  Total CO(2) Emissions    1,157 kt
  CO(2) Per Pax/km         66g
  With the highest passenger load factor (96%) and one of the youngest fleets (ave. of 6 years), Ryanair 
delivers the lowest CO(2) per passenger/km in the EU airline industry. Its current average CO(2) per 
pax/km of 67g p.a is substantially lower than its EU competitors, and Ryanair has committed to reducing 
this further to under 60g per pax/km by 2030 -- as outlined in its Environmental Policy (click here). 
Ryanair's CO(2) per pax/km has been cut from 82g to 67g (-18%) over the last decade while high fare 
competitors such as Lufthansa, BA and AF-KLM currently generate over 120g per pax/km.
   Ryanair's environmental commitment includes an investment of over US$20 billion in a fleet of 210 new 
Boeing 737 "gamechanger" aircraft, delivered between 2019 and 2024, which will carry 4% more passengers, 
but with 16% lower fuel burn and 40% lower noise emissions.
   CO(2) per passenger/km is the most transparent way to accurately measure every airline operating in 
Europe. Ryanair will publish its monthly CO(2) emissions to show its environmental commitment and calls on 
all other EU airlines to do the same.
   Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair is 1st Eu Airline to Report Monthly Co2
   "Ryanair is Europe's greenest/cleanest airline. We have the youngest fleet and highest load factors, so 
our CO(2) per passenger/km is 67g p.a (almost half the rate of other big European airlines). Over the past 
decade Ryanair's CO(2) per passenger/km has been cut by 18% from 82g to 67g, while competitors such as 
Lufthansa, BA and AF-KLM currently generate over 120g per passenger/km.
   As part of Ryanair's environmental commitment, we will invest over US$20 billion in a fleet of 210 new 
Boeing 737 "gamechanger" aircraft, which will carry 4% more passengers but reduce fuel burn by 16% and cut 
noise emissions by 40%.
   Editor's note:
   It is important to highlight that external factors substantially increase EU airline CO(2) emissions. 
Air Traffic Control (ATC) strikes and staff shortages are forcing airlines to fly longer distances which 
burn unnecessary additional fuel. These avoidable inefficiencies could be removed by reforming the 
European ATC system as recently recommended by the European Commission Wise Persons Group.

  Expanding Network
   During 2019, we maintained our leadership position in the CEE market, and continued to take advantage of 
valuable market opportunities beyond CEE. Our new base in Vienna opened in June 2018 with five based aircraft. 
In addition, we started operations to two new destinations in CEE (Tallinn in Estonia and Kharkiv in Ukraine), as 
well as from five new destinations across Western Europe and Northern Africa.
   As at today, Wizz Air offers services from 23 CEE countries including the 11 CEE countries where we have based 
aircraft and crews. During the year, the Company started operations to/from 7 new airports, as follows:

  Fleet development
   During the 2019 financial year, we continued to invest significantly in our fleet by adding twelve A321ceo, five 
A320ceo and two A321neo aircraft, taking our fleet to 112 aircraft at the end of March 2019. Deliveries of the 
A321ceo aircraft commenced in November 2015 and in just less than three years we are already operating 38 of 
the type, and in March 2019 we took delivery of the first two A321neo aircraft. Together they represent 41 per cent. 
of the Company's total seat capacity.
   The arrival of the A321neo aircraft is a game-changer for Wizz Air, as we continue to grow at an industry-leading 
rate and expand our market reach across and beyond Europe. The aircraft is powered by Pratt & Whitney GTF 
engines and features the widest single-aisle cabin with 239 seats in a single class configuration and offers Wizz Air 
maximum flexibility, fuel efficiency and low operating costs.
   The A321neo offers significant environmental benefits with nearly a 50 per cent. reduction in noise footprint 
compared to previous generation aircraft. Since entering into service in early 2016, Pratt and Whitney's GTF engine 
has demonstrated its promised ability to reduce fuel burn by 16 per cent. and nitrogen oxide emissions by 50 per 
cent.

   97% of the renewable energy plants that Stobart Energy supplies have now started commissioning and 90% have 
reached commercial operations. As a result of the improved and more consistent plant performance, Stobart 
Energy reached a year-end run rate of 1.7m tonnes per annum. The Mersey Bioenergy and Margam plants are 
expected to reach commercial operations in the near term. Port Clarence is yet to start commissioning.
   Stobart Energy is increasingly demonstrating the potential of the business model. More of the plants we supply to 
are now operating consistently, and this will relieve the cost pressures associated with maintaining the supply chain. 
Stobart Energy benefits from high-quality earnings given the long-term nature of its supply contracts and is now 
positioned to generate significant operating cashflow going forward.
   Clear targets
   The sale of Stobart Air provides an opportunity to give greater clarity to the medium-term EBITDA per passenger 
target for London Southend Airport. The February 2023 target has been updated as a result of this to GBP8 
EBITDA per passenger, made up entirely of income arising from the airport's estate. We remain confident of 
welcoming 5m passengers in the year to February 2023.
   Stobart Energy is benefitting from more consistent operations at the renewable energy plants it supplies and has 
a February 2023 target to maintain EBITDA per tonne of GBP12.
   Stobart Rail & Civils has set a five-year strategic plan to increase contracts with existing partners and external 
customers. It has a revised target to return to profitability over the medium term.
   Outlook
   We have entered the new financial year with increased confidence. We have a clear aim to develop a London 
airport that will benefit from the capacity constraints within the Capital's other airports and a highly cash generative 
Energy business with long-term contracts to supply 2m tonnes per annum.
   London Southend Airport has visibility on passenger growth following the arrival of Ryanair and Loganair flights, 
and an enhanced customer proposition that will allow non-aeronautical revenues to mature over time. Stobart 
Energy is now better positioned to maintain attractive margins and generate cash. We also have a plan in place to 
improve the performance of the Rail & Civils Division through an increased focus on securing external contracts.
Stobart Group Limited Final Results -3-
   We now have a more de-risked balance sheet having decided to impair non-core assets. We intend to now grow 
the value of our core Aviation and Energy assets and have in place an experienced commercial team with a clear 
plan to execute our strategy and deliver our targets.
   Stobart Group now intends to invest in developing a 10m+ passenger airport and the infrastructure required to 
maintain a supply chain to deliver 2m tonnes per annum of biomass fuel. The Group will also invest in core IT and 
central services, including our people while retaining an appropriate Group cost base. The majority of our 
investment will be focused on London Southend Airport and will be partly funded by the receipt of over GBP50m 
raised through the issuance of an exchangeable bond secured over our shares in Eddie Stobart Logistics plc, 
further asset sales and cash generated from operating businesses.
   By undertaking this investment in our infrastructure assets, we can generate strong and sustainable operating 
cashflows and significant long-term value for shareholders.

   (3) Includes GBP123.9m relating to the profit on disposal of associate, Eddie Stobart Logistics. Excluding this and 
the GBP4.1m profit on disposal of the hotel, the underlying EBITDA of the Investments division for 2018 would be 
GBP1.3m and the total underlying EBITDA would be GBP10.1m.
   2018 figures in the tables above are restated for discontinued operations.
   Restatement of 2018 results
   Following the disposal of Everdeal Holdings Limited on 22 February 2019 and the agreement to sell Propius 
Holdings Limited, the results of both entities have been presented within discontinued operations, net of tax below 
the (loss)/profit for the year in the consolidated income statement, for the current and prior year. Accordingly, the 
2018 results have been restated, explaining why the revenue and profitability within the Aviation segment for 2018 
is lower than reported last year.
   Underlying EBITDA
   Underlying EBITDA is the Group's key measure of profitability and has reduced by 24% to GBP10.8m, when 
excluding the GBP123.9m profit on disposal of our associate, Eddie Stobart Logistics, from the prior year.
   The Aviation division has welcomed a record number of passengers to London Southend Airport this year. 
However, overall underlying EBITDA in the division has reduced from GBP5.8m to GBP4.9m reflecting the profit on 
disposal of GBP4.1m for the hotel at London Southend Airport (LSA) in the prior year. The Energy division 
continues to deliver a strong underlying performance through increased revenue and tight cost control, increasing 
underlying EBITDA by 60% to GBP19.2m (2018: GBP12.1m). The Rail & Civils division has overcome some 
operational challenges during the year, resulting in an underlying EBITDA loss of GBP4.8m (2018: GBP4.4m profit). 
However, the management team has been strengthened and we remain positive about the future of this business.
   Central functions and eliminations costs have decreased, principally due to a reduced share-based payment 
charge following LTIP share options that lapsed during the year.
   Business segments
   The business segments reported in the financial statements are Aviation, Energy, Rail & Civils, Investments and 
Infrastructure, which represent the operational and reporting structure of the Group.
   The Investments division contains our investment in AIM-listed Eddie Stobart Logistics plc (ESL), our 30% 
investment in Connect Airways and the investment in luggage transportation company, AirportR. We received 
dividends of GBP2.7m (2018: GBP0.6m) during the year and underlying EBITDA was GBP2.4m (2018: 
GBP125.2m). The prior year results included underlying EBITDA of GBP123.9m from the profit on partial disposal 
of our holding in ESL. The fair value of our remaining holding in ESL reduced by GBP18.8m as a direct result of the 
reduction in the ESL share price. This loss is presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
   The Infrastructure division continues to realise value from property assets and generated GBP38.4m of net 
proceeds from four property sales during the year. The disposals included the sale and leaseback of the terminal 
building and office at Carlisle Lake District Airport, the sale and leaseback of a site in Widnes and the disposal of an 
asset held for sale in Lillyhall. At 28 February 2019, the book value of Infrastructure assets held was GBP82.6m 
(2018: GBP127.2m) and underlying EBITDA reduced to a GBP3.0m loss (2018: GBP3.9m profit).
   Swaps
   The impact of mark-to-market (MTM) valuations of swaps is GBP0.4m adverse in the year compared to GBP1.0m 
favourable in the prior year, mainly due to a downturn in fuel prices and currency exchange rates.
   Depreciation
Stobart Group Limited Final Results -3-
   Depreciation has increased to GBP16.3m, mainly because of additional plant and machinery and fixtures and 
fittings in the Aviation and Rail & Civils divisions.

 reported reasonable results against expectations in the recent reporting season
 and the portfolio valuation remains attractive, especially for the cyclical

OBJECTIVE AND INVESTMENT POLICY
Objective
The objective of the Company is to achieve attractive investment returns over
 the long term from a diversified portfolio of European securities.
Investment Policy
The Board believes that investment in the diverse markets of the region
 promises attractive long-term capital and income growth. It further considers
 that the structure of the Company as a UK listed investment trust, with an
 independent Board of Directors, is well suited to meeting this aim.
The Company is invested in a diversified portfolio which is expected to consist
 of approximately 30 to 50 securities. The Company may not invest more than 10%
 of the value of the portfolio in any one individual stock at the time of
 investment.
The Board recognises that investment in some European countries can be riskier
 than in others. Investment risks are diversified through holding a wide range
 of securities in different countries and industrial sectors. No more than 10%
 of the value of the portfolio in aggregate may be held in securities in those
 countries which are not included in the FTSE All-World European indices.
European Inv Tst Plc Half-year Report -3-
The Board has the authority to hedge the Company's exposure to movements in the
 rate of exchange of currencies, principally the euro, in which the Company's
 investments are denominated, against sterling, its reporting currency. However,
 it is not generally the Board's practice to do this and the portfolio is not
 currently hedged.
No investments in unquoted stocks can be made without the prior approval of the
 Board. The level of gearing within the portfolio is agreed by the Board and
 should not exceed 20% in normal market conditions.
No more than 10% of the total assets of the Company may be invested in other
 listed investment companies (including investment trusts) except in those that
 have stated that they will invest no more than 15% of their total assets in
 other listed investment companies. In this case, the limit is 15%.
The Investment Manager's compliance with the limits set out in the investment
 policy is monitored by the Board and the Alternative Investment Fund Manager
 (the "AIFM").
DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT

*  The condensed set of Financial Statements has been prepared in accordance with
    Financial Reporting Standard 104: "Interim Financial Reporting" and gives a

   Share buy-back programme
   Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") announces that it has entered into irrevocable arrangements with its 
brokers, Citigroup Global Markets Limited ("Citigroup") and J&E Davy ("Davy"), to commence a share buy-back 
programme to repurchase on its behalf, ordinary shares of EUR0.006 each (the "Shares"), including Shares 
underlying American Depositary Shares, during the period commencing on 21 May 2019 and, subject to market 
conditions, ending not later than 20 May 2020.  The purpose of the buy-back programme is to reduce the share 
capital of the Company.  Accordingly, all Shares repurchased will be cancelled.
   These arrangements are in accordance with the Company's general authority to repurchase Shares and Shares 
underlying American Depositary Shares, Chapter 9 of the Listing Rules of Euronext Dublin, the applicable laws and 
regulations of Euronext Dublin and those provisions of Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014/EU dealing with buy-
back programmes and Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
   Citigroup and/or Davy may be undertaking transactions in the Shares (which may include participation in block 
purchases) during this period in order to meet their respective obligations pursuant to this buy-back.
   The maximum consideration payable by the Company in respect of repurchases of Shares and Shares underlying 
American Depositary Shares under these arrangements is EUR700 million. The timing, the actual number of 
Shares repurchased, and the split between Shares and Shares underlying American Depositary Shares 
repurchased, will be dependent on market conditions, legal and regulatory requirements and the other terms and 
limitations contained in the arrangements.
   In light of the commencement of the above programme, the American Depositary Shares buy-back programme, 
announced on 17 February 2017, has been terminated.

   RYANAIR FULL YEAR PROFIT DOWN 29% TO EUR1.02BN ON LOWER FARES
   GUIDING FLAT GROUP PROFITS FOR THE COMING YEAR
   BOARD APPROVES EUR700M SHARE BUYBACK
   Ryanair today (20 May) reported a full year profit of EUR1.02bn (excl. Lauda). Strong traffic growth, up 7% to 
139m, was offset by a 6% decline in fares. Strong ancillary growth (+19%) was offset by higher fuel, staff and 
EU261 costs.

   Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
   "As previously guided, Ryanair (excl. Lauda) reports a full year after tax profit of EUR1.02bn.  Short-
haul capacity growth and the absence of Easter in Q4 led to a 6% fare decline, which stimulated 7% traffic 
growth to over 139m (142m guests incl. Lauda).  Ancillary sales performed strongly up 19% to EUR2.4bn, 
which drove total revenue growth of 6% to EUR7.6bn.
   FY19 highlights include:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
    --    Ave. fare fell 6% to just EUR37
    --    Traffic grew 9% to 142m (incl. Lauda)
    --    Ancillary revenue rose 19% to EUR2.4bn
    --    Yr. end fleet grew to 455 B737 & 19 A320 aircraft
    --    406 new routes and 9 new bases launched
    --    Ryanair Sun (Buzz) traded profitably in Yr.1
    --    Purchase of Lauda completed in Dec. with an exceptional Yr.1 loss of EUR139m
    --    UK AOC received in Dec.
    --    Union agreements concluded in most major markets
    --    Over EUR560m returned to shareholders via buybacks
   Revenue
   Revenues rose 6% to EUR7.6bn due to 7% higher traffic, a 6% cut in ave. fares to EUR37, while  Ryanair 
Labs continues to stimulate ancillary sales growth with spend per guest up 11% to over EUR17.  Priority 
boarding and reserved seat services grew strongly.  Ryanair Labs continues to improve our digital platform 
(website, app & 3(rd) party ancillary plug-ins).
   Cost Leadership
   Ryanair has the lowest unit costs of any EU airline, and the cost gap with EU competitors continues to 
widen. FY19 was a year of investment in our people, our support systems and our business as we grow to 
200m guests p.a. by 2024.  Ex-fuel unit costs rose 5% (better than previously guided 6%) due to EUR200m 
higher staff costs (incl. 20% pilot pay increases) and EUR50m higher EU261 costs due to the repeated ATC 
staff shortage disruptions in FY19. As weaker European airlines are sold or fail, airports are competing 
to attract Ryanair's efficient, high load factor, traffic growth.  Our airport costs are 35% lower than 
our nearest competitor. During FY19 our oil bill increased by EUR440m. We are 90% hedged for FY20 at $709 
per tonne and 35% hedged for Q1 FY21 at $654.
   Group Airlines
   In S.2018 we launched Ryanair Sun (now rebranded "Buzz"), our Polish AOC, with 5 B737 aircraft offering 
charter flights to/from Poland.  Buzz has taken over Ryanair's scheduled bases in Poland and will operate 
a fleet of 25 aircraft in FY20 (incl. 7 for charters).  The Buzz management team successfully delivered a 
modest profit in their first year of operations.
   In December 2018, Lauda (an Austrian AOC) became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Ryanair Group. We 
consolidated 3m customers in its first year of operations to March 2019 but suffered exceptional start-up 
losses of EUR139.5m, mainly due to the very late release of its S.2018 schedules, very low promotional 
fares, expensive short-term aircraft leases and an unhedged fuel position. Lauda enters its second year 
with a larger (lower-cost) fleet of 23 A320 aircraft, and a target of just over 6m guests p.a. They have 
signed agreements to grow this fleet to 35 x A320 aircraft for S.2020 and by year 3 (FY21) we believe 
Lauda will grow to carry over 8m guests p.a. and will be trading profitably.
   Higher oil prices and lower fares have seen a wave of EU airline failures including Primera (UK & 
Spain), Small Planet, Azur and Germania (Germany), Sky Works (Switz.), VLM (Belgium), Cobalt (Cyprus), 
Cello & Flybmi (UK) and WOW (Iceland).  Flybe (UK) was sold, while both Alitalia and Thomas Cook airline 
are currently for sale.
   Ryanair closed unprofitable bases in Bremen & Eindhoven and we cut aircraft numbers in Niederrhein, 
Hahn and the Canary Islands. Norwegian has closed multiple bases (many where they compete with Ryanair), 
including Rome, Las Palmas, Palma, Tenerife, Edinburgh & Belfast, and they will cut their Dublin base from 
6 to 1 aircraft in October. Wizz (Poznan), Lufthansa (Dusseldorf) and EasyJet (Oporto) have also announced 
base cuts and/or closures in recent months. We expect further consolidation and airline failures in winter 
2019 and again into 2020 due to over-capacity, weaker fares, and higher oil prices particularly among 
those airlines who are significantly unhedged, or unable to hedge.
   Boeing 737 MAX
   We have delayed the delivery of our first 5 B737-MAX aircraft to Winter 2019 (subject to regulatory 
approval by EASA). We continue to have utmost confidence in these aircraft which have 4% more seats, are 
16% more fuel efficient and generate 40% lower noise emissions. They are hedged at an average EUR/$ rate 
of 1.24 out to FY24, and will deliver significant unit cost savings for the next 5 years, although the 
delayed deliveries in 2019 means that we will not see any meaningful cost benefit until FY21.
   Balance Sheet & Fleet
   The Group's BBB+ rated balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry.  Almost 95% of our 455 
aircraft fleet is owned, with over 63% debt free. At year end the Group had EUR3.2bn gross cash. Ryanair 
generated almost EUR2bn net cash from operations in FY19, but spent over EUR1.5bn on capex (primarily 
aircraft, simulators, engines & hangars), returned EUR560m to shareholders in share buybacks, and repaid 
more than EUR400m of debt. As a result, year-end net debt rose slightly to EUR450m.  We recently concluded 
a low-cost, EUR750m unsecured (5-year) bank facility.  This facility, coupled with strong operating 
cashflows, will fund this year's peak capex of c.EUR2bn, maturing secured debt and other general corporate 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
purposes.  We are also in advanced negotiations to sell 10 of our oldest B737s for over $170m before the 
end of March 2020.
   Shareholder Distributions
   The Board has approved a EUR700m share buyback which will commence later this week and run over the 
next 9 to 12 months.  We expect to split this approx. EUR500m/EUR200m between ADR's and ordinary shares, 
although the Board has discretion to revise this allocation.  This latest buyback will bring to almost 
EUR7bn of the funds returned to shareholders since 2008.
   FY20 Guidance
   While we separately disclosed Lauda's year 1 start-up loss as exceptional in FY19, their FY20 results 
will not be split out in the Ryanair Group income statement.  FY20 guidance is therefore for the 
consolidated Ryanair Group.
   Our outlook for FY20 remains cautious on pricing. Traffic will grow by 8% to 153m. Assuming revenue per 
pax ("RPP") growth of 3%, we are guiding broadly flat Group profits. This will range from EUR750m if RPP 
rises 2%, up to EUR950m if RPP rises 4%.  While H1 bookings are slightly ahead of last year, fares are 
lower and we expect this trend will continue through S.2019. We have zero H2 visibility.  Costs will 
increase as our full-year fuel bill jumps by another EUR460m.  Ex-fuel unit costs will rise by just 2%, 
mainly due to stronger sterling, the absence of Lauda prior-year cost comparisons for most of H1 and 
delivery delays of the B737 MAX aircraft this year. This guidance is heavily dependent on close-in peak 
summer fares, H2 prices, the absence of security events, and no negative Brexit developments."

   Introduction
   For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") (with the exception of the balance 
sheet commentary below) all figures and comments are by reference to the adjusted results excluding the 
exceptional item referred to below.  A reconciliation of the results for the year under IFRS to the 
adjusted results is provided in note 8 of this preliminary financial report.
   The exceptional item in the year ended March 31, 2019 comprised Lauda's exceptional start-up losses of 
EUR139.5M. Lauda became a subsidiary at the start of August 2018 (See note 11).
   MD&A Year Ended March 31, 2019
   Income Statement
   Scheduled revenues:
   Scheduled revenues increased by 1% to EUR5,166.5M due to 7% traffic growth (to 139.1M) offset by a 6% 
reduction in average fares to EUR37.
   Ancillary revenues:
   Ancillary revenues rose by 19% to EUR2,396.4M due to 7% traffic growth, improved uptake of ancillary 
products, particularly reserved seating and priority boarding services offset by the timing of revenue 
recognition on certain fees (approx. EUR38M) following the transition to IFRS 15.
   Total revenues:
   As a result of the above, total revenues increased by 6% to EUR7,562.9M.
   Operating Expenses:
   Fuel and oil:
   Fuel and oil rose by 23% to EUR2,343.7M due to higher fuel prices, an 8% increase in flight hours and 
the higher cost of carbon credits.
   Airport and handling charges:
   Airport and handling charges increased by 9% to EUR1,026.3M broadly in line with traffic growth.
   Staff costs:
   Staff costs increased 28% to EUR945.0M due to pilot pay increases, 8% more flight hours, recruitment of 
additional engineers to support growth, investment in pilot & cabin crew training and a 3% pay increase 
for non-flight-staff awarded in April 2018.
   Route charges:
   Route charges rose by 3% to EUR722.7M due to the 7% increase in sectors offset by a decrease in unit 
rates.
   Depreciation:
   Depreciation is 13% higher at EUR635.4M, due to the 29 additional B737 owned aircraft in the fleet at 
period end, the purchase of 9 spare engines, 2 simulators and 2 new hangars.
   Marketing, distribution and other:
   Marketing, distribution and other rose by 12% to EUR458.5M primarily due to higher EU261 costs arising 
mainly from ATC disruptions and related cancellations during the year.
   Maintenance, materials and repairs:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -4-
   Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by 19% to EUR177.2M due to higher scheduled engine 
maintenance arising from the higher number of shop visits for older aircraft and the timing of lease 
handbacks.
   Aircraft rentals:
   Aircraft rentals fell by 20% to EUR65.5M due to 5 fewer leased B737 aircraft in the fleet compared to 
the same period last year. (FY 19: 26 / FY 18: 31).
   Unit costs rose by 9% (excluding fuel they increased by 5%).
   Net finance expense:
   Net finance expense decreased by 5% to EUR55.4M due to lower gross debt and higher interest rates on 
deposits.
   Balance sheet:
   Gross cash decreased by EUR485.2M to EUR3,194.9M at March 31, 2019.
   Gross debt fell by EUR318.6M to EUR3,644.4M due to debt repayments.
   EUR2,064.4M net cash was generated by operating activities. Capital expenditure was EUR1,541.6M and 
shareholder returns amounted to EUR560.5M.
   Net debt was EUR449.5M at year end.  (March 2018: EUR282.9M).
   Shareholders' equity:
   Shareholders' equity increased by EUR746.0M to EUR5,214.9M in the period due to IFRS hedge accounting 
treatment for derivatives of EUR634.3M and consolidated group net profit after tax of EUR885.0M, offset by 
EUR560.5M of shareholder returns and the IFRS 15 transition adjustment to opening reserves.
   Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
   Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
   Preliminary Financial Statements
    1.            Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
   Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The unaudited condensed 
consolidated preliminary financial statements of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2019 comprise 
the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
   These unaudited condensed consolidated preliminary financial statements ("the preliminary financial 
statements"), which should be read in conjunction with our 2018 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 
2018, have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial 
Reporting" as adopted by the EU ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full 
annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2018, are available at http://investor.ryanair.com/.
   The March 31, 2019 figures and the March 31, 2018 comparative figures do not constitute statutory 
financial statements of the Group within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2014. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 31, 2018, together with the independent 
auditor's report thereon, were filed with the Irish Registrar of Companies following the Company's Annual 
General Meeting and are also available on the Company's Website. The auditor's report on those financial 
statements was unqualified.
   The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the condensed 
consolidated preliminary financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2019 on May 17, 2019.
   Except as stated otherwise below, this year's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
   Accounting for Investment in associates
   An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence.  Significant influence is 
the power to participate in the financial and operating decisions of the entity, but is not control over 
these policies. The Company's investment in associates was accounted for using the equity method.  The 
consolidated income statement reflects the Company's share of profit/losses after tax of the associate.  
Investments in associates are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at cost adjusted for post-
acquisition changes in the Company's share of net assets, less any impairment in value.  If necessary, any 
impairment losses on the carrying amount of the investment in the associate are reported within the 
Company's share of equity accounted investments results in the consolidated income statement.  If the 
Company's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the associate, the carrying amount is reduced to 
nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has incurred 
obligations in respect of the associate.
   Accounting for business combinations
   Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method from the date that control is 
transferred to the Group. Under the acquisition method, consideration transferred is measured at fair 
value on the acquisition date, as are the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -4-
   When the initial values of assets and liabilities in a business combination have been determined 
provisionally, any subsequent adjustments to the values allocated to the identifiable assets and 
liabilities (including contingent liabilities) are made within twelve months of the acquisition date and 
presented as adjustments to the original acquisition accounting.  Acquisition related costs are expensed 
in the period incurred.
   Accounting for subsidiaries
   Subsidiaries are all entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed 
to (has rights to) variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power over the entity.

   --          Long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at March 31, 2019 to arrive at 
a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
   There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the year ended March 
31, 2019 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.
   The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial balance sheet, are as follows:

    13.          Shareholder returns
   In the year ended March 31, 2019 the Company bought back 37.8M ordinary shares at a total cost of 
EUR561M.  This buy-back was equivalent to approximately 3.2% of the Company's issued share capital at 
March 31, 2018.  All of these ordinary shares repurchased were cancelled at March 31, 2019.
   In FY18 the Company bought back 46.7M shares at a total cost of EUR829M.  This buy-back was equivalent 
to approximately 3.8% of the Company's issued share capital at March 31, 2017.  All of these repurchased 
ordinary shares were cancelled at March 31, 2018.
   As a result of the share buybacks in the year ended March 31, 2019, share capital decreased by 37.8M 
ordinary shares (46.7M ordinary shares in the year ended March 31, 2018) with a nominal value of EUR0.2M 
(EUR0.3M in the year ended March 31, 2018) and the other undenominated capital reserve increased by a 
corresponding EUR0.2M (EUR0.3M in the year ended March 31, 2018). The other undenominated capital reserve 
is required to be created under Irish law to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
    14.          Related party transactions
   The Company's related parties comprise its subsidiaries, Directors and senior key management personnel. 
All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.

financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no changes in the 
related party transactions described in the 2018 Annual Report that could have a material effect on the 
financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.
    15.          Post balance sheet events
   The Group recently concluded a low cost, EUR750M unsecured (5 year) bank facility, for general

   *These standards or amendments to standards are not as yet EU endorsed
   IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 have been adopted in the financial year ended March 31, 2019. Changes to significant 
accounting policies, together with the impact of adoption, are described below:
   IFRS 15:  Revenue from Contracts with Customers
   The Group has adopted IFRS 15 with effect from April 1, 2018. The standard establishes a five-step 
model to determine when to recognise revenue and at what amount.  Revenue is recognised when the good or 
service has been transferred to the customer and at the amount to which the entity expects to be entitled.
   The impact of initially applying the standard is mainly attributed to certain ancillary revenue streams 
where the recognition of revenue is deferred under IFRS 15 to the flight date where it was previously 
recognised on the date of booking.  For the majority of our revenue, the manner in which we previously 
recognised revenue is consistent with the requirements of IFRS 15.  The change in the timing of ancillary 
revenue recognition means that an increased amount of revenue will be recognised in the first half of the 
year under IFRS 15, with less revenue recognised in the second half of the year, particularly in Quarter 
4.
   The Group has adopted IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method (without practical expedients), with 
the effect of initially applying this standard recognised at the date of initial application (i.e. April 
1, 2018). Accordingly, the comparatives have not been restated - i.e. they are presented, as previously 
reported, under IAS 18 and related interpretations.  The impact on transition to IFRS 15, was a reduction 
in retained earnings (net of tax) of EUR249M at April 1, 2018.
   The impact of adopting IFRS 15 on the Group's preliminary balance sheet as at March 31, 2019 was an 
increase in the amount of deferred revenue of EUR287M, compared with the amount that would have been 
recognised under IAS 18 and related interpretations. The impact on the preliminary income statement and 
the preliminary statement of comprehensive income is to decrease ancillary revenue in the year ended March 
31, 2019 by EUR38M.
   There is a nil net impact on the Group's preliminary statement of cash flows for the year ended March 
31, 2019.
   IFRS 9:  Financial Instruments
   The Group has adopted IFRS 9 with effect from April 1, 2018 and has not restated comparative 
information.  The standard introduces a new model for the classification and measurement of financial 
assets, a new impairment model based on expected credit losses and a new hedge accounting model to more 
closely align hedge accounting with risk management strategy and objectives. This standard replaces IAS 39 
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
   Financial assets, excluding derivatives, are accounted for at amortised cost, fair value through other 
comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss depending on the nature of the contractual cash 
flows of the asset and the business model in which it is held. Accordingly, no transition adjustment to 
carrying values arose in the year ended March 31, 2019. Neither was there a material increase in 
provisions as a result of applying the new expected loss impairment model to our financial assets as a 
result of adoption of IFRS 9 in the year ended March 31, 2019.  All of Ryanair's financial assets continue 
to be held at amortised cost.  The Group has not elected to adopt the new general hedge accounting model 
in IFRS 9.
   IFRS 16:  Leases
   IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet, lease accounting model for lessees.  A lessee recognises 
a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing 
its obligation to make lease payments. There are optional exemptions for short-term leases and leases of 
low value items.
   The standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Early adoption is 
permitted for entities that apply IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers at or before the date of 
initial application of IFRS 16.  Ryanair does not intend to early adopt IFRS 16.
   The impact of the IFRS 16 transition will increase non-current assets on April 1, 2019 by c. EUR130M, 
increase liabilities by c. EUR140M and reduce equity (and distributable reserves) by approximately EUR10M.

    2.            Judgements and estimates
   The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
   In preparing these condensed consolidated preliminary financial statements, the significant judgements 
made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation 
uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial 
statements.
    3.            Seasonality of operations
   The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly, 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
    4.            Income tax expense
   The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the year ended March 31, 2019 
was 6.7% (March 31, 2018: 10.0%).  The tax charge for the year ended March 31, 2019 of EUR63.1M (March 31, 
2018: EUR161.1M) comprises a current tax charge of EUR96.5M, a deferred tax charge of EUR9.8M relating to 
the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment, a transitional adjustment on adoption of 
IFRS15 (effective April 2018), and a deferred tax credit of EUR43.2M relating to Lauda losses.
    5.            Share based payments
   The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements. The Company granted options over 20 million shares in the period, under 
the terms of the 2013 Share Option Scheme approved by the shareholders at the AGM in September 2013

   The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
    7.            Capital commitments
   At March 31, 2019 the Group had an operating fleet of 455 (2018: 431) Boeing 737 aircraft and 16 Airbus 
A320 aircraft.  The Group agreed to purchase 183 new Boeing 737-800NG aircraft from the Boeing Corporation 
during the periods FY15 to FY19, all of which (including 29 in the year) were delivered at March 31, 2019.
   The Group also agreed to purchase up to 210 (135 firm and 75 options) Boeing 737-MAX-200 aircraft from 
the Boeing Corporation during the periods FY20 to FY24.
    8.            Analysis of operating segment

    10.          Property, plant and equipment
   Acquisitions and disposals
   Capital expenditure in the year ended March 31, 2019 amounted to EUR1,541.6M and primarily relates to 
aircraft pre delivery payments, 29 aircraft deliveries, spare engines, maintenance hangar construction 
costs and simulators.
    11.          Business combinations
   Acquisition of a Subsidiary
   In April 2018, the Company purchased a 24.9% stake in Lauda. This investment was accounted for using 
the equity method. In August 2018, the Company acquired a further 50.1% of the shares and voting interests 
in Lauda. The Company has since increased it's holding in Lauda to 100%. Lauda gives the Group access to 
valuable slots at slot constrained airports in Germany, Austria and Spain.
   In the year ended March 31, 2019, Lauda contributed revenue of EUR134.5M and an operating loss of 
EUR172.9M to the Group's results. Ryanair also recognised EUR9.8M in share of losses in associate prior to 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -6-
consolidation of Lauda, and recognised a deferred tax credit of EUR43.2M relating to the recognition of a 
deferred tax asset in respect of Lauda post-acquisition losses.
   Consideration transferred and assets and liabilities assumed
   The following table summarises the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of 
acquisition of control and the consideration transferred to acquire control of Lauda:
                                                 EURM
  Consideration:
   - Consideration (liabilities & cash paid)      32.0
   - Fair value of existing equity interest        6.0
   - Elimination of intercompany loans            60.5
                                               -------
  Total                                           98.5
                                               -------
 Net assets acquired:
   - Intangible assets                            99.6
   - Cash and cash equivalents                     7.0
   - Other assets acquired                        43.4
   - (Liabilities) acquired                     (51.5)
                                               -------
  Total                                           98.5
                                               -------
  Goodwill
   As the value of identifiable net assets acquired substantially equalled the value of the consideration 
paid plus the fair value of the existing interest in Lauda, there was a nil value attributed to Goodwill.  
The re-measurement to fair value of the Group's initial 24.9% interest in Lauda, from its pre acquisition 
carrying value of nil, resulted in a gain of EUR6M.  This amount has been included in share of associate 
losses in the condensed preliminary income statement.
    12.          Financial instruments and financial risk management
   The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
   These preliminary financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the 2018 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year.
   Fair value hierarchy
   Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
   --          Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
that the Group can access at the measurement date.
   --          Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
that asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
    --          Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
   Fair value estimation
   Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
   Financial instruments measured at fair value
   --          Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to 
determine the fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
   --          Derivatives - currency forwards and aircraft fuel contracts: A comparison of the contracted 
rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at March 31, 2019 has been used to 
establish fair value. (Level 2)
   The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the year ended March 31, 2019, there 
were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
   Financial instruments not measured at fair value

 ================================  ==============  ===========  ============  ============
  The total number of passengers carried increased by 13.3% to 41.6 million (H1 2018: 36.8 million), driven by a 
growth in seats flown of 14.5% to 46.2 million seats (H1 2018: 40.4 million seats) as we continue to strengthen our 
position in key markets as well as completing the annualisation of flying at Berlin Tegel airport. Load factor has 
decreased by 1.0 percentage point to 90.1% (H1 2018: 91.1%).
   Total revenue increased by 7.3% to GBP2,343 million (H1 2018: GBP2,183 million), and increased by 6.1% at 
constant currency. However total revenue per seat fell by 6.3% to GBP50.71 (H1 2018: GBP54.10), and decreased 
by 7.4% at constant currency. The decrease in revenue per seat is a consequence of a number of contributors, 
including the introduction of IFRS 15; the non-repeat of one-off benefits in H1 2018 such as Monarch's bankruptcy 
and Ryanair cancellations; the shift of Easter into the second half of FY 2019; and a dilutive impact from a full 
period of Tegel flying.
   Headline cost per seat excluding fuel increased by 1.2% to GBP43.64 (H1 2018: GBP43.11), and increased by 
1.3% at constant currency. Higher crew costs were recognised from inflationary increases to crew and pilot wages, 
as well as low attrition rates and investment in operational resilience. Airport charges were also adversely impacted 
by the change in airport mix, which is driven by the annualisation of Tegel flying and continued pricing pressure at 
regulated airports. Partially offsetting these were lower disruption and de-icing costs, due to the sustained adverse 
weather in H1 2018, navigation price benefits and a decrease in wet leasing due to the high level of Tegel wet lease 
flying in H1 2018 whilst our own fleet was being introduced.
   Fuel cost per seat increased by 14.0% to GBP13.02 (H1 2018: GBP11.42) and by 7.1% at constant currency, 
driven by hedging fuel at higher rates compared to the prior year, along with increases in the market price.
   A non-headline profit of GBP3 million (H1 2018: GBP50 million charge) was recognised in the period, consisting 
of a GBP2 million gain as a result of the sale and leaseback of 10 A319 aircraft in the period, a GBP2 million credit 
from releasing the balance of the non-headline FY 2018 Commercial IT platform close down accrual no longer

required, a GBP3 million gain for balance sheet revaluations, offset by a GBP4 million charge in relation to Brexit-
related plans.
   Corporate tax has been recognised at an effective rate of 19.7% (H1 2018: 19.8%) based on the anticipated tax 
rate for the full year ending 30 September 2019, resulting in a tax credit of GBP54 million during the period.

 ==============================================  ===========  ===========  ===========
  Basic headline loss per share increased by 52.8 pence and basic total loss per share increased by 41.6 pence as 
a consequence of the GBP208 million increase in the headline loss after tax and a GBP164 million increase in the 
total loss after tax in the six months to 31 March 2019 respectively.
   In line with the stated dividend policy of a payout ratio of 50% of headline profit after tax, easyJet paid an ordinary 
dividend of 58.6 pence per share on 22 March 2019.

 ==================================  ========  ========  =========  =========
  There was a net nil impact on total loss from the year-on-year movements in exchange rates. A GBP9 million 
adverse impact on headline loss was offset by a GBP9 million favourable impact on non-headline profit. The 
adverse impact of the Sterling/US dollar exchange rate on fuel costs has been materially offset by a favourable 
impact on revenue mainly driven by the stronger Euro against Sterling.
   Foreign exchange rate movements arise as easyJet's foreign currency risk management policy is to hedge 
between 65% and 85% of the next 12 months' forecast surplus cash flows on a rolling basis, and hence a portion of 
cash flows remains unhedged. Additionally the Group's foreign currency risk management policy is aimed at 
reducing the impact of a fluctuation in exchange rates on future cash flows, however the timing of cash flows can be 
different to the timing of recognition within the income statement resulting in foreign exchange movements.
   Amounts presented at constant currency are an alternative performance measure and not determined in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS').

 ==========================  ==========  =========  ============  ============
  The total number of passengers carried increased by 13.3% to 41.6 million (H1 2018: 36.8 million), driven by a 
growth in seats flown of 14.5% to 46.2 million seats (H1 2018: 40.4 million seats) as we continue to strengthen our 
position in key markets as well as completing the annualisation of flying at Berlin Tegel airport. Load factor has 
decreased by 1.0 percentage point to 90.1% (H1 2018: 91.1%).
   Total revenue increased by 7.3% to GBP2,343 million (H1 2018: GBP2,183 million). Excluding the impact of IFRS 
15, which changes the recognition of certain fees from the time of booking to the time of flying and reclassifies an 
element of disruption costs up the income statement to offset against revenue, total revenue would have increased 
by 9.9% to GBP2,400 million.
   Total revenue per seat decreased by 6.3% to GBP50.71 (H1 2018: GBP54.10), and by 7.4% at constant 
currency. Strength in underlying trading, with easyJet's brand recognition supporting demand, as well as continued 
growth in ancillary revenue per seat, was more than offset by a number of other contributors. These included the 
one-off benefits in H1 2018 such as Monarch's bankruptcy and Ryanair cancellations; the shift of Easter into the 
second half of FY 2019; the impact of the implementation of IFRS 15 and the dilutive impact of a full period of Tegel 
flying. Excluding the impact of the adoption of IFRS 15, revenue per seat decreased by 4.0% to GBP51.93, and by 
5.1% at constant currency.

  Operating costs and income
   Headline cost per seat excluding fuel increased by 1.2% to GBP43.64, and increased by 1.3% at constant 
currency. Excluding the impact of the adoption of IFRS 15 and 16, headline cost per seat excluding fuel increased 
by 1.6% to GBP43.81. The impact of adopting IFRS 9 on headline costs is minimal.
   Headline airports and ground handling cost per seat increased by 0.6% to GBP16.78, and by 0.8% at constant 
currency. Airport charges were adversely impacted by the change in airport mix, which is driven by the 
annualisation of Tegel flying and the continued inflationary pressure from regulated airports. This was partially offset 
by a continued focus on airport procurement activity as well as a reduction in ground handling charges from a 
significant decrease in de-icing costs due to a non-repeat of the sustained adverse weather in H1 2018.
   Headline crew cost per seat increased by 4.9% to GBP8.77, and by 5.2% at constant currency. This was driven 
by agreed inflationary increases in crew and pilot pay, low attrition rates and investment in operational resilience in 
advance of the busy summer period.
   Headline navigation cost per seat decreased by 7.7% to GBP3.79 and decreased by 7.2% at constant currency 
resulting from decreased rates.
   Headline maintenance cost per seat decreased by 4.3% to GBP3.30, and decreased by 6.0% at constant 
currency. Underlying increases in maintenance costs from inflationary prices rises and unanticipated heavy 
maintenance findings were offset by the impact of the introduction of IFRS 16. The adoption of IFRS 16 reclassifies 
maintenance provision charges out of the maintenance line into the depreciation expense.
   Headline other cost per seat decreased by 6.9% to GBP4.19, and by 8.0% at constant currency. There has been 
a reduction in disruption costs with the more benign weather in H1 2019 leading to a lower number of events plus a 
small reclassification of disruption costs to revenue from the adoption of IFRS 15. These more than offset the 
additional disruption costs arising from the Gatwick drone incident. There has also been a decrease in wet leasing 
costs, due to the high level of Tegel wet lease flying in H1 2018 whilst our own fleet was being introduced.
   Headline other income is an additional line on the face of the consolidated income statement to recognise income 
not originating from customers. This includes items such as insurance receipts, compensation and dividends 
received, which have been reclassified in both FY 2019 and FY 2018.
   Ownership costs
   Ownership cost per seat has been significantly impacted by the adoption of IFRS 16. Under IFRS 16, all aircraft 
and properties previously held under operating leases have been capitalised. Annual operating lease and 
maintenance costs, which would have been recognised under the previous lease accounting standard, are replaced 
by similar aggregated levels of depreciation and interest expense.
easyJet PLC Half-year Report -7-
   Dry lease costs have decreased from GBP67 million in H1 2018 to GBP3 million in H1 2019, with only those 
leases which are exempt under IFRS 16, due to their short duration or low value, now being recognised within this 
line.
   Depreciation costs have increased from GBP95 million in H1 2018 to GBP228 million in H1 2019. Excluding the 
impact of IFRS 16, depreciation increased to GBP116 million, driven by additional depreciation charged as a result 
of the acquisition of 28 new aircraft during FY 2018 and 11 new aircraft during this period.
   Net finance charges have increased from GBP10 million in H1 2018 to GBP20 million in H1 2019, primarily driven 
by the impact on interest expense from the adoption of IFRS 16. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, the net charge 
decreased by GBP2 million mainly due to an increase in interest income, driven by higher yields on GBP and USD 
deposits.

  Fuel costs of GBP602 million were GBP141 million higher than H1 2018. Fuel cost per seat of GBP13.02 was 14% 
higher than last year, and increased by 7.1% at constant currency.
   During the period the average market fuel price increased by 5% to $650 per tonne from $620 per tonne last year. 
The operation of easyJet's fuel and US Dollar hedging meant that the effective fuel price movement saw an 
increase of 25% to GBP493 per tonne from GBP393 per tonne in the previous year.
   The impact of the Sterling/US Dollar exchange rate movement on fuel costs was GBP37 million adverse (H1 
2018: GBP26 million). The increase in fuel costs also reflects the increase in the price of Emissions Trading System 
(ETS) permits from EUR13 at 31 March 2018 to EUR22 at 31 March 2019.

   Results for the six months ending 31 March 2019
   easyJet delivers half year results in line with expectations; investing in long term profit and 
returns; full year outlook unchanged
   Summary
    --      During the first six months of Financial Year 2019 easyJet has:
   o  delivered first half results in line with expectations
   o  brought additional focus on its cost, customer and operational initiatives to underpin the outlook 
for the remainder of the year
   o  continued to invest in the strategy set out in the Our Plan framework and is making good progress on 
its strategic initiatives
   --      Passenger numbers for the six months to 31 March 2019 increased by 4.9 million (13.3%) to 41.6 
million
   --      Capacity(1) increased by 14.5% principally due to annualising of new operations in Berlin. 
easyJet grew its existing network capacity by c.7%. Load factor decreased by 1.0 percentage points to 
90.1% mainly as a result of building loads in Berlin in the first quarter
   --      Total revenue increased by 7.3% to GBP2,343 million (H1 2018: GBP2,183 million) due to capacity 
growth and a foreign exchange benefit negatively offset by, the impact of the move of Easter, the new IFRS 
15 accounting standard and the annualisation of prior year benefits such as Monarch's bankruptcy and 
Ryanair cancelling a large proportion of its winter 2017/8 schedule in the UK. Total revenue per seat 
decreased by 6.3% to GBP50.71 (H1 2018: GBP54.10), with a decrease of 7.4% at constant currency(2)
   --      Headline cost per seat increased by 3.9% to GBP56.66 (H1 2018: GBP54.53) as a result of fuel 
price increases, the impact of foreign exchange, underlying cost inflation, investing in resilience as 
well as the impact of drones at Gatwick in December, mitigated by easyJet's cost programme and fleet up-
gauging. Headline cost per seat excluding fuel at constant currency increased by 1.3%
   --      Headline loss before tax was GBP275 million (H1 2018: loss of GBP18 million) reflecting the 
above revenue and cost drivers, easyJet's normal seasonality as well as increased volume of capacity
easyJet PLC Half-year Report
   --      Total loss before tax of GBP272 million for the six months ended 31 March 2019 (H1 2018: loss 
of GBP68 million) reflecting a small benefit of GBP3 million from non-headline items
   --      easyJet's business model and strategy are underpinned by sector leading balance sheet strength, 
with a net debt position at 31 March 2019 of GBP201 million (under new IFRS 16 accounting standards)
   Outlook
   --     easyJet's headline profit before tax expectations for Financial Year 2019 remain unchanged and 
in line with market expectations
   --     easyJet continues to implement its strategy to secure leading positions at primary airports to 
drive profitable growth, returns and cash flow
   --    Forward bookings for the third quarter are three percentage points behind last year at 72% and 
flat year on year at 34% for the fourth quarter. easyJet's capacity growth in the second half is forecast 
at c.7%
   --    Revenue per seat at constant currency in the second half is now expected to be slightly down. 
This is not helped by the ongoing negative impact of Brexit-related market uncertainty as well as a wider 
macroeconomic slowdown in Europe. This is offsetting a continued focus of yield improving initiatives, the 
move of Easter into the second half, the second-half phasing benefit of IFRS 15, improvements in Berlin 
and more disciplined market capacity growth
   --    However, full year headline cost per seat excluding fuel at constant currency (assuming normal 
levels of disruption in H2) is now also expected to be down. This includes an expected benefit in the 
second half from easyJet's investment in operational resilience to manage the impact of disruption
   --    It is estimated that at current exchange rates(3) and with jet fuel remaining within a $600 
metric tonne to $700 metric tonne trading range, easyJet's unit fuel(4) bill for the 12 months to 30 
September 2019 is likely to increase by between GBP25 million and GBP60 million compared to the 12 months 
to 30 September 2018. easyJet's total fuel cost for the year to 30 September 2019 is currently estimated 
to be approximately GBP1.4 billion
   --    In addition, exchange rate movements are likely to have around a GBP10 million positive impact on 
headline profit before tax compared to the 12 months to 30 September 2018
   --    easyJet is now targeting to consolidate its stronger positions delivered over the past few years 
and as a result its capacity growth in Financial Year 2020 will likely be at the lower end of its historic 
growth rates

  Commenting on the results, Johan Lundgren, easyJet Chief Executive said:
   "easyJet has performed in line with expectations in the first half.
    "I am pleased that despite tougher trading conditions, we flew more than 41 million customers, up 13% 
on last year, performed well operationally with 54% fewer cancellations in the period and customer 
satisfaction with our crew is at an all-time high. We have also continued to make good progress on our 
strategic initiatives in holidays, loyalty, business and with data.
    "Cost control remains a major priority for easyJet.  Our focus is on efficiency and on innovation 
through data and we are on track to deliver more than GBP100m in cost savings during 2019.
    "We are well-equipped to succeed in this more difficult market through a number of short term customer 
and trading initiatives for the summer; measures to improve our operational resilience; and by focusing on 
what is most important to customers - value for money, punctuality and great customer service.  All this 
is underpinned by a market leading balance sheet.
    "We have invested in the operation by doubling our standby aircraft and changed our schedules so that 
even though the external operating environment over the summer is not set to improve, we plan to alleviate 
easyJet PLC Half-year Report
the impact on our customers.  We have rolled out Auto Bag Drop to 17 airports, which combined fly over 34 
million of our customers and we are now the number one airline in Berlin and at our newly opened base in 
Nantes in France.  In total we are now the number one airline at 27 airports across the network, up from 
18 two years ago.
    "Our focus on our customers continues to grow their loyalty.  Our loyal customers are choosing us time 
and again and now account for 76% of total bookings, an increase of seven million since last year."

Body
   Capacity growth of 14.5% in the first half represents investment in stronger positions across the 
network, particularly the strategic opportunities in Berlin and Manchester. Passenger numbers have grown 
by 13.3% to 41.6 million and total revenue in the first half has grown to GBP2,343 million. Underlying 
revenue, including ancillary revenue, has been positive.
   easyJet continues to invest in its customers and the implementation of the Operational Resilience 
programme in the first half has gone well and is delivering early benefits in the summer season.
   Cost control remains a major focus for easyJet. Headline cost per seat excluding fuel at constant 
currency has increased by 1.3%, which includes an estimated GBP10 million direct cost from drones at 
Gatwick and reflects continued inflationary pressures. Both fuel and foreign exchange have been 
significant cost headwinds in the first half.
   As a result of the investment in capacity, structural and revenue timing impacts and cost investment 
for the future, the headline first half loss was GBP275 million, which was in line with management 
expectations.
   Revenue
   Total revenue increased by 7.3% to GBP2,343 million (H1 2018: GBP2,183 million). Revenue per seat 
decreased by 6.3% to GBP50.71, and by 7.4% at constant currency to GBP50.12. This was driven by:
   --     Positive underlying demand for easyJet's attractive network of destinations and frequencies 
supported by easyJet's strong brand
   --     Continued growth in ancillary revenue per seat through better bag and allocated seating sales 
combined with product and pricing initiatives
    --     A foreign currency revenue benefit from a stronger Euro against Sterling
   Offset by:
   --     The dilutive impact of a full period of operations at Berlin Tegel in its first full year of 
operations. easyJet grew capacity in Tegel by 50% in the six month period, which will naturally have put 
pressure on market prices
   --     The impact of the move to IFRS 15 accounting standard changing the timing of recognition of 
revenue (GBP57m total revenue impact in H1)
   --     Cancelled flights and lost revenue resulting from the drone issue at London Gatwick (c.GBP5m 
revenue impact)
   --     A decrease of 1.0 percentage points in load factor to 90.1% as anticipated, due to Berlin 
dilution and the one-off increase in prior year late demand
easyJet PLC Half-year Report -2-
   --     Seasonality - the movement of Easter to the second half of the financial year (H1 impact of 
c.GBP45m)
   --     The impact of lower market capacity benefits in the prior year, including the one-off impact 
from the bankruptcies at Monarch and Air Berlin and the winter withdrawal of Ryanair from the UK domestic 
market
   easyJet has started a number of initiatives to drive yield and ancillary revenue, supported in 
particular by increasing availability and deployment of data and by new product development. Investment in 
these has been prioritised and is now expected to support trading in the fourth quarter as well as for the 
future. These initiatives include:
    --     Increasing the use of data in our pricing algorithms for both tickets and ancillary products
   --     Developing the allocated seat band product further from the three bands in use at the beginning 
of the year to five by the end of April
   --     Developing product bundles quicker, in particular targeting business customers with a flexible, 
fast and value-focused combination that includes a seat at the front of the cabin, second cabin bag, 
Speedy Boarding and Fast Track security
   Cost
   easyJet's underlying cost performance has been solid despite external inflationary pressures. Headline 
cost per seat including fuel increased by 3.9% to GBP56.66 (H1 2018: GBP54.53). Headline cost per seat 
including fuel at constant currency increased by 2.5% to GBP55.88.
   Headline cost per seat excluding fuel increased by 1.3% at constant currency to GBP43.65 (H1 2018: 
GBP43.11). This cost increase was driven by:
   --     Inflationary cost pressures including higher regulated airport charges, changes to airport mix 
and prices rises in maintenance costs
    --     Annualisation of previously agreed crew pay deals
    --     Ownership costs reflecting new aircraft year on year and the impact of IFRS 16 accounting
   --     A c.GBP10million cost impact of the drones at Gatwick relating to customer welfare costs. The 
incident affected around 82,000 customers and led to over 400 flights being cancelled
    --     Investment in operational resilience ahead of the busy summer period
   easyJet's cost programme has partly offset these challenges and continued to deliver substantial 
savings in particular:
   --     Lower overall levels of disruption, cancellations and delays over three hours despite the drone 
issue at Gatwick
   --     Fleet up-gauging from A319 ceo to A320 neo and A321 neo albeit this has been marginally lower 
than planned due to Airbus delivery delays
   --     Established strategic relationships with key suppliers, particular airports and ground handling 
agents, to drive long-term cost efficiencies
    --     Lower de-icing costs due to relatively benign weather
    --     Lower navigation charges
   Fuel cost per seat increased by 14.0% to GBP13.02 (H1 2018: GBP11.42) and by 7.1% at constant currency, 
driven by a higher hedged fuel price compared to the prior year, along with increases in the market price, 
partially offset by a continued investment into more fuel efficient aircraft.
   Non-headline costs
   easyJet had a GBP3 million benefit in non-headline items during the first half of Financial Year 2019. 
These items are separately disclosed as non-headline profit before tax items. The most significant items 
were as follows:
   --     GBP2 million non-cash profit as a result of the sale and leaseback of ten A319 aircraft in the 
period (H1 2018: charge of GBP19 million), a small change to previous guidance as the terms of the 
transaction were finalised
   --     GBP3 million gain from the retranslation of balance sheet assets and liabilities (H1 2018: nil)
    --     GBP4 million charge for ongoing organisational and legal costs associated with easyJet's 
Brexit-mitigation programme (H1 2018: charge of GBP4 million)
   There were no non-headline charges relating to Tegel, which is now fully integrated into the underlying 
business (H1 2018: charge of GBP24 million).
   Non-headline items are material non-recurring items or are items which do not reflect the trading 
performance of the business. Further detail can be found in the notes to the accounts.
   Strategic progress
   Delivering Our Plan
   easyJet has a well-established business model that provides a strong foundation to drive profitable 
growth and long term shareholder returns. easyJet is delivering its strategy through its new strategic 
framework which is called 'Our Plan'. The five priorities are:
    1.    Network - number one or number two in primary airports
    2.    Winning our customers' loyalty
easyJet PLC Half-year Report -2-
    3.    Value by efficiency
    4.    The right people
    5.    Innovating with data
    1.    Network - number one or number two in primary airports
   easyJet's strategy is focused on key airports, serving valuable catchment areas that represent Europe's 
top markets by GDP, driving both leisure and business travel.
   easyJet has now reached a number one position in 27 airports, an increase of two airports since H1 2018 
and easyJet is now number one or number two at 25 of its 29 bases. 54% of easyJet capacity is flown from 
an airport where easyJet has a number one position and easyJet's seat capacity at airports where it has 
number one or number two positions has increased by almost seven million seats since 2018 to 78 million 
seats.
   During the first half of Financial Year 2019, easyJet targeted two strategic investment opportunities, 
at Berlin Tegel and Manchester airports, as well as continuing to build its share in existing markets 
adding frequencies and destinations. In addition, around 2% of capacity growth in the first half was 
through up-gauging to bigger aircraft, by which easyJet can continue to deliver growth in slot constrained 
airports and drive higher returns.
   easyJet is continuing to consolidate its position in Berlin and is now the number one airline in that 
market. With increased overall scale, operations at the business-friendly Tegel, a growing domestic 
network and additional international destinations, easyJet is establishing a strong presence in Berlin. 
The Germania airline bankruptcy has led to a benefit in terms of capacity and easyJet has secured 
additional aircraft parking at Tegel, which has allowed a reduction in costly outstation overnight stops 
and the opportunity to drive revenue with a better schedule and offer for the local Berlin customer.
   easyJet continues to target growth in regional France, leveraging its long-established brand and 
network presence. In April easyJet opened a new base in Nantes, which brings its number one positions in 
France to six, including Nice, Lyon, Bordeaux, Nantes, Lille and Grenoble as well as a number two position 
in Paris Charles de Gaulle and Toulouse.
   easyJet also consolidated its position as the UK's leading airline in the domestic market, with growth 
at Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast, Liverpool, Southend and Bristol, as well as continuing to 
strengthen its number one positions in Italy at Milan Malpensa, Venice and Naples.
    2.    Winning our customers' loyalty
   easyJet continues to implement its customer focused strategy in order to drive revenue, leading to 
increasing loyalty, brand recognition and offering its customer a range of attractive products. This is 
achieved through an attractive flying network, market-leading digital tools and a high level of customer 
service.

 easyJet trading update and pre-close statement
 for the six months to 31 March 2019
 1 April 2019
 This announcement contains inside information
 easyJet expects to deliver a first half performance in line with the guidance given in the Q1 2019 trading statement 
on 22(nd) January 2019, with an expected first half headline loss before tax of around GBP275 million.
 Revenue
 Total first half revenue is expected to grow by circa 7.3% to circa GBP2,340 million with seat capacity increasing by 
circa 14.5% to circa 46.2 million as easyJet continues to strengthen its position in key markets as well as 
completing the annualisation of its flying at Berlin Tegel airport.
 Revenue per seat at constant currency is expected to have declined by circa 7.4%, in line with previous guidance 
of a mid to high single digit decline for the half. Underlying revenue is expected to be positive, offset by the impact 
of IFRS 15, the move of Easter into the second half as well as the dilutive impact of flying at Berlin Tegel and the 
prior year impacts from the Monarch administration and Ryanair cancellations.
 Cost
 Total headline cost in the first half is expected to increase by circa 18.8% due to increased capacity, higher fuel 
unit costs and a modest increase in cost per seat excluding fuel.
 Headline cost per seat excluding fuel at constant currency is expected to increase by circa 1.4% for the half, in line 
with expectations. This reflects investment in resilience in advance of the busy summer period and in particular 
higher ownership and crew costs.
 Fuel and FX
easyJet PLC easyJet trading update and H1 pre-close statement
 It is expected that easyJet's unit fuel bill for the six months to 31 March 2019 will be around GBP37 million 
adverse, while headline foreign exchange will have an adverse impact of around GBP8 million.
 Brexit
 easyJet has continued to make good progress in its European ownership requirements (excluding UK 
shareholders) and has now reached 49.92%.
 The EU Parliament has passed its air connectivity legislation, which together with the UK's confirmation that it will 
reciprocate plus our well planned and executed operational initiatives mean that whatever happens, easyJet will be 
flying as usual.
 Outlook
 Whilst easyJet will deliver H1 results in line with expectations, macroeconomic uncertainty and many unanswered 
questions surrounding Brexit are together driving weaker customer demand in the market, such that we are seeing 
increasing softness in ticket yields in the UK and across Europe. Given this uncertainty our outlook for H2 is now 
more cautious.
 Despite this, H2 revenue per seat at constant currency is expected to be slightly up, which reflects weakening Q3 
underlying demand and an expected year on year uptick in Q4 driven by a programme of yield initiatives and an 
assumption of a more certain Brexit outlook.
 There is no change to guidance for Full Year headline cost per seat excluding fuel at constant currency, which is 
still expected to be circa flat (assuming no abnormal levels of disruption).
 Fuel and Foreign exchange guidance will be updated at our half year results announcement.
 easyJet will provide further details on its performance in the six months to 31 March 2019 and forward looking 
guidance at its half year results on 17 May 2019.
 Commenting; Johan Lundgren, easyJet Chief Executive said:
 "easyJet has performed in line with expectations in the first half. We have flown around 42 million customers with a 
significantly reduced number of cancellations and continued high levels of customer satisfaction.
 "We are operationally well prepared for Brexit.  Now that the EU Parliament has passed its air connectivity 
legislation and together with the UK's confirmation that it will reciprocate, means that whatever happens, we'll be 
flying as usual.  I am pleased that we have also made progress on our European ownership position which is now 
above 49%.
 "For the second half we are seeing softness in both the UK and Europe, which we believe comes from 
macroeconomic uncertainty and many unanswered questions surrounding Brexit which are together driving weaker 
customer demand. We are rolling out further initiatives to support our trading and are making significant progress in 
our Operational Resilience Programme, which is designed to make the easyJet flying experience better for our 
customers over the summer.
 "As a highly profitable airline with one of the strongest balance sheets in aviation easyJet is well positioned to 
seamlessly connect Europe with the warmest welcome in the sky."

announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.

 STOBART GROUP LIMITED
 ("Stobart Group" or the "Company")
 Pre-Close Trading Statement and Update on Capital Review
 Stobart Group, the Aviation, Energy and Civil Engineering group, issues the following pre-close trading 
statement and capital review update prior to the announcement of the full year results for the 12 months 
to 28 February 2019, which will be published on 15 May 2019.
 The Company continues to make strong commercial progress in its core Aviation and Energy operating 
divisions and is trading in line with management expectations.
 Aviation
 London Southend Airport saw a 33% increase in passenger numbers to 1.5m in FY 2019 (FY18 1.12m). 
Preparations are well underway to welcome Ryanair, who will base three aircraft at the airport from April 
2019. London Southend Airport was also pleased to announce recently that Loganair will be launching 
flights to Glasgow and Aberdeen from May 2019, and to Carlisle Lake District Airport in July, supporting 
further passenger growth.
 On 22 February, Stobart Group confirmed it had disposed of its regional airline and aircraft leasing 
businesses in return for becoming a 30% shareholder, alongside Virgin Atlantic and Cyrus Capital, in a 
newly created private vehicle, Connect Airways. Stobart Group recognised a profit on disposal, on an 
accounting basis. The disposed businesses will be treated as discontinued operations in the FY 2019 
results, with the FY2018 results restated. Stobart Group expects to include 30% of any profit after tax of 
Connect Airways in its Group results going forward.
 Energy
 All but three of the power plants in the UK and Ireland that Stobart Energy supply to have completed the 
commissioning phase and are now in full contractual operations, meaning the owners of those are confident 
that the plants are at a level where it can perform consistently. This improvement has helped Stobart 
Energy to deliver 1.3 million tonnes of renewable fuel, representing an increase of over 45% on the 
Stobart Group Limited Pre-Close Trading Statement
previous year. This improvement was achieved despite continued challenges with underperforming Power 
Plants during their commissioning period. As a result of these challenges, Stobart Energy will continue to 
carry non-underlying pre-contract costs until the plants all reach the end of their commissioning periods. 
Therefore, Stobart Energy is seeking to negotiate compensation packages with the various plant owners.
 Rail & Civils
 The Company reported at the time of its interim results that it had seen a material reduction in 
profitability against management's expectations. This reduction followed a review of ongoing contracts 
that were substantially completed in prior periods, resulting in a downgrade in the recorded performance 
of those contracts.
 Following the conclusion of the review, Stobart Rail & Civils strengthened the management team and has 
put in place a more disciplined approach to contract quality, focusing on securing contracts with external 
tier-one customers. This process is generating improved results in terms of new business. This year the 
team has worked on the Newton Heath Maintenance Building Project for Northern Rail and recently signed a 
significant new contract with Nexus; the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive.
 Capital Review and Dividend
 At the time of the publication of Stobart Group's interim results to 31 August 2018 on 24 October 2018, 
the Company announced its intention to undertake a capital review. Further details of the review were 
announced on 3 December 2018.
 Stobart Group continues to review its capital requirements.  The objective is to ensure that the Company 
can accelerate and deliver its ambitious plans to fund future growth and shareholder returns from 
operating cashflow on a sustainable basis.
 The majority of the Group's planned investment will be deployed at London Southend Airport to put in 
place the infrastructure required to serve up to 10 million passengers per year. The Company continues to 
evaluate both the quantum of the investment required and the opportunities to fund growth through the 
disposal of non-core assets. To that end, Stobart Group has recently increased its available cash 
resources to support its growth plans through asset sales and the placement of shares on 11 January 2019 
with Cyrus Capital, generating GBP24.7m, following the announcement of the recommended cash offer for 
Flybe PLC.
 In light of the current assessment of our investment requirements and cash flow the Board believes it 
would be more appropriate to move to a twice-yearly dividend made in equal payments of 3p per share. The 
first payment of 3p per share is expected to be paid in July 2019.
 The person responsible for arranging the release of this announcement on behalf of Stobart Group is 
Louise Brace, Company Secretary.

 RYANAIR BOARD PASSES RESOLUTIONS
 TO PROTECT THE COMPANY'S EU AIRLINE LICENCES POST-BREXIT
 As previously advised (https://investor.ryanair.com/brexit/), Ryanair Holdings PLC (the "Company") must 
take steps to ensure that, in the event of a no-deal or "hard" Brexit,  the Company (and therefore its 
subsidiary EU airlines) will remain majority EU owned and controlled. This is necessary to ensure 
continued compliance with the airline ownership and control requirements of EU Regulation 1008/2008.
 The Board of Ryanair Holdings PLC (the "Board") on Friday afternoon, 8 March 2019, passed a number of 
resolutions which will become effective from the date on which UK nationals cease to qualify as nationals 
of Member States for the purposes of Article 4 of EU Regulation 1008/2008 ("Hard Brexit Day").
 In accordance with the powers delegated to the Board pursuant to the Company's Articles of Association 
(the "Articles"), the Board has resolved that with effect from Hard Brexit Day:
 --     all Ordinary Shares and Depositary Shares held by or on behalf of non-EU (including UK) 
shareholders will be treated as "Restricted Shares" (within the meaning of the Articles);
 --     Restricted Share Notices will be issued to the registered holder(s) of each Restricted Share, 
specifying that the holder(s) of such shares shall not be entitled to attend, speak or vote at any general 
meeting of the Company for so long as those shares are treated as Restricted Shares;
 --     notwithstanding the powers vested in the chairman of general meetings of Ryanair pursuant to 
Article 41(J)(i) of the Articles, the chairman will not vote any Restricted Shares at any meeting of the 
Company.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Brexit contingency resolutions
 These resolutions will remain in place until the Board determines that the ownership and control of the 
Company is no longer such that there is any risk to the airline licences held by the Company's 
subsidiaries pursuant to EU Regulation 1008/2008.
 For the avoidance of doubt, the prohibition on non-EU nationals acquiring Ordinary Shares in Ryanair 
Holdings PLC, as announced by the Company on 5 February 2002, continues to apply.  Consequently, with 
effect from Hard Brexit Day, UK nationals will not be permitted to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company.
