A near 7pc surge in Ryanair's shares helped keep the ISEQ out of negative territory but with gains limited by the 
news that the US expects a USD1.5 trillion budget deficit.
The index rose 5.22 points to 2,981.47.
Ryanair raised its profit forecast and said an industry slump it has exploited to expand rapidly at the expense of less 
nimble rivals is set to continue, sending its shares sharply higher. "Generally we're quite positive on recession," 
Ryanair Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar said. "At this point there is really no sign (of an) end yet." Europe's 
biggest low-cost airline led blue chip gainers after it said it is still gaining market share from the continent's leading 
flag carriers Air France-KLM and British Airways - which have signalled their business is stabilising - and Deutsche 
Lufthansa. It also said fares were declining less than anticipated after it cut loss-making winter capacity and 
replaced it with more promising new routes. Ryanair, which in December broke off talks with Boeing on a potential 
order of up to 200 aircraft, said it was still planning to scale back investments from 2013, when it could start 
returning cash to shareholders. The airline's shares rose by 22c to E3.57.
There was speculation at the weekend suggesting that there could be further delays to the introduction of NAMA. 
According to the reports the target date to begin buying the loans, February 12, could be delayed as they are still 
awaiting approval from the European Commission. With an interim management statements due from Bank of 
Ireland in the coming weeks and the full year releases from AIB and Irish Life and Permanent on the week 
beginning March 1, there will be a constant flow of news on the topic of NAMA over the coming few weeks, said 
Goodbody Stockbrokers. Shares in AIB dropped 5c to E1.24, Bank of Ireland declined by 6c to E1.27 and Irish Life 
and Permanent rose 10c to E3.20. Cranswick, the UK fresh meats producer, said today that it saw organic growth 
of 17pc in the past quarter on 2009. Strong sales growth was recorded in bacon sausages and cooked meats, all of 
which are important product lines for Kerry group in the UK. Its performance was assisted by the acquisition in June

of CCF Norfolk. We expect that Kerry is also seeing some positive momentum in its UK operations (the UK 
accounts for about 33pc of Kerry Foods' business) though we believe Ireland remains difficult. Kerry's shares fell 
73c to E20.70. Looking at prospects for Elan's Tysabri, Davy said 2009 out-turn indicated that the efficacy message 
can spur growth, even with difficult conditions forecast due to several patients contracting the potentially deadly 
brain condition, PML. Risk mitigation will advance in 2010 as more hard data become available on PML incidence 
rates and as prescribing and monitoring standards increase (especially in Europe). Elan's shares fell 18c to E5.30.

Body
Low fares airline Ryanair has this morning increased its profit forecast for the year after posting a narrower-than-
expected third-quarter loss.
The lower loss was the result of fares falling less than earlier projected.
Europe's biggest low-cost airline said market conditions remained difficult and it was still gaining market share from 
the three leading flag carrier groups Deutsche Lufthansa, Air France-KLM British Airways.
Ryanair, which in December broke off talks with Boeing on a potential order of up to 200 aircraft, reiterated that it 
was planning to scale back investments from 2013 and it could start returning cash to shareholders instead. 
Ryanair's net loss of 10.9m euros in the three months to the end of December compared with a 118.8m euro net 
loss a year earlier and a forecast for a net loss of 35.1m euros by Ryanair's in-house broker Davy. "We have now 
increased our full-year net profit guidance to 275m euro from the lower end of the range of 200 million to 300m 
previously guided," chief executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement. Revenue increased by 1pc in the third 
quarter to 612m euros and fares fell less than expected, allowing it to forecast that the fall in full-year yields -- a 
measure of average fare levels -- would be closer to 15pc than the 20pc earlier guided.

ticket prices," Commerzbank analyst Johannes Braun said. "Nothing will change." Ryanair, which last year posted 
its first loss in 20 years after writing down the value of its minority stake in former takeover target Aer Lingus, said in 
January fares would stay flat on average during the current calendar year. To meet its long-term profit growth 
targets, Ryanair would have to raise fares "somewhere down the line", Millar said. Its shares rose 5.7 percent to 
3.54 euros by 1115 GMT, making it the biggest percentage gainer on a FTSEurofirst 300 index that fell 0.2 percent. 
Aer Lingus, which has been struggling to turn profitable, said last week it would try to position itself somewhere 
between Ryanair's no-frills model and full-service carriers to increase revenue. "People who generally standin the 
middle of the road generally get run down by a juggernaut," Ryanair's Millar said, though he reiterated Ryanair was 
unlikely to make a third bid for its smaller Irish competitor. Ryanair's net loss of 10.9 million euros in the third

The results were better than expected as yields only fell by 12% rather than the 20% originally predicted.
"Our Q3 loss of (EURO)11m is disappointing although better than expected, and a significant improvement on last 
year's Q3," says Michael O'Leary, CEO of Ryanair.&"These numbers are distorted by a 37% fall in fuel costs which 
offset a 12% decline in average fares."
Ryanair says that yields for the fourth quarter will fall by only 15% rather than 20%, which was originally expected. 
The airline has also improved its net profit guidance to (EURO)275 million, from the lower end of (EURO)200 million 
to (EURO)300 million.
&
"Ryanair remains uniquely positioned to benefit from the accelerating pace of airline consolidation and closures in 
Europe which has led to significant capacity reductions," says O'Leary in the quarterly report.
&
In recent months airlines such as Blue Wings in Germany, Flyglobespan in Scotland, Sky Europe in Slovakia and 
My Air in Italy have ceased operations. Not only has Ryanair been able to increase its market share as a result, but 
the airline is anticipating further casualties this winter.&
&
"Market conditions remain difficult, although the increasing pace of consolidation and closures among our 
competitors allied to Ryanair's continuing fleet expansion will lead to further market share gains this year in 
particular in Italy, Scandinavia, Spain, and the UK," says O'Leary.
&
Ryanair announces a better Q3 for 2009
The low cost carrier also says that it continues to increase competition with Europe's largest flag carriers, Air 
France, British Airways and Lufthansa.&
No order with Boeing
At the European Airfinance conference in Dublin two weeks ago, Ryanair CFO, Howard Millar affirmed that Ryanair 
had discontinued negotiations with American manufacturer, Boeing, for a 200 aircraft order.
&
The two parties could not reach agreement on the deal that would cover deliveries for 200 737-800s between 2013 
and 2016.
&
In its third quarter financial report, Ryanair says that the delivery terms and conditions were not acceptable to the 
airline and that management will not reopen discussions with the manufacturer.
&
"If there is to be any future agreement on aircraft then it will have to be on materially improved terms," says 
O'Leary.&
&
Ryanair advises that it will continue to grow as it takes delivery of 112 aircraft until the end of 2012. As a result, the 
airline is predicting that its gross capital expenditure will fall annually from (EURO)1.2bn in fiscal year 2010 to 
approximately (EURO)0.1bn by fiscal 2014.&
&
The company says that it will generate up to (EURO)1 billion of surplus cash by the end of 2013 to return to 
shareholders.&&&

BA and Ryanair on diverging routes

If proof is needed of what a difference a recession can make to two companies in the same industry, it should 
become clear when Ryanair   and British Airways   report third-quarter results this week, writes Pilita Clark .
No-frills Ryanair, which reports today , is expected to show it is on course for full-year pre-tax profits of EUR200m-
EUR300m, with analysts polled by Reuters and Bloomberg forecasting about EUR290m.
When BA reports on Friday , however, analysts say the figures will reveal it is heading for a full-year loss of about 
£580m-£600m, substantially higher than the £401m pre-tax deficit it suffered in the year to the end of March 2009.
The recession explains much of the difference: it makes an airline such as Ryanair more attractive to the budget-
conscious and wreaks havoc on the business-class traffic on which a full-service airline such as BA depends for a 
big portion of revenue.
Analysts will be keen to hear BA's views on the impact of its continuing industrial dispute with cabin crew. They will 
also want updates on the merger with Iberia of Spain and the talks on cutting its pension deficit.
Ryanair shareholders will want to hear more on its recently announced plans to slow growth and start paying a 
dividend from a swelling cash pile.

  BP and Royal Dutch Shell , Europe's two largest energy companies, report full-year results today and Thursday 
respectively, and will show the impact of conditions that remain difficult for the industry, writes Ed Crooks .
Although the oil price has risen strongly from its low point below $33 a year ago to about $75 at the end of last 
week, gas prices in the US and UK have remained weak, in spite of a pick-up in the past two months, and refining 
margins have been at their weakest for 15 years.
US companies have given warning of the margin squeeze, with ConocoPhillips, America's third-largest oil group, 
last week reporting a loss in its refining and marketing division.
Shell, with its greater exposure to the refining business, will be worse affected than BP, and analysts recently 
downgraded forecasts for underlying fourth-quarter net profits from about $3.5bn to about $2.9bn. That compares 
with $4.8bn reported for the final quarter of 2008.
The results will not yet reflect the full impact of the cost-cutting plans launched by Peter Voser, the chief executive 
who took over last July.

  Unilever is expected to report underlying revenue growth of close to 4 per cent at its full-year results 
announcement, driven by higher sales volumes, writes Jenny Wiggins .
Chief executive Paul Polman's focus over the past year on pushing up sales volumes has paid off, with third-quarter 
volume growth of 3.6 per cent likely to have continued into the fourth quarter.
Profit margins are expected to be slightly higher at about 14 per cent for the full year as the company benefited from 
higher sales volumes, cost-cutting and lower commodity costs.
Analysts say Kraft's acquisition of Cadbury may attract new investors to Unilever as UK institutions unable to own 
the US food group's stock move their money into other parts of the consumer goods sector.
  Investors will be watching for signs of GlaxoSmithKline's ability to meet its commitments to expanding in 
emerging markets and consumer health when the UK-based pharmaceutical group reports its full 2009 results, 
writes Andrew Jack .
The company may also provide guidance on flu vaccine sales after a decline from anticipated levels, and is 
expected to report a significant one-off accounting gain from the spin-off joint venture with Pfizer for HIV into ViiV 
Healthcare.
Consensus forecasts are of pre-tax full year profits of £8.7bn and earnings per share of £1.19 on sales of £28.2bn.
  When Sony reports third-quarter results the stakes will be higher than at any time since the group first warned of 
deep losses last year, writes Robin Harding .
Sony's share price has risen above Y3,000 in recent weeks for the first time since October 2008 as investors 
speculate that it had a strong Christmas. The company has recovered some credibility with investors by delivering 
better-thanexpected results since last January so it will be a setback if the holiday quarter disappoints.
Sony executives have made positive comments about Christmas sales, suggesting that flat-panel televisions, Blu-
ray players and e-readers all sold well, while the company has announced that it sold 3.8m PlayStation 3 consoles 
during the holiday season, up 76 per cent on last year.
Investors will expect an update on Sony's restructuring programme and will also be keen to hear how much it 
expects to gain from recent strength in the South Korean won, the currency of Samsung, its main rival.
Beyond the immediate figures, the question will be whether Sony gives any update on its plans for future growth, 
but Sir Howard Stringer, chairman and chief executive, is not scheduled to speak at the results briefing.

Monex, a multi-currency and card processing company based in Kerry, has agreed a deal with car rental brand 
Hertz. Estimated to be worth  4.5 million, the three-year agreement is for the provision of multi-currency treasury 
management software to Hertz operations in Europe.
The deal will enable Hertz to offer more efficient over-the counter foreign exchange services to its customers.
Using Monex's Customer Preferred Currency Conversion (CPCC) software, Hertz customers will be able to convert 
transactions in all locations into the currency normally used on their credit card, providing real-time price 
transparency.
A total of 14Monex jobs will be created over the life of the contract. The majority will be based at the company's 
headquarters in Killarney.
''The Hertz deal is an important contract for Monex as it associates our service offering with another major blue-chip 
global business and internationally recognised customer brand," said Frank Murphy, chief executive of Monex. 
''Monex has set itself ambitious targets for new business development across our prime target market, the 
international hospitality and travel sector.
''The Hertz contract will further reinforce our position as the leading provider of foreign currency management 
systems to international businesses in the sector. I'm confident that the Monex service will have a very positive 
impact on the Hertz business and its customers."
Established in 1997, Monex Financial Services processes more than 46 million transactions annually, handling 
payments valued at  8 billion.
The company employs 150 people in Ireland and overseas in Britain, America, Australia, Hong Kong, Shanghai, 
Beijing and Singapore. It had revenues of  38 million in 2008. Monex recently signed a licensing agreement to 
supply software to Dublin Airport Authority's three duty-free shops.

Farce at Dublin Airport
Ryanair's decision to cut back Dublin capacity this year by a further 20 per cent had nothing at all to do with 
'demand' and everything to do with 'cost' (Comment, Money & Markets, 24/1/10).
Last year, when the government imposed its  10 tourist tax, we warned that it would have a damaging effect on 
traffic to and from Ireland. We were right. Traffic at Dublin Airport last year fell by 13 per cent (a loss of over three 
million passengers), although demand as measured by Ryanair's traffic and load factor was up, as we took more 
traffic from competitors.
What was the response of government to this record traffic decline?
In November, Noel Dempsey, our transport minister ordered - yes, ordered - the supposedly independent aviation 
regulator to allow the DAA to increase its costs by 40 per cent in 2010, to compensate them for last year's decline in 
traffic and the  1.2 billion cost of the Terminal 2 white elephant.
Is it any wonder that airlines are switching capacity out of Dublin in record numbers? In January alone, total seat 
capacity at Dublin Airport was 16 per cent lower than the previous year, with BA, Malev and others having pulled 
out altogether, and British Midland recently announcing a decision to cut its capacity by 50 per cent.
Ryanair is switching capacity out of Dublin to much lower cost airports in 'zero' tourist tax countries like Spain, Italy, 
the Netherlands and Belgium. This is also the reason why we are reducing our Shannon base from four to one 
aircraft this summer, with a loss of 1.3million passengers at Shannon.
Traffic at Dublin this year will fall below 18million,whereas capacity in the existing terminal is over 30 million. As 
Ryanair predicted, we don't need the second terminal, and we can't afford it.
Letters to the editor
This is just another spectacular cock-up by the DAA monopoly, aided and abetted by the incompetent Department 
of Transport. Perhaps as traffic implodes throughout this year, the press will pick up on this and stop peddling the 
DAA spin about ''weak demand'', when Ryanair is growing by seven million passengers each year.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive Ryanair
Mental health reform
The article 'Mental health in mind' (24/1/10) did not present a balanced picture of the reform of the mental health 
services.
Many reforms which have yet to be introduced elsewhere in the health services - such as regulation, independent 
inspection and annual reporting, reliable information on admissions and discharges and active involvement of 
service users - have been introduced in the mental health services in recent years.
I fully accept that the implementation of A Vision For Change has been slower than originally anticipated.
However, significant steps have been taken. The number of inpatient beds for children under 18 has more than 
doubled to 30 since 2007.There are 55 child and adolescent mental health teams. Nine additional beds in the 
Central Mental Hospital and a six-place step-down residence in West Dublin have been developed since 2005.
Shorter episodes of inpatient care have been achieved, and half of discharges occur within two weeks of admission. 
There are fewer involuntary admissions.
Executive clinical directors in psychiatry have been appointed to lead reform in areas serving populations of 
350,000 to 400,000. In 2010, the HSE will dispose of surplus assets and reinvest an initial sum of  43 million in 
developing a new mental health infrastructure.
I recognise that there are challenges ahead, and that remodelling existing resources will be the main focus for the 
immediate future.
Other challenges include addressing the geographical imbalance in the distribution of current resources and the 
need to provide accommodation for mental health service users in their communities.
John Moloney TD Minister for Equality, Disability and Mental Health
Ineffective bank inquiry
The government's convoluted, evasive plans for a banking inquiry are a bucket of whitewash and a waste of time. 
They insult the electorate, who will bear the cost of the crisis without ever seeing and hearing exactly why and how 
it happened.
What we need is a new type of inquiry which is a mix of tribunal and commission, and provides for membership by 
politicians and others. It should have subpoena/ discovery powers, take evidence under oath, make findings, 
exclude lawyers, be open to the public and be televised.
It must be chaired by an independent person, engage expert support staff, hold private hearings by exception and 
have power to refer to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE), the Director of Public 
Prosecutions (DPP), the Garda Síochána and so on.
Brian Flanagan Blackrock, Co Dublin
* The question raised in your editorial (24/1/10), asking if the investigation into the banking crisis is ''for real'', is 
highly relevant. Holding the investigation behind closed doors is an effort to undermine the possibility of holding 
powerful people to account.
Letters to the editor
Government motivation for holding the inquiry out of the vulgar gaze of the peasants is to ensure that the peasants 
will not be allowed to find out what their lords and masters were up to. The peasants may have to pay the bill, but 
they will not be allowed to find out how the lords and masters bankrupted the country.
A Leavy Sutton, Dublin 13
* What questions will the banking inquiry ask that we don't already know the answers to?
How did the crisis happen? Answer:
the banks gave unsafe loans to developers. The world recession hit and the loans cannot be repaid. Who is 
responsible? Answer: the banks and developers. Will the stance of any bank or developer be changed by this 
inquiry?
Answer: absolutely not. Some of these questions and answers may change a little, but one definite answer to the 
question of who is going to pay for the inquiry is, yes, the poor taxpayer again.

Merits of a 'list' system
In your front page article regarding Fine Gael's plans for a shake-up of the Irish electoral system (24/1/10), Enda 
Kenny suggests changing to a version of the Scandinavian list system and dropping the Seanad entirely.
Changing to the list system - used not only by the Scandinavian countries, but also by the Netherlands, Switzerland 
and New Zealand - is not an original suggestion, as this subject was dealt with extensively by Dr Ed Walsh in his 
article in your paper on November 15.
The leader of Fine Gael, however, neglected to point out the most important aspect of the list system - that 
members of parliament are elected partially from local constituencies and partially from party lists of individuals who 
have proven records of distinguished national and international achievement, many from business and the 
professions.
When a government is being formed in these countries, the prime minister has available a rich pool of proven talent 
from which to select a government.
Imagine, if you can, a government with Michael O'Leary as Minister for Transport and Gerry Robinson as Minister 
for Health.
We can but dream.
Eamonn Ashe Drogheda, Co Louth
Inadequate childcare
Thank you for your article, 'Suffer the little children' (Agenda, 24/1/ 10), highlighting the issue of the unacceptably 
high number of separated children going missing from state care. As citizens and taxpayers, we must demand 
accountability for this terrible negligence.
Do we want this to be the subject of a Ryan-style report in 20 years?
We will not be able to claim ignorance of this situation when those who are children now ask us why we did nothing. 
It has been reported. We must demand action.

Dog legislation is welcome
Letters to the editor
The long-awaited Puppy Farming Bill that is being added to our Irish animal protection legislation is a much-needed 
and vital piece of legislation. We have all seen the results of the SPCA raids on dog breeding farms throughout 
Ireland:
dogs living in horrendous conditions in their own excrement with improper nourishment and housing, and no 
veterinary care.
What person in their right mind would object to allowing gardaí and animal protection groups more access and 
powers to punish the offenders who perpetrate crimes against defenceless pups and dogs?

Mueller on the march
Mueller on the march
Sunday Business Post
January 31, 2010

Section: THE MARKET
Length: 825 words
Body
Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph Mueller took his first big risk last week. While his five-month stint has already 
featured potentially controversial moves - including an aggressive cost reduction programme and scaling back 
capacity on selected routes - he had little choice on either front, and few chief executives would have acted 
differently.
Last week, however, Mueller put his judgment on the line with a bold move to break away from the low-cost strategy 
pursued by his predecessors, Dermot Mannion and Willie Walsh.
Instead of continuing with the airline's current efforts to emulate Ryanair as much as it possibly can, Mueller figured 
that an inability to match his rival's exceptionally low cost base was most likely to end in a protracted slugging 
match that could only have one winner.
With higher unit costs, Aer Lingus could not discount as aggressively as Ryanair, so any attempt to compete on 
price alone was unlikely to succeed. However, whether Mueller's new strategy is any more effective remains to be 
seen.
In shaping his new vision, he also identified that Aer Lingus would struggle to make it as a fully-fledged, full service 
carrier.
While the pure low-cost model was ''not sustainable'' in his view, the full-service model was ''not competitive''.
Full-service carriers tend to rely on a sizeable chunk of business travellers, a category that Mueller noted was in 
relatively short supply on routes to and from Ireland.
The Irish market also offered few opportunities to capture short-haul connections and, conditioned from years of 
Ryanair-driven price wars, was unlikely to respond well to an airline that positioned itself as a premium operator.
Mueller on the march
History is on his side. The airline repeatedly flirted with bankruptcy in its semi-state days, when it offered all the frills 
that Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary made it his business to root out.
As Aer Lingus was unsuccessful in the past as both a full-service and low-cost airline, Mueller opted instead for a 
middle ground - one that would see his airline offer what he termed a low-cost service ''with a little extra''.
The new strategy means that the door is now open for Aer Lingus to rejoin a major global alliance and tweak its 
offering to justify charging a premium over Ryanair's fares, in return for limited additional benefits that include, in 
Mueller's view, the chance to fly with ''Ireland's civilised airline''.
But Mueller was not around to discover Mannion's fondness for using the phrase ''neither fish nor fowl'' to warn of 
the future faced by Aer Lingus if it did not relinquish its high-cost base and fully commit to the low-cost model.
The decision to give up competing with Ryanair on price may seem logical to Mueller, but will only work if revenues 
rise accordingly.
While Mueller was at pains last week to stress that a radically lower cost base remained a priority, his new strategy 
runs the risk of malfunctioning if passengers who have grown accustomed to low fares refuse to bite and decide not 
to part with more cash in return for frills that they have learned to live without.
At a time when disposable income is under pressure and his main rival has resorted to giving seats away free in 
order to drum up demand, Mueller has formed a view that passengers are not as price-sensitive as O'Leary seems 
to think.
Mueller spoke last week of a near-vertical demand curve - in other words, that there is effectively no extra business 
to be gained from cutting prices further.
By contrast, the level of passenger demand would be unlikely to suffer unduly if prices increased within reason.
For Aer Lingus share holders, goodwill towards the new chief executive will rest on the success or otherwise of the 
new strategy. At the very least, it has bought Mueller time, as the impact of the new business model cannot be 
judged for a while It will also reassure shareholders by signalling that the new regime will seek to differentiate itself 
from the perceived lack of direction that plagued Mannion.
While Mannion's vision for Aer Lingus was one of low costs, he struggled to convince the markets that he could 
match tough talking with action, and left the airline with grand plans on costs left unfinished.
Mueller, meanwhile, offers greater certainty over the airline's future direction. Unlike Mannion, however, whose low 
fares policy looked intuitively correct, Mueller must convince his audience that opting for a middle-market strategy is 
the wiser long-term choice.
Last week's analysis offered a withering assessment of the Ryanair model as one which depended largely on 
O'Leary's famous post-September 11 deal with Boeing for cheap planes, and one that could not be repeated in the 
future.
It will help Mueller's case that such an argument (Ryanair got lucky and its low fares model cannot last) cannot be 
disproved for years. If passengers fail to respond to Mueller's new offering, however, he might not be around to be 
able to say: ''I told you so."

Body
Every air traveller wants the window or the aisle seat: it's the middle passenger who suffers the elbows. So too with 
the industry itself. In Europe, it has become polarised between large former flag carriers such as British Airways 
and aggressive low-cost rivals such as Ryanair and EasyJet. Squirming in the middle are carriers such as Ireland's 
Aer Lingus, Poland's Lot and TAP Portugal. It is no accident that they are all wholly or part-owned by governments, 
based in geographical locations that stymy their ability to act as regional hubs.
Aer Lingus epitomises this plight. Its customer base is driven primarily by tourism and a national diaspora fond of 
flying the flag. To build on that, new chief executive Christoph Mueller wants to make it Ireland's " civilised airline ". 
But Aer Lingus will have to shed, at last, the remaining slough of state ownership. A lingering "jobs for life" mentality 
has kept non-fuel costs circling at about 70 per cent of revenues; costs at Ryanair and EasyJet are about half of 
revenues. One alternative - a takeover by a global carrier - must have crossed Mr Mueller's mind, but is academic 
for now given Ryanair's blocking 29 per cent stake.
The Polish airline's lot is little better - except that its 93 per cent government shareholder can't wait to ditch it . 
Lufthansa, a serial consolidator in northern Europe and a co-member of the Star Alliance, is its most logical partner. 
TAP Portugal at least has an attractive franchise to former colonies in Africa and booming Brazil, plied by feeder 
traffic from Star. If it too can shrink costs, TAP may be viable as a niche operator. Others - geographically boxed in, 
strategically limited and burdened with high costs - face a short and uncomfortable one-way flight.

The main Dublin shares index dipped under the 3,000 mark this morning in line with world markets as banks

Global ratings agency, Standard and Poor's has issued a report on the Irish banks, making a number of rating 
changes to banks operating within Ireland. Of note was the one notch downgrade to both AIB and Bank of Ireland 
from A to A-. The outlook on AIB is negative while the outlook on BOI is stable. The negative outlook on AIB reflects 
its view that the quantum and the timing of capital raised may not be sufficient to support an A- rating. There was no 
rating change to Irish Life and Permanent (BBB+/Stable). Important to all guaranteed institutions, though, was the 
confirmation by S and P that any issuance under the guarantee will not be affected by the rating changes, said 
Goodbody Stockbrokers.
Shares in AIB fell by 6c to E1.29, Bank of Ireland dropped by 1c to E1.37 while Irish Life and Permanent was flat at 
E3.55. Cemex has reported a loss per share of USD0.22, which was ahead of consensus for losses of USD0.28.

Aer Lingus brands itself 'civilised' airline

Body
Aer Lingus yesterday declared itself "Ireland's civilised airline" as it unveiled a plan to position itself midway 
between Ryanair, its no-frills rival, and high-end carriers such as British Airways.
Shares in the lossmaking flag carrier initially rose as Christoph Mueller, its new chief executive, told investors in 
London of plans for a new business model that some analysts compared with that of Easyjet, Europe's second-
biggest low-cost airline.
While Aer Lingus hopes to lure business travellers with faster check-in times, pre-paid meals and central airports, 
rather than the secondary ones for which Ryanair is known, it will not focus on the quality lounges, free food and 
drinks associated with full-service airlines.
"You could say there's a shift towards an EasyJet model," said Joe Gill of Bloxham stockbrokers in Dublin, adding 
that investors seemed optimistic that the new strategy would start to deliver profits from 2011.
The airline's "civilised" tag will be seen as a dig at Ryanair, which has twice tried to buy Aer Lingus and remains its 
biggest shareholder with a stake of 29 per cent. Mr Mueller said the size of this holding remained a deterrent to 
other airlines who might wish to take a stake in Aer Lingus.
Mr Mueller, who started in the job nearly five months ago, has been trying to staunch losses suffered by the airline 
as it expanded during a recession that hit its three main markets of Ireland, the UK and the US.
He outlined a plan to achieve cost savings of EUR97m (£85m) a year by the end of 2011, in part by cutting staff 
numbers by nearly a fifth and removing several senior pilots who are among the airline's most expensive 
employees.
His presentation was an attempt to show investors how he hopes to improve revenue at the airline, which is 
expected to report a pre-tax loss of EUR108m for 2009. The airline burned through EUR400m gross cash last year 
Aer Lingus brands itself 'civilised' airline
but still has a strong balance sheet with gross cash and deposits of EUR825m, of which EUR770m is 
unencumbered.
"In a worst-case scenario, we can run for at least four and half years without running out of cash," Mr Mueller told 
the Financial Times.
However, Aer Lingus said market conditions would remain "extremely challenging" this year with the first half being 
very weak, partly thanks to low bookings following bad January weather. The shares were flat at 68 cent.

of the Union address by Barak Obama, which is expected to signal bid bidget cutbacks.
Banks have also been hit this morning by a profit fall unveiled by Spain's second-largest bank BBVA. In Dublin, all

The EU Commission today said it has closed an investigation into a deal between Ryanair and the Bratislava airport 
operator over allegations of state aid to the Irish airline.
Ryanair said the closure is confirmation that its agreement with Bratislava airport does not involve any State aid.
"This decision marks another successful conclusion of a State aid investigation involving Ryanair, in addition to the 
Charleroi judgment in December 2008," it said.
The commission said the terms of deal, in which the airport operator agreed to cover some of Ryanair's costs, didn't 
give Ryanair an unfair advantage over its competitors. Rival airlines in recent years have attacked Ryanair's 
agreements with airports, saying they violate European Union antitrust rules. The commission, the EU's regulatory 
arm, said it has seven other ongoing investigations involving Ryanair. It said the decision to close the Bratislava 
airport investigation doesn't mean it will drop these other cases.

Body
Aer Lingus has predicted a further fall in full year revenues this year in the face of what it calls "extremely 
challenging" market conditions.
In a statement to the stock market, ahead of an investor presentation today, the airline says it expects the first half 
of the year to be particularly weak.
"The severe weather conditions of January 2010 have resulted in a lower than expected level of bookings for the 
first quarter of 2010," it says.
It says fuel costs should be lower this year, though this will be partially offset by a likely 20m euro increase in airport 
charges. The carrier currently expects its cost reduction programme to deliver 44m euro in benefits in the 2010 
financial year, but it stops short of giving any guidance on profit or loss. The airline also effectively confirms that it is 
giving up its ambition to compete against Ryanair on fares, saying it will "leverage its substantial product and 
service strengths while generating a premium to the lowest fare in the markets in which it operates". It adds that 
adjustments to its revenue management model will be supported by investment in a streamlined, integrated 
information computer platform "capable of supporting the evolving Aer Lingus business model". The airline, which 
this morning announced a brand sharing agreement with Aer Arann, says it will also seeking to enhance its existing 
partner network to improve long haul connectivity, particularly to Asia. The cost of redundancies will be around 40m 
euros in 2010, it says. The airline says it has hedged 67pc of estimated 2010 fuel purchases by the end of last 
month at a rate of USD772 per tonne and 16pc of its estimated 2011 requirements at a rate of USD762 per tonne. It 
says it has a strong balance sheet, with gross cash and deposits at the end of last month of 825m euro. "The group 
has more than sufficient liquidity to meet both its short-term and medium-term capital expenditure and lease 
repayment requirements," it insists.

Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said today he believed the Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737-800 that crashed 
off Lebanon on Monday was operated by his airline until April last year.
He said Ryanair sold the plane in April 2009, without specifying the buyer.
"I think they had it in maintenance, they did some work on it, between April and May. I think they leased it to 
Ethiopian in September, and something happened to it. We are not sure yet, but it may have been that aircraft that 
was involved in the accident yesterday".
"What happened we don't know. It's a bit like you selling your car and 11 months later the new person driving it has 
a crash. It had nothing to do with us," the airline's CEO told Reuters after a news conference in Rome. Ethiopian 
Airlines says the eight-year-old plane was leased from a division of U.S. financing company CIT Group and had its 
last routine maintenance on Dec. 25. The plane crashed into the sea with 90 people on board minutes after taking 
off from Beirut in stormy weather early on Monday and there were no reports of survivors. Ethiopian Airlines said 
the Boeing 737-800, a recent version of Boeing's best-selling model, left the U.S. factory in 2002. The airline said it 
leased the aircraft in September 2009 from CIT Aerospace, part of CIT Group.

(ANSA)   ROME, JANUARY 26  - Ryanair is continuing its expansion  plan in Italy with the opening in May of five 
new routes, and  this year the company aims to reach a total of 22 million  passengers carried on the network to 
and from Italy, thus  overtaking Alitalia.  The news was announced by the CEO of the  Irish budget airline, Michael 
O Leary in a meeting with  journalists in which it was pointed out that the 2009-2010  investment plan for Italy totals 
1.4 billion dollars.  More in detail, the expansion of the network which in Italy is  spread between 10 bases for a total 
of 295 routes (to and from  Italy) is for three new routes from Milan Orio al Serio (which  are to be announced in the 
coming hours), one from Turin and one  from Treviso, both of which for Ibiza. 
 O Leary, who did not want to make any preannouncements about the  2009 balance sheet which will be released 
next Monday, wanted    amongst other things   to underline that Ryanair traffic in  Italy went up by 35% in 2009 and 
that the punctuality of the  company s flights was 93%.  Against the increases in airport  taxes, O Leary instead said 
that  airports must lower their  costs in order to grow.    With regard to the dispute with ENAC (Italian Civil Aviation  
Authority) over passengers  identity documents, Ryanair s CEO  said that he was satisfied with the agreement 
reached with ENAC  which stipulates that the airline will only accept passports,  identity cards and government 
badges, whilst it excludes driving  licences and any other type of document, a practice which it  applies in all other 
European countries where the airline  operates, above all as a guarantee of security given that  check-in is done 
online.  In relation to security, and to body scanners in particular,  O Leary observed that every time there is an 
emergency,   politicians and bureaucrats intervene so that they are seen   but  the problem does not exist on 
domestic or European flights,  whilst these instruments are suitable for flights to the US and  transatlantic flights.

It was another lacklustre day's trading on the ISEQ with the index moving further away from the 3,100 mark after 
weak US housing data.
The index fell 20.91 points to 3,016.03.
Shares in CRH did most to keep the market negative with the stock down 14c to E17.62. Goodbody Stockbrokers 
said that there is a growing perception that CRH has missed the boat on acquisitions (especially a larger deal), 
which has been a critical driver of growth for the group in the past. However, analyst Robert Eason said "we have 
been here before, back in 2001 after a similar rights issue, but CRH did deliver subsequently". "We see no reason 
to believe it is different this time. Its 25-year contact database underpins its proven bolt-on strategy, no 
opportunities were missed in the last 12 months and the company's balance sheet is strong. Therefore, CRH's 
acquisition run-rate can normalise back to historical levels. In the past it has spent on average 20pc of the capital 
base acquiring businesses versus a low single-digit percentage run-rate in 2009. Indeed, activity levels did pick-up 
in Q4 for CRH, a factor we believe the market has not appreciated. Normalisation of its trend investment spend 
could add over 30pc to earnings over a five year period."
Bank stocks were mixed with AIB down 2c to E1.39, Bank of Ireland edged down 1c to E1.42 while Irish Life and 
Permanent climbed 1c to E3.50. The government is set to rent thousands of empty houses from NAMA and rent 
them out as social housing, according to a weekend report. Talks have already taken place on the matter between 
the bad bank and the Department of the Environment, the reports say. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) in the UK 
said on Friday that it is reviewing the C and C acquisition of Gaymer to see whether it might result in a lessening of 
competition in the UK market. Most deals of reasonable size are routinely reviewed by the OFT and we would not 
anticipate any major alternations to the deal. Following the acquisition, C and C's share of the UK cider market

the overall GB LAD market, moreover, is only 3pc (excluding Tennents lager, which would add another 3pc). C and

growth of 14pc with loads increasing by 1 percentage point. There should be continuing strong performance on 
costs, said Davy. "We assume ex-fuel costs down 4.9pc and unit fuel down 46pc. However, the key focus will be

Shares in CRH did most to keep the market negative with the stock down 14c to E17.62. Goodbody Stockbrokers 
said that there is a growing perception that CRH has missed the boat on acquisitions (especially a larger deal),

to believe it is different this time. Its 25-year contact database underpins its proven bolt-on strategy, no 
opportunities were missed in the last 12 months and the company's balance sheet is strong. Therefore, CRH's 
acquisition run-rate can normalise back to historical levels. In the past it has spent on average 20pc of the capital 
base acquiring businesses versus a low single-digit percentage run-rate in 2009. Indeed, activity levels did pick-up

Section: THE MARKET
Length: 851 words
Body
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary is always consistent. Last week, he once again consistently pointed out 
the ludicrousness of the air traffic controllers' strike which brought the country's airports to a standstill for several 
hours. O'Leary never minces his words and spoke very plainly about the situation. When it comes to criticising state 
companies, trade unions and the government, he is often right.
However, he was also consistent last week in blaming the government for his decision to cut services from Dublin 
Airport and shed staff.
O'Leary's successful berating of the government on matters of industrial relations, Aer Lingus and the second 
terminal at Dublin Airport get mixed up with his consistent approach to blaming the government for every piece of 
bad news the company announces.
Last week, Ryanair blamed airport charges and the government's  10 travel tax for its decision to shed 150 jobs. 
The decision will result in a 20 per cent fall in numbers at Dublin Airport, bringing them down to about 6.5 million in 
the year to March 2011.
Surely, O'Leary must accept that he is cutting capacity and jobs because demand does not warrant it. Is it credible 
to blame the  10 travel tax in this case?
When it comes to the second terminal at Dublin Airport, O'Leary is shooting fish in a barrel at this stage. Anyone 
using the airport can't help but notice how relatively uncrowded the current facilities are, and how they are 
overshadowed by this enormous, expensive, high-spec new terminal.
But is it really the Dublin Airport Authority's fault that the second terminal is set to be ready in the middle of a 
massive downturn? The old Aer Rianta wanted to build the second terminal years ago but it was delayed because 
of an ideological stand-off in cabinet between Bertie Ahern and the Progressive Democrats over who should own 
and run the second terminal. The row delayed the project by several years.
Comment
If it had been built sooner, by whoever, it would still be facing a downturn, but customers at the airport would have 
enjoyed some benefits in the few years preceding the slowdown.
If it had been built by Ryanair, the competition between the two terminals would by now have reached fever pitch 
and probably would have benefited consumers.
Greencore to cut malting barley deals
People having less money in their pockets points to less consumption of beer and spirits. That is borne out by 
Greencore's desire to reduce its malting barley tonnage requirements from producers. Reports last week suggested 
that the food group is seeking to cut tonnage contracts by 25 per cent for the coming season.
This points to an overhang in terms of supplies, which presumably reflects a slowdown in demand from the 
product's end users - beer and spirit makers. According to NCB Stockbrokers, the move to reduce commitments is 
not surprising given the levels of stocks backing up throughout the supply industry globally and the ''continuing 
weak spot price for malting barley''.
None of this is particularly bad news for Greencore, as its malting margins are protected by what NCB calls high-
priced forward sales. However, there had been some discussions or approach regarding a possible buyer for the 
malt business.
This changing environment in the sector generally could reduce either the level of interest of a potential buyer or the 
price they might be willing to pay for the business.
Greencore chief executive Patrick Coveney may not need to sell the malt business, but a good price for it would 
have been helpful. That is something that may just have to wait.
Weber firm bucks the trend
It is interesting to see Brian Weber's Quilter wealth management operation expanding in these tough times with the 
appointment of John McElroy as investment manager last week. McElroy joins Quilter from Goodbody 
Stockbrokers, where he spent ten years working as a portfolio manager.
The move brings to 12 the number of people employed at Quilter, which Weber set up in 2003 when he quit Davy 
Stockbrokers, where he had been a director in the private clients division.
Word on the street is that the high-profile losses suffered by Davy investors on the likes of the Irish Glass Bottle site 
and Barry O'Callaghan's Educational Media and Publishing Group (EMPG) may present an opportunity for smaller 
wealth managers such as Quilter to pick up new business from disgruntled Davy clients.
Weber was one of the first stockbrokers to sound warnings about property concentration risks among Irish 
investors. As far back as 2006, he was saying that investors were putting too many of their eggs in the property 
basket. He told The Sunday Business Post in February that year that Irish property prices would slow.
''The growth on property we have seen in the last couple of years is unsustainable,"' saidWeber. ''But one thing that 
worries me is the level of belief in property as an asset class. People need to look at diversification."
Quilter provides bespoke and discretionary investment management to private clients, charities and trusts and 
employs about 300 staff based in ten offices throughout Ireland, Britain and Jersey.

Ryanair today claimed victory over screenscrapers in Germany after a court there ruled that reselling Ryanair's 
flights is unlawful and banned a German website Vtours from screenscraping Ryanair's website.
Today's ruling against Vtours cements the decision handed down in Hamburg last May, which ruled that the 
scraping of Ryanair.com to resell Ryanair tickets is unlawful.
Vtours is now permanently banned from reselling Ryanair flights to consumers.
Ryanair has taken several high profile cases against screenscrapers throughout Europe as part of its long running 
campaign to try to stop their anti-consumer practices. These online resellers access Ryanair's website in breach of 
its Terms of Use, take its flight information and sell Ryanair tickets to consumers, with high additional charges, 
which are not made clear to the consumer, the Irish airline said. "Ryanair celebrates today's victory for German 
consumers as it once again confirms that European courts support Ryanair's fight to protect consumers against 
overcharging screenscraping ticket-touts. Ryanair will continue its fight against screenscrapers in the interests of 
passengers until this practice of misleading consumers has been outlawed across Europe. Today's result is a 
milestone achievement in that fight," said Ryanair's Stephen McNamara.

News In Brief
## AIB and Bank of Ireland need to raise a minimum of E10.3bn between them in order to bolster their reserves, 
according to analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland . The funds would be required in the face of expected NAMA 
writedowns and loan losses clocking up on the two banks' remaining loan books. RBS estimates the banks will 
each have to go through two rounds of capital raising and asset sales to reach the target. It also expects that E4bn 
of the government's E7.5bn-worth of preference shares in the two banks combined will end up being converted into 
ordinary equity as part of the process. The analysts assume the government will be the only source of cash in the 
first round -- converting preference shares into ordinary stock at a 58pc discount to the current market price. This 
would leave the State with effective 40pc ownership of AIB and 41pc of BoI. - Irish Independent
## Ryanair said yesterday that fares out of Ireland are likely to rise by "at least 10 per cent" this year. At a press 
conference in Dublin, chief executive Michael O'Leary said the airline would reduce the number of aircraft based in 
Dublin from 18 to 15 during its summer schedule, which begins on March 28th. "There will be no free seats out of 
Ireland this year," he said. "I doubt there'll be any seat sales below E10." - Irish Times
## The former home of the late minister and writer, Conor Cruise O'Brien, is to be handed back to lender Irish 
Nationwide after the current owners failed to repay a mortgage of more than E1.4m. Patrick Cruise O'Brien and his 
sister, Margaret -- the adopted children of Cruise O'Brien and his wife Maire Mhac an tSaoi -- are to give back the 
keys of the luxury Dublin home to the building society. The brother and sister owe tens of thousands of euro in 
repayment arrears and legal costs. The house, formerly known as Bayview but now known as Whitewater, sits on 
Howth Summit. It is still the home of Ms Mhac an tSaoi. - Irish Independent ## Exxon Mobil, the largest US energy 
company, is offering stakes in two natural gas fields off the Irish coast for sale to help fund exploratory drilling there. 
The Dunquin North and Dunquin South prospects hold combined recoverable reserves of 8.4 trillion cubic feet of

according to analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland . The funds would be required in the face of expected NAMA 
writedowns and loan losses clocking up on the two banks' remaining loan books. RBS estimates the banks will 
each have to go through two rounds of capital raising and asset sales to reach the target. It also expects that E4bn 
of the government's E7.5bn-worth of preference shares in the two banks combined will end up being converted into 
ordinary equity as part of the process. The analysts assume the government will be the only source of cash in the 
first round -- converting preference shares into ordinary stock at a 58pc discount to the current market price. This 
would leave the State with effective 40pc ownership of AIB and 41pc of BoI. - Irish Independent

Ryanair to slash Dublin flights, blasts high costs
Ryanair to slash Dublin flights, blasts high costs

Body
Ryanair, Ireland's major airline, announced Thursday it will slash its Dublin flights by 19 percent this summer and 
cut 150 jobs in protest at airport fees and an Irish government passenger tax.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary blamed government-regulated charges, rather than Ireland's recession, for a rapid 
fall over the past year in Irish traffic. The Dublin Airport Authority, however, dismissed Ryanair's figures as 
inaccurate and its rhetoric as bogus.
Ryanair said its Dublin flights would fall 19 percent to below 500 per week starting in April, resulting in 2 million 
fewer passengers this year compared with 2009. The carrier, headquartered in Dublin, estimated this cutback would 
mean 2,000 lost jobs in airline support services but declined to provide details.
Analysts said Ryanair appeared to be applying a crude multiplier that presumes every 1,000 Ryanair passengers 
underpins one job.
Europe's most profitable airline has railed for years against the Dublin Airport Authority and its slow development of 
a second terminal at the capital's overcrowded airport. Ryanair, the airport's major tenant, has insisted it needs only 
Spartan facilities and blames the project due to open in November for a government-approved 40 percent rise in 
charges.
O'Leary also blamed the government's (EURO)10 ($14) tax charged per passenger for frightening tourists away 
from Ireland.
But the airport's managers accused Ryanair of grossly distorting figures and misleading the public about its true 
economic reason the recession for pruning Dublin flights to business destinations.
The Dublin Airport Authority said it would increase charges 23 percent this year to (EURO)9.32 ($13.11) per 
passenger, not 40 percent, after years of no increases. It said the new fee levels would remain 25 percent below 
European norms.
Ryanair to slash Dublin flights, blasts high costs
The authority contrasted this with Ryanair's own rapidly escalating regime of fees for checking bags, using credit 
and debit cards, and changing bookings.
"It seems odd that an airline that regularly charges passengers (EURO)10 ($14) each for the privilege of paying for 
a return flight by credit card should argue that this change will cause a seismic shift in travel patterns," the authority 
said in reference to its own imminent fee hike.
The authority said Ryanair was being "hugely short-sighted" for criticizing the airport's expansion as excessive. It 
said the second terminal would make Dublin Airport comfortable for travelers "for many decades to come" and 
would "help position Ireland to take full advantage of the upturn when it comes."
Ryanair is increasingly redeploying its fleet of Boeing 787-400s away from the highly competitive British-Irish arena 
to lower-charge regional airports in continental Europe. New Ryanair bases opening this year include Faro in 
Portugal, Malaga in Spain, and Bari and Brindisi in Italy.
But analysts agree that these shifts represent aggressive moves to build new markets, with lower fees a bonus.
Reflecting that opportunism, Ryanair announced Thursday that despite its claim of high fees driving airline business 
out of Dublin it would introduce 37 new flights per week this summer linking Dublin to Mediterranean and Atlantic 
sun spots.
This move follows the collapse two months ago of Budget Travel, Ireland's largest package-holiday operator, which 
specialized in charter flights out of Ireland. Ryanair said it would more than double its Dublin flights to Barcelona, 
Spain, and open two new routes to the Canary Islands.
The Dublin Airport Authority said this move shows that Ryanair is lying about its reasons for cutting routes overall.
"A passenger pays the same charge at Dublin Airport whether they are flying to Malaga or to Manchester," it said. 
"Ryanair is making these changes to suit Ryanair's own financial position, as is always the case."
Ryanair shares rose 1.5 percent to (EURO)3.45 ($4.85) amid a flat market on the Irish Stock Exchange.

The ISEQ failed once again to reach of the 3,100 level with banks sharply lower and with a CRH rebound fizzling 
out in afternoon trade.
The ISEQ fell 42.66 points to 3,044.87.
European markets mirrored the Irish index, with weakness in banks as investors reacted badly to news that US 
President Obama vowed to rein in the biggest U.S. banks, proposing new limits on their trading practices and their 
ability to become too large. Obama said the new proposals would keep taxpayers from being ''held hostage'' by 
banks that have become too big to fail and that pose a risk to the entire financial system.
CRH did little to keep the ISEQ out of the red with the stock gaining just 5c to E18.00. The latest figures from the 
US - CRH's biggest single market - show that contract awards for highways and bridges increased by 11pc in 
December, which compares to 0pc in November and +15pc in October. This was driven by the bridge component 
(+35pc), as highways was relatively weak for the second month in a row (-2pc in December and -5pc in November). 
While highways has been benefiting from stimulus funds (USD5.6bn paid out to the end of December), it is being 
offset by the fact that the multi-year highways programme is being administered under short term extensions, which 
is causing uncertainty and delaying funds being committed to projects, Goodbody Stockbrokers noted. Shares in 
Ryanair jumped 5c to E3.44 after it said today that it plans to cut its flights and traffic at Dublin Airport this summer 
by up to 20pc, blaming rising airport costs and the Government's E10 air fare tax and saying that the cuts will see 
2,150 jobs go. The no-frills airline is reducing the number of aircraft based at the airport from 18 last summer to 15 
for Summer 2010 while passenger traffic will be cut from 8.7m travellers last year to around 6.5m in the year to 
March 2011. It said that the cuts will result in the loss of 150 Ryanair jobs (pilots, crew and engineers) and over 
2,000 support jobs at Dublin Airport. However, Ryanair will increase the number of flights on a number of routes to

USD1.04 (up 13pc) was well ahead of analysts' expectations of an EPS of around USD0.90. Among the highlights, 
net interest income was up 15pc compared to the same period last year and 2pc sequentially, helped by the 10

Ryanair this morning said that it plans to cut its flights and traffic at Dublin Airport this summer by up to 20pc,

Ryanair this morning said that it plans to cut its flights and traffic at Dublin Airport this summer by up to 20pc, 
blaming rising airport costs and the Government's E10 air fare tax and saying that the cuts will see 2,150 jobs go.
The no-frills airline is reducing the number of aircraft based at the airport from 18 last summer to 15 for Summer 
2010 while passenger traffic will be cut from 8.7m travellers last year to around 6.5m in the year to March 2011.
It said that the cuts will result in the loss of 150 Ryanair jobs (pilots, crew and engineers) and over 2,000 support 
jobs at Dublin Airport.
However, Ryanair will increase the number of flights on a number of routes to popular holiday destinations in the 
peak summer months of June, July and August. The routes with extra flights include Alicante, the Canary Islands, 
Faro and Malaga. "Ireland in general, and Dublin Airport in particular, are now high cost destinations, compared to 
other European cities where airports are lowering costs and Govt's are scrapping tourist taxes. Ryanair's operations

The ISEQ continued to hover close to the 3,100 level for the third week in a row today with CRH recouping some of 
the losses it took on earlier this week.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 7.57 points to 3,095.10.
European markets as flat as the Irish index this morning, with weakness in banks and miners just offsetting gains in 
drug makers, as investors stayed cautious ahead of further company results from the US.
CRH did most to keep the ISEQ positive with the stock gaining 30c to E18.25. The latest figures from the US - 
CRH's biggest single market - show that contract awards for highways and bridges increased by 11pc in December, 
which compares to 0pc in November and +15pc in October. This was driven by the bridge component (+35pc), as 
highways was relatively weak for the second month in a row (-2pc in December and -5pc in November). While 
highways has been benefiting from stimulus funds (USD5.6bn paid out to the end of December), it is being offset by 
the fact that the multi-year highways programme is being administered under short term extensions, which is

Irish airline Ryanair plans to increase its fares at its Dublin hub and probably across its European network, chief 
executive Michael O'Leary was quoted as saying this morning.
O'Leary has told the Irish Times that average fares at Europe's biggest low-cost airline could rise from the 
beginning of its next financial year in April after four years of decline.
O'Leary is to hold a news conference later today to discuss changes to Ryanair's summer schedule from Dublin 
Airport.
"There will be an extensive range of frequency and capacity cuts (in Dublin) starting on the 28th of March," O'Leary 
told the newspaper. Ticket prices are closely watched by analysts and O'Leary said he would be surprised if they 
didn't go up by at least 5 to 10 percent out of Ireland. He blamed rising charges from the Dublin Airport Authority, 
but added average fares across the entire airline could rise from April 1. "We would hope that with fares having 
fallen by 20 per cent over the past 12 months (that) they would rise over the next 12 months, but I wouldn't hold my 
breath," he said.

Tense moments at the European air finance conference in Dublin where Ryanair finance director Howard Millar sat 
next to Boeing Capital Corporation aircraft finance boss Scott Scherer on the podium.
Only a few weeks ago, Mr Millar's boss Michael O'Leary accused the US aircraft maker of being "numpties" for 
failing to agree on a deal over 200 new jets.
Mr Millar said there were no plans to reopen talks, before Mr Scherer said he appreciated that Ryanair was going to 
"leave the door open" - even after being called "numpties" in public.
The Ryanair numbers man later said he wanted "to make absolutely clear" that the negotiations between the two 
companies had terminated.

120 flights canceled as Irish controllers protest
120 flights canceled as Irish controllers protest

More than 120 flights in and out of Ireland were canceled Wednesday when air traffic controllers staged a four-hour 
walkout in a bid for higher pay a protest that elicited little support outside the trade-union movement.
Government and business leaders condemned the controllers' protest as selfish at a time when cash-strapped 
Ireland is battling record debts, cutting pay and slashing jobs.
The government's minister for trade and commerce, Billy Kelleher, said the controllers' decision to shut down the 
runways at the nation's three main airports had ruined travel plans for 20,000 people and was "further undermining 
Ireland's economic viability and reputation."
The Irish Aviation Authority employs 300 controllers at Ireland's airports in Dublin, Cork and Shannon. In 2007, as 
part of a national wage-pact deal, the authority promised the controllers a 6 percent raise.
But the authority has put that raise on hold until at least 2012 once Ireland's deepening recession unraveled the 
wage pact. It also pressed controllers to begin making payments into their own guaranteed pension funds, a 
sacrifice already made by most sectors of the Irish work force.
The controllers' union, Impact, warned that its members would cause more runway shutdowns unless the aviation 
authority abandons its pension-money demands and delivers the pay increase now. The union also seeks extra pay 
for controllers to use recently upgraded air-traffic-control technology.
Liam Kavanagh, the Irish Aviation Authority's head of human resources, said the controllers were being greedy and 
unreasonable.
Kavanagh said on average each controller received (EURO)160,000 ($225,000) in salary and company-funded 
pension payments, worked 35-hour weeks with frequent half-hour breaks, and got 46 days' vacation and 137 rest 
days a year.
He said the Irish-based airlines, principally loss-making Aer Lingus and cutthroat but profitable Ryanair, funded the 
authority's work in full.
120 flights canceled as Irish controllers protest
"The airlines cannot afford to pay any increases in the current economic climate. The aviation industry is on its 
knees," he said.
Aer Lingus said it canceled 64 flights Wednesday, Ryanair 48, and small regional airline Aer Arann five. Scores of 
other flights were delayed for hours, with many midmorning flights rescheduled for the evening.
International flights that normally travel through Irish air space also had to alter their routes, avoiding Ireland, during 
the disruption.
Aer Lingus which has been cutting its own pay levels and staff in a bid to return to profit said it supported the 
authority's stand against the controllers' demands. Ryanair lambasted the controllers as "overpaid and 
underworked," and called on grounded customers to phone and e-mail complaints to the Impact union 
headquarters.
The Irish Business and Employers Confederation, which represents 7,000 employers nationwide, said it was 
"outrageous that the public is being held to ransom in this way."
Transport Minister Noel Dempsey told lawmakers the government would consider making it illegal for air traffic 
controllers and other providers of emergency services to strike.

runways at the nation's three main airports had ruined travel plans for 20,000 people and was "further undermining 
Ireland's economic viability and reputation."
But the protesters' union spokesman, Michael Landers, said that unless employers backed down, "there will be 
further work stoppages, and we do expect that to happen sooner rather than later."
The Irish Aviation Authority employs 300 controllers at Ireland's airports in Dublin, Cork and Shannon. In 2007, as 
part of a national wage-pact deal, the authority promised the controllers a 6 percent raise.
But the authority put that raise on hold until at least 2012 when Ireland's deepening recession unraveled the wage 
pact. It also asked controllers to begin making payments into their own guaranteed pension funds, a sacrifice 
already made by most sectors of the Irish work force.
The controllers' union, Impact, says the controllers won't agree to contribute even though their pension plan has a 
deficit exceeding (EURO)230 million.
Besides the 6 percent raise, Impact also is seeking extra pay for controllers to use newly installed air-traffic-control 
technology and demanding that the authority restore to the payroll about 20 controllers who have refused this week 
to operate the new systems. Impact argues that the new technology will mean more stress and a bigger workload.
Liam Kavanagh, the Irish Aviation Authority's head of human resources, said the controllers were being greedy and 
unreasonable.
150 flights canceled as Irish controllers protest
Kavanagh said on average each controller received (EURO)160,000 ($225,000) in salary and company-funded 
pension payments, worked 35-hour weeks with frequent half-hour breaks, and got 46 days' vacation and 137 rest 
days a year.
He said the Irish-based airlines, principally loss-making Aer Lingus and cutthroat but profitable Ryanair, funded the 
authority's work in full.
"The airlines cannot afford to pay any increases in the current economic climate. The aviation industry is on its 
knees," he said.
Aer Lingus said it canceled 64 flights Wednesday, Ryanair 48, and small regional airline Aer Arann five. Scores of 
other flights were delayed for hours, with many midmorning flights unable to leave until nightfall.
International flights that normally travel through Irish air space also altered their routes, avoiding Ireland, during the 
disruption.
Aer Lingus which has been cutting its own pay levels and staff in a bid to return to profit said it supported the 
authority's stand against the controllers' demands. Ryanair lambasted the controllers as "overpaid and 
underworked," and called on grounded customers to phone and e-mail complaints to the Impact union 
headquarters.
The Irish Business and Employers Confederation, which represents 7,000 employers nationwide, said it was 
"outrageous that the public is being held to ransom in this way."
Transport Minister Noel Dempsey told lawmakers the government would consider making it illegal for air traffic 
controllers and other providers of emergency services to strike.

Thousands of air travellers face disruption today as a result of industrial action by air traffic controllers at Ireland's 
three main airports.
Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports will grind to halt between 2pm and 6pm as controllers attend mandatory union 
meetings.
Ryanair has cancelled 48 flights, affecting 6,000 passengers, while Aer Lingus has pulled 64 flights, affecting 7,000 
passengers.
The action follows the suspension of 15 air traffic controllers for failing to co-operate with new technology. The 
action will also affect flights through Irish airspace. The controllers' employer, the Irish Aviation Authority, has 
apologised for the disruption. "Work stoppages like those proposed for today cause distraction and uncertainty," it 
says in a statement. "We cannot operate a crucial and safety-critical service in an environment of uncertainty. We 
need the full assurance that all controllers are prepared to carry out all assigned duties." It calls on the controllers to 
resume normal working practices, to suspend a 6 pc pay claim, and to make a contribution towards their pension in 
line with all other public service workers. "They are among the best paid public servants in the country," the 
statement says. "On average, they cost the Irish Aviation Authority 160,000 euro each. Earnings for the top ten per 
cent of controllers in the country last year ranged from 170,000 euro to 230,000 euro. "They work 182 days a year, 
they have 137 rest days, and 36 days holidays - in addition to 10 public holidays. "They work a 35 hour week. They 
are entitled to a break of 30 minutes for every two hours worked. They work five days and then get three days off. 
"We want them to be reasonable and suspend discussion of this 6 per cent increase." The controllers' union Impact 
has said it will call off the action if the suspended workers are put back on the payroll. The union's assistant general 
secretary Michael Landers says Impact and the IAA agreed last week to discuss the matter at the Labour Court. 
"The status quo should be maintained," he says, "and staff should not be suspended until the court has ruled."

The ISEQ sank deeper in to the red yesterday with CRH - the biggest listing on the index by market cap - leading 
the decline.
Brokers analysts noted that the US architectural billings index, a lead indicator of future non-residential construction 
activity, improved marginally in December to 43.4 from 42.8 in November. A reading above 50 indicates an increase 
in billings. The index provides an approximate 9- to 12-month glimpse into future construction activity in the sector 
in the US. CRH is a large supplier of construction materials to the US non-residential construction sector primarily 
through its products and distribution divisions. Davy estimates that the segment will contribute about 16pc of group 
profit in 2010. CRH's shares fell 24c to E17.95.
Shares in DCC fell by 68c to E20.40. The report of the Irish High Court Inspector looking into specific issues relating 
to DCC's shareholding in Fyffes between 1995 and 2000 was published on Tuesday. In it, the inspector confirmed 
that no further action would be taken against DCC, any of its employees or former CEO Jim Flavin in relation to the 
affair.
Bank of Ireland yesterday announced the deferral of coupons on its outstanding subordinated Tier 1 and Upper Tier 
2 instruments. The deferral - as a result of European Commission (EC) requirements - was as expected following a 
similar announcement by Allied Irish Banks back in December. According to the EC, in compliance with state aid

150 Irish flights to be hit by air-traffic walkout

Dateline: DUBLIN 
Body
Air traffic controllers plan to ground flights at Ireland's three major airports for at least four hours Wednesday to 
push for pay raises and keep their free pension plans.
The Irish Aviation Authority suspended at least 15 of Ireland's 300 controllers without pay Tuesday because they 
and their union, Impact, were already refusing to operate recently upgraded air-traffic systems.
Officials at the Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports all braced for major disruptions Wednesday as controllers 
planned to walk off the job from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. (1400-1800GMT, 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. EST).
The aviation authority said about 150 flights in and out of the three airports would be canceled or suffer heavy 
delays.
Budget carrier Ryanair said it had already canceled 48 flights from Ireland, Britain, France, Germany, Italy Norway, 
the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Spain.
The airline denounced the controllers as "overpaid and underworked," and urged its estimated 6,000 
inconvenienced passengers to make complaints by telephone and e-mail to the Impact union headquarters.
Liam Kavanagh, the aviation authority's director of human resources, said a promised 6 percent pay raise for the 
controllers had been "negotiated in very different economic times in 2007" and could not be paid now that Ireland 
had fallen into recession.
Kavanagh accused the controllers of being greedy and selfish at a time of exceptional economic crisis in Ireland 
and a double-digit percent decline in passengers traveling through Irish airports.
He said controllers are "already phenomenally well-paid compared to doctors, teachers, nurses and police officers." 
It made no sense to stick to a 2007 deal when "the whole world has been turned on its head since that agreement, 
the industry is in trouble, and volumes of work are decreasing."
150 Irish flights to be hit by air-traffic walkout
But a senior union official at Impact, Michael Landers, said airport management must honor the 2 1/2-year-old pay 
deal because the Irish Aviation Authority is still recording profits. He said controllers suffer exceptional job-related 
stress and the new systems designed to boost efficiency and allow Irish airports to handle greater traffic levels 
would increase that burden.
Landers also rejected management's demand that controllers begin making contributions to their guaranteed-
benefits pension plans.
Throughout Ireland's Celtic Tiger boom of 1994-2007, wages rose steadily and strikes were kept to a minimum 
thanks to national wage deals brokered by the government.
But the 2007 agreement has unraveled amid soaring government debts, a property market collapse, 1930s-style 
deflation and a doubling of unemployment to 12.5 percent. Most Irish employers have already backed off the 2007 
deal, and unions are planning a wide range of strikes and protests.

Body
The main Dublin shares index fell modestly in line with markets around Europe and with Irish banks leading the fall.
The ISEQ fell by 6.59 points to 3,101.58.
European stocks retreated as banks slipped ahead of key earnings results, but Cadbury's acceptance of a £11.5 
billion sterling takeover offer from US giant Kraft buoyed the FTSE.
Back home, shares in AIB edged up 5c to E1.53 but Bank of Ireland fell by 4c to E1.48 after the EU Commission 
told the bank that the Irish Government should not get the E280m coupon from the preference shares it received in 
return for sinking E3.5 billion in to Bank of Ireland. It is likely, however, that the Government will be paid in ordinary 
shares, thus raising the stake the State has in the bank. The EU said that, in line with its policy and pending its 
assessment of the Bank's restructuring plan (which is required in compliance with State aid rules), that Bank of 
Ireland should not make coupon payments on its Tier 1 and Upper Tier 2 capital instruments unless under a binding 
legal obligation to do so. From the Commission's perspective, this restriction on banks which are subject to 
restructuring plans is intended to prevent the reduction of own funds by financial institutions which are still reliant on 
State aid to fulfil regulatory capital requirements. The coupon restrictions would mean that the Government would 
not be paid the E250 million dividend due to be paid on the stake it took in the bank in as part of a recapitalisation in 
May last year. Shares in Irish Life and Permanent fell by 19c to E3.75. Airline stocks, according to Davy, having 
underperformed for three years in succession, are due a period of out-performance. Valuations are still about 20pc 
off what the broker would consider mid-cycle margins (could be a 2011 event) and are potentially up to 150pc off 
peak-cycle margins. "We favour those airlines that provide catalysts and a combination of cyclicality and bottom-up 
fundamentals. Ryanair (for unit revenue, cash flow, market share gains) is our top pick among the low-cost 
carriers," said analyst, Stephen Furlong. Ryanair's shares rose by 1c to E3.40 while Aer Lingus was flat at E0.73. 
Paper packaging group, Mondi has announced a E60/tonne price increase for recycled containerboard from

February 1st. Rising input costs and stronger demand are the main reasons put forward for the increase. This is a 
significant move for the sector, Davy said, which has already implemented a E90-E100/tonne increase since August 
last. "We believe that other players, including Smurfit Kappa Group (SKG), will follow Mondi's initiative." Smurfit 
Kappa's shares rose by 4c to E6.59. Shares in DCC, which has been saved from any further action over alleged 
insider trading, saw its shares fall 12c to E20.90. Centrebet (a peer of Paddy Power's Australian business, 
Sportsbet), in a response to an enquiry by the Australian stock exchange, stated that it is unaware as to the cause 
of the recent share price hike. However, the company did reference a recent press article in which it said that 
international players (such as Ladbrokes, Paddy Power and William Hill) view the Australian market as a serious 
growth prospect. Paddy Power shares fell 50c to E24.50.

shares, thus raising the stake the State has in the bank. The EU said that, in line with its policy and pending its 
assessment of the Bank's restructuring plan (which is required in compliance with State aid rules), that Bank of 
Ireland should not make coupon payments on its Tier 1 and Upper Tier 2 capital instruments unless under a binding 
legal obligation to do so. From the Commission's perspective, this restriction on banks which are subject to 
restructuring plans is intended to prevent the reduction of own funds by financial institutions which are still reliant on 
State aid to fulfil regulatory capital requirements. The coupon restrictions would mean that the Government would 
not be paid the E250 million dividend due to be paid on the stake it took in the bank in as part of a recapitalisation in 
May last year. Shares in Irish Life and Permanent fell by 19c to E3.75. Airline stocks, according to Davy, having 
underperformed for three years in succession, are due a period of out-performance. Valuations are still about 20pc 
off what the broker would consider mid-cycle margins (could be a 2011 event) and are potentially up to 150pc off 
peak-cycle margins. "We favour those airlines that provide catalysts and a combination of cyclicality and bottom-up 
fundamentals. Ryanair (for unit revenue, cash flow, market share gains) is our top pick among the low-cost 
carriers," said analyst, Stephen Furlong. Ryanair's shares rose by 1c to E3.40 while Aer Lingus was flat at E0.73. 
Paper packaging group, Mondi has announced a E60/tonne price increase for recycled containerboard from 
ISEQ lower as DCC shares fall sharply; ISEQ Dips
February 1st. Rising input costs and stronger demand are the main reasons put forward for the increase. This is a 
significant move for the sector, Davy said, which has already implemented a E90-E100/tonne increase since August 
last. "We believe that other players, including Smurfit Kappa Group (SKG), will follow Mondi's initiative." Smurfit 
Kappa's shares rose by 4c to E6.59. Shares in DCC, which has been saved from any further action over alleged 
insider trading, saw its shares fall 12c to E20.90. Centrebet (a peer of Paddy Power's Australian business, 
Sportsbet), in a response to an enquiry by the Australian stock exchange, stated that it is unaware as to the cause 
of the recent share price hike. However, the company did reference a recent press article in which it said that 
international players (such as Ladbrokes, Paddy Power and William Hill) view the Australian market as a serious 
growth prospect. Paddy Power shares fell 50c to E24.50.

Byline: Delphine Strauss in Istanbul
Highlight: News analysis
THY has its sights on transit passengers in its bid for growth, says Delphine Strauss
Body
When Turkey's freshly elected AK party government appointed new management at Turkish Airlines (THY) in 2002, 
critics muttered that the executives had been picked as much for their affinity with religious-minded politicians as for 
their commercial credentials.
The secular press sneered when Temel Kotil, chief executive, was photographed returning from the pilgrimage to 
Mecca in his slippers, and howled when Turkish Airlines staff celebrated a delivery of aircraft by sacrificing a camel.
Yet the flag carrier, still 49 per cent state-owned, has made a flying finish to a decade of rapid expansion in which it 
has become the fourth biggest player by passenger numbers in the Association of European Airlines, increasing its 
market share from 4.19 per cent in 2005 to 7.39 per cent.
In a dismal year for the sector, passenger numbers fell 6.3 per cent across the AEA, but jumped 11 per cent year 
on year to 25.1m at THY, the company reported this week, while numbers flying business class were up 6.2 per 
cent.
Analysts at Morgan Stanley, in a recent note, predict that THY's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation margin will be "second only to Ryanair" in 2010, forecasting earnings would rise from TL657m ($452m) 
in 2008 to an estimated TL846m for 2009 despite the industry downturn.
THY's share price, which gained 4.6 per cent after the figures' release, had already trebled since mid-2009.
The company has also just placed an order with Airbus for 20 new planes from the A320 family, part of a plan to 
add 105 aircraft to the fleet by 2023.
"The work of the past five to six years has started paying back," Mr Kotil said in a recent interview, citing cost cuts 
that have brought operating costs per available seat kilometre within a whisker of Ryanair's.
Turkish flag carrier flies ahead of pack
Membership of the Lufthansa-led Star Alliance has also saved money through joint management contracts, IT 
projects and fuel purchases.
However, the drive for economies and greater outsourcing may have caused internal friction. THY's chairman quit 
unexpectedly at the end of 2009, amid speculation of boardroom disagreements.
The strategy for future growth, though, hinges on attracting more transit passengers - numbers have increased 
more than 40 per cent in the past year - and turning Istanbul into a hub for travel from Europe to the Middle East.
"If you stay in Turkey the market is saturated . . . If we focus only on international transit we'll see growth," Mr Kotil 
says.
THY's advantage, he explains, is that flying from Istanbul it can reach both European cities and the Gulf or North 
Africa in a two to five-hour flight for which its Boeing 737s and A320s are ideally suited.
Longer direct flights required bigger, less efficient planes, making it uneconomic for European airlines to fly direct 
from smaller cities to Gulf destinations, he argues.
Turkish Airlines is focusing on these routes, he said, rapidly adding flights at airports such as Bologna, or 
Gothenburg in Sweden, where half of passengers are for transit.

Highlight: Dublin Airport Authority is to offer steep discounts on passenger charges to airlines that launch new 
routes this year as it bids to reverse a 13 per cent decline in passenger traffic in 2009.
Body
News In Brief
## Dublin Airport Authority is to offer steep discounts on passenger charges to airlines that launch new routes this 
year as it bids to reverse a 13 per cent decline in passenger traffic in 2009. It is understood that 39 airlines and 
other interested parties have been invited by the DAA to a meeting at Dublin airport on Wednesday, at which airport 
director Bob Hilliard will outline its latest financial incentives. The DAA hopes to incentivise Ryanair and Aer Lingus, 
who between them control about 75 per cent of traffic at the airport, to fly into cities in Britain, Germany, France, 
Italy and Spain not currently connected to Dublin. In addition, the DAA has extended the discounts to cover five 
rather than three years. - Irish Times
## Lloyds Banking Group injected 2bn euro into its Bank of Scotland (Ireland) unit last month as it sought to buffer 
the loss-making Irish unit's balance sheet in advance of another massive bad loan impairment charge, the Irish 
Independent has learned. This brings to almost 3.5bn euro the amount the group, which is 43pc owned by the UK 
taxpayer, has pumped into BoSI over the space of 12 months to shore up its reserves. BoSI also trades under the 
Halifax brand in Ireland. The new cash call uses up a significant amount of Lloyds' record-breaking £13.5bn 'rights 
issue' share sale in December as the group sought to fireproof its capital reserves and avoid participating in the 
'asset protection scheme' -- the UK government's alternative to our 'bad-bank' plan. - Irish Independent
## e|net, the internet infrastructure company that holds the concession to manage, maintain and operate the State's 
Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) across 93 cities and towns, has welcomed the call by the National 
Competitiveness Council to have the MANs in Cork and Waterford expanded. Conal Henry, chief executive of e|net, 
said that the recommendations of the NCC represented a further endorsement of the MANs programme, in 
particular, its deployment as an open access fibre platform enabling multiple telcos to offer their products. Citing 
another reference in the NCC report, that civil works account for 80pc of the cost of rolling out fibre networks, Henry 
Roundup: DAA to slash fees on new routes Fees Slashed
said that the existence of the open access MANs which can carry traffic by multiple carriers, has done away with 
the need for a succession of expensive and disruptive road openings by different telecom companies. ## The 
president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Jack O'Connor, has said the potential still exists for a deal allowing 
for the transformation of public services and the reversal of controversial pay cuts. However, he does not believe 
the government will negotiate acceptable terms unless faced "with the inevitability of immense industrial action". 
Trade unions representing staff in the public sector have served formal notice on the Government of possible 
industrial action to come into effect within days in protest against pay cuts. Initially this will involve a work-to-rule 
and a withdrawal of co-operation with reform and modernisation plans. - Irish Times ## Irish iPhone developer, OS3 
has released News Break, an iPhone App that gathers news clips from a variety of sources. The news reader app 
which features 36 of the world's top news sources. The app costs E2.99. ## The actuarial loss for the CIE pension 
schemes in 2008 was 422m euro, according to the state company's accounts for that year. The figure represents a 
loss in value of more than 27 per cent over the value of the schemes at the year's outset. The loss brought the 
deficit in the State transport company's pension schemes to 567.6m euro. The schemes have been in deficit for the 
past number of years, usually to an amount of in the order of 250m euro. The value of the schemes' assets at the 
end of the year was 1.16bn euro, while the liabilities were valued at 1.72bn euro. - Irish Times

John Fingleton
AGE: 44
APPEARANCE: a corporate version of US actor John Turturro
NEWSWORTHINESS: the chief executive of Britain's Office of Fair Trading has hit the headlines by dubbing 
Ryanair's online booking procedures as ''childish'
Taking on Michael O'Leary is something few public figures have the appetite for, but fellow Irishman John Fingleton 
has no problems taking a few swipes at the Ryanair boss.
Last week, Fingleton, the head of the Office of Fair Trading in Britain, described Ryanair's online booking system as 
''puerile'' and ''childish'', comments which made headlines across Britain and further afield.
O'Leary was quick to dismiss the remarks, and even offered special 'Fingleton fares' in Ryanair's typical guerrilla 
marketing style. But Fingleton tends not to be rattled by O'Leary, or anyone else in big business.
There is little doubt that the regulator knew what he was getting himself into by attacking Ryanair and was showing 
that he has no fear of any adversary, even one as feisty as O'Leary. The former Competition Authority chief 
executive recently signed up for another five years at the OFT helm, and will have several large targets in his 
sights.
Colleagues and business acquaintances describe him as sharp-minded and charismatic, and have little doubt in his 
ability to keep competition issues in the news. Some believe he is a publicity-seeker, although he has had a lower 
profile at the OFT than he did as head of the Irish authority.
Honest John
Fingleton started his working life as an economist, and could have pursued his interest in competition from behind a 
university desk, but a sharp mind and appetite for hard work quickly marked him out as someone with a different 
path ahead of him.
Now 44, he began his journey at Trinity College, Dublin and went on to finish his PhD at Oxford in record time. The 
Portlaoise native became a lecturer in economics in TCD, and later became a visiting scholar at the University of 
Chicago.
The world of competition law took notice when he published a book on taxi regulation in the 1990s.How to deal with 
taxi licensing is a conundrum faced by most western economies, and his solution - which was not adopted in Ireland 
- was seen as an impressive piece of work.
By 2000, there were few people closely following modern economics in Ireland or Britain who weren't aware of 
Fingleton.
Following an open competition, he was appointed as chief executive of the Competition Authority.
Most people agree that Fingleton reinvigorated the Authority. Board member and director of advocacy Declan 
Purcell recalled that on his very first day, ''He said:
'You've never met anyone with as much energy as I have', and it is 100 per cent true."
Purcell said Fingleton was passionate about everything he did, and added that ''he has great leadership qualities, 
and is extremely bright and intelligent''.
Another former colleague recalled that the Authority was an exciting and dynamic place to work under Fingleton. 
''He is very hands-on, a workaholic. He also brought in very good people to work around him. He brought in lawyers 
from the States and was seen internationally as very cutting-edge.
He managed to convince people to come to the Authority for much less money, and brought in people from Africa, 
Europe, New Zealand and America," said the ex colleague.
Fingleton seems to have attracted people through his natural charisma, and is described as academically skilled but 
''very good at adopting practical knowledge to actual scenarios''. But this is not a view shared by everyone, and one 
source said that senior civil servants and business representatives felt he was too academic in his approach.
One long-time staffer at the Authority said: ''I think he transformed this place.
He was full of ideas. Before he came here, he wouldn't have had much opportunity to lead people, even in a small 
organisation, but he is a very fast learner."
Many people who know Fingleton say he is a good communicator, and he continues to be a regular and impressive 
speech-giver. One close observer who has followed Fingleton's progress since before he was in the Authority 
agreed that Fingleton was bright, but said that he was a propagator of ideas rather than an originator of ideas.
He also has a tendency to look at the big picture and, while his supporters see this as fresh thinking, his critics see 
this as 'woolly' and academic, said the source.
Ken Murphy, director general of the Law Society, whose background is in competition law, noted that Fingleton 
takes a purist approach to competition, a position not shared by all economists.
Fingleton won few friends among the legal profession because it was one of the areas he targeted during his tenure 
in the Authority. Murphy, who also described Fingleton as bright and energetic, said:
''I've known him for many years, and he tended to be very purist and maybe slightly academic in his view of the 
absolute value of competition as the answer to all ills."
Honest John
There were a number of significant developments at the Authority during Fingleton's time. The body expanded 
significantly from around 20 people to 50.
The Competition Act 2002 was implemented with considerable input from Fingleton and his team. The body also 
took over the Mergers and Acquisition responsibility from the Department of Enterprise, Trade & Employment.
Andrew Whittaker, editor of Irish journal Competition, said he would be reluctant to credit Fingleton with reviving the 
Authority, and said he was the beneficiary of changing legislation.
Whittaker said criticism could be levelled at Fingleton for his decision to tackle the professions. While some see this 
as one of his achievements in office, Whittaker believes it was too ambitious. ''Not that they didn't merit study. . . it 
was overly ambitious in the amount of work it involved with the rather small staff they had to do it." The studies into 
the professions are still continuing.
Those who worked with Fingleton have generally good things to say about him. He is described as very sociable, 
and not slow to throw a dinner party. But he is seen as a serious individual, despite his popularity.
He is not married, and has no children. In terms of appearance, it is often noted that he has different-coloured eyes: 
one blue and one brown.
Following the Ryanair comments, O'Leary pointed out that Fingleton earns stg£270,000 a year and does not need 
to avail of Ryanair's low fares. But Fingleton has said in the past that he is not motivated by money but, rather, by 
interesting and challenging things.
There was some surprise and disappointment when the OFT came looking for Fingleton in 2005,and he was viewed 
as a catch for the organisation. At Oxford, he had studied under Sir John Vickers, the OFT chairman for a number 
of years.
But the size and scale of the OFT were impossible to resist. If Fingleton had been an Irish watchdog criticising 
Ryanair, it would have been covered in the Irish press. As OFT boss, his remarks have received international 
attention.
At the OFT, he has a budget of stg£70 million and over 700 staff. It has the ability to make companies pay tens, 
even hundreds, of millions of pounds in fines. Since he has taken over at the OFT, Fingleton believes one of his 
biggest achievement is a prioritisation programme. He feels that fewer high-profile cases should be pursued. 
Perhaps this is something he learned from his time in the Authority.
The regulator has been described as much more brutal under Fingleton, in that it has made tough decisions in 
choosing which cases to follow and which to drop, given its limited resources.
Among the criticisms of Fingleton is that he is a self-promoter. Fingleton has said that he has no interest in his 
personal profile, and would argue that he promotes competition issues rather than himself.
But he faced criticism for the manner in which the OFT released provisional findings in its inquiry into alleged 
supermarket price fixing. The OFT had to pay stg£100,000 to chain Wm Morrison and issue an apology (for not 
using the word 'alleged').
The High Court judge at the time said that the OFT had engaged in 'sensationalist publicity'.
But his profile has dipped here since he went to the OFT. Sources said that this was due to the structure at the 
body, as there is an executive chairman who is more often called upon to speak on weighty competition measures. 
Others feel he may have opted for a lower profile, deciding to change tack after the Authority experiences.
But perhaps the colourful criticisms of Ryanair will mark amore public approach for Fingleton's second term at the 
OFT.
Honest John
Certainly, there are no sacred cows for him, and he has been willing to overturn previous OFT decisions, adding to 
his powerful reputation. He is regularly listed among Britain's business movers and shakers.
Competition editor Whittaker said Fingleton had made a big impact in his current job, despite his lower profile. ''I 
think he's done well. The OFT has significant successes in challenging illegitimate mergers and significant 
successes in anti-cartel work."
British government insiders have also noted his sharp mind, one source said.
The list of those he has successfully targeted so far includes big businesses and household names. Supermarket 
chain Asda and the tobacco giant Gallaher were among companies fined stg£173 million for fixing cigarette prices. 
Asda was fined again with Sainsbury's and dairies to the tune of stg£116 million for colluding on milk prices. 
Several builders were hit with a stg£129 million fine for collusion. British Airways was fined stg£121 million for a fuel 
cartel with Virgin. (Ironically, O'Leary was cheering Fingleton on in 2007 when he was tackling British Airways for 
alleged price-fixing on fuel surcharges.)
But Fingleton took a major hit last December when the OFT's highest-profile case (a challenge to stg£2.6 billion-a-
year overdraft charges by banks) hit a brick wall when a test case failed in court. OFT lawyers decided another 
legal challenge could take several years to prosecute and would probably fail, potentially costing millions of pounds.
One competition source pointed out that several findings and fines imposed under Fingleton, both in Ireland and 
Britain, have subsequently been overturned. The builders are about to challenge their OFT fine through the courts.
Despite his criticism of Ryanair, there is no investigation into the airline, although it is among the airlines who were 
forced to change how they advertise prices in 2007.
The OFT did begin a probe last October into price advertising, focusing on online retail. Areas it will examine 
include price comparison sites. It previously said the credit and debit card charges of travel firms were likely to be 
covered by the investigation.
Businesses found wanting can be assured that Fingleton will continue to focus his considerable energies on 
levelling out the playing field for consumers.

The big freeze will give some Irish-listed companies a much needed boost, according to analysts. Among these is 
Origin Enterprises, which should benefit from a bigger demand for animal feed.
There have already been fodder shortages due to the bad summer and now animals are being housed indoors, 
resulting in greater dependency on feed.
Origin is the leading supplier of macro raw material ingredients to the Irish animal feed industry.
Ross McEvoy, an analyst at Merrion, said: ''The prolonged cold spell and poor summer crop could lead to a rise in 
demand for animal feeds, benefiting Origin, for whom animal feed represents about 23 per cent of total profits."
Another company set to benefit from the sub-zero temperatures is DCC.
Energy represents 57 per cent of the group's operating profits.
Colder conditions last year added  10 million extra to divisional earnings. However, a number of listed companies 
are likely to see results suffer because of the bad conditions.
Horse Racing Ireland has had to cancel a number of meetings, which is bad news for bookmaker Paddy Power. 
Insurance company FBD will see an increase in claims due to weather-related accidents; this will compound recent 
payouts for flood damage claims.
The travel business has also been hit by the freezing temperatures and snow, with January numbers for Ryanair 
and Aer Lingus likely to be adversely affected.

Chocolate stirred
Billionaire investor Warren Buffett waded into the takeover battle for Cadbury by warning US suitor Kraft it should 
not use too much of its stock to finance the £10.4bn hostile deal.
The intervention by the "Sage of Omaha" came as Kraft raised $3.7bn (£2.3bn) from the sale of its North American 
pizza business to Nestlé and said it would increase the proportion of cash in its existing offer for Cadbury. Mr 
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway investment group is Kraft's largest shareholder with a 9.4 per cent stake. His rebuke 
to Kraft came as rival confectioner Nestlé signalled it had no interest in bidding.
Mr Buffett's refusal to back a "blank cheque" for Kraft in raising its offer for Cadbury has reduced the chances of a 
deal, though some suggested one might yet proceed - but without any significant advance on the current offer.
Trolley battles
The propaganda war between the UK's leading supermarket chains flared up again as Tesco and Asda crossed 
swords on who sells the most products cheapest.
Asda said it was making its biggest price "rollback" for a decade, promising cuts on a broad range of products, after 
Tesco pledged to cut prices through offers on 12,000 grocery lines.
At least Justin King, chief executive at J Sainsbury, kept some perspective on the spectre of a discounting 
bloodbath. He played down the trading impact of annual January price cutting campaigns, and queried suggestions 
of any looming "mother of all price wars".
Fiver flights
The £5 fee imposed by Ryanair on many internet bookings sparked a dispute with Britain's consumer protection 
chief, in a sign of wider concern about the extra charges levied by companies by means of "drip pricing".
The big stories
The low-cost airline delivered a cheeky riposte to criticisms of the charge by John Fingleton, Office of Fair Trading 
chief executive, by offering customers 1m £4 "Fingleton fares" for midweek travel.
The spat - triggered by Mr Fingleton's attack on the Ryanair booking fee as "puerile" - comes as the OFT 
investigates whether companies are unfairly adding costs during the booking process to services they offer, 
particularly online.
3D move
The prospect of television viewers experiencing head-to-head clashes with footballers from the comfort of their 
armchairs moved a step closer after ESPN said it would launch the first three-dimension channel this summer.
The Disney-owned sports network, which along with BSkyB holds the rights to live Premier League football in 
England, plans to kick off its 3D service with coverage of the World Cup in South Africa.
But UK viewers wishing to witness the inevitable demise of England in a 3D broadcast of a penalty shoot-out may 
have to wait until the next tournament. The 3D service will initially be limited to the US.

Third Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus 'unlikely'
Third Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus 'unlikely'

Low-cost airline builds its cash pile
Capital expenditure to be slashed
Body
Ryanair says it is "highly unlikely" to make another bid for Ireland's struggling flag carrier, Aer Lingus, as Europe's 
largest no-frills airline confirmed yesterday it was on track to substantially boost its EUR2.5bn ($3.6bn) cash pile 
over the next three years.
"There is no truth or basis to recent . . . speculation that Ryanair is preparing a third bid for Aer Lingus," the airline 
said in a statement after briefing investors on its strategy. "In the absence of any decision by the Irish [government] 
to sell its 25 per cent stake, a third bid by Ryanair remains highly unlikely."
Ryanair, the biggest investor in Aer Lingus with a stake of 29.8 per cent, has made two failed bids for Aer Lingus 
since late 2006. The first was blocked by European regulators on competition grounds and the second, in 
December 2008, failed after the Irish government said it undervalued the airline.
Speculation has grown about a third bid because Ireland's takeover rules permit such a move from the end of 
January, and Ryanair looks set to bolster its balance sheet.
Ryanair executives confirmed to investors that after last year's failed talks with Boeing on buying up to 200 new 
jets, the airline would slash its annual capital expenditure from its current EUR1.2bn to EUR100m by the financial 
year ending March 2013.
As a result, Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said: "We expect our current cash reserves of EUR2.5bn to grow 
substantially by March 2013 and we plan to distribute surplus cash to shareholders from that date." Shares in both 
companies dipped more than 1.5 per cent in late afternoon trading yesterday.
Separately, Ryanair lifted a threat to cancel its Italian domestic operations from later this month after resolving a 
dispute with Italy's civil aviation authority over passenger security arrangements.
Third Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus 'unlikely'
The airline had threatened to cancel all its flights in the domestic Italian market from January 23 after the regulator, 
Enac, said it would allow passengers on domestic flights to use documents other than passports or official ID cards 
when checking in and boarding.
Ryanair, which accepts only passports or European Union ID cards, said the new policy could undermine safety.
The two sides met in Rome on Thursday, after which Ryanair said the dispute had been resolved and there was no 
longer any threat to its domestic Italian services.
Meanwhile, Ryanair said it carried 4.9m passengers in December, up 12 per cent on the same month in 2008, 
meaning annual traffic grew 13 per cent to 65.3m in the 2009 calendar year.

Ryanair to keep flying domestically in Italy

Ryanair backed down Thursday from a threat to ground its domestic flights in Italy after aviation officials agreed to 
limit the types of ID documents passengers can show at airport gates.
Under a deal with Italy's civil aviation authority, known by the acronym ENAC, passengers flying Ryanair will still be 
required to show a passport or a national identity card when boarding domestic flights, the carrier said in a 
statement.
Last month, the Irish budget airline threatened to stop operating domestic flights out of 10 Italian airports starting 
Jan. 23 after ENAC pressed it to comply with new rules allowing passengers to show other ID documents, including 
driver's licenses, government badges, and even fishing and hunting licenses.
The airline had said those identification methods were less secure and the decision threatened flight safety. ENAC 
had insisted the rules were based on Italian law and all other carriers had agreed to comply with them.
ENAC confirmed a deal had been reached at a meeting with Ryanair officials on Thursday, saying the two sides 
had agreed licenses to drive, hunt and fish would not, at least for now, be accepted as forms of identification.
The authority gave Ryanair more time to study the feasibility of accepting most of the documents listed in the new 
rules, especially driver's licenses, ENAC president Vito Riggio said at a news conference. Ryanair would accept 
documents issued by state authorities, such as government badges, he said.
Ryanair spokesman Stephen McNamara said this would be the only new form of identification accepted by the 
airline.
Ryanair said in its statement it would contact passengers to advise them that domestic flights would continue 
uninterrupted after Jan. 23.

The main Dublin shares index failed to lift itself out of negative territory yesterday as investors again sold off CRH 
stocks and amid a sharp drop in Ryanair shares.
In the last two trading days, Ireland's bond spreads have widened a touch again. That may reflect delayed 
acknowledgement of Finance Minister Lenihan's illness. But in the four weeks since the Budget up until Monday, 
Ireland had tightened by 50 basis points versus German bunds (based on the 10-year bond). In the same period for 
example, Greece's CDS had shot higher, suggesting that Ireland is finally getting credit for having stabilised its 
budget deficit, according to Davy Research.
Shares in Ryanair fell by 5c to E3.48 after it said it was 'highly unlikely' it would make another attempt to buy the 
airline as long as the Government held on to its 25 per cent stake. "There is no truth or basis to recent Irish media 
speculation that Ryanair is preparing a third bid for Aer Lingus," it said in a statement. Ryanair said today it 
increased its pessenger traffic 13 per cent to 65.3 million passengers in 2009. "With the unsuccessful termination of 
our talks with Boeing for a 200 aircraft order in December, planned capital expenditure will now decline from E1.2

The main Dublin shares index failed to lift itself out of negative territory yesterday as investors again sold off CRH 
stocks and amid a sharp drop in Ryanair shares.
In the last two trading days, Ireland's bond spreads have widened a touch again. That may reflect delayed 
acknowledgement of Finance Minister Lenihan's illness. But in the four weeks since the Budget up until Monday, 
Ireland had tightened by 50 basis points versus German bunds (based on the 10-year bond). In the same period for 
example, Greece's CDS had shot higher, suggesting that Ireland is finally getting credit for having stabilised its 
budget deficit, according to Davy Research.
Shares in Ryanair fell by 5c to E3.48 after it said it was 'highly unlikely' it would make another attempt to buy the 
airline as long as the Government held on to its 25 per cent stake. "There is no truth or basis to recent Irish media 
speculation that Ryanair is preparing a third bid for Aer Lingus," it said in a statement. Ryanair said today it 
increased its pessenger traffic 13 per cent to 65.3 million passengers in 2009. "With the unsuccessful termination of 
our talks with Boeing for a 200 aircraft order in December, planned capital expenditure will now decline from E1.2 
billion in the current year to as little as E100 million p.a. in fiscal year ending March 2013," said chief executive

Budget airline Ryanair plans to return cash to shareholders from 2013 as it cuts capital expenditure by more than 
90 percent after pulling out of talks to buy 200 aircraft from Boeing.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline and close to being the biggest carrier overall, denied reports it was 
preparing a third bid for Irish rival Aer Lingus.
"In the absence of any decision by the Irish government to sell its 25 percent stake, a third bid by Ryanair remains 
highly unlikely," Ryanair said in a statement this morning ahead of an investor briefing.
Ryanair's passenger traffic in December grew 12 percent to 4.9 million, bringing the number for the whole calendar 
year to 65.3 million, which it plans to raise to more than 66 million in the business year to the end of March. "We 
expect our current cash reserves of 2.5 billion euros to grow substantially by March 2013 and we plan to distribute 
surplus cash to shareholders from that date," it said. The statement also said Ryanair traffic grew in December by 
12pc to 4.9m pax, and load factor rose 2pc to 82pc. Annual traffic grew 13pc to 65.3m for calendar year 2009. Over 
50pc of its fuel needs for the year to March 2011 are now hedged at approximately USD 720 a tonne.

BA sees fresh fall in traffic numbers
BA sees fresh fall in traffic numbers

British Airways reported another poor set of monthly passenger numbers yesterday, as airlines began releasing 
their first traffic figures since BA cabin crew threatened a 12-day strike during the Christmas and new year holiday 
season.
But analysts said the figures for December were not as bad as might have been expected, given the extensive 
media coverage of the industrial dispute.
The number of BA passengers worldwide fell to 2.4m in December, a slide of 4.4 per cent compared with the same 
month in 2008, with the UK and Europe recording a slightly higher fall of 4.7 per cent.
This was almost as bad as the year-on-year decreases BA reported this time last year, as the airline industry was 
still struggling with the September 2008 collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank and the global financial 
crisis.
But at that time, business class and first class traffic slumped by just over 12 per cent, while yesterday's figures 
showed such premium traffic fell by only 0.7 per cent, with economy passenger numbers down 4.6 per cent.
The cabin crew strike threat, which was eventually averted after BA won a court order on December 17 declaring 
the union ballot behind it invalid, may have contributed to some of the fall in passenger numbers.
Cancellations led to fuller aircraft, meaning the load factor, or share of seats filled, rose slightly, though only by 0.1 
per cent.
BA's low-cost rival, EasyJet, reported stronger figures yesterday, with passenger numbers rising to 3.4m for the 
month, a 9.3 per cent increase over December 2008.
EasyJet, Europe's second biggest low-cost airline after Ryanair, saw its load factor jump to more than 85 per cent in 
December, a strong figure for the month.
BA sees fresh fall in traffic numbers
"BA helped at the margins," said an EasyJet spokesman. "There was a little bit of a positive effect, but not much. It 
was definitely much more to do with weather."
But analysts said the impact on revenues could be notable for EasyJet. "Whilst we imagine the BA dispute boosted 
the load factor by 1 point or so, the revenue impact will be more significant as those passengers garnered at the 
last minute will have been on abnormally high fares," said Andrew Lobbenberg of RBS.

Ryanair had threatened to stop domestic flights at 10 Italian airports from January 23, saying civil aviation authority 
ENAC had lowered standards on identification documents and approved fishing permits and company badges as 
valid IDs.
Under the deal, passengers will have to produce either a passport or a European Union/European Economic Area

ENAC, which had threatened to sue the airline for libel over its statements on security standards at Italian airports,

Irish shares are mixed this morning, with the ISEQ index edging up by just a minimal 1.78 points to 3,089.71 a short 
time ago.
Trading lacked any pattern, with rises and falls across the board.
Ryanair was unchanged on 353 after it said it was still very unlikely to bad again for Aer Lingus.
Shares in the latter carrier fell by 1c to 64. Banks were mixed, with Irish Life and Permanent up 4c to 355, with 
AIBdown 1c to 160 and Bank of Ireland off by 2c to 167. DCC was down 36c to 2020 and Smurfit Kappa fell by 8c

Ryanair snaps back at OFT watchdog over 'drip pricing'
Ryanair snaps back at OFT watchdog over 'drip pricing'

Body
A £5 fee imposed by Ryanair on many internet flight bookings has sparked a dispute with Britain's consumer 
protection chief, in a sign of wider concern about the extra charges levied by companies by means of "drip pricing".
The low-cost airline delivered a typically quixotic riposte to criticisms of the charge by John Fingleton, Office of Fair 
Trading chief executive, offering customers 1m £4 "Fingleton Fares" for midweek travel.
The spat - triggered by Mr Fingleton's attack on the Ryanair booking fee as "puerile" - comes as the OFT 
investigates whether companies are unfairly adding costs during the booking process to services they offer, 
particularly online.
Ryanair announced the ticket offer - which comes with several restrictions - after Mr Fingleton was quoted in The 
Independent newspaper criticising the company for charging £5 for bookings made with cards other than the 
MasterCard pre-paid service. The airline described Mr Fingleton's remarks - he accused it of playing "silly games" - 
as "disappointing and wrong".
The company - a longstanding antagonist of the OFT - said: "Ryanair fails to understand why it was singled out for 
these inaccurate criticisms by Mr Fingleton, when its charges policies are copied by high fare UK airlines."
"Fingleton fare" tickets not bought through MasterCard pre-pay will be subject to the booking fee, increasing their 
cost by 125 per cent - and inadvertently offering support to the OFT's argument that "drip pricing" can lead to large 
differences between advertised product costs and the amount consumers pay.
The OFT defended Mr Fingleton's remarks about Ryanair but said it could add nothing to his statement that the 
agency "might or might not" take action against the airline.
The OFT said no investigation was under way into the company, which in 2007 was one of 13 airlines ordered by 
the agency to change websites to stop advertising flights for pennies when the true cost was many pounds.
Ryanair snaps back at OFT watchdog over 'drip pricing'
The agency began a probe in October into price advertising, focusing on online retail. Areas it will examine include 
price-comparison sites, "baiting sales" - where only some products are available at discount - and time-limited 
offers.
The OFT has previously said travel companies' credit and debit card charges are likely to be covered by the 
investigation.

Yesterday's attack on Ryanair by the Office of Fair Trading was 'disappointing and wrong', the budget airline has 
insisted.
Defending its controversial charging practices, Ryanair said there were no hidden fees or charges on its website 
and that all non-discretionary charges were included in the airline's advertised prices.
The Dublin-based airline is particularly angry at the OFT's attack on its payment handing fees, which are levied on 
all flights except those booked with a pre-paid Mastercard.
Such charges were 'puerile' and 'almost childish', OFT chief executive John Fingleton said in a widely-publicised 
interview with the Independent newspaper yesterday.
'Ryanair fails to understand why it was singled out for these inaccurate criticisms by Mr Fingleton, when its charges 
policies are copied by high fare UK airlines,' the airline said in a statement.
'Perhaps Mr Fingleton's comments are designed to cover over the OFT's failure to take any action against BA's 
unfair fuel surcharges, the BAA's monopoly pricing or the continuing mis-selling by screenscraper websites across 
the UK and Europe, who routinely add hidden mark-ups to Ryanair's low fares.'
Ryanair later moved to escalate the row with the OFT even further by offering one million special £4 'Fingleton 
Fares' for midweek travel.

The Office of Fair Trading boss John Fingleton might be preparing for a tussle with Ryanair's Michael O'Leary 
over credit card fees the airline charges customers, but for the past several years the two Irishmen, along with 
fellow countryman Willie Walsh of BA, have been reading from the same page on airports.
Back in 2007, amid calls by airlines including BA and Ryanair for BAA to be broken up, the OFT referred the airport 
group to the Competition Commission. Prior to his appointment at the OFT, Mr Fingleton, who was head of the 
competition authority in Ireland, ordered the deregulation and reorganisation of Ireland's airports, a move supported 
by Mr Walsh, then boss of Aer Lingus, as well as Mr O'Leary.

Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday defended its charging policy for online bookings against claims of 
"quite peurile" behavior from the head of Britain's business watchdog.
Office of Fair Trading Chief Executive John Fingleton singled out Ryanair for adding charges to payments made 
online with a popular type of bank card.
Ryanair last month began charging customers a 5 pound ($8) fee per passenger for each ticket bought using a 
commonly used Electron card, which had previously been free. It instead switched the charge-free option to the 
more infrequently used MasterCard prepay.
"Ryanair has this funny game where they have found some very low frequency payment mechanism and say: 'Well 
because you can pay with that, then the charge is called optional'," Fingleton was quoted as saying in The 
Independent newspaper.
"It's almost like taunting consumers and pointing out: 'Oh well, we know this is completely outside the spirit of the 
law, but we think it's within the narrow letter of the law'," Fingleton added. "On some level it's quite puerile, it's 
almost childish."
Ryanair maintained that there are no hidden charges on its Web site and that all nondiscretionary fees are included 
in all its advertised prices.
"Ryanair fails to understand why it was singled out for these inaccurate criticisms by Mr. Fingleton, when its 
charges policies are copied by high fare U.K. airlines," the company said in an e-mailed statement.

Irish no-frills airline Ryanair has been slammed by a British business watchdog for being "puerile" and "childish" 
over parts of its charging policy.
The UK's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) chief executive John Fingleton attacked the Irish company for fees that it 
adds on when customers pay by card online.
In an interview in The Independent newspaper, he also questions the automatic addition of insurance to flights, 
unless customers opt out, calling it a legal "grey area".
The paper says Ryanair advertises taxes and other fees upfront but only mentions charges for paying by plastic at 
the end of booking, on the grounds that customers could escape the fee by using an obscure prepaid card. 
"Ryanair has this funny game where they have found some very low frequency payment mechanism and say: 'Well 
because you can pay with that (the charge is optional)'," he said. "It's almost like taunting consumers. On some 
level it's quite puerile, it's almost childish." Earlier this year, following OFT intervention, Ryanair promised to take 
steps to increase the clarity and transparency of its website and other advertising. Ryanair Head of 
Communications Stephen McNamara said: "Ryanair is not for the overpaid John Fingletons of this world but for the 
everyday Joe Bloggs who opt for Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares because we give them the opportunity to fly 
across 26 European countries for free, £5 and £10. What the OFT must realise is that passengers prefer Ryanair's 
model, as it allows them to avoid costs, such as baggage charges, which are still included in the high fares of high-
cost, fuel-surcharging, strike-threatened airlines such as BA."

Budget airline Ryanair has been accused of 'almost taunting' passengers with the charges it imposes for using 
cards when booking flights.
In an interview with the Independent newspaper, John Fingleton, the chief executive of the Office of Fair Trading, 
described the airline's tactics as 'puerile' and 'almost childish'. Customers booking flights with Ryanair only find out 
that they will be charged for using a card at the end of the booking process.
Fingleton said Ryanair had chosen a rare payment method - MasterCard pre-pay - to get around the rules which 
state that if an airline offers at least one free payment method, it is allowed to advertise cheap fares that do not 
include extra credit card charges.
He told the Independent: 'It's almost like taunting consumers and pointing out: 'Oh well, we know this is completely 
outside the spirit of the law, but we think it's within the narrow letter of the law'.

UCD economist Colm McCarthy has called for it to be scrapped, and Ryanair's Michael O 'Leary has dubbed it a 
white elephant and recommended that it be mothballed.
But the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) has resisted all opposition to the second terminal at Dublin Airport, and 
passengers will get their first glimpse of it in November, when it opens for business.
Plans for a second terminal at the country's main airport were first mooted in 2005 in response to soaring 
passenger numbers.
According to the DAA, the airport experienced double-digit traffic growth every year between 1998 and 2007, 
making it one of the fastestgrowing airports in Europe during that period.
However there has been a massive fall-off in passenger numbers at the airport in recent times, and the DAA is 
facing a  70 million earnings shortfall as a result. The authority estimates that passenger numbers fell by 13 per 
cent last year.
This has prompted the DAA to seek to reduce its payroll costs by  38 million through redundancies and pay cuts.
Significant cutbacks, including the loss of 450 jobs, have been agreed by unions.
The DAA has also increased passenger charges by 26 per cent.
Construction of the second terminal began in October 2007. The DAA said the new terminal would cost  609 million 
to build. That includes a linked new boarding gate facility known as Pier E, a new energy centre, new aircraft 
parking stands and a major upgrade of the airport's internal road network.
T2 cleared for November takeoff
The curved glass exterior of the terminal building is now a familiar sight on the airport skyline. Terminal Two is the 
centrepiece of the DAA's Transforming programme, a  2 billion investment designed to improve, expand and 
modernise Dublin airport.
It is the largest construction project in the country, with up to 2,200 workers employed on site. The DAA estimates 
that for every T2 job directly created at the airport, at least three others are supported throughout Ireland in the 
manufacturing, service and transport sectors.
The airport authority has awarded 17 contracts relating to the building of the second terminal, although the value of 
each contract has not been disclosed.
A consortium comprising Ove Arup, Pascall & Watson and Mace - international design, architecture and project 
management consultancies respectively - was appointed as project managers and designers for Terminal 2, Pier E 
and all the associated kerbside integration works needed to link the new passenger terminal with the existing 
Terminal 1.
Construction is now more than 85 per cent complete and the focus has shifted inside, as the internal fit-out, which is 
being carried out by Irish firm PJ Hegarty, proceeds. This contract includes the floors, walls, ceilings and all other 
fittings for the 75,000 square metre terminal and the 24,000 square metre Pier E boarding gate.
The terminal will be costly to run - according to a newspaper report, a report by the Booz Company forecast it would 
cost  42million to run T2 in 2011, its first full year of operation.
The report said this would rise to  46 million by 2014.
Paul O'Kane, director of public affairs at the DAA, said T2 was designed to transform the passenger experience at 
Dublin Airport for decades to come. It will be capable of handling up to 15million passengers a year.
T2 is being funded by the DAA through commercial income, borrowings and airport charges.
The terminal is one of three major projects that will come on stream this year. The new Lansdowne Road opens in 
August, while the Dublin Convention Centre opens in September.

Highlight: The Irish-based airline will continue to grow says Howard Millar speaking in Dublin today.
Body
Ryanair is expects to report losses in the second half of the year, but Howard Millar, CFO, Ryanair, says that 
opportunities exist despite difficult market conditions. 
Speaking at the European Airfinance conference today, Millar says: "There is tremendous opportunity during this 
recession. We took a lot of market share after 9/11."
He described how the airline is expecting to grow by 50% over the next three years, with 73 million passengers by 
2011. In 2002, the airline carried two million passengers.
While all of Ryanair's competitors were hedging fuel two years ago, Ryanair chose to take a risk by not hedging. Of 
their strategy, Millar says: "Some call it lucky, we like to call it canny management strategy."
Millar was not shy about discussing negotiations with Boeing for a large aircraft order that broke down last 
December. Of the negotiations for 200 737-800s that fell through in December Millar says: "Why are we not do a 
deal with Boeing? I'm still a bit puzzled by the whole thing." 
"It was like first world war type negotiations. They were in a deep trench, we were in a deep trench and we met in 
no man's land."& Ryanair and Boeing simply could not agree a price. Millar says that the airline has no plans to 
reopen the negotiations with Boeing, unless a much better price is achieved. 
Ryanair already has a fleet of 210 737-800s that have an average age of 2.7 years. 
At the end of 2012 (fiscal year 2013) Ryanair will owe its shareholders a significant payment, but it has not been 
worked out how it will be structured. "There will be some element of growth after 2013," says Millar. "Perhaps we'll 
be a different size and shape airline at that point." 
Though Millar says that the company will grow about 50% over the next three years, the airline might have to look 
different to achieve that with no aircraft on order past 2013 to expand operations.

News In Brief
## Italy's civil aviation regulator says it may sue Ryanair Holdings for libel in a row over security check-in 
documents. The low-cost carrier said last week it would stop domestic flights at 10 Italian airports from January 23 
because of reduced security in check-in measures. Ryanair objects to a decision by ENAC, the civil aviation body, 
to lower requirements on documents presented by passengers. ENAC chairman Vito Riggio said that he was 
studying possible cases of libel against Ryanair. He said security standards at Italian airports were certified by 
international bodies. "Their statement is defamatory and damages the image of our country and affects the 
government as a whole," Mr Riggio said. - Irish Independent
## House prices in Northern Ireland fell by 6.7pc in 2009, the biggest regional drop in the UK, it has been revealed. 
According to Nationwide Building Society, the average home value in the area is now £137,949, compared to a UK 
average of £162,103 - up 5.9pc this year. Nationwide's figures show that London saw the strongest growth in 2009, 
with the average home in the capital now costing £276,088 - 7pc more than it did a year ago. - Belfast Telegraph
## Staff at NAMA will be exempt from the public service pay cut, the Department of Finance has confirmed. The 
agency, which will relieve the banks of their higher-risk loans, is being established under the aegis of the National 
Treasury Management Agency, the body which manages the national debt. The NTMA has traditionally set its own 
pay rates for staff in order to compete with the private sector for high-calibre employees. The department says this 
will continue to be the case, and that the NTMA - and hence NAMA - will escape the public sector pay cut, which 
takes effect from January 1. - Irish Examiner ## Irish mortgage lenders' reliance on short-term funding from the 
European Central Bank dropped 18pc to 34bn euro in November as wholesale funding markets continued to thaw

that the ECB kept the Irish banking system afloat earlier this year as global markets turned against the property-

the US subprime crisis erupted in August 2007. But the figure had shot up to 39bn euro a month after Lehmans

News In Brief
## Italy's civil aviation regulator says it may sue Ryanair Holdings for libel in a row over security check-in 
documents. The low-cost carrier said last week it would stop domestic flights at 10 Italian airports from January 23 
because of reduced security in check-in measures. Ryanair objects to a decision by ENAC, the civil aviation body, 
to lower requirements on documents presented by passengers. ENAC chairman Vito Riggio said that he was 
studying possible cases of libel against Ryanair. He said security standards at Italian airports were certified by 
international bodies. "Their statement is defamatory and damages the image of our country and affects the 
government as a whole," Mr Riggio said. - Irish Independent
## House prices in Northern Ireland fell by 6.7pc in 2009, the biggest regional drop in the UK, it has been revealed. 
According to Nationwide Building Society, the average home value in the area is now £137,949, compared to a UK 
average of £162,103 - up 5.9pc this year. Nationwide's figures show that London saw the strongest growth in 2009, 
with the average home in the capital now costing £276,088 - 7pc more than it did a year ago. - Belfast Telegraph
## Staff at NAMA will be exempt from the public service pay cut, the Department of Finance has confirmed. The 
agency, which will relieve the banks of their higher-risk loans, is being established under the aegis of the National 
Treasury Management Agency, the body which manages the national debt. The NTMA has traditionally set its own 
pay rates for staff in order to compete with the private sector for high-calibre employees. The department says this 
will continue to be the case, and that the NTMA - and hence NAMA - will escape the public sector pay cut, which 
takes effect from January 1. - Irish Examiner ## Irish mortgage lenders' reliance on short-term funding from the 
European Central Bank dropped 18pc to 34bn euro in November as wholesale funding markets continued to thaw

European equities broke their Christmas rally yesterday as investors booked profits following six consecutive 
sessions of gains.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 edged 0.4 per cent lower to 1,043.24. After touching an all-time low in early March, the 
index is on track to record a gain of about 25 per cent this year, its best annual performance since 1999.
One of the stand-out performers in yesterday's session was Turkish conglomerate Dogan Holding , which jumped 
9.6 per cent to TL1.03.
The group said founder Aydin Dogan will leave his post as management board chairman next month and be 
replaced by Arzuhan Dogan Yalcindag, his daughter.
Russia's Lukoil and Norway's Statoil both declined 1.2 per cent to Rbs1,688.06 and 1.2 per cent to NKr144.8, 
respectively, in spite of news that they had formally signed a contract with Iraqi authorities to develop Iraq's vast 
West Qurna 2 oil fields.
Financials, one of the best performing sectors this year, yesterday weighed down the indices the most.
In Dublin, Allied Irish Banks lost 5.9 per cent to EUR1.21 and Bank of Ireland  dipped 2.3 per cent to EUR1.36. 
UBS was down 1.7 per cent to SFr16.05 and Deutsche Bank declined 2.4 per cent to EUR49.42.
In Frankfurt, the Xetra Dax moved 0.9 per cent lower to 5,957.43. While it failed to defend the 6,000 mark it reached 
on Tuesday, it nevertheless ended its last trading session this year 23.9 per cent higher on the year - its best 
annual gain since 2007. In Paris, the CAC 40 index was down 0.6 per cent to 3,935.50.
Ryanair dropped 3.6 per cent to EUR3.28 after the Italian civil aviation regulator said it was considering suing the 
Irish no-frills airline for libel in a dispute over check-in documents.

Danish wind power group Vestas rose 2.9 per cent to DKr317 after announcing two orders, one for 48 wind

next month and be replaced by Arzuhan Dogan Yalcindag, his daughter.
Dogan Yayin , the group's media arm, which has lately been embroiled in a public dispute with Turkey's 
government over a record $3.3bn tax fine, advanced 10 per cent to TL1.32 on hopes that Mr Dogan's resignation 
will ease tensions with the government.
The media group controls more than half of Turkey's print and broadcast media.
The company said the move was part of a broader restructuring plan, aimed at simplifying the management 
structure to help it "create strong foreign partnerships in investments abroad, to grow in stability and to protect and 
develop its existing economic strength".
Russia's Lukoil and Norway's Statoil both declined 1.2 per cent to Rbs1,688.06 and to NKr144.8, respectively, in 
spite of news that they had formally signed a contract with Iraqi authorities to develop Iraq's vast West Qurna 2 oil

The untapped reserves are seen by analysts as critical to the country's reconstruction hopes.

Ryanair said last week that it would stop domestic flights within Italy because of what it regards as reduced security 
check-in measures.
Danish wind power group Vestas rose 2.9 per cent to DKr317 after announcing two orders, one for 48 wind 
turbines for installation in Poland and another for 24 for installation in Spain.
Germany's leading cement producer HeidelbergCement moved down 0.7 per cent to EUR48.23 after it said it was 
seeking a new buyer for its operations in Israel as an agreement to sell to Mashav Initiating & Development had to 
be abandoned because of antitrust issues.
Lanxess , a leading speciality chemicals producer, dipped 1.6 per cent to EUR26.34 in spite of a positive note from 
WestLB.
The broker raised its target price to EUR31 from EUR26.
"We think it is important for investors to see now that, even in this significant downturn, the company was able to 
generate an operating profit level of around EUR400m or a margin of 8-9 per cent."

Ryanair is planning a third bid for Aer Lingus, according to a UK newspaper report.
Plans are being put together to bid for the carrier again, "sources close to Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary" 
told the Daily Mail.
The paper says the sources have declined to comment on a price.
Aer Lingus rose 3.8pc, or two cent, after the report, to close last night at 60c. Ryanair gained 0.6pc to 3.40, both on 
light volumes. Aer Lingus has remained unchanged this morning. The paper pointed out that the Aer Lingus board 
plans to meet with shareholders, including the government, which owns 25 per cent, on January 26. That is just 
days before a year-long bar under stock market rules that prevent Ryanair making a renewed bid is lifted. It quoted 
one source as saying: "Although O'Leary said he would only take over the company if it came grovelling, he has 
been in recent discussions to table a bid." Neither Ryanair nor Aer Lingus has commented on the report.

What are the main responsibilities of your job?
To ensure the overall quality and delivery of actuarial consulting solutions to clients. I ensure we create solid 
foundations for our clients to critically analyse the funding, cost, compliance and risk structures of the benefits 
provided to employees.
What are your professional motivators?
These are pretty exceptional times for companies providing pension benefits to employees. The challenges have 
never been greater for employers seeking to control costs in their core businesses. At the same time, they must 
manage costs associated with providing benefits in a climate of frequent regulatory and economic change. I want to 
be the trusted partner that eases the burden in relation to their benefit challenges and delivers a quality, valued-
added solution at a competitive cost.
How would you describe your work style?
Proactive, detail-oriented and, above all, client-focused. A customised offering is more important than ever in the 
current climate.
What is the best decision you have made in business?
I have worked in a much larger organisation in the past in a back-office role. Moving into a consulting environment 
and working for a smaller organisation, prior to Hewitt, enabled me to develop a much broader skill-set and a 
business perspective. Both are necessary in my current role.
What is the most valuable lesson you have learnt?
Working Week
As an actuary with a specialist, technical background, it can be easy to be too single-minded about the preferred 
outcome or technical solution. Understanding the specific needs of companies, from their perspective, is the key to 
finding the best solution and adding long term value.
Who do you most admire in Irish industry?
I admire Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair. Adding value is all about delivering the right solution at a 
predictable cost - with no surprises. O'Leary stands out for me as someone who anticipates needs and delivers cost 
effective solutions. His style is pretty individual.
What are your expectations for Irish business in the months ahead?
Companies are under considerable pressure to manage core business costs in an uncertain environment. This 
uncertainty can hinder longer term planning.
To encourage sustained economic growth, businesses must be willing to invest with long-term goals in mind.
What is your ultimate professional goal?
Our reason for being is to serve our clients well. We are a global organisation, but we have a local touch. Ultimately, 
we want to be the partner of choice in our business, helping to shape the right solutions for businesses whatever 
the challenges.

After the horror show of 2008, when every member of the Iseq index declined in value over the course of the year, 
2009 witnessed some of the most impressive rebounds in recent memory. The index neared the end of 2009 some 
30 per cent ahead of the level at which it had started it. This marked the beginning of a recovery after two years of 
successive collapses - the Iseq shed 63 per cent in 2008 and 37 per cent in 2007.
But, after a cumulative fall of 81 per cent between the all-time high just above 10,000 in February 2007 and the 
March 2009 low of 1,880, much of the damage remains to be undone. Despite this year's bounce back, the index 
remains anchored 70 per cent off its peak.
For shareholders in some companies, however, the performance of the wider benchmark will do little to take the 
shine off a spectacular year.
Exploration company Petroceltic had a stellar performance as chief executive Brian O'Cathain presided over a 
rocketing share price. Investors saw the value of their holdings soar by a multiple of six as O'Cathain made the 
most of a fundraising and took the company from a market capitalisation of just  28 million in January to almost  250 
million in December.
Petroceltic headed a pack of lowerprofile companies whose share price performance eclipsed bigger names such 
as the banks and index heavyweights CRH and Ryanair, which added 20 per cent and 15 per cent respectively.
Shareholders in the main banks had mixed results during the year:
investors in Anglo Irish Bank were wiped out when the ailing bank was nationalised in January. While the 
government signalled that it would appoint an independent assessor to establish whether shareholders should 
receive any payment in return for giving up their shares to the state, the process is unlikely to deliver any 
meaningful benefit.
Stocks assume the recovery position
There was better news for Irish Life & Permanent, which almost doubled in value over the course of 2009 and even 
managed to squeeze into the top ten performers in the Iseq.
But the bigger banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, reported diverging experiences during the year. Bank of Ireland was 
60 per cent ahead between January and mid-December, but AIB, which emerged as the more stressed of the two 
as the year progressed, was almost 30 per cent behind, and was firmly rooted among the poorest ten performers. In 
the absence of the traditional heavyweights, resources groups earned a place in the spotlight.
Kenmare, Dragon Oil and PetroNeft all figured in the top ten performers, with Kenmare finishing the year almost 
270 per cent higher. Dragon was 165 per cent ahead as the year came to a close, while PetroNeft, a recent entrant 
to the secondary IEX market in Dublin, was almost 150 per cent higher.
Of the more mainstream members of the Iseq, packaging giant Smurfit Kappa shrugged off concerns over its hefty 
debt pile by maintaining its track record of generating strong cashflows. It was ahead by 250 per cent.
The other main winners were niche financial services group IFG, which delivered returns of 220 per cent; specialist 
technology stock Norkom, which added 180 per cent over the year; drinks group C&C, which completed a number 
of high profile acquisitions to reduce its dependence on cider, and doubled in value; and recruitment group CPL, 
which added 90 per cent despite concerns over the impact of rising unemployment.
At the other end of the table, the bottom ten included well-known names such as Aer Lingus and Independent News 
& Media (INM).
Aer Lingus shares had begun 2009 boosted by the renewed interest of Ryanair, which had offered  1.40 per share 
with its second takeover bid. Despite the Aer Lingus board dismissing the offer as too low - just as it had done with 
the first  2.80 per share offer in 2007 - the airline's share price drifted in the wake of the rejection, and went on to 
shed more than 60 per cent of its value.
It remains to be seen whether Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary will proceed with another takeover offer but, 
with the Aer Lingus share price languishing at just over 50c, a third offer will not be as generous as those that went 
before.
INM, meanwhile, went into reverse, as markets took fright at its debt pile and pressure on cash flows arising from 
an advertising downturn in its main markets. Adjusting for a massive rights issue and a debt forequity swap that 
gave bondholders almost 50 per cent of the company, INM delivered negative returns that cut the value of an 
investment in the company in half.
Another company which endured a year to forget was Boundary Capital, the highly leveraged investment vehicle 
whose interests include stakes in fellow plcs Siteserv and the now de-listed Veris, as well as in Arnotts department 
store.
Boundary Capital spent December fighting it out for the title of worst-performing stock with AGI Therapeutics, which 
neared the year-end down by 70 per cent.

Fullers warns ofVAT rise to 22%

Body
One of the UK's leading regional brewers has said that VAT will have to rise to 22 per cent as a result of the poor 
state of public finances, a prospect that would cause dismay in leisure industries.
Michael Turner, executive chairman of Fuller Smith & Turner, the brewer of London Pride ale, said that the 
impending rise from 15 to 17.5 per cent would not be the last.
"I think we will have another couple of rises sadly. It is all quite worrying. I think it would have to go to 22 per cent. It 
is the only way I can see they can raise sufficient funds," Mr Turner told the Financial Times.
Many UK businesses are nervously eyeing the rise in VAT in the new year as they fear it could hit consumer 
demand. A rise to 22 per cent would be unwelcome in many industries.
However, Mr Turner said pubs would not be worse affected than other venues.
"It won't disadvantage the pub sector against anyone else. But we have had to keep up with the minimum wage and 
smoking ban. It's a lot to deal with," he added.
His comments reflect unease in the business community over how a future government - Labour or Conservative - 
will deal with the huge deficits that are a result of the financial crisis.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said 2010 would be a year for "austerity". He added that he was moving 
the focus of the low-cost airline away from the UK and Ireland towards continental Europe: "There has been 
massive government mismanagement [in the UK and Ireland]. The public finances are in a mess."
There has been some anecdotal evidence that the impending VAT increase has led to some consumers buying 
high-priced products before Christmas.
Inchcape, the international car dealership, said recently that buyers of expensive cars had brought their purchases 
forward.
Fullers warns ofVAT rise to 22%
Fullers has weathered the storm in the pub industry relatively well, helped by a low amount of debt compared with 
rivals and a focus on pubs and its retail beer business.
The company, which owns more than 300 pubs across southern England, defied a "challenging period" to report an 
18 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to £14.1m for the six months to September 26.

A passenger jet slid off the runway after landing at a Scottish airport yesterday and two people were killed in a 
coach crash in Cornwall, as snow and ice continued to pose a risk to pre-Christmas travellers.
The Ryanair aircraft with 129 people on board skidded after hitting a patch of ice, coming to a halt on grass just 30 
yards from Glasgow Prestwick airport's perimeter fence and the A79 dual carriageway. Relieved passengers 
praised the pilot for managing to avert a serious accident. They were able to get off the aircraft using the normal 
exits and were taken to the terminal building by bus. No one was injured and the aircraft was undamaged.
Police said two people were killed and 47 others injured when a coach overturned on Tuesday evening as they 
returned from a day trip to see the Christmas lights in the Cornish fishing village of Mousehole.
Meanwhile Eurostar, the cross-Channel rail operator hit by failures that had left thousands stranded earlier in the 
week, said its trains running from London were all full after a three-day stoppage. It appealed to passengers not to 
join the hundreds of people queuing at St Pancras station in the hope of travelling. Eurostar said it remained 
confident that everyone wanting to travel before Christmas would be able to do so.
Liverpool's John Lennon airport was closed last night owing to heavy snow. Earlier, flights from Luton, Gatwick, 
Heathrow, Glasgow and Edinburgh airports were disrupted by conditions and passengers were advised to check 
with airlines before going to the airport.
Replacement bus services for trains were operating in Kent and Surrey.
The Met Office issued severe weather warnings in the south-west, Midlands, Wales and north of England last night. 
The predicted minimum temperatures for last night were -2ºC in the Midlands, -4ºC in northern England, -10ºC in 
Glasgow and -15ºC in rural Scotland. Scotland would have freezing fog as a result.
Several main roads in the South were closed after rain fell on to frozen surfaces, causing a series of accidents. 
Roads are set for further icy conditions, prompting the Met Office warn of "widespread icy roads" for most of 
England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Jet slides off runway as freeze blasts travel
Stewart Stevenson, Scottish transport minister, said conditions on the roads were the worst for 20 years.
The AA said it was receiving 1,200 breakdown calls an hour and urged motorists to delay their journeys to allow 
black ice to melt.
Edmund King, AA president, accused some councils of not acting quickly enough to grit roads and claimed some 
key roads had "not been gritted at all". The Local Government Association said the claims were "unverified and 
unjustified". But Cornwall county council confirmed the road on which the fatal coach crash occurred had not been 
gritted because it was classed as a minor one.

Ryanair will temporarily stop domestic Italian flights at 10 airports from January 23 because of a row with regulator 
ENAC over check-in documents, the airline has said.
The carrier objects to ENAC's decision to cut requirements on documents that passengers have to present.
The airline argues the new requirements will not provide a secure form of identification, it said in a statement.
"It is incorrect for ENAC to introduce measures that reduce security on domestic Italian flights compared to security 
measures used successfully on all other EU and domestic flights operated by Ryanair in other EU countries," it 
said. Ryanair said the documents which ENAC had approved for identification include fishing permits and company 
IDs and that under the November decision Ryanair personnel are subject to arrest if they don't accept these 
documents at check-in. Italy is one of Ryanair's major markets and the 10 bases where flights would be stopped 
include Bergamo, which serves Milan, and Rome's Ciampino airport. ENAC was not available to comment. (c)

Ryanair is threatening to stop domestic flights in Italy starting next month amid a dispute with the country's 
authorities over new rules on ID documents that passengers can show at airport gates.
Domestic flights operated at 10 Italian airports, including Rome and Milan, will be grounded from Jan. 23 until the 
issue is resolved, the Irish budget airline said in a statement posted Wednesday on its Italian Web site.
Last month, Italy's civil aviation authority, known by the acronym ENAC, ordered airlines to accept driving licenses, 
government badges, fishing and hunting licenses and other documents to identify passengers at boarding gates for 
domestic flights.
Ryanair said that since it started operating entirely with online check-ins, passengers are asked at booking time to 
show their passport or identity card before boarding. It said in the statement that the documents now allowed are 
less secure and this threatens flight security.
"We are really sorry for the inconveniences that this decision will cause," Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said in the 
statement.
"It's completely inappropriate for ENAC to introduce measures that reduce security on Italian domestic flights, 
compared with the security measures successfully used on all Ryanair flights in the EU and all Ryanair domestic 
flights in every other EU country," he said.
ENAC dismissed Ryanair's protests, saying that the new rules were based on a law passed in 2000 and that all 
other carriers had complied with them.
"No carrier can operate on the national domestic market without respecting the rules," the authority said in a 
statement. "Ryanair is the only EU and international operator that demands to fly in Italy without respecting Italian 
law."
ENAC said it would lodge a protest with the Irish civil aviation authority and inform Italian Foreign Minister Franco 
Frattini of the situation.
Ryanair threatens to stop local flights in Italy
Last week, an administrative tribunal in Rome rejected Ryanair's request to suspend the new rules. The company 
said Wednesday it would appeal to a higher administrative court.

(RTTNews) - More than 80 people have died across Europe as the cold wave continued to sweep severely 
disrupting rail, road and air traffic.
At least 42 deaths have been reported from Poland and another 27 from Ukraine, while 13 people died in car 
accidents in Austria, Finland and Germany, where the temperature dropped well below zero, BBC reported.
Air, rail and road transport remained disrupted across northern Europe as more snow is expected. The disruption 
has come during the busy Christmas holiday season, affecting people&apos;s travel plans.
The bitterly cold weather across much of the continent combined with heavy snow in some areas has caused 
cancellations and delays at airports and forced train lines to close. However, after three days of cancelled services, 
Eurostar trains started running between Brussels, Paris and London. Domestic rail services across the UK have 
been severely delayed, with buses replacing trains in many areas.
The backlog of thousands of stranded travellers was expected to take several days to clear.
British Airways said majority of its flights were operating again after it had cancelled all its domestic and European 
flights from the Heathrow airport, one of the busiest in Europe. Other airlines, including EasyJet and Ryanair, have 
cancelled several flights.
Frankfurt airport, Europe&apos;s third largest, re-opened Tuesday morning after closing on Monday because of icy 
conditions. In France, Belgium and the Netherlands, airport operators cleared runways after thick snowfall caused 
major disruption to flight schedules.
Road traffic was severely disrupted across the UK, including the southeast where roads were gridlocked late on 
Monday after numerous accidents in heavy snowfall. Major roads elsewhere in Europe were blocked after some 
regions had snowfall of up to 50cm (20in).
The Eurostar rail crisis prompted the French transport ministry to order a probe into the shutdown.
Meanwhile, Eurotunnel, which carries vehicles under the English Channel between England and France, cancelled 
day trip bookings Tuesday and warned that heavy traffic levels were expected through the day.
Cold Wave Continues To Sweep Europe; 80 Dead So Far
In Poland, police sought people&apos;s help to locate homeless or drunk people lying outside, as temperatures 
dropped towards minus 20C in some areas. Most of the 42 people who froze to death in that country over the 
weekend were homeless, police said.
The cold sweep calimed the lives two homeless people in France. Fifty people were injured when a train hit a buffer 
in the Croatian city of Zagreb, while 36 were wounded when a passenger train derailed in Paris after a car slipped 
on ice and knocked concrete on to the tracks.

In his poem "To a Louse", Robert Burns, Scotland's bard, set out the first principle of public relations: O wad some 
Power the giftie gie us To see oursels as ithers see us! It wad frae mony a blunder free us, An' foolish notion.
There were many without the giftie in 2009, so let us review just three from the last few weeks.
First, Dubai. In late November, Dubai World, the emirate's flagship company, stunned the markets by saying it 
wanted to postpone paying its debts for six months. Could Dubai ever be trusted again? As the world fretted, Dubai 
closed down to mark the Eid al-Adha holiday.
This newspaper's role is to explain the financially incomprehensible, but we were stumped. Dubai's behaviour, we 
said, "is genuinely baffling" .
A more conventional group of blunderers were British Airways' cabin crew. It is an often-told story of industrial strife. 
An abrasive management attempts to force through some change in working practices. The change seems trivial to 
outsiders, but to the employees it is the last straw.
Any workplace is filled with the buzz of who is up, who is down, who said what to whom. During times of anxiety, 
the buzz turns into a clamour, with everyone reinforcing everyone's else's sense of grievance and betrayal. The 
workers meet. They vote to strike. Sometimes their friends and neighbours sympathise. At other times, they say: 
"What on earth are you doing?"
Which is what happened to the BA cabin crew. It is not that I envy their job. It looks cramped and tiring. It cannot be 
easy being nice to people who are not always nice back. But anyone can see that BA is on the brink. It lost a record 
£401m last year. Rivals such as EasyJet and Ryanair operate at a fraction of BA's cost. BA management's decision 
to cut cabin crew numbers by at least one per aircraft no doubt made the job harder, but it is surely preferable to 
going out of business.
Time for the blinkers to come off in business class
The union called the strike over the Christmas holidays, throwing 1m passengers' plans into chaos. Honeymoons 
were threatened, family reunions imperilled. Emerging from the fevered solidarity of their union meetings, the BA 
staff were stunned by the public anger.
A flight attendant, stopping to fill up on her way home from Heathrow, reported that a man had spat in her face. 
Staff were advised not to wear their uniforms in public. Last week, the high court stopped the strike in response to 
BA's claims of irregularities in the ballot. The cabin crew should now spend some time rethinking their tactics.
Bankers do not wear an easily identifiable uniform, which probably protects them from people at filling stations. But 
their feel for the public mood makes the flight attendants look like a bunch of PR smoothies.
Consider: a series of blunders by the banking industry plunged the world into the worst financial crisis since the 
1930s. Disaster was averted only by massive infusions of public money and, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, 
government guarantees of the banks. The consequence was the devastation of public finances. Children now in 
primary school will probably still be paying the bill as adults.
In the UK, Alistair Darling, the chancellor of the exchequer, announced in his pre-Budget report that public sector 
workers would face three years of real pay cuts. From 2011, everyone earning over £20,000 would pay more tax. 
The City said this was not enough. There would have to be swingeing cuts in public services once next year's 
election was out of the way.
But the City, by its own estimation, was different. It needed to pay bonuses to retain top talent. Mr Darling said he 
would prefer banks to shore up their capital. He imposed a 50 per cent tax on banks paying staff bonuses of more 
than £25,000.
The result was an eruption of fury the likes of which I have not witnessed in 25 years of reporting on British 
business, with bankers threatening to leave the UK. Tullett Prebon went so far as to offer its 700 London-based 
brokers the chance to move elsewhere.
The supertax has flaws. It hits those institutions that required direct financial support and those that did not, the 
innocent as well as the guilty. But the cuts in public services will fall with indiscriminate force too. Does the City 
think any government could survive slashing public services while the banks, held by most to have caused the crisis 
in the first place, paid out millions in bonuses?
It matters to me that the City survives and thrives, but then my job depends on it. If bankers really do leave for Zug 
or Singapore, I suspect most of Britain will ask if they would like directions to the airport.
Whoever leaves or stays, London will retain a sizeable financial community. Its leaders need to think about how 
they explain their value and worth to their fellow residents. Their recent display of petulance does them no favours.

BAA break-up thrown into turmoil
BAA break-up thrown into turmoil

Group wins appeal over alleged bias
Chance to try to overturn sale ruling
Body
The forced break-up of BAA, owner of London's Heathrow and some other airports, was in turmoil last night after it 
won its appeal over alleged bias by the UK competition watchdog.
The decision gives BAA - which is owned by Spain's Ferrovial and has auctioned off London Gatwick for £1.5bn 
($2.4bn) - an opportunity to try to overturn a regulatory ruling forcing it to sell Stansted airport as well as either 
Glasgow and Edinburgh airports.
The twist drew an angry reaction from the numerous critics of the BAA's two-decade-old near-monopoly.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, called for the sales to go ahead as planned to "speed up the 
introduction of competition, lower costs and service improvements for airlines and consumers at Stansted and the 
Scottish airports". He said "All BAA is trying to do is delay the sale."
The Competition Appeal Tribunal unanimously ruled yesterday that there was "a real possibility of bias" in the 
Competition Commission's investigation of BAA because of the participation of Professor Peter Moizer, as a 
member of the inquiry team.
Prof Moizer is a long-standing adviser to the Greater Manchester Pension Fund, the retirement scheme for the 10 
local authorities in the Greater Manchester area. These local authorities jointly own Manchester Airport Group, 
which controls Manchester airport, as well as other airports in the UK.
MAG played an active role in the inquiry and identified itself in the early stages of the process as a potential 
acquirer of airports which might come on to the market, including BAA airports. When BAA put Gatwick airport up 
for sale, MAG and GMPF formed part of one of the bidding consortia.
BAA break-up thrown into turmoil
The tribunal will decide next year on what action should be taken, although it called on the company and watchdog 
to hold talks before. BAA said it would talk to the regulator "to determine the appropriate response to this 
judgment''.
The BAA investigation was a flagship probe for the regulator, which rejected BAA's argument that selling Gatwick 
alone would be enough to remove competition concerns created by its market share of 90 per cent of airport 
passenger traffic in south-east England and 84 per cent in Scotland.
The airport sales could scarcely have come at a worse time for BAA, in the midst of the credit crunch and the 
economic downturn and as passenger volumes at the airports fell steeply.
The Commission said it was disappointed with the decision. It pointed out that the ruling did not state there was 
actual bias in the investigation. Prof Moizer declined to comment.

The forced break-up of BAA, owner of Heathrow and some of Britain's other big airports, was in turmoil last night 
after the company won its appeal over alleged bias by the competition watchdog.

No-frills airline, Ryanair, today said that it will begin accepting Laser card payments on its Website portal from the 
end of January next.
MasterCard Prepaid will remain Ryanair's free form of payment while other payment methods, including Laser, are 
subject to E5 administration charges.
Earlier this month, Ryanair brought in a E5 / £5 charge on travellers using Visa Electron.
The airline claims the decision to introduce charges on Visa Electron was because Mastercard's prepaid cards were 
more widely available than Visa Electron, which is not available in Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands or Portugal. It 
said it would introduce its own Ryanair-branded prepay card, although it has not yet disclosed the commercial terms 
and conditions. In Ireland, however, Ryanair's prepay card costs E85 to set up. The airline currently charges £5 a 
passenger for each journey on all flights booked using a credit or debit card, meaning two adults booking return 
flights face charges of £20 even if the flights are paid for on the same card during the same transaction.

News In Brief
## Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary is ready to retire in three years, when the low-cost airline will need a 
different style of manager, he said in a weekend interview. He said he had been needed at Ryanair while it was 
growing rapidly and cutting costs. "But once they're all done, you then need to hand over to somebody who's a bit 
more respectful to politicians and bureaucrats: talks about caring about the environment and old people and f***ing 
jungles, and all that s***te," he told the Financial Times. O'Leary also launched a scathing attack on US planemaker 
Boeing over failed negotiations to buy 200 new airliners. "Our share price has suffered uncertainty over the last six 
months and eventually you lose patience with a bunch of idiots who can't make a decision," he said. - Irish 
Independent
## Almost 1,000 workers at Bord Gais will receive a 3.5pc pay rise this week, with the possibility of a further 2.5pc 
hike early next year. The semi state company last week sanctioned the pay rise, which will cost the company more 
than 2.3m euro a year. Bord Gais staff already earn an average of 67,000 euro each. The Labour Court ruled two 
months ago that more than 900 employees of the company were entitled to a raise under the national wage 
agreement. - Sunday Business Post
## German Chancellor Angela Merkel has defended the non-binding deal on climate change produced at the 
Copenhagen summit. She said negative comments about the agreement were unproductive. "It is a first step 
toward a new world climate order, nothing more but also nothing less," she told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. 
"Those who are only putting Copenhagen down are helping those who want to blockade rather than move forward." 
Ms Merkel said Germany had a key role to play in advancing the process as the host of a follow-up meeting of 
environment ministers in the western city of Bonn in June. - RTE ## Irish and foreign-owned companies added less 
than 4,000 net jobs in the international tradable goods and services sectors in the 10 years 1999-2008, as overall 
O'Leary now set to go in three years ? O'Leary To Go?
employment grew by more than half a million. This is according to analysis by Michael Hennigan, founder andeditor 
of www.finfacts.ie. To get employment back to the mid-2008 level would need the creation of 160,0000 new jobs, 
which is a "daunting challenge", he said. "There are no simple panaceas but an analysis by Finfacts highlights a 
number of issues," he said. Mr Hennigan stresses the need to create a competitive environment where the 
economy can flourish. He criticises the failure of governments to exploit the food sector more effectively, which has 
a proven track record. - Irish Examiner ## Property developer Bernard McNamara is to appeal a High Court 
judgement that he must pay 63m euro to a group who loaned him money to invest in the Irish Glass Bottle site. He 
is expected to seek a stay on the payment to the group of investors , pending his appeal to the Supreme Court. The 
Commercial Court last week ruled that he must pay the money to the group of investors who, along with the Clare 
businessman, part-funded the purchase of the site at Ringsend in Dublin. - Sunday Business Post ## Irish Rail is 
expected to seek leave in the High Court for a judicial review of an Equality Tribunal ruling that awarded a female 
employee a record 189,000 euro for victimisation and discrimination. The semi-state giant is also expected to 
appeal the ruling to the Labour Court. The employee's solicitor, John Kealy, said he found it "extraordinary that 
Iarnrod Eireann will go to such lengths to fight gender equality" - Irish Independent. ## More than 2,000 young 
people who have almost completed apprenticeships will not get qualifications next year as expected because they 
are unable to secure work placements. The Labour Party is calling on the Government to ensure all building 
projects paid for by the state use a certain number of apprentices on work placements so they can get qualifications 
in the trades they have trained for. New figures from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, show 
that, of those due to complete their apprenticeships in the next six to 12 months, 2,365 are unable to get work 
placements which are necessary for qualifications in their trades. - Irish Examiner ## Coillte, the commercial semi-
state forestry company, is planning a move into the nursing home development market as it seeks profitable uses 
for its 1m acres. The board will this week submit applications for five nursing homes around the country, ahead of 
an end-of-year deadline to take advantage of the expiring capital allowance incentive scheme for such projects. - 
Sunday Times ## The men behind the Porterhouse craft brewery are turning their attention to the whiskey market. 
Oliver Hughes and Liam LaHart have teamed up with Kerry businessman Jerry O'Sullivan to establish Dingle 
Whiskey Distillery. They are in the process of raising 800,000 euro via a Business Expansion Scheme to fund part 
of the 2.9m euro development. The directors are putting 900,000 euro of their own funds into the project, which will 
also receive grant aid of 400,000 euro. The balance - a further 800,000 euro - is being raised from "founding 
fathers" - investors who will have access to the distillery and ownership of their own customised whiskey. - Irish

News In Brief
## Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary is ready to retire in three years, when the low-cost airline will need a 
different style of manager, he said in a weekend interview. He said he had been needed at Ryanair while it was 
growing rapidly and cutting costs. "But once they're all done, you then need to hand over to somebody who's a bit 
more respectful to politicians and bureaucrats: talks about caring about the environment and old people and f***ing 
jungles, and all that s***te," he told the Financial Times. O'Leary also launched a scathing attack on US planemaker 
Boeing over failed negotiations to buy 200 new airliners. "Our share price has suffered uncertainty over the last six 
months and eventually you lose patience with a bunch of idiots who can't make a decision," he said. - Irish 
Independent
## Almost 1,000 workers at Bord Gais will receive a 3.5pc pay rise this week, with the possibility of a further 2.5pc 
hike early next year. The semi state company last week sanctioned the pay rise, which will cost the company more 
than 2.3m euro a year. Bord Gais staff already earn an average of 67,000 euro each. The Labour Court ruled two 
months ago that more than 900 employees of the company were entitled to a raise under the national wage 
agreement. - Sunday Business Post
## German Chancellor Angela Merkel has defended the non-binding deal on climate change produced at the 
Copenhagen summit. She said negative comments about the agreement were unproductive. "It is a first step 
toward a new world climate order, nothing more but also nothing less," she told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. 
"Those who are only putting Copenhagen down are helping those who want to blockade rather than move forward." 
Ms Merkel said Germany had a key role to play in advancing the process as the host of a follow-up meeting of 
environment ministers in the western city of Bonn in June. - RTE ## Irish and foreign-owned companies added less 
than 4,000 net jobs in the international tradable goods and services sectors in the 10 years 1999-2008, as overall

employment grew by more than half a million. This is according to analysis by Michael Hennigan, founder andeditor 
of www.finfacts.ie. To get employment back to the mid-2008 level would need the creation of 160,0000 new jobs, 
which is a "daunting challenge", he said. "There are no simple panaceas but an analysis by Finfacts highlights a 
number of issues," he said. Mr Hennigan stresses the need to create a competitive environment where the 
economy can flourish. He criticises the failure of governments to exploit the food sector more effectively, which has 
a proven track record. - Irish Examiner ## Property developer Bernard McNamara is to appeal a High Court 
judgement that he must pay 63m euro to a group who loaned him money to invest in the Irish Glass Bottle site. He 
is expected to seek a stay on the payment to the group of investors , pending his appeal to the Supreme Court. The 
Commercial Court last week ruled that he must pay the money to the group of investors who, along with the Clare 
businessman, part-funded the purchase of the site at Ringsend in Dublin. - Sunday Business Post ## Irish Rail is 
expected to seek leave in the High Court for a judicial review of an Equality Tribunal ruling that awarded a female 
employee a record 189,000 euro for victimisation and discrimination. The semi-state giant is also expected to 
appeal the ruling to the Labour Court. The employee's solicitor, John Kealy, said he found it "extraordinary that 
Iarnrod Eireann will go to such lengths to fight gender equality" - Irish Independent. ## More than 2,000 young 
people who have almost completed apprenticeships will not get qualifications next year as expected because they 
are unable to secure work placements. The Labour Party is calling on the Government to ensure all building 
projects paid for by the state use a certain number of apprentices on work placements so they can get qualifications 
in the trades they have trained for. New figures from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, show 
that, of those due to complete their apprenticeships in the next six to 12 months, 2,365 are unable to get work 
placements which are necessary for qualifications in their trades. - Irish Examiner ## Coillte, the commercial semi-
state forestry company, is planning a move into the nursing home development market as it seeks profitable uses 
for its 1m acres. The board will this week submit applications for five nursing homes around the country, ahead of 
an end-of-year deadline to take advantage of the expiring capital allowance incentive scheme for such projects. - 
Sunday Times ## The men behind the Porterhouse craft brewery are turning their attention to the whiskey market. 
Oliver Hughes and Liam LaHart have teamed up with Kerry businessman Jerry O'Sullivan to establish Dingle 
Whiskey Distillery. They are in the process of raising 800,000 euro via a Business Expansion Scheme to fund part 
of the 2.9m euro development. The directors are putting 900,000 euro of their own funds into the project, which will 
also receive grant aid of 400,000 euro. The balance - a further 800,000 euro - is being raised from "founding 
fathers" - investors who will have access to the distillery and ownership of their own customised whiskey. - Irish

* Deutsche Bank has buys for Barclays, Lloyds and RBS and holds on HSBC and Standard Chartered.
The broker expects little improvement in market risk appetite towards these stocks in the very near term given the 
lack of meaningful newsflow form the banks themselves until the results season begins in February. Deutsche 
believes the key risk to the performance of the UK banks is the potential for an increase in wholesale funding costs 
for the group, perhaps linked to changed perceptions around the outlook for inflation, sovereign risk or the solvency 
of the institutions themselves.
* Panmure Gordon has a buy and 520p target for ICAP, a sell for Luminar, cutting target to 34p from 73p and a hold 
for National Express.
* Canaccord Adams has a buy and 80p target for TEG Environmental and a buy and 110p target for Sunkar 
Resources
* FinnCap maintains buy for Hunting
* Citigroup has a buy and 4.20 target for Ryanair
* Numis has a hold and 900p target for Aggreko, a hold and £21.95 target for Carnival, a buy and £10.50m target 
for London Stock Exchange and a hold and 90p target for Topps Tiles
* Altium upgrades Bodycote to hold from sell with a 155p target

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has lashed out at Boeing after an agreement for the sale of 200 new jets 
was scuppered over contract conditions.
The controversial businessman criticised the US aircraft makers for ''Mickey Mouse'' delivery conditions, and 
described them as ''a bunch of idiots'' and ''numpties''.
O'Leary also said the failed deal meant expansion plans for Ryanair would be slowed. In an interview with the 
Financial Times, published this weekend, the Ryanair boss said a price had been agreed for the 737 jets, which 
were scheduled to be sent from Boeing's Seattle assembly plant between 2013 and 2016.
However, he claimed the aircraft maker had insisted on a series of delivery conditions, which Ryanair could not 
agree to.
''Our share price has suffered uncertainty over the last six months [because of the negotiations]... and eventually 
you lose interest with a bunch of idiots who can't make a decision," he said.
The knock-on effect for Ryanair, Europe's fastest growing carrier, is that expansion will be reduced and there is a 
likelihood of a special dividend being paid every second year from an increasing cash fund at the airline, according 
to O'Leary.
''There's going to be very significant dividends from 2012 onwards," he said.
O'Leary told the Financial Times that he would retire in three years, by which time he said Ryanair would need a 
different style of chief executive.
''I think you need me for the rapid growth and for the in cost reduction initiatives," he said, ''but once they're all done 
you then need to hand over to somebody who's a bit more respectful of politicians and bureaucrats, talks about 
caring about the environment and old people and f***ing jungles and fish in the sea and all that shite."

The Public Relations Institute of Ireland (PRII) is offering a course and a certificate in social media.
The course will take place over four days in early 2010 and costs  1,800 (or  1,450 for PRII members).
This seems like very good value. It is not easy to enter the world of social media. Facebook, MySpace and Twitter 
are baffling.
You cannot simply log on, register for free and start exploring.
One wrong word and the internet could turn against you. One misguided click and you could be facing the ruination 
of your company, the obliteration of your reputation and even the loss of your liberty. That's right:
the police could intervene.
So why take a chance?
The internet and social media are very frightening and enormously complicated.
And they are minefields. They are the Wild West. That is why it is far better to have the presence and guidance of 
an expert to get you through the whole experience, with handouts, cappuccinos and reassuring suits. Another 
reason for getting a certificate in social media is US President Barack Obama.
He did social media. And look where he is now.
A certificate in social media is highly respected in Irish business circles. Despite the recession and the near-
collapse of our industrial base, major Irish companies are known to be paying big money for social media 
graduates. The combination of internet browsing, tweeting and Facebooking skills are acknowledged as a prize 
asset for under-pressure Irish firms.

''One of our aims in 2010 is to open three new airline routes in eastern Europe," said Michael O'Leary, chief 
executive of Ryanair, the 'no-frills' airline.
''But we won't even consider embarking on that journey without someone who knows which Mafia Wars tribes are 
worth joining or which Miley Cyrus Twitter accounts are real and which ones are false.
''Our company is all about the bottom line. And how can you deliver that if you don't know how to organise a Tweet-
up? So if you're applying for a job with us and don't have a social media cert, sod off. If you do, welcome to 
Europe's fastest growing airline."
Other influential business and financial commentators are equally forthright.
This newspaper's economic columnist, David McWilliams, is believed to have signed a six-figure deal with Penguin 
International for an upcoming book, provisionally entitled If You Can't Stand The Tweet, Get Out Of The Market.
The PRII's social media division is understood to be considering a follow-up course in the summer of 2010.
The purpose of the course is believed to be an exploration of how hardcore online gaming can realise significant 
relationships with core target demographics for Irish organisations. The course will offer a diploma in online gaming 
and will be conducted over four nights (1.30am to 5.30am) entirely over Xbox Live.
The diploma will be awarded to candidates who pass a fragging quota, with a bonus qualification awarded to 
applicants who succeed in hotwiring their devices to download Film Four movies.

Shannon Airport discovered the hard way last week that Michael O'Leary was not bluffing with his recent threats to 
dramatically reduce Ryanair's services at the airport.
Ryanair's chief executive announced he was switching some of the capacity previously deployed at Shannon to 
Kerry and Knock. It was the latest in a series of surgical strikes with which O'Leary is punishing Shannon Airport 
Authority for refusing to meet his demands for lower landing charges.
Ryanair is believed to be seeking reductions of as much as 50 per cent on its existing five-year deal, which expires 
in April. The airport authority, however, has argued that it needs Ryanair to pay charges that more closely reflect 
the cost of providing it with landing and passenger handling services.
O'Leary, perhaps spurred on by a high-profile conflict with aircraft manufacturer Boeing over a  10 billion deal, 
appears unlikely to lose much sleep over the row with Shannon, just one of the 39 airports at which he has set up a 
base.
Early next year, he looks set to press the button on further capacity reductions that will shrink Ryanair's presence in 
the mid-west from its peak of six aircraft to just one.
For Shannon, the decision to stand up to O'Leary's hardened negotiating tactics looks brave but ultimately costly. 
Ryanair has been the airport's biggest customer for years and received particular credit for maintaining links with 
London and the continent when Aer Lingus controversially axed its services to London Heathrow in 2007.
But while Aer Lingus recently reinstated the ShannonHeathrow link - partly because O'Leary had pledged to do so if 
last year's second takeover bid for the former national carrier was successful - Ryanair's activities at its Shannon 
base are dwindling rapidly.
O'Leary turned up the heat on the airport authority in recent months after being incensed by the  10 departure tax 
imposed by the government last year, a move he described as counterproductive, ''insane'' and ''stupid''.
O'Leary plays his ace in Shannon costs wrangle
Loudly trumpeting the fact that many of his passengers pay less than  10 for their plane ticket, O'Leary has used the 
new tax as yet another stick with which to beat regional airports that, whether they like it or not, become heavily 
dependent on Ryanair to provide them with the lifeblood of passengers and routes.
He has argued that the existence of the tax forces airlines to cut fares even further to drum up business in an 
environment of collapsing disposable income - and that airports must share some of the pain this involves.
With Aer Lingus experiencing a financial crisis that has seen it seek to retrench heavily on short-haul operations, 
and overseas operators reluctant to add or even preserve capacity on Irish routes, Ireland's under-pressure airports 
are finding that O'Leary's unpleasant negotiating style may still be a more attractive option than having no-one to 
negotiate with at all.
A quick glance at Shannon's route map throws into focus the airport's dependence on Ryanair to generate much of 
its traffic. The no-frills carrier accounted for 60 per cent of the 3 million passengers that used Shannon last year. 
Worryingly for Shannon, this represented a bigger slice of a smaller pie, as Ryanair had carried 46 per cent of the 
airport's 3.6 million passengers a year earlier.
If O'Leary's threats become promises in April, Shannon will have just two Ryanair routes operating daily - to 
London's Stansted and Gatwick airports. The remainder will consist of onceor twice weekly services to a sharply 
reduced number of destinations on the continent.
Without a significant Ryanair presence, Shannon can look only to Aer Lingus, whose operations consist solely of 
routes to Heathrow and those that stop off in Shannon between Dublin and the US, and a handful of other services 
that include one transatlantic route operated by US carrier Continental, charter flights and stopovers involving US 
military personnel.
This will have not gone unnoticed by O'Leary. The Ryanair chief executive makes no secret of his desire - and 
ability - to extract major concessions from any supplier that needs him more then he needs them.
He has developed considerable experience of handling airports, signalling that he is prepared to completely 
withdraw a Ryanair presence if necessary, so as to maximise Ryanair's profits on the routes involved.
While he has a long track record of throwing his toys out of the pram in his dealings with bigger airports such as 
Dublin and Stansted, frequently ridiculing regulators that authorise increases in charges at each, these locations 
have the luxury of knowing that O'Leary would be loathe to leave them.
The category in which Shannon finds itself, however, has no such comfort blanket. O'Leary could not stand by and 
leave an opening for a major rival such as Aer Lingus or Easyjet to enjoy a dominant position in Dublin or Stansted.
But no such deterrent exists in Shannon.
The authority appears to be in the unenviable position of having to hold firm against Ryanair and losing much of its 
current traffic, or undercutting its existing arrangement and retaining the passengers but at enormous cost to its 
bottom line.
The collapse of a large number of major airlines on the continent has thrown up major opportunities for Ryanair, as 
airports that need planes outbid each other to attract the relatively few healthy carriers still in business.
But it has been bad news for Shannon, which could be about to witness first hand that, if it decides not to deal, 
there are too many airports elsewhere in Europe that will meet O'Leary's terms.
Kerry and Knock chose to make the most of the impasse last week. But with a relatively fixed cost base and a sharp 
drop in variable revenues only a few weeks away, Shannon's room for manoeuvre looks limited. This is just as 
O'Leary would have wanted it.

Whether it was yet another bluff or a rare case of Michael O'Leary failing to get his own way, Ryanair shares rose 
by 6 per cent on Friday after the airline announced the breakdown of talks with US aircraft giant Boeing on a 
mammoth deal involving 200 new planes.
Although both sides appeared to have agreed on price, O'Leary blamed the breakdown on Boeing's refusal to 
''incorporate some other terms and conditions from our existing agreement into this new aircraft order''.
''Ryanair has made clear to Boeing that we will not order aircraft if we believe that either the pricing or the other 
contractual terms and conditions will be inferior to those which we currently enjoy, as this would not be a wise or 
sensible use of shareholders' funds," he said. Instead, he looked set to carry out his threat to use the cash that 
would have gone to Boeing in other ways.
He reiterated previous hints that the airline would change its strategy from one of adding new planes and more 
routes to one of focusing on generating cash from existing operations, using surplus cash to fund share buybacks 
or even pay dividends for the first time in Ryanair's history.
But O'Leary could have some explaining to do. His radical change in tactics may upset those shareholders who 
bought into the airline on the basis of its growth prospects.
They may question why, if running the airline for cash is the better option, was O'Leary preparing to commit 
upwards of  100 billion to buying new aircraft and query why he only changed his mind when talks were at an 
advanced stage.
They may also express concern that Ryanair's future strategy has been dictated not by O'Leary's vision, but by the 
actions of Boeing's negotiating team. O'Leary may struggle to convince investors of the merits of pursuing a 
strategy that he had portrayed in the past as a fall-back option.
Stalled talks mean no fresh meat for Ryanair 's fleet
The breakdown in talks came as a surprise, as Boeing was believed to be keen on a fresh deal with Ryanair. The 
last major deal agreed between the sides, in the aftermath of the downturn that followed the September 11 attacks 
in the US in 2001,was a welcome boost to the aircraft manufacturer but paved the way for Ryanair to grow rapidly 
thanks to a steady supply of new planes at knockdown prices.
O'Leary first signalled that all was not well last month, when he criticised Boeing for failing to modify its pricing to 
suit him.
''All we're asking Boeing to do is share a very small fraction of cost reductions and productivity gains they've made 
in recent years through efficient manufacturing processes," he said at the time - effectively asking Boeing to share 
some of the benefits of running its business better with Ryanair.
By last week, however, it appeared that Boeing had met O'Leary's demands on price but that a new stumbling 
block, which was not present last month, had made an appearance.
Unlike the previous deal, however, O'Leary lacked the leverage that comes with having an alternative aircraft 
supplier on standby. While Ryanair had courted Airbus, Boeing's biggest rival, in the past, the France-based aircraft 
manufacturer had explicitly stated in recent months that it was unlikely to do a deal with O'Leary, as it felt he would 
seek prices that were commercially unviable.
Without Airbus in the background, O'Leary's main trump card in seeking to extract the optimal deal from Boeing was 
his alternative strategy - one that was less repugnant to Boeing than watching O'Leary hatching a deal with Airbus 
instead.
Regardless of whether it is O'Leary or Boeing that will have more to regret from the impasse, however, the decision 
to adopt a more conservative strategy that does not involve further rapid growth may yet work out in O'Leary's 
favour.
Committing to buy hundreds more aircraft in the current climate, when consumer spending is going into reverse and 
a host of airline failures are likely to trigger a huge supply of cheap, second-hand planes, may have been ambitious 
but also risky.
The consequences of having too many planes that are surplus to requirements because they cannot be filled tend 
to be expensive. O'Leary's replacement strategy carr ies the downside of limiting his growth and putting a halt to 
plans to add even more routes, but has fewother drawbacks. Ryanair could not continue growing forever. But it is 
far from certain that O'Leary picked the right time to take his foot off the gas.

Troubled skies lie ahead for Walsh

Christmas is back on for British Airways chief executive Willie Walsh, but like many a festive reveller he will have to 
pay for it in January.
A 12-day strike action at the airline has been averted, but not for long. After doing some close examination of the 
Unite union' ballot papers, BA's legal team found some voters had left the company. A court upheld BA's contention 
that the ballot was illegal, which prevented the cabin crew from striking over Christmas. This would have been a 
disastrous stoppage period for BA, and would have ruined Christmas travel plans for hundreds of thousands of 
customers.
Walsh got a stay of execution, but he'll have any thing but a fresh start in 2010.The union issue will be waiting for 
him in the new year, and although talks on an agreement between Unite and management are expected to resume, 
neither side has shown an appetite for compromise.
The former Aer Lingus boss took the reins at BA in 2005 with the aim of getting generous working agreements 
under control. Like most European flag carriers, BA has had the rug pulled from under it by low-cost rivals, such as 
Ryanair.
There are mixed views as to how Walsh is performing, but the rate of change has irritated many observers. There 
are a number of big issues facing BA. The main ones which confronted Walsh when he took up the job included the 
big decision regarding the updating of the fleet, addressing the pension deficit, tackling working practices and the 
cost base, and the move to Terminal Five in Heathrow.
One airlines analyst said: ''If you look at all of those, the only one which has been completed is the move to 
Terminal Five - and that had its teething problems." Teething problems is an understatement, as the initial transfer 
of operations to Terminal Five was a PR disaster which threatened to leave Walsh without a job.
The company had losses of »300 million in the first half of the year, an indication of the scale of restructuring which 
Walsh needs to make. He wants to cut 4,000 jobs at BA. There seems to be investor support for his tough stance 
Troubled skies lie ahead for Walsh
with the unions. While the strike over Christmas might seem like a PR catastrophe, the share price showed little 
movement when the actions were announced by Unite.
Estimates of the cost of the strike ranged from»60-»310 million, while some analysts have said a restructuring of 
staff arrangements would save BA »60 million a year.
Walsh earned the nickname 'Slasher' Walsh when he cut 2,500 jobs at Aer Lingus, but now the City is wondering if 
he is tough enough to get what he wants at BA. The company's 13,500 cabin staff have enviable conditions, such 
as generous stopover arrangements, and on average are paid almost £10,000 more than those in rival Easyjet.
The union has proved that it had no problem in damaging goodwill towards the airline by striking at one of the most 
emotionally fraught times of the year. The next strikes plans will no doubt be just as ruthless, although Christmas is 
BA's most vulnerable time.
The economic environment is also against Walsh. Estimates on the full extent of the losses for 2009/2010 vary 
considerably and are very dependent on the recovery of its US business. BA's business class seat sales on cross-
Atlantic routes have taken a considerable hit over the past year, but may bounce back as the US economy 
improves.
BA is also at risk of any new environmental tariffs which may be imposed on airlines. So, even without the industrial 
action problems the sector is facing in to headwinds.
Unite has indicated that it will not try to overturn the court's decision on the Christmas strike action. It is planning to 
re-ballot members swiftly, with strike action expected in the coming months. The legal challenge found the previous 
ballot to be illegal, but that does not take away from the fact that there was overwhelming staff support for the 
action.
While the staff at BA will head into 2010 hell bent on protecting their jobs, Walsh also knows that he may have to 
fight for his position.
There is growing frustration at the pace at which he is tackling the big issues at BA. Some investors are concerned 
that the business might go under before any meaningful restructuring of the cost base can take place. Some in the 
market wonder if Walsh will survive the turbulence of the year ahead.

Rebellious youths often mellow into conformity later in life. Does the same hold true for upstart companies?
The question was raised yesterday by the announcement from Ryanair that it was planning to scale back its rapid 
expansion in order to maximise the distribution of cash to shareholders between 2012 and 2015.
Such a move would be a big strategic shift, given that the abrasively successful Irish group has reinvested cash in 
the business instead of paying a dividend during its 12 years as a listed company.
But fast-growing companies that decide to reinvent themselves as income generators risk losing something 
valuable in the transition, says Joseph Lampel, a professor of strategy at London's Cass Business School .
He views Ryanair as a classic "breakthrough" company whose appeal is its ability to tear up the rule book, in this 
case by undermining the higher-cost business model that constrained older airlines, such as British Airways.
Shifting to a "consolidation" strategy can make innovative managers too focused on delivering stable income to 
investors, sacrificing sparkle for steadiness, says Prof Lampel.
"The financial forces push them towards conformity with other corporations," he says, adding that companies in this 
position often end up diversifying as a way of spreading risk.
He also adds that upstarts that embrace a consolidation strategy usually shut the door on their past: few are able to 
rediscover a freewheeling style should they tire of sober maturity.
Freek Vermeulen, an associate professor of strategic and international management at London Business School , 
agrees that it is very difficult for a company to regain its innovative edge after it has shifted focus from "exploration" 
to "exploitation".
He cites the example of Microsoft, which became much more a part of the corporate mainstream when it started 
paying dividends in 2003 but which has struggled to replicate the enormous PC-based success of Windows on the 
internet.
Ryanair ponders sober maturity
That said, Prof Vermeulen suggests that Ryanair's move to distributing cash would not be such an extreme step for 
the group, given that the roll-out of its low-cost network involved a fair amount of repetition as well as innovation.
In a conference call with analysts last month, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, appeared to anticipate fears 
that the company might become too focused on steady disbursements to shareholders.
He said that any cash distributions resulting from a change in strategy were likely to be one-offs rather than regular 
payments.
This approach may limit Ryanair's appeal to conventional income investors in the UK, who seek out companies that 
offer a steady stream of payments, and who have had to weather a succession of dividend cuts recently.
"We're not going to get into some kind of dividend stream," Mr O'Leary says.
"But I think you'll see very substantial one-off distributions every two or three years."
Investors will have to wait until the first quarter of 2010 for more detail on the revised strategy.

Insults fly after failed aircraft deal
'Special dividend' pay-outs announced
Body
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryan-air, launched a caustic attack on Boeing yesterday, accusing the US 
aircraft maker of being "a bunch of idiots" and "numpties" for failing to seal an agreement to sell him 200 new 737 
jets.
As a result of the ditched deal, the no-frills Irish airline - which has long boasted it is Europe's fastest growing carrier 
- would slow its growth and eventually start paying "a special dividend every second year" from a swelling cash pile, 
he said.
Mr O'Leary is well known for being outspoken but has until now been restrained in the level of vitriol directed at 
Boeing as he tried to secure the large order of aircraft, worth $15bn at catalogue prices.
He said a price had been agreed for the jets, due to be sent from Boeing's Seattle assembly plant between 2013 
and 2016, but the manufacturer had then insisted on a series of "Mickey Mouse" delivery conditions, which meant 
the deal failed.
"They had their chance," he told the Financial Times. "Eventually you lose interest dealing with a bunch of idiots 
who can't make a decision.
"Our share price has suffered uncertainty over the last six months [as a result of the negotiations]," he said. He 
could no longer put up with such instability because of "a bunch of numpties out in Seattle".
Boeing said it was "disappointed" that Ryanair , which is one of its biggest customers, did not choose to expand its 
fleet.
Ryanair chief in attack on Boeing
"We worked to find a solution that met Ryanair's needs and also made good business sense for Boeing," the 
manufacturer said.
Mr O'Leary negotiated what he has described as "rapacious" discounts on a large order of Boeing jets after the last 
aviation recession, following the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US and had been keen to repeat the exercise 
in the current industry downturn.
Analysts were divided about whether an airline that has grown for as long and as rapidly as Ryanair would actually 
start ratcheting back and paying dividends.
"Growth runs deep in the veins of this company," said Joe Gill of Bloxham stockbrokers in Dublin.
But Mr O'Leary, who has a 4 per cent stake in Ryan-air, insisted: "There's going to be very significant dividends by 
about 2012 onwards."
Others suggested Mr O'Leary was merely using Boeing as a cover for the fact that his business had reached the 
limits of growth.
"I'm delighted that Michael O'Leary now accepts what I've been saying for over a year," said Sir Stelios Haji-
Ioannou, EasyJet founder. "The era of endless fast growth and ever larger aircraft fleet is near its end."

If peace on earth at EasyJet still sounds implausible, goodwill between Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the airline's 
founder, and Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, is unimaginable.
They were at it again yesterday, like two pantomime rivals. A year after Sir Stelios started acting against 
entrepreneurial character by pleading publicly with EasyJet's board to be more cautious, it was Mr O'Leary's turn to 
confuse Central Casting. But is the Irishman's bravura performance as Mr Dull, the utility manager - offering surplus 
cash to shareholders - believable?
His medium-term, lower-growth soliloquy seems aimed at unsettling one part of the audience: Boeing, whose aim of 
selling 200 new airliners to Ryanair Mr O'Leary has now confounded.
The airline's short-term plans - based on a previously agreed order with the US manufacturer - still seem ambitious. 
They would push passenger numbers from 66m to 90m by 2012. But that just makes the prospect of Mr O'Leary 
taking a rest thereafter less credible. "If you'd asked me two days ago [if Ryanair would press ahead with the 
Boeing order], I'd have said O'Leary would go for broke," said one industry frequent flyer yesterday.
He may still do so. Even on the gloomiest current outlook for the world economy, it's unlikely Ryanair would get the 
same planes for less in a year or two's time. But that's the kind of bet the Ryanair boss likes to make. To stick with 
the conservative option, on the other hand, would require a shift in Mr O'Leary's personality greater than that 
undergone by Sir Stelios last year.
The EasyJet founder's attempt to turn that airline away from a growth path was only partly successful. But despite 
Sir Stelios's "I told you so" tone, Mr O'Leary looks an unlikely co-pilot on that mission. Ryanair investors hoping for 
a gift-wrapped dividend after 2012 will surely be disappointed - unless they can find a way to offer their voluble Irish 
boss's part to a slightly less outspoken Greek-Cypriot.

'menacing' chicken salad in his office at the city's airport. By Pilita Clark

Here," says Michael O'Leary, shoving something the size of a small grapefruit wrapped in red and white cardboard 
over the table in his office at Dublin airport. "Lunch."
There is an awkward silence.
You do not expect a banquet from a budget airline boss who has threatened to make his passengers pay to use the 
toilet.
And you do not want to upset a man who calls regulators "rapists", rivals "arseholes", and advises customers 
wanting a refund to "f*** off".
But what exactly has he given me here? Eventually, I make out the words on the wrapper and blurt: "Oh! A bagel!"
"It's got pesto," says O'Leary. "It was either that or McDonald's. I figured you for a bagel girl."
For himself, he has procured a grim-looking chicken salad, entombed in thick plastic, also from somewhere in the 
airport down the road. An aide arrives with two takeaway coffees. So begins lunch with one of the world's best-
known, least-loved and more improbable airline chief executives.
I had tried to persuade O'Leary's press officer that lunch in the office would be dull. Surely there was a restaurant 
he liked in Dublin? No. Lunch with the chief executive of Ryanair would be a Ryanair lunch: at the desk, just your 
basics, all expenses spared.
In the world of aviation, Ryanair is a phenomenon, a no-frills behemoth that has grown from a tiny operation which, 
in 1985, used to fly 5,000 passengers a year between Ireland and London in a single plane so small that, according 
to the company, its cabin crew had to be no taller than 5ft 2in. Since he took over in 1994 O'Leary has relentlessly

expanded, with 200 aircraft flying more than 60m passengers a year to 150 European destinations, from the Canary 
Islands to Constanta in eastern Romania.
Recession has sent bigger, older airlines around the world hurtling into the red. Yet Ryanair has fared much better, 
coupling average fares of just EUR32 with a ruthless drive to cut costs and push up revenues by charging for 
everything from checking in online to buying a cup of coffee on board.
In the middle of this year Ryanair had the highest market value of any airline in the world, after Singapore Airlines. 
On the day we meet, it is getting ready to announce another quarterly profit and expects to make at least EUR200m 
this year.
None of this is evident from Ryanair's Dublin airport headquarters. Plastic sacks of wastepaper are piled at the 
entrance. Boxes are stacked up in corridors inside. The paintwork is scruffy, the carpet tired.
The open-plan office feels barely as wide as one of Ryanair's Boeing jets, and nearly as cramped. There is a single 
aisle dividing tightly packed teams of surprisingly young-looking workers into departments such as marketing, sales 
and planning.
It looks less like one of the airline industry's financial success stories and more like a scene from the television 
comedy The Office . Except the workers in The Office  have bigger desks. And down at the end, peering out from 
behind the glass walls of his own modest office, is O'Leary.
Wearing jeans, open-necked checked shirt and sneakers, he looks a bit tired and pale up close. This could be 
because he and his wife Anita Farrell, a former banker, have three children under the age of eight. Or because he 
seems in a permanent state of exasperation with an endless number of irritants, including his own staff.
As I try to prise off the worryingly sturdy wrapper on the bagel, he says there are two "great things" about lunchtime 
in an out-of-the-way office like Ryanair's. "One, there's nowhere to go and eat," and two, the only time staff are 
allowed to use the internet for personal reasons is between five past one and five to two. "So they all tend to stay at 
their desks at lunch hour!"
The staff get another pasting as he moves on to talk about management consultants ("should all be euthanised") 
and MBAs ("bullshit"). "MBA students come out with, 'The customer's always right,'" he says, adopting a whiny 
voice. "Horseshit! The customer's usually wrong! And, 'My staff is my most important asset.' Bullshit! Staff is usually 
your biggest cost!"
It is hard to say how serious he is about this. Ryanair did once say it had issued a memo banning employees from 
charging their mobile phones at work to save on electricity bills. But this always sounded like another PR prank by 
O'Leary, whose flair for using the media is boundless.
Airline entrepreneurs have often revealed a talent for doing their own PR. Richard Branson flew in a hot air balloon 
for Virgin Atlantic. Stelios Haji-Ioannou wore orange jumpsuits for EasyJet. But O'Leary takes the practice to new 
heights.
It is not just his willingness to dress up as the Pope to publicise a new route to Rome. Or his (so far unrealised) 
threat to charge passengers to use the lavatory. It is the sheer savagery of his blasts that make him stand out on 
the featureless plains of modern corporate life.
For 20 bracing minutes, he runs through a list of his more egregious enemies. There are the "cretins" and "twerps" 
in the Civil Aviation Authority, the British body that regulates the "bloody evil empire" of BAA, the airport operator 
whose London monopoly was recently broken up, after prodding from O'Leary, who had griped incessantly about its 
charges.
There is the "big bloody supertanker" of Boeing, the US aircraft maker that O'Leary has been badgering for months 
to sell him 200 new jets at recessionary prices. And there is, visible right outside his office window, one of his most 
'It was either this or McDonald's ' Lunch with the FT: Michael O'Leary, the controversy-courting, cost-cutting 
chief executive of Ryanair , does not want to eat....
hated foes: Aer Lingus, the struggling Irish flag carrier for which O'Leary has made two thwarted bids in the past 
three years. "There it is," he hoots, jumping up out of his chair to point out a large squat building facing away from 
his own. "The gulag!"
He would clearly like to make a third offer for Aer Lingus, but knows this would mean trouble with its "bunch of 
bearded, sandal-wearing union bosses", not to mention Ireland's "utterly useless" politicians.
And then there is that other source of endless aggravation, Ryanair's passengers. Especially the ones wrecking his 
efforts to shave luggage-handling costs by checking in their cases (for an extra £30) because they are "too mentally 
bloody lazy to travel with carry-on bags".
Surely he doesn't seriously expect anyone to go on a three-week holiday with just a carry-on?
"Oh, for God's sake, of course you can for three weeks," he says.
"I can't."
"You can."
"I don't want to."
He stares at me, then admits his wife feels the same way.
"My wife goes away on holidays for a couple of weeks, and she wears bikinis and a few flips-flops, but she needs 
her 40 pairs of shoes," he says theatrically. "What do you need 40 pairs of shoes for?"
So, who exactly is the ideal Ryanair passenger? "Our ideal passenger is someone with a pulse and a credit card, 
who will follow the simple instructions to lower our costs to the maximum."
By this point, hunger is driving me to make a fresh attempt on the bagel wrapper. Off it comes, and there sits a sad-
looking bagel containing a pile of pesto, tomato and cucumber. I start picking at it. O'Leary's salad sits menacingly 
on his desk, untouched.
This is a typical lunch for him, he says, when he isn't at the gym.
What does he like to do in the gym?
"Look up and down a slim girl's rear," he says. "Sadly there's not that many of them. They're a bunch of old sweaty 
farts."
Though greying a little, O'Leary is, at 48, not that old. Before he became a loud-mouthed chief executive, he was a 
tax accountant, before that a businessman's son, expensively educated at some of Ireland's best schools. 
According to one newspaper's estimate he is worth more than £300m, partly thanks to a 4 per cent stake in 
Ryanair. But for years now, he has been saying he will retire "in two or three years". So what is it today?
"Three years," he says, suddenly trying to look serious. By then it will be time to "Tesco-ise Ryanair", by which he 
means time to ditch him for someone more suitable for a larger, more sedate operation.
"In certain respects I am our best salesman," he says, explaining the "pantomime villain character" he plays for the 
airline is done purely for the free publicity (the net spend on advertising last year was EUR5m, he says, not much 
for an airline Ryanair's size). "But I'm also negative in that a lot of my antics detract from the fact that Ryanair has 
the youngest fleet of aircraft, the best punctuality record, delivers a terrific customer service.
"I think you need me for the rapid growth and for the in-cost reduction initiatives, but once they're all done you then 
need to hand over to somebody who's a bit more respectful of politicians and bureaucrats, talks about caring about 
the environment and old people and f***ing jungles and fish in the sea and all that shite."
'It was either this or McDonald's ' Lunch with the FT: Michael O'Leary, the controversy-courting, cost-cutting 
chief executive of Ryanair , does not want to eat....
Goodness knows what O'Leary will do if he ever retires. He claims to have no interest in holidays. "I go to the 
Algarve with the family for two weeks, because I have to. And I can build the sandcastles with the children. You 
know, the sandcastle's fine for the first five minutes, and after that it's, 'Oh Jesus, will someone come and rescue 
me!' I'm praying for a crisis."
What about close friends? "My wife, occasionally. My children on a good day."
He hates the theatre. Only sees films when dragged by his wife, "just for marriage maintenance reasons". His main 
interests, apart from Ryanair, consist of farming, football and racehorses, of which he has a few including one called 
War of Attrition, which won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2006. I had always assumed this was an O'Leary-esque 
joke at a rival's expense - Aer Lingus, perhaps - but he says the animal had the name when he bought it.
There is a strange lack of sophistication about O'Leary. His success has made him one of the industry's most 
prominent airline chiefs, his name constantly on the lips of his peers, his business model aped around the world. 
Willie Walsh, a fellow Irishman and the chief executive of British Airways, once told me, only half-joking, that 
O'Leary's success had even driven other airline executives to copy his dress sense: "You get these CEOs who, 
because O'Leary doesn't wear a tie or a suit, feel that to have any sort of respect, you can't wear a tie."
Yet his world view has curious gaps. At one point, I ask him what he thinks of other well-known figures in his 
industry. Stelios? "A rich kid who got off his arse." Richard Branson? "A genius in the way he has made a fortune 
out of the Virgin brand, but he doesn't add up to much." But, when asked about Tony Tyler, chief executive at 
Cathay Pacific, one of Asia's biggest airlines, he looks blank. "Never heard of him," he says. "Anyone in the airline 
industry outside of Europe, I wouldn't know who the hell they are."
There is also something rather quaint about him. He doesn't have a BlackBerry, there is no computer on his desk. 
He even claims not to have an e-mail address. "E-mail is rubbish. If there's something important, I'll send a fax, or 
we'll speak."
Each day a team compiles two reports on paper for him, one for sales, one for punctuality, which give an instant 
overview of how the business is performing. He gets up and grabs a sheet showing the day's bookings, the month's 
sales, next month's sales, available seats, how it all compares with the same month last year, and so on. "Business 
should be simple," he beams.
Lack of e-mail does not stop him being an enthusiastic correspondent. When UK advertising standards authorities 
chided him for claiming Ryanair's flights were faster than the Eurostar train, he sent them a copy of Everyday Maths 
for Dummies . Journalists who write about him sometimes get an unsolicited, though frequently charming, missive. 
A colleague on the FT who wrote a column comparing Ryanair to Aeroflot received a two-page letter along with the 
latest "Girls of Ryanair" calendar, featuring bikini-clad photos of Miss Check-In and Miss Fuel Pump, a regular 
production that O'Leary insists uses only company cabin crew.
The admiration is reciprocated, at least in the financial media. On a cabinet in a corner of his office is a dusty 
collection of awards sent by the likes of Barron's, the financial magazine that has named him one of the "world's 
most respected CEOs" ever since it started handing out the award in 2005. "Barf!" says O'Leary, looking 
embarrassed, when asked about the prizes.
His constant obsession with cost-cutting, however, not to mention his foul mouth, has also spawned less adulatory 
attention, such as the website www.ihateryanair.co.uk, dedicated to what it calls "the world's most hated airline".
Before today, I say, every person I spoke to and said I was having lunch with Michael O'Leary reacted with horror or 
pity. Doesn't he find it wearying to be such a hate figure? "It would be wearying if you weren't growing by 9m 
passengers a year," he says. "We know, fundamentally, that we have huge public support."
Outside, the light is fading. My flight home is getting near. My bagel is still there, still half-eaten. O'Leary's salad still 
sits on his desk.

A few days later, I get a letter from O'Leary, thanking me for taking the time to come to Dublin to see him and 
hoping I enjoyed my "five-star gourmet lunch". By the way, he adds: "I forgot to charge you for the coffee, so you 
owe me one." Pilita Clark is FT aerospace correspondent

The permanent grounding of Scotland's Flyglobespan and more histrionics at British Airways have reignited 
speculation about the next airline likely to go kaput. The usual names are tossed around: Hungary's Wizz Air, 4/1 at 
Irish bookmaker Paddy Power, and Finnair at 9/2. By the bookie's reckoning, a narrow world view, admittedly, you 
have to go a long way down the field to find the first Asian carrier: Singapore Airlines, at 100/1. That's not far off silly 
season candidates Vatican Air at 500/1 ( occasional shuttles from Rome to Lourdes) and Air Force One at 1000/1.
The global industry is in a funk, brooding about an average return on equity of minus 42 per cent in the past 12 
months. But if there are pockets of exuberance, most of them are in the east. Among the largest listed airlines, the 
top seven share-price performers this year are Asian. By revenues, venerable flag carriers - Lufthansa, Air France- 
KLM and Delta - still dominate. But when it comes to profits, the five biggest non-Asian airlines by market 
capitalisation are forecast to lose a total $2.6bn this fiscal year. Asia's top five should earn $1.
Evenbn so, it is a familiar hard-luck story of high fuel and low yields. At the top end, Cathay Pacific and Singapore 
Airlines are pinning hopes on a lasting business rebound . In the middle, dependent on price-sensitive leisure travel, 
the likes of Malaysia Airlines and Thai Airways are struggling - the latter not helped by its chairman, who allegedly 
dodged excess baggage fees on 30 pieces of luggage, carrying mostly fruit. And yesterday AirAsia and Jetstar, two 
of Asia's largest budget carriers, said they were teaming up to shave costs. Even so, the contrast between regions 
is striking. When Ryanair accelerates plans to reduce capex and return cash to investors, you know things are 
bleak. The Irish enfant terrible is becoming what it has always derided: a grown-up company in a low-growth 
industry.

Budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC announced Friday it has broken off negotiations with Boeing Co. to buy 200 
more 737-800 short-haul aircraft after being unable to extract concessions from the manufacturer.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair had reached a pricing agreement for the aircraft to be 
delivered from 2013 to 2016 but Boeing was "unwilling to incorporate some other terms and conditions from our 
existing agreement into this new aircraft order."
O'Leary declined to specify what the points of disagreement were. He said Ryanair was willing to reopen 
negotiations next year, but stressed that Ryanair Europe's fastest-growing and most profitable airline would do a 
deal only if Boeing conceded to its demands.
"Instead we will focus our efforts on maintaining Ryanair's strong traffic and new route growth into 2010," O'Leary 
said. "We look forward to briefing shareholders in the first quarter of the New Year with a revised strategy which will 
comprise much reduced capital expenditures through 2011 and 2012."
Ryanair said it still plans to take delivery of 112 737-800s over the next three years.
Ryanair is one of Boeing's biggest customers and typically negotiates years in advance for large blocs of aircraft 
purchased at heavily discounted bulk prices.
The Chicago-based aircraft manufacturer said it was disappointed that Ryanair decided not to expand its fleet. It 
also kept the door open for resumed negotiations in 2010.
"We worked to find a solution that met Ryanair's needs and also made good business sense for Boeing," the 
statement said. "Ryanair remains a highly valued customer, today operating a fleet of over 200 737s, and we look 
forward to working with Ryanair on future fleet requirements."
Shares in Ryanair rose 5.8 percent to (EURO)3.28 ($4.72) after the announcement.

Ryanair has finally ended its fraught negotiations with Boeing for up to 200 more planes.
In an announcement this morning it said that, although price had been agreed, the negotiations had failed on terms 
and conditions for the purchases.
The airline has, however, appeared to leave the door open for more talks in the future that could revive the deal.
The negotiations have been going on for months, punctuated by flamboyant warnings from Ryanair chief executive 
Michael O'Leary that it would walk away if the terms were not right. O'Leary had also said the airline would abandon 
rapid expansion and use its profit instead to distribute dividends to shareholders. This morning's announcement 
has, however, a more sober tone. It says that because negotiations "cannot be successfully concluded prior to the 
end of the calendar year", the airline's board has "confirmed that its negotiations with Boeing have terminated 
unsuccessfully". The negotiations were for up to 200 new B737-800 series aircraft for delivery during the period 
2013-2016. Ryanair said it would still be taking delivery of 112 Boeing planes over the next three years "which will 
sustain Ryanair's strong traffic growth over the medium term". It added: "Ryanair will now bring forward plans to 
significantly reduce growth and capital expenditures, in order to maximise cash balances for distribution to 
shareholders during the period 2012-2015." Chief executive O'Leary said: "Boeing were unwilling to incorporate 
some other terms and conditions from our existing agreement into this new aircraft order . "Ryanair has made clear 
to Boeing that we will not order aircraft if we believe that either the pricing or the other contractual terms and 
conditions will be inferior to those which we currently enjoy, as this would not be a wise or sensible use of 
shareholders funds. "We have no plans to reopen discussions with Boeing or any other aircraft manufacturers. 
"Instead we will focus our efforts on maintaining Ryanair's strong traffic and new route growth into 2010 and we look 
forward to briefing shareholders in the first quarter of the New Year with a revised strategy which will comprise 
much reduced capital expenditures through 2011 and 2012, thereby generating substantial surplus cash balances 
for distribution during the period 2012-2015. "I believe it is appropriate to return these surplus funds to

shareholders, if we cannot use them to purchase aircraft on terms which enable us to meet our demanding return 
on capital targets." He adds: "Perhaps in future there may be other opportunities for Ryanair and Boeing to work 
together to our mutual benefit during the period from 2013 onwards."

Ryanair confirmed that the breakdown of these negotiations will not effect its plans to take delivery of 112 B737-800 
aircraft during the next 3 calendar years 2010 (48), 2011 (37) and 2012 (27), which will sustain Ryanair&apos;s 
strong traffic growth over the medium term.

prior to the end of the calendar year and accordingly Ryanair have confirmed that its negotiations with Boeing have 
terminated unsuccessfully.
Ryanair&apos;s CEO Michael O&apos;Leary said, "We regret that our prolonged negotiations with Boeing have 
failed to reach a mutually acceptable conclusion. While we reached agreement with Boeing on pricing for 200 
aircraft deliveries during the 2013-16 period, Boeing were unwilling to incorporate some other terms and conditions 
from our existing agreement into this new aircraft order. We have no plans to reopen discussions with Boeing or 
any other aircraft manufacturers."
Ryanair confirmed that the breakdown of these negotiations will not effect its plans to take delivery of 112 B737-800 
aircraft during the next 3 calendar years 2010 (48), 2011 (37) and 2012 (27), which will sustain Ryanair&apos;s 
strong traffic growth over the medium term.

(RTTNews) - Irish low-cost passenger airline Ryanair Holdings Plc. (RYAAY, RYA.L) confirmed Friday that it has 
unsuccessfully ended its negotiations with Boeing Co. (BA) to buy up to 200 new B737-800 series aircraft to be 
delivered in 2013-2016. The airline said it has no plans to reopen talks with Boeing or any other plane supplier.
In its quarterly meeting on Thursday, Ryanair board resolved that it could not successfully conclude the negotiations 
with Boeing before the end of the calendar year. The airline further said it would announce details of its revised 
business plan in the first quarter.
Michael O&apos;Leary, Ryanair&apos;s Chief Executive Officer said, "We regret that our prolonged negotiations 
with Boeing have failed to reach a mutually acceptable conclusion... Ryanair has made clear to Boeing that we will 
not order aircraft if we believe that either the pricing or the other contractual terms and conditions will be inferior to 
those which we currently enjoy, as this would not be a wise or sensible use of shareholders funds."
Ryanair, headquartered in Dublin Airport County Dublin, Ireland, noted that while it agreed with Boeing on pricing 
for the 200 aircraft, Boeing was against Ryanair&apos;s incorporating some other terms and conditions from 
existing agreement into the new aircraft order.
"Instead we will focus our efforts on maintaining Ryanair&apos;s strong traffic and new route growth into 2010 and 
we look forward to briefing shareholders in the first quarter of the New Year with a revised strategy which will 
comprise much reduced capital expenditures through 2011 and 2012, thereby generating substantial surplus cash 
balances for distribution during the period 2012-2015," added O&apos;Leary.
Ryanair finds it appropriate to return the surplus funds to shareholders, if the company could not use the funds to 
purchase aircraft on terms, which will satisfy its demanding return on capital targets.
Ryanair also specified that it will continue to work with its partners in Boeing on the 48 deliveries, which the 
company is scheduled to take in 2010.
".....perhaps in future there may be other opportunities for Ryanair and Boeing to work together to our mutual 
benefit during the period from 2013 onwards," concluded O&apos;Leary.
Ryanair Pulls Out Of Negotiations With Boeing To Buy Upto 200 Aircraft In B737-800 Series - Update
Earlier this month, Ryanair had reported that its November passengers traffic increased 15% to 4.96 million from 
4.32 million in the year-ago period. Load factor for the month rose 1% to 80% from 79% in the same period last 
year.
RYA.L is currently trading at 3.27 pence, up 0.16 pence or 5.32%, on a volume of 10.86 million shares. In the past 
52-week period, the shares have been trading in a broad range of 3.07 pence-387.5 pence on the LSE.
BA closed Thursday&apos;s regular trading at $54.47 on the NYSE.

BA 's reprieve offers only a short lull in travel chaos
BA's reprieve offers only a short lull in travel chaos

Christmas: season of mince pies, goodwill to all men - and travel chaos. British Airways crew called for a strike 
(now aborted) when several of the windows on the advent calendar were already open. Heathrow baggage 
handlers and Eurostar train drivers issued similar threats yesterday . Scotland's Globespan carrier trumped them all 
by going belly up . Driving home for Christmas may be the only way of getting there.
Rival carriers, rubbing their hands, think otherwise. Virgin Atlantic was quick to put bigger planes on to popular 
routes to scoop up disgruntled and potentially stranded BA passengers. It sold 3,000 seats in the space of 12 hours 
on Wednesday morning. Globespan had barely knocked on the administrator's door before EasyJet and Ryanair 
were brandishing rescue fares . In an industry that has failed to match supply with demand, any sign of capacity 
disappearing is cause for cheer. Airlines were similarly quick to pounce when XL Airways went bust last year, and 
Oasis Hong Kong , a long-haul discount operator, a few months earlier.
This is no fast buck; the idea is to woo long-term business. It is difficult to say it works. XL flew an annual 2.3m 
passengers but the year after it collapsed, airlines are set to lose a recession-induced net $11.bn Next year, the 
International Air Transport Association forecasts the industry will lose a combined $5.6bn - but look, already they 
are back, increasing fleets i n a way that suggests demand is hotting up. Flag carriers are national champions. Few 
governments dare let them collapse. Yesterday's court decision to block the strike at BA is little more than a sticking 
plaster over a festering wound, but even so the airline will probably soldier on. Globally, big fixed costs are growing 
and efforts to cut the variable ones mean more chaos. To one and all, passengers and shareholders, happy 
holidays.

Stricken Scottish carrier's £30m in question
Stricken Scottish carrier's £30m in question

Body
Administrators of Globe-span, the collapsed Scottish airline that has left thousands of passengers stranded abroad, 
were investigating last night why £30m of its funds were being held by E-Clear, the company that handles its credit 
card transactions.
Bruce Cartwright, of PwC, said he understood that about half that amount might be recoverable for creditors of the 
Edinburgh-based group, which was put into administration on Wednesday night.
Mr Cartwright declined to say whether the amount being held by E-Clear contributed to the airline's collapse, and 
said his immediate priority was getting people home. E-Clear was not available to comment.
About 1,100 passengers who were abroad on packages with the company's tour operator division are protected by 
the Air Travel Organisers Licensing scheme, run by the Civil Aviation Authority, and will be brought home under its 
auspices.
But 3,400 passengers who had only flights with the airline will have to make their own way home, though Mr 
Cartwright said competitor companies were offering low "rescue" fares.
Ryanair, EasyJet, Virgin Atlantic, BMIbaby and Flybe were among airlines helping out with flights for holidaymakers 
stranded in Spain, Portugal, Cyprus and Egypt.
The administrators made 550 Globespan employees redundant yesterday. Brian Boyd, the Unite union's national 
officer for civil aviation, said it was tragic that Globespan had been unable to survive the current difficult trading 
conditions.
"However, the real tragedy is that, along with thousands of passengers stuck overseas, the Globespan employees 
have been thrown into a Christmas of misery with no wages and no job," he said.
An estimated 27,000 people have future flights booked with Globespan through the Atol insurance scheme, while a 
further 90,000 are thought to have forward bookings without Atol protection. Those who used credit cards should be 
able to reclaim, but those who used debit cards will probably have to rely on travel -insurance.
Stricken Scottish carrier's £30m in question
Rochelle Turner, from Which? Holiday, said: "With yet another airline collapsing leaving thousands of Britons 
stranded either overseas or with future flights that they cannot take, it's really important that people take steps to 
ensure they are protected, should a similar incident occur in the future."
The collapsed airline also had a Ministry of Defence contract to operate flights in and out of the Falklands. Air Italy 
will operate these flights in the short term.

Ryanair today announced that is is taking over a range of routes that were served by the collapsed Scottish airline 
Flyglobespan.
It is to base an extra aircraft in Prestwick to serve routes formerly offered by Flyglobespan to Alicante, Faro, 
Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, Malaga, Palma and Tenerife, it said.
It will also open a new routes to Fuerteventura from March next.
It says the new aircraft - Ryanair's sixth in Prestwick - will deliver 2m passengers a year and 300 new direct jobs. It 
will also add an extra aircraft to its base in Bournemouth to open four new routes to Fuerteventura, Ibiza, Malta and 
Valencia from late March 2010. This brings Ryanair's investment in Bournemouth to two aircraft worth over 
USD140million. The four new routes along with increased frequencies on three other routes to Alicante, Malaga and 
Palma will increase Ryanair's annual traffic at Bournemouth to 650,000 a year, which will sustain 650 local jobs, the 
airline claimed.

News that Ireland - at least technically - lifted out of recession in the third quarter failed to boost the ISEQ with both 
CRH and the banks falling sharply.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 23.77 points to 2,892.11.
Ireland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) edged slightly higher in the third quarter compared to the previous three 
months but Gross National Product (GNP) stayed negative, the latest Quarterly National Accounts from the CSO 
show. The Accounts are ambiguous in determining whether or not Ireland's economy grew or shrunk. Initial 
estimates of GDP and GNP, on a seasonally adjusted basis, for the third quarter of 2009 show a decline of 1.4pc in 
GNP and a small increase of 0.3pc in GDP compared with the previous quarter. GDP is the most common 
international method of calculating economic growth or decline, while the ESRI in Ireland prefers to emphasise 
GNP. The latter measure takes GDP and removes the value of multinational company profits that are siphoned out 
of the country and make no difference to how rich or poor we really are. This means that, technically, Ireland lifted 
out of recession on an international basis but our wealth as measured by purely domestic metrics languished in 
recession.
Banks were hard hit with AIB down 3c to E1.17, Bank of Ireland fell by 5c to E1.24 and Irish Life and Permanent 
declined by 3c to E3.14. ILP is holding its EGM today. As a result of the current challenging environment for the 
banking sector in Ireland, and the significant changes taking place, including the various government support 
schemes, the directors are keen 'to maintain maximum flexibility in the group's corporate structure going forward'. 
CRH broke its near-week long rally on the back of potential major gains in its key US market from a jobs stimulus 
from the Obama government with investors this morning taking profits. Shares in the group fell by 10c to E18.35. 
Siteserv has delivered what analysts are calling a robust set of results for the six months ended October 2009 
which were well ahead of Davy's forecasts. The group reported a pre-tax profit of E2.3m on revenues of E81.7m. 
ISEQ gets no lift from economy news; ISEQ Down
"We had forecast a small pre-tax loss of E509,000 on revenues of E78.5m." Net debt continues to be managed 
lower and at period-end had fallen to E144.5m (end-April: E149.5m). Its shares were flat at E0.07. Ryanair has 
announced two new bases - its thirty-eighth and thirty-ninth - both on the Iberian Peninsula. Malaga becomes its 
fifth Spanish base with four aircraft and 39 routes, and Faro becomes its second Portuguese base with three aircraft 
and 28 routes. Ryanair also announced the switching of Alicante and Faro routes from Shannon to Kerry and Knock 
due to airport costs. Shannon airport will be reduced to just one based aircraft from end-March 2010. Ryanair 
shares fell 5c to E3.07.

lower and at period-end had fallen to E144.5m (end-April: E149.5m). Its shares were flat at E0.07. Ryanair has 
announced two new bases - its thirty-eighth and thirty-ninth - both on the Iberian Peninsula. Malaga becomes its 
fifth Spanish base with four aircraft and 39 routes, and Faro becomes its second Portuguese base with three aircraft 
and 28 routes. Ryanair also announced the switching of Alicante and Faro routes from Shannon to Kerry and Knock 
due to airport costs. Shannon airport will be reduced to just one based aircraft from end-March 2010. Ryanair 
shares fell 5c to E3.07.

Flyglobespan, the largest airline in Scotland, has collapsed into administration.
All of its scheduled flights from Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen -- as well as transatlantic flights from other UK 
hubs -- have been cancelled.
According to administrators PwC, the UK Civil Aviation Authority will be responsible for repatriating the more than 
1,000 people on package holidays booked with the group.
The majority of its 800 staff have been made redundant. The Edinburgh-based company had been hoping to obtain 
a funding package from external investors, and earlier this week had expressed confidence that the deal would be 
closed. But Globespan says that administrators have been appointed to both the tour operator and its ground-
handling operation Alba. It is blaming "liquidity issues" for the decision, adding that the administrators have been 
"unable to continue trading the companies". "All flights have been cancelled and will not be rescheduled," it says. 
The aircraft fleet has been grounded. Budget carriers Ryanair and EasyJet have already stepped in to offer special 
fares to stranded passengers. The Civil Aviation Authority states that passengers who booked flights through the 
tour operator, Globespan, will be protected by its Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (ATOL) scheme. But it adds that 
passengers who purchased flight-only tickets directly from the airline, Flyglobespan, are not covered. Globespan 
Group says: "Flyglobespan passengers already abroad will need to make their own arrangements to return to the 
UK using alternative airlines." Flyglobespan, launched in 2003, operated to holiday destinations in North America, 
Egypt and Europe using a fleet of Boeing 767s and 737s. It also provided capacity to the UK Ministry of Defence.

Body
No-frills airline, Ryanair, today announced a new twice weekly service from Ireland West Knock to the hugely 
popular holiday destination - Faro in the Algarve, Portugal.
The move is being seen as part of the airline's move to pressure the operators of Shannon Airport.
Ryanair also announced that it is transferring its Alicante route from Shannon to Kerry.
Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary has blamed high costs at Shannon compared to lower costs at the two other 
regional airports. It says the move will mean that the number of aircraft based at Shannon will be reduced from four 
to one by next March. It predicts that Shannon will suffer steep traffic declines in 2010 because its charges are 
uncompetitive. The new route from Knock, which is due to begin flights at the end of March next is the second 
scheduled European service from Ireland West Airport Knock following the introduction of the twice weekly service 
to Alicante which began last June and will re-start again in March. The airline already has daily scheduled services 
to Liverpool, London Luton and London Stansted airports in addition to the four-times-a-week services to East 
Midlands and Bristol, their twice weekly summer service to Alicante and the recently announced three-times-a-week 
service to Leeds Bradford which starts on March 25th 2010. Welcoming today's announcement, Joe Gilmore, 
Managing Director, Ireland West Airport Knock said: "The addition of this European service from Ireland West 
Knock is another significant step in the Airport's development as we expand our schedule services to now include a 
second popular European sun destination. Ryanairs continued growth from Ireland West Knock is further good 
news for passengers and we are sure this new Faro service will prove hugely popular with holidaymakers in the 
West, North West and Midlands regions of Ireland. Despite the recession, Ireland West Knock continues to attract 
new destinations and this latest round of expansion from Ryanair underlines the airline's continued confidence in 
Ireland West Airport Knock. This new service will come as welcomed news to many holiday makers who will now

have more flexibility when booking their holidays to self package or to go on shorter breaks to Portugal direct from

Complex web of agreements lies at the heart of BA strike
Complex web of agreements lies at the heart of BA strike

Highlight: News analysis
The airline faces higher costs than its younger rivals for its workplace contracts, writes Pilita Clark
Body
When heavy snow in London forced British Airways to divert dozens of international flights bound for Heathrow to 
cities around Europe earlier this year, the airline was all too well aware that some aircraft could be grounded for 
days - wherever they happened to land.
The reason? The so-called disruption agreements BA has with its cabin crew that allow staff to stay for up to two 
nights in places to which they are redirected at such times.
A complex - and costly - web of workplace agreements such as these lie at the heart of the 12-day strike threatened 
by BA's 13,500 cabin crew from December 22.
Built up over years, they explain why it is so hard for BA to make changes such as the crew reductions that are key 
to the latest bout of industrial unrest.
They are also part of the reason older, formerly state-owned airlines such as BA have higher costs than their 
younger rivals, such as EasyJet or Ryanair, making them uncompetitive in some areas. When EasyJet faces such 
diversions, for example, it follows EU or UK regulations governing how long crew must rest between flights. 
However, it has no agreement with staff compelling it to allow stays of up to two nights, with all the extra logistical 
problems entailed in getting aircraft back and passengers to scheduled destinations.
At BA, managers have to call cabin crew representatives to ask if they can have an "alleviation", allowing crew to fly 
within a shorter period than two nights. This is often granted, according to industry figures with experience of the 
system, but not always.
In one case earlier this year, BA staff declined to crew a flight after one night's rest in Scotland, forcing BA to put 
stranded passengers onto alternative flights, while the pilots flew the original aircraft - empty - back to Heathrow. 
Pilots are covered by a separate set of work agreements.
Complex web of agreements lies at the heart of BA strike
"It is incredibly archaic," says John Strickland, an aviation consultant. He adds that the pressures on BA to change 
such agreements have grown in recent years as the airline faces ever-greater competition.
"Twenty years ago, BA had a much more benign environment," Mr Strickland says. "There wasn't the impetus in 
those days to focus on those tough industrial relations issues. You could get by with squeezing extra margins from 
premium seats and make a profit despite yourself."
Last year, however, BA made a pre-tax loss of £401m as the global recession saw its premium travellers in first or 
business class shift into economy or stop flying altogether. Willie Walsh, BA's chief executive, fears some of them 
will never return, making it imperative to pare back costs permanently.
Higher staff salaries are only one reason BA's costs exceed those of its rivals.
Its reliance on business travellers means a large proportion of its tickets are sold through travel agents rather than 
via its own website - a cheaper option favoured by rivals such as EasyJet and Ryanair.
In addition, both those no-frills airlines took advantage of the aviation downturn after the September 11 terrorist 
attacks in the US to make large orders at lower-than-normal prices for new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus 
respectively.
Not only were these new aircraft more fuel efficient and cheaper to maintain than BA's older fleet, their low prices 
gave each airline an additional fixed cost advantage over its more established rival.
Finally, BA cannot al-ways use its aircraft each day as much as its rivals. Its business class cabins mean it has 
fewer seats to sell than a low-cost rival with just one class. It also has to schedule many flights to make connections 
at its Heathrow hub. Ryan-air and EasyJet fly "point-to-point" to destinations, and so can use the same aircraft for 
more flights each day.

Aer Lingus chief warns unions of Ryanair threat
Aer Lingus chief warns unions of Ryanair threat

Body
Aer Lingus' new chief executive has warned labor unions that the Irish airline faces a likely takeover by cut-throat 
rival Ryanair unless they agree to a new round of job, salary and benefit cuts.
In an interview published Wednesday in the British newspaper Financial Times, chief executive Christoph Mueller 
was quoted as saying that Aer Lingus could not survive as an independent airline if it doesn't slash costs quickly.
Ryanair already is Aer Lingus' biggest shareholder with a 30 percent stake, has launched two thwarted takeover 
bids in 2006 and 2008, and could mount a renewed challenge in 2010. Ryanair refuses to recognize unions and 
has labor costs dramatically lower than its main Irish competitor.
Mueller, a former German charter-airline executive to who took charge of Aer Lingus in September, is confronting 
unions with a demand for nearly (EURO)100 million ($150 million) in cuts to labor costs. He says progress has been 
made in talks with cabin crews and ground staff, but the pilots are holding out on protecting their pay and benefits, 
particularly work schedules.
He told the Financial Times that each day which passes without a labor agreement increases the prospect of a 
surrender to Ryanair, which could offer investors a credible case for restoring Aer Lingus to profits.
"If Aer Lingus isn't capable of mastering its own destiny, then of course the likelihood that some form of non-
independence might occur is more likely," Mueller was quoted as saying.
Asked if this meant a takeover by Ryanair, Mueller replied, "Yes."
Mueller was quoted as saying that the pilots union "is resisting and bringing Aer Lingus closer to a situation where 
we might lose our independence."
Dublin-based Ryanair which has thrived amid the European recession with its aggressive marketing and low base 
fares says it will mount another takeover bid only if the Irish government, which owns 25 percent of Aer Lingus 
shares, approaches it for a deal.
Aer Lingus chief warns unions of Ryanair threat
The government and European Union regulators previously have rejected a Ryanair-Aer Lingus merger on the 
grounds this would create an Irish monopoly for short-haul European air travel.
Ryanair shares rose 4 percent to (EURO)3.09 ($4.57) in early Dublin trade Wednesday, while Aer Lingus was 2 
percent higher at (EURO)0.58 ($0.86).

The new head of Aer Lingus has warned that the Irish airline risks being taken over by its larger rival Ryanair unless 
employees agree to his plans for sweeping cost cuts.
"If Aer Lingus isn't capable of mastering its own destiny, then of course the likelihood that some form of non-
independence might occur is more likely," Christoph Mueller told the Financial Times yesterday.
Asked if this meant a take-over by Ryanair , Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, which has made two thwarted bids 
for Aer Lingus, Mr Mueller said: "Yes."
Under Irish takeover rules, Ryanair can make a third bid from late January.
"I believe there is a correlation between our ability to have an agreement with the unions and the likelihood of a 
bid," Mr Mueller said. Ryanair holds just over 29 per cent of Aer Lingus. The Irish flag carrier's staff own 15 per cent 
of its shares.
Mr Mueller, formerly of the TUI travel group and Germany's Lufthansa, has been Aer Lingus chief executive since 
September. He has made progress with cabin crew and ground staff in talks on a EUR97m cost-saving plan 
involving job and pay cuts, but is still negotiating with pilots.
"I know that it is the desire of all our employees to stay independent and that is the reason I feel obliged to do 
everything I possibly can to reach an agreement with the unions," said Mr Mueller. "One group of employees is 
resisting and bringing Aer Lingus closer to a situation where we might lose our independence."
Aer Lingus reported a pre-tax loss of EUR119.7m for the year to December 31 and analysts say a failure to cut 
costs could   jeopardise its independence.
"If there is a failure in the negotiations it leaves Aer Lingus much more vulnerable," said Joe Gill of Bloxham 
stockbrokers in Dublin.
Aer Lingus head warns of Ryanair takeover threat
"If talks collapse you are back to looking at a business model that is fundamentally impaired. That will be reflected 
in the share price, so it's easier for Ryanair to say they can come in and do a better job."
Ryanair first bid EUR2.80 a share for Aer Lingus in October 2006, valuing the company at EUR1.48bn. That 
takeover was blocked by the European Commission on competition grounds.
A second bid worth half that of the first in December last year also failed after the Irish government, which has a 25 
per cent stake in Aer Lingus, said it undervalued the airline.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, told the Financial Times recently Ryanair was "highly unlikely" to make 
a third offer for Aer Lingus, but added: "I think the government and unions will come here to us and ask us to help 
restructure Aer Lingus in a sensible way, probably ask us to manage it."

in European flights out of Dublin.
A second bid worth half that of the first in December last year also failed after the Irish government, which has a 25 
per cent stake in Aer Lingus, said it undervalued the airline and would hurt competition.
Ryanair still has just over 29 per cent of Aer Lingus and staff have 15 per cent.
Aer Lingus has a fleet of 44 aircraft flying to 70 destinations in Europe and North America.
Ryanair has 200 aircraft flying to 150 destinations in Europe.

Talks between Aer Lingus pilots and the airline's management geared have ended without agreement, according to 
the pilots' union, IALPA.
The union said that Aer Lingus rejected a cost reduction package proposed by the pilots which would have 
amounted to E33m a year. It says this involved pay cuts, pay freezes and a substantial reduction in pilot numbers of 
12-15pc.
Late last week, Aer Lingus said it had set up a taskforce to start planning reductions in its fleet and compulsory 
redundancies.
This morning, the Financial Times carried an interview with Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph Mueller, in which

Ryanair is unlikely to reach a deal with Boeing on new aircraft orders because the U.S. plane maker wants to 
change the delivery conditions, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has said.
"We've now pretty much reached agreement with Boeing on price, but the deal is unlikely to take place because 
now they want to go back and change delivery conditions," O'Leary told Reuters in an interview.
"Unless they change their position over the next week, the deal is off," he said.

Shares in the main Dublin index fell sharply across the board this morning as investors took profits from Friday's 
rally on the back of improving conditions for the US economy.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 53.31 points to 2,933.93.
Share prices were mostly down across Europe from a two-week closing high the previous session, with UK lenders 
pressured by the possibility of a tax on bankers' bonuses. London's FTSE was 0.4pc lower at 5,301, the CAC in 
Paris was down 0.1pc to 3,842 and Frankfurt's DAX fell 0.3pc to 5,799. Banks were among the top losers. A UK 
government source told Reuters on Friday a windfall tax on banks was one revenue-raising option being considered 
by British chancellor Alistair Darling for his pre-budget report on Wednesday. HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds and Royal 
Bank of Scotland all fell between 1.3pc and 2.3pc.
Back home, shares in the banks fell with AIB down 3c to E1.53, Bank of Ireland dropped by 4c to E1.61 and Irish 
Life and Permanent was unmoved at E3.80. The stocks fell after the latest survey from KBC Bank Ireland and the 
Independent Mortgage Advisers Federation suggests that Irish house prices have fallen by around 36pc on 
average. This compares with the average decline of 26.6pc, according to the permanent tsb/ESRI House Price 
Index for October. Elsewhere, shares in Aer Lingus edged down 1c to E0.56 after it reported that the number of 
passengers on its long-haul flights last month was 25pc lower than in the same month last year. However, the 
airline added that its overall passenger numbers were up by nearly 5pc on the same month last year. Aer Lingus' 
total passenger numbers in November 2009 were 776,000, an increase of 4.7pc compared to November 2008. 
Ryanair's shares dropped 4c to E3.03. Ryanair has underperformed in 2009 principally on the back of unit revenue 
concerns and uncertainty regarding the level of growth in the business. In addition, it faces tougher fuel 
comparables into 2010. Davy Research said it should know before year-end the success or otherwise of the Boeing 
negotiations for around 200 (100 orders, 100 options) aircraft for delivery in 2013-2016. "However, we think the key

point is that the airline is moving quickly to more sustainable, modest growth rates - demonstrating a step change in 
its development - and is likely to benefit from a recovery in unit revenue and, most importantly, cash flow. The 
potential for an upturn in margins and ultimately returns and cash flows into 2011 is material." Independent News 
and Media shares edged up 1c to E0.10 after it said that it made a total of E150m from a series of asset disposals 
this year including the latest, Verivox Holdings in Germany, which it sold for E17m. INM said it has sold its 49pc 
interest in Verivox Holdings Ltd, a German online price comparator for energy and telecom services, for E16 million 
net to VVX Investments Ltd, an Oakley Capital Private Equity LP unit. An additional E1 million will be payable in 
2010 if Verivox reaches core profit targets in the current year. The completion of the disposal of Verivox, together 
with that of INM Outdoor which is expected to occur this month, will bring the total raised from disposals by the 
company this year to approximately E150 million, reaching the target set out earlier this year from selling non-core 
assets to reduce debt. Elan was the biggest faller with stocks down 24c to E4.22 despite news that it has submitted 
a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the EU's authorities for a schizophrenia treatment that uses the Irish 
firm's NanoCrystal technology. The application is for paliperidone palmitate, a once-monthly injection treatment for 
schizophrenia. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared the drug earlier this year, Elan said in a statement.

regarding the level of growth in the business. In addition, it faces tougher fuel comparables into 2010. Davy 
Research said it should know before year-end the success or otherwise of the Boeing negotiations for around 200 
(100 orders, 100 options) aircraft for delivery in 2013-2016. "However, we think the key point is that the airline is 
moving quickly to more sustainable, modest growth rates - demonstrating a step change in its development - and is 
likely to benefit from a recovery in unit revenue and, most importantly, cash flow. The potential for an upturn in 
margins and ultimately returns and cash flows into 2011 is material." Independent News and Media shares edged 
up 1c to E0.10 after it said that it made a total of E150m from a series of asset disposals this year including the 
latest, Verivox Holdings in Germany, which it sold for E17m. INM said it has sold its 49pc interest in Verivox 
ISEQ lower in line with world markets ISEQ Falls
Holdings Ltd, a German online price comparator for energy and telecom services, for E16 million net to VVX 
Investments Ltd, an Oakley Capital Private Equity LP unit. An additional E1 million will be payable in 2010 if Verivox 
reaches core profit targets in the current year. The completion of the disposal of Verivox, together with that of INM 
Outdoor which is expected to occur this month, will bring the total raised from disposals by the company this year to 
approximately E150 million, reaching the target set out earlier this year from selling non-core assets to reduce debt. 
Elan was the biggest faller with stocks down 10c to E4.35 despite news that it has submitted a Marketing 
Authorisation Application (MAA) to the EU's authorities for a schizophrenia treatment that uses the Irish firm's 
NanoCrystal technology. The application is for paliperidone palmitate, a once-monthly injection treatment for 
schizophrenia. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared the drug earlier this year, Elan said in a statement. 
Janssen-Cilag is a subsidiary of US biotech giant, Johnson and Johnson.

Irish shares fell back in early trade this morning, as profit taking set in after the strong gains of Friday.
All three banks were among the losers in Dublin this morning, following a trend across Europe.
The ISEQ index was 41.40 points lower a short time ago at 2,945.84.
Last Friday's gains came after US figures showed far fewer jobs being lost than expected, news that boosted 
optimism about the economic recovery. Shares surged in value, leading in turn to profit taking this morning. AIB 
was down 1c this morning to 155, with Bank of Ireland off by 3c to 161 and Irish Life and Permanent dropping 8c to 
372. Away from the financials, CRH was down 52c at 1788, with DCC sheddding 34c to 1846 and Elan slipping by 
15c to 429. Ryanair was 5c lower at 302.

Shannon Airport today said that no deal has been reached between it and Ryanair on the no-frills airline's presence 
because of what the airport operator called Ryanair's "unreasonable demands".
Ryanair had offered to provide Shannon Airport a reduced traffic target of only 600,000 annual passengers - as 
compared to the previously agreed throughput of two million passengers per year - and wanted to pay a minimal 
passenger charge. This offer was rejected on the basis that it did not make commercial sense for Shannon Airport.
"The airport would require the payment of fully commercial charges for such a low level of passenger traffic, and 
therefore it could not accede to the unreasonable demands of Ryanair for the continuation of some routes at a 
minimal level of charge." Said Martin Moroney, Director, Shannon Airport.
He said he is pleased that Ryanair has pledged to continue the operation of eight routes from Shannon with its 
remaining based aircraft, including important connections to airports such as Stansted, Gatwick, Paris Beauvais 
and Malaga. "We wish to see Ryanair continue serving Shannon in the future but it has to be on a basis that is 
commercially viable for both Shannon Airport and for Ryanair," he added. "Shannon, like all airports globally, is 
operating in an extremely challenging environment and simply cannot undertake non-commercially viable 
arrangements with airline partners." Shannon Airport continues to examine other options for serving additional UK 
and European destinations. "We are currently in positive ongoing communication with existing and potential new 
airline partners with a view to providing as many services as possible for the public from Shannon. We remain open 
to proposals from any airlines, including Ryanair, that are mutually beneficial," Mr Moroney said.

EasyJet November Load Factor, Traffic Increase - Update

Body
(RTTNews) - Low-cost airliner easyJet PLC (EZJ.L, EJETF.PK) Friday reported an increase in load factor and 
passengers carried for the month of November. While load factor rose 0.9 percentage points in November, traffic 
increased 12.2% from the previous year.
In November, the UK-based company's load factor, a measure of number of passengers as a proportion of the 
number of seats available for passengers, rose to 84.8% from 83.9% reported in November 2008.
Passengers, representing the number of earned seats flown, in November 2009 increased 12.2% to 3.35 million 
from 2.99 million in the prior year. The company noted that earned seats include seats that are flown whether or not 
the passenger turns up, as easyJet is a no-refund airline, and include seats provided for promotional purposes and 
to staff for business travel.
Among peers, Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) said Thursday that its November passengers traffic increased 
15% to 4.96 million from 4.32 million in the year-ago period. Load factor for the month rose to 80% from 79% in the 
prior year period.
easyJet last month reported an increase in traffic and load factor for October 2009. The company's load factor for 
October was 86.8%, up 3 percentage points from 83.9% in the prior year. The number of passengers increased 
6.6% in October to 4.22 million from 3.96 million in the previous-year month.
The improvements seen in the past two months are probably indicative of the beginning of a recovery in the 
struggling travel industry, at least in terms of budget travel.
The International Air Transport Association said Monday that international scheduled traffic results for October 
showed improving conditions. Passenger demand was up 0.5% compared to October 2008, while demand for 
international cargo rose to 0.5% below previous year levels, IATA said. Load factors for passenger and cargo 
continue at pre-recession levels of 78.0% and 54.1%, respectively, it added.
For the 12-month period ending November 2009, easyJet's load factor improved 1.4 percentage points to 85.8% 
from 84.4%. Passengers carried increased 3.2% to 45.79 million from last year's 44.37 million.
Last month, the company reported a decline in profit for fiscal 2010, despite an increase in revenues, hurt by higher 
fuel costs, lower interest income and exchange rate impact. The company said at that time that it sees a tough 
winter ahead. The company's full-year 2009 net profit dropped to GBP 71.2 million from GBP 83.2 million a year

ago. Earnings per share were 16.6 pence, down from last year's 19.4 pence. Profit before taxation dropped 50.4% 
to GBP 54.7 million from GBP 110.2 million in the previous year. Revenues increased to GBP 2.67 billion from GBP 
2.36 billion in the prior year.
EZJ.L closed Thursday's regular trade at 380.20 pence, up 2.60 pence or 0.69%, on 1.48 million shares.

Aer Lingus to cut jobs as union talks fail

Staff refuse to back cost-savings plan
Pilots want extra stake in airline
Body
Aer Lingusis to extend its compulsory redundancy programme after talks with trade unions on its rescue plan broke 
down.
Despite the intervention of the Labour Relations Council, a government-run arbitration body, the company could not 
get the backing of pilots and cabin crew for its EUR97m (£87m) cost-saving plan.
Aer Lingus indicated that only temporary savings over a few years were offered by the Irish Airline Pilots 
Association, rather than the structural adjustments that management was seeking.
Christoph Mueller, chief executive, said he "wanted to prove that a unionised airline, Aer Lingus, could be turned 
around in Ireland".
He insisted that the company would prefer to achieve cost savings through agreement with its employees.
But the airline said it would now proceed to reduce fleet capacity, eliminate lossmaking routes and make 
redundancies beyond the 676 job cuts envisaged in the original plan in October.
Local newspapers suggested that the company was now looking for more than 1,000 redundancies.
The board will meet again tomorrow to discuss the scale of the cuts.
Joe Gill, analyst with Bloxham stockbrokers, said the airline would sell or redeem the leases on two of its six long-
haul and five of its 33 short-haul aircraft. He said the figure of 1,000 job cuts had taken the markets by surprise. 
"But I expect the unions will kick back very hard now."
Aer Lingus to cut jobs as union talks fail
Mr Mueller said that when talks broke down on Monday the two sides had "narrowed the gap" and were "very close 
to signature".
But he made clear that IALPA had offered only "temporary savings" while "Aer Lingus was asked for very high 
compensation in return".
It is understood that the pilots, who already own 4.5 per cent of the company, sought a further 4 per cent stake in 
return for agreeing to the management restructuring plan.
Christina Carey, assistant general secretary of Impact, which represents both pilots and cabin crew, said "it would 
wrong to describe yesterday as a breakdown".
On the pilots' stake she said: "If pilots or anyone else is investing in the airline, by contributing money in terms of 
pay cuts or productivity, I think there should be recognition for that investment."
She said that cabin crew had met the savings targets set by the company, which was independently verified by 
Grant Thornton. She said cabin crew "had always delivered on their word" and had given EUR15m last year in 
"hard cash and productivity and we're prepared to contribute again".
Aer Lingus was privatised in 2006. Since then Ryanair, which has built up a 29.8 per cent stake, has launched two 
unsuccessful takeover bids. The Irish government retains a 25 per cent stake.
The shares closed up 3 per cent at 55 cents.

(ANSA) - DECEMBER 2 - Alitalia against RyanAir: Alitalia  CEO Rocco Sabelli, citing figures from  AEA, the 
Association of  European Airlines, indicated that the 2009 balance sheet ending  on 31 March shows that the major 
low cost company posted  operational profits amounting to 92 million and stated  contributions amounting to 190 
million.
During a meeting on air transportation set up by CGIL,  Sabelli stated that ''We do not have news of unreported  
contributions  . Alitalia s CEO emphasised the   very steep  competitive asymmetry   resulting from such a system. 
Without  prejudice to the fact that   all companies have the need to  redefine their business models''.
But Sabelli also leashed out against his direct competitor on  the Rome/Milan route, the High Speed Train.   
Nowhere in Italy  do airports and trains cross over. There is no place in Italy  where an airport sits next to a High 
Speed Train''. In other  words, according to the Alitalia CEO Italy is lacking a suitable  train service and that is part 
of the reason why low cost  companies are successful in catching such traffic demands.

Body
Negotiations between Ryanair and Boeing for an order of up to 200 Boeing 737-800s have ended, Ryanair says. 
Instead Ryanair plans to significantly reduce the airline's growth and increase capital expenditures in order to 
distribute a dividend to shareholders.
&
Ryanair's chief executive officer Michael O'Leary says that the companies reached an agreement on the pricing for 
the 200 aircraft, but that Boeing was unwilling to agree on other terms and conditions.
&
"Ryan air has made it clear to Boeing that we will not order aircraft if we believe that either the pricing or the other 
contractual terms and conditions will be inferior to those which we currently enjoy, as this would not be a wise or 
sensible use of shareholders funds," O'Leary says. "We have no plans to reopen discussions with Boeing or any 
other aircraft manufacturers."
&
Instead, Ryanair says it will focus on maintaining its strong traffic and new route growth in 2010, as well as reduce 
expenditures through 2012 and increase cash balances to distribute a dividend.
&
Ryanair will still take delivery of 112 737-800s between 2010 and 2012 in order to sustain the airline's traffic growth 
through the medium term. In 2010 the low-cost carrier will take 48 aircraft deliveries, in 2011 37 aircraft and in 2012 
27 aircraft.&

Highlight: DVB Bank has been in the market for decades. Sophie Segal speaks to Bertrand Grabowski, a member 
of the board of managing directors, about the bankâ(EURO)(TM)s aviation strategy and the kinds of clients it is 
looking for.
Body
Very few banks can boast $2 billion in commercial loans for 2009, but that is the amount of aircraft that DVB Bank 
will have financed by the end of this year. After a record year in 2008, DVB's aviation portfolio will increase by 5% in 
2009.
DVB, the transportation bank incorporated in Germany, has been in the aircraft lending business for more than 10 
years. Though many group it with the German Landesbanks, it is no such thing. In fact, DVB has tried to shake its 
image as a German bank. Wanting to be recognized as a global transportation merchant bank, DVB changed its 
name in October 2008, from DVB Bank AG (Aktiengesellschaft) to DVB Bank SE (Societas Europaea). 
With 58 employees in aviation, the bank continues to expand. While DVB started investing in aircraft in 2001, it 
hired an asset management team to manage and remarket leased aircraft in 2007. DVB also recently bought Total 
Engine Support, a UK company that specializes in engine management. Most recently, DVB linked up with National 
Bank of Abu Dhabi in setting up a $1 billion aviation fund. 
Most attractive deal 
Margins are important to DVB. &(EURO)oeThe average margin of our 2009 loans is above 350 basis points, and 
we intend to stay at this benchmark or above,&(EURO) says Bertrand Grabowski, managing director and board of 
directors, DVB Bank.
Unlike many of its competitors, DVB does not do export credit loans. The bank chooses not to structure or lend 
export credit for three reasons. First, its airfinance platform is organized to use capital asset-based deals. Any 
distraction is a potential loss of resources. Two, the margins are too low &(EURO)" traditionally between 20 basis 
points and 30 basis points. (The higher cost of funding in 2008 and 2009 led to higher export credit costs.) Third, 
since export credit financing is based on price, the bank believes it is a commodity product. So when banks 
compete for transactions, the deal will be won on price rather than franchise. DVB is more interested in building a 
relationship with clients than competing on price. 
The bank has a range of clients &(EURO)" lessors and airlines alike. Of its 20 core clients, more than 10 are 
operating lessors. Although DVB does not often lend to first-tier airlines, it provides structuring expertise for top-
rated airlines, such as Lufthansa and Ryanair. Perhaps it seems unusual for an aviation bank to have more core 
BANK PROFILE: The right deal for the right price
relationships with lessors than airlines, but Grabowski says: &(EURO)oeI'm financing an operating lease not an 
operating lessor.&(EURO)
DVB only does non-recourse financing for lessors. Grabowski says that lessors' balance sheets can be difficult to 
read, and also when there is a flight-to-quality in terms of funding it goes to the airline and not the lessor.
&(EURO)oeSo I don't want to do recourse lending to lessors. I'll do financing ring-fenced on a particular structure 
for a lease transaction sponsored by a lessor, which I know and appreciate for its performance. The equity brought 
by the lessor is a very motivated piece of money, ahead of the bank's senior risk, because they have the platform 
and it is their money at stake. It's an additional protection.&(EURO)
He adds: &(EURO)oeStructurally, financing an operating lease is a better protected proposition than funding an 
airline. But, of course, you have to be ready to absorb a portion of residual value on the asset.&(EURO)
The bank has a specialized asset management team, which can repossess and remarket aircraft if a leasing 
company goes into bankruptcy or in case of a lessee default. &(EURO)oeA bank that doesn't have that platform 
capability might not want to take on the performance risk,&(EURO) says Grabowski.
Airlines make up 40% of DVB's customers. Though the bank cannot compete on price for first-tier airline clients, it 
has exposure to these airlines through operating leases, which are priced close to 300 basis points because they 
have residual risks on the aircraft. 
&(EURO)oeWe are interested to move up the quality of our lessees to the extent that we are finding airlines that are 
prepared to pay the Libor plus 300 basis points that they were not prepared to pay before and we'd like to increase 
our portfolio.&(EURO)
Apart from DVB's 20 core clients the bank also searches for opportunistic deals. For instance, eight months ago 
DVB financed two A330s for Thai Airways. It was a first for DVB, which was previously unable to do a deal with the 
airline because historically Thai Airways could get pricing for less than 100 basis points. DVB was able to increase 
its exposure and Thai Airways found finance at a time when liquidity was scarce. 
&(EURO)oeIt's opportunistic and we see in our franchise the widest possible scope for credit profile and 
rating,&(EURO) says Grabowski. &(EURO)oeThe more you go up the airline ladder, the less you will see DVB 
providing the financing because the pricing is not there but we can still provide structuring.&(EURO) For instance, 
DVB has been sole arranger of 20 Japanese operating leases with call option for Ryanair since 2006.
Increasing exposure with aviation funds
As a way of leveraging its asset expertise DVB started its aviation fund, Deucalion, in 2001. After being a senior 
lender for many years, the bank decided to increase its asset risk though managing a fund. Grabowski says that 
Deucalion only buys aircraft with the leases attached and it will never place speculative orders with Airbus or 
Boeing. 
The Deucalion fund uses investors' money and the bank's investment expertise to increase the bank's leverage. 
&(EURO)oeWe don't want to be an operating lessor,&(EURO) says Grabowski. &(EURO)oeWe want to be a 
passive investor &(EURO)" a fund manager.&(EURO) 
This year the fund has acquired eight 777Fs to be leased to Aerologic, a joint venture between Lufthansa and DHL. 
Since 2001 Deucalion has invested more than $400 million in equity towards 65 aircraft and 18 engines, as well as 
investing in equity in two airlines. Of late Deucalion has been a net seller rather than buyer because the managers 
did not think that price correction had been completed. Grabowski hints this might change in 2010. 
In September DVB announced that it would link up with the National Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD) to set up another 
aviation fund. The $1 billion fund will focus on leasing aircraft to airlines &(EURO)" first in the Middle East, but also 
with the intention of expanding globally, drawing investors from the United Arab Emirates and the Gulf countries. 
The deal was scheduled to close by the end of 2009 or the beginning of 2010. 
DVB realized that there was investment potential in the region but was restricted by the fact that it is not a global 
bank. It began working on the deal with NBAD more than a year ago.
BANK PROFILE: The right deal for the right price
&(EURO)oeFor years, everyone has realized that there's money in that region, but we agree that DVB has only one 
way to access this liquidity &(EURO)" through a joint venture with a partner,&(EURO) says Grabowski. 
It was good timing because NBAD was interested in increasing its exposure to the asset class &(EURO)" which 
allows lower risk and lower exposure than other kinds of investments, such as property. 
While Grabowski is forecasting a more difficult year for finance in 2010, DVB will remain and active lender for both 
core and non-core clients. In particular, if refinancing remains difficult for lessors, DVB will be ready to finance this 
segment of the market.

Ryanair has been named as Britain's worst family brand.
The latest FamilyBrands poll shows that the no-frills Irish airline is seen as doing little on promoting family values, 
and is perceived as less caring on its customers.
The poll was based on the customer satisfaction ratings of 1,500 British consumers for 100 well known firms.
Many of those surveyed said that airline companies have a mercenary attitude towards customers, and put profit 
before the welfare of their passengers. Ryanair is Europe's largest budget airline, catering to around 66 million 
passengers yearly. But it has been heavily criticised by respondents for charging each passenger with £5 just for 
purchasing a ticket using a credit card. However, Ryanair spokesman, Stephen McNamara, argued that the findings 
by FamilyBrands, which is commissioned by the ad agency Isobel, are not reliable. He said that Ryanair continues 
to offer unbeatable low cost airfare with a guaranteed no fuel surcharge to help families turn their dream holiday into 
reality.

Aer Lingus issued a fresh warning to staff that it will implement an alternative cost-cutting plan if agreement is not 
reached over proposed measures later on Monday.
Aer Lingus, which has fended off two hostile bids by rival Ryanair, wants to reduce its annual operating costs by 
E97 million by shedding almost a fifth of staff.
The SIPTU and UNITE trade unions, which represent ground staff and technical workers at the company, oppose 
the cuts and the airline has been negotiating with employee representatives over an agreed solution.
"It is critical that savings must be delivered in a full and meaningful way from 2010 and not deferred beyond the 
timeframe of the plan," Chief Executive Christoph Mueller said in a statement. Mueller said proposals from 
employee groups had so far not met these conditions. "We have scheduled an extraordinary board meeting 
tomorrow, at which we will take decisions to proceed with alternative means of delivering the savings within the 
same timeframe as the plan in the absence of agreement," he added.

Ten weeks down, four candidates left and three tasks to go.
Last week's task in Microsoft HQ in Sandyford saw the teams having to perform a demonstration and presentation 
on the revolutionary video conferencing service called Round Table Live Meeting.
This was a technically demanding task. What was frustrating to watch was the inability of either team to remember 
guidance from prior boardrooms.
Creativity is key when you try to be different. This task with the Round Table technology was tailormade for creative 
brilliance.
But both sets of candidates seem to have 'proceed with caution' signs plastered across their foreheads and then, on 
the odd occasion, would go completely overboard. Little or no thought was invested by either team.
Reacting with speed and operating to tight deadlines is key to what Bill Cullen needs in his new apprentice. A great 
example in everyday business marketing is to see how quickly Paddy Power and Ryanair react to the events of the 
day when they turn around a piece of creative marketing overnight.
This is imperative for success and a good example for service providers to exceed expectations for their clients.
Both teams were poor at brainstorming and any kind of idea generation. The expo was a damp squib as both teams 
struggled to make an impact in the crowded room and it was really down to the hungrier and more enthusiastic 
selling attitude of Lucinda and Geraldine for Platinum that won the day in sales of the Microsoft product.
Platinum also shaded the presentation for the Microsoft executives and Cullen's judges by outlining more of the 
advantages of the technology to the audience and by using some under-utilised actors. Next week will see the last 
four candidates create a 30 second radio ad, and a complementary advertorial for Appleby jewellers.
Teams fall flat on Microsoft task
Both ads will need to contain a new creative tagline for the company and will run during the lead-up to Christmas.
A huge shock is coming, as one of the strong favourites crashes out of the series and there is a surprisingly creative 
performance from one of the more sales-oriented candidates where a well-timed risk works out and gets one of the 
teams into the second last programme.

Body
A report published today by aviation experts, Amsterdam Aviation Economics, said that the Irish government's E10 
travel tax will result in revenue losses of E482 million and up to 3,000 lost jobs.
The report, commissioned by Ryanair, Aer Lingus and CitiJet, found that the tax will result in 1.2 million less 
departing passengers and generate just E116 million in tax revenues in the first year following its introduction.
It also warned of further losses to the Government as a result of its travel tax when reduced income tax, increased 
unemployment benefits, reduced VAT receipts and declining corporate tax are taken into account.
The chief executives of Aer Lingus, Cityjet and Ryanair again called on the Irish Government to axe the E10 travel 
tax which has had a devastating impact on airport traffic and visitor numbers since it was introduced on 30th March 
last. The report found that the Irish airlines have absorbed most of the tax and have been forced to reduce capacity 
and move aircraft to bases outside Ireland as a direct result of the imposition of the tax. "This tax is completely 
counter productive and costing the country more than it can ever hope to generate. It does not make sense to 
sacrifice huge revenues and lose jobs and passengers by imposing a tax which will generate just E116 million. We 
have always warned that the direct revenue generated by the travel tax would be significantly less than it would cost 
the State when the adverse impact on business, tourism, jobs and lost taxation receipts were taken into account. 
This view has now been vindicated by the findings of today's report," a joint statement from Christoph Mueller (Aer 
Lingus), Geoffrey O'Byrne-White (Cityjet) and Michael O'Leary (Ryanair) said.

It also warned of further losses to the Government as a result of its travel tax when reduced income tax, increased 
unemployment benefits, reduced VAT receipts and declining corporate tax are taken into account.
The chief executives of Aer Lingus, Cityjet and Ryanair again called on the Irish Government to axe the E10 travel 
tax which has had a devastating impact on airport traffic and visitor numbers since it was introduced on 30th March 
last. The report found that the Irish airlines have absorbed most of the tax and have been forced to reduce capacity 
and move aircraft to bases outside Ireland as a direct result of the imposition of the tax. "This tax is completely 
counter productive and costing the country more than it can ever hope to generate. It does not make sense to 
sacrifice huge revenues and lose jobs and passengers by imposing a tax which will generate just E116 million. We 
have always warned that the direct revenue generated by the travel tax would be significantly less than it would cost 
the State when the adverse impact on business, tourism, jobs and lost taxation receipts were taken into account. 
This view has now been vindicated by the findings of today's report," a joint statement from Christoph Mueller (Aer 
Lingus), Geoffrey O'Byrne-White (Cityjet) and Michael O'Leary (Ryanair) said.

You've got to hand it to Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary .He knows what sells .Cheap airline seats sell. Lottery tickets 
sell.
In the right context, even  4 greasy paninis sell. Sex always sells. Or, more precisely, the annual Ryanair calendar - 
featuring faintly blue-skinned employees of the airline dressed in cheap underwear and lounging around a 
swimming pool - sells.
At least, I presume that's the real reason for it, and not its chief executive's newly-discovered enthusiasm for 
furthering the cause of female empowerment.
Accused last week by the National Women's Council of Ireland (NWCI) of being ''irredeemably old fashioned'', 
O'Leary responded by announcing that the NWCI did not have ''a clue how young women empower themselves''.
I'm not sure O'Leary knows much about this either, but he does have a good track record in empowering his own - 
and his shareholders' - wallets.
He also knows that sex sells, and so will a Ryanair calendar with bikini clad employees.
This observation may merit me immediate admittance to the ranks of what O'Leary describes as the ''loony groups 
like the various Institutes for Ugly Women [who] are simply jealous of our good-looking girls'', but the calendar has 
as much to do with the empowerment of young women as I'm A Celebrity. . .Get Me Out Of Here! has to do with 
celebrities.
I'm no prude, but being photographed in a bra and thong by your employer, so he can flog the pictures to the very 
same groups of leery stag parties you may well end up serving beer to on its 99 cent (plus extras) flight to an airport 
somewhere near a city in Europe, is not empowering.

Nor is selling yourself for sex in order to fund your PhD so you can go on to become a respected specialist in 
developmental neurotoxicology and cancer epidemiology, no matter what you may have read in other Sunday 
newspapers last weekend. And no, not even if your life story ends up as a drama starring Billie Piper.
It's a funny old thing, our attitude to female sexuality. When the Sunday Times outed sex-blogger Zoe Margolis - 
who wrote a book about her sexual exploits under a pseudonym - against her will three days after the book's 
publication in 2006, it pontificated that ''with such a shameless interest in sex it is no surprise Margolis has gone to 
great lengths to try to conceal her identity''.
However, when the same newspaper unveiled Dr Brooke Magnanti as high-class prostitute and blogger Belle de 
Jour, she was described as ''our very own second wave Happy Hooker''.
Journalist India Knight, who was latterly one of Belle de Jour's sternest critics - mainly because she didn't believe 
she was for real, but also because she believed she made prostitution appear glamorous - seemed to have 
forgotten her earlier misgivings.
She seemed entranced, observing how: ''She has the tough-breakable thing that's so hard to manufacture and that 
I also recognise in Belle."
So a woman selling sex for money - as long as she's the right kind of woman, of course - is empowering, alluring, 
seductive. A woman having sex because she enjoys it is shameful.
This contradiction is at the heart of the troubling post-feminist legacy; the phenomenon feminist Ariel Levy has 
called the 'raunch culture'.
In her book, Female Chauvinist Pigs, Levy debunks the idea that ''the new raunch culture . . .was evidence that the 
feminist project had already been achieved. We'd earned the right to look at Playboy; we were empowered enough 
to get Brazilian bikini waxes. Women had come so far, I learned, we no longer needed to worry about objectification 
or misogyny."
We had come so far that we could even buy our boyfriends Ryanair calendars for Christmas as away of showing 
how unthreatened we were by it all; we could cosy up with him for a night in front of Billie Piper playing a PhD 
student turned high class hooker, and admire her innovative solution to her cashflow problems.
But is this really a reflection of how far we've come? Or is it actually a measure of how far we still have to go?
What, I often wonder, do the parents of the girls I see in south Dublin hanging around bus stops on Friday and 
Saturday evenings make of their little ones' 'empowering' dress code?
A couple of weeks ago, on a windy night in October, I had to do a double take as I drove past a girl of about 15 or 
16, standing with some friends as they waited for a bus into town. Her friends were pretty in that braces-and Ugg 
boots kind of way. She was taller than the rest, glossy-haired, with long, gleaming limbs and a stunning figure.
But that wasn't what made me look twice. At first glance, I mistakenly thought she was wearing a swimsuit.
When I looked again I realised there was, in fact, the merest hint of a red skirt flapping around the cheeks of her 
bum.
The funny thing is, she's part of the generation who reportedly believes feminism is 'irrelevant' to her life.
And maybe she's right. Because if this is the best feminism could have done for her and her friends (and their 
brothers and boyfriends) - won them the right to wear the Playboy logo and hang out in lap dancing clubs - then it 
has indeed been an utterly wasted exercise.
Really, it's no surprise that lots of people believed at first that Belle de Jour was the product of a fevered male 
imagination. She was, after all, the ultimate fantasy of a generation reared on porn - the kind of boys who are

amazed when they first get intimate with a girl, to discover that females have pubic hair too. Belle had the lacy 
knickers, the sexual tricks, the Chanel nail polish, the big brain and the bigger boobs. She was a walking, talking, 
anal sex-performing Jessica Rabbit with a doctorate. But best of all - she was yours for just stg£300 an hour!
When her true identity was revealed as a top research scientist, I felt slightly devastated. I'd have been happier if 
she was really a sleazy male journalist who spent his days in a dressing gown and a haze of cigarette smoke.
As role models go, give me Jessica Rabbit any day. At least she knows she's a cartoon.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has accused the Department of Transport of being corrupt.
He has claimed this is because it has directed the Aviation Regulator to raise passenger fees at Dublin Airport.
Such a direction has had the effect of undermining the statutory independence of the regulator, he said.
Mr O'Leary added that Ryanair is seeking a judicial review of the instructions sent by the Minister for Transport to 
the regulator last month on the matter. The airline chief executive also called for the regulator's office to be 
abolished, at a saving of 5m euro a year. Mr O'Leary said the direction to the regulator had been in a letter from 
transport minister Noel Dempsey, telling it to ensure that the Dublin Airport Authority's financial viability was 
protected in order to implement government policy. This, he said, meant the operation of the authority on a 
commercial basis without receiving state funds. "Last week's direction by the Department of Transport to order the 
Aviation Regulator to jack up passenger prices at Dublin Airport by 40pc in 2010 shows yet again that the 
Department of Transport is the corrupt downtown office of the DAA," Michael O'Leary told a press conference. He 
called for the second terminal at Dublin Airport to be mothballed.

The main Dublin shares index edged out of the red but still closed the week over a hundred points lower with banks

The index rose by 8.09 points to 2,875.92.
The European Commission has approved the extension of Ireland's State guarantee on bank deposits and debt but 
this did very little to push financial stocks out of the slump they languished in for most of the past week.
Shares in AIB fell by 4c to E1.70, Bank of Ireland rose by 2c to E1.69 and Irish Life and Permanent gained 1c to 
E3.45. Elsewhere and over in Britain, pubs group Fuller, Smith and Turner reported strong first half results to 
September 26th 2009. In the managed pubs and hotels business, like-for-like sales were up 2.8pc. Magners Irish 
Cider has been pushed heavily in the chain and C and C's shares edged up 1c to E2.49. The worst of the UK 
housing market downturn was in the final quarter of 2008. Davy Research today said that, as has been clear in UK 
mortgage approval and housing transaction figures, activity levels have recovered a good deal since then. Although 
nowhere near as timely as the aforementioned data series, housing start figures confirm this recovery. Official 
figures from the UK's Department for Communities and Local Government indicate that English housing starts, 
seasonally adjusted, recovered from just 16,210 in Q4 2008 to 25,820 in the third quarter of this year (Q1: 18,350; 
Q2: 21,840). Shares in Kingspan gained 5c to E5.57, Grafton gained 2c to E3.20 and CRH rose 5c to E17.15. The 
rising price of paper packing materials on the world market is good news for Ireland's Smurfit Kappa, whose shares 
rose 4c to E5.74. Reports suggest that Spanish-based paper company Europac has announced a further E50/tonne 
increase in kraftliner prices from January 1st 2010. This follows the E50/tonne increase implemented in September 
and will bring the increase in kraftliner prices in line with recycled prices. SKG is the largest producer of kraftliner in

the airline would break-off negotiations at the end of November should no decision be made by then. "In a general 
sense, this leaves us no further on from the Ryanair Q2 results in early November when they highlighted the same 
deadline. But with the deadline looming, its clearly getting to crunch time and we'll reserve judgement on what 
happens next until the deadline passes," said Goodbody's analyst, Eamonn Hughes. Shares in Ryanair rose 1c to

The main Dublin shares index edged out of the red but still closed the week over a hundred points lower with banks 
once again the biggest drag.
The index rose by 8.09 points to 2,875.92.
The European Commission has approved the extension of Ireland's State guarantee on bank deposits and debt but 
this did very little to push financial stocks out of the slump they languished in for most of the past week.
Shares in AIB fell by 4c to E1.70, Bank of Ireland rose by 2c to E1.69 and Irish Life and Permanent gained 1c to 
E3.45. Elsewhere and over in Britain, pubs group Fuller, Smith and Turner reported strong first half results to 
September 26th 2009. In the managed pubs and hotels business, like-for-like sales were up 2.8pc. Magners Irish 
Cider has been pushed heavily in the chain and C and C's shares edged up 1c to E2.49. The worst of the UK 
housing market downturn was in the final quarter of 2008. Davy Research today said that, as has been clear in UK 
mortgage approval and housing transaction figures, activity levels have recovered a good deal since then. Although 
nowhere near as timely as the aforementioned data series, housing start figures confirm this recovery. Official 
figures from the UK's Department for Communities and Local Government indicate that English housing starts, 
seasonally adjusted, recovered from just 16,210 in Q4 2008 to 25,820 in the third quarter of this year (Q1: 18,350; 
Q2: 21,840). Shares in Kingspan gained 5c to E5.57, Grafton gained 2c to E3.20 and CRH rose 5c to E17.15. The

Ryanair will wait until the end of this month or very early in December to reach a deal with Boeing on a fresh batch 
of aircraft orders or end its long-running relationship, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary warned today.
He also said that he plans to give himself, his executives and shareholders a big bonus. "Around mid- to end-2011 
we'll be looking at very substantial senior management bonuses and distributions to shareholders, in that order," 
O'Leary said. "I think I'm worth it."
Speaking about the Boeing negotiations, he said that, if no preliminary agreement is reached around the end of the 
month, allowing time to sign a formal deal by the end of 2009, Ryanair will no longer buy its aircraft, O'Leary said in 
the latest of his threats in the bargaining process with Boeing.
O'Leary, renowned in the industry for driving hard bargains, already warned earlier this month that talks on ordering 
200 aircraft for 2013-16 delivery had not progressed much and that he could hence slow down Ryanair's rapid 
growth from 2013. "I am not wasting another Christmas holiday trying to talk to guys in Seattle," O'Leary said, 
referring to Boeing's home base, adding he saw a deal highly unlikely. O'Leary also reiterated he could break with 
his policy of not paying any dividends, adding that mid- to late 2011 could be the time to start returning cash to 
shareholders as Ryanair's current capital investment programme would be tailing off by then.

The Dublin market fell for the third time this week with bank shares, especially Irish Life and Permanent, the biggest 
drag on the ISEQ.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 21.29 points to 2,885.07.
Worries over how the EU Commission will view the Irish Government's plans to revamp the financial system 
persisted today after the EU executive outlined the conditions imposed on KBC, ING and Lloyds as a result of their 
receipt of state aid following a review of their submitted business plans. KBC is to "divest or run down" a significant 
number of businesses in CEE, but notes that it "will continue to retain an important presence in the region" and the 
EC is satisfied that this will not cause any risks to the financial stability in the region as a result.
Shares in AIB fell by 7c to E1.71, Bank of Ireland dropped 3c to E1.64 but Irish Life and Permanent was the biggest 
faller, declining 28c to E3.45. Shares in insurer, FBD, jumped 38c to E6.78 after it said it is confident that full year 
operating earnings per share will be ahead of the current average expectations of 86 cent a share - barring 
exceptional claims events for the rest of the year. In an interim management update today, the insurance group said 
that it has maintained a solid trading performance with operating profits seen in the second half of 2009 to date. 
This is despite the challenging market conditions. Aer Lingus released a statement updating on its cost plan. It 
acknowledged the current challenging operating environment and reiterated the fact that it needs to achieve its 
target E97m annual savings as part of its "Transformational Plan" in order to "maintain its present scale of 
operations". It is currently in the LRC with the unions to thrash out some agreement on how these savings will be 
made. Shares in the airline gained 1c to E0.57. Ryanair fell by 5c to E2.85. British gambling Website, bwin has 
reported net gaming revenue of E83.3m in its third quarter, in-line with market expectations. Its sports betting 
franchise continues to perform strongly, with player numbers up 17pc (-10pc in Q2, 09); stake per slip up 5pc (+4pc

yesterday afternoon at 12.30 euro a share.
Body
News In Brief
## Embattled developer Liam Carroll's 29.8pc stake in Irish Continental Group was placed on the market yesterday 
afternoon at 12.30 euro a share, erasing fears that loans underpinning the stake would end up in the National Asset 
Management Agency . Goodbody Stockbrokers managed the sale for Allied Irish Banks, which has effectively been 
in control of the position since it appointed a receiver to the developer's South Morton investment vehicle, which 
held the shares. The bank had lent Mr Carroll up to 175m euro to build up his stake in 2007. However, the 
placement of the stock only generated 87.8m euro , meaning AIB most likely faces having to write down half the 
value of the loan. ICG shares closed down 4.1pc last night at 12.85 - Irish Independent
## A high profile property developer has described the government's projections for NAMA as "off the wall" and said 
the prospect of the bad bank is "pretty frightening". Mick Wallace, managing director of Wallace Construction, said 
that the government's projections for NAMA were misguided. "If you worked in the business you'd know they were 
completely off the wall," he said. - Irish Times
## The Irish arm of upmarket US jeweller Tiffany made a 648,000 euro loss here during the 21 months to the end of 
last January, new accounts filed for the business reveal. The company opened its first boutique here in November 
last year at Brown Thomas in Dublin. The Tiffany accounts show that the Irish subsidiary recorded revenue of 1.5m 
euro in the 21 months reporting period, and incurred operating expenses of 1.57m euro. It employs about 18 staff. - 
Irish Independent ## The High Court yesterday gave permission to Anglo Irish Bank to sell properties and assets 
worth 11m euro belonging to alleged fraudster Breifne O'Brien. In addition a number of people, including friends 
and family, are pursuing Mr O'Brien for 18m euro, which they gave him to invest on their behalf, but which he

Highlight: Michael O'Leary
Chief executive of Ryanair
'I am optimistic about Europe in the next five to 10 years because of the accession countries'
Body
Michael O'Leary is not the typical Anglo-Irish businessman. The head of Ryanair, the Irish low-cost airline, says he 
is pinning his hopes on continental Europe in the coming years rather than the UK and Ireland. And, unlike Carlos 
Ghosn of Renault, it is a visceral dislike of the governments there that spurs his judgment.
With the outspoken Mr O'Leary it is sometimes hard to know whether he means something or says it because it 
furthers his fights with everybody from the UK government to Brussels. But he believes the UK and Ireland will 
broadly continue in a recession for the next year while continental Europe will enjoy a slow recovery. "There has 
been massive government mismanagement [in the UK and Ireland]. The public finances are in a mess."
His dislike of politicians even extends to rare praise from the head of an industrial company about the European 
Central Bank. "The best thing that has happened to the European economy is that rates are now set by German 
bankers and not politicians."
But this love of the Continental and dislike of the Anglo-Saxon only extends so far. He says France and Germany 
will recover quicker because they fell less far, as they were "the laggards" before the crisis, way behind the US and 
UK.
Talk of the revival of the Franco-German axis in Europe is shot down. Instead Mr O'Leary extols the virtues of the 
European Union's enlargement, bringing in countries from central and eastern Europe more in line with the US 
model.
"I am optimistic about Europe in the next five to 10 years because of the accession countries and how they've 
changed the view," he says from his base in Dublin.
"The UK-eastern Europe axis is now much more dominant than the Franco-German one."
Airline industry
His recipe for economic growth is to "roll back the red tape". His particular worry in Europe is "that social costs are 
far too high and there is lots of over-regulation". All that plays into Ryanair's quest for lower costs as well as his 
desire for a scrap.
He repeats his well-worn line of Ryanair loving the recession, before adding: "The challenge is to be nimble. Any 
eejit [idiot] can make money in a boom time. It's much harder when things are tough."

EasyJet braced for tough winter after fuel costs eat into profits
EasyJet braced for tough winter after fuel costs eat into profits

Higher fuel costs contributed to a halving of profits at EasyJet, although the group increased revenue per seat by 
more than 4 per cent.
The low-cost airline also raised its target for cost savings following the renegotiation of a large engineering contract.
Although the price of oil has fallen from a high of $147.27 in July 2008 to about $80 a barrel this month, EasyJet 
had hedged its fuel prices at higher rates than the average spot price over the year, causing an "adverse variance 
to market rates" for fuel of about £330m for the full year.
The company anticipated a tough winter but said that if fuel prices remained constant, 2010 would see a substantial 
profit improvement on this year.
EasyJet has taken steps to contain costs over the year, retiring 19 high-cost aircraft, and it yesterday announced it 
had renegotiated a £1bn maintenance agreement with SR Technics to save £175m during the next 11 years.
EasyJet has now raised its target for cost savings from £125m by 2012, first identified in 2008, to £190m.
Andy Harrison, chief executive, said: "The big improvements come from additional maintenance savings, which is 
linked to the SRT contract.
"We also see substantial improvements in our airport and ground-handling costs because EasyJet has been able to 
negotiate better airport deals in a recessionary climate, where there's a number of the non-regulated airports who 
are keen to have our business," said Mr Harrison.
For the year to September 30, pre-tax profit slid 50 per cent from £110.2m to £54.7m on revenue that rose 13 per 
cent from £2.36bn to £2.67bn. Earnings per share fell 14 per cent to 16.6p.
Passenger numbers increased 3.4 per cent to 45.2m, while the load factor - a measure of how many seats on a 
flight are booked - rose 1.4 percentage points to 85.5 per cent. Revenue per seat climbed by 4.1 per cent in 
EasyJet braced for tough winter after fuel costs eat into profits
constant currency, helped by a cut in the capacity of competitors and a surge in ancillary revenues - sales of 
services not directly related to the seat cost, such as baggage-checking. The shares closed down 14.2p at 378p.
  FT Comment 
EasyJet appears to have made the wrong bet on the direction of the oil price, making Ryanair's decision last year 
not to hedge look prescient. However, EasyJet has performed admirably in increasing revenue per seat by 4.1 per 
cent in this brutal recession for the airline industry, while Ryanair's average fares over the summer headed in the 
opposite direction: down 17 per cent. Investors seeking a bet on the recovery of air travel might be attracted to the 
group's shares, which trade on a forward price/earnings ratio of about 14, a discount to Ryanair's 17.

Highlight: 'Mundane growth' in shorter run
Belief in continent remains strong
Body
Growth in Europe is likely to be anaemic in the short-term but longer-term prospects for business are still healthy, 
according to some of the continent's leading chief executives.
In a series of interviews with the Financial Times, chief executives spoke of their continued belief in Europe despite 
its portrayal by some as increasingly stuck between a buoyant Asia and a still-mighty US.
"We've been through something that is not just a normal economic downturn. It is going to take a while to get back 
to where we were. It is going to be very mundane growth. But ultimately, I would be optimistic for Europe," said 
Michael O'Leary, the bluff chief executive of low-cost airline Ryanair.
Peter Sands, chief executive of Standard Chartered, may be an evangelist for Asian growth - where his bank does 
most of its business - but said that Europe could not be written off: "[It is] just such a big part of the world economy."
Their comments come as Europe has moved out of its deepest recession in decades, after growth in the third 
quarter was 0.4 per cent in the eurozone.
But corporate profitability remains in the doldrums, although it is improving. Third-quarter results showed that profits 
were down 18 per cent compared with last year for eurozone companies. But compared with the previous quarter, 
they were up 11 per cent, suggesting that the worst was now over.
As the economy and profits begin to recover, chief executives are starting to return to what they see as the big 
themes for the future: the shift of economic power towards emerging markets, the future of manufacturing and the 
role of governments.
David Michael, the head of the globalisation practice at Boston Consulting Group, speaks for many business 
leaders when he argues that "up to 90 per cent of global growth will come from major emerging markets".
Long-term prospects regarded as healthy
While that spells problems for Europe's economies, many of the continent's largest companies remain sanguine. 
They are targeting strong growth in these emerging countries to counter the sluggishness of their domestic markets. 
The chairman of a leading Swiss company said: "It is an exaggeration but it is almost that Europe can do badly and 
we can do well because we are in emerging markets and the US."
On the future of manufacturing on the continent, Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of French and Japanese carmakers 
Renault and Nissan, has drawn up a list of activities that will prosper in Europe, those that will die and those in 
between. What is striking is how he often makes government support the differentiating factor as to what falls in 
each list.
So, green products, heavily pushed by European governments through subsidies for technologies such as wind and 
solar power, "will play a big role", said Mr Ghosn. Low-cost products will "not have a role in Europe", he continued. 
And he meant not just western Europe: "They will go to North Africa, India and China but not eastern Europe over 
the long term".
Eastern European chief executives would rail against that idea, with Jacek Krawiec, the head of PKN-Orlen, 
Poland's largest oil company, emphasising the higher growth potential of his region compared with western Europe.
The role of governments is controversial, with questions over what happens when governments withdraw their 
support for an industry. Mr Ghosn himself notes the "adverse effect" that will come next year after the end of 
various car scrappage schemes.
And while companies seemed optimistic about the future of European business, they were less sure about Europe's 
place in the world. Mr O'Leary, asked about the rapid growth of emerging markets, said: "I don't think Europe gets 
left behind - it just gets increasingly marginalised."

Body
The ISEQ index of Irish shares sank deeper in to the red as investors sold off Irish Life and Permanent stocks after 
the group hikes its bad debt provisions.
The index fell by 57.54 points to 2,899.81.
Irish Life and Permanent said that impairment provisions in its banking business would be higher this year than 
previously forecast as commercial property values continued to fall. Its share price slumped almost 15pc at one 
stage on the news.
In an interim management statement, IL and P said that bad debt provisions in the second half would be broadly in 
line with the first half. It said it would raise the estimated total provisions for the three years to 2011 to between 
E800m and E900m. Davy Research said that the statement from the group highlights pressure on the bank's net 
interest margin due to an effort to improve its funding profile and higher loan loss guidance. The net interest margin 
is now expected to be between 80bps and 85bps for the full year versus previous guidance of 90bps, Davy analyst, 
Stephen Lyons said. Shares in IL and P closed 53c lower at E3.88 while AIB dropped by 6c to E1.74 and Bank of 
Ireland lost 7c to E1.66. The minister for Finance Brian Lenihan today said that he has not approved the salary 
arrangements of AIB executive Colm Doherty, who will shortly be appointed managing director of the bank. In a 
terse statement to the media referring to reports that Mr Doherty's salary will be in the region of E633,000 - well 
above the Government's cap on pay for top bank executives - the Minister confirmed that he received a proposal 
from Allied Irish Bank on certain salary arrangements. "The Minister has not approved these arrangements. Any 
suggestion that the Minister has is inaccurate," a statement from the Department said. Elsewhere, one of Ryanair's 
main rivals, EasyJet released its full year results. For the twelve months to September 30 it reporting an underlying 
pre tax profit of £43.7m, (versus company guidance at the third quarter stage of £25-50m and consensus of £48m). 
At the earnings per share level, the airline reported an EPS of 16.9 pence, down 14.6pc and compared to

The ISEQ index of Irish shares sank deeper in to the red this morning as investors sold off Irish Life and Permanent 
stocks after the group hikes its bad debt provisions.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 40.47 points to 2,916.88.
Irish Life and Permanent said that impairment provisions in its banking business would be higher this year than 
previously forecast as commercial property values continued to fall. Its share price slumped almost 11pc on the 
news.
In an interim management statement today, IL and P said that bad debt provisions in the second half would be 
broadly in line with the first half. It said it would raise the estimated total provisions for the three years to 2011 to 
between E800m and E900m. Davy Research said that the statement from the group highlights pressure on the 
bank's net interest margin due to an effort to improve its funding profile and higher loan loss guidance. The net 
interest margin is now expected to be between 80bps and 85bps for the full year versus previous guidance of 
90bps, Davy analyst, Stephen Lyons said. Shares in IL and P fell by over 10pc or 46c to E3.95 while AIB dropped 
by 5c to E1.75 and Bank of Ireland lost 9c to E1.63. The minister for Finance Brian Lenihan today said that he has 
not approved the salary arrangements of AIB executive Colm Doherty, who will shortly be appointed managing 
director of the bank. In a terse statement to the media referring to reports that Mr Doherty's salary will be in the 
region of E633,000 - well above the Government's cap on pay for top bank executives - the Minister confirmed that 
he received a proposal from Allied Irish Bank on certain salary arrangements. "The Minister has not approved these 
arrangements. Any suggestion that the Minister he has is inaccurate," a statement from the Department said. 
Elsewhere, one of Ryanair's main rivals, EasyJet released its full year results. For the twelve months to September 
30 it reporting an underlying pre tax profit of £43.7m, (versus company guidance at the third quarter stage of £25-
50m and consensus of £48m). At the earnings per share level, the airline reported an EPS of 16.9 pence, down

Body
British low-cost airline easyJet has reported a 64.5 percent fall in full-year profit, hit by rising fuel costs and lower 
interest income.
But it said it expected profit to be substantially higher in 2010.
The carrier has this morning posted an underlying pretax profit of 43.7 million pounds on revenue up 12.9 percent at 
2.66 billion pounds for the year end-September.
EasyJet said the reduction in profit was driven by a fuel cost increase of 86.1 million pounds and interest income, 
which was 30.5 million pounds lower. "The issue with our profits is to do with the way in which our fuel hedging 
works; we average fuel prices which means that there is a delay between the drop in market prices and the benefit 
to easyjet so we'll see a 100 million pound improvement to our profits in 2010," Chief Executive Andy Harrison told 
BBC Radio. Shares in easyJet, which have risen 16 percent in the last three months, were 0.4 percent higher at 
392.4 pence in early trade, valuing the airline at around 1.6 billion pounds. The airline said passenger numbers rose 
3.4 percent to 45.2 million and that its load factor improved by 1.4 percentage points to 85.5 percent. It added that 
forward bookings were "broadly in line" with last year. "The general assumption is that last year was the bottom of 
the cycle, which was certainly the case in fuel price terms but may turn out not to have been the case in demand 
terms," said Astaire analyst Douglas McNeill. The carrier said it sees a tough winter ahead but that at current fuel 
prices and exchange rates, it expects to make a substantial profit improvement in 2010. The global recession has 
battered the airline industry as consumers cut back on trips abroad and lucrative business class travellers fly less. 
Full service airlines such as BA, which last week agreed to merge with Spain's Iberia, has seen its profits dented by 
growing competition from low-cost carriers and faces potential labour strikes this Christmas. Earlier this month Irish 
rival Ryanair posted an 80 percent rise in first-half profit but said it would be willing to curb growth in its quest to cut 
costs further. The International Air Transport Association recently said it expected airlines to lose dollar 11 billion

Body
British low-cost airline easyJet has reported a 64.5 percent fall in full-year profit, hit by rising fuel costs and lower 
interest income.
But it said it expected profit to be substantially higher in 2010.
The carrier has this morning posted an underlying pretax profit of 43.7 million pounds on revenue up 12.9 percent at 
2.66 billion pounds for the year end-September.
EasyJet said the reduction in profit was driven by a fuel cost increase of 86.1 million pounds and interest income, 
which was 30.5 million pounds lower. "The issue with our profits is to do with the way in which our fuel hedging 
works; we average fuel prices which means that there is a delay between the drop in market prices and the benefit 
to easyjet so we'll see a 100 million pound improvement to our profits in 2010," Chief Executive Andy Harrison told 
BBC Radio. Shares in easyJet, which have risen 16 percent in the last three months, were 0.4 percent higher at 
392.4 pence in early trade, valuing the airline at around 1.6 billion pounds. The airline said passenger numbers rose 
3.4 percent to 45.2 million and that its load factor improved by 1.4 percentage points to 85.5 percent. It added that 
forward bookings were "broadly in line" with last year. "The general assumption is that last year was the bottom of 
the cycle, which was certainly the case in fuel price terms but may turn out not to have been the case in demand 
terms," said Astaire analyst Douglas McNeill. The carrier said it sees a tough winter ahead but that at current fuel 
prices and exchange rates, it expects to make a substantial profit improvement in 2010. The global recession has 
battered the airline industry as consumers cut back on trips abroad and lucrative business class travellers fly less. 
Full service airlines such as BA, which last week agreed to merge with Spain's Iberia, has seen its profits dented by 
growing competition from low-cost carriers and faces potential labour strikes this Christmas. Earlier this month Irish 
rival Ryanair posted an 80 percent rise in first-half profit but said it would be willing to curb growth in its quest to cut 
costs further. The International Air Transport Association recently said it expected airlines to lose dollar 11 billion 
easyJet profit plunges on fuel costs easyJet Down
this year. easyJet said it had removed 19 expensive aircraft from the fleet to cut costs and expected to deliver cost 
savings of around 175 million pounds over the next 11-years. (c) Reuters

Patrick Hesnan is chief operating officer of Total Retail Control (TRC). Established in 1991, TRC specialises in IT 
Solutions for the retail and hospitality sectors. The company has 20 staff and annual revenues of  4.1 million. It has 
just launched www.loyalty.ie, a web-based customer loyalty system for the retail sector, and was recently appointed 
as sole distributor for Torex point of sale technology in the Irish market.
What are the main responsibilities of your job?
I oversee and ensure the smooth day-to-day operation of Total Retail Control. I am also the first port of call for any 
issues that do not fit with anybody else's job function. Managing 20 staff can be intense, but I thrive on the 
pressure.
What are your professional motivators?
To ensure TRC provides Irish retailers with best-in class technology and services.
The retail sector has taken a big hit in the recession and it is my job to make sure that the IT investments made by 
our customers help them to run more efficiently.
How would you describe your work style?
I always look for a win/win outcome in my dealings with people. This is not always possible, but the approach helps 
me to identify those whose aims are similar to my own. These are the people I can develop long-term partnerships 
with.
What would you rate as your best business decision?
I have stopped trying to reinvent the wheel. In the nineties, we developed all of our systems in-house and from the 
ground up. Our focus was on making the systems, rather that delivering solutions to the customer. We now allow 
Working Week
companies like Torex and Microsoft to do what they do best and we use our experience and knowledge to tailor 
their solutions for our customers.
What is the most valuable lesson you have learned?
Be candid and honest. You can save a lot of time and do a great service to yourself and others by speaking 
honestly and candidly at all times.
Who do you most admire in Irish industry?
Michael O'Leary may not be the most popular guy in the country, but you really have to admire what he has 
achieved with Ryanair. He takes the candid approach to a new level, but you know where you stand with him and 
he gets things done. Ryanair has opened up options, for both business and personal travel. This can only be good 
for us as a country.
What are your expectations for Irish business in the months ahead?
This is a tough question - one that people much more qualified than myself have tried to answer. I expect money to 
start moving again once we get the Nama issue and the December budget out of the way. To other businesses I 
would say; ''get your cost base in line this year and survive, because the wheels of commerce will start rolling again 
soon''.
What is your ultimate professional goal?
To guide TRC forward so that it is on the shopping list of every progressive retailer who understands the need for 
technology in their business.

If the Japanese weren't so well mannered, my Monday evening could have been an episode of The Apprentice or 
Dragons' Den . In a tower high above Tokyo's Roppongi district, 30 branding and marketing students had gathered 
to present the fruits of a one-week assignment to their sensei (master) and his special guest (me).
The homework was far from simple: "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Japan Airlines?" The class had initially 
been divided into five groups to tackle the issue of what to do with Japan's flag carrier, and had now regrouped to 
present a common case. Takashima-  sensei did the introductions and set the scene for the problems facing the 
airline - and the students.
Earlier in the day, he had told me to dispense with any niceties when the time came to critique the presentation.
"You want me to strip away the Japanese niceties, Takashima- san ?" I asked.
"Yes Tyler- san ," he replied. "Tell it like it is."
"Really? No holds barred?"
"Tell them as an international passenger Tyler- san ."
Takashima- san wrapped up his brief introduction and handed the microphone to the presentation team of three. 
Sitting front row, I was handed the presentation in A4 format, while at the front of the room the screen flickered to 
life.
In a mixture of English and Japanese, a banker from Goldman Sachs went through an abridged history of JAL and 
the problems facing the industry as a whole. In short, the airline had an old fleet, too many bureaucrats at the helm 
and a product that didn't reflect the tastes of modern Japanese or international travellers.
While I scribbled notes on the presentation and waited for the solution, slides of Singapore Airlines, Emirates and 
Thai popped up on screen, and JAL was put into context within the global civil aviation sector - it was nowhere. The 
gentleman who seemed to be leading the group politely explained, using charts and graphs, that it didn't have a 
natural home in the contemporary aviation scene.
Young dragons take to the skies
Then, with a lack of any dramatic build-up, he clicked to the next slide presenting their solution. I didn't quite know 
what to expect, but the proposed remedy was quite radical - turn the domestic operation into a more service-
minded, dignified low- cost carrier (this is Japan after all, so there wouldn't be much place for a Ryanair-style 
O'Leary character at the controls).
Meanwhile, he said, the long-haul part of JAL should trim its four classes (first, business, premium economy and 
economy) to just two - first class and "smart class". It was hard to gauge where the team might go with their "smart 
class" idea, but after a few minutes of cutesy illustrations and key words the proposition looked sound.
Pitched at higher-spending leisure travellers and small business owners, their catering concept called for high- 
quality yet simple pre-boarding bento boxes, on-board vending machines for alcoholic drinks, free wi-fi, fully flexible 
tickets and 20 per cent more personal space. At various intervals, class members popped up wearing concept 
uniforms; a duty-free teddy bear dressed up as a flight attendant also put in an appearance, and an ad campaign 
based around the theme of gomenasai  ("I'm sorry") flashed up on screen.
"JAL has to say sorry to everyone for its performance," the group leader said. "So we've created a character   [a 
rhinoceros with a JAL logo on his back - go figure] named gomenasai    to be the face of the new airline."
During the feedback session the class listened to our comments and, at appropriate moments, moaned in 
agreement with particularly sharp remarks. I left the seminar hoping someone might get this plan to one of the 
teams advising JAL.
The following morning, I made my way to a press conference hosted by All Nippon Airways (ANA), JAL's slightly 
smaller but more aggressive rival. Dubbed "Inspiration of Japan", ANA had chosen its flagship hotel to launch its 
new long-haul in-flight concept on the same day that JAL was delivering more bad news. Scores of cameramen and 
photographers waited outside while press officers ushered journalists inside for sneak previews. Across a back wall 
was a display that looked the biggest wedding buffet in Japan but was, in fact, ANA's new approach to catering - 
highlights included a businessclass snack menu from best-selling celebrity chef Harumi Kurihara, as well as an 
expanded range of meals for economy.
"Economy passengers too will be able to buy meals from business class if they want to," explained one marketing 
executive. "They'll also be able to select whatever they want to drink and send their order straight to the galley via 
the touch screen at their seat."
With a completely new concept that should give the likes of Cathay and Lufthansa something to worry about and 
also cause JAL to despair, it was refreshing to see corporate Japan on the front foot as well as demonstrating that 
the word "civil" can still be paired with "aviation".

BAA to put £500m into Heathrow and Stansted
BAA to put £500m into Heathrow and Stansted

BAA's London airports - Heathrow and Stansted - are to receive a £500m cash injection from shareholders and 
other parts of the BAA group. The money will be used to pay down debt, strengthen its financial ratios and ease the 
company's access to capital markets ahead of a planned bond issue next year.
"The injection furthers BAA's strategy of developing a long-term platform to finance its rolling programme of 
investment to upgrade its London airport facilities and improve service to customers," BAA said yesterday.
BAA's three shareholders, which are Ferrovial, the Spanish infrastructure group, GIC, the Singapore's government 
investment group, and an investment vehicle controlled by the state pension fund of Quebec, will contribute £200m 
of new equity in proportion to their equity holdings in the group.
The remaining £300m will come from an internal transfer of funds, split equally between BAA Airports Limited and 
FGP Topco, BAA's holding company. This internal transfer of funds has been approved by the company but the 
£200m in new equity will require the approval of the boards of BAA's three shareholders.
The London airports will receive £260m immediately, with the other £240m to become available in January. BAA 
said that the cash injection would pull down net debt expressed as a percentage of the value of the group's 
regulatory assets from 74 to about 71 per cent.
This will make it easier for BAA to tap the capital markets early in 2010, although the group declined to say how 
much it was intending to raise. The company has not had a new bond issue since 2006 .
Yesterday's announcement follows BAA's sale last month of Gatwick airport for £1.5bn to Global Infrastructure 
Partners, the infrastructure fund backed by Credit Suisse and General Electric.
BAA had begun preparations for the disposal of Gatwick last year in anticipation of a Competition Commission 
demand in March that it sell three airports, two in London and one in Scotland. By pre-empting the commission's 
final ruling that the airports operator sell Stansted airport, together with either Edinburgh or Glasgow, and Gatwick, 
BAA was hoping to avoid bunching up the asset disposals.
BAA to put £500m into Heathrow and Stansted
BAA spends about £1bn a year on Heathrow, and far less on Stansted in accordance with the wishes of Stansted's 
principal customers, the low-cost airlines Ryanair and Easyjet.
Although the Competition Commission is now insisting that BAA sell Stansted, BAA is seeking to appeal.

it reported that the fall in sales of its prestige jewellery, watches and accessories had slowed in recent months.
Swatch Group , another Swiss watchmaker, rose 2.7 per cent to SFr263.50.
Telecommunications stocks ended the week higher after Sweden's TeliaSonera ended a long-running dispute with

Its shares rose 5.6 per cent to SKr50 while Norway's Telenor , which resolved a conflict with Alfa last month, 
gained 4.6 per cent to NKr77.45.
Banks enjoyed mixed fortunes yesterday as Belgium's KBC Group  and Franco-Belgian Dexia attempted to 
reassure the market that they were closer to reaching restructuring agreements with the European Union.
Positive earnings buoy indices
Both banks rose to profit in the third quarter but traders said it remained less clear which assets Dexia might have 
to sell to appease the EU Competition Commission.
KBC Group advanced 4.5 per cent to EUR33.22, or 9.2 per cent for the week. Shares in Dexia declined 3.1 per cent 
to EUR5.51 yesterday but were up 4.4 per cent for the week.

biotechnology group. The company also raised its full-year operating loss forecast from $127m to $228m.
Volkswagen  preferred shares shed 13.5 per cent over the week to EUR60.25 after sovereign fund Qatar Holdings

Shares in Ryanair rose this morning, helping to push the ISEQ index out of the red as investors looked to today's 
announcement that BA and Iberia are to merge.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 23.15 points to 2,974.03.
Shares in Ryanair rose by 12c to E2.98 after British Airways CEO Willie Walsh said today that his company did not 
want to be 'left behind' after a series of crucial industry alliances from fierce European rivals Air France-KLM and 
Lufthansa. British Airways needs to merge with Spanish carrier Iberia to retain its global ranking and avoid being 
sidelined as crisis drives airline tie-ups and cost cuts, he said. The two airlines sealed a deal last night on a E4.5 
billion merger to create one of the world's biggest airlines, as the two groups grapple with huge losses. BA would be 
the dominant partner, with 55pc of the group.
Shares in Aer Lingus gained 2c to E0.59. Bank shares were mixed after news that the transfer of the largest loans 
to NAMA will take place within a matter of weeks, according to the Minister for Finance. The bill has now been sent 
to the President and is expected to be signed off sometime next week. The minister noted that the legislation still 
needs the final approval of the European Commission (EC). However, no delay is expected as the Department of 
Finance has been in constant contact with the EC prior to and during the drafting of the bill. During a recent 
committee stage debate, the minister also pointed out that the bill's valuation sections were drafted on the basis of 
EC advice. "As we noted earlier this week, NAMA has been broadly approved by the EC, and the two burden-

Japan Airlines, famous for serving Aruga Branca Clareza wine and haemorrhaging cash, has blipped on the buy-out 
radar for months. US peers American Airlines and Delta Air Lines are both fighting to partner the carrier in some 
form to build Pacific exposure, in spite of the target's precarious financial position. But now private equity firm TPG 
is in discussions about perhaps joining any deal with AA, a One World alliance partner of JAL. At a time when the 
private equity industry is reeling from bad returns, airlines would be a surprising investment.
The US airlines' strategic interest in JAL is clear. An "open skies" policy between the US and Japan should soon be 
agreed, easing access to airports for the countries' carriers on both sides of the Pacific. American Airlines in 
particular has very little exposure to the region. But they must be willing to assume some financial burden - JAL's 
loss last quarter was Y100bn and the Japanese transport ministry rates it as insolvent.
A financial sponsor, though, may be less motivated to join in. True, TPG is an experienced airline investor and has 
successfully invested in Continental and Ryanair. But two concerns should rein it back. The first is exit strategy, as 
AA wants JAL for the long haul, while TPG will not. The second may be concern from its own investors. Kohlberg 
Kravis Roberts injected$400m into beleaguered filmmaker Eastman Kodak in September but that investment was 
debt; JAL requires lower-ranking equity.
Some protection may come in the form of Japanese transport minister Seiji Maehara's pledge not to allow JAL to go 
bankrupt. Promised emergency loans will ensure two major airlines continue to fly Japan's skies. Still, for private 
equity investors, the risks seem sky-high.

Low-cost carrier sets year-end ultimatum for airframer to agree terms over massive 737 deal, or risk cancellations
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has set Boeing a year-end ultimatum to agree terms over a huge new order, 
threatening that he will otherwise cease discussions and adopt a new consolidation strategy.
The Irish low-cost airline has been in long-running talks with Boeing about an order for 200 new aircraft to be 
delivered between 2013 and 2016. But O'Leary warns that the discussions will not be pursued indefinitely.
"We have signalled to Boeing that if they are not completed before the year-end, then Ryanair will end its 
relationship with Boeing and confirm a series of order deferrals and cancellations," he says.
O'Leary accuses Boeing of being "unwilling to play its part" in the airline's efforts to reduce costs in the face of 
declining yields, and says the improvement it is seeking on the airframer's offer "is tiny, very small".
He adds: "The difficulty has been getting someone to make a decision at Boeing. I would be optimistic, but not 
confident."
O'Leary says he would "prefer to grow", but if the aircraft deal cannot be agreed, then Ryanair will adopt a new 
strategy that would see an end to its expansion. "If we can't use our cash to buy cheap airliners, then we'll give it 
back to our shareholders."
The airline made the threat as it posted an 80% increase in after-tax profit, to ?387 million ($571 million), for the 
half-year.
Ryanair operates an all-Boeing 737-800 fleet of more than 200 aircraft. The carrier still has 100 more on firm order, 
plus options. Most of these orders were placed in 2002, when Boeing's commercial aircraft arm was being run by 
Alan Mulallay.
O'Leary issues threat to Boeing about order talksRyanair threatens to terminate growth and cancel Boeing 
orders INTRODUCTION:
"We've 100 more aircraft to take [before 2012], 90 firm and 10 options," says O'Leary.
"We'd cancel the 10 options and we'd defer some of the firm aircraft into 2013-14 [without a deal with Boeing]," he 
adds.
Ryanair's half-year passenger numbers were up 15% to 36 million, but revenue declined by 2% to ?1.8 billion as 
average fares fell 17%. The airline expects this slide in fares to reach 20% during the third and fourth quarters, both 
of which will be in loss.
But it is maintaining its full-year guidance, adding that the carrier will be "substantially profitable" - at the lower end 
of the ?200-300 million range.

Aer Lingus Group PLC, Ireland's loss-making airline, reported Monday that third-quarter revenues fell by 10 percent 
compared to a year ago and average fares fell even more steeply.
The airline said it was removing one airplane from long-haul service, reducing its long-haul fleet to five. It said a 
sixth plane might be added next summer.
The carrier, which did not publish earnings figures, said passenger numbers in the third quarter increased 7 percent 
to nearly 3.1 million. Short-haul capacity rose 11 percent, long-haul capacity was cut by 18 percent, and the airline's 
overall load factor was 80.4 percent, a gain of 1.3 percentage points compared to last year.
However, average short-haul fares decreased by 12 percent compared to a year earlier, and long-haul fares were 
down 17 percent.
The figures were nevertheless better than markets expected, according to Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin.
Aer Lingus shares were up 8.6 percent at &#8264;n the London Stock Exchange at midmorning after being up as 
much as 17 percent. On the Irish Stock Exchange, Aer Lingus rose 7 percent in early trading to &#8264;
The company last month announced a survival plan which includes laying off more than 15 percent of its staff, 
cutting pay rates and expanding operations in Britain to survive competition with its much bigger rival, Ryanair.
The airline's chief executive, Christoph Mueller, who took over on Sept. 1, has said the formerly state-owned and 
union-friendly airline has only a 50-50 chance of survival.
The company has spent &#8264;llion ($159 million) this year on restructuring costs, final payments on two new 
A330 aircraft and on operating activity, reducing its net cash to &#8264;llion.

The ISEQ index of Irish shares climbed briefly above 3,000 in early trade today as shares on the Dublin market 
followed a European trend higher.
Markets have been heartened this morning by the weekend G20 meeting which backed the retention of stimuli in its 
participants' economies for the moment.
The ISEQ rose by neary 50 points after this morning's opening to 3,020.
But it quickly sank back to stand just 21.38 points ahead a short time ago at 2,993.34. Banks put a dampener on 
the mood, with concerns continuing about the details of their relationship with NAMA and their ability to raise new 
equity. AIB was down 1c at 191 and Bank of Ireland was off by 197. Irish Life and Permanent, which is not involved 
in the NAMA saga, was ahead by 13c to 502. Aer Lingus gained 9c to 65 after an interim management statement 
this morning reaffirming its determination to take tough steps to solve its problems. Independent News was up 1.5c 
to 19.5c on reports that its banks and bondholders have rejected the latest bid by Denis O'Brien to take control of 
the publishinbg group. Building materials giant CRH is up 44c at 1789, with Elan ahead by 27c at 437. Ryanair has 
risen 4c to 295 and DCC is up 3c at 1930.

Big stocks left behind as small companies perform strongly

It is difficult to convince investors to take a long term punt on Irish shares at the moment, with some of the country's 
biggest stocks among the worst performing in Europe this year.
Elan, CRH and Ryanair are all in the bottom 40 of the Eurostoxx 600 when measured in terms of performance since 
March. One stockbroker commented that there was 'nothing to sell' among Irish shares at the moment, given their 
poor performance.
While Irish stocks are languishing at the bottom on the Eurostoxx 600, the Irish banks come near the top of the 
index when performance over the past six months is measured.
This period marks the entrance of hedge funds into the picture, and the recent sell off has seen the banks' rankings 
fall again on the index.
In terms of trends seen in the rally of recent months, the likes of the smaller European banks, basic resources and 
real estate saw the biggest rebound. This is in part related to the fact that some of the these stocks had the biggest 
recovery to make.
The Irish Stock Exchange is in the bottom 25 of 89 indices across the world. It is up around 10 per cent in the past 
six months, compared with increases of as much as 75 per cent seen by some bourses.
But the biggest trend is the strong performance of small to mid-cap companies. This may be because, at a time like 
this, fund managers sometimes invest in cyclical stocks as they benefit most from a rally. Cyclical stocks are shares 
which are more dependent on economic performance and rise and fall rapidly.
However, after the rally ends, investors generally turn to defensive stocks, such as food and utilities equities.
Big stocks left behind as small companies perform strongly
Ross McEvoy, an equity analyst with Merrion Capital's private clients team said: ''The recent equity market rally has 
proven to be completely indiscriminate by rewarding smaller capitalised and more highly leveraged stocks. Higher 
quality defensive plays have been left well behind.
''The so-called 'dash for trash' saw smaller, riskier, stocks outperform by 50 per cent-plus at the peak of the rally," 
he added.
''The FTSE 250 has outperformed theFTS&EURO;100 by a staggering 22 per cent since December 2008."
McEvoy said that the reason for this was that cyclical stocks make up a fifth of the FTSE 250, against just 6 per 
cent for FTSE 100.
''Given that mid-caps generally have considerably more geared balance sheets and less exposure to international 
economies, this out-performance is somewhat surprising," he said.
''The last six months have seen the biggest rotation out of defensive sectors and into cyclicals ever," said McEvoy.
''Since March 9,the 50 smallest stocks in the S&P 500 are up over four times the gain of the 50 biggest."
''The flight to risk has left some higher quality/large cap companies looking extremely cheap on historical

''Unlike previous bear markets, the multiples of defensives actually contracted last year and are now trading near 
historically low price-earnings levels."

Simply working harder will not help Irish businesses to survive the current trading conditions.
That was the message from Irish and international experts at the Irish Marketing Institute's 30th national marketing 
conference held in Dublin last week.
Mark Hughes, author of the best-selling Buzz marketing, who developed eBay's Half.com website from zero to 
8million customers in less than three years, emphasised the importance of ''out-thinking'' the competition rather 
than outspending in a recession.
Hughes was behind the renaming of the small town of Halfway, Oregon, to Half.com - dubbed by Time magazine as 
''one of the greatest publicity coups'' in history.
''Trust in consumer advertising has fallen 41 per cent in the past three years," said Hughes.
''A recent Forrester study revealed that 92 per cent of Sky Box owners skip through commercials. Other research 
has revealed that nearly a quarter of people believe advertising, while a whopping 70 per cent of people believe 
what they read online. This is the new 'normal' and has turned the advertising industry upside down."
According to Hughes, Buzz marketing works when marketers give customers a good story, put their brand second 
and capture the media by standing out, demanding creativity and policing their product.
''Do you have to act like Ryanair's Michael O'Leary to get buzz?" he asked. ''No, but you do have to do something to 
stand out from your competitors.
''You achieve marketing success when you do something to get people to talk about your product, usually by 
grabbing the media's attention first.
Advertising needs the 'buzz factor' to succeed
''That cost us $100,000, a few computers and the offer to set up websites for local companies, which we're in the 
business of doing anyway," he said.
Technology accelerates buzz exponentially, so businesses should focus on viral advertising on sites such as 
Facebook and YouTube.
''The car manufacturer Honda now advertises in the United States as Facebook. com/Honda," said Hughes.

O'Leary's squeeze on Boeing 's prices could founder

Has Michael O'Leary overplayed his hand with aircraft manufacturers? Last week, the Ryanair chief executive 
issued a stern warning to Boeing, which supplies his entire fleet, that he would not do a deal for more aircraft unless 
the US based aviation giant lowered its prices.
''I regret to report that we have made little progress in our discussion with Boeing for an order of 200 aircraft over 
the last number of months. We won't continue these discussions indefinitely," O'Leary said, as he announced pre-
tax profits of  419 million for the six months to September, up from  105 million a year earlier.
''There is a relatively small gap between us and Boeing on pricing, but we now require Boeing to make a decision. 
All we're asking Boeing to do is share a very small fraction of cost reductions and productivity gains they've made in 
recent years through efficient manufacturing processes''.
But in seeking to benefit from Boeing running its business better by demanding a slice of its costs savings, has 
O'Leary pushed his famed negotiating style too far?
The Ryanair boss struck a famous deal with Boeing in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United 
States, taking advantage of weak demand for new aircraft to lay the groundwork for the airline to finance its huge 
expansion at knockdown prices.
This time around, however, Boeing is in a stronger bargaining position. While O'Leary made the most of the fact 
that he was one of a very small number of potential buyers when placing his last order, his room to manoeuvre has 
been eroded to some degree by the fact that he no longer has a credible fallback position if talks break down.
O'Leary kept the pressure on Boeing in previous talks by hinting at the possibility that Ryanair could, in an extreme 
situation, walk away from the table and do a deal with Airbus, Boeing's arch-rival, instead.
O'Leary's squeeze on Boeing 's prices could founder
On this occasion, however, Airbus has gone cold on Ryanair, signalling that it is no longer prepared to facilitate 
O'Leary's hard bargaining with an unambiguous stance: if O'Leary wants Airbus planes, he will have to pay the 
going rate for them and cutprice deals will not be entertained.
This stance has not done O'Leary any favours. It gives Boeing an extra card in their poker game, as it has all but 
precluded O'Leary from threatening that he will deal with Airbus if Boeing fails to dance to his tune.
Instead, O'Leary went to great pains last week to say that he needed neither Boeing nor Airbus. He outlined 
previously unheard-of plans to bring Ryanair's growth plans to a shuddering halt in 2012.
''If they don't [agree],we will end those discussions, probably about the end of November, and announce a new, 
much slower growth plan for Ryanair for 2010,11 and 12, but no growth after 2012, in which case I think we will run 
the airline far more aggressively for higher profits, bigger cash generation and [we] would plan to distribute the 
surplus cash to shareholders," he said.
''There is no point in us continuing to grow rapidly in a recession while Boeing don't share our vision that this is the 
way forward''.
Yet for Ryanair shareholders accustomed to O'Leary controlling their future destiny, it may be incongruous that 
Ryanair's future strategy -whether it grows or not - will now be decided by Boeing's pricing officials and not their 
own chief executive.
As fallback plans go, vowing to turn Ryanair into a low growth airline will not worry Boeing quite as much as the 
threat that once existed of one of its biggest customers signing a contract with its biggest rival. For a negotiating 
strategy to work it must first be credible.
O'Leary has walked away from or reduced capacity at airports across Europe - including Shannon - safe in the 
knowledge that there are plenty of other bases that will do business with him on his terms.
He may be about to find that aircraft manufacturers will not give in quite so easily. And it may be an expensive 
lesson.

Ryanair to hike non-printed boarding card fee to EUR 100

Ryanair plans to increase the charge for passengers who do not print their own boarding cards to EUR 100, in its 
latest effort to reduce its costs.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said that the increased charge would aim to eliminate instances of passengers 
turning up at airport check-in desks without their boarding cards. The airline currently charges passengers who do 
not print their own boarding cards EUR 40 - or stg£40 (EUR 44) if they are travelling from British airports.
Speaking last week after the airline reported pre-tax profits of EUR 419 million for the six months to September, 
O'Leary said that only ''a tiny number of passengers'' continued to pay the EUR 40 fee, and that most were printing 
out their boarding cards at home when checking in online, before travelling to the airport.
''You really must now check in before you get to the airport. If you don't, the fine is EUR 40; and if that doesn't get 
rid of them all within a very short order, we double that fine to EUR 100," O'Leary said. ''We don't want people 
showing up without the pre-printed boarding card."
Ryanair recently implemented a policy of requiring all passengers to check in online. The airline continues to retain 
a small presence in airport check-in areas to allow passengers to check in their baggage - for a fee of EUR 15 for 
the first bag and EUR 35 for a second. Passengers without any bags to check in go straight to their departure gate 
without any contact with Ryanair staff.

No-frills Irish airline, Ryanair, today said that it is now four times bigger than British Airways in short-haul terms.
It said it carried 6.2 million passengers in October - a 15pc rise - compared to British Airway's 1.6 million, which 
represents a fall of 4pc on the same month last year.
"Ryanair continues to grow rapidly during the recession as passengers switch to Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares 
from BA's high fares and unjustified fuel surcharges. Ryanair's traffic grew by 15pc in Oct to 6.2 million while BA's 
comparable traffic fell by 4pc to just 1.6 million. Ryanair now carries four times BA's traffic in the UK and Europe, 
their most important market. Ryanair will continue to grow and attract BA passengers because Ryanair will continue 
to lower fares," said the airline's Stephen McNamara.

Ryanair today said it would be impossible for it to have 'further discussions' with the Department of Transport (as

(RTTNews) - Low-cost airline easyJet Plc (EZJ.L) Thursday reported an increase in traffic and load factor for the 
month of October 2009.
The Luton, UK-based company&apos;s number of passengers increased 6.6% to 4.22 million from 3.96 million in 
the previous-year month. The company noted that passenger statistics represent the number of earned seats flown, 
which include seats flown whether the passenger turns up or not and seats provided for promotional purposes and 
to staff for business travel.
Load factor, or the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available for passengers, for the 
month was 86.8%, up 3 percentage points from 83.9% in the prior year. easyJet noted that no weighting of the load 
factor is carried out to recognise the effect of varying flight lengths.
Since easyJet is a no-refund airline, once a flight has departed, a no-show customer is generally not entitled to 
change flights or seek a refund.
In September, the airline reported a 1.2 percentage points increase in load factor to 88.1% from 86.9% in the prior-
year September. The company&apos;s number of passengers in September increased 5.3% to 4.4 million from 4.2 
million reported in September of the previous year.
For the rolling 12-months ending October, load factor was 85.7%, up 1.5 percentage point from 84.2% in the same 
period last year. Total passengers traveled on a rolling 12-month basis increased 2.6% to 45.42 million from 44.27 
million a year ago.
Among peers, Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) reported October load factor of 85%, flat with last year. 
Passenger traffic for October grew 15% to 6.16 million from 5.35 million in the year earlier period.
The International Air Transport Association, or IATA, issued a revised global financial forecast in August, which 
sees deeper than the previously projected losses in 2009 owing to rising fuel costs and falling yields. The agency 
expects passenger traffic to decline by 4.0% and cargo by 14% for 2009, compared to its earlier forecasts for 
declines of 8.0% and 17%, respectively. Yields are expected to fall 12% for passenger and 15% for cargo, in 
comparison with its June forecasts of declines of 7% and 11%, respectively.
EZJ is currently trading at 376.80 pence per share, up 0.75%, on the London Stock Exchange.

We shall shortly reach our cruising altitude. That is not an announcement Ryanair investors expect to hear from 
chief executive Michael O'Leary. The low-cost airline maintained its climb rate during the recession to report an 80 
per cent surge in September's half-year earnings. But it could throttle back to a more gradual rate of growth.
In Mr O'Leary's latest attempt to drive a hard bargain with counterparties, he has given Boeing until the end of the 
year to cut prices on aircraft ordered or he will rationalise routes and instead use the cash to pay a maiden 
dividend. He tried a similar tactic with BAA, owner of Ryanair's UK base at Stansted, earlier this year. Lower airport 
fees, he barked, or he would cut winter capacity and move aircraft elsewhere - something he would have done 
anyway.
Whether Boeing executives pay attention is not the point. They are only a prop in a carefully staged message to 
investors designed to signal slower passenger growth. If Boeing comes up trumps, so much the better. If it does 
not, Ryanair will keep chiselling away at unit costs and curb passenger volume growth from 14 per cent to about 8 
per cent over the next three years.
Although falling fuel costs helped, first-half profits increased despite a 17 per cent reduction in fares. Ryanair will cut 
them a further 20 per cent in the second half to combat passenger lethargy, so full-year profit will be at the low end 
of its earlier EUR200m-EUR300m guidance. Even so, the 5 per cent initial fall in Ryanair's share price yesterday 
reflected concern over the impact of the downturn on the airline's gravity-defying profitability.
The greater fear, however, is what Ryanair's caution spells for the less agile. British Airways' shares also fell ahead 
of first-half results on Friday.
The lossmaking airline's urgent need to shed costs could yet be undermined by a cabin crew strike. Mr O'Leary's 
actions are aimed at boosting profitability; BA's are about survival.
In, out, shake it all about. If only CIT's aim of nipping into bankruptcy, quickly exiting and rejigging its business 
looked as easy. The US trade finance company turned bank goes under having won bondholder approval for a 
prepackaged filing. But its plan to shrink and regroup around its Utah bank subsidiary is reliant on the blessing of 
regulators - among them, the regulators that declined to come to CIT's aid earlier this year.
Ryanair
Although some angst is inevitable over the probable loss of the Treasury's $2.3bn investment in the company, the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - which denied CIT access to its debt guarantee programme in July - 
deserves credit for not throwing good money after bad. Markets brushed off news of the $70bn bankruptcy 
yesterday. The retailers that rely on CIT's credit have now had months to prepare for its demise. Commercial 
business volumes were already barely a third of their 2007 level in the first six months of this year, with further loss 
of business now likely.
CIT faces two main challenges, once a judge gives its plans the nod. The first is to sell assets, reducing its size by, 
perhaps, four-fifths. Expensive emergency funding and an increasingly negative net interest margin provide reason 
to move quickly. More fundamentally, CIT must fund its viable vendor finance business with low-cost deposits. The 
FDIC has, rightly, stepped in to halt rapid growth in flighty deposits supplied by brokerage companies beyond a cap 
of $5.5bn. But the company does not have the branch network, internet platform and retail banking expertise to 
gather deposits and reinvent the business. And that's what it's all about.
There's volatile, and there's ChiNext. All 28 debutants on Shenzhen's new board for growth stocks tripped multiple 
circuit-breakers on Friday, some more than doubling. Yesterday, two-thirds of them did so in the other direction, 
tumbling more than 10 per cent. Beijing-based Huayi Brothers, China's largest film studio, was typical - up 147 per 
cent, down 11 per cent. If the Shanghai Stock Exchange is a bit of a casino, then the new junior board looks like it 
will be a back-alley cockfight.
Growth markets often falter: remember Easdaq or Germany's Neuer Markt? Successful venues can take years to 
develop a full spectrum of issuers, from main market proxies (low volatility, high volumes, analyst coverage) at one 
end, to striplings barely out of venture capital at the other. But the omens are not encouraging for China's new 
bourse. Growth markets need patient, long-term investors. And ChiNext is as short of those as its seniors in 
Shanghai and Shenzhen. On CLSA estimates, about a fifth of the capitalisation of the mainland markets is publicly 
accounted for, held by local and foreign institutions. The remainder is owned by flighty retail investors and shadowy 
government-linked bodies, whose investment objectives are anyone's guess. Growth markets also need 
unhysterical valuations. At the close, the average trailing price/earnings ratio of ChiNext constituents is 71 - more 
than double that of the Shanghai benchmark and more than triple the S&P 500's.
The rationale for ChiNext remains sound. The world's leading capital markets - London, New York, Tokyo - are 
multi-tiered. China's start-ups have struggled for access to equity capital. A reliable outlet for growth stocks also 
draws in more private equity money to back listable candidates. But note the key word, "reliable". ChiNext is 
anything but.
Gordon Brown certainly has chutzpah. Claiming credit for introducing fresh competition into the banking sector is as 
preposterous as asserting that Britain was "best placed" to weather the recession. UK consumers have to thank 
Neelie Kroes, European Union competition commissioner, not the government. Even investors with the shortest 
memories can recall that the Treasury blessed both banks' recovery plans in February and that the prime minister 
not only brokered Lloyds' merger with Halifax Bank of Scotland but also threw in a waiver from competition rules. 
Either way, the news yesterday that RBS must now undertake disposals marks the start in earnest of the 
dismantling of Sir Fred Goodwin's empire.
The recovery plan that Stephen Hester, RBS's chief executive, outlined in February is now being rewritten by 
Brussels. The forced sale of RBS's insurance businesses and 300 or so former Williams & Glyn's branches, along 
with further shrinkage of global banking and markets assets, will leave RBS's funded balance sheet (excluding 
derivatives) more than 40 per cent smaller than at its peak.
The revised terms of RBS's participation in the government's asset protection scheme give it flexibility to benefit 
from improving market conditions. The government receives the same number of B-shares as before, taking its 
economic interest to 84 per cent. But instead of forgoing £9bn-£11bn of deferred tax assets, RBS will purchase the 
insurance on a pay-as-you-go basis, with an annual fee of about £1bn. The government will then be on the hook for 
90 per cent of losses on perhaps £280bn of assets, down from £325bn previously, but only after RBS has absorbed 
Ryanair
a much higher first loss. Originally set at £19.5bn, this jumps to £37.5bn, or £60bn including the £23bn hit already 
recorded. End of empire is always a muddy, bloody business.

Ryanair blames Boeing for threat of 'divorce'

Senior management changes and "internal turmoil" at Boeing have made it impossible to get important decisions 
out of the US aircraft maker, one of its biggest customers claimed yesterday.
Michael O'Leary, the outspoken chief executive of Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, said talks with Boeing 
on up to 200 new 737-800 jets were going nowhere, even though the price gap between the two sides was "very 
small".
He repeated an earlier threat that if no deal was reached before the end of this year he would end Ryanair's long 
relationship with Boeing and start talks with Airbus, the US manufacturer's European rival.
Ryanair, which operates a fleet made up of 202 Boeing 737s, has in recent years become one the US aerospace 
group's largest customers, taking delivery of 91 aircraft since mid-2007.
"The difficulty has just been in getting someone in Boeing to make a decision," Mr O'Leary said. "Boeing seem to 
have a degree of internal turmoil."
The company recently replaced Scott Carson, the head of its commercial aeroplanes division, with Jim Albaugh, 
following lengthy delays in its 787 Dreamliner programme.
Mr O'Leary claimed it was taking Mr Albaugh "a while to read into the business" and criticised the size of Boeing's 
leadership team, which he said was made up of about 70 people. "Seventy people could never make a decision 
about anything," he said.
Mr O'Leary has not met Mr Albaugh and does not speak warmly of his last encounter with Mr Carson.
"The last time I met Scott Carson I got a 45-minute briefing on how the 787 was coming along," he told the 
Financial Times in a recent interview. "I said, 'I'm not interested in your 787s, we want 737s. You're not selling any 
aircraft, so why don't you sell me some?' "
Ryanair blames Boeing for threat of 'divorce'
Boeing said yesterday it did not comment on customer discussions.
Analysts have been sceptical about Mr O'Leary's threats to "divorce" Boeing, as well as his warnings that he might 
rein in growth altogether after 2012 if the Boeing deal fails, and start delivering dividends to shareholders.
Airbus has shown no signs of wishing to engage in talks with Ryanair. Boeing's European rival publicly snubbed Mr 
O'Leary the last time he tried to draw it into a bidding contest with Boeing. This year it said it was "not in discussions 
with Ryanair", a position it reiterated last week.
One of the main reasons Ryanair has kept its costs down to such competitive levels is its decision to stick to just 
one type of aircraft.
Mr O'Leary was speaking as Ryanair announced second-quarter pre-tax profits of EUR284.8m ($421.7m), a gain it 
said was primarily due to a 42 per cent fall in fuel costs. Its shares slid 1.8 per cent to EUR2.90 in Dublin.

If Ryanair really did stop growing after 2012, as Michael O'Leary, its loquacious chief executive, has threatened, it 
would be a striking change for investors who have followed the business since its flotation in 1997, writes Pilita 
Clark.
It would be even more striking for those who witnessed the airline's earliest beginnings in 1985, when it had one 15-
seat aircraft flying daily between Ireland and England that was so small its cabin crew could be no taller than 5ft 2in.
By the time Mr O'Leary became chief executive in 1994, Ryanair had 1.6m passengers and a staff of 523, but was 
hardly a financial success.
An extraordinary growth spurt changed that. All through the rest of that decade and the next, each year saw the 
airline add another batch of routes, first in the UK then Europe, and eventually north Africa.
Having modelled itself on the highly successful US Southwest airline, Ryanair was keen to create a fleet of just one 
type of aircraft - enabling it to keep costs down by not having to have more than one set of engineers or crew.
It followed Southwest into the arms of Boeing, and for the past two years has taken more deliveries of Boeing jets 
than Southwest - 91 against Southwest's 24. It has a fleet of 202 aircraft, making it one of Boeing's best customers.
By the mid to late 2000s, Ryanair had earned a number of enviable tags, including that of one of the world's most 
profitable airlines. At one point earlier this year, it was the most valuable carrier in the world by market capitalisation 
after Singapore Airlines.
Today it operates across 26 countries connecting 151 destinations with a staff of more than 7,000. It expects to 
carry 66m passengers this year.
It is Europe's biggest short-haul carrier, bigger than British Airways and even Air France/KLM and Germany's 
Lufthansa.
There is still more to come: some time next year, it expects to carry more passengers in the UK than BA. After that, 
it is on track to become the number one airline, by passenger numbers, in Italy and Spain as well.

Volatility returned to the Irish banking sector yesterday on concerns that a bill to establish a "bad bank" for toxic 
loans was making slower progress in parliament than expected.
While the minister in charge of co-ordinating voting said on Sunday that he hoped parliament would be able to pass 
the bill by November 12, the bill would still need the signature of President Mary McAleese and perhaps the 
approval of the Supreme Court.
Separately, Irish banks have been hit by concerns that they could face increased regulation from the European 
Union. Shares in Allied Irish Banks plunged 9.9 per cent to EUR1.69 while Bank of Ireland fell 5.9 per cent to 
EUR1.60. Greek banks were also weaker after the country's central bank raised doubts about the sector's credit 
risk provision. While the nation's banks have doubled their provision against non-performing loans, George 
Provopoulos, Bank of Greece governor, said the banks remained at risk due to the downturn in Greece and 
southeast Europe, where several Greek banks have expanded.
The Bank of Greece fell 2.4 per cent to EUR49.43, Piraeus Bank lost 4.6 per cent to EUR11.30, Alpha Bank was 
down 3.7 per cent to EUR12.80 and the National Bank of Greece was 2.3 per cent weaker at EUR24.70.
In the wider market, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.4 per cent to 980.28 after posting heavy losses last week. In 
Frankfurt the Xetra Dax rose 0.3 per cent to 5,430.82. The CAC 40 in Paris rose 0.9 per cent to 3,639.46.
In the travel sector, Ryanair was down 1.8 per cent to EUR2.90 after Michael O'Leary, chief executive, warned that 
growth could stagnate by 2012. While the Irish airline's adjusted net profit jumped 80 per cent in the first half, the 
company admitted that the rise was partially attributable to cheaper fuel costs, which fell 42 per cent during the 
same period.
Ryanair also said it could distribute cash to shareholders instead of buying new Boeing aircraft.

Ryanair threatens to cease growth

News analysis
The airline may stop expanding if it does not reach a deal with Boeing, says Pilita Clark
Body
One of the first things a visitor to Ryanair's Dublin headquarters sees in the entry foyer is a framed model of one of 
the Boeing 737-800 jets that have long been the only type of aircraft in the low-cost airline's fleet.
A plaque beneath says the model was a gift from Alan Mulally, former head of Boeing's commercial airplanes 
division, to Ryanair's Michael O'Leary for the purpose of "celebrating the Boeing and Ryanair partnership" in 2002.
The problems that the aviation industry faced that year - and their consequences - help to explain why Mr O'Leary 
was busy telling everyone at Ryanair's second-quarter results presentations yesterday that he might have to rein in 
growth at his aggressively expansionist company after 2012.
In 2002 the sector was facing a recession in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Manufacturers were eager to 
sell aircraft and Mr O'Leary got what he later boasted were "rapacious" discounts on an order for 100 Boeing 737-
800s, with options for another 50.
Today, the industry is in crisis again and Mr O'Leary has been trying to exploit it by getting Boeing to sell him more 
aircraft, this time up to 200 jets.
But Boeing is showing signs of reluctance.
Mr O'Leary has, in turn, started saying he is prepared to "divorce" the US manufacturer and start talking to its 
European rivals at Airbus.
Airbus has shown a distinct disinclination to engage with Ryanair, however, and that in turn has led Mr O'Leary to 
warn that he might stop growing Ryanair altogether.
Ryanair threatens to cease growth
"If we don't get a deal with Boeing before the end of the year we're going to cut back the growth rate between now 
and 2012, through some cancellations, some deferrals and begin to run the business from 2012 for maximised 
profits . . . distribute cash out to shareholders," he said.
Seasoned Ryanair watchers say this is all simply another piece of bluster from Mr O'Leary.
It is true that his predictions can sometimes go awry: he said in 2005 he would retire by 2008 and now says he will 
go "in the next two or three years".
Some say his latest threats are borne of weakness. Paul Leighton, managing director of the UK-based Aircraft 
Value Analysis Company, which appraises aircraft values for airlines, says that despite the general aviation 
recession, market conditions for manufacturers such as Boeing are much better today than they were in 2002 
because order backlogs are so much larger. Boeing's backlog of 737 jets was 2,118 at the end of September this 
year, according to the company website, most of them for the 737-800's that Ryanair buys.
Mr Leighton points out that part of the reason for Mr O'Leary's success has been his ability to keep down 
maintenance costs with a young fleet. But that puts pressure on the airline to find replacements. "Ryanair have 
really got to think about replacing aircraft, not just growth strategy, so perhaps their position isn't as strong as they 
would like to make out," he said.
If Ryanair were to go "ex-growth", its reputation for low fares could be at risk.
By putting a stop to growth, Ryanair would be under less pressure to fill new seats, so there would be less need for 
eye-catching promotions and average fares could rise.
Analysts were divided yesterday about whether Mr O'Leary would put the strategy into practice. Bears said Mr 
O'Leary needed an excuse for the reality that the airline had reached the limits of expansion and had to stop 
growing. Bulls argued he only had 10 per cent of the European market and still had plenty of room to grow.
The latter camp pointed to the results Ryanair produced yesterday: although first-half sales fell 2 per cent to 
EUR1.77bn (£1.58bn), pre-tax profits rose from EUR105m to EUR419m, due to lower fuel costs and the absence of 
last year's EUR94m impairment charge. The results missed some of the more optimistic forecasts, but the overall 
picture is still impressive in a downturn that has left airlines struggling round the world.
Nevertheless, the prospect of Ryanair ending its years of high growth has excited its rivals.
"I have been telling everyone that would listen for the past year that this do-or-die mission O'Leary is on to buy 
more and more aircraft will end up in tears for his shareholders," said EasyJet founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou.
"My suggestion now, as he will not find enough passengers to fill his 100 additional aircraft, is to buy a piece of the 
Mojave Desert in California and start an aviation museum for his old aircraft. It could be another ancillary revenue 
stream idea for him alongside his charging for the loo."

Budget carrier Ryanair PLC on Monday reported that second-quarter profit rose 35 percent as cost cuts helped 
offset a 4 percent drop in revenue.
For the three months ending Sept. 30, Ryanair reported a net profit of &#8264;million ($370 million), compared to 
&#8264;million a year earlier. Revenue fell to &#8264;llion from &#8264;illion.
The airline cut operating expenses by 16 percent to &#8264;llion pounds, including a &#8264;llion reduction in fuel 
costs.
Still, Ryanair shares fell Monday after Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the company might rein in expansion 
plans if it cannot extract concessions from Boeing for the purchase of 200 aircraft between 2013 and 2016.
"We see no point in continuing to grow rapidly in a declining yield environment, where our main aircraft partner is 
unwilling to play its part in our cost reduction program by passing on some of the enormous savings which Boeing 
have enjoyed both from suppliers and more efficient manufacturing in recent years," O'Leary said.
"We would prefer to grow, but if Boeing doesn't share our vision, then I believe that Ryanair should change course 
before the end of this fiscal year and manage the airline over the next three years to maximize cash for distribution 
to shareholders."
Ryanair shares were down 5.9 percent at &#8264;n the London Stock Exchange.
For the six months ending Sept. 30, the company reported a net profit of &#8264;million, compared to &#8264;illion 
a year earlier. The year ago results were hit by exceptional charges of &#8264;million, compared to exceptionals of 
&#8264;illion in the recent half.
Traffic rose 15 percent to 36 million passengers for the half-year, the company said.
Gert Zonneveld, analyst at Panmure Gordon & Co., said he believed Ryanair shares were undervalued "given 
Ryanair's proven ability to generate strong growth at superior margins," but cautiously kept his rating at hold.
Ryanair Q2 profit up 35 percent
"Near term market uncertainty, however, is likely to remain and it is unclear how long it might take for the aviation 
markets to recover," he said.

Ryanair sent a fresh warning to planemaker Boeing over a large order, saying it could curb its once unstoppable 
growth as limits emerge in its quest for cutting costs.
Ryanair, already close to being Europe's biggest airline, said it still saw "massive" expansion opportunities, but 
analysts said it could not sustain a 15 percent annual rate of traffic growth without cutting fares too low to make 
money.
"It's difficult to see how they can keep squeezing costs out of the business," said Panmure Gordon analyst Gert 
Zonneveld. "At the end of the day, you need your two pilots, you need a number of crew per aircraft."
Shares in Ryanair fell 4 percent after it failed to meet expectations it would raise its full-year outlook and as an 80 
percent rise in first-half profit owed much to cheaper fuel and belied falling fares and revenue. Ryanair said talks 
with Boeing on ordering 200 aircraft for 2013-16 delivery had not progressed much, adding it could end its 
traditional relationship with the U.S. aircraft maker. "We see no point in continuing to grow rapidly in a declining 
yield environment, where our main aircraft partner is unwilling to play its part in our cost reduction programme," 
chief executive Michael O'Leary said. "If we cannot invest our surplus cash efficiently in new aircraft, then we 
should distribute it to shareholders," said O'Leary, who has so far stuck to building Ryanair's 2.5 billion euro cash 
pile further without paying any dividends. O'Leary, renowned in the industry for driving hard bargains, famously 
placed a massive order for 100 new Boeing aircraft and options on 50 more at rock bottom prices in the wake of the 
Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. "I still believe that they are very keen to buy new aircraft," the Dublin-based 
trader said. "I don't interpret what is happening as a dramatic change in their strategy yet". O'Leary, who has said 
Ryanair could stop growing beyond 2012 if no deal was reached with Boeing, has been hinting for months he would 
be prepared to switch allegiance to Airbus. Ryanair, which has thrived on consumers trading down in the recession, 
said it was still winning substantial market share from major flag carriers Air France-KLM, British Airways and

there is another strategy which they can comfortably pursue for quite a few years which does not require another 
big deal with Boeing or Airbus," Zonneveld said. Ryanair said first-half profit was boosted by a 42-percent fall in fuel 
costs and concealed a 17-percent decline in fares which was set to accelerate to 20 percent in the second half. 
Ryanair expects to make a loss in the third and fourth quarters of the 2009/10 fiscal year, though affirmed its 
forecast for full-year net profit at the lower end of a 200 million to 300 million euro range. "The market expectations 
had been considerably higher than that," one Dublin-based trader said. Ryanair, which has mounted two 
unsuccessful hostile bids for Aer Lingus, reiterated it was unlikely to make a third bid but it would respond positively 
if - as it expects - the government asked it to bail out the loss-making Irish rival. Ryanair's net profit before 
exceptional items in the six months to the end of September came in at 387 million euros, compared with a forecast 
of 377 million euros by Ryanair's house brokers Davy. Revenue fell 2 percent in the first half to 1.77 billion euros as 
the decline in fares outweighed a 15 percent growth in traffic.

Irish airline Ryanair has posted an 80 pc rise in first-half profit, but has repeated that it could reverse its long-
standing strategy of rapid growth and distribute cash to shareholders instead.
The airline, which has thrived on consumers trading down in the recession, said it was still winning substantial 
market share from major flag carriers Air France-KLM, British Airways and Deutsche Lufthansa.
But it said its first half profit rise had been helped by a 42 pc fall in fuel costs and masked a 17 percent decline in 
fares, with that fall in ticket prices set to accelerate in the second half.
Ryanair expects fares to decline by up to 20 pc in the last two quarters of its 2009/10 fiscal year, making each of 
those quarters loss-making, but affirmed its forecast for full-year net profit at the lower end of a 200 - 300m euro 
range. Europe's biggest budget carrier said its talks with Boeing on an order for 200 aircraft had not progressed 
much, adding it could end its traditional relationship with the aircraft maker. "We see no point in continuing to grow 
rapidly in a declining yield environment, where our main aircraft partner is unwilling to play its part in our cost

The Dublin shares market headed lower as AIB lost 12pc in value amid continued concern over the slow progress 
through the Dail of the Government's E54 billion NAMA scheme and Ryanair shares fell steeply after it warned on 
profits.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 16.70 points to 2,849.99.
'It's the same old story of the dragging on of the Nama (debate) and the weakness of the Irish economy,' a Dublin-
based trader said. On October 29th, AIB chairman Dan O'Connor said the bank could face "serious consequences" 
from its negotiations with Europe. The bank has already received E3.5 billion from the Government. "The threat of 
more significant EC requirements" may make it more difficult for Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish "to raise equity until 
there is further clarity on the ultimate outcome of its decisions," Anna Lalor, analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers in 
Dublin, wrote in a broker's note today. The Government expects a law to establish the National Asset Management 
agency to be passed by the Dail on November 12th, Department of Finance sources have said. The recent fall in 
Irish bank shares has been attributed to the Bill's slow progress through the Oireachtas. Committee stage was 
completed last week after a marathon debate.
Bank of Ireland stocks dropped by 1c to E1.69 while Irish Life and Permanent - which has no direct involvement in 
NAMA - rose by 6c to E4.99. Elsewhere, shares in Ryanair plunged by 15c to E2.80 after it posted an 80pc rise in 
first-half profit but warned that full year profits will be adversely affected by the fall in passenger traffic. The 
company said fiscal second-quarter profit rose 35pc as the company spent less on fuel. Net income in the three 
months ended September 30th increased to E250.5 million from E185.8 million a year earlier, the Dublin-based 
carrier said in a statement. Sales fell 4pc to E992.1 million, however, and Ryanair said it might throttle back on the 
expansion strategy, warning that the 80pc rise in first-half profit was driven by lower oil prices and masked falling

fares. Shares in Aer Lingus were down 5c to E0.52. Bank of Ireland reports its first-half results to end-September on 
Wednesday. Davy are forecasting a pre-exceptional pre-tax loss of E1.075bn as operating profits of E750m and 
associates of E25m are dwarfed by impairment losses of E1.85bn. In its interim management statement in mid-
September, the bank predicted that operating profits would be lower in the first half of this year as income falls by a 
'mid-teens' percentage and costs by a 'high-single-digit' percentage. Davy's forecast 22pc fall in operating profits 
assumes a 16pc decline in income and a 9pc decrease in costs. The broker's impairment forecast of E1.85bn 
(compared with guidance of E1.6-1.8bn) is equivalent to 283bps (annualised) of average loans and assumes the 
first half charge will represent the peak of the downturn. Shares in Dragon Oil jumped by 31c to E4.94 after it 
confirmed that it has agreed to be bought by majority shareholder Emirates National Oil Co for around £2.4bn. 
Under the terms of the takeover Emirates National Oil Co, which has a 51pc stake holding in Dragon Oil, has 
agreed to pay 455p a share in cash. Commenting on the acquisition, Dubai based ENOC said the deal "significantly 
improves operational flexibility and supports ENOC's strategy of growing the current business in the Middle East 
and in Turkmenistan." Dragon Oil said it "considers the terms of the acquisition to be fair and reasonable." At 455p 
a share, that's an 11pc premium to the price at the close of trading on Friday.

The Dublin shares market see-sawed in an out of the red today as AIB lost 10pc in value amid continued concern 
over the slow progress through the Dail of the Government's E54 billion NAMA scheme and Ryanair shares fell 
steeply after it warned on profits.
"It's the same old story of the dragging on of the Nama (debate) and the weakness of the Irish economy," a Dublin-
based trader said. Last week, AIB chairman Dan O'Connor said the bank could face "serious consequences" from 
its negotiations with Europe. The bank has already received E3.5 billion from the Government. "The threat of more 
significant EC requirements" may make it more difficult for Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish "to raise equity until there 
is further clarity on the ultimate outcome of its decisions," Anna Lalor, analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers, wrote in a 
broker's note.
The Government expects a law to establish the National Asset Management agency to be passed by the Dail on 
November 12th, Department of Finance sources have said. The recent fall in Irish bank shares has been attributed 
to the Bill's slow progress through the Oireachtas. Committee stage was completed last week after a marathon 
debate.
AIB shares fell 19c to E1.69, Bank of Ireland stocks dropped by 10c to E1.60 while Irish Life and Permanent - which 
has no direct involvement in NAMA - rose by 31c to E5.24. Elsewhere, shares in Ryanair fell 5c to E2.90 after it 
posted an 80pc rise in first-half profit but warned that full year profits will be adversely affected by the fall in 
passenger traffic. The company said fiscal second-quarter profit rose 35pc as the company spent less on fuel. Net 
income in the three months ended September 30th increased to E250.5 million from E185.8 million a year earlier, 
the Dublin-based carrier said in a statement. Sales fell 4pc to E992.1 million, however, and Ryanair said it might 
throttle back on the expansion strategy, warning that the 80pc rise in first-half profit was driven by lower oil prices

and masked falling fares. Shares in Aer Lingus were down 5c to E0.52. Bank of Ireland reports its first-half results 
to end-September on Wednesday. Davy are forecasting a pre-exceptional pre-tax loss of E1.075bn as operating 
profits of E750m and associates of E25m are dwarfed by impairment losses of E1.85bn. In its interim management 
statement in mid-September, the bank predicted that operating profits would be lower in the first half of this year as 
income falls by a 'mid-teens' percentage and costs by a 'high-single-digit' percentage. Davy's forecast 22pc fall in 
operating profits assumes a 16pc decline in income and a 9pc decrease in costs. The broker's impairment forecast 
of E1.85bn (compared with guidance of E1.6-1.8bn) is equivalent to 283bps (annualised) of average loans and 
assumes the first half charge will represent the peak of the downturn. Shares in Dragon Oil jumped by 32c to E4.95 
after it confirmed that it has agreed to be bought by majority shareholder Emirates National Oil Co for around 
£2.4bn. Under the terms of the takeover Emirates National Oil Co, which has a 51pc stake holding in Dragon Oil, 
has agreed to pay 455p a share in cash. Commenting on the acquisition, Dubai based ENOC said the deal 
"significantly improves operational flexibility and supports ENOC's strategy of growing the current business in the 
Middle East and in Turkmenistan." Dragon Oil said it "considers the terms of the acquisition to be fair and 
reasonable." At 455p a share, that's an 11pc premium to the price at the close of trading on Friday.

(RTTNews) - European fares airline, Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY), reported significantly higher profit for its half 
year, driven primarily by a 42% decrease in fuel costs, partially offset by a 17% decline in average fares. The 
company foresees loss for the forthcoming quarters of the ongoing fiscal, yet confirmed its profit view. Further, the 
group said there is little progress in its discussions with Boeing for an order of 200 aircraft for delivery between 
2013 and 2016.
The Ireland-based group reported higher half-year Profit before tax of EUR 419.4 million versus EUR 105.2 million 
last year.
Ryanair&apos;s profit attributable to equity holders of parent grew to EUR 373.5 million or 25.21 cents per share 
from EUR 95.3 million or 6.41 cents per share. Excluding an impairment of EUR 13.5 million on Aer Lingus 
shareholding, profit rose to EUR 387 million or 26.13 cents per share from EUR 314.6 million or 14.43 cents per 
share a year ago.
Total operating revenues from continuing operations declined 2% to EUR 1.77 billion from EUR 1.81 billion in the 
comparable period, as average fares fell by 17% due to the recession, price promotions and adverse euro/sterling 
exchange translations. Operating margin climbed 13 points to 26%.
Decline in scheduled revenues outweighed the growth in ancillary revenues. Scheduled revenues declined to EUR 
1.42 billion from EUR 1.48 billion, driven by dip in average fares, price promotions, lower baggage penetration rates 
and adverse exchange rate translations. Ancillary revenues grew by 8% to EUR 346.3 million from EUR 322.1 
million. Ancillary revenues were lower than the increase in passenger volumes, as average spend per passenger 
fell on reduced excess baggage revenues and negative impact of the movement in euro/sterling exchange rates.
Traffic grew by 15% to 36.4 million from 31.6 million, however total revenue per passenger declined 15%, as 
ancillary revenues and average fares fell, whilst Load Factor remained flat at 85% during the period.
Fuel contributed to 35% of the total operating costs. Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 5% and including fuel they fell 
by 27%. During the period under review, total operating expenses decreased by 17% primarily due to lower fuel 
prices, offset by the higher level of activity and increased operating costs associated with the growth of the airline.
Ryanair H1 Profit Surges; Sees Loss In Q3, Q4; Yet Reaffirms Full Year Earnings View - Update
Maintenance costs, aircraft rental costs, route charges and airport and handling charges rose 32%, 18%, 15% and 
5%, respectively, year-over-year. This reflects on expansion in leased air-fleet, increased passenger volumes, 
higher number of sectors flown and an increase in average unit rates.
Looking ahead to the forthcoming third and fourth quarters, the group expects to make loss as average fares are 
anticipated to decline further by up to 20%. However, the group reaffirmed its full year net profit forecast range at 
the lower end of EUR 200 million to EUR 300 million. On average, three analysts polled by Thomson Reuters 
expect earnings per share of $1.78, for the fiscal. Analysts&apos; estimates typically exclude special items.
Boeing Talks Inconclusive?
Ryanair also said in its report that it made little progress in discussions with Boeing (BA) for an order of 200 aircraft 
for delivery between 2013 and 2016. If discussions continued to be inconclusive by year-end, then Ryanair will end 
its relationship with Boeing and confirm a series of order deferrals and cancellations.
Michael O&apos;Leary, Ryanair&apos;s CEO commented "We see no point in continuing to grow rapidly in a 
declining yield environment, where our main aircraft partner is unwilling to play its part in our cost reduction 
programme by passing on some of the enormous savings which Boeing have enjoyed both from suppliers and more 
efficient manufacturing in recent years."
Friday, RYAAY closed regular trading at $27.27, on the Nasdaq and BA finished at $47.80, on the NYSE.

TODAY
  Ryanair , Europe's biggest no-frills carrier, kicks off another week of airline results with a contrasting story to that 
of British Airways , which follows on Friday, writes Pilita Clark .
The Irish company will announce figures for the busy summer months of the second quarter in which it traditionally 
generates most of its profits. Analysts are expecting an increase in first-half net profits, with estimates ranging 
around EUR390m (excluding exceptionals), mainly because of a fall in fuel costs from the same period a year 
earlier. Ryanair has been saying it expects full-year net income of about EUR200m and is expected to emphasise 
the danger of higher fuel costs and weak yields ahead in winter.
BA faces the same oil-price-rise threat, tempered by a recovering global economy, as it reports second-quarter 
results. It has warned of the largest loss in its history this year, more than last year's pre-tax loss of £401m.
Investors will be seeking assurances that the threat of pre-Christmas strikes by cabin crew is not damaging forward 
bookings, and will be keen to hear about the airline's long-term strategic aims.

  Analysts will be scouring UBS 's third-quarter results for signs of recovery in its core private banking business, 
which suffered unprecedented outflows amid a tax investigation by US investigators, writes Megan Murphy .
Corporate diary
No one expects a miraculous turnround, but evidence that the bank has stemmed withdrawals, particularly in the 
US and among offshore clients, would be welcomed by investors. UBS last week named Robert "Bob" McCann, the 
former head of Merrill Lynch's wealth management division, to help rebuild its US private banking operations.
Analysts will be looking to see how settling its dispute with the Internal Revenue Service by agreeing to hand over 
the names of thousands of account holders has affected the business.
On the investment banking side, it is unlikely that UBS will be able to match the strong results posted by European 
competitors following the departure of numerous senior executives in crucial areas.

  A clearer view of Chrysler 's future will emerge when Sergio Marchionne, chief executive of Italy's Fiat, unveils his 
long-term strategy for the US carmaker,  writes Bernard Simon . Fiat took operational control of the Detroit 
company and acquired a 20 per cent equity stake as part of Chrysler's US government-backed restructuring in the 
summer.
Mr Marchionne has shaken up the senior management ranks in Detroit, hived off the Dodge Ram pick-up truck - 
Chrysler's top-selling vehicle - into a separate division, begun a search for a fresh advertising agency, and raised 
the profile of Mopar, Chrysler's often overlooked but well-respected parts and accessories operation.
Wednesday's briefing will focus on a reconfiguration of Chrysler's product line-up aimed at making it less dependent 
on pick-ups, sports-utility vehicles and minivans. Several Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep models will be dropped. New 
models are expected to include Fiat's small 500 car and an Alfa Romeo SUV.

  The central question surrounding Cable & Wireless's interim results is whether its plan to demerge the business - 
put on hold a year ago amid volatile equity markets - is back on the agenda, writes Philip Stafford .
C&W's consumer-focused international arm is seen as a cash cow, while the rest of the group, which relies on sales 
to companies in the UK, has seen revenues grow but struggled to become cash-flow positive.
Corporate diary
Analyst consensus is for the UK's second-largest telecommunications company to report interim revenues of 
£1.9bn and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of £460m, compared with turnover of 
£1.6bn and ebitda of £357m a year ago. C&W has indicated that ebitda for the year would be just over £1bn, based 
on an exchange rate of £1:$1.50.
  Analysts will be looking for underlying revenue growth of about 3 per cent when Unilever reports third-quarter 
earnings, writes Jenny Wiggins .
The Anglo-Dutch multinational has been performing strongly this year under the leadership of Paul Polman, the new 
chief executive, with its shares rising 37 per cent during the past six months.
Analysts say Unilever is likely to keep improving sales volumes - which were higher in Europe last quarter for the 
first time in more than a year - and also believe it will benefit from falling commodity costs, which have retreated 
from last year's highs.
This will help Unilever keep prices flat, making its home and personal care products more competitive.

Budget carrier Ryanair on Monday reported that first-half profit more than trebled, despite a 2 percent drop in 
revenue, as it booked fewer one-time charges than last year.
For the six months ending Sept. 30, the company reported a net profit of &#8264;million ($552.78 million), 
compared to &#8264;illion a year earlier. The year-ago results were hit by exceptional charges of &#8264;million, 
compared to charges of &#8264;illion in this year's period.
Revenue from continuing operations was &#8264;illion, down from &#8264;illion a year earlier.
Traffic rose 15 percent to 36 million passengers, the company said.

Highlight: 2012 target date for 90m passengers a year
O'Leary says no need to secure Boeing deal
Body
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has given the strongest indication yet that the airline may stop growing 
after 2012, when it is set to hit its target of flying 90m passengers a year.
Speaking to the Financial Times before today's interim results, he said Ryanair did not need to secure a deal with 
Boeing for more aircraft - and could instead shift to a strategy of rationalising routes, building up cash and paying 
dividends to shareholders.
Mr O'Leary is currently in discussions with Boeing to order up to 200 aircraft. Some analysts think that he may be 
ready to announce a deal with Boeing at today's results presentation. However, others point out that recession-hit 
airlines have been deferring aircraft deliveries - Lufthansa and AirAsia being the latest examples, last week.
But Mr O'Leary also claims that the low-cost airline may not need any new aircraft to achieve its target of 90m 
passengers in three years - up from this year's target of 66m. "If we order no more aircraft the fleet will be at 300 
aircraft by 2012," Mr O'Leary added. "We may not grow at all after 2012."
A strategy of standing still would be good for Ryanair, he claimed. "It would allow us to weed out some of the poorer 
routes, some of the poorer aircraft bases, and switch those aircraft to new opportunities, while building up cash and 
distributing some money to shareholders."
Nevertheless, shareholders and analysts have expressed concern about a change from being an out-and-out 
growth stock into an income stock.
Joe Gill, director of equity research at Bloxham stockbrokers in Dublin, warned that shareholders would consider 
such a move premature.
"They are investors in the business as a growth model," he said."They hadn't built into their expectations that he 
would stop growing in 2012."

Ryanair , Europe's biggest no-frills carrier, today kicks off another week of airline results with a contrasting story to 
that of British Airway s, which follows on Friday , writes Pilita Clark .
The Irish company will announce figures for the busy summer months of the second quarter in which it traditionally 
generates most of its profits. Analysts are expecting an increase in first-half net profits, with estimates ranged 
around EUR390m (excluding exceptionals), mainly because of a fall in fuel costs from the same period a year 
earlier. Ryanair has been saying it expects full-year net income of about EUR200m and is expected to emphasise 
the danger of higher fuel costs and weak yields ahead in winter.
BA faces the same oil-price-rise threat, tempered by a recovering global economy, as it reports second-quarter 
results. It has warned of the largest loss in its history this year, bigger than last year's pre-tax loss of £401m.
Investors will be seeking assurances that the threat of pre-Christmas strikes by cabin crew is not damaging forward 
bookings, and will be keen to hear about the airline's long-term strategic aims.

Budget airline Ryanair may halt the aggressive growth plans that have allowed it to branch out to 26 countries, as 
stalled discussions over an order of aircraft mean it will plough its rising profits elsewhere.
While reporting an 80% rise in half-year profits to 387 million helped by a 42% fall in fuel costs chief executive 
Michael O'Leary said that if plans for 200 more aircraft from Boeing were not successful, he would 'manage the 
airline over the next three years to maximise cash for distribution to shareholders'.
'If we cannot invest our surplus cash efficiently in new aircraft, then we should distribute it to shareholders,' O'Leary 
said, while adding that the airline would prefer to grow if possible.
The average fare charged by the airline fell by 17% to 39 in the first half of the year. The group expects a further 
20% fall in the second half of the year, resulting in losses in the last two quarters.
O'Leary said that an absence of consumer confidence meant that market conditions in Ireland, the UK and Europe 
continued to be difficult.
Shares, which trade on the Irish Stock Exchange, were down 5.76% to 2.80.

BA and Iberia confirm merger

Length: 505 words
Byline: Sophie Segal
Highlight: Two European flag carriers announce their intentions to merge.
Body
Predicting synergies of (EURO)400 million ($595 million), British Airways (BA) and Iberia have signed a 
memorandum of understanding to merge. The airlines will sign the agreement in the first quarter of 2010 and are 
expected to complete the merger by the fourth quarter of 2010.
&
The combined group will have 419 aircraft and fly to 205 destinations. The airlines stated in a presentation that they 
expect 33% synergies.
&
While the operational and financial headquarters will be in London, with registered office in Madrid, each carrier will 
keep their base in their home country as well as their codes and brands.
&
BA's CEO Willie Walsh will become the group CEO and Iberia Antonio Vázquez will be the group's chairman. BA 
shareholders will own 55% of the joint airline and Iberia shareholders will own 45%.
&
Today, Iberia reported a third quarter net loss of (EURO)16 million ($). This is compared with a profit for the same 
period last year of (EURO)30.4 million. The carrier notes in its financial statement that the third quarter was better 
than results in the first half of 2009. Losses for the year through the September stand at (EURO)181.9 million.
&
BA reported a £292 million ($481 million) loss before tax, last week. With revenue down by 13.7%, the airline's 
financial report said the airline was expecting revenue to be £1 billion lower in 2009 compared with 2008.
A convenient marriage
BA and Iberia confirm merger
&
Ian Hosier of Airfinance Advice &#38; Arrangement says: "In particular, the progressive deregulation has enabled 
the so-called low cost carriers to become established, and to challenge the more-monolithic legacy carriers. In the 
US, Southwest and jetBlue have led the way, followed in Europe by Ryanair and easyJet - who have all clearly 
shown that it is possible to offer substantial airline services on a profitable basis."
&
Mergers between flag carriers have been popular in recent years. In 2003 Europeans carriers Air France and KLM 
merged and last year, Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines merged, creating the biggest airline in the world.
&
It is critical to remember that this is still only in the memorandum of understanding stage. Hosier says it will be 
important for management to remain focused on integration and not to get distracted by global aviation issues. BA 
will be keen to keep JAL in the Oneworld alliance for strategic reasons, which will possibly require monetary 
investment. Delta Air Lines has been rumoured to be considering investing in the struggling Japanese carrier in 
order to woo JAL to transfer to Skyteam.
&
Also, BA and American Airlines are still working on getting regulatory clearance from US, UK and EU regulatory 
bodies for a closer linkage.
&
"Overall, this will get done - because the consequences of not doing it are very unattractive to both of them [BA and 
Iberia], because they are already significantly behind Lufthansa and Air France in terms of consolidating and 
building strength in the European airline market." says Hosier. "This is a true marriage of convenience!"

Outsourced hands can make for a lighter workload

Highlight: Business Challenges
Many small and fast-growing businesses are turning to external parties to run some of their non-core operations 
and to reduce costs. Jonathan Moules  reports
Body
Janine Carhart is a truly self-made woman.
Her Essex-based street furniture business Barriers Direct is on track to turnover of £2m this year, supplying 
everything from bollards to bicycle racks to businesses, home owners and local authorities across the country.
However, Carhart is the only person on the payroll because she has handed over everything she feels is not core to 
the operations - from manufacturing to finance and marketing functions - to external suppliers.
"Basically we are an outsourced company," Carhart says, noting that this flexibility allows her not only to undercut 
her rivals by at least 15 per cent, but also to enjoy the freedom to operate from wherever she connects her laptop.
In fact, Carhart spends half of every month operating out of her second home in Sweden. "Wherever I have my 
computer, I can work," she says.
Carhart's focus on getting the maximum bang for her bucks may be influenced by her experiences before taking the 
jump into starting a business - having spent several years with the notoriously cost-concious budget airline Ryanair.
Carhart says she respects the achievements of Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, but stresses that she 
has managed to save her customers' money without the negative commentary her former boss has received.
She is not alone. A number of owners of small, but fast-growing, businesses are now opting to build operations that 
outsource all but the core value-adding service.
Some of this trend is being driven by the recession, as established companies use third parties to help shave costs.
Outsourced hands can make for a lighter workload
Glenda Stone, who chairs the government's female enterprise taskforce, claims to have slashed the overheads on 
her own recruitment marketing business - Aurora - by moving from leased premises in the City to a serviced office 
space in Canary Wharf.
"Everyone is saying, let me be as flexible as possible." she says.
Previously at Canary Wharf, a businesscould not get office space unless it took a whole floor in a building, Stone 
notes.
The recession, however, has changed the landlords' business plans and they have been willing to allow various 
companies to share the space. "It is chock full," Stone says.
Arrangements such as this mean that a business owner can save money while maintaining the flexibility to ramp up 
operations quickly when the upturn finally comes.
Ben Gladstone, whose IT support business Conosco is profiting from this small business outsourcing trend, claims 
that a lot of the interest is coming from budding entrepreneurs who are just starting up.
"There has been a shift in the way people work," he says, noting that starting a business this way enables people to 
launch a company for virtually nothing.
This was the experience of Sherie Griffiths, a former lawyer who launched Savvy Business, an online information 
portal for owner-managers, in May this year, using £10,000 of savings and a £20,000 bank loan.
"I can have access to expertise that a company like mine could never afford," she says.
All Savvy Business' telephone calls, the quarterly communication with its membership base, preparation of monthly 
accounts, the VAT returns, credit control and liaison with suppliers are handled by a third- party supplier: Paper 
Mountain Solutions.
"I do ideas," Griffiths says. "I don't do the systems, structures and other background detail which is essential to 
make those ideas fly."
Colchester-based Paper Mountain is run by Paul Smalley, who claims that he has had more inquiries from 
prospective customers in the past three months than he has had in the past three years of trading.
"There is a huge demand for our service, particularly when people are very cost-focused," Smalley says.
But being a sole director in a completely outsourced company can be a lonely state of affairs, Griffiths admits. In her 
case, being partially sighted, she does at least have the companionship of her guide dog. "I am going to get him his 
own business cards," she jokes.
She also believes that outsourcing to the extent that she has done it so far can only be a temporary arrangement 
and she plans to take matters in-house once the business has reached a certain scale.
One company that has recently pulled back from outsourcing operations is Easypack, a Suffolk-based print and 
packaging company. As part of a new business plan put together last year, the 31-year-old company decided to 
bring a fairly substantial co-packing operation that it was sub-contracting in-house.
"The contract was worth £600,000 and, although we have had to invest and take on two new buildings on 10-year 
leases, we are making 50 per cent gross margin on the work," says Chris Hall, Easypack's managing director.
Hall is now looking to invest in further printing equipment over the next couple of years so that Easypack can bring 
more work in-house.
Outsourced hands can make for a lighter workload
Even Smalley at Paper Mountain admits that ambitious small and medium-sized companies can outgrow the need 
for outsourcing. His business has been operating for only five years but has already seen customers take over 
functions that Paper Mountain used to provide.
Smalley, however, sees this as a positive progression and stresses that he still maintains good relations with those 
that no longer use his services. "I realise that companies get to a certain size and find that outsourcing is just not a 
cost effective solution any more," he says.

No-frills Irish airline, Ryanair, today announced that it will open four new routes to/from Bordeaux starting from the 
middle of December.
The four new routes from Bologna, Brussels (Charleroi), Edinburgh and Porto to Bordeaux will deliver over 200,000 
passengers a year at Bordeaux and will sustain 200 new jobs in the area, the airline said.
Ryanair's Ken O'Toole said: "Ryanair is delighted to join up with Bordeaux Airport to finally bring really low fares, 
competition and choice to consumers. These four new routes from Bologna, Brussels (Charleroi), Edinburgh and 
Porto will mean for the first time that the people of Bordeaux can now avail of Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares, 
with no fuel surcharges guaranteed, to travel all over Europe from December next. Ryanair's partnership with 
Bordeaux will create a flood of new tourists and visitors to the region and we expect to carry 200,000 passengers in 
the first year which should sustain 200 new jobs in the local economy around Bordeaux."

Body
Shares in the three remaining Irish listed banks nose-dived this morning, sending the ISEQ to a five-week low 
below 3,000 amid growing fears that the EU could throw a spanner in the workings of NAMA.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 146.06 points to 2,912.50.
Shares in AIB and Bank of Ireland collapsed this morning as weakness across European financial stocks magnified 
concerns that the EU will block or significantly modify key elements of the Government's NAMA rescue plan.
AIB's stocks were down 35c to E1.75 and BoI fell 38c to E1.82 while Irish Life and Permanent declined by 63c to 
E4.74. Investors bailed out of the stocks amid fears that EU authorities might not allow the Irish Government to use 
of the longer term economic value (LTEV) methodology to calculate how much it will pay the banks for bad debts 
rather than market value of the transferred property loans. This fear stems from the much more stringent than 
expected conditions set by the EU on ING's restructuring. Investors are also worried that the launch of Ireland's 
E54-billion euro "bad bank" could take several more weeks, leaving insufficient time for Bank of Ireland to carry out 
a rights issue this year. They also worry that, if Bank of Ireland and AIB don't go to the market with a rights issue 
now, then the likes of Lloyds Group and HBOS in the Uk will issue massive numbers of shares and saturate the 
market before the Irish have a chance. Elsewhere, the global producer Cemex reported third quarter results slightly 
behind forecasts as construction markets globally remained weak. Revenues of USD4.22bn for the quarter were 
slightly behind the USD4.29bn consensus while earnings per share, at 14c, was 1c light. CRH's stocks plunged by 
100c to E17.30. Shares in Ryanair fell by 9c to E3.02. Davy's forecasts assume second quarter revenue of 
E942.8m, net profit of E240.5m and earnings per share of 16.2c. The key drivers are the 50pc fall in unit fuel year-
on-year and the assumed 18pc drop in unit revenue. Volumes have been strong with 18.5pc passenger growth and 
loads of 88pc for the quarter. The broker's first half net income forecast (pre-exceptional) of E377m assumes a loss

Body
Irish shares dived again this morning, with the ISEQ index dropping back below 3,000.
Banks led the southward plunge for a second day.
Bank of Ireland was 34c lower a short time ago at 186, with AIB down 25c to 185.
Irish Life and Permanent had shed 39c to 498. Overall the ISEQ index was down 133.76 points a short time ago at 
2,924.80. Market puzzlement about the continuing attack on bank shares continues. One explanation yesterday put 
it down to the backlash from EU pressure that has forced Dutch bank ING to split itself in two. This was seen as an 
indication that Brussels is determined to get tough on banks that have been bailed out with public funds. The scale 
of the fall in Irish bank shares means that this is not now being seen as an adequate explanation, particularly as 
Irish Life and Permanent is not participating in NAMA and has received no public funds. Other shares were also 
negative, though less so. CRH was down 99c to 1730 on talk that it may sell its major US arm Allied Building 
Products. Elan was down 9c despite an announcement by it this morning of benefits to Crohn's disease sufferers 
from its drug Tysabri. Ryanair was off by 9c to 301 and bakery group Aryzta was down 10c to 2600.

Irish shares dived again this morning, with the ISEQ index dropping back below 3,000.
Banks led the southward plunge for a second day.
Bank of Ireland was 34c lower a short time ago at 186, with AIB down 25c to 185.
Irish Life and Permanent had shed 39c to 498. Overall the ISEQ index was down 133.76 points a short time ago at 
2,924.80. Market puzzlement about the continuing attack on bank shares continues. One explanation yesterday put 
it down to the backlash from EU pressure that has forced Dutch bank ING to split itself in two. This was seen as an 
indication that Brussels is determined to get tough on banks that have been bailed out with public funds. The scale 
of the fall in Irish bank shares means that this is not now being seen as an adequate explanation, particularly as 
Irish Life and Permanent is not participating in NAMA and has received no public funds. Other shares were also 
negative, though less so. CRH was down 99c to 1730 on talk that it may sell its major US arm Allied Building 
Products. Elan was down 9c despite an announcement by it this morning of benefits to Crohn's disease sufferers 
from its drug Tysabri. Ryanair was off by 9c to 301 and bakery group Aryzta was down 10c to 2600.

Bank shares fell heavily in Dublin this morning as news hit European markets that a major financial player is to split 
itself in two.
Dutch bancassurer ING's decision is seen as a reaction to pressure from Brussels for major changes at banks that 
have received state support.
In Dublin, AIB was down 12c a short time ago at 225, with Bank of Ireland dropping 24c to 221.
Irish Life and Permanent was down 20c at 549. The ISEQ index was off by 15.10 points at 3,078.84. Away from the 
financials, distribution group DCC was off by 21c at 1768, with Ryanair down 6c to 313. There was better news from 
Elan, which bounced by 14c to 367 and from CRH, which was also up 14c to 1839.

Union discontent set to rise this winter

Body
The strikes by the Communication Workers Union are only the biggest in a series of disputes that could lead to 
industrial action in the coming months.
Most are in the communications and transport sector. This reflects the power that trade unions wield in these 
industries because of the immediate impact that strikes have on customers. Threats are currently rarer in sectors 
where strikes would cause less dramatic disruption to clients in the short term, such as manufacturing.
Cabin crew at British Airways have warned of industrial action over plans to cuts jobs and freeze pay. This could 
involve 14,000 members of the Unite union.
Bob Crow, general secretary of the RMT transport union, has warned that the union "will have no hesitation in 
considering a ballot for action" unless Network Rail, which owns the UK's railway network, promises no compulsory 
redundancies to its maintenance workforce of 13,000. The RMT is also planning a ballot of its 10,000 London 
Underground staff, including drivers, for "strike action and action short of a strike" in a dispute over pay. Unite said 
last week it would join the RMT in balloting its LU members after rejecting a pay offer - co-ordinating the timetable 
with its sister union.
FirstGroup, the bus and rail company, is facing strikes today by several thousand drivers over a pay freeze. The 
dispute is organised by Unite.
In Leeds, 600 members of the GMB and Unison unions have been on strike since September 7 over the council's 
pay proposals for its refuse and street cleaning department. The GMB says the proposals will mean pay cuts.
The GMB has also declared "an impasse" in talks with Swissport, the ground handling agent for Ryanair at 
Stansted airport, concerning 90 redundancies.
The union says this, combined with Swissport's plans for a change in shift patterns, could worsen customer service.
But despite the stalemate, the GMB has not yet warned of industrial action.
Union discontent set to rise this winter
These disputes, when combined with the strikes by CWU postal workers, could push up the number of days lost to 
industrial action across the economy in 2009 to above last year's levels. However, even if the postal strikes 
continue, the national annual tally of days foregone this year because of stoppages is likely to remain far below the 
levels of the 1980s and earlier.
Last year, about 750,000 days were lost - an extremely small number by historical standards.

First Gatwick, now Stansted. Yesterday's £1.5bn sale of Gatwick is only the first of three such deals expected in the 
UK over the next two-and-a-half years, writes Pilita Clark .
All have arisen because competition authorities deemed BAA, the country's biggest airport operator, has too much 
market power, an argument airlines and other airport users agree with.
Until yesterday, BAA's seven airports included Heathrow, the country's largest; Gatwick, the second largest; 
Stansted, a big base for Ryanair, Europe's largest no-frills airline; Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and 
Southampton.
In March, after a two-year investigation, the Competition Commission ruled that BAA should sell three airports 
within two years: Gatwick, Stansted and either Glasgow or Edinburgh.
BAA put Gatwick on the block the previous year in an attempt to meet competition concerns. Gatwick was always 
regarded as the most appealing to suitors. It was bigger with broader transport links and a better passenger 
catchment area.
And there was something else: it did not have Michael O'Leary, the outspoken chief executive of Ryanair, a vocal 
critic of BAA's charges and poor services.
As a number of people involved in the Gatwick deal said, Ryanair is an issue for any potential buyer of Stansted. 
"Basically, do you want to be the next object of public ridicule from Michael O'Leary?" said one. "It's an important 
part of due diligence," said another.
BAA this week began appealing against the Competition Commission's March ruling. If it wins, it hopes the 
commission will have to reconsider its whole ruling. If it loses, it hopes the months taken up by the appeal will mean 
it ends up selling Stansted and a Scottish airport in a more amenable economic and financial climate.

Ryanair today called for the break up and selling off to the highest bidder of the Dublin Airport "monopoly" after 
news of the sale of Gatwick Airport for £1.5bn.
Gatwick is being sold to Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), the owner of London City airport.
The deal comes a year after BAA's Spanish owner Ferrovial put Gatwick up for sale, amid competition concerns 
about the operator's market dominance.
BAA is currently involved in an appeal against a ruling by the Competition Commission that it should sell three of its 
airports - Gatwick and Stansted and one of either Edinburgh or Glasgow. The company said today that proceeds 
from the sale of Gatwick will be used to repay part of its debt pile, which stood at £9.6 billion at the end of June. 
Ryanair called again for the Irish DAA monopoly to be broken up with Cork and Shannon being sold off and a 
competing low cost terminal built at Dublin Airport. The no-frills airline said it believes that competition is the only 
way to reverse the damage being done to Irish traffic and tourism by the high cost DAA monopoly. "In a year when 
Ryanair will grow by almost 9 million passengers, the DAA's high costs and its policy of ignoring its customers' 
wishes will result in 3 million passengers being lost at Dublin and 1 million passengers being lost between Cork and 
Shannon airports as well. Even Aer Lingus is growing traffic in the current recession, while the DAA monopoly is 
losing millions of passengers and thousands of jobs." Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: "We welcome today's sale of 
Gatwick Airport which is the first step in breaking up the BAA monopoly and delivering a better service and a better 
deal for customers. Irish tourism urgently needs to follow this UK model, by breaking up the high cost, inefficient 
DAA monopoly. "The fact that Gatwick Airport, one of the world's biggest international airports, with two terminals 
and over 32 million passengers annually is being sold for £1.5bn exposes the extraordinary waste which the DAA is 
engaged in at Dublin where they have squandered E1.2bn developing a second terminal which is neither needed 
Ryanair wants break up of "DAA monopoly" Ryanair On DAA
nor justified at a time when the existing terminal in Dublin (with the addition of Pier D) has a capacity of 30 million

Ryanair has today threatened to pull 75pc of its business out of Shannon unless the Government relents to its 
demand to scrap the E10 Travel Tax.
Ryanair has written to Shannon Airport confirming that it has lost money in each of the 5 years it has operated a 
base at Shannon Airport.
The no-frills airline said that it is willing to continue to base aircraft and deliver substantial passenger numbers and 
jobs at Shannon if the E10 tourist tax is removed on or before February 1 next year, just before its current contract 
with the airport runs out.
Ryanair is seeking a 50pc reduction in its costs at Shannon, which would reflect the 70pc decline in average fares 
which Ryanair has suffered at Shannon over the past 5 years, it said. It confirmed that it has entered into 
discussions with Shannon Airport about the terms for an extension of Ryanair's 5 year base agreement at Shannon 
which runs out in April 2010. Under the current 5 year agreement which was signed in late 2004, Ryanair has 
invested over USD400m in Shannon Airport, and has grown its annual traffic at Shannon from 300,000 passengers 
in 2004, to 1.9m last year. Ryanair, which had based 6 aircraft in Shannon last winter, reduced this to 4 aircraft in 
summer 2009 and is reducing the base further to three aircraft in Winter 2009/1. Ryanair's Michael Cawley said: 
"We call again on the Irish Government to scrap this stupid and damaging E10 tourist tax. Since its introduction, 
traffic at the Irish airports has fallen by more than 15pc, at a time when Ryanair is growing by almost 1 million 
passengers each month. All of Ryanair's and Aer Lingus' traffic growth is now taking place outside of Ireland 
because of the impact of the DAA's high costs and the Government's tourist tax"

summer 2009 and is reducing the base further to three aircraft in Winter 2009/1. Ryanair's Michael Cawley said: 
"We call again on the Irish Government to scrap this stupid and damaging E10 tourist tax. Since its introduction, 
traffic at the Irish airports has fallen by more than 15pc, at a time when Ryanair is growing by almost 1 million 
passengers each month. All of Ryanair's and Aer Lingus' traffic growth is now taking place outside of Ireland 
because of the impact of the DAA's high costs and the Government's tourist tax"

News In Brief
## Willie Walsh, the former Aer Lingus chief executive, believes the future of the airline can only be secured if it 
merges with another airline. However, he added that a merger with Ryanair would be "very difficult" and would not 
benefit consumers. Speaking at the Jim Kemmy Business School at the University of Limerick yesterday, Mr Walsh 
said various factors had led to an uncertain future for Aer Lingus. "Given what has happened to the economy and 
given the way Aer Lingus has struggled in recent times, I think you could make an argument that its future as an 
independent carrier is not that secure and maybe Aer Lingus does need to look at a relationship with some other 
carrier or a number of other carriers," Mr Walsh said. - Irish Independent
## The main Irish subsidiary of internet giant Yahoo last year sustained a 19 per cent drop in pre-tax profits from 
76m euro to 61m euro after restructuring its business here. According to accounts posted to the Companies' Office, 
the company's turnover decreased by 44 per cent from 807m euro to 449m euro in the year to the end of 
December. Last night its parent, Yahoo Inc, owner of the second most popular US search engine, reported an 
increase in third-quarter profit after cutting costs by paring jobs and jettisoning businesses. Its Irish subsidiary, 
which supplies online advertising services for customers based in Europe and Asia-Pacific, paid a 150m euro 
dividend to its immediate Yahoo Dutch-based parent during last year. - Irish Times
## TG4 is the main beneficiary of the latest round of state funding for independently produced TV, with shows for 
the Irish language station scooping more grants than shows for the whole of RTE television. An announcement from 
the newly established Broadcasting Authority of Ireland yesterday showed that TG4 got more than 1.6m euro in 
grants in the latest Sound and Vision round, which made total awards of some 4.1m euro. Just over 1.5m euro was 
awarded for programmes destined for RTE stations, 425,000 euro for tv3 shows, and 210,000 euro for Setanta 
Ireland productions. - Irish Independent ## Nasdaq listed shipping group TBS International is to relocate to Ireland

International plc, which will be known as TBS Ireland. - Irish Times ## Irish Rail and its northern equivalent 
Translink have lost 60pc of their business on the Belfast-Dublin route due to the collapsed bridge at Malahide. The 
two companies expect to lose up to 2m euro as a result of the disruption, which has seen travellers transferred by

Airlines this afternoon started cashing in on the Irish soccer team's draw to play France in the World Cup play-off on 
November 18th with flight costs rising as high as E400 return for the match.
Ryanair is charging E316 to fly out on either the 17th and 18th and fly back the day after the game. Flying Aer 
Lingus is no better with the cost of travelling to the match on the same dates will set you back at least E390 and, 
possibly, E409.
Ireland's draw against France took place at 1.00 pm today. At 12.45pm, the cost of a November 17th flight to Paris 
on the Ryanair website was E24.99 before taxes and charges. At 1.15pm it became E124.99. Aer Lingus flights to 
Paris for the same date were priced at E30 just three days ago and this morning they similarly ballooned in price.
Fine Gael Sports Spokesman, John O'Mahony, called the fare hikes "a rip off" and said this is highlighted by the 
fact that Aer Lingus also hiked the price of flights to Lisbon, presumable as Ireland could also have been drawn 
against Portugal for the play-off. Three days ago, the cost of flights were E39 but, this morning, the same flight 
would have cost a traveller E90. "We all expect there to be some increase in airline prices for a game like this but 
cashing-in to this extent is ridiculous," he said.

Ryanair's Michael O'Leary has again threatened to stop buying altogether and start giving cash to the airline's 
shareholders.
He has made the threat as he continues negotiations for 200 aircraft to cover expansion plans after 2012.
"If for some reason we can't conclude an agreement with Boeing and Airbus, certainly by the end of the year, we 
will simply announce we are not going to buy any more aircraft," he has told reporters after a news conference on 
the airline's plans in Italy.
"We will then stop growing beyond 2012 when our current delivery stream runs out." Ryanair's fleet currently 
consists solely of Boeing aircraft but Mr O'Leary said earlier that, if French-headquartered Airbus offered a better 
deal, he would order Airbus planes. This has been a shock to Boeing's executives, but they have nevertheless 
adopted a tough bargaining stance with the Irish purchasing team. "If you can't get Boeing or Airbus to make a 
decision between now and December, I will just lose interest and go with plan B," he said. Ryanair's order is split in 
to two separate delivery contracts of 200 aircraft followed by 100 more later. O'Leary said that the airline could pay 
well over USD7bn for the 200-aircraft deal. Mr O'Leary said that he was quite happy to wait until Boeing's and 
Airbus's "order book collapses" due to falling passenger numbers to negotiate a better deal. The planes have a 
sticker price of about USD70 million each but Ryanair expects to negotiate at least a 50pc discount to pay about 
USD35m to USD40m each, he said. "The sticker price is USD70m, but we would never dream of paying anything 
like that." he said.

USD35m to USD40m each, he said. "The sticker price is USD70m, but we would never dream of paying anything 
like that." he said.

Ryanair's Michael O'Leary has again threatened to stop buying altogether and start giving cash to the airline's 
shareholders.
He has made the threat as he continues negotiations for 200 aircraft to cover expansion plans after 2012.
"If for some reason we can't conclude an agreement with Boeing and Airbus, certainly by the end of the year, we 
will simply announce we are not going to buy any more aircraft," he has told reporters after a news conference on 
the airline's plans in Italy.
"We will then stop growing beyond 2012 when our current delivery stream runs out." Ryanair's fleet currently 
consists solely of Boeing aircraft but Mr O'Leary said earlier that, if French-headquartered Airbus offered a better 
deal, he would order Airbus planes. This has been a shock to Boeing's executives, but they have nevertheless 
adopted a tough bargaining stance with the Irish purchasing team. "If you can't get Boeing or Airbus to make a 
decision between now and December, I will just lose interest and go with plan B," he said. Ryanair's order is split in 
to two separate delivery contracts of 200 aircraft followed by 100 more later. O'Leary said that the airline could pay 
well over USD7bn for the 200-aircraft deal. Mr O'Leary said that he was quite happy to wait until Boeing's and 
Airbus's "order book collapses" due to falling passenger numbers to negotiate a better deal. The planes have a 
sticker price of about USD70 million each but Ryanair expects to negotiate at least a 50pc discount to pay about 
USD35m to USD40m each, he said. "The sticker price is USD70m, but we would never dream of paying anything 
like that." he said.

When the leaders of the low-cost airline business flew into Barcelona last month for the World Low-Cost Airlines 
Congress , the industry's annual two-day meeting, the toast of the event was Allegiant Air.
A US airline based in Las Vegas, its fees for checked baggage ($15), boarding ($5), and seat assignment (up to 
$25) might make even Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary blush. If you would like even a drink of water on an 
Allegiant flight - an average journey is two-and-a-half hours - expect to pay.
A recent analysis of 92 airlines by IdeaWorks, an airline consultancy, shows that Ryanair's take from ancillary fees 
at 19.23 per cent of income is no longer the highest - 22.7 per cent of Allegiant's income now stems from ancillary 
sales. "Whether it's on-board or online, Allegiant rarely misses an opportunity to sell," says Jay Sorenson, president 
of IdeaWorks. "It's a well-defined business plan, consistently applied."
Such ancillary charges may enrage many passengers, but they have helped keep airlines aloft in the downturn. The 
average one-way fare on Allegiant is $87, but the airline collects almost $26 extra per passenger through in-flight 
sales.
Yet Allegiant says bookings are up by 59 per cent year-on-year and on average its flights are 85 per cent full - the 
result of a quirky, low-cost but highly profitable business model that flies from 60 mid-sized cities in the American 
hinterlands, like Fargo, North Dakota, and Wichita, Kansas, to resort destinations such as Las Vegas, Los Angeles, 
Phoenix, Fort Lauderdale and Tampa.
Allegiant co-founder and chief executive Maury Gallagher, an industry veteran who also co-founded ValuJet and 
WestAir, says: "If you live in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and we're getting you out for $150 where once you had to 
pay $800, you almost want to be nice to us to make sure we don't leave."
ValuJet was the first airline to introduce ticketless travel but was absorbed by a rival after one of its aircraft crashed 
in 1996, killing all 110 passengers and crew.
A low-cost airline staying aloft by always charging Allegiant Air is a no-frills carrier that never misses an 
opportunity to sell, says Ian Wylie
"That was a really tough time," recalls Andrew Levy, Allegiant's chief financial officer. "But it led to a raft of 
airworthiness directives."
Allegiant avoids big airports so that it is not in competition with larger airlines. For small, struggling regional airports, 
the touchdown of one of Allegiant's 43 middle-aged MD-80 aircraft is a lifeline. Boardings at Jamestown, North 
Dakota, for example, are up 48 per cent this year, says the state's airport authorities, mainly because Allegiant has 
come to town.
Allegiant agrees month-by-month leases and pays to use airport employees on a short-term contract basis, so it 
can exit quickly if the market fails to develop. For example, a service from Columbia, South Carolina to Tampa 
ended just two months after it had started.
The airline has identified another 300 routes and intends to fly to Mexico and the Caribbean. But according to Jim 
Parker, airline analyst at Raymond James, the company's reliance on small airports poses a long-term challenge for 
international expansion. "They can fly you non-stop from Fargo to Cancun no problem, but when you come back, 
there's no customs clearance in Fargo," he says. "They're going to have to stop first at a gateway airport, and that's 
a negative."
But increasingly, Mr Gallagher is describing Allegiant as a travel company that happens to own an airline. It already 
partners with other businesses such as Starwood, Alamo and Blue Man Group to bundle hotels, rental cars and 
show tickets into travel packages. About 30 per cent of the airline's customers buy these packages.
The eventual goal, he says, is to sell flights from other airlines on the Allegiant site. "Shortly, we should be 
identifiable to 100m people throughout the US," he says. "At that point, we can leverage the brand name and 
arrange all your travel."

DCC fills tank with oil majors' non-core assets

News analysis
The Dublin-based group is gaining from structural changes, says John Murray Brown
Body
Spot an oil truck on a country road in the UK with Shell or Texaco branding and the chances are it is owned by 
DCC.
The Dublin-based mini- conglomerate, with interests from healthfood to hazardous waste, has emerged as the UK's 
largest distributor of oil products, supplying the transport and farm sector and small commercial and industrial 
customers across the UK.
The development owes much to a structural shift in the shape of the UK oil market, as the majors sell non-core 
assets to concentrate on exploration and development.
Today Total, which trades as Total Butler, is the only big international oil company still involved in UK products 
distribution. DCC has been the main beneficiary of this shake-out, acquiring BP's Scottish operations in 2001, the 
Shell Direct UK business three years later, and last year the UK distribution business of Texaco, part of Chevron, 
the US company.
DCC is buying market share but also lining up long-term supply contracts, which is a vital factor in its energy 
division, says Caren Crowley, Davy stockbrokers' resources analyst.
The UK products market is still fragmented, made up of medium-sized private companies supplying regional 
markets.
DCC has made a number of smaller bolt-on acquisitions, including in 2006 Carlton Fuels, with depots in Liverpool, 
Sheffield and Immingham.
DCC fills tank with oil majors' non-core assets
The following year, DCC paid £50m for CPL Petroleum, part of Chesterfield-based CPL Industrial Holdings, 
formerly Coal Products Holdings.
This month it acquired Bayford Oil, a Leeds-based company founded in 1920, which as well as selling transport and 
heating fuels, supplies petrol and diesel to independent dealer-owned service stations under the Gulf brand.
In parallel, its energy division has been building a presence in the UK liquefied petroleum gas market, adding to its 
2002 purchase of British Gas's LPG business from Centrica.
With its Flogas and Altagas brands it is now the second-biggest supplier of LPG, a product with a wide range of 
industrial uses from hotel catering to running fork-lift trucks. Calor, part of SHV of the Netherlands, is market leader 
with about 50 per cent
Investor interest has centred on the opportunities in the energy division, which accounts for about half of profits, 
which in the year to March 2009 came to EUR174.8m (£159m) excluding exceptionals, up from EUR159.9m in 
2008.
"We have never bought an oil products business where we haven't been able to make a 20 per cent return on 
capital within 18 months of acquisition," says Tommy Breen, chief executive, in an interview with the Financial 
Times.
Operating profits in the energy division have grown more than fivefold from EUR19.3m to EUR100.9m for 2009.
Among the top 10 Irish companies, only Ryanair and Aryzta, the former IAWS food group, have enjoyed a better 
share price performance over the past five years.
Going back 10 years, DCC had no British presence. It did own an Ireland-based products business, having 
acquired Burmah's fuels business in Ireland and Cawoods and Fuel Services in Northern Ireland.
But the first break in the UK came when DCC was approached by BP, for whom it was already a customer as it 
owned the marine terminal in Belfast.
BP was looking for a buyer of its Falkirk-based oil marketing and distribution assets, which covered Scotland and 
the north of England.
"BP had about 60,000 customers. Part of the thinking was if they sold to us, they would have just one customer, 
which would reduce their credit exposure. They also wanted someone who would be a long-term partner. They are 
still interested in the ongoing sale of the product after all," says Mr Breen.
Today DCC is UK market leader with a 13 per cent share, and no other company has more than 3 per cent.
"It's a local business, regionally based. What we bring to the table is multiple brand management," says Mr Breen, 
who became chief executive in May last year, succeeding Jim Flavin, the driving force since DCC's foundation in 
1976 as a venture capital company called Development Capital Corporation.
In the year to March, DCC sold about 5.3bn litres of product, 35-40 per cent of which was diesel - the rest made up 
of kerosene heating oil and gas oil, the product used to fire burners in various industrial processes.
The company takes daily delivery from the big oil terminals around the UK and, from its 150-odd depots across the 
country, it services 600,000 customers.
Each depot might have between six and 10 trucks. "Each is like a little profit and loss account," says Mr Breen.
The UK's Office of Fair Trade treats the oil distribution market as a UK-wide market.
Although DCC would have a 20 per cent share in Scotland and about 14 per cent in the north of England, analysts 
believe it is probably free to buy any of its peers without hitting competition issues.
DCC fills tank with oil majors' non-core assets
But DCC's ambitions do not stop with the UK. In May, it bought Dansk Shell, the oil company's oil distribution 
business in Denmark for EUR14m.
DCC did not participate in the sale of Shell's German business. But there again, Shell broke up the assets in about 
a dozen lots - which Mr Breen wryly observes, could offer an opportunity for a company with a taste for 
consolidation.

Editing. The Oxford English Dictionary says this means either preparing written material for publication ''by 
correcting, condensing, or otherwise modifying it'', or preparing and arranging material for a recording or broadcast.
So by definition, it involves manipulating material so that an article or programme can be easily understood.
Without editors, newspapers would be too heavy to lift. On TV, every news item would go on for several hours. 
Episodes of multi-location reality shows such as The Apprentice would be three days long.
Someone needs to explain this to Ryanair's Michael O'Leary.
The airline boss appears to think it perfectly reasonable to insist that his contribution to a broadcast feature must 
run in full, untouched by an editor's hand. This was, he declared unapologetically last week, what he asked of 
BBC's Panorama programme because, he insisted, his input would otherwise be altered to suit Panorama's 
agenda.
His request was declined and the programme went ahead. On the day the show was to run, O'Leary published 25 
pages of e-mail correspondence with the BBC programme on the Ryanair website and issued a press release 
giving his side. He took issue with a claim made by a spokesman for BBC Panorama who had said: ''We wanted to 
interview Michael O'Leary, but he wanted editorial control and that is something that no broadcaster would agree 
to."
This was entirely false, Ryanair said.
''Ryanair sought no editorial control over this interview. All Ryanair asked for was that the interview, of whatever 
length (to be decided by the BBC) would not be edited, censored or cut by the Panorama editors."
But insisting that material remains uncut is a bid to exercise editorial control. It can't be done with print media and it 
can't be done on TV.
Media World
What if someone from the BBC refused to get on a Ryanair flight unless they could personally organise the seating 
plan?
Nonsense, right? This was a surprising gaffe from a company that usually follows a deft - if incendiary - line in 
public relations and marketing.
The e-mail correspondence shows that the BBC got a few things wrong in the course of its research (such as the 
issue of aircraft turnaround times), but surely Ryanair could have managed to defend itself on these issues? It's not 
like it has anything to fear from controversy.
But instead of cooperating with the BBC programme, or even ignoring it, which would have at least kept the whole 
episode relatively low profile, O'Leary made maximum fuss.
At the last minute, Ryanair tried to turn the dispute to its own advantage by directly urging customers to watch the 
BBC show and promising to give away 100,000 free flights for every false claim made.
Anyone who did so will have seen a reasonably balanced, hardly groundbreaking, programme that gave Ryanair 
management a pretty fair hearing - going as far as to run a wholly unedited impromptu interview with O'Leary on its 
website.
Final score: BBC: 2 (for showing off its integrity and for winning extra ratings). O'Leary's PR skills: nil.

Panorama BBC1
Rescue RTE1
Who Do You Think You Are? RTE1
O'Donoghue in the Dáil RTE One
You expect better of Panorama (BBC1).When it comes up with a turkey, as it did last week with Why Hate Ryanair, 
you would be forgiven for wondering if someone has removed the lead from the BBC's pencil and it has suddenly 
the need for the broadcasting equivalent of Viagra.
Was there anything new in this supposed expose¤? Well, Ryanair flight crew have to buy their own bottled water 
now, which seems like more petty meanness on Ryanair's part but par for the course. It won't affect the passengers 
unless there's mass dehydration on the flight deck.
Otherwise, these were the shocking revelations: The seats don't recline. Do they need to on short routes?
You have to pay for your coffee and sandwiches. Where don't you have to? Anyway, given the food on most 
economy flights, you'd be better off sucking your thumb until you get where you're going .
There are no little flap things in the seatbacks for safety cards and magazines. In this, Panorama had a point. As a 
not particularly happy flier, I'd find the safety instructions stuck to the back of the seat in front a constant reminder 
that if we'd been meant to fly, aircraft wouldn't need oxygen masks emergency exits and lifejackets with pathetic 
whistles.
O'Leary takes the Mick out of the BBC
Ryanair flies you to secondary airports miles from where you think you're going. Who, at this stage doesn't know 
this? So Dublin to Paris by Ryanair actually means Dublin to Beauvais, which is 90 kilometres from Paris. I don't 
like not landing at Charles de Gaulle, but tens of thousands don't seem to care.
Ryanair has all sorts of charges and penalties to which passengers are, and can become, liable. So far, all this 
squeezing hasn't led to the pips squeaking and taking their custom elsewhere.
Most of us most of the time fly in varieties of discomfort a step above steerage. Carrying baggage is a punishable 
offence. Cabin staff on short-haul, cheap flights have grown ruder and more detached. But then I've been flying 
since the 1960s,when every flight seemed to be an event staged to make the passenger, whose bank account had 
been plundered in advance, feel good about themselves. Would you like a drink, sir? Let me light your cigarette sir. 
. . and so on.
Michael O'Leary seems to feel good about himself all of the time. He must have felt particularly so when the 
Ryanair publicity machine made an unwitting, one might almost say witless, Panorama part of its sales team. 
Panorama interviewed a chap who said Ryanair had opened up the cities of Europe to him. It said the airline had a 
new fleet. That it tends to arrive on time (when reporter Vivian White took a flight it actually arrived 20 minutes 
early).
That it has an enviable safety record. Ryanair demanded in advance that any interview with O'Leary would be 
shown unedited, Panorama naturally declined. So no interview. White door-stepped O'Leary and the encounter 
backfired.
Did White think he was dealing with some fly-by-night Oirish roofer tricking old dears out of their life savings? 
Instead of evasion, White got the full treatment. O'Leary rendered him speechless in seconds, had him foosthering 
for words until there was little the unfortunate man could do but laugh at his own predicament.
To counter O'Leary's claims that even this would be edited to suit Panorama's 'agenda', the programme showed the 
encounter in full, adding to the quantity of egg on its face.
It's not for nothing that large numbers of Irish businesspeople name O'Leary as the man they most admire. They 
envy his chutzpah, the fact that he moves through the world to the sound of breaking balls, that his motto seems not 
to be 'The customer is always right', but 'The customer should always be grateful'.
In many ways, O'Leary seems to belong to another time, to an age of unalloyed capitalists with no compunctions. 
Yet men equipped with all the finesse MBAs should bestow look at this guy's style and lick their lips. They would if 
they could. And the BBC should have known better. Time and again, I've heard Ryanair spokesmen turn a 
potentially hostile interview into a massive plug for the company.
* On Thursday July 1,1999 the Air Corps established a 24-hour search and rescue Dauphin helicopter at Waterford 
airport. That afternoon, the crew posed for photographs and took an RTE team on a flight. By midnight, after trying 
to land in heavy fog after a rescue mission, the helicopter was a scattering of burning debris on the sand dunes of 
Tramore and the crew, Patrick Mooney, Niall Byrne, Mick Baker and David O'Flaherty, were dead.
Ironically, the episode of Rescue (RTE One) which told the story of the Dauphin disaster was shown on Monday, 
the night of the Pilatus PC9 crash in Galway which killed Air Corps pilot and cadet Derek Furniss and David Jevens.
I remember the night of the Waterford crash, because I was on Helvick Head and heard the Dauphin in the air.
I recall remarking about its presence in the fog, but didn't know what had happened until the following day. Alan 
Kelly of the Helvick lifeboat which rescued the boat whose distress calls had launched the helicopter and the 
lifeboat described the night as ''eerie'' with thick fog obscuring the familiar lights of the bay. ''The thing that hit me 
most was that I'd wished the lads a safe passage home, and they said the same thing back to me as well," Kelly 
said.
O'Leary takes the Mick out of the BBC
Rescue said the 24-hourWaterford operation had been launched with the Air Corps under pressure (presumably in 
part from the political arena) of losing the contract to a private company. But, as the air accident report pointed out, 
it was based in an airport with no air traffic control at night, there had been no safety audit of the new operation by 
the Air Corps and no local training, there was no weather database and there were 'abnormalities' in the airfield 
lighting system. And so four men died.
* I can't help wondering how they set about selecting people for Who Do You Think You Are? (RTE One). All of 
those featured have had interesting ancestors of one kind or another.
Ryan Tubridy, hewn out of holy republican bedrock, turned out to be a descendant of England's Plantagenet king, 
Edward III.
Who'd have thought it? Certainly not his grandfather, Todd Andrews, who on the morning of Bloody Sunday as a 
19-year-old ''psychologically unattuned to assassination'' set out to kill a British agent named Captain Nobel in 
Ranelagh. Nobel wasn't home.
Is there a scrapheap of sad celebs who have been approached by the makers and who turned out to have no gem 
of curiosity in their family history? Do they check up first to see who'll bore and who'll score?
Is there a grey television limbo full of the disappointed celebrity descendants of bogtrotters, turnip-snaggers, muck-
spreaders, day-labourers, slaveys, rural bores, city shysters, cattle drovers, starving peasants, shebeen keepers, 
horse-fair tanglers, gombeen men and so on who have left no mark on any escutcheon?
Family history seems to be something that, like the Ancient Mariner, grips people especially at a certain age, 
around retirement say. I don't suppose I'll ever go chasing ancestors down the generations, bothering them. None 
of them having left position or title or money enough to live the life I'd really like, their influence is purely genetic: no 
large houses, no land, no snug little companies unaffected by the recession, just a disposition to hair loss and 
weight gain.
But how do celebs seem always to have the odd bit of royalty or a notable captain of industry or, like actress 
Fionnula Flanagan last week, a republican leftie, a member of the original Saor Eire, who fought against Franco, in 
their background?
Or a nice bit of real poverty, a workhouse or an industrial school? Flanagan had both, so seemed to have an 
embarrassment of poverty's riches.
But not quite. Her mother, Rosanna, was born in the Loughlinstown workhouse, now St Columcille's Hospital, not 
because she was poor but because her parents were employed there. Patrick McGurk had applied for the job of 
lunatic keeper, failed, and got a better-paid position as a storekeeper and superintendent. He married the 
workhouse seamstress.
In an interesting insight into the attitudes of the time - perhaps, they wouldn't be so different now - 54 parents in 
Loughlinstown national school wrote to object to ''pauper "' children from the workhouse being sent to the school for 
fear of the ''moral contamination'' these ''unsuitable companions'' might bring to their ''decent children''.
On the other side of her family, her grandmother, Polly, aged 12 and her aunt Annie, aged 10 really did have it 
rough. They were sentenced by the Dublin Police Court for begging and sent to Goldenbridge industrial school for 
four and six years respectively. All this was sad stuff, and Flanagan brought her acting skills to bear on it with sighs 
and, as they say, pregnant pauses.
She and her brother, Rory, followed their father's career in Spain during the Civil War.
Terry Flanagan had been one of those interviewed in Cathal O'Shannon's excellent documentary, Even the Olives 
are Bleeding, made over 30 years ago.
O'Leary takes the Mick out of the BBC
The title is based on a phrase uttered by poet Charlie Donnelly shortly before he was killed at the brutal battle of 
Jarama, outside Madrid, where Terry Flanagan was wounded by a hand grenade.
His daughter now lives in Hollywood and has made a good living for herself in theatre, films and television, an 
industry where a man with her father's beliefs would probably have been driven out of work by that great Irish 
American, the so-different Senator Joe McCarthy.
* Watching John O'Donoghue's performance in the Dáil (RTE One) reminded me of an image and a phrase both of 
which I came across as a child in an encyclopaedia.
The image was a 19th century caricature of Daniel O'Connell as a naughty boy in a corner.
Two Kerrymen with their backs to the wall, one sulking, the other brimming with injured pride. Oddly, the character 
in the print bears a resemblance to the politician of the present.
The phrase was Robert Clive's. He'd fought for and grabbed much of India (and, incidentally, got his hands on a 
couple of bits of Clare and Limerick) for British trade in the 18th century. An ungrateful parliament called him to 
account for the vast wealth this enterprise had generated, to which Clive famously retorted: ''By God Mr Chairman, I 
stand astonished at my own moderation."
O'Donoghue's self-serving speech was given in the old-style, orotund, over-precise, legalistic language of which he 
has always been fond. It passes for oratory in the Dáil and for Ciceronian oratory among the Fianna Fáil faithful. 
And despite his claims of being denied his right to vindicate himself in what he saw as the proper (private) quarter, it 
served its purpose. O'Donoghue read into the record of the Dáil his version of events. Perhaps he should be 
grateful to Eamon Gilmore for that.
While the man may appear pompous, bombastic and a prey to hubris, those in the glasshouse that is Irish politics 
were slow to throw stones. O'Donoghue wasn't alone; we once had a taoiseach, a modest and unassuming man of 
the people, who spent EUR 30,000 a year on makeup.
O'Donoghue's assertion that he never benefited financially from being frog marched by protocol into limousines and 
elegant hotels is true, but disingenuous. That sort of treatment is a benefit-in-kind that makes a man feel mighty 
good about himself, like the old-style corporate cliché of having the key to the executive washroom.
Nobody wants Irish ministers staying in flophouses or (Greens might take a different view) riding around in the local 
equivalent of rickshaws. But let them be honest about the ego-boosting, pleasurable side of their jobs:
the drivers, the cars, the government jets, the club lounges, the kow-tows, those lovely jubbly eye-watering 
expenses.
Some of them now are giving the impression that being ushered into a VIP lounge is the equivalent of dying for 
Ireland.

The BBC aired a Panorama documentary about Ryanair last week. In common with much modern-day factual 
programming, it was a headacheinducing miasma of crash zooms, jerky editing and contrived situations, containing 
little in the way of an actual story.
The central thesis was that Ryanair fleeces money from its customers any way it can, while still delivering rock-
bottom airfares.
Another dimension of the 'exposé' was that Ryanair revels in its cheap and ruthless image. Gosh, really?
A plummy, bespectacled BBC reporter even took a hidden camera onto a Ryanair flight, to reveal that a sandwich 
and a coffee will, er, set you back seven quid. Overpriced airline food? Surely not. Needless to say, when the 
hapless hack finally caught up with our Michael, the latter made utter mincemeat out of him, not answering a single 
question and turning the doorstepstyle interview into another cheeky advert for his budget airline.
For me, the only moments of revelation came when, to create a semblance of balance, the programme ran 
snapshot interviews with Ryanair frequent flyers. For that was when I realised; we are wrong to hate Michael 
O'Leary.
We are wrong, even, to despise Richard Branson, although I would qualify that by saying if I had to be locked in a 
room with either gentleman, I'd pick O'Leary every time.
The green movement detests people like Branson and O'Leary, because they are clearly profiting from pollution. 
Although O'Leary, at least, has the honesty to stick two fingers up to the green movement, whereas Branson goes 
to enormous PR lengths to convince customers that transatlantic flights, space tourism and Formula 1 are 
somehow eco friendly activities.
However, as I watched these Ryanair frequent flyers drone on about all the cities they had visited, it struck me that 
O'Leary and Branson are not the bogeymen - we are.
Eco Warrior
Anonymous, spoiled, all-consuming us. Airlines merely pander to our self-indulgent whims. If the general public 
gave a monkey's toss about pollution, we wouldn't be flying to Prague for stag parties, to Malaga three times a year, 
or to Croatia for the weekend. The very idea that some dark plot exists, designed to keep us eating, drinking, 
driving, flying or generally consuming too much is just nonsense. We do all these things to excess, because we 
want to, and because we can.
There's a bit of a debate going on among the eco-conscious at the moment, sparked by George Monbiot, the 
Guardian newspaper's high priest of matters green. Last month, he wrote a column arguing that overconsumption, 
not overpopulation, was to blame for global warming. It was well argued stuff, although it did not suggest at what 
point humanity as a whole should curtail its numbers.
Nonetheless, our inbuilt predisposition towards wasteful consumption is what persuades me (reluctantly) that the 
Green Party was right to continue in its coalition with Fianna Fáil.
The party of waste, being propped up by the party that hates waste. Ironic, perhaps, but it is only at government 
level, with universallyimplemented policies, that inherent wastefulness can be tackled.
Most of us will not tackle it for ourselves - quite the opposite.
Given the opportunity, we will indulge it, and frivolous flying is just one example.
If Michael O'Leary or the hippy Branson weren't merrily flogging us cheap airline tickets, then someone else would 
be.
Without a hand in policy-making, pro environment parties may as well be pissing in the wind. Of course, this does 
not solve the lunacy that is Nama, but I suspect that, secretly, many Greens see no problem with Ireland having to 
wear a hairshirt for quite sometime to come. It might even curb some of our more shameful excesses.

OFT casts a wide net for online privacy inquiry
OFT casts a wide net for online privacy inquiry

Internet retailers and online search companies will be among those investigated in the next six months by the Office 
of Fair Trading as it conducts an inquiry into the targeting of UK internet users through advertising and pricing.
The inquiry, to be completed by spring 2010, will see the OFT examine web services offered by an array of 
companies from leading grocery groups to smaller and more specialist sites.
Privacy lobbyists said the decision was a sign the UK could be about to get much tougher on abuses of private 
information on the internet.
The OFT said this week it would launch an investigation into behavioural targeting, where advertisers build a profile 
of internet users based on their browsing history and use that to send them relevant ads.
It is also looking at the practice of customised pricing, where internet retailers may vary their pricing depending on 
an individual's profile and estimates of their willingness to pay.
"Behavioural advertising is rising fast, but a lot of companies don't disclose what forms tracking are taking place," 
said Struan Robertson, technology lawyer at Pinsent Masons. "To most people it is not clear when it is happening. 
There is scope to improve disclosure on this."
The move will put companies such as Google, Microsoft and Yahoo, all of which track internet users' browsing and 
search preferences, under increased scrutiny.
Behavioural targeting came into focus in the UK last year when Phorm, an online advertising technology group, 
unveiled plans to monitor the internet habits of BT, TalkTalk and Virgin Media's customers. The plans were 
approved by the Information Commissioner but consumer backlash eventually forced the company to put them on 
hold .
The UK has often been seen as softer on privacy protection than many of its European neighbours. It was 
noticeably absent last week from a report by the European Commission on the fines handed out by national data 
OFT casts a wide net for online privacy inquiry
protection regulators for data loss and spam. While the Netherlands, for example, has handed out fines to websites 
using illegal monitoring technology, the UK tends to 'name and shame'.
Targeted advertising has come under increasing scrutiny by regulators globally with the US Federal Trade 
Commission, Canada's privacy commissioner and the EC all looking at how to strengthen action against online 
privacy threats.
A survey of US consumers this week showed that about two-thirds do not want marketers to tailor advertisements 
to their interests, even if the information about them is kept anonymous.
The OFT is also planning a separate market study of the way companies display prices on the internet, including 
potentially misleading practices such as "drip" pricing, where the initial cost appears low, but incremental charges 
such as postage and handling fees mount up.
The OFT took Ryanair, the low-cost airline, to task last year over unclear pricing information on its website, and 
Consumer Focus, the lobby group, has raised concerns that some price comparison sites may be failing to provide 
accurate and unbiased information.

A string of poor results from US corporate giants, GE and Bank of America, sent Irish and European shares sliding 
lower.
The ISEQ fell by 52.05 points to 3,266.51.
General Electric reported a 42 percent drop in profit, as a global economic slump hammered its hefty finance arm 
and eroded demand for the heavy equipment it manufactures. The largest U.S. conglomerate, whose shares were 
down 0.8 percent in pre-market trading on Wall Street, reported third-quarter profit of dollar 2.49 billion, or 23 cents 
per share, compared with earnings of USD4.31 billion, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 20 percent 
to USD37.8 billion. Bank of America, meanwhile, posted a USD1 billion loss for the period.
In Dublin, banks once again led the decline with AIB falling 10c to E2.67 and Bank of Ireland down 6c to E2.69. 
Investors continue to be underwhelmed by the NAMA newsflow. With over 200 amendments expected to be tabled 
by the Government and Opposition parties, investors are cautious of buying bank shares until a clearer picture of 
exactly what the NAMA legislation will look like emerges. Irish Life and Permanent rose by 8c to E5.63. Valmont 
Industries, which manufactures engineered support structures for infrastructure in the US, reported third quarter 
profits ahead of last year due to strong growth in the utility sector and the impact of operating leverage. The utility 
support structures division, which provides steel and concrete structures to the US utility market, was the strongest 
area with sales up on the same quarter last year. CRH also serves this market through its pre-cast concrete division 
within Americas Products. The Irish giant's shares fell 78c to E19.50 as investors took profits from a solid 
performance on Thursday for the stock. Ryanair shares have been trading in no-man's land for the past month, 
broadly in a E3.40 to E3.60 range. Goodbody Stockbrokers said that the last Investor Day at the airline gave little 
update on the trading front, though did create the uncertainty about whether Ryanair would agree to a deal with 
Boeing for new aircraft, with implications for its yield and growth plans. So the next important reference point is the

November first half and second quarter results. "We are sitting on yield declines of 17pc for the year and 20pc in Q2 
after the 13pc decline in Q1. Since Q2 is the big quarter, the market is looking for the figure not to be over 20pc and 
also for the declines to start easing, which is unlikely prior to the Q4 figures (i.e. we anticipate a further 20pc decline 
in Q3). However, in the last few days, crude oil has jumped to two month highs. While European airlines have 
retraced back to late September highs, the US sector is rolling over and the results from Southwest yesterday saw 
that stock down near 6pc as the company highlighted rising fuel prices as a concern." Ryanair shares were down 1c 
to E3.39. Computacenter, a peer of DCC in the IT distribution markets in the UK and France, issued its interim 
management statement for the full year to September, which stated that overall trading had been inline with 
expectations. DCC's shares fell 16c to E18.42.

3 airlines ask Ireland to ax its passenger tax

Body
In an unusual act of unity, three competing airlines called Wednesday for Ireland to abandon its &#8264;5) tax on 
all departing air passengers because it's hurting traffic volume at a time of deep recession.
The joint statement from the chief executives of Ryanair, Aer Lingus and Cityjet said average passenger numbers 
leaving Dublin Airport have fallen 15 percent since the introduction of the &#8264;-head tax in April.
They forecast that business at Ireland's main airport would fall this year by 3 million passengers to 21 million, and 
blamed the tax for inflicting "a devastating impact on traffic and visitor numbers."
The government of Prime Minister Brian Cowen offered no immediate reaction.
Ireland is facing its worst fiscal and economic crisis since the 1930s. The government is drafting an emergency 
December budget designed to cut &#8264;ion ($6 billion) off its soaring deficit through a range of tax increases and 
spending cuts. It previously has defended its imposition of an air-ticket tax as a necessary part of raising more 
money from all sectors of the economy.
The airlines counter that taxing air travel just makes matters worse, because it discourages tourists from picking 
Ireland as a destination and spending money here on hotels, meals and goods. Ireland has a 21.5 percent rate of 
sales tax.
Ireland is one of just three European countries that adds a tax to departing air tickets, along with the United 
Kingdom and France. Belgium last year backed off its own plans to add such a fee, and the Dutch dropped theirs 
earlier this year, after facing industry opposition.
Normally, Aer Lingus and Ryanair are locked in a war of words and rarely speak with one voice on anything. 
Ryanair already owns 30 percent of Aer Lingus and remains committed to eventually absorbing the struggling, 
formerly state-owned airline.
Cityjet is a Dublin-based subsidiary of Air France. Its flights link Dublin with London and Paris.

Four professionals offer expert advice
Body
Last week, Daniel Vasella, chief executive of Novartis, the Swiss pharmaceuticals company, hit back at animal 
rights activists who have attacked both him and his company, including the desecration of a family grave. This 
fightback has been an unusually aggressive public response by a CEO. Many prefer to keep their heads down and 
wait for protests to fade. How should business leaders engage with hostile critics: confront them, bring them inside 
for a talk or ignore them?
THE ADVICE
THE MANAGEMENT THINKER 
John Elkington
Daniel Vasella was right to protest at this outrage. He has done more than most CEOs on societal issues, and this 
was a personal insult of a particularly unpleasant kind, at which we should all protest. Few issues are as charged as 
animal welfare, but that doesn't mean the agenda is unmanageable. I have been involved in projects that engaged 
parts of the animal welfare movement, with considerable progress. Multi-stakeholder forums can boil down complex 
agendas to a few priorities for a company. We also have involved activists who have more extreme views, though 
this requires sensitive handling, coupled with a willingness to make real changes - and a clear sense of where to 
draw the line. At the same time, some companies have made progress in reducing the numbers of animals 
"sacrificed". We may yet see a shift in attitudes on the treatment of animals, from toxicology labs to the US's 
sprawling feed-lots, but in the meantime companies such as Novartis know that this is one of those areas where 
they are almost always going to be on the back foot.

People' 
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE
When should a chief executive confront hostile critics publicly?
 Don Elgie
This is a no-brainer - hostile critics don't go away just because you won't talk to them. In fact, it usually inflames the 
situation. CEOs need to engage critics - it's even possible there is a justifiable gripe that the CEO needs to be made 
aware of. I can't promise I'll win a critic round but I'll never stop trying and I'll become better informed in the process. 
"United Broke My Guitar" was set up by a passenger who failed for a year to get compensation when his guitar was 
broken on a United Airlines flight. He wrote a ditty that has had nearly 6m YouTube hits. I bet United wished it 
handled the complaint differently. The internet has empowered customers so, fellow CEOs, you ignore this 
phenomenon at your peril. (How long will it be before Ryanair is on the back foot with its attitude to customer 
complaints?)
The writer is CEO of Creston, the media group
THE ACTIVIST 
Barbara Stocking
Many businesses are no longer acting on the defensive or denying criticism. Instead they have built responsible 
behaviour into the heart of their work and will be reaching out to critics to hold meaningful dialogue and promote 
mutual understanding. For both businesses and campaigning organisations, the more constructive approach is to 
resolve issues together before they become a public argument. Oxfam's principle is that if we want a business to 
consider our standpoint, our first approach will always be dialogue. This doesn't mean campaigning won't happen, 
but we will maintain conversations with a company, even if we are running a proactive campaign against them. 
Ultimately, we want to influence them to change bad practice into good and if we cannot persuade them through 
dialogue we will move to a public approach. If a discussion with a consumer-focused business doesn't influence 
them to change policy, we will let their customers know through media and social networking sites; this is often a 
situation that most businesses would prefer to avoid. Where we see injustice, we will campaign, but we also 
understand that meaningful dialogue is ultimately more likely to lead to positive outcomes.
The writer is chief executive of Oxfam UK
THE PR
Robert Phillips
Ignoring them is not an option. Engaged conversation is the preferred route, as long as both sides are prepared to 
listen, and the antagonists stay within the law. There have to be limits to the hostility. This approach runs to the 
heart of what we call public engagement - what will public relations look like beyond the digital revolution? This 
requires constructive dialogue and the emergence of new and responsible partnerships that advance shared 
interests among multiple stakeholders: business, governments, NGOs and, of course, citizens (even activist ones). 
In this new, democratised and bottom-up world, it is OK to disagree and it's equally OK to promote a singular 
viewpoint, so long as transparency and honesty is the default position. We call this "open advocacy". Our London 
office was recently targeted by a bunch of naked protestors from Climate Camp, angry at our work for Eon, the 
energy group. Our immediate response was to engage them in dialogue (once they had put their clothes back on) 
and to have an open conversation. A few remain in conversation with us today.
