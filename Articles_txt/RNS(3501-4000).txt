regard to the comparative marketplace in Ireland and the United Kingdom, in order to ensure that they are 
properly motivated to perform in the best interests of the shareholders. Details of total remuneration

periods but may be terminated with 12 months notice by either party.  Mr. O'Leary is subject to a covenant

 Dividend policy
 Details of the Company's dividend policy are disclosed on page 121 of the Annual Report.
 Share buy-back
 On June 20, 2013 the Company detailed plans to return up to EUR1.0 billion to shareholders over the

shareholder approval at the AGM on September 25, 2014).
 In the year ended March 31, 2014 the Company bought back 69.5 million ordinary shares (including just 
over 6.0 million American Depositary Receipts (ADR's), which each represented five ordinary shares) at a 
total cost of EUR481.7 million.  This is equivalent to approximately 4.8% of the Company's issued share 
capital at March 31, 2013.  All ordinary shares repurchased were cancelled. Accordingly, share capital 
decreased by 69.5 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of EUR0.4 million and the capital 
redemption reserve increased by a corresponding EUR0.4 million.  The capital redemption reserve is 
required to be created under Irish law to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
 Accountability and audit

30 to 31. They have also considered the going concern position of the Company and their conclusion is set 
out on page 28. The Board has established an Audit Committee whose principal tasks are to consider 
financial reporting and internal control issues. The Audit Committee, which consists exclusively of 
independent non-executive directors, meets at least quarterly to review the financial statements of the 
Company, to consider internal control procedures and to liaise with internal and external auditors. In the 
year ended March 31, 2014 the Audit Committee met on five occasions. On a quarterly basis the Audit 
Committee receives an extensive report from the internal auditor detailing the reviews performed in the 
year, and a risk assessment of the Company. This report is used by the Audit Committee and the Board of 
Directors, as a basis for determining the effectiveness of internal control.  The Audit Committee 
regularly considers the performance of internal audit and how best financial reporting and internal 
control principles should be applied.
 In addition, the Audit Committee has responsibility for appointing, setting compensation and overseeing 
the work of the independent auditor. The Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and permissible non-audit 
services provided by the independent auditor.

                 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES Q1 PROFIT INCREASE OF 21%
                    NET MARGIN OF 18%, AS TRAFFIC GROWS 28%
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Tuesday, 3rd August 2004)
announced record profits for Q1 ended 30 June 2004 of EUR53.1m. Passenger volumes
grew by a record 28% to 6.6m passengers whilst yields declined by 6% during the
quarter and, as a result, total revenues rose by 23% to EUR302.8m. Unit costs fell
by 4% and in turn the net margin after tax remains stable at an industry leading
18%.

Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
Note 1: Adjusted profit after tax and EPS excludes the non-recurring costs of
the re-organisation of "Buzz" in April 2003 of EUR2.7m (net of tax) and goodwill
charges arising of EUR0.6m in both the quarters ended 30 June 2003 and 2004.
Announcing these results, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
        "These record quarterly results reflect the continued disciplined roll
         out of Ryanair's low fares model. Passenger volumes grew by 28% to 6.6m
         in the quarter and we carried more passengers in 3 months than the total
         traffic carried by Aer Lingus in a full year. Our two new bases at Rome
         Ciampino and Barcelona Girona have performed particularly well.
         Ryanair's strong performance is also reflected in the recent increases
         in monthly traffic and load factors.
        "Yields were 6% lower than last year, a decline that was towards the
         lower end of our -5% to -10% guidance. Our forward yield guidance
         remains unchanged. In Quarter 2 we anticipate a yield decline of between
         -5% to -10%. Next winter, we expect the yield decline to be in the -10%
         to - 20% range as chronically loss making competitors will continue to
         dump prices, resulting in even more airline casualties this winter.
        "The higher oil prices have continued through the summer and unlike many
         high fare flag competitors, we have not imposed fuel surcharges. We
         remain almost fully hedged until the end of Quarter 2 but largely
         unhedged thereafter. We believe that over the medium term prices will
         fall and therefore it would be unwise to lock-in at the current high
         rates. We anticipate that we will be able to largely offset these higher
         oil prices in this fiscal year by making cost savings in other areas.
        "We have announced a major expansion of our London Luton base from 1 to
         4 aircraft. In addition to our successful Dublin and Milan routes, we
         will now fly from Luton to Barcelona Girona, Barcelona Reus, and Murcia
         in Spain, Dinard and Nimes in France, Esjberg in Denmark, Rome Ciampino
         and Venice in Italy, and Stockholm in Sweden. We have also announced two
         new routes from London Stansted to Santander and Zaragossa in Spain and
         continue to grow our base at Rome Ciampino launching new routes to
         Santander in Spain, Paris-Beauvais and Eindhoven in Holland. We also
         have launched our expansion into the new EU member countries and will
         start 3 routes from Riga - the capital city of Latvia - to London,
         Tampere and Frankfurt on 30 October next. Many more airports continue to
         encourage Ryanair to launch new routes and as usual we have far more
         offers than we can presently handle and this will drive down airport
         costs.
        "Unit costs fell by 4% during the quarter (excluding fuel and route
         charges unit costs fell by 5.4%). We continue to benefit from the
         ongoing introduction of the larger 737-800's as they replace the
         remaining thirteen 737-200's. The remaining 737-200's will be retired by
         December 2005. We continue to focus on lowering our cost base and pass
         on these lower costs in the form of even lower fares to our passengers.
         "The legislation recently introduced by the Irish government to break up
         Aer Rianta will enable (for the first time ever) all of the government
         owned Irish airports to compete on a level playing field. We welcome
         this much delayed legislation and encourage the Minister to quickly
         introduce competition at Dublin airport by directing the construction of
         a second and third competing terminals. This initiative will finally
         introduce competition, will result in lower prices, deliver better
         facilities, and bring millions more visitors to Ireland.
        "We have recently filed proceedings in the High Court in London for the
         recovery of overcharging on fuel levies by BAA plc, the monopoly
         operator of London's three major airports. The BAA has been charging a
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
         fuel levy since 1991, which was agreed at the time to recover the GBP12.5m
         cost of the fuel hydrant system. Since that date, thanks to Ryanair's
         enormous growth, BAA has recovered over GBP39m in fuel levies or more than
         three times the original cost and yet this extortionate levy remains
         unchanged. BAA have also issued Court proceedings arising out of the
         fuel levy dispute and we look forward to the Court's ruling on the BAA
         overcharging. Ryanair continues to oppose anti-consumer charges at these
         monopoly airports. It is untenable for the BAA airport monopoly to
         impose fuel levies in excess of 300% of cost on its low fare consumers,
         whilst at the same time providing free of charge car parking to
         politicians. This anti-consumer rip-off must end.
        "We continue to be cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the
         year. We expect to achieve passenger volume growth this fiscal year in
         the order of 20% and deliver increased load factors. We believe that
         yield attrition this winter will be within our forecast range of -10% to
         -20%. The reality is that the high cost, high fare airlines, and those
         so called low fare loss makers are unable to compete with Ryanair's low
         fares, low cost base and industry leading customer service. As Southwest
         has repeatedly demonstrated in the US for many years, the lowest cost
         carrier always wins."

 The Company's net cash provided by financing activities totaled EUR238.1 million in the 2011 fiscal year, largely 
reflecting the receipt of proceeds from long-term borrowings of EUR991.4 million in fiscal year 2011, offset in part 
by repayments of long-term borrowings of EUR280.7 million.
 Capital Expenditures. The Company's net cash outflows for capital expenditures in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 
were EUR310.7 million and EUR290.4 million, respectively. Ryanair has funded a significant portion of its 
acquisition of new Boeing 737-800 aircraft and related equipment through borrowings under facilities provided by 
international financial institutions on the basis of guarantees issued by the Export-Import Bank of the United States 
("Ex-Im Bank"). At March 31, 2013, Ryanair had a fleet of 305 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, the majority of which (210 
aircraft) were funded by Ex-Im Bank-guaranteed financing. Other sources of on-balance-sheet aircraft financing 
utilized by Ryanair are Japanese Operating Leases with Call Options ("JOLCOs"), which are treated as finance 
leases (30 of the aircraft in the fleet as of March 31, 2013) and commercial debt financing (6 of the aircraft in the 
fleet as of March 31, 2013). Of Ryanair's total fleet of 305 Boeing 737-800 aircraft at March 31, 2013 there were 59 
aircraft which were financed through operating lease arrangements. Of the 15 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft which 
Ryanair took delivery of between April 1, 2012 and March 31, 2013, four were financed through sale-and-leaseback 
financings and the remainder through Ex-Im Bank guaranteed-financing. Ryanair has generally been able to 
generate sufficient funds from operations to meet its non-aircraft acquisition-related working capital requirements. 
Management believes that the working capital available to the Company is sufficient for its present requirements 
and will be sufficient to meet its anticipated requirements for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for 
the 2014 fiscal year.
 The Company's net cash outflows for capital expenditures in fiscal years 2012 and 2011 were EUR290.4 million 
and EUR897.2 million, respectively. Of the 25 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft which Ryanair took delivery of between 
April 1, 2011 and March 31, 2012, 11 were financed through sale-and-leaseback financings and the remainder 
through Ex-Im Bank guaranteed-financing.
 The following table sets forth the dates on which and the number of aircraft that will be delivered to the Company 
pursuant to the 2013 Boeing Contract:

Capital Resources. Ryanair's long-term debt (including current maturities) totaled EUR3,498.3 million at March 31, 
2013 and EUR3,625.2 million at March 31, 2012, with the change being primarily attributable to financing of new 
aircraft and repayment of existing debt facilities. Please see the table "Obligations Due by Period" below for more 
information on Ryanair's long-term debt (including current maturities) and finance leases as of March 31, 2013. See 
also Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 for further information on the maturity 
profile of the interest rate structure and other information on, the Company's borrowings.
 The Company's purchase of the 15 Boeing 737-800 aircraft delivered in the 2013 fiscal year has been funded by a 
combination of financing solutions, including bank loans supported by Ex-Im Bank guarantees (eleven aircraft) and 
sale-and-leaseback financings (four aircraft). At March 31, 2013, the majority of the aircraft in Ryanair's fleet had 
been financed through loan facilities with various financial institutions active in the structured export finance sector 
and supported by a loan guarantee from Ex-Im Bank. Each of these facilities takes essentially the same form and is 
based on the documentation developed by Ryanair and Ex-Im Bank, which follows standard market forms for this 
type of financing. In November 2010, Ryanair financed seven aircraft through a U.S. dollar-denominated Ex-Im 
Bank Capital Markets Product ("Eximbond"). The Eximbond has essentially the same characteristics as all previous 
Ex-Im Bank guaranteed financings with no additional obligations on Ryanair. On the basis of an Ex-Im Bank 
guarantee with regard to the financing of up to 85% of the eligible U.S. and foreign content represented in the net 
purchase price of the relevant aircraft, the financial institution investor enters into a commitment letter with the 
Company to provide financing for a specified number of aircraft benefiting from such guarantee; loans are then 
drawn down as the aircraft are delivered and payments to Boeing become due. Each of the loans under the 
facilities are on substantially similar terms, having a maturity of 12 years from the drawdown date and being 
secured by a first priority mortgage in favor of a security trustee on behalf of Ex-Im Bank.
 Through the use of interest rate swaps or cross currency interest rate swaps, Ryanair has effectively converted a 
portion of its floating-rate debt under its financing facilities into fixed-rate debt. Approximately 34% of the loans for 
the aircraft acquired under the above facilities are not covered by such swaps and have therefore remained at 
floating rates linked to EURIBOR, with the interest rate exposure from these loans largely hedged by placing a 
similar amount of cash on deposit at floating interest rates. The net result is that Ryanair has effectively swapped or 
drawn down fixed-rate euro-denominated debt with maturities between seven and twelve years in respect of 
approximately 66% of its outstanding debt financing at March 31, 2013 and of this total approximately 49% of this 
debt has been partially swapped, with the relevant swaps covering the first seven years of the twelve-year 
amortizing period.
 The table below illustrates the effect of swap transactions (each of which is with an established international 
financial counterparty) on the profile of Ryanair's total outstanding debt at March 31, 2013. See "Item 11. 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Interest Rate Exposure and Hedging" for additional 
details on the Company's hedging transactions.
At March 31, 2013                                                                   EUR          EUR

 ==========  ============
The weighted-average interest rate on the cumulative borrowings under these facilities of EUR3,498.3 million at 
March 31, 2013 was 2.5%. Ryanair's ability to obtain additional loans pursuant to each of the facilities to finance the 
price of future Boeing 737-800 aircraft purchases is subject to the issuance of further bank commitments and the 
satisfaction of various contractual conditions. These conditions include, among other things, the execution of 
satisfactory documentation, the requirement that Ryanair perform all of its obligations under the Boeing agreements 
and provide satisfactory security interests in the aircraft (and related assets) in favor of the lenders and Ex-Im Bank, 
and that Ryanair not suffer a material adverse change in its conditions or prospects (financial or otherwise).
 As part of its Ex-Im Bank guarantee-based financing of the Boeing 737-800s, Ryanair has entered into certain 
lease agreements and related arrangements. Pursuant to these arrangements, legal title to the 210 aircraft 
delivered and remaining in the fleet as of March 31, 2013 rests with a number of United States special purpose 
vehicles (the "SPVs") in which Ryanair has no equity or other interest. The SPVs are the borrowers of record under 
the loans made or to be made under the facilities, with all of their obligations under the loans being guaranteed by 
Ryanair Holdings.

                   Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley

                              Aer Lingus Group plc
        1. Introduction
The board of Ryanair announces that it has acquired through a wholly owned
subsidiary, Coinside Limited, 84,775,000 Aer Lingus Shares representing
approximately 16 per cent. of the Issued Share Capital of Aer Lingus. The board
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus -3-
of Ryanair now announces the terms of a Cash Offer for Aer Lingus to be made by
Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley on behalf of Ryanair, for the entire
issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Aer Lingus not already in the
beneficial ownership or control of Ryanair. The making of the Cash Offer is
subject to certain conditions set out in Appendix I, including, amongst other
conditions, the acceptance by Aer Lingus Shareholders holding not less than 90
per cent. of the issued and to be issued share capital of Aer Lingus (or such
lower percentage as Ryanair may determine subject always to the Takeover Rules)
not already in the beneficial ownership or control of Ryanair and the passing of
the Ryanair Shareholder Resolutions at an EGM to be held as soon as practicable
to approve the Offer.
        2. The Cash Offer
On behalf of Ryanair, Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley will offer to
acquire all of the issued and to be issued share capital of Aer Lingus not
already in the beneficial ownership or control of Ryanair, subject to the
conditions and on the terms set out in Appendix I to this announcement and to be
set out in the Offer Document and the related Forms of Acceptance, on the
following basis:
                    EUR2.80 in cash for every Aer Lingus Share
The board of Ryanair believes the Cash Offer represents an excellent price for
Aer Lingus Shares given that only 8 days ago the Government of Ireland, Aer
Lingus and their respective advisers determined that EUR2.20 was an appropriate
price at which to issue and sell Aer Lingus Shares pursuant to the IPO.
The Cash Offer values each Aer Lingus Share at EUR2.80 and values the Issued Share
Capital of Aer Lingus at approximately EUR1.481bn. It represents:
   a premium of approximately 27 per cent. over the IPO Price of an Aer
     Lingus Share of EUR2.20 per share; and
   a premium of approximately 12 per cent. over the Closing Price of an Aer
     Lingus Share on 4 October 2006, the last day prior to the date of this
     announcement, of EUR2.51.
In addition, the board of Ryanair notes that the Aer Lingus Share price
appreciation since the IPO occurred during the same short period in which
Ryanair acquired approximately 16 per cent. of Aer Lingus Shares at an average
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus -3-
price of EUR2.42 per Aer Lingus Share, which further emphasises the attractiveness
of the Cash Offer. On 2 October and 3 October, days during which Ryanair was not
actively buying Aer Lingus Shares, the price per Aer Lingus Share fell back from
EUR2.48 to EUR2.41.
The Offer will extend to all Aer Lingus Shares (other than those Aer Lingus
Shares already beneficially owned by Ryanair as at the date of the Offer)
unconditionally allotted or issued on the date of the Offer (including Aer
Lingus Shares issued pursuant to the Over Allotment Arrangements), together with
any further such shares which are unconditionally allotted or issued (including
Aer Lingus Shares issued pursuant to the Over Allotment Arrangements) while the
Offer remains open for acceptance or until such earlier date as, subject to the
Takeover Rules, Ryanair may determine.
The Aer Lingus Shares are to be acquired fully paid and free from all liens,
charges and encumbrances, rights of pre-emption and any other third party rights
or interests of any nature whatsoever and together with all rights
attaching thereto including the right to receive all dividends and other
distributions (if any) declared, made or paid thereafter.
The Offer shall be made by Ryanair or a wholly owned subsidiary of Ryanair.

        Aer Lingus lodges formal appeal with EU Court of First Instance
Dublin & London, 19 November 2007: Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus" or "the
Company") has confirmed that it will today lodge its formal appeal with the EU
Court of First Instance in Luxembourg as part of the legal process towards
removing Ryanair from its shareholder register.
If successful, the appeal will enable the EU Commission to order Ryanair to
 dispose of its stake in its main competitor.   This follows on from the EU
 Commission's recent decision that it does not have the legal authority to order
 a sell down of Ryanair's shares under Merger Regulation.  Aer Lingus is
 confident that the Regulation does give the Commission that power as the stake
 was part of the original takeover attempt which the Commission prohibited.
Aer Lingus has also asked the Court, as a matter of urgency, to make an order to
prevent Ryanair from interfering in the running of Aer Lingus' business pending
judgement on the appeal.
Aer Lingus Group PLC Appeal to EU Court
Commenting, John Sharman, Aer Lingus Chairman, said: "Aer Lingus is forging
ahead with its plans for growth and refuses to be undermined by its competitor.
It is our intention to deal with the presence of Ryanair on our shareholder
register decisively through short-term interim measures, as well as seeking a
speedy permanent resolution from the Court of First Instance."

Body
 The weighted-average interest rate on the cumulative borrowings under these facilities of EUR3,625.2 million at 
March 31, 2012 was 2.9%. Ryanair's ability to obtain additional loans pursuant to each of the facilities to finance the 
price of future Boeing 737-800 aircraft purchases is subject to the issuance of further bank commitments and the 
satisfaction of various contractual conditions. These conditions include, among other things, the execution of 
satisfactory documentation, the requirement that Ryanair perform all of its obligations under the Boeing agreements 
and provide satisfactory security interests in the aircraft (and related assets) in favor of the lenders and Ex-Im Bank, 
and that Ryanair not suffer a material adverse change in its conditions or prospects (financial or otherwise).
 Ex-Im Bank's policy on facilities of this type is to issue a binding final commitment approximately six months prior to 
delivery of each aircraft being financed. Ex-Im Bank has already issued final binding commitments and related 
guarantees with respect to the 199 (net of 26 aircraft disposals) Ex-Im Bank-financed Boeing 737-800 aircraft 
delivered between 2001 and March 31, 2012. Ex-Im Bank's final binding commitment is also subject to certain 
conditions set forth in the documentation for facilities and the Ex-Im Bank guarantee. These conditions include, 
among other things, the execution of satisfactory documentation, the creation and maintenance of the lease and 
related arrangements described below, that Ryanair provide satisfactory security interests in the aircraft (and 
related assets) in favor of Ex-Im Bank and the lenders, and that the subject aircraft be registered in Ireland, be 
covered by adequate insurance and maintained in a manner acceptable to Ex-Im Bank. Ryanair expects that any 
future commitments or guarantees issued by Ex-Im Bank will contain similar conditions. The terms of the facilities 
and the Ex-Im Bank guarantee require that Ryanair pay certain fees in connection with such financings. In 
particular, these fees include arrangement fees paid to the facility arranger, and a commitment fee based on the 
unutilized and non-cancelled portion of the guarantee commencing 60 days from the date of issuance of the 
guarantee and payable semi-annually in arrears. An exposure fee for the issuance of the guarantee on the date of 
delivery is also payable to Ex-Im Bank (based on the amount of the guarantee). Ryanair's payment of the applicable 
exposure fee to Ex-Im Bank (based on the amount of the loan provided) is eligible for financing under the facilities. 
Ryanair anticipates that similar fees will be incurred as additional aircraft are delivered and financed.
 As part of its Ex-Im Bank guarantee-based financing of the Boeing 737-800s, Ryanair has entered into certain 
lease agreements and related arrangements. Pursuant to these arrangements, legal title to the 199 aircraft 
delivered and remaining in the fleet as of March 31, 2012 rests with a number of United States special purpose 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -42-
vehicles (the "SPVs") in which Ryanair has no equity or other interest. The SPVs are the borrowers of record under 
the loans made or to be made under the facilities, with all of their obligations under the loans being guaranteed by 
Ryanair Holdings.
 The shares of the SPVs (which are owned by an unrelated charitable association) are in turn pledged to a security 
trustee in favor of Ex-Im Bank and the lenders. Ryanair operates each of the aircraft pursuant to a finance lease it 
has entered into with the SPVs, the terms of which mirror those of the relevant loans under the facilities. Ryanair 
has the right to purchase the aircraft upon termination of the lease for a nominal amount. Pursuant to this 
arrangement, Ryanair is considered to own the aircraft for accounting purposes under IFRS. Ryanair does not use 
special purpose entities for off-balance sheet financing or any other purpose which results in assets or liabilities not 
being reflected in Ryanair's consolidated financial statements.
 As of July 20, 2012, Ryanair had mandated a lender to provide financing for up to seven of its firm-order Boeing 
737-800 aircraft under an Ex-Im Bank financing structure and the remaining four through the use of operating 
leases, including via sale-and-leaseback transactions. The future Ex-Im Bank guarantee-based financing will be 
substantially based on terms and conditions similar to those described above. However, no assurance can be given 
that such financing will be available to Ryanair, or that the terms of any such financing will be as advantageous to 
the Company as those available at the time of the facilities. Any inability of the Company to obtain financing for the 
new aircraft on advantageous terms could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and 
financial condition.
 The Company financed 72 of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft delivered between December 2003 and March 2012 
under seven-year, sale-and-leaseback arrangements with a number of international leasing companies, pursuant to 
which each lessor purchased an aircraft and leased it to Ryanair under an operating lease. Between October 2010 
and March 2012, 13 operating lease aircraft were returned to the lessor at the agreed maturity date of the lease. At 
March 31, 2012, Ryanair had 59 operating lease aircraft in the fleet. As a result, Ryanair operates, but does not 
own, these aircraft, which were leased to provide flexibility for the aircraft delivery program. Ryanair has no right or 
obligation to acquire these aircraft at the end of the relevant lease terms. Two of these leases are denominated in 
euro and require Ryanair to make variable rental payments that are linked to EURIBOR. Through the use of interest 
rate swaps, Ryanair has effectively converted the floating-rate rental payments due pursuant to these leases into 
fixed-rate rental payments. Thirty leases are denominated in euro and require Ryanair to make fixed rental 
payments over the term of the lease. The remaining 27 operating leases are U.S. dollar-denominated and two 
require Ryanair to make variable rental payments that are linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR, while a further 25 require 
Ryanair to make fixed rental payments. The Company has an option to extend the initial period of seven years on 
36 of the 59 remaining operating lease aircraft as of March 31, 2012, on pre-determined terms. Four operating 
lease arrangements will mature during the year ended March 31, 2013. The Company decided not to extend any of 
these operating leases for a secondary lease period and handed aircraft back to the lessors in April 2012. In 
addition to the above, the Company financed 30 of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft delivered between March 2005 and 
March 2012 with 13-year euro-denominated JOLCOs. These structures are accounted for as finance leases and 
are initially recorded at fair value in the Company's balance sheet. Under each of these contracts, Ryanair has a 
call option to purchase the aircraft at a pre-determined price after a period of 10.5 years, which it may exercise. Six 
aircraft have been financed through euro-denominated 12-year amortizing commercial debt transactions.
 Since, under each of the Company's operating leases, the Company has a commitment to maintain the relevant 
aircraft, an accounting provision is made during the lease term for this obligation based on estimated future costs of 
major airframe and certain engine maintenance checks by making appropriate charges to the income statement 
calculated by reference to the number of hours or cycles operated during the year. Under IFRS, the accounting 
treatment for these costs with respect to leased aircraft differs from that for aircraft owned by the Company, for 
which such costs are capitalized and amortized.
 In 2000, Ryanair purchased a Boeing 737-800 flight simulator from CAE Electronics Limited of Quebec, Canada 
("CAE"). The simulator is being used for pilot training purposes. The gross purchase price of the simulator and the 
necessary software was approximately $10 million, not taking into account certain price concessions provided by 
the seller in the form of credit memoranda. The Company financed this expenditure with a 10-year euro-
denominated loan provided by the Export Development Corporation of Canada for up to 85% of the net purchase 
price, with the remainder provided by cash flows from operations.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -42-
 In 2002, Ryanair entered into a contract to purchase three additional Boeing 737-800 flight simulators from CAE. 
The first of these simulators was delivered in 2004 and the second and third simulators were delivered in the 2008 
fiscal year. The gross price of each simulator was approximately $10.3 million, not taking into account certain price 
concessions provided by the seller in the form of credit memoranda. In September 2006 Ryanair entered into a new 
contract with CAE to purchase B737NG Level B flight simulators. Two such simulators were delivered in the 2009 
fiscal year. The gross price of each simulator is approximately $8 million, not taking into account certain price 
concessions provided by the seller in the form of credit memoranda and discounts.
 Contractual Obligations. The table below sets forth the contractual obligations and commercial commitments of the 
Company with definitive payment terms, which will require significant cash outlays in the future, as of March 31, 
2012. These obligations primarily relate to Ryanair's aircraft purchase and related financing obligations, which are 
described in more detail above. For additional information on the Company's contractual obligations and 
commercial commitments, see Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 18.
 The amounts listed under "Finance Lease Obligations" reflect the Company's obligations under its JOLCOs. See 
"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects[3/4]Liquidity and Capital Resources."

 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed across the 
Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment operations. In addition, as 
the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and liabilities have been allocated to the 
Company's single reportable segment.

The closure of European airspace in April and May 2010, due to the Icelandic volcanic ash disruption, resulted in 
the cancellation of 9,400 Ryanair flights. The impact on the Group's operating results totaled EUR50.0m (pre tax) 
for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, comprising EUR15.6m of operating expenses and EUR1.7m of finance 
expenses attributable to the period of flight disruption, together with estimated passenger compensation costs of 
EUR32.7m pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004 ('EU261'). The company subsequently reduced its estimate 
to a net of tax charge of EUR26.1m at year ended March 31, 2011. The Company's estimate of total passenger 
compensation costs has been determined based on actual claims received and processed to date together with 
probable future compensation payments and other related costs.

                   RYANAIR TO APPEAL ITALIAN COURT'S DECSION
                       TO BLOCK LOW FARES AND COMPETITON
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline today (Friday, 12th May 2006) stated
that it will appeal the decision of the regional administrative court of Lazio
to stop Ryanair and Easyjet's low fare flights on routes between mainland Italy
and Sardinia.
The Italian authorities blocked Ryanair's low fare flights between Rome and
Alghero by imposing a Public Service Obligation on the route in spite of the
fact that 2 airlines (Ryanair and Airone) were already operating year round
flights between Rome and Alghero. This is not allowed under European PSO rules.
These rules have also been abused by the Italian authorities because Alitalia is
being allowed to fly on PSO routes to Sardinia when it did not even apply to
operate them in the first place.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair appeals Italian Court
Speaking today Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications said:
        "We have instructed our lawyers to appeal this decision to the European
         courts to ensure that low fares and competition are allowed in Italy. It
         is astonishing that while Ryanair has been blocked from offering low
         fares between mainland Italy and Sardinia, Alitalia is being allowed to
         sell its high fares on PSO routes that it did not even apply for.
        "The PSO system in Europe is clearly out of control. It is being abused
         by national Governments to protect high fare flag carriers while at the
         same time blocking low fare competition. Italian consumers and visitors
         should not be forced to pay higher fares because the Italian authorities
         are abusing the PSO system to protect Alitalia and other high fare
         Italian airlines".

   Ideagen PLC
   ("Ideagen," "the Company" or the "Group")
   Exercise of Options, Issues of Shares and Total Voting Rights
   Ideagen PLC (AIM: IDEA), a leading supplier of Information Management Software to highly regulated industries, 
announces that it has allotted a total of 10,000 new ordinary shares of 1 penny each in the capital of the Company 
("Ordinary Shares") following the exercise of 10,000 options by employees.
   Application has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the 10,000 new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to 
trading on AIM ("Admission") and it is expected that Admission will become effective and trading will commence at 
8.00 a.m. on 2 September 2019.
   On Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue will be 219,814,235 and the total number of voting 
rights will therefore be 219,814,235. This figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the 
calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest 
in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure and Transparency Rules.

                  Management Discussion and Analysis of Results
Introduction
For the purposes of the MD&A all figures and comments are by reference to the
adjusted profit and loss account excluding the non-recurring costs and goodwill
referred to below.
Non-recurring costs consisted of Buzz re-organisation costs of EUR2.7m (net of
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results - Amend -3-
tax), and goodwill of EUR0.6m amounting to EUR3.3m (net of tax) in the quarter ended
June 30, 2003 compared to EUR0.6m of goodwill in the quarter ended June 30, 2004.
Profit after tax increased by 30% to EUR52.6m during the quarter compared to last
year. The adjusted profit for the quarter, excluding non-recurring costs and
goodwill, increased by 21% to EUR53.1m.
Summary Quarter Ended June 30, 2004
Profit after tax increased by 21% to EUR53.1m, compared to EUR43.8m in the previous
quarter ended June 30, 2003. These results were achieved by strong growth in
passenger volumes and continued tight cost control. Total operating revenues
increased by 23% to EUR302.8m, which is slower than the growth in passenger
volumes of 28%, and reflects the competitive fare environment, and the company's
objective of continuing to drive down average fares. The combination of lower
fares and the successful launch of new routes and the slower rate of growth
resulted in the Passenger Load Factor increasing from 78% to 83% during the
period.
Total operating expenses increased by 24% to EUR238.0m, due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs, primarily fuel, maintenance, route charges
and airport & handling costs associated with the growth of the airline.
Operating margins have remained stable due to the continuing tight control on
costs, which in turn resulted in Operating profit increasing by 22% from EUR53.1m
to EUR64.8m. Profit after tax has increased by 21%, slightly less than the growth
in Operating profit and reflects the higher net interest charge in the period
arising due to the increased level of debt and lower deposit interest earned.
Net Margins have remained at 18% for the quarter.
Earnings per share have risen in line with profit growth by 21% to 7.0 cent for
the quarter.
Balance Sheet
The strong profit growth continues to positively impact the balance sheet with
Cash and Liquid Resources growing despite funding an additional EUR60.5m in
capital expenditure from internal resources. Cash balances at June 30, 2004 were
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results - Amend -3-
EUR1,327.0m, an increase of EUR69.7m from March 31st 2004. No additional debt was
drawn down in the quarter whilst loan repayments resulted in debt levels
declining by EUR19.5m to EUR933.5m. Shareholders' Funds at June 30, 2004 have
increased to EUR1,508.0m, compared to EUR1,455.3m at March 31, 2004.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Quarter Ended June 30, 2004
Profit after tax, increased by 21% to EUR53.1m driven by strong growth in
passenger volumes and continued tight cost control. Operating margins have
remained stable at 21%, which has resulted in Operating profit increasing by
EUR11.7m to EUR64.8m compared to quarter ended June 30, 2003.
Total operating revenues increased by 23% to EUR302.84m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 28% to 6.6m.

unconditional in all respects, be despatched not later than 14 days after the
Cash Offer becomes or is declared unconditional in all respects, or thereafter
within 14 days of receipt of acceptance of the Cash Offer.
If Ryanair receives acceptances of the Cash Offer in respect of, and/or
otherwise acquires, 90 per cent. or more of the Aer Lingus Shares to which the
Cash Offer relates (and in the case where the Aer Lingus Shares to which the
Cash Offer relates are voting shares, not less than 90 per cent. of the voting
rights carried by those Aer Lingus Shares) and assuming all other conditions of
the Cash Offer have been satisfied or waived (if they are capable of being
waived), Ryanair intends to exercise its rights pursuant to the provisions of
Regulation 23 of the Takeover Regulations to acquire the remaining Aer Lingus
Shares to which the Cash Offer relates on the same terms as the Cash Offer.
As soon as it is appropriate and possible to do so and subject to the Offer
becoming or being declared unconditional in all respects, and subject to any
applicable requirements of the Irish Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange
or the UK Listing Authority, Ryanair intends to apply for the cancellation of
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus -5-
the listing of the Aer Lingus Shares on the Irish Stock Exchange and the UK
Official List and for the cancellation of admission to trading of Aer Lingus
Shares on the markets of the Irish Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange
and to propose a resolution to re-register Aer Lingus as a private company under
the relevant provisions of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983. If this
de-listing and cancellation occurs, it will significantly reduce the liquidity
and marketability of any Aer Lingus Shares not assented to the Cash Offer. It is
anticipated that the cancellations will take effect no earlier than 20 Business
Days from either the date Ryanair has acquired 75% of the voting rights in Aer
Lingus or on the first date of issue of compulsory acquisition notices by
Ryanair pursuant to Regulation 23 of the Takeover Regulations.

      circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable. No
     impairment to the carrying values of the Group's intangible assets has been
     recorded to date.
    Revenues
     Scheduled revenues comprise the invoiced value of airline and other
     services, net of government taxes. Revenue from the sale of flight seats is
     recognised in the period in which the service is provided. Unearned revenue
     represents flight seats sold but not yet flown and is included in accrued
     expenses and other liabilities. It is released to the income statement as
     passengers fly. Unused tickets are recognised as revenue on a systematic
     basis. Miscellaneous fees charged for any changes to flight tickets are
     recognised as revenue immediately.
    Ancillary revenues are recognised in the income statement in the period the
     ancillary services are provided.
    Foreign Currency Translation
     Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities
     are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which
     the entity operates (the "functional currency"). The consolidated financial
     statements are presented in Euro, which is the functional currency of each
     of the Group's entities.
    Transactions arising in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of
     exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
     liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
     retranslated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date
     and all related exchange gains or losses are accounted for through the
     income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
     currencies are translated to euro at foreign exchange rates ruling at the
     dates the transactions were effected.
    Pensions and Other Post Retirement Obligations
     The Group provides employees with post retirement benefits in the form of
Ryanair Holdings PLC ExplanationofFinancial -3-
     pensions. The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined
     benefit pension schemes.
    Costs arising in respect of the Group's defined contribution pension schemes
     are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are
     incurred.
    For defined contribution schemes, the Group recognises contributions due in
     respect of the accounting period in the income statement. Any contributions
     unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as a liability.
    The liabilities and costs associated with the Group's defined benefit
     pension schemes are assessed on the basis of the projected unit credit
     method by professionally qualified actuaries and are arrived at using
     actuarial assumptions based on market expectations at the balance sheet
     date. The discount rates employed in determining the present value of each
     scheme's liabilities are determined by reference to market yields at the
     balance sheet date of high quality corporate bonds in the same currency and
     term that is consistent with those of the associated pension obligations.
     The net surplus or deficit arising on the Group's defined benefit schemes is
     shown within non-current assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. The
     deferred tax impact of any such amount is disclosed separately within
     deferred tax.
    IAS 19 requires separate recognition of the operating and financing costs of
     defined benefit pensions (and similarly funded employee benefits) in the
     income statement. The standard permits a number of options for the
     recognition of actuarial gains and losses. In accordance with the exemption
     granted under IFRS 1, IAS 19 has not been applied retrospectively in
     preparing the Group's transition balance sheet to IFRS. All cumulative
     actuarial gains and losses as at the transition date (1 April 2004) have
     therefore been recognised in retained income at that date.
    Share Based Payments
     The Group engages in equity settled share-based payment transactions in
     respect of services received from certain of its employees. The fair value
     of the services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the
     share options granted on the date of the grant. The cost of the employee
     services received in respect of the share options granted is recognised in
     the income statement over the period that the services are received, which
     is the vesting period with a corresponding credit to equity. The fair value
     of the options granted is determined using the Binomial Lattice option
     pricing model, which takes into account the exercise price of the option,
     the current share price, the risk free interest rate, the expected
     volatility of the Ryanair Holdings plc share price over the life of the
     option and other relevant factors. Vesting conditions are taken into account
     by adjusting the number of shares or share options included in the
     measurement of the cost of employee services so that ultimately, the amount
     recognised in the income statement reflects the number of vested shares or
     share options
    In accordance with the transition provisions in IFRS 1, Ryanair has applied
     this fair value calculation to share option grants that were made after 7
     November 2002, but which had yet to vest by 1 January 2005.

     Explanation of the financial impact following adoption of IFRS
    Income taxes, including Deferred Income Taxes
     Income tax payable on taxable profits is recognised as an expense in the
     period in which the profits arise. Income tax recoverable on tax allowable
     losses is recognised as an asset only to the extent that it is probable that
     it will be recovered by offset against current or future taxable profits.
     Income tax is recognized in the income statement except to the extent that
     relates to items recognized directly in equity (derivative financial
     instruments and pensions and other post retirement obligations), in which
Ryanair Holdings PLC ExplanationofFinancial -3-
     case it is recognized in equity.
    Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on
     temporary timing differences arising from the tax bases of assets and
     liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
     statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and
     legislation enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and
     expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred
     tax liability is settled. The following temporary differences are not
     provided for: the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that effect
     neither accounting nor taxable profit and differences relating to
     investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable they will not
     reverse in the future.
    Deferred and current tax assets and liabilities are only offset when they
     arise in the same tax reporting Group and where there is both the legal
     right and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and
     settle the liability simultaneously.
    Leases
     Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all
     the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the Group, are
     capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over their estimated
     useful lives. The asset is recorded at the lower of its fair value, less
     accumulated depreciation, and the present value of the minimum lease
     payments at the inception of the finance lease. The present values of the
     future lease payments are recorded as obligations under finance leases and
     the interest element of the lease obligation is charged to the income
     statement over the period of the lease in proportion to the balances
     outstanding.
    Expenditure arising under operating leases (being leases where the lessor
     retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership) is charged to
     the income statement as incurred. The Group also enters into sale and
     leaseback transactions whereby it sells the rights to acquire aircraft to a
     third party and subsequently leases the aircraft back, by way of operating
     lease. Any profit on the disposal, where the price achieved on the disposal
     of the aircraft is not considered to be at fair value, is spread over the
     lease term. The profit or loss amount deferred is included within other
     creditors and analysed into its components of greater or less than one year.
    Aircraft Maintenance Costs
     The accounting for the cost of providing major airframe and certain engine
     maintenance checks for owned aircraft is described in the accounting policy
     for tangible fixed assets and depreciation. With respect to the Group's
     operating lease agreements, where the Group has a commitment to maintain the
     aircraft, provision is made during the lease term for the obligation based
     on estimated future costs of major airframe and certain engine maintenance
     checks by making appropriate charges to the income statement calculated by
     reference to the number of hours or cycles operated during the year.
    All other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

 financing facilities.
 Through the use of interest rate swaps or cross currency interest rate swaps, Ryanair has effectively converted a 
portion of its floating-rate debt under its financing facilities into fixed-rate debt. Approximately 44% of the loans for 
the aircraft acquired under the above facilities are not covered by such swaps and have therefore remained at 
floating rates linked to EURIBOR, with the interest rate exposure from these loans largely hedged by placing a 
similar amount of cash on deposit at floating interest rates. The net result is that Ryanair has effectively swapped or 
drawn down fixed-rate euro-denominated debt with maturities between 7 and 12 years in respect of approximately 
56% of its outstanding debt financing at March 31, 2011 and of this total approximately 31% of this debt has been 
partially swapped, with the relevant swaps covering the first 7 years of the 12-year amortizing period.
 The table below illustrates the effect of swap transactions (each of which is with an established international 
financial counterparty) on the profile of Ryanair's total outstanding debt at March 31, 2011. See "Item 11. 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Interest Rate Exposure and Hedging" for additional 
details on the Company's hedging transactions.

 ========  ==========
The weighted-average interest rate on the cumulative borrowings under these facilities of EUR3,649.4 million at 
March 31, 2011 was 2.9%. Ryanair's ability to obtain additional loans pursuant to each of the facilities to finance the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -40-
price of future Boeing 737-800 aircraft purchases is subject to the issuance of further bank commitments and the 
satisfaction of various contractual conditions. These conditions include, among other things, the execution of 
satisfactory documentation, the requirement that Ryanair perform all of its obligations under the Boeing agreements 
and provide satisfactory security interests in the aircraft (and related assets) in favor of the lenders and Ex-Im Bank, 
and that Ryanair not suffer a material adverse change in its conditions or prospects (financial or otherwise).
 Ex-Im Bank's policy on facilities of this type is to issue a binding final commitment approximately six months prior to 
delivery of each aircraft being financed. Ex-Im Bank has already issued final binding commitments and related 
guarantees with respect to the 185 (net of 25 aircraft disposals) Ex-Im Bank-financed Boeing 737-800 aircraft 
delivered between 2000 and March 31, 2011. Ex-Im Bank's final binding commitment is also subject to certain 
conditions set forth in the documentation for facilities and the Ex-Im Bank guarantee. These conditions include, 
among other things, the execution of satisfactory documentation, the creation and maintenance of the lease and 
related arrangements described below, that Ryanair provide satisfactory security interests in the aircraft (and 
related assets) in favor of Ex-Im Bank and the lenders, and that the subject aircraft be registered in Ireland, be 
covered by adequate insurance and maintained in a manner acceptable to Ex-Im Bank. Ryanair expects that any 
future commitments or guarantees issued by Ex-Im Bank will contain similar conditions. The terms of the facilities 
and the Ex-Im Bank guarantee require that Ryanair pay certain fees in connection with such financings. In 
particular, these fees include arrangement fees paid to the facility arranger, and a commitment fee based on the 
unutilized and non-cancelled portion of the guarantee commencing 60 days from the date of issuance of the 
guarantee and payable semi-annually in arrears. An exposure fee for the issuance of the guarantee on the date of 
delivery is also payable to Ex-Im Bank (based on the amount of the guarantee). Ryanair's payment of the applicable 
exposure fee to Ex-Im Bank (based on the amount of the loan provided) is eligible for financing under the facilities. 
Ryanair anticipates that similar fees will be incurred as additional aircraft are delivered and financed.
 As part of its Ex-Im Bank guarantee-based financing of the Boeing 737-800s, Ryanair has entered into certain 
lease agreements and related arrangements. Pursuant to these arrangements, legal title to the 185 aircraft 
delivered and remaining in the fleet as of March 31, 2011 rests with a number of United States special purpose 
vehicles (the "SPVs") in which Ryanair has no equity or other interest. The SPVs are the borrowers of record under 
the loans made or to be made under the facilities, with all of their obligations under the loans being guaranteed by 
Ryanair Holdings.
 The shares of the SPVs (which are owned by an unrelated charitable association) are in turn pledged to a security 
trustee in favor of Ex-Im Bank and the lenders. Ryanair operates each of the aircraft pursuant to a finance lease it 
has entered into with the SPVs, the terms of which mirror those of the relevant loans under the facilities. Ryanair 
has the right to purchase the aircraft upon termination of the lease for a nominal amount. Pursuant to this 
arrangement, Ryanair is considered to own the aircraft for accounting purposes under IFRS. Ryanair does not use 
special purpose entities for off-balance sheet financing or any other purpose which results in assets or liabilities not 
being reflected in Ryanair's consolidated financial statements.
 At June 30, 2011, Ryanair had mandated a lender to provide financing for up to five of its firm-order Boeing 737-
800 aircraft under a sale and leaseback transaction. The Company expects to finance the remaining 35 Boeing 
737-800 aircraft it is obligated to purchase under its contracts with Boeing by November 2012 through the use of 
similar financing arrangements based on Ex-Im Bank guarantees, bank debt provided by commercial banks, and 
finance and operating leases, including via sale-and-leaseback transactions such as those described below, other 
capital markets products, as well as cash flow generated from the Company's operations. It is expected that any 
future Ex-Im Bank guarantee-based financing will also be subject to terms and conditions similar to those described 
above. However, no assurance can be given that such financing will be available to Ryanair, or that the terms of 
any such financing will be as advantageous to the Company as those available at the time of the facilities. Any 
inability of the Company to obtain financing for the new aircraft on advantageous terms could have a material 
adverse effect on its business, results of operation and financial condition.
 The Company financed 61 of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft delivered between December 2003 and March 2011 
under seven-year, sale-and-leaseback arrangements with a number of international leasing companies, pursuant to 
which each lessor purchased an aircraft and leased it to Ryanair under an operating lease. Between October 2010 
and March 2011, 10 operating lease aircraft were returned to the lessor at the agreed maturity date of the lease. At 
March 31, 2011, Ryanair had 51 operating lease aircraft in the fleet. As a result, Ryanair operates, but does not 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -40-
own, these aircraft, which were leased to provide flexibility for the aircraft delivery program. Ryanair has no right or 
obligation to acquire these aircraft at the end of the relevant lease terms. Five of these leases are denominated in 
euro and require Ryanair to make variable rental payments that are linked to EURIBOR. Through the use of interest 
rate swaps, Ryanair has effectively converted the floating-rate rental payments due under two of the remaining five 
leases into fixed-rate rental payments. Thirty of these leases are denominated in euro and require Ryanair to make 
fixed rental payments over the term of the lease. The remaining sixteen operating leases are U.S. dollar-
denominated and two require Ryanair to make variable rental payments that are linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR, while 
a further 14 require Ryanair to make fixed rental payments. The Company has an option to extend the initial period 
of seven years on 28 of the 51 remaining operating lease aircraft as at March 31, 2011, on pre-determined terms. 
Three operating lease arrangements will mature during the year ended March 31, 2012. The Company has decided 
not to extend any of these operating leases for a secondary lease period. In addition to the above, the Company 
financed 30 of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft delivered between March 2005 and March 2011 with 13-year euro-
denominated JOLCOs. These structures are accounted for as finance leases and are initially recorded at fair value 
in the Company's balance sheet. Under each of these contracts, Ryanair has a call option to purchase the aircraft 
at a pre-determined price after a period of 10.5 years, which it may exercise. Six aircraft have been financed 
through euro-denominated 12-year amortizing commercial debt transactions.

                  Management Discussion and Analysis of Results
Introduction
For the purposes of the MD&A all figures and comments are by reference to the
adjusted profit and loss account excluding the non-recurring costs and goodwill
referred to below.
Non-recurring costs consisted of Buzz re-organisation costs of EUR2.7m (net of
tax), and goodwill of EUR0.6m amounting to EUR3.3m (net of tax) in the quarter ended
June 30, 2003 compared to EUR0.6m of goodwill in the quarter ended June 30, 2004.
Profit after tax increased by 30% to EUR52.6m during the quarter compared to last
year. The adjusted profit for the quarter, excluding non-recurring costs and
goodwill, increased by 21% to EUR53.1m.
Summary Quarter Ended June 30, 2004
Profit after tax increased by 21% to EUR53.1m, compared to EUR43.8m in the previous
quarter ended June 30, 2003. These results were achieved by strong growth in
passenger volumes and continued tight cost control. Total operating revenues
increased by 23% to EUR302.8m, which is slower than the growth in passenger
volumes of 28%, and reflects the competitive fare environment, and the company's
objective of continuing to drive down average fares. The combination of lower
fares and the successful launch of new routes and the slower rate of growth
resulted in the Passenger Load Factor increasing from 78% to 83% during the
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -3-
period.
Total operating expenses increased by 24% to EUR238.0m, due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs, primarily fuel, maintenance, route charges
and airport & handling costs associated with the growth of the airline.
Operating margins have remained stable due to the continuing tight control on
costs, which in turn resulted in Operating profit increasing by 22% from EUR53.1m
to EUR64.8m. Profit after tax has increased by 21%, slightly less than the growth
in Operating profit and reflects the higher net interest charge in the period
arising due to the increased level of debt and lower deposit interest earned.
Net Margins have remained at 18% for the quarter.
Earnings per share have risen in line with profit growth by 21% to 7.0 cent for
the quarter.
Balance Sheet
The strong profit growth continues to positively impact the balance sheet with
Cash and Liquid Resources growing despite funding an additional EUR60.5m in
capital expenditure from internal resources. Cash balances at June 30, 2004 were
EUR1,327.0m, an increase of EUR69.7m from March 31st 2004. No additional debt was
drawn down in the quarter whilst loan repayments resulted in debt levels
declining by EUR19.5m to EUR933.5m. Shareholders' Funds at June 30, 2004 have
increased to EUR1,508.0m, compared to EUR1,455.3m at March 31, 2004.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Quarter Ended June 30, 2004
Profit after tax, increased by 21% to EUR53.1m driven by strong growth in
passenger volumes and continued tight cost control. Operating margins have
remained stable at 21%, which has resulted in Operating profit increasing by
EUR11.7m to EUR64.8m compared to quarter ended June 30, 2003.
Total operating revenues increased by 23% to EUR302.84m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 28% to 6.6m.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 21% to EUR259.1m due to a combination of
increased passenger numbers on existing routes, the successful launch of new
bases at Rome-Ciampino and Barcelona-Girona, and the commencement of 7 new
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -3-
routes in April '04, primarily offset by a 6% reduction in average fares. The
strong growth in passenger volumes is also reflected in the improvement in the
load factor achieved, which rose from 78% to 83% in the quarter.
Ancillary revenues increased by 40% to EUR43.7m, reflecting strong growth in
non-flight scheduled revenues, car rentals and other ancillary products.
Ancillary revenues continue to grow at a faster rate than passenger volumes and
accounted for 14% of total revenues during the period compared to 13% last year.
Total operating expenses increased by 24% to EUR238.0m due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs primarily maintenance, fuel, aircraft
rentals, route charges and airport and handling costs associated with the growth
of the airline. Increases in total operating expenses due to the higher level of
activity were partly offset by the positive impact of the strength of the euro

legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed 
or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a

financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row 
free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).

are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.

EUR4,856.0 million) were mortgaged to lenders as security for loans. Under the security arrangements for 
the Company's new Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft, the Company does not hold legal title to 
those aircraft while these loan amounts remain outstanding.
 At March 31, 2014, the cost and net book value of aircraft included advance payments on aircraft of 
EUR282.1 million (2013: Nil; 2012: EUR110.5 million).  Such amounts, where present, are not depreciated. 
The cost and net book value also includes capitalised aircraft maintenance, aircraft simulators and the 
stock of rotable spare parts.

 rights......................................................................................      46.8   
46.8   46.8
 =====  =====  =====
Landing slots were acquired with the acquisition of Buzz Stansted Limited in April 2003. As these landing 
slots have no expiry date and are expected to be used in perpetuity, they are considered to be of 
indefinite life and accordingly are not amortised. The Company also considers that there has been no 
impairment of the value of these rights to date. The recoverable amount of these rights has been 
determined on a value-in-use basis, using discounted cash-flow projections for a twenty-year period for 
each route that has an individual landing right. The calculation of value-in-use is most sensitive to the 
operating margin and discount rate assumptions. Operating margins are based on the existing margins 
generated from these routes and adjusted for any known trading conditions. The trading environment is 
subject to both regulatory and competitive pressures that can have a material effect on the operating 
performance of the business. Foreseeable events, however, are unlikely to result in a change of 
projections of a significant nature so as to result in the landing rights' carrying amounts exceeding 
their recoverable amounts. These projections have been discounted based on the estimated discount rate 
applicable to the asset of 5.3% for 2014, 7.0% for 2013, and 7.7% for 2012.

 ======  ======  ======
As at March 31, 2014 Ryanair's total percentage shareholding in Aer Lingus was 29.8% (2013: 29.8%; 2012: 
29.8%). The balance sheet value of EUR260.3 million (2013: EUR221.2 million; 2012: EUR149.7 million) reflects 
the market value of this investment as at March 31, 2014. In accordance with the Company's accounting policy, this 
asset is held at fair value with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income following initial 
acquisition. Any impairment losses that arise are recognised in the income statement and are not subsequently 
reversed.  Any cumulative loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income 
statement once an impairment is considered to have occurred.

    RYANAIR GUARANTEES NO PRICE FIXING, NO FUEL SURCHARGES, JUST THE LOWEST
                                  FARES...ALWAYS
    Releases 2.7m tickets for just GBP10* to mark BA's GBP270m price fixing fine
Ryanair, Britain's largest airline today (Friday, 3rd August 2007) called on
both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic to immediately remove their unnecessary
and unjustified fuel surcharges. Ryanair, which this year will carry over 50m
passengers is the only airline to guarantee its passenger will not now or ever
levy a fuel surcharge. Ryanair is also the only airline in Britain to guarantee
the lowest fares. On every route which Ryanair operates, passengers can obtain a
double the difference refund if they can find a lower fare for any similar
itinerary, with any competitor airline. To date very few claims have been made
under this guarantee, because Ryanair almost always offers the lowest fares,
with a guarantee of no fuel surcharges and a guarantee of no price fixing
either.
Ryanair Holdings PLC GUARANTEED NO PRICE FIXING
Speaking at this morning's press conference, Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary
said:
    "There is only one way that British passengers and visitors can guarantee
     that they are getting the lowest fare, guarantee that they won't suffer a
     fuel surcharge and guarantee that they won't be subject to price fixing and
     that is to book with Ryanair, Britain's favourite airline.
    "To mark a week when British Airways and Virgin Atlantic admitted to price
     fixing and overcharging passengers, Ryanair is releasing 2.7m seats for
     travel through September, October and November this year at an all inclusive
     price of just GBP10* one way. This GBP10* fare includes all taxes, fees and
     charges, with a guarantee of no price fixing and no fuel surcharges either.
     The fuel surcharges levied by British Airways, Virgin Atlantic are just
     their latest price fixing scam. The flag carrier airlines have been price
     fixing for years, which is why they regularly apply for and obtain
     anti-trust immunity from both the US and European authorities.
    "Ryanair's fares are significantly lower than BA's and yet we guarantee no
     fuel surcharges. If we can do it, then there is no justification for BA's
     fuel surcharges, which are just a hidden fare increase which should be
     included in BA's fares. Passengers have no choice in avoiding these unfair
     fuel surcharges which are just another rip off of the travelling public by
     British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and others.
    "This week's revelations that BA was engaged in price fixing, as well as
     losing thousands of passengers bags proves yet again that passengers who
     want a fair fare should fly with Ryanair, the only airline that delivers the
     lowest fares, the best punctuality, the youngest fleet of aircraft, with a
     guarantee of no price fixing and no fuel surcharges either".
These 2.7m GBP10* fares will sell out quickly, so passengers who want to avail of
them should book this week at www.ryanair.com.
*Terms and conditions apply

 Co Dublin
 20 October 2011
 Dear Michael,
 I refer to your recent letters, particularly your letter of 28 September 2011.
 My letter of 22 September provided a comprehensive response to the points contained in your letter of 13 
September. This included detailed statements of the views of the Board of Aer Lingus on pensions, on 
dividends and on the "leave and return" review. Aer Lingus management representatives addressed these same 
issues again in some detail when your representative raised them while disrupting our recent investor day 
in London.
 In my letter of 22 September I also strongly refuted your false allegations that Aer Lingus does not 
listen to its shareholders or consider their views. We disagree with your views on the issues referred to 
above and don't intend to engage in further public debate with you on them. Such public debate with a 
single self interested shareholder is not in the best interests of all our shareholders.
 You have not made any substantive new points on these issues in your letter of 28 September. In addition, 
you appear intent on ignoring our previous responses on these matters simply because the facts we have 
outlined and the views we have expressed are at variance with your own stated opinions. I disagree with 
your contention that your letter was "an open and genuine effort...to enhance shareholder value".
 The "initiatives" referred to in your letter of 18 October are not new. You raised each of these matters 
at our AGM in May. In advance of the AGM you also sought to require Aer Lingus to include resolutions on 
the AGM agenda relating to two of these matters and this attempt was rejected by the High Court. Your 
current intention to requisition an EGM relates principally to these same matters. Therefore, I disagree 
with the contention that your "initiatives" and proposed requisitioning of an EGM will "boost shareholder 
value". We believe that the context in which you frame your proposals is a continuing attempt to de-focus 
and distract management with consequent potential implications for performance and, as such, are not in 
the best interests of ALL shareholders. We are and continue to be resolutely focused on the creation of 
value through a series of initiatives again for ALL shareholders.
 Since I joined the Board of Aer Lingus three years ago, we have made very substantial changes at Aer 
Lingus, changes that were reflected in our significantly improved financial results in 2010 - a EUR139 
million turnaround in operating profits from the prior year - and again in 2011 YTD. We have also improved 
our cash position to over EUR900 million - this despite your own repeated warnings to our shareholders and 
others that: "...Aer Lingus is going to run out of cash".
 In the last two and a half years we have also:
 --      Strengthened our board by recruiting directors qualified in several fields relevant to the 
success of the Company;
 --      Strengthened our senior management team by recruiting and developing experienced executives from 
both outside and within the Company;
 --      Increased our free share float by enabling the ESOT shares to be distributed to individual 
shareholders;
 --      Adopted a demand led approach to capacity management and focused on yield per seat rather than 
merely on load factor;
 --      Repositioned our customer offering to provide an even more attractive range of products than our 
major competitors;
 --      Focussed on inter-connectivity between our long and short haul operations and on alliances and 
partnerships;
 --      Focussed on Dublin as a hub, and particularly by recognising and utilizing the benefits of T2;
 --      Redeveloped a multi channel distribution strategy;
 --      Further reduced our cost base through the modernization of work practices and the lower costs 
produced by Greenfield (and the benefits of the 2008 "Leave and Return" scheme);
 --      Rationalised our route structure by eliminating loss making routes, including those to Washington 
D.C. and San Francisco, and rationalising operations at Shannon, Belfast and London Gatwick in order to 
make these bases profitable in conformity with the principles outlined above; and
 --      Rationalised our fleet and aircraft orders in order to align our future fleet with our expected 
business, and preserve and grow our cash.
Aer Lingus Group PLC Response to further Ryanair correspondence
 I'm sure that you will recognise some of these activities - especially base flexibility - as similar to 
those adopted by Ryanair on a day-to-day basis and will agree that they are geared towards creating long 
term shareholder value. I expect such value enhancement will be available to Ryanair and to all our 
shareholders as we make further improvements at Aer Lingus and as global and domestic market conditions 
improve.
 Regarding your points about Aer Lingus' share price, it was your decision to invest your shareholders 
funds to purchase Aer Lingus shares in 2006, with the stated intention of acquiring control of the 
company. This intention was rejected twice by Aer Lingus' other shareholders and by competition 
authorities. It could never succeed and it is our view that the shareholding cannot be maintained in the 
long term. It is also our view that Ryanair's shareholding has had a significantly detrimental impact on 
Aer Lingus' share price.
 If Ryanair is truly interested in disposing of its shareholding in Aer Lingus, we re-iterate our 
willingness to have constructive discussions with you on this issue.
 Sincerely,
 Colm Barrington
 Chairman

 13. Shareholder distributions
 In the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company bought back 24.6M ordinary shares at a total cost of 
EUR288M under its EUR400M share buy-back programme which commenced in February 2015 and ended in August 
2015 and 29.1M ordinary shares at a total cost of EUR418M under its EUR800M share buyback which commenced 
in February 2016. This was equivalent to approximately 3.9% of the Company's issued share capital. 53.2M 
of these ordinary shares repurchased were cancelled at March 31, 2016. The remaining 0.5M ordinary shares 
were cancelled on April 1, 2016.  Accordingly, share capital decreased by 53.2M ordinary shares with a 
nominal value of EUR0.3M and the capital redemption reserve increased by a corresponding EUR0.3M.  The 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -7-
capital redemption reserve is required to be created under Irish law to preserve permanent capital in the 
Parent Company.
 In addition to the above, the Company returned EUR398M to shareholders via a B Share scheme, and 
completed a capital reorganisation which involved the consolidation of its ordinary share capital on a 39 
for 40 basis which resulted in the reduction of ordinary shares in issue by 33.8M ordinary shares to 
1,319.3M. The nominal value of an ordinary share was also reduced from EUR0.00635 each to EUR0.00600 each 
under the reorganisation. All 'B' Shares and Deferred Shares issued in connection with the B Share scheme 
were either redeemed or cancelled during the period such that there were no 'B' Shares or Deferred Shares 
remaining in issue as at March 31, 2016.
 In the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company bought back 10.9M ordinary shares at a total cost of 
EUR112M under its EUR400M share buyback programme referred to above.  This was equivalent to approximately 
0.8% of the Company's issued share capital.  All ordinary shares repurchased were cancelled.
 14.          Related party transactions
 The Company has related party relationships with its subsidiaries, directors and senior key management 
personnel. All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
 There were no related party transactions in the year ended March 31, 2016 that materially affected the 
financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no changes in the 
related party transactions described in the 2015 Annual Report that could have a material effect on the 
financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.
 15.          Post balance sheet events
 Between April 1, 2016 and May 19, 2016 the Company had bought back 17.5M ordinary shares at a total cost 
of EUR238.7M under its EUR800M share buyback which commenced in February 2016.  This was equivalent to 
1.4% of the Company's issued share capital at March 31, 2016.  All ordinary shares repurchased are 
cancelled.

Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Tuesday, 3rd August 2004)
announced record profits for Q1 ended 30 June 2004 of EUR53.1m. Passenger volumes
grew by a record 28% to 6.6m passengers whilst yields declined by 6% during the

the re-organisation of "Buzz" in April 2003 of EUR2.7m (net of tax) and goodwill
charges arising of EUR0.6m in both the quarters ended 30 June 2003 and 2004.
Announcing these results, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
        "These record quarterly results reflect the continued disciplined roll
         out of Ryanair's low fares model. Passenger volumes grew by 28% to 6.6m
         in the quarter and we carried more passengers in 3 months than the total
         traffic carried by Aer Lingus in a full year. Our two new bases at Rome
         Ciampino and Barcelona Girona have performed particularly well.
         Ryanair's strong performance is also reflected in the recent increases
         in monthly traffic and load factors.
        "Yields were 6% lower than last year, a decline that was towards the
         lower end of our -5% to -10% guidance. Our forward yield guidance
         remains unchanged. In Quarter 2 we anticipate a yield decline of between
         -5% to -10%. Next winter, we expect the yield decline to be in the -10%
         to - 20% range as chronically loss making competitors will continue to
         dump prices, resulting in even more airline casualties this winter.
        "The higher oil prices have continued through the summer and unlike many
         high fare flag competitors, we have not imposed fuel surcharges. We
         remain almost fully hedged until the end of Quarter 2 but largely
         unhedged thereafter. We believe that over the medium term prices will
         fall and therefore it would be unwise to lock-in at the current high
         rates. We anticipate that we will be able to largely offset these higher
         oil prices in this fiscal year by making cost savings in other areas.
        "We have announced a major expansion of our London Luton base from 1 to
         4 aircraft. In addition to our successful Dublin and Milan routes, we
         will now fly from Luton to Barcelona Girona, Barcelona Reus, and Murcia
         in Spain, Dinard and Nimes in France, Esjberg in Denmark, Rome Ciampino
         and Venice in Italy, and Stockholm in Sweden. We have also announced two
         new routes from London Stansted to Santander and Zaragossa in Spain and
         continue to grow our base at Rome Ciampino launching new routes to
         Santander in Spain, Paris-Beauvais and Eindhoven in Holland. We also
         have launched our expansion into the new EU member countries and will
         start 3 routes from Riga - the capital city of Latvia - to London,
         Tampere and Frankfurt on 30 October next. Many more airports continue to
         encourage Ryanair to launch new routes and as usual we have far more
         offers than we can presently handle and this will drive down airport
         costs.
        "Unit costs fell by 4% during the quarter (excluding fuel and route
         charges unit costs fell by 5.4%). We continue to benefit from the
         ongoing introduction of the larger 737-800's as they replace the
         remaining thirteen 737-200's. The remaining 737-200's will be retired by
         December 2005. We continue to focus on lowering our cost base and pass
         on these lower costs in the form of even lower fares to our passengers.
        "The legislation recently introduced by the Irish government to break up
         Aer Rianta will enable (for the first time ever) all of the government
         owned Irish airports to compete on a level playing field. We welcome
         this much delayed legislation and encourage the Minister to quickly
         introduce competition at Dublin airport by directing the construction of
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results - Amend
         a second and third competing terminals. This initiative will finally
         introduce competition, will result in lower prices, deliver better
         facilities, and bring millions more visitors to Ireland.
        "We have recently filed proceedings in the High Court in London for the
         recovery of overcharging on fuel levies by BAA plc, the monopoly
         operator of London's three major airports. The BAA has been charging a
         fuel levy since 1991, which was agreed at the time to recover the GBP12.5m
         cost of the fuel hydrant system. Since that date, thanks to Ryanair's
         enormous growth, BAA has recovered over GBP39m in fuel levies or more than
         three times the original cost and yet this extortionate levy remains
         unchanged. BAA have also issued Court proceedings arising out of the
         fuel levy dispute and we look forward to the Court's ruling on the BAA
         overcharging. Ryanair continues to oppose anti-consumer charges at these
         monopoly airports. It is untenable for the BAA airport monopoly to
         impose fuel levies in excess of 300% of cost on its low fare consumers,
         whilst at the same time providing free of charge car parking to
         politicians. This anti-consumer rip-off must end.
        "We continue to be cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the
         year. We expect to achieve passenger volume growth this fiscal year in
         the order of 20% and deliver increased load factors. We believe that
         yield attrition this winter will be within our forecast range of -10% to
         -20%. The reality is that the high cost, high fare airlines, and those
         so called low fare loss makers are unable to compete with Ryanair's low
         fares, low cost base and industry leading customer service. As Southwest
         has repeatedly demonstrated in the US for many years, the lowest cost
         carrier always wins."

 The shares of the SPVs (which are owned by an unrelated charitable association) are in turn pledged to a security 
trustee in favor of Ex-Im Bank and the lenders. Ryanair operates each of the aircraft pursuant to a finance lease it 
has entered into with the SPVs, the terms of which mirror those of the relevant loans under the facilities. Ryanair 
has the right to purchase the aircraft upon termination of the lease for a nominal amount. Pursuant to this 
arrangement, Ryanair is considered to own the aircraft for accounting purposes under IFRS. Ryanair does not use 
special purpose entities for off-balance sheet financing or any other purpose which results in assets or liabilities not 
being reflected in Ryanair's consolidated financial statements.
 Ryanair has a track record in securing finance for similar sized aircraft purchases. The 1998, 2002, 2003 and 2005 
Boeing Contracts totaling 348 aircraft were financed with approximately 66% US Ex-Im Bank loan guarantees and 
capital markets (with 85% loan to value) financing, 24% through sale and operating leaseback financing, and 10% 
through Japanese operating leases with call options ("JOLCOs"). See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and 
Prospects-Liquidity and Capital Resources."
 Under the new Aviation Sector Understanding which came into effect from January 1, 2013, the fees payable to 
Ex-Im Bank for the provision of loan guarantees have significantly increased, thereby making it more expensive 
than more traditional forms of financing. As a result, Ryanair intends to finance the new aircraft obtained under the 
2013 Boeing Contract through a combination of internally generated cash flows, debt financing from commercial 
banks, debt financing through the capital markets in a secured and unsecured manner, commercial debt through 
JOLCOs and sale and operating leasebacks. These forms of financing are generally accepted in the aviation 
industry and are currently widely available for companies who have the credit quality of Ryanair. Ryanair may 
periodically use Ex-Im Bank loan guarantees when appropriate. Ryanair intends to finance pre-delivery payments 
("Aircraft Deposits") to Boeing in respect of the New Aircraft via internally generated cash flows similar to all 
previous Aircraft Deposit payments.
 Using the debt capital markets to finance the 2013 Boeing Contract may require the Company to obtain a credit 
rating or potentially to obtain a credit rating for specific debt transactions, for example using an Enhanced 
Equipment Trust Certificate ("EETC"), a structured product that is widely used in the US to finance aircraft 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -41-
deliveries. The requirement for a credit rating depends amongst other things on whether Ryanair finances the 
aircraft via secured funding or through general corporate purposes.
 At March 31, 2013, Ryanair had 59 operating lease aircraft in the fleet. As a result, Ryanair operates, but does not 
own, these aircraft, which were leased to provide flexibility for the aircraft delivery program. Ryanair has no right or 
obligation to acquire these aircraft at the end of the relevant lease terms. 30 leases are denominated in euro and 
require Ryanair to make fixed rental payments over the term of the lease. The remaining 29 operating leases are 
U.S. dollar-denominated and require Ryanair to make fixed rental payments. The Company has an option to extend 
the initial period of seven years on 41 of the 59 remaining operating lease aircraft as of March 31, 2013, on pre-
determined terms. 15 operating lease arrangements will mature during the year ended March 31, 2014. In April 
2013, the Company decided not to extend two leases that were maturing and handed these aircraft back to the 
lessor. In addition to the above, the Company financed 30 of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft delivered between March 
2005 and March 2013 with 13-year euro-denominated JOLCOs. These structures are accounted for as finance 
leases and are initially recorded at fair value in the Company's balance sheet. Under each of these contracts, 
Ryanair has a call option to purchase the aircraft at a pre-determined price after a period of 10.5 years, which it may 
exercise. Six aircraft have been financed through euro-denominated 12-year amortizing commercial debt 
transactions.
 Since, under each of the Company's operating leases, the Company has a commitment to maintain the relevant 
aircraft, an accounting provision is made during the lease term for this obligation based on estimated future costs of 
major airframe and certain engine maintenance checks by making appropriate charges to the income statement 
calculated by reference to the number of hours or cycles operated during the year. Under IFRS, the accounting 
treatment for these costs with respect to leased aircraft differs from that for aircraft owned by the Company, for 
which such costs are capitalized and amortized.
 Contractual Obligations. The table below sets forth the contractual obligations and commercial commitments of the 
Company with definitive payment terms, which will require significant cash outlays in the future, as of March 31, 
2013. These obligations primarily relate to Ryanair's aircraft purchase and related financing obligations, which are 
described in more detail above. For additional information on the Company's contractual obligations and 
commercial commitments, see Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 18.
 The amounts listed under "Finance Lease Obligations" reflect the Company's obligations under its JOLCOs. See 
"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects3/4 Liquidity and Capital Resources."
 The amounts listed under "Purchase Obligations" in the table reflect obligations for aircraft purchases and are 
calculated by multiplying the number of aircraft the Company is obligated to purchase under its current agreements 
with Boeing during the relevant period by the Basic Price for each aircraft pursuant to the relevant contract, with the 
dollar-denominated Basic Price being converted into euro at an exchange rate of $1.2805=EUR1.00 (based on the 
European Central Bank Rate on March 31, 2013). The relevant amounts therefore exclude the effect of the price 
concessions granted to Ryanair by Boeing and CFM, as well as any application of the Escalation Factor described 
below. As a result, Ryanair's actual expenditures for aircraft during the relevant periods will be lower than the 
amounts listed under "Purchase Obligations" in the table.
 With respect to purchase obligations under the terms of the 2013 Boeing contract, the Company was required to 
pay Boeing 1% of the Basic Price of each of the 175 firm-order Boeing 737-800 aircraft at the time the contract was 
signed in April 2013 (such deposit being fully refundable if the Company had not received the shareholder approval 
it received at an extraordinary general meeting on June 18, 2013), and will be required to make periodic advance 
payments of the purchase price for each aircraft it has agreed to purchase during the course of the two-year period 
preceding the delivery of each aircraft. As a result of these required advance payments, the Company will have paid 
up to 30% of the Basic Price of each aircraft prior to its delivery (including the addition of an estimated "Escalation 
Factor" but before deduction of any credit memoranda and other concessions); the balance of the net price is due 
at the time of delivery. Similar terms applied under the 2005 Boeing contract, with the first payment due when the 
contract was signed in February 2005.
 The amounts listed under "Operating Lease Obligations" reflect the Company's obligations under its aircraft 
operating lease arrangements.

 OFF-BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS
 Ryanair uses certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, including

                   HIGH FARE AIRLINES ARE STILL PROFITEERING
                     FROM FUEL SURCHARGES AS FUEL PRICES FALL
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (Thursday, 9th December 2004)
criticised Europe's high fares airlines for continuing to price gouge consumers
with ridiculous fuel surcharges, even though oil prices have fallen by over 30%
to less than $40 per barrel in recent weeks.
                             FUEL SURCHARGE              AVERAGE FARE

(Source: Ryanair 12 months to March 04, latest published annual reports &
published information)
Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
        "When fuel prices started to increase last year, BA, Air France, KLM and
         Lufthansa were very quick to penalise consumers through extortionate
Ryanair Holdings PLC Fuel Surcharges Press Release
         fuel surcharges. Not content with just one fuel surcharge, airlines like
         BA have introduced THREE separate fuel surcharge increases to
         passengers.
        "Fuel prices have now reduced by 30%, and still this profiteering by
         high fares airlines continues.
        "Consumers can rest assured that Ryanair, which GUARANTEED to never
         introduce fuel surcharges, is committed to lowering fares to consumers,
         not increasing them. It is no wonder millions of consumers are choosing
         Ryanair because only Ryanair offers passengers Europe's lowest fares,
         unbeatable punctuality and customer service and GUARANTEED no fuel
         surcharges. It is time these already high fares airlines stop
         profiteering from fuel surcharges".
Ends.                          Thursday, 9th December 2004

by a lower amortisation charge due to the retirement of 737-200 aircraft and the
positive impact of a new engine maintenance deal on the cost of amortisation of
737-800 aircraft. The strengthening of the Euro to US$ also had a positive
impact on the depreciation and amortisation charge relating to new aircraft
deliveries.
Fuel costs rose by 105% to EUR127.0m due to an increase in the number of sectors
flown, an 8% increase in sector length, and a significantly higher average US$
cost per gallon of fuel partially offset by the positive impact of the
strengthening of the Euro to the US$ during the period.
Maintenance costs increased by 4% to EUR11.2m reflecting the improved reliability
arising from the higher proportion of 737-800 operated and a lower level of
maintenance costs incurred due to the return of six 737-300's and the positive
impact of the strengthening of the Euro exchange rate, partially offset by an
increase in the number of leased 737-800 aircraft from 10 to 17.
Marketing and distribution costs decreased by 3% to EUR3.4m due to the reduction
in the level of marketing activity and related expenditure compared to the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results -5-
previous year.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 31% to EUR10.7m reflecting an additional 7
aircraft on lease during the quarter offset by the savings arising from the
return of 6 737-300's to ILFC.
Route charges increased by 23% to EUR42.6m due to an increase in the number of
sectors flown and an increase of 8% in the average sector length, offset by a
reduction in enroute charges in certain EU countries.
Airport and handling charges increased by 20% to EUR55.5m, which was slower than
the growth in passenger volumes and reflects the impact of increased costs at
certain existing airports offset by lower costs and new airports and bases, and
the strengthening of the Euro exchange rate against Sterling.
Other expenses increased by 17% to EUR21.5m, which is lower than the growth in
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some existing products, and cost
reductions achieved on indirect costs.
Operating margins have declined by 5 points to 37% due to the reasons outlined
above whilst operating profits have increased by 18% to EUR202.2m during the
quarter.
Interest receivable has increased by EUR2.4m to EUR9.2m for the quarter due to the
combined impact of higher levels of cash and cash equivalents and increases in
average deposit rates earned in the quarter compared to last year.
Interest payable increased by EUR5.1m to EUR18.4m due to the drawdown of debt to
part fund the purchase of new aircraft.
Foreign exchange losses have decreased during the quarter to EUR0.5m due to the
positive impact of changes in the Sterling exchange rate against the Euro
compared to last year.
                       Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Accounting Policies
    This period's financial information has been prepared on the basis of the
     recognition and measurement requirements of International Financial
     Reporting Standards ("IFRS") in issue that either are adopted by the EU and
     effective (or available for early adoption) at 31 March 2006 or are expected
     to be adopted and effective (or available for early adoption) at 31 March
     2006, the Group's first annual reporting date at which it is required to use
     accounting standards adopted by the EU. Based on these recognition and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results -5-
     measurement requirements, management has made assumptions about the
     accounting policies expected to be applied, when the first annual financial
     statements are prepared in accordance with accounting standards adopted by
     the EU for the financial year ending 31 March 2006. These preliminary
     accounting policies are set out in the document titled "Explanation of the
     financial impact following adoption of IFRS" published in August 2005 with
     the first quarter financial results.
 2. Approval of the Preliminary Announcement
     The Audit Committee approved the consolidated financial statements for the
     half year ended Sept 30, 2005 on November 4th, 2005.
 3. Generally Accepted Accounting Policies
     The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results for the half year ended
     Sept 30, 2005 and the comparative period are based on the results reported
     under the group's preliminary IFRS accounting policies, as adjusted for
     certain exceptional items.
4. Ancillary Products and Services
        In order to more accurately reflect the structure of certain ancillary
         contracts and to provide more meaningful information to users the Group
         has taken the opportunity to reclassify certain ancillary revenues and
         costs (primarily car hire and travel insurance). This has resulted in a
         reduction in revenues of EUR19.9 million with a corresponding reduction in
         costs in the period ended 30 September 2005 (30 September 2004: EUR10.8
         million). This has resulted in an increase in net margin of 0.5% to
         25.1% in the period ended 30 September 2005 (30 September 2004 0.4% to
         28.3%). Going forward the Group intends to report ancillary revenues and
         costs on a basis consistent with the treatment described herein."
Independent review report to Ryanair Holdings plc for the six months ended 30
September 2005
Introduction
We have been instructed by the company to review the consolidated balance sheet
of Ryanair Holdings plc at 30 September 2005 and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in shareholders' funds - equity and cash flows for
the six month period then ended and the related notes as set out on pages 1 to
7. We have read the other information contained in the interim report and
considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial information.
Directors' responsibilities
The interim report, including the financial information contained therein, is
the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors. The directors
are responsible for preparing the interim report in accordance with the Listing
Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange which require that the accounting policies and
presentation applied to the interim figures should be consistent with those
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results -5-
applied in preparing the preceding annual accounts except where there are any
changes, and the reasons for them, are disclosed. As explained in note 3 to the
document published by Ryanair on 2nd August 2005, entitled "Explanation of the
Financial Impact Following the Adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards", EU law requires that the next annual consolidated financial
statements of the company are prepared in accordance with accounting standards
adopted for use in the European Union further to IAS Regulation (EC 1606/2002).
Therefore this interim financial information has been prepared on the basis of
the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS's in issue that either are
adopted by the EU and effective (or available for early adoption) at 31 March
2006 or are expected to be adopted and effective (or available for early
adoption) at 31 March 2006.
Review work performed
We conducted our review in accordance with guidance contained in Bulletin 1999/4
"Review of Interim Financial Information" issued by the Auditing Practices Board
for use in Ireland and the United Kingdom. A review consists principally of
making enquiries of group management and applying analytical procedures to the
financial information and underlying financial data and, based thereon,
assessing whether the accounting policies and presentation have been
consistently applied unless otherwise disclosed. A review excludes audit
procedures such as tests of controls and verification of assets, liabilities and
transactions. It is substantially less in scope than an audit performed in
accordance with Auditing Standards and therefore provides a lower level of
assurance than an audit. Accordingly we do not express an audit opinion on the
financial information.
Emphasis of matter
Without qualifying our review conclusion, we draw attention to note 3 to the
document published by Ryanair on 2nd August 2005, entitled "Explanation of the
Financial Impact Following the Adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards", that explains why there is a possibility that the company's
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results -5-
management may determine that changes to the accounting policies adopted in
preparing the consolidated interim financial information are necessary when
management prepares its first annual financial statements in accordance with
accounting standards adopted by the EU as of 31 March 2006.
Review conclusion
On the basis of our review we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial information as presented for the six months
ended 30 September 2005, which is stated to have been prepared in accordance
with the basis of preparation note set out in note 3 to the "Explanation of the
Financial Impact Following the Adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards". This describes how the recognition and measurement requirements of
accounting standards expected to be adopted by the EU for use at the next annual
reporting date have been applied, including the assumptions management has made
about the standards and interpretations expected to be effective, and the
policies expected to be adopted, when management prepares its first annual
financial statements in accordance with accounting standards adopted by the EU
as of 31 March 2006.

 Ryanair is consumer's No. 1 airline on UK-Ireland Routes
 Ryanair, Europe's only low fares airline today (Tuesday, February 25, 2003)
 announced its market share figures for January 2003, confirming Ryanair's
 NO. 1 position on the UK and Ireland routes. Ryanair is flying 50% of all
 passengers on the UK-Dublin routes, once again proving that low fares beat
 the high-fare carriers anytime and everytime.
 Commenting on the details today, Kathryn Munro, Ryanair's Sales Manager for
 UK and Scotland, Kathryn Munro, said:
 "Once again, Ryanair continues to dominate the most popular route,
 London-Dublin, carrying over 42% of the passengers every day.
 "Ryanair have always been and will always continue to be committed to
 offering our consumers low fares, choice and efficient services competing
 with Aer Lingus, British Airways, and British Midland on these routes.
 "And our latest figures confirm passengers like the deal they're getting
 from major UK destinations to Dublin. Passengers are flocking into Dublin
 with Ryanair from London, Bristol, Leeds, Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh.
 "We're NO 1 on these routes, carrying over 60% of the passengers on the
 Glasgow-Dublin, Edinburgh-Dublin routes, a whopping 97% on the
 Leeds-Bradford - Dublin route and 94% on the Newcastle -Dublin routes".

 of the five (5) business days immediately preceding
 the day of the purchase of the Ordinary Shares;
 and
(iv)          for the purpose of sub-paragraph (iii)(B), "Relevant Price" means, in respect of the

Body
 The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided to the 
CEO, who is the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource allocation decisions the 
CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data. However, resource allocation decisions are made based on the 
entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in type.  The objective in 
making resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial results, rather than individual routes 
within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the adjusted profit/(loss) after tax of the Group for 
the period.  All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Group has a single 
reportable segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Group's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed across the 
Group's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment operations.  In addition, as the 
Group is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and liabilities have been allocated to the Group's 
single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

 Acquisitions and disposals
 Capital expenditure in the half-year to September 30, 2017 amounted to EUR675.0M and primarily relates to 
aircraft pre delivery payments and 20 aircraft deliveries.
 11.          Financial instruments and financial risk management
 The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 These preliminary financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2017 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the period.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --           Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
that the Group can access at the measurement date.
 --           Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
that asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --           Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 Fair value estimation
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --           Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to determine 
the fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
 --           Derivatives - currency forwards and aircraft fuel contracts: A comparison of the contracted 
rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at March 31, 2017 has been used to 
establish fair value. (Level 2)
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the half-year to September 30, 2017, 
there were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 Financial instruments disclosed at fair value
 --           Fixed-rate long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been 
discounted at the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at September 30, 
2017 to arrive at a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -7-
 There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the half-year to 
September 30, 2017 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.
 11.          Financial instruments and financial risk management (continued)
 The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial balance sheet, are as follows:

 Ryanair Holdings PLC
 25 November 2010
 AVIATION ALLIANCE CALLS FOR OVERHAUL OF EXPORT CREDIT RULES.
 EXTENSION OF EXPORT CREDITS FOR ALL US AND EUROPEAN CARRIERS
 MAINTAIN EXISTING EXPORT CREDIT FEES TO SUSTAIN GROWTH AND JOBS.
 The Aviation Alliance ("The Alliance"), a group of 10 airlines operating 833 aircraft, carrying 173 million passengers 
p.a. and with aircraft orders worth US$129 billion, today (25 Nov) called for an overhaul of Export Credit rules for 
aviation.
 The Alliance, consisting of Cargolux, Emirates, Etihad, Korean Air, Norwegian, Oman Air, Pegasus, Ryanair, Virgin 
Blue and Wizz Air, is seeking the removal of the "Home Country" rule that prevents US carriers and carriers in 
certain European countries that manufacture aircraft from accessing Export Credit support.
 Removing this rule would enable export credits to be extended to all US and European carriers.
 The Alliance also favours the upgrading of existing credit risk rating structures used by European and US export 
credit agencies and the retention of the existing structures and exposure fees governing the granting of export 
credits to airlines, to ensure there would be:
 -- no limit set on the amount of export credits extended to any airline;
 -- no increase in the current up front exposure fees as a proportion of the value of the credit extended; and
 -- no reduction in the proportion of the cost of an aircraft that can be financed.
 Alliance spokesman Howard Millar said:
 "Our aim is to highlight the importance of export credits in delivering export growth, and supporting hundreds of 
thousands of jobs in the Aerospace industry in the US and Europe."
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aviation Alliance Calls Overhaul of Export Credit
 "Export credit financing is essential to the continued growth of the aviation industry. We have come together today 
to call for the extension of export credits to all airlines in the US and Europe, irrespective of whether they are based 
in a country which manufactures aircraft.
 "We are calling for the 'Home Country' rule to be removed, export credit structures to be enhanced, the maintaining 
of existing exposure fees and structures governing the proportion of an aircraft that can be financed using export 
credits.
 "By doing this we can protect hundreds of thousands of jobs in the aircraft manufacturing and airline industries, 
ensure a level playing field for all airlines, deliver increased competition and choice for passengers, and support 
worldwide economic growth."
 The Alliance is issuing a letter with its proposals to all interested parties involved in the present OECD negotiations, 
including Secretary Geithner in the US, George Osborne - the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the UK, Christine 
Lagarde - the Minister of Finance in France, Wolfgang Schauble - the Finance Minister of Germany, Elena Salgado 
Mendez - the Minister of Finance in Spain and the Chief Executives of Boeing, Airbus, and the Export Credit 
Agencies.
 The key points of the Alliance's proposal include:
 1. An enhancement of the export credit risk rating structures adopted by the existing US and European export 
credit agencies in 2008.
 2. The removal of the "Home Country" rule in order to enable all US and European carriers who do not currently 
have access to export credit to gain access.
 3. Maintaining the existing credit rules so there would be no limit on the amount of export credits extended to any 
airline, no increase in the current exposure fees, retention of the Cape Town discount, and no reduction in the 
proportion of the cost of an aircraft that can be financed

 In June 2013 the Company bought back 24.1m ordinary shares at a total cost of EUR176.6m.  This is 
equivalent to approximately 1.7% of the Company's issued share capital.  All ordinary shares repurchased 
have been cancelled. Accordingly, share capital decreased by 24.1m ordinary shares with a nominal value of 
EUR0.2m and the capital redemption reserve increased by a corresponding EUR0.2m.  The capital redemption 
reserve is required to be created under Irish law to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
 On June 20, 2013 the Company detailed plans to return up to EUR1 billion to shareholders over the next 
two years (subject to shareholder approval) with at least EUR400 million in share buybacks to be completed 
in the fiscal year to March 31, 2014 and up to a further EUR600 million in either special dividends or 
share buybacks in the fiscal year to March 31, 2015.
 13.     Related party transactions
 We have related party relationships with our subsidiaries, directors and senior key management personnel. 
All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
 There were no related party transactions in the quarter ended June 30, 2013 that materially affected the 
financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no changes in the 
related party transactions described in the 2012 Annual Report that could have a material effect on the 
financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.

Irish Takeover Panel
09 November 2006
                        Irish Takeover Panel Announcement
    Offer by Ryanair Holdings plc ("Ryanair") for Aer Lingus Group plc
                                   ("Aer Lingus")
The Panel has considered whether a statement made by Ryanair in an announcement
released on 20 October, 2006 complied with Rule 19.1 (standards of care) of the
Irish Takeover Panel Takeover Rules. The statement in question is:
".... Aer Lingus employees will realise over EUR220m from the sale of their Aer
Lingus Shares. This represents an average of over EUR60,000 for each employee".
Rule 19.1 requires inter alia that every document or statement issued in
connection with an offer by the offeror or the offeree meets the same standards
of accuracy, completeness and fair presentation as would be required of a
prospectus. Furthermore, the Rule requires that every document and statement
shall clearly state the source for any fact which is material to any argument
contained in it, including sufficient detail to enable the significance of the
Irish Takeover Panel Panel Announcement
fact to be assessed.
While some of the assumptions underpinning the figures in the statement are set
out in the announcement, the Panel decided that sufficient detail on the
assumptions underpinning the figures in the statement was not disclosed.
Consequently, Aer Lingus shareholders were provided with insufficient detail to
enable them to assess the significance of this statement. As such, the statement
did not satisfy the standards of completeness required under Rule 19.1(a) and
(b). Consequently, the Panel ruled that the statement breached Rule 19.1(a) and
(b).
The Panel notes that the announcement also refers to:
".... ESOT Members realising over EUR186 million for their Aer Lingus Shares,
which equates to an estimated average of EUR60,000 per ESOT Member".
In this regard, it should be noted that an announcement made by Aer Lingus ESOP
Trustee Limited on 26 October stated that based on the offer price, the average
proceeds before tax but after repayment of borrowing costs which would be
realised for each member by the ESOT if the Ryanair offer is accepted would be:
Employee members:    EUR38,864 on average per member
 Ex-employee members: EUR13,915 on average per member.

Since certain of the Ordinary Shares are held by brokers or other nominees, the number of direct record holders in 
the United States, which is reported above 68, may not be fully indicative of the number of direct beneficial owners 
in the United States, or of where the direct beneficial owners of such shares are resident.
 In order to increase the percentage of its share capital held by EU nationals, beginning June 26, 2001, Ryanair 
Holdings instructed the Depositary to suspend the issuance of new ADRs in exchange for the deposit of Ordinary 
Shares until further notice. Therefore, holders of Ordinary Shares cannot currently convert their Ordinary Shares 
into ADRs. The Depositary will however convert existing ADRs into Ordinary Shares at the request of the holders of 
such ADRs. The Company in 2002 implemented additional measures to restrict the ability of non-EU nationals to 
purchase Ordinary Shares. As a result, non-EU nationals are currently effectively barred from purchasing Ordinary 
Shares. See "Item 10. Additional Information-Limitations on Share Ownership by Non-EU Nationals" for additional 
information.

All Ordinary Shares repurchased have been cancelled.
 The maximum price at which the Company may repurchase Ordinary Shares, in accordance with the listing rules of 
the Irish Stock Exchange and of the Financial Services Authority, is the higher of 5% above the average market 
value of the Company's Ordinary Shares for the five business days prior to the day of the repurchase and the price 
stipulated by Article 5(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) of 22 December 2003 (No. 2273/2003) (which is the 
higher of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the Irish Stock Exchange). The 
minimum price at which the Company may repurchase Ordinary Shares is their nominal value, currently 0.635 euro 
cent per share.
 At an extraordinary general meeting of Shareholders held on April 19, 2012 the Company obtained a new 
repurchase authority which will enable the Company to repurchase the Company's ADRs which are traded on 
NASDAQ. The maximum price at which Ordinary Shares which underlie the Company's ADRs can be repurchased 
is 5% above the average market value of one-fifth of the Company's ADRs as quoted on NASDAQ, for the five 
business days prior to the date of purchase (as one ADS represents five Ordinary Shares). Any ADRs purchased 
will be converted to Ordinary Shares by the Company's brokers for subsequent repurchase and cancellation by the 
Company.
 As of June 30, 2012, the total number of options over Ordinary Shares outstanding under all of the Company's 
share option plans was 17,912,382, representing 1.2% of the Company's issued share capital at that date.

         RYANAIR APPLIES FOR INJUNCTION AGAINST LATEST UNLAWFUL ATTEMPT
                   BY ENAC TO BLOCK LOW FARES AND COMPETITION
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (8th August) announced that
it has applied to the regional administrative court in Lazio for an immediate
injunction to overturn the recent unlawful attempt by ENAC (the Italian Civil
Aviation Authority) to restrict capacity at Rome Ciampino Airport by almost 30%
from November 2007. In so doing the Italian Authorities are again trying to
support the terminally ill Alitalia by blocking low fares and competition in
Rome. Ryanair has also submitted a complaint to the European Commission asking
it to immediately intervene on behalf of consumers to prohibit this unlawful
reduction of capacity at Rome's secondary airport.
For the past year ENAC has been trying by various unlawful means to restrict the
low fares and choice offered by airlines at Rome Ciampino as follows:
Ryanair Holdings PLC INJUNCTION AGAINST ENAC
   False claims about a night time noise issue at the airport, despite the
     fact Ryanair, which uses the quietest and youngest aircraft in Ciampino,
     does not operate any night time flights at Ciampino. All of Ryanair's
     repeated requests for a detailed noise study at Rome Ciampino Airport to
     expose the truth of this matter have been ignored. Such a study would have
     proved conclusively that noise problems at Rome Ciampino are being caused by
     military aircraft operating at night and have nothing to do with the
     commercial movements of airlines like Ryanair or Easyjet.
    In May last year ENAC imposed an unlawful PSO monopoly between Rome and
     Alghero forcing Ryanair to stop offering low fares and choice on this route.
     Again, there were no grounds for this blatant attempt to protect Alitalia
     and the European Commission has now instructed the Italian Government to
     reverse this unlawful decision.
    Now ENAC has issued an order that capacity at Rome Ciampino airport is to
     be reduced by 30% to just 100 movements per day from November. They have
     also ordered that the airport must close for at least 5 months for
     unsubstantiated 'essential' runway works and that commercial flights should
     not return to Ciampino upon completion. There is no evidence that there is
     any problem with the runway in Ciampino. Airlines were not consulted about
     ENAC's claimed need to undertake these runway works. Furthermore ENAC have
     made no attempt to explain why commercial flights should be not be allowed
     to return to Ciampino upon completion of these works.
Speaking today in Rome, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said:
"This latest unlawful attempt by the Italian Authorities to restrict capacity
and block low fares at Rome Ciampino airport is bad for Italian consumers/
visitors. If Ryanair and the other low fare airlines using Rome Ciampino are
removed unlawfully by ENAC, Italian consumers/visitors will be forced to pay
Alitalia's rapaciously high fares and fuel surcharges while tourism in Rome will
suffer irreparable damage.
"We have asked the Lazio Court for an injunction to stop this unlawful reduction
in capacity at Ciampino so that Ryanair can continue to operate on its existing
network of routes this summer and to offer new services. Without this injunction
the following routes would have to be terminated: Rome to Madrid; Rome to
Saragoza and flights to Glasgow and Madrid would have to be drastically reduced.
Ryanair would also be prevented from re-launching the Rome to Alghero route - a
route it was forced to terminate due to an unlawful PSO imposed by ENAC. Ryanair
has also called on the European Commission to intervene immediately on behalf of
Italian consumers/visitors who should not be denied flights or forced to pay
higher fares because of these unlawful efforts to provide further illegal state
support to Alitalia".

                          RYANAIR BEATS ITS EXPECTATIONS.
                  Q3 NET PROFIT OF EUR35m - TRAFFIC GROWS 13% TO 6.9M
    Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today (Monday, 31st January 2005)
     announced a Net Profit after tax of EUR35.0m for the 3rd Quarter ended 31 Dec
     2004. Passenger volumes grew by 13% to 6.9m whilst yields were in line with
     the same Quarter last year, and as a result, total revenues rose by 15% to
     EUR294.4m. Unit costs rose by 26% due to the increase in the level of activity
     and in particular higher fuel and route charges. During the Quarter,
     maintenance provisions of EUR4.5m (net of tax) were released to the profit and
     loss due to the earlier than scheduled return of 6 leased 737-300's. As a
     result Q3 net profit declined by 26% and the Q3 profit margin after tax
     declined by 7 points to 12%.

Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results
     goodwill charge of EUR0.6m in 2003 and EUR0.5m in 2004.
    Announcing these results Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, said:
    "These quarterly results are a testimony to the strength of the Ryanair
     "lowest cost" model which - even during the most difficult trading
     conditions (including record fuel prices and intense competition) - delivers
     strong passenger growth and profits. We continue, like Southwest, to
     maintain our record of 31 consecutive quarters of unbroken profitability
     (before exceptionals) since we floated in May 1997.
    "As predicted, casualties continue in the European industry, most notably
     Volare, VBird and Air Polonia. Hapag Lloyd Express, MyTravel Lite and Basiq
     Air have announced significant reversals of capacity back into their charter
     operations, while many of Europe's flag carriers (most notably Alitalia and
     SAS) have announced record losses. This is not a temporary phenomenon
     resulting from high oil prices, but a permanent market shift towards low
     cost air travel, led by Ryanair. Only the lowest cost airlines like
     Southwest in the US and Ryanair in Europe will prosper over the medium term
     and we expect further casualties, cut backs and withdrawals among our loss
     making competitors.
    "Despite intense competition, yields were similar to those achieved last
     year and better than our previous guidance of a decline of between 5% to
     10%. We believe this is due to capacity removals by competitors and the
     continuing impact of multiple fuel surcharges imposed by many of our high
     fare competitors, which have made Ryanair's low fares even more attractive
     to European consumers.
    "Fuel prices remain high and will continue to impact our future guidance.
     Our fuel hedges expired at the end of October 2004 and we were unhedged
     during November, however as forward prices fell, we restarted our hedging
     programme for this Winter season. We are almost 100% hedged at an average of
     $41 per barrel for Brent crude for the 4th Quarter and are unhedged
     thereafter. Lower than expected fuel prices also had a positive impact on
     our Quarter 3 results when fuel costs were EUR4m better than our previous
     guidance. We expect our Q4 fuel costs to be EUR5m lower than the previous
     guidance. We still see value in hedging to remove uncertainty from our
     business and will continue to review our hedging policy as forward oil
     prices return to more "normal" levels.
    "Advance bookings for Q4 indicate that traffic growth is in line with
     expectations. With some 50% of the seats sold (and assuming no adverse
     movement in exchange rates) we expect yields may now rise by up to 5% for
     the Quarter. We would caution investors that this upturn in yield is more a
     reflection of the precipitous 22% decline in the comparable Q4 yields last
     year, slower capacity growth and an earlier Easter, rather than some
     significant current price recovery. As we review Q4 of last year, it appears
     to have been an exceptional result with yields collapsing due to the
     combined effect of the war in Iraq, the threat of terrorism, high oil
     prices, our own enormous capacity growth (+50%) and the market entry of many
     irrational low fare (but not low cost) airlines in Europe, many of whom have
     disappeared as quickly as they entered.
    "Ryanair continues to grow strongly and profitably in spite of adverse
     market conditions. The airline is now carrying 74% more traffic than it did
     just two years ago (in Q3 of 2002). Ryanair is the No.1 or No.2 airline in
     terms of market share in over 90% of our markets and we continue to maintain
     world record profit margins despite significantly higher oil prices and
     route charges. Our new bases in Luton, Liverpool and Shannon are booking
     well for 2005, and we believe that our 21 new Spanish routes will also
     perform strongly, particularly during the Summer months. We have (last week)
     announced six new routes from Dublin to Biarritz and Carcassonne in France,
     Frankfurt in Germany, Eindhoven in Holland, Doncaster in the UK and Rome in
     Italy as a foretaste of what is on offer from Dublin if we get a second
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results
     competing terminal. Once again, we strongly urge the Taoiseach to press
     ahead with the second terminal at Dublin airport. In addition, this morning
     Ryanair will unveil its first 3 Italian domestic routes. The destinations
     and fares will be announced at a press conference in Rome, which will herald
     the end of Alitalia's domestic high fare monopoly in Italy.
    "We support the development of a second runway at Stansted Airport, but are
     united with all other Stansted users in opposing the GBP4bn. folly being
     advocated by the BAA. The fact that price sensitive consumers are being
     asked to cross subsidise almost GBP2bn. worth of unnecessary rail links and
     motorways demonstrates how completely out of touch the BAA airport monopoly
     has become. Ryanair and other Stansted users support the type of low cost,
     second terminal and runway facilities developed by Manchester at a cost of
     some GBP400m. But only a regulated monopoly like the BAA could possibly
     propose spending ten times this sum on gold plating facilities that our
     passengers neither need nor want. We call on the UK Government to break up
     the BAA airport monopoly, which is now the world's most profitable airport
     operator, because passengers need competition between the London airports if
     British consumers and visitors are to continue to enjoy the lowest cost air
     travel in Europe.
    "The initial trial of our inflight entertainment system has been
     disappointing. Whilst the trial period was hampered by the lack of content
     in non-English languages, the uptake among passengers has been lower than
     expected. We have now resolved these service issues with the content
     provider, but unless we see a significant improvement in customer take up,
     we will not roll out the system across the entire fleet as planned. We
     remain believers in the potential of inflight entertainment however, as
     initially with CD's and the IPod, it may take some time for the travelling
     public in Europe to catch on to the technology. Should we decide to
     discontinue with IFE at the end of our extended trial period, Ryanair will
     suffer no financial loss whatsoever.
    "We continue our cautious outlook for Quarter 4 and the full year outturn.
     Whilst yields and fuel prices are now somewhat better than originally
     forecast, Sterling has weakened appreciably and this will have a downward
     impact on yields. In Quarter 4 last year we suffered a 22% collapse in
     average fares, however based on current booking trends we now expect that Q4
     yields this year might be as much as 5% higher than last year. Despite
     higher route and fuel charges, we continue to deliver the highest net
     margins in the industry and we therefore believe that Ryanair's lowest cost
     model will continue to grow and prosper across Europe to the benefit of our
     passengers, people and our shareholders".

                  Management Discussion and Analysis of Results
Introduction
For the purposes of the MD&A all figures and comments are by reference to the
adjusted income statement excluding exceptional items referred to below.
Exceptional items for quarter ended June 30, 2005 consisted of a receipt of
EUR5.2m (net of tax) arising from the settlement of an insurance claim for the
scribing of 6 Boeing 737-200 aircraft.
Profit after tax increased by 31% to EUR69.6m compared to EUR53.1m in the previous
quarter ended June 30, 2004. The adjusted profit for the quarter, excluding
exceptional items, increased by 21% to EUR64.4m.
The results for the quarter and comparative year have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") accounting
policies expected to be adopted in the annual financial statements for the year
ended 31 March 2006, and a detailed explanation of the financial impact of the
adoption of these policies is set out in a separate document issued with these
quarterly financial results for the period to 30 June 2005. A reconciliation
between the Net Income and Shareholders equity under IFRS and Irish/UK GAAP is
attached in Note 2 to this Management Discussion & Analysis.
Summary Quarter ended June 30, 2005
Profit after tax increased by 21% to EUR64.4m, compared to EUR53.1m in the previous
quarter ended June 30, 2004. Total operating revenues increased by 35% to
EUR404.6m, which was faster than the 30% growth in passenger volumes, as average
fares rose by 3% and ancillary revenues grew by 44% to EUR58.4m. Total revenue per
passenger as a result increased by 4% whilst load factors remained at 83%.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -3-
Total operating expenses increased by 38% to EUR324.8m, due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs, primarily fuel, route charges and airport
& handling costs associated with the growth of the airline. Fuel, our largest
cost item, increased by 112% to EUR109.9m due to substantial increases in the US$
cost per gallon, partially offset by the strengthening of the Euro to the US$.
Due to the significantly higher fuel costs, Operating margins declined by 2
points to 20%, which in turn resulted in Operating profit increasing by 23% to
EUR79.9m.
Profit before tax increased by 22%, less than the increase in operating profit
due to the higher net interest charges arising from the increased level of debt,
partially offset by foreign exchange gains which arose from the translation of
foreign currency bank balances to Euro at the quarter end exchange rates. Total
unit costs increased by 6% driven by the 112% increase in fuel costs to EUR109.9m.
Excluding fuel costs, total unit costs fell by 9%.
Net Margins declined by 2 points to 16% for the reasons outlined above and
Adjusted basic earnings per share increased by 21% to 8.47 cent for the Quarter.
Balance Sheet
The Company's increase in profitability continues to generate strong cashflows
from operations, which for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 amounted to EUR213.7m.
This cashflow funded additional aircraft deposits whilst the balance is
reflected in the EUR180.8m increase in Total Cash since March 31, 2005 to
EUR1,786.5m. The Company had no material capital expenditure during the quarter
whilst Long Term Debt, net of repayments, reduced by EUR28.7m. Shareholders' Funds
at June 30, 2005 have reduced by EUR35.5m to EUR1,699.0m, compared to March 31, 2005
reflecting the increase in profitability during the quarter of EUR64.4m offset by
a reduction of EUR114.6m resulting from changes in the accounting treatment for
derivative financial instruments following the adoption of IFRS.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Quarter ended June 30, 2005
Profit after tax increased by 21% to EUR64.4m due to a 3% increase in average

costs increasing by 112% to EUR109.9m reflecting the higher US$ cost per gallon.
Operating margins, as a result, fell by 2 points to 20%, which in turn resulted

RYANAIR ANNOUNCES FULL YEAR NET PROFIT OF EUR105M
 FARES FALL 8% AS TRAFFIC GROWS 15% TO 59M PASSENGERS
 PROFITS EXPECTED TO DOUBLE TO OVER EUR200M IN CURRENT YEAR.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fare airline today (2 June) announced a full year
 Net Profit of EUR105m (ahead of market expectations) despite suffering
 substantially higher oil prices during a year in which fuel costs rose by EUR466m
 (+59%) to EUR1,257m. Revenues rose by 8% to EUR2,942m as air fares fell 8% and
 traffic grew 15% to 58.5m. Ryanair has now grown to be the Europe's largest
 airline having overtaken Air France, BA and Lufthansa's passenger numbers and
 market capitalisation.

Announcing these results Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
"Despite the global recession and record high oil prices Ryanair's lowest
 fare/lowest cost airline services again delivered traffic growth and
 profitability which demonstrates the fundamental strength of the Ryanair model.
 The principal highlights of the past year included:-
- After tax profit of EUR105m.
 - Traffic growth of 15% to 59m.
 - 18 net new aircraft (year end fleet 181 Boeing 737-800 aircraft).
 - 6 new bases at Alghero, Birmingham, Bologna, Bournemouth, Cagliari, and
 Edinburgh.
 - 223 new routes.
 - BAA airport monopoly broken up - Gatwick, Stansted and Edinburgh to be sold.
 - EU's Charleroi state aid decision dismissed by the European courts.
 - Passenger service further improved (No 1 on time major airline).
To deliver a Net Profit of EUR105m (although a disappointing EUR376m decline over
 last year's figure) was a robust performance during a year of record high oil
 prices when our fuel bill jumped by EUR466m (up 59%). In a year when most airline
 competitors announced large losses, Ryanair's profit exceeded our previous
 guidance. Average fares (due to the global recession and weaker Sterling) fell
 by 8% to EUR40, but this was largely funded by a 3% reduction in non fuel
 operating costs. The recession and declining consumer confidence is proving to
 be good for Ryanair's growth, as millions of passengers switch to our lower
 fares. All of our major competitors have reported material reductions in
 short-haul capacity and traffic. Ryanair will continue to lower fares to
 stimulate traffic growth, maintain high load factors and win more shorthaul
 traffic from our high fare competitors.
Ancillary revenues grew by 23% to EUR598m. We have now achieved our target of 20%
 of revenues (18% last year) one year ahead of schedule. Our onboard mobile
 telephony service trial commenced at the end of February and is now available on
 over 40 aircraft based in Ireland and Italy. Early indications prove that
 consumers love this service and penetration rates continue to rise. While
 initial revenues will be small, we believe that in-flight communications will
 make a meaningful contribution to ancillary profit growth in future years if
 this trial proves successful.
Fuel costs rose by EUR466m (59%) to EUR1.257bn and accounted for 45% of our
 operating costs compared to 37% in fiscal '08. We have taken advantage of recent
 falls in jet fuel prices to extend our hedging programme for FY'10 to 90% for
 the first 3 quarters at an average price of approx. $620 per tonne and 5% of Q4
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Full Year Results
 at approx. $490 per tonne. Assuming that we hedge the balance of our fuel
 requirements at current rates this would reduce our fuel bill by approx. EUR450m
 in FY'10. Excluding fuel, other operating costs fell by 3% on a per passenger
 basis.
Competitive Environment
 Most of our competitors are reporting material traffic and yield declines which
 has led to greater losses and an accelerating trend of airline
 closure/consolidations. European air travel is increasingly dominated by 4 major
 airlines comprising 3 high fare airline groups (led by Air France, BA &
 Lufthansa) and one very large low fares airline, Ryanair. Ryanair's continued
 fare cuts and traffic growth has seen us overtake Lufthansa's traffic figures in
 March 09 to finally become Europe's largest airline by both traffic and market
 cap. We are determined to ensure that Europe's consumers and airports will
 always have real competition and a choice over high fare, fuel surcharging
 airlines like Air France, BA, and Lufthansa.

Airport Costs
 Significant reductions in capacity across Europe has led to Ryanair being
 besieged by many large and small airports who are aggressively competing with
 lower costs and more efficient facilities to attract Ryanair to grow in their
 markets. This recession is delivering real cost benefits for Ryanair through the
 combination of a weaker dollar, lower interest rates, lower airport costs, and
 lower unit costs. It is also encouraging passengers to become much more price
 sensitive which is why they are switching to Ryanair's low fares and unbeatable
 customer service over all other competitors.
The break-up of the UK's BAA airport monopoly has finally forced the welcome
 sale of Gatwick and Stansted airports in London, and Edinburgh in Scotland. This
 breakup cannot come a moment too soon for UK consumers and airport users. We
 need real competition between these UK airports to deliver efficient additional
 capacity at much lower cost than the over specified Taj Mahal palaces preferred
 by the high charging BAA monopoly. Regulation of the BAA by the clueless
 economists of the CAA over the past 20 years has utterly failed to protect
 consumers, yet Harry Bush has again approved further unjustified airport price
 increases in Stansted at a time when competitor airports across the UK and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Full Year Results
 Europe are lowering prices. The sooner this inept and hopelessly out of touch
 regulator is booted out the better.
Travel Taxes
 In Ireland our tourism industry is collapsing with 600,000 fewer passengers
 using the DAA's high cost Dublin airport in the first quarter of 2009 alone.
 This tourism collapse will accelerate following the 30 March introduction of the
 government's suicidal EUR10 tourist tax. Ireland is now facing a loss of over 3m
 passengers at its airports in 2009.
We again call on the Irish government to remove this self defeating tourist tax,
 reduce the DAA's monopoly charges, make Ireland a more competitive tourist
 destination again, and reverse this year's collapse in visitor numbers. The
 Belgian and the Dutch governments have already realised that tourism cannot be
 stimulated by taxing tourists and have sensibly decided to scrap their tourist
 taxes.
The Greek and Spanish governments are also reducing airport charges, in some
 cases to zero, and we believe that the Irish government should follow their
 example and scrap this tourist tax before even further damage is done to Irish
 tourism.
Regulatory Developments
 In Ireland we continue to suffer under an incompetent aviation regulator who has
 now been criticised by the Irish government's own appeals panel for 'passive
 regulation'. We again call on this useless and clueless regulator to resign and
 let competing terminals at Dublin airport lead to lower costs where Mr Guiomard
 has hopelessly failed.
We achieved a landmark victory in December when the ECFI dismissed the EU
 Commissions 2004 Charleroi state aid decision. This is not just a success for
 Ryanair but also for European consumers, and regional airports who can now work
 actively with Ryanair to increase their traffic and business using the EU's
 approved Market Economy Investor Principal (MEIP) to enable them to lower costs
 and grow profitability. We also welcome the recent EU Commissions decision on
 the illegal state aid (in the form of discounted domestic airport charges)
 received by Air France at French regional airports and we hope that these
 monies, which amount to over EUR1bn, will be repaid in due course by Air France.
Aer Lingus
 As we advised at the time we withdrew our EUR1.40 per share offer in January, we
 believe that Aer Lingus faces a bleak future as a loss making, subscale,

 The consolidated and Company financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU, to 
present fairly the financial position of the Group and the Company and the performance of the Group.  The 
Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012 provide in relation to such financial statements that references in the 
relevant part of these Acts to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their 
achieving a fair presentation.
 In preparing each of the consolidated and Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
 --      select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 --      make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 --      state that the financial statements comply with IFRSs as adopted by the EU as applied in 
accordance with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012 and IFRSs as issued by the IASB; and
 --      prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Group and the Company will continue in business.
 Under applicable law and the requirements of the Listing Rules issued by the Irish Stock Exchange, the 
directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors' Report and reports relating to directors' 
remuneration and corporate governance that comply with that law and those Rules. In particular, in 
accordance with the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 (the Transparency Regulations), 
the directors are required to include in their report a fair review of the business and a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group and Company and a responsibility statement relating 
to those and other matters, included below.
 The directors are responsible for keeping proper books of account that disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012 and, as regards the consolidated financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  They are also responsible for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities.
 The directors are responsible for the maintenance of integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company's website. Legislation in the Republic of Ireland governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
 Responsibility Statement, in accordance with the Transparency Regulations
 Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on page 102 of the Annual Report confirm 
that, to the best of their knowledge and belief:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -10-
 --      the consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group at March 31, 2013 
and of its profit for the year then ended;
 --      the Company financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, as 
applied in accordance with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities and financial position of the Company at March 31, 2013, and
 --      the Directors' Report contained in the Annual Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Group and Company, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
 Also, as explained in Note 1 on page 150 of the consolidated financial statements, the Group, in addition 
to complying with its legal obligation to comply with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, has also prepared its 
consolidated financial statements in compliance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.  The directors confirm 
that to the best of their knowledge and belief these consolidated financial statements give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group at March 31, 2013 and of its 
profit for the year then ended.

 Independent Auditor's Report to the members of Ryanair Holdings plc
 We have audited the consolidated and Company financial statements ("financial statements") of Ryanair 
Holdings plc for the year ended March 31, 2013, which comprise the consolidated and Company balance 
sheets, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated and Company statements of changes in shareholders' equity, the consolidated and Company 
statements of cash flows and the related notes.  The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation is Irish law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union (EU), and, as regards the parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012.
 This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Section 193 of the 
Companies Act, 1990 and in respect of the separate opinion in relation to International Financial 
Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), on terms that have 
been agreed.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and in respect of the separate opinion in 
relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB, those matters that we have agreed to state to them in our report, 
and for no other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
 Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
 As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities on pages 28 and 29 the directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements giving a true and fair view.  Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with Irish law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).  Those standards require us to comply with the 
Ethical Standards for Auditors issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
 Scope of the audit of the financial statements
 An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error.  This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the company circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of 
the financial statements.  In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements.  If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our 
report.
 Opinion on financial statements
 In our opinion:
 --      the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU, of the state of the Group's affairs as at 31 March 2013 and of its profit for the year 
then ended;
 --      the Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012, of the state 
of the Company's affairs as at 31 March 2013; and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -10-
 --      the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Acts, 1963 
to 2012 and as regards the consolidated financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
 Independent Auditor's Report to the members of Ryanair Holdings plc (continued)
 Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
 As explained in Note 1 on page 150 of the consolidated financial statements, the Group, in addition to 
complying with its legal obligation to comply with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, has also prepared its 
consolidated financial statements in compliance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs 
as issued by the IASB, of the state of the Group's affairs as at March 31, 2013 and of its profit for the 
year then ended.
 Matters on which we are required to report by the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012
 We have obtained all the information and explanations which we consider necessary for the purposes of our 
audit.
 The Company balance sheet is in agreement with the books of account and, in our opinion, proper books of 
account have been kept by the Company.
 In our opinion the information given in the Directors' Report is consistent with the financial statements 
and the description in the Corporate Governance Statement of the main features of the internal control and 
risk management systems in relation to the process for preparing the consolidated financial statements is 
consistent with the consolidated financial statements.
 The net assets of the Company, as stated in the Company balance sheet are more than half of the amount of 
its called-up share capital and, in our opinion, on that basis there did not exist at 31 March 2013 a 
financial situation which under Section 40(1) of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983 would require the 
convening of an extraordinary general meeting of the company.
 Matters on which we are required to report by exception
 We have nothing to report in respect of the following:

 Detailed Discussion and Analysis Quarter Ended September 30, 2005
 Profit after tax, increased by 16% to EUR172.5m due to a 3% increase in average fares and strong 
ancillary revenue growth, which was offset by fuel costs which increased by 105% to EUR127.0m reflecting 
the higher US$ cost per gallon.  Operating margins, as a result, fell by 5 points to 37%, which in turn 
resulted in operating profit increasing by 18% to EUR202.2m compared to the previous quarter.
 Total operating revenues increased by 32% to EUR541.5m whilst passenger volumes increased by 28% to 9.5m.  
Total revenue per passenger increased by 3% in the quarter due to a combination of higher average fares, 
strong ancillary revenue growth but was partially offset by the weakening of Sterling exchange rate 
against the Euro.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 31% to EUR470.5m due to a combination of increased passenger 
volumes on existing routes, the successful launch of new bases at Luton, Liverpool and Shannon and a 3% 
increase in average fares, partially offset by the weakening of Sterling exchange rate against the Euro.
 Ancillary revenues increased 36% to EUR71.0m, a faster growth rate than passenger volumes, reflecting a 
strong performance in non-flight scheduled revenues, on-board sales and other ancillary products. 
Ancillary revenues continue to grow at a faster rate than passenger volumes and remain at 13% of total 
revenues compared to the same period last year.
 Total operating expenses increased by 41% to EUR339.3m due to the increased level of activity, and the 
increased costs primarily fuel, aircraft rentals, route charges and airport and handling costs associated 
with the growth of the airline. Total operating costs were also adversely impacted by an increase in the 
average sector length, whilst higher US$ fuel prices were partially offset by the strength of the Euro 
exchange rate against the US$.
 Staff costs have increased by 18% to EUR41.5m primarily due to a 14% increase in average employee numbers 
to 2,876 and the impact of pay increases of 3% compared to the previous quarter ended September 30, 2004.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 22% to EUR26.1m. A higher depreciation charge due to an 
increase in the size of the 'owned' fleet from 66 to 74, offset by a lower amortisation charge due to the 
retirement of 737-200 aircraft and the positive impact of a new engine maintenance deal on the cost of 
amortisation of 737-800 aircraft. The strengthening of the Euro to US$ also had a positive impact on the 
depreciation and amortisation charge relating to new aircraft deliveries.
 Fuel costs rose by 105% to EUR127.0m due to an increase in the number of sectors flown, an 8% increase in 
sector length, and a significantly higher average US$ cost per gallon of fuel partially offset by the 
positive impact of the strengthening of the Euro to the US$ during the period.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results -6-
 Maintenance costs increased by 4% to EUR11.2m reflecting the improved reliability arising from the higher 
proportion of 737-800 operated and a lower level of maintenance costs incurred due to the return of six 
737-300's and the positive impact of the strengthening of the Euro exchange rate, partially offset by an 
increase in the number of leased 737-800 aircraft from 10 to 17.
 Marketing and distribution costsdecreased by 3% to EUR3.4m due to the reduction in the level of marketing 
activity and related expenditure compared to the previous year.
 Aircraft rental costs increased by 31% to EUR10.7m reflecting an additional 7 aircraft on lease during 
the quarter offset by the savings arising from the return of 6 737-300's to ILFC.
 Route charges increased by 23% to EUR42.6m due to an increase in the number of sectors flown and an 
increase of 8% in the average sector length, offset by a reduction in enroute charges in certain EU 
countries.
 Airport and handling charges increased by 20% to EUR55.5m, which was slower than the growth in passenger 
volumes and reflects the impact of increased costs at certain existing airports offset by lower costs and 
new airports and bases, and the strengthening of the Euro exchange rate against Sterling.
 Other expenses increased by 17% to EUR21.5m, which is lower than the growth in ancillary revenues due to 
improved margins on some existing products, and cost reductions achieved on indirect costs.
 Operating margins have declined by 5 points to 37% due to the reasons outlined above whilst operating 
profits have increased by 18% to EUR202.2m during the quarter.
 Interest receivable has increased by EUR2.4m to EUR9.2m for the quarter due to the combined impact of 
higher levels of cash and cash equivalents and increases in average deposit rates earned in the quarter 
compared to last year.
 Interest payable increased by EUR5.1m to EUR18.4m due to the drawdown of debt to part fund the purchase 
of new aircraft.
 Foreign exchange losses have decreased during the quarter to EUR0.5m due to the positive impact of 
changes in the Sterling exchange rate against the Euro compared to last year.
 Notes to the Financial Statements
 1.  Accounting Policies
 This period's financial information has been prepared on the basis of the recognition and measurement 
requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") in issue that either are adopted by 
the EU and effective (or available for early adoption) at 31 March 2006 or are expected to be adopted and 
effective (or available for early adoption) at 31 March 2006, the Group's first annual reporting date at 
which it is required to use accounting standards adopted by the EU.  Based on these recognition and 
measurement requirements, management has made assumptions about the accounting policies expected to be 
applied, when the first annual financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting standards 
adopted by the EU for the financial year ending 31 March 2006.   These preliminary accounting policies are 
set out in the document titled "Explanation of the financial impact following adoption of IFRS" published 
in August 2005 with the first quarter financial results.
 2.  Approval of the Preliminary Announcement
 The Audit Committee approved the consolidated financial statements for the half year ended Sept 30, 2005 
on November 4th, 2005.
 3.  Generally Accepted Accounting Policies
 The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results for the half year ended Sept 30, 2005  and the 
comparative period are based on the results reported under the group's preliminary IFRS accounting 
policies, as adjusted certain for exceptional items.
 4.       Ancillary Products and Services
 In order to more accurately reflect the structure of certain ancillary contracts and to provide more 
meaningful information to users the Group has taken the opportunity to reclassify certain ancillary 
revenues and costs (primarily car hire and travel insurance). This has resulted in a reduction in revenues 
of EUR19.9 million with a corresponding reduction in costs in the period ended 30 September 2005 (30 
September 2004: EUR10.8 million). This has resulted in an increase in net margin of 0.5% to 25.1% in the 
period ended 30 September 2005 (30 September 2004 0.4% to 28.3%). Going forward the Group intends to 
report ancillary revenues and costs on a basis consistent with the treatment described herein."
 Independent review report to Ryanair Holdings plc for the six months ended 30 September 2005
 Introduction
 We have been instructed by the company to review the consolidated balance sheet of Ryanair Holdings plc 
at 30 September 2005 and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' funds - 
equity and cash flows for the six month period then ended and the related notes as set out on pages 1 to 
7.  We have read the other information contained in the interim report and considered whether it contains 
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial information.
 Directors' responsibilities
 The interim report, including the financial information contained therein, is the responsibility of, and 
has been approved by, the directors.  The directors are responsible for preparing the interim report in 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results -6-
accordance with the Listing Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange which require that the accounting policies 
and presentation applied to the interim figures should be consistent with those applied in preparing the 
preceding annual accounts except where there are any changes, and the reasons for them, are disclosed.  As 
explained in note 3 to the document published by Ryanair on 2nd August 2005, entitled "Explanation of the 
Financial Impact Following the Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards", EU law requires 
that the next annual consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in accordance with 
accounting standards adopted for use in the European Union further to IAS Regulation (EC 1606/2002).  
Therefore this interim financial information has been prepared on the basis of the recognition and 
measurement requirements of IFRS's in issue that either are adopted by the EU and effective (or available 
for early adoption) at 31 March 2006 or are expected to be adopted and effective (or available for early 
adoption) at 31 March 2006.

 Ryanair, like many other long suffering Aer Lingus shareholders is shocked by the continuing erosion of 
shareholder value under the current Board and Management of Aer Lingus. Over the past six years Aer Lingus has 
presided over a share price which has collapsed by more than 80% from over EUR3.20 in early 2007 to under 
EUR0.60 in recent weeks. More than EUR1.3bn of shareholder value has been squandered as a result of this 
catastrophic mismanagement. Over this period cumulative losses have exceeded EUR150m, while exceptional 
charges of almost EUR400m have been charged to the P&L account as follows:
Year          Losses         Exceptionals
 ------  -------------------  -------------
 2006    Loss     (EUR70m)    (- EUR133m)
 ------  -------  ----------  -------------
 2007    Profit    EUR105m      + EUR4m
 ------  -------  ----------  -------------
 2008    Loss     (EUR108m)   (- EUR141m)
 ------  -------  ----------  -------------
 2009    Loss     (EUR130m)    (- EUR89m)
 ------  -------  ----------  -------------
 2010    Profit    EUR49m      (- EUR31m)
 ------  -------  ----------  -------------
 Total   Loss     (EUR154m)   (- EUR390m)
 ------  -------  ----------  -------------
In addition since Aer Lingus' 2006 IPO, you have announced two restructuring programs, PCI 2007 and Greenfield 
2009 (neither of which have delivered a competitive cost base or restored profitability to its pre IPO levels), you 
have ordered over EUR2.4bn of long-haul aircraft at the top of the cycle only to defer all these deliveries within 12 
months of approving this ill-timed order and you have failed to take any action to prevent the share price collapsing 
from over EUR3.20 in 2007 to under EUR0.60 in recent weeks.
 Ryanair and other shareholders cannot continue to be ignored by your Board and Management, while you destroy 
shareholder value, ignore reasonable investor requests for a dividend from your surplus cash, repeatedly make 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Open Letter to Aer -2-
(unauthorised) payments of shareholder funds for staff related payouts and then suppress the independent Deloitte 
and McCann Fitzgerald report into the EUR30m "leave & rehire" debacle.
 We request an urgent, honest and transparent response on these three issues, (a) the release of the suppressed 
Deloitte and McCann Fitzgerald report, (b) an assurance that no further payments (over and above the existing 
defined contribution rates) will be made to the Aer Lingus pension scheme without prior shareholder approval and 
(c) that a special dividend of at least EUR100m will be discussed with, and if approved, paid to shareholders in 
2011 out of your current cash balances of over EUR900m.
 Since we believe that these issues are of vital importance to all Aer Lingus shareholders, and since we believe that 
all shareholders should be invited to consider these concerns in an open transparent and democratic manner, we 
are submitting this letter in an open format and would respectfully request that you reply by open letter so that all 
Aer Lingus shareholders can be fully informed on these important matters which will we believe - if accepted - 
significantly improve shareholder value.
 We would appreciate your response to these issues within 7 days of today's date.
 Yours sincerely
 Michael O'Leary
 Chief Executive
 c.c. All Aer Lingus Shareholders

 Aer Lingus Group PLC
 20 June 2012
 Aer Lingus Group plc
 ISE: EIL1       LSE: AERL
 STATEMENT REGARDING RYANAIR OFFER
 Dublin & London 20 June 2012: The Board of Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus") has considered the 
announcement by Ryanair Holdings plc ("Ryanair") of its intention to make a third unsolicited offer for 
100 per cent. of the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Aer Lingus (the "Offer").
 In evaluating any offer, the Board must consider the uncertainties and risks relating to it.  The UK 
Competition Commission ("CC") is currently investigating Ryanair's 29.82 per cent. holding in Aer Lingus 
with the result that Ryanair is now under a legal prohibition from undertaking any further integration 
with Aer Lingus without the consent of the CC; and may be subject to an order to sell down its shares at 
the end of the CC investigation.  Furthermore the Board notes that Ryanair's unsolicited offer in 2006 was 
blocked by the European Commission and was not capable of completion and that Ryanair's second offer, in 
2008, was withdrawn. Consequently there is significant uncertainty that any offer from Ryanair, if made, 
would be capable of completion.
 The Aer Lingus management team has delivered a significantly improved operational and financial 
performance since 2009, transforming Aer Lingus into a robust, profitable airline which is well positioned 
to serve the key role of "Connecting Ireland to the World". Management's successful strategy of focusing 
on demand-led network management and the introduction of extensive cost saving initiatives has delivered 
sustained and improved profitability, resulting in a turnaround in operating performance of approximately 
EUR130 million since 2009. Aer Lingus has a proven business model and a strong balance sheet including 
cash of in excess of EUR1 billion at 31 March 2012, leaving it well positioned for the future.
 The Board, having considered the Offer with its advisers, believes the Offer, even if it is capable of 
completion, undervalues Aer Lingus.
 Aer Lingus shareholders are accordingly advised to take no action in relation to the Offer.

 Dealing Disclosure Requirements
 Under the provisions of Rule 8.3 of the Irish Takeover Panel Act, 1997, Takeover Rules 2007, as amended (the 
"Irish Takeover Rules"), if any person is, or becomes, 'interested' (directly or indirectly) in, 1 percent, or more of any 
class of 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus or Ryanair, all 'dealings' in any 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus or 
Ryanair (including by means of an option in respect of, or a derivative referenced to, any such 'relevant securities') 
must be publicly disclosed by not later than 3:30 pm (Dublin time) on the business day following the date of the 
relevant transaction. This requirement will continue until the date on which the Offer becomes effective or on which 
the 'Offer period' otherwise ends. If two or more persons co-operate on the basis of any agreement, either express 
or tacit, either oral or written, to acquire an 'interest' in 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus or Ryanair, they will be 
deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3 of the Irish Takeover Rules.
 Under the provisions of Rule 8.1 of the Irish Takeover Rules, all 'dealings' in 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus by 
Ryanair or 'relevant securities' of Ryanair by Aer Lingus, or by any of their respective 'associates' must also be 
disclosed by no later than 12 noon (Dublin time) on the business day following the date of the relevant transaction.
 A disclosure table, giving details of the companies in whose 'relevant securities' 'dealings' should be disclosed can 
be found on the Panel's website at www.irishtakeoverpanel.ie.
 'Interests in securities' arise, in summary, when a person has long economic exposure, whether conditional or 
absolute, to changes in the price of securities. In particular, a person will be treated as having an 'interest' by virtue 
of the ownership or control of securities, or by virtue of any option in respect of, or derivative referenced to, 
securities.
 Terms in quotation marks are defined in the Irish Takeover Rules, which can also be found on the Irish Takeover 
Panel's website. If you are in any doubt as to whether or not you are required to disclose a dealing under Rule 8,

 Ryanair Holdings PLC 
 03 February 2004 
  RYANAIR WELCOMES THE PUBLICATION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S DECISION ON THE 
                           BRUSSELS CHARLEROI COST BASE 
 Ryanair today (3rd February'04) welcomed the publication of the decision of the 
 European Commission as it now means that the industry can at least focus on the 
 issues instead of rumours and leaks from the Commission. 
    This decision confirms that the European Commission intends to increase 
     costs and air fares for consumers. 
    The result of this decision is that the European Commission will prevent 
     publicly owned airports competing with privately owned airports. 
    The decision is an attack on all low fare airlines and publicly owned 
     airports and will equally affect Easyjet at Berlin Schonefeld, Toulouse and 
     Marseille, Lufthansa at Leipzig and Munich, Flybe at Perpignan, Bergerac and 
     La Rochelle for example. 
    It is regrettable that the Commission is placing the complains of high 
     cost airports ad high fares airlines above the interests of ordinary 
     consumers who want lower fares. 
    The Commission has now confirmed that publicly owned airports can no 
     longer compete with privately owned airports, and this decision is 
     anticompetitive, anti consumer, will increase costs which will in turn 
     increase air fares. 
 Michael O'Leary, Chief Executive Officer of Ryanair said today in Brussels: 
 "It is impossible to envisage the Commission limiting the discounts or marketing 
 support that Tesco, Carrefour, Aldi or Lidl negotiate in order to lower prices 
 for consumers. It is impossible to envisage the Commission preventing McDonalds 
 negotiating discounts from its suppliers in order to lower the cost of its meals 
 to consumers. 
 "This decision will be appealed to the European Court. We believe the appeal 
 will be supported by many other low fares airlines, regional airports and 
 consumer groups. The European Commission should not be interfering in the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Welcoming of EU Decision
 operation of a free market. Charleroi airport was empty 5 years ago. If this 
 ruling applied back then it would still be an empty airport today. Underused 
 secondary and regional airports must discount to attract low fares customers. 
 Both Brussels Charleroi and Ryanair are profitable at these discounted rates, 
 and 2.5 million consumers annually now fly to /from Brussels Charleroi at the 
 lowest fares in Europe thanks to these discounted routes. 
 "The only beneficiaries of this decision is the original Complainant, Brussels 
 Zaventem Airport and the high fare carriers who fly there. They will now face 
 reduced competition, and higher fares at Brussels Charleroi, thanks to the 
 failure of the EU Commission to promote competition, lower fares and consumer 
 interests."

                RYANAIR'S PUNCTUALITY BEATS THE BEST OF THE U.S.
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (1st March 04) celebrated
beating the best of the U.S. airlines for punctuality in 2003. Not only is
Ryanair the on-time performance leader of all the major European Airlines month
on month, but also, according to the latest punctuality statistics issued by the
US Department of Transport, Ryanair has the best on-time performance compared to
all the other US airlines for 2003!
Ryanair's Head of Communication, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
"When it comes to punctuality, Ryanair leaves the best of the U.S. in it's
slipstream - the average overall punctuality for US airlines in 2003 was 82.0%
compared to Ryanair's record of 91% of flights on time. Not only is Ryanair the
No 1 low fares airline in Europe, we also have proved to be unbeatable for on
-time performance, even when compared to the major US airlines."

                    RYANAIR INVESTS $240 MILLION IN SHANNON
                  NEW BASE TO DELIVER 2 MILLION PASSENGERS P.A.
                          TO CREATE OVER 2,000 NEW JOBS
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today (Tuesday, 30th November 2004)
unveiled Shannon Airport as its 12th major European Base. From May 3rd next
Ryanair will allocate up to four Boeing 737-800 series aircraft to Shannon, and
will operate a network of 14 low fare scheduled routes to the UK and Continental
Europe. Ryanair has guaranteed to deliver 1.3 million passengers in the first
year of this base, rising to 2 million passengers by year 5.
According to ACI figures, these 2m p.a. passengers will generate 2,000 new jobs
in the Shannon region, with the first 200 of these being direct Ryanair
employees (pilots, cabin crew, engineers etc) whose recruitment will begin
immediately.
The routes announced by Ryanair from Shannon include 6 UK destinations as well
Ryanair Holdings PLC RY Invest $240m in Shannon
as 8 European destinations, and all the new routes are launched at fares that
are at least half the price of the high fares presently charged by Aer Lingus
(or their equivalent) on European routes from Cork and Dublin. Shannon Airport
will now become the low fares airport of Ireland.

 *Existing Route
Announcing this $240m base in Shannon, Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
        "This base revolutionises the future growth of Shannon Airport. It would
         not have been possible without the vision and tenacity of the new
         Shannon Airport Authority led by Chairman, Mr Pat Shanahan. In less than
         two months since their appointment, the Board of Shannon has won this
         biggest ever single investment in Irish tourism, despite intense
         competition from seven other low cost European Airports. Had the
         contract not been signed last week, these aircraft would have gone
         instead to Italy to take up opportunities created by the collapse of
         Volare. Instead Ryanair will invest $240 million in Shannon in the next
         12 months and we have guaranteed to deliver 2 million passengers p.a.
         within 5 years which is double Shannon's existing traffic. This new
         traffic will lead to the creation of 2,000 new jobs here in the Shannon
         region.
        "Today's announcement vindicates the policy of former Minister for
         Transport, Seamus Brennan, TD and the Government to break up the Aer
         Rianta monopoly and allow Cork and Shannon Airports the freedom to
         compete with Dublin. This new base will make Shannon Airport the low
         cost gateway to Ireland and promote tourism access to Ireland's western
         seaboard for UK and European visitors. We will use Ryanair's enormous
         presence in Continental Europe to attract hundreds of thousands of
         visitors to the West of Ireland on a year round basis. We look forward
         to working closely with Tourism Ireland and the industry here in the
         Mid-West to ensure that these visitors keep coming again and again.
        "This new base means that passengers using Shannon Airport will now
         enjoy air fares that are at least half the price of Aer Lingus (and
         others) lowest air fares from Dublin and Cork to Europe. Dubliners will
         now be forced to drive to Shannon for low fare access to Europe which
         again shows the pressing need for Bertie Ahern's Government make a
         decision on a competing second terminal at Dublin Airport. The new Board
         at Shannon Airport have shown that enormous tourism and job growth is
         possible if decisions are taken quickly. We call yet again on the
         Taoiseach to put the interests of Irish consumers and tourism first, and
         allow a competing second terminal to be built at Dublin Airport as a
         matter of utmost urgency".

 RYANAIR UPDATE ON AER LINGUS
 Further to Ryanair's H1 results announcement issued today (Nov 5), the following is an update in relation 
to the Aer Lingus offer:
 Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary Said:
 "Consolidation is an essential part of making EU airlines more competitive.  It has already taken place 
in core EU countries via IAG (Iberia and BMI merger), AF\KLM (including their investment in Alitalia) and 
Lufthansa (via takeovers of Austrian, Brussels Airlines and Swiss).  That process is now spreading to 
peripheral countries as Aegean merges with Olympic in Greece, TAP is sold in Portugal and Ryanair bids 
again for Aer Lingus.
 As part of the EU's Phase 2 review which began on August 29, Ryanair has submitted an unprecedented 
remedies package, under which multiple up-front buyers will commit to open new bases in Ireland, and enter 
all of the Ryanair/Aer Lingus crossover routes which are not currently served by other substantial airline 
competitors.  We believe this is the first EU airline merger where the remedies proposed delivers not one, 
but at least two up-front buyer remedies, and where all of the "merger to monopoly routes" are remedied 
not just by passive slot divestments but by active up-front buyers and new market entrants.
 Ryanair is determined to explore all commercial options to address any competition concerns the EU may 
have in order to secure approval for its proposed merger.  The recent BA/BMI (Phase 1) merger approval and 
the subsequent Aegean/Olympic merger proposal vindicate Ryanair's view that its offer for Aer Lingus along 
with the radical remedies package will - if fairly assessed - secure EU competition approval."

Ryanair Statement on Takeover Panel Ruling
Morgan Stanley & Co. Limited and Davy Corporate Finance, financial advisers to
 Ryanair, note today's Announcement (12 December) by the Irish Takeover Panel in
 relation to certain undertakings by Ryanair in respect of its proposed offer for
 Aer Lingus.
In its announcement of 4 Dec., Ryanair undertook that, if its Offer is
 successful, it will:
A)Continue Aer Lingus' trade union recognition policy
 B)    Restore Shannon-Heathrow connectivity
 C)    Provide the Irish Government and Minister for Transport with a legally
 binding guarantee which will ensure that
Aer Lingus' Heathrow slots
 cannot be sold, transferred, leased or switched by Aer Lingus to any other
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Statement on Takeover Panel Ruling
 airline
or any other route without the prior written approval of
 the Irish Minister for Transport
 D)    Provide a EUR100 million bank guarantee
 that Aer Lingus' short haul fares will be reduced by a minimum of 5%
for a three year period post completion
 E)    Provide an additional EUR100 million bank guarantee that Aer Lingus' fuel
 surcharges will be eliminated in their
entirety (for all new
 bookings) within 28 days of completion of the Offer.
These commitments and bank guarantees were intended to provide all Aer Lingus
 stakeholders including its employees, consumers, and the Irish Government an
 absolute assurance that the undertakings put forward by Ryanair in its 1
 December Offer for Aer Lingus would be delivered upon.
Ryanair met with the Minister of Transport in his capacity as custodian of Irish
 national aviation policy solely to highlight the benefits of this Offer for all
 Aer Lingus stakeholders. Ryanair has held similar meetings with other government
 parties, opposition parties, and consumer groups, to highlight in an identical
 manner, how these benefits will be delivered and guaranteed for all
 stakeholders.
Morgan Stanley & Co. Limited and Davy Corporate Finance, on behalf of
 Ryanair, strongly disagree with the decision of the Takeover Panel.
The effect of today's decision by the Irish Takeover Panel seems to render the
 Minister for Transport as an inappropriate representative of consumer and
 stakeholder interests in Aer Lingus during an offer period, while the Minister
 for Finance remains a shareholder in Aer Lingus. This would appear to prevent
 the Minister for Transport or the Government securing the Heathrow slots or
 Ireland's connectivity (in line with national aviation policy), with any party
 who wishes to merge with or acquire Aer Lingus.
Ryanair remains committed to providing these benefits and guarantees to all Aer
 Lingus stakeholders including employees and consumers, who are the ultimate
 beneficiaries of these commitments and Ryanair intends to proceed with the
 proposed Offer including the delivery of these benefits and guarantees in a form
 consistent with the constraints imposed by the Irish Takeover Panel.
Ryanair welcomed today's ruling by the Takeover Panel to compel Aer Lingus to
 provide Ryanair with a copy of its shareholder register, following the Panel's
 ruling that Aer Lingus had breached the Takeover Rules (Rule 10.2).

 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided to 
the CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). When making resource allocation 
decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation decisions are made 
based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in type. The 
objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial results, rather than individual 
routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated adjusted profit/(loss) after tax of 
the Company for the period. This measure excludes the effects of certain income and expense items, which are 
unusual, by virtue of their size and incidence, in the context of the Company's ongoing core operations, such as the 
costs related to the closure of airspace in April and May 2010 due to the Icelandic volcanic ash disruption and the 
impairment of a financial asset investment and accelerated depreciation related to aircraft disposals (see 
reconciliation on page 15).
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed across the 
Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment operations. In addition, as 
the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and liabilities have been allocated to the 
Company's single reportable segment.

21 June 2004
                RYANAIR'S PUNCTUALITY BEATS THE BEST OF THE U.S.
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (Monday, 21st June 2004)
celebrated beating the best of the U.S. airlines for punctuality in April 2004.
Not only is Ryanair the on-time performance leader of all the major European
Airlines each month, but also, according to the latest punctuality statistics
issued by the US Department of Transport, Ryanair has the best on-time
performance compared to all the other US airlines for April 2004.
Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
        "When it comes to punctuality, Ryanair leaves the best of the U.S.
         behind. We have out-preformed all the major U.S airlines in 2003 and
         this trend is continuing into 2004 with average overall punctuality for
         US airlines in April at 83% compared to Ryanair's 94% of flights on
         time. Not only is Ryanair the No 1 airline for low fares and punctuality
         in Europe, we are unbeatable for on-time performance, even when compared
         to the major US airlines."

 RYANAIR CONGRATULATES AER LINGUS ON FINDING A PARTNER WHICH IS EVEN
 WEAKER AND IN WORSE SHAPE THAN AER LINGUS
Ryanair, today (Thursday, 22nd Jan '09), congratulated Aer Lingus on
 the announcement of its "partnership" with United Airlines to operate
 a route between Washington and Madrid - in 15 months time - from
 March 2010 onwards.
This partnership, which joins Aer Lingus to one of the weakest U.S.
 airlines doesn't add one job, one passenger, or one visitor to
 Ireland whatsoever.  United Airlines in 2005 defaulted on pension
 obligations for 122,000 employees, when its $9.8 Billion pension
 default was one of the largest in U.S. history.  Ryanair believes
 that United Airlines is in many ways similar to Aer Lingus.  Both
 have recently announced losses (in United's case a $5.35 Billion -
 yes Billion - loss) for 2008, and both airlines have recently
 announced capacity cuts, route cuts, pay cuts and job cuts.
Responding to this "partnership" today, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary
 said:
"Aer Lingus and United Airways share many similar traits.  They both
 used to be big in the 1950's and 1960's, but sadly today they are
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Congratulates Aer Lingus on Finding a Partner Which is Even Weaker and in 
Worse Shape Th
 just shadows of their former glory.  Both have recently announced
 losses, job cuts and pay cuts.  After months of trawling around
 looking for partners, it is a sad reflection on Aer Lingus that the
 best they could come up with is one of the weakest and biggest loss
 makers in the U.S. airline industry.  Given the scale of United's
 losses there is no guarantee that they will even be around in March
 2010 to operate this "partnership".
"It is hard to think of any transatlantic airline losing any sleep at
 the thought of being faced with the combined weakness of Aer Lingus
 and United Airlines on the Madrid-Washington route.  Today's
 announcement shows just how desperate Aer Lingus is to find a
 partner, any partner it can, even if the flights don't start until
 March 2010.  This so called "partnership" with another "loser" like
 United shows that Aer Lingus has no independent strategy, and no
 prospect of remaining independent.
"Today's "partnership" comes on the back of a series of recent
 flip-flops by Aer Lingus on fuel surcharging, the Heathrow-Shannon
 route and Dermot Mannion's EUR2.8m failure fee and sadly shows that Aer
 Lingus has no credible strategy either for independence or for
 growing traffic, tourism and jobs in Ireland.  Aer Lingus can't match
 Ryanair's prices, it can't match Ryanair's punctuality, and it can't
 match Ryanair's strong growth and vision for the future either".
Ends.

Ryanair Holdings plc
 Notes forming Part of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
 Preliminary Financial Statements
1.  Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland.  The
 unaudited condensed consolidated preliminary financial statements of the Company
 for the year ended March 31, 2010 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries
 (together referred to as the "Group").
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 31,
 2009 are available at www.ryanair.com.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial information included in the
 preliminary announcement is prepared based on accounting policies which are
 consistent with those accounting policies applied in the 2009 annual report.
 The condensed consolidated financial information for the year ended March 31,
 2010 is prepared in accordance with the measurement principles of IFRS as
 adopted by the EU and in compliance with the measurement principles of IFRSs as
 issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, which are effective at
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results -9-
 March 31, 2010.
The condensed consolidated financial information presented herein does not
 constitute the Company's statutory financial statements for the years ended
 March 31, 2010 and 2009, within the meaning of the Companies (Amendment) Act,
 1986. The statutory financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2010 will
 be finalised on the basis of the financial information presented by the
 directors in this preliminary results announcement and, together with the
 independent auditor's report thereon, will be filed with the Irish Registrar of
 Companies following the Company's Annual General Meeting and will also be
 available on the Company's website.  The 2010 annual report and consolidated
 financial statements will be circulated to shareholders shortly.  Statutory
 financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2009 have been filed with the
 Irish Registrar of Companies.  The independent auditor's report on those
 financial statements was unqualified.
The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors,
 approved the preliminary financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2010
 on May 27, 2010.
The following new standards and amendments to standards were adopted by the
 Group for the first time for the financial year beginning April 1, 2009.
·    IFRS 8 - Operating Segments ("IFRS 8").  We adopted IFRS 8 which replaces
 IAS 14 - Segmental Reporting ("IAS 14"), during the year ended March 31, 2010.
 IFRS 8 requires a "management approach" under which segment information is
 presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.  IAS
 14 required identification of two sets of segments - one based on business units
 and the other on geographical areas.  IFRS 8 requires additional disclosures
 around identifying segments and their products and services.  Our operations are
 organised as a single business unit, which is the provision of low-fares
 airline-related activities, including scheduled services, car hire, internet
 income and related sales to third parties.  There has been no change to the
 operating segment as a result of the adoption of IFRS 8 and the reportable
 segment is consistent with that previously reported under the primary business
 segment format of the segment reporting under IAS 14.  The additional
 disclosures around identifying segments and their products and services will be
 disclosed in the 2010 annual financial statements.  Comparative segment
 information will be represented, where necessary, in conformity with the
 requirements of IFRS 8.  Since the change in accounting policy only impacts the
 presentation and disclosure aspects, there is no impact on reported results or
 earnings per share.
·    IAS 1 (revised) - Presentation of Financial Statements.  The revised
 standard prohibits the presentation of items of income and expenses (that is
 "non owner changes in equity") within the statement of changes in equity,
 therefore requiring "non owner changes in equity" to be presented separately
 from owner changes in equity.  All "non owner changes in equity" are required to
 be shown in a performance statement.  Entities can choose whether to present one
 performance statement (the statement of comprehensive income) or two statements
 (the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income).  We have
 elected to present two statements: an income statement and a statement of
 comprehensive income.  Also, the revised standard includes the statement of
 changes in shareholders' equity as a primary statement, rather than as a note to
 the financial statements.  Since the change in accounting policy only impacts
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results -9-
 the presentation and disclosure aspects, there is no impact on reported results
 or earnings per share.
·    Amendment to IFRS 7 "Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments".
 The relevant aspects of the amendment will be addressed in the 2010 Annual
 Report disclosures.
 We have considered all IFRS standards, amendments to these standards and IFRIC
 interpretations that have been issued, but which are not yet effective, and have
 not been early adopted in these financial statements.  The following revised and
 new standards and interpretations will be adopted in future financial
 statements, where applicable.  We do not anticipate that the adoption of these
 new or revised standards and interpretations will have a material impact on our
 financial position or results from operations.
 ·   IFRS 3 (revised 2008), "Business Combinations" (effective for new
 acquisitions occurring in financial years beginning on or after July 1, 2009).
·    Amendment to IAS 27, "Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements"
 (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after July 1, 2009).
·    Amendments to IAS 39, "Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement:
 Eligible Hedged Items" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after July
 1, 2009).
·    IFRIC 17, "Distribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners", (effective for
 fiscal periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009).
·    On April 16, 2009 the IASB published its second annual improvements
 project, "Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards 2009".
 Effective dates are dealt with on a standard-by-standard basis.
·    Amendments to IFRS 2 "Share-based Payment - Group Cash-settled Share-based
 Payment Transactions" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after
 January 1, 2010).
·    Amendment to IAS 32 "Financial Instruments: Presentation - Classification
 of Rights Issues" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after February
 1, 2010).
·    IFRIC 19 "Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity
 Instruments" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after July 1, 2010).
·    IAS 24 (revised 2009), "Related Party Disclosures", (revised 2009)
 (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2011).
·    Amendments to IFRIC 14 "IAS 19 - The Limit on a Defined Benefit Assets,
 Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction" (effective for fiscal
 periods beginning on or after January 1, 2011).
·    IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments"(effective for fiscal periods beginning on or
 after January 1, 2013).
·    On May 6, 2010 the IASB published its third annual improvements project,
 "Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards 2010".  Effective
 dates are dealt with on a standard-by-standard basis.
Exceptional items
 The Company presents certain items separately, which are unusual, by virtue of
 their size and incidence, in the context of our ongoing core operations, as we
 believe this presentation represents the underlying business more accurately and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Results -9-
 reflects the manner in which investors typically analyse the results.  In the
 current and prior period comparative we have presented an impairment of a
 financial asset investment as an exceptional item.  In the prior year
 comparative we have presented accelerated depreciation related to aircraft
 disposals and the impairment of our investment in Aer Lingus separately because
 of the unusual nature of these items.  Any amounts deemed "exceptional" for
 management discussion and analysis purposes have been classified for the
 purposes of the IFRS income statement in the same way as non exceptional amounts
 of the same nature.
2.  Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements,
 estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.  Actual
 results may differ from these estimates.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements
 made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key
 sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the
 most recent published consolidated financial statements.
3.  Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to
 quarter, and management expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors
 causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to general
 economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly the
 first half-year typically results in substantially higher revenues and results.
4.  Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES
 New Low Fare Route between Belgium and Spain
 Brussels-Charleroi - Barcelona-Girona for e39.99
 and celebrated 3 million passengers at Brussels-Charleroi
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airlines, today (Wednesday, 19 March 2003)
 announced the opening of a new route between Belgium and Spain with a new
 daily route between Brussels-Charleroi and Barcelona-Girona with fares
 starting from e39.99 one-way including taxes. The Company also celebrated 3
 million passengers at Brussels-Charleroi.
 Announcing details of the new route, Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael
 O'Leary said:
 "Ryanair's low fares arrived in Brussels in 1997. Once the public
 realised how much they were saving compared to the High Fares airlines
 like Lufthansa, SN Brussels and British Airways we opened a base here in
 2001. From today, there's even more opportunities to save money with our
 new route with passengers saving over 90% on the SN Brussels high fare
 cost to Barcelona.
 "Since our arrival, we've opened 10 routes from Brussels-Charleroi to
 key destinations across Europe including London-Stansted, Rome,
 Carcassonne and Dublin. We've just carried our 3 millionth passenger
 through Brussels-Charleroi, and we're bringing 900,000 visitors to
 Belgium per annum.
 "But it's not just the routes that make us the most popular low-fares
 airline in Europe. We are the Number 1 airline for flights being on
 time, so passengers know when they fly with us they will get to their
 destination on time. And we set our own exacting customer standards,
 such as responding to customer complaints in 7 days, and publish our
 performance - something the high-fare airlines are afraid to do. All
 this while continuing to provide the lowest fares in Europe".

Body
 We are evaluating the effect that the updated standard may have on our consolidated financial statements 
and related disclosures. While we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the new standard, we 
currently believe the most significant impact relates to certain ancillary revenue products.  Due to the 
complexity of certain of our contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the new 
standard for these arrangements may be dependent on contract-specific terms and vary in some instances. 
Our preparatory work is also focused on the increased disclosure obligations (including in respect of 
retrospective revenue and backlog).
 IFRS 16: Leases
 IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet, lease accounting model for lessees.  A lessee recognises a 
right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing 
its obligation to make lease payments. There are optional exemptions for short-term leases and leases of 
low value items.
 The standard is effective for annual report periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Early adoption 
is permitted for entities that apply IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers at or before the date 
of initial application of IFRS 16.
 We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial 
statements and related disclosures but do not expect the impact to be material.
 2.            Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements made 
by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty 
were the same as those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.            Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly, 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.            Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the nine months ended December 
31, 2017 was 10.3% (December 31, 2016: 10.8%).  The tax charge for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -6-
of EUR160.5M (December 31, 2016: EUR152.8M) comprises a current tax charge of EUR154.7M and a deferred tax 
charge of EUR5.8M relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment recognised in 
the income statement.
 5.            Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR4.5M (December 31, 2017: EUR4.5M) is the fair value of 
various share options granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in 
accordance with employee services rendered.
 6.            Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.            Capital commitments
 At December 31, 2017 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 412 (2016: 365) Boeing 737 aircraft.  The Group 
agreed to purchase 183 new Boeing 737-800NG aircraft from the Boeing Corporation during the periods FY15 
to FY19 of which 133 aircraft (including 29 in the nine months) were delivered at December 31, 2017.
 The Group also agreed to purchase up to 210 (110 firm and 100 options) Boeing 737 Max 200 aircraft from 
the Boeing Corporation during the periods FY20 to FY24; these include 10 additional firm orders announced 
in June 2017 which will see aircraft deliveries increase by 5 in both spring 2019 and spring 2020.
 8.            Analysis of operating segment
 The Group is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car-hire, internet income and related sales to third parties. The Group 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided 
to the CEO, who is the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource allocation 
decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data. However, resource allocation decisions are made 
based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in 
type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial 
results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the adjusted profit/(loss) after tax of the 
Group for the period.  All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Group has 
a single reportable segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Group's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed 
across the Group's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment 
operations.  In addition, as the Group is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and 
liabilities have been allocated to the Group's single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

Diluted earnings per share takes account of the potential future exercises of share options granted under 
the Company's share option schemes and the weighted average number of shares includes weighted average 
share options assumed to be converted of 10.5M (2016: 7.5M).
 10.          Property, plant and equipment
 Acquisitions and disposals
 Capital expenditure in the nine months to December 31, 2017 amounted to EUR1,026.6M and primarily relates 
to aircraft pre delivery payments and 29 aircraft deliveries.
 11.          Financial instruments and financial risk management
 The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 These preliminary financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2017 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the period.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --           Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
that the Group can access at the measurement date.

Ryanair Holdings PLC
19 July 2007
              RYANAIR ANNOUNCES 11 NEW ROUTES FROM 7 EUROPEAN BASES
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Thursday, 19th July 2007)
announced 11 new routes from its bases in Barcelona, Bremen, Brussels, Dublin,
London, Marseille and Milan which go on sale today on www.ryanair.com.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Peter Sherrard said;
        "These 11 new routes bring the Ryanair network to 499 routes across 26
         countries and mark the reinstatement of low fare flights between France
         and Morocco following the French Government's refusal in December to
         proceed, as other European countries did, with the prompt application of
         the already agreed EU Morocco open-skies agreement.
        "In the coming year over 50m passengers will enjoy Ryanair's lowest
         fares and no fuel surcharge guarantee, saving EUR5bn compared to the high
         fares and fuel surcharges of Air France, Alitalia, BA, Iberia and
         Lufthansa".

the cost of spare engines purchased.
 12.     Financial instruments and financial risk management
 Financial risk factors
 We are exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. Our financial risk 
exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The 
Company uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 These preliminary financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2013 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --   Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the 
Group can access at the measurement date.
 --   Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that asset 
or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --   Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 12.     Financial instruments and financial risk management (continued)
 Fair value estimation
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Company's financial 
instruments:
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --   Available for sale: The fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is their quoted market bid 
price at the balance sheet date. (Level 1)
 --   Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash-flow analyses have been used to determine the 
fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
 --   Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and carbon swaps: A comparison of the 
contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at March 31, 2014 has 
been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the year to March 31, 2014, there were 
no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy 
used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 Financial instruments disclosed at fair value
 --   Fixed-rate long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at March 31, 2014 to arrive at 
a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
 There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the year to March 31, 
2014 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.
 The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial balance sheet, are as follows:

Body
 Our short haul business model offers low fares which compete with those of other low cost carriers, while delivering 
a compelling product and superior service that passengers value. This business continues to grow and to generate 
high returns on capital. We are clearly meeting customer needs and meeting competition head-on. We cannot allow 
Ryanair to take Aer Lingus' superior brand and customer proposition at a price that fundamentally undervalues our 
business.
In 2007 we expanded Aer Lingus' bases outside the Republic of Ireland for the first time and we have now 
announced a significant new base at London Gatwick. We are extremely excited by this expansion into one of 
Europe's key markets, which has the potential to significantly increase our short haul business and, in turn, 
substantially increase our income, further reducing our unit costs and delivering a high return on your capital.
Our long haul business also continues to grow. We have increased capacity by 30% since the IPO. Our long haul 
service has proven itself against the large US carriers on the Ireland/transatlantic market, and we consistently 
achieve the largest share of this market. We continue to develop strategic alliances with partners such as United 
Airlines and jetBlue to facilitate further development of the long haul business.
The Aer Lingus business model has consistently generated high levels of return since the IPO in 2006 and we 
expect this to continue with the expansion of the business in Ireland and beyond.
Aer Lingus is and will be profitable
2008 has been a very difficult year for all airlines worldwide, as a result of the major increase in fuel prices 
experienced during the year and broader economic uncertainty. IATA, the global air transport organisation, predicts 
that the global airline industry will lose US$5 billion in 2008. Despite these extremely challenging conditions, we 
expect to achieve Profit overall in 2008.
While maintaining revenue is crucial, we expect that significantly reduced fuel prices and a number of management 
cost reduction initiatives will enable Aer Lingus to continue to enhance profitability in 2009 and beyond. I would like 
Aer Lingus Group Plc Offer Rejection -3-
to highlight the recent agreements with SIPTU and IMPACT as a defining moment for Aer Lingus - our employees 
have cooperatively agreed significant changes in work practices and reductions in costs which will allow the airline 
to grow further and will underpin both employment and profitability in the future. As a first step we have 
recommenced operations between Shannon and Heathrow which along with our other London routes will provide 
an important level of business connectivity between London and the west of Ireland.
Aer Lingus has unmatched financial strength
Aer Lingus has a strong balance sheet - one of the strongest in the industry - with total cash reserves of EUR1.3 
billion and net cash of EUR803 million.
Ryanair seeks to pay other shareholders EUR525 million to acquire control of Aer Lingus in order to gain access to 
this EUR1.3 billion cash balance. For this reason alone, the Offer is worthy of rejection. That is before considering 
the market value of our owned fleet of EUR601 million. That is also before considering the value of our other assets 
including Heathrow slots, our fleet orders, our brand, our successful operations and our strong market position.
Aer Lingus does not need Ryanair
Aer Lingus has proven that it can compete with major flag carriers on the one hand and low cost operators on the 
other. This is not a model to be sacrificed for the benefit of Ryanair and its shareholders.
Ryanair has no experience of managing a long haul business. Ryanair has no experience of managing a business 
that offers a superior customer proposition. In fact, it delights in not doing so. Ryanair has no experience of 
managing a unionised workforce in Ireland, and has publicly ridiculed and shown its contempt for employee unions. 
Ryanair's entire experience and focus has been on developing a low fares, low service short haul product.
Ryanair claims that Aer Lingus needs Ryanair to survive and to continue to grow. This is emphatically not the case. 
Aer Lingus has grown strongly in the face of direct and aggressive competition from Ryanair for over twenty years. 
Ryanair seeks to gain opportunity and value from what Aer Lingus has created.
Ryanair's proposition is simple - it is opportunistically attempting to capitalise on current market fears and 
uncertainties to profit from our proven business model and gain access to our huge cash resources and valuable 
assets. Do not let this rip-off happen.
Alternatives to airline consolidation
It has been stated by Ryanair that airline consolidation is happening at a pace in Europe and that such 
consolidation justifies, and indeed requires, that Ryanair be joined with Aer Lingus. This is factually incorrect. Since 
the acquisition of KLM by Air France in October 2003, the European mergers of size that have actually completed 
have involved failing airlines needing to be rescued.
It is simply untrue that Aer Lingus is a uniquely isolated airline incapable of an independent future. The liberalisation 
of airline regulations in Europe has resulted in the development of a vibrant regional European airline industry. 
Airline failures in 2008 have generally been among the smaller, poorly financed and weaker airlines. Aer Lingus, 
with its 10 million passengers, its 106 routes, its 42 aircraft, and its EUR1.3 billion in the bank, is not one of these 
weak carriers. Aer Lingus does not need to be rescued by Ryanair!
In fact, Ryanair has failed to give a coherent explanation on where it stands on consolidation. On the one hand it 
bases the entire logic of the Offer as being a need to combine forces to create one Irish airline, and on the other 
hand Ryanair has argued that Aer Lingus will be separate from, and not managed by, Ryanair! Is it credible that 
Ryanair is really going to allow Aer Lingus to operate separately, with the existing management team, employees 
and business? What is Ryanair adding? We don't believe Ryanair. It will be a monopoly. It will be a monopoly that 
will flatter to deceive and give meaningless guarantees. That is what monopolies do.
The Offer is diversionary and flawed
Aer Lingus Group Plc Offer Rejection -3-
Ryanair's first bid for Aer Lingus was fatally flawed - and Ryanair has publicly acknowledged this. The European 
Commission ruled against Ryanair's last bid for Aer Lingus because of the anti-competitive nature of the combined 
entity. The Board sees no reason to believe the Commission would change its view, particularly as the level of 
competition between Aer Lingus and Ryanair has increased and a number of airlines have withdrawn from Irish 
routes in the interim. Ryanair's appeal of this ruling is still outstanding.
Ryanair's posturing around this lower bid is pointless, and, we believe, will ultimately prove futile. Ryanair has not 
offered any new remedies nor provided any new evidence that clearance could be achieved. It has at its heart the 
same flaws in relation to shareholder value, passenger choice and credibility as its original diversionary attempt in 
2006.
In the longer term, we believe that Ryanair's maintenance of a 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus - and use of this 
position to continue to harass Aer Lingus commercially in order to deflect Aer Lingus management from its 
continued progress - is a gross breach of the principles of competition. This distraction and the considerable 
expense incurred in responding to the unsolicited offer, especially in the absence of a comprehensive competition 
solution being provided by Ryanair, is to the significant detriment of Aer Lingus' other shareholders. Aer Lingus 
continues to pursue remedies to this situation.
Take no action
Ignore Ryanair's threats, contradictions and insinuations. Aer Lingus is a strong, growing, cash-rich and valuable 
airline that is dedicated to providing its customers with choice and with a high quality product, its employees with a 
vibrant workplace and its shareholders with superior returns. Do not hand over this value to our main competitor. 
Reject Ryanair's bid.
The Directors believe that Ryanair's Offer does not reflect the true value of the company based on its market 
position, its fleet, its cash and its brand. These assets will produce greater value for our shareholders in the future. 
The Directors, who have been so advised by Goldman Sachs International and Boodbody Corporate Finance, 
believe that the Offer significantly undervalues Aer Lingus. In providing advice to the Directors, Goldman Sachs 
International and Boodbody Corporate Finance have relied upon the commercial assessments of the Directors.
Accordingly, the Directors unanimously recommend that you take no action in relation to the Offer. The Directors 
will not be accepting the Offer in respect of their own legal and beneficial holdings of Aer Lingus Shares.
The way to reject the Offer is to take no action. Do not sign any document which Ryanair or its advisers send you.
Yours faithfully,
Colm BarringtonChairman
No Better Competitor
"Aer Lingus is one of the most successful airlines in Europe in the way it has transformed its business model to 
profitably compete in the ultra-competitive low fare short haul market.
Although we are a low fare airline, Aer Lingus still provides a superior service offering with a strong brand and 
leading market position, and this has been the platform for profitable growth.
We have grown our fleet by 20% to 42 aircraft since the IPO in late 2006, and have additional orders for a further 
12. Passenger numbers have increased by over 17% since the IPO. Growth has been achieved in both our short 
haul and long haul businesses.
In relation to our short haul business, load factors are very robust in the face of both intense competition and the 
challenging economic environment. Our load factor was 77.6% in the 11 months to end November 2008.

    Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated
     depreciation and provisions for impairments, if any. Depreciation is
     calculated so as to write off the cost, less estimated residual value of
     assets, on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives at the
     annual rates in the table above.
    Aircraft are depreciated over their estimated useful lives to estimated
     residual values as detailed in the table above.
    An element of the cost of an acquired aircraft is attributed on acquisition
     to its service potential reflecting the maintenance condition of its engines
     and airframe. This cost, which can equate to a substantial element of the
     total aircraft cost, is amortised over the shorter of the period to the next
     check (usually between 8 and 12 years for Boeing 737-800 "next generation"
     aircraft) or the remaining life of the aircraft.
    The costs of subsequent major airframe and engine maintenance checks are
     capitalised and amortised over the shorter of the period to the next check
     or the remaining useful life of the aircraft.
    Advance and option payments made in respect of aircraft purchase commitments
     and options are recorded at cost and separately disclosed as part of
     tangible fixed assets. On acquisition of the related aircraft these payments
     are included as part of the cost of aircraft and are depreciated from that
     date.
    Cash and Cash Equivalents
     Cash represents cash held at bank and available on demand, offset by bank
     overdrafts.
    Cash equivalents are current asset investments (other than cash) that are
     readily convertible into known amounts of cash. Cash equivalents include
     investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposit and cash deposits
Ryanair Holdings PLC ExplanationofFinancial -4-
     of more than one day, but less than three months. Deposits with a maturity
     of greater than three months are recognised as short term investments.
    Inventories
     Inventories, principally representing rotable aircraft spares, are stated at
     the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on invoiced price
     on a weighted average basis for all stock categories. Net realisable value
     is calculated as estimated selling price net of estimated selling costs.
    Trade and Other Receivables and Payables
     Trade and other receivables and payables are stated at cost less impairment
     losses, which approximates to fair value given the short dated nature of
     these assets and liabilities.
    Derivative Financial Instruments
     Ryanair is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity
     prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates. The objective of
     financial risk management at Ryanair is to minimize the impact of commodity
     price, interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the Group's
     earnings, cash flows and equity.
    To manage these risks, Ryanair uses various derivative financial
     instruments, including interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward
     contracts and commodity contracts. These derivative financial instruments
     are generally held to maturity and are not actively traded. The Group enters
     into these arrangements with the goal of hedging its operational and balance
     sheet risk. However, Ryanair's exposure to commodity price, interest rate
     and currency exchange rate fluctuations cannot be neutralized completely.
    From 1 April 2005, the company has applied the provisions of IAS 39 in
     accounting for its derivatives. Derivative financial instruments are
     recognised initially at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative
     financial instruments are stated at fair value. Recognition of any resultant
     gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
    The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group
     would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking
     into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the
     swap counterparties. The fair value of forward exchange contracts and jet
     fuel contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being
     the present value of the quoted forward price.
    Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the
     variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability or a highly
     probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on
     the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity. When
     the forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or
     liability, the cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included
     in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. Otherwise the
     cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income
     statement at the same time as the hedged transaction. The ineffective part
     of any hedging transaction and the gain or loss therein is recognised in the
     income statement immediately.
    When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged
     transaction still is expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that
     point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above
     policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer
     expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in
     equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
    Where a derivative financial instrument hedges the changes in fair value of
     a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, any gain
     or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement. The
     hedged item also is stated at fair value in respect of the risk being
     hedged, with any gain or loss also being recognised in the income statement.
Ryanair Holdings PLC ExplanationofFinancial -4-
    Under Irish GAAP and as applied in the periods to 31 March 2005, Ryanair's
     fuel forward contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate
     swaps were treated as hedges, and any unrealised gains or losses arising on
     those contracts were deferred and recognized as an offset to the related
     expenses, when realized.
    Business Combinations
     The purchase method of accounting is employed in accounting for the
     acquisition of businesses. In accordance with IFRS 3, the cost of a business
     combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values at the date of
     exchange of assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed in exchange for
     control, together with any directly attributable expenses. The assets and
     liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity are measured
     at their fair values at the date of acquisition. When the initial accounting
     for a business combination is determined provisionally, any adjustments to
     the provisional values allocated are made within twelve months of the
     acquisition date and are effected prospectively from that date.
    Interest Bearing Loans and Borrowings
     All loans and borrowings are initially recorded at cost, being the fair
     value of the consideration received, net of attributable transaction costs.
     Subsequent to initial recognition, non-current interest bearing loans are
     measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest yield methodology.
    Financial Assets
     Financial assets comprise cash deposits of greater than three months

The Company has accounted for its share option grants to employees at fair value, in accordance with IFRS 2, 
using a binomial lattice model to value the option grants. This has resulted in a charge of EUR3.3 million (2010: 
EUR4.9 million; 2009: EUR3.8 million) being recognised within the income statement in respect of employee 
services rendered, which was based on 22.6 million share options within the scope of IFRS 2 (2010: 23.2 million; 
2009: 23.7 million) as compared to the total share options disclosed above (as permitted by the transitional rules in 
IFRS 1).
 The weighted average fair value of the individual options granted during the years ended March 31, 2009 were 
estimated, using a binomial lattice model, based on the following assumptions. There were no share options 
granted during the years ended March 31, 2010 and 2011.

 17 Analysis of operating revenues and segmental analysis
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related services, including 
scheduled services, internet and other related services to third parties across a European route network. The 
Company operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided to 
Michael O'Leary, CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). When making resource 
allocation decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation decisions are 
made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in type. 
The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial results, rather than 
results on individual routes within the network.

 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related services, 
including scheduled services, internet and other related services to third parties across a European route 
network. The Company operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route 
scheduling system.
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to Michael O'Leary, CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). When making 
resource allocation decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation 
decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, 
which are uniform in type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise 
consolidated financial results, rather than results on individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated adjusted profit/(loss) after 
tax of the Company for the year. This measure excludes the effects of certain income and expense items, 
which are unusual, by virtue of their size and incidence, in the context of the Company's ongoing core 
operations, such as the impairment of a financial asset investment, accelerated depreciation related to 
aircraft disposals and Icelandic volcanic ash related costs.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and, as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, inter-segment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset class comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly 
employed across the Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable 
segment operations.   In addition, as the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets 
and liabilities have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
 There have been no changes to the basis of segmentation or the measurement basis for the segment profit 
or loss since the prior year.
 Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

 OPEN LETTER
 Re:      Aer Lingus Group plc - Refusal of EGM requisition
 Dear Donal,
 I refer to your letter of yesterday's date.
 As you will be aware, Ryanair wrote to the Board of Aer Lingus requisitioning an EGM on 1 November. Aer 
Lingus rejected this EGM request on 4 November and despite 3 reminder letters the Board of Aer Lingus has 
failed / refused to explain its refusal to accede to Ryanair's EGM requisition, which is in breach of 
Irish company law and EU shareholder rights legislation. This is not an issue to be fobbed off to Aer 
Lingus' lawyers and these delays are unacceptable. The Board of Aer Lingus should explain, by return, the 
grounds for their refusal to accede to Ryanair's EGM requisition, and do so without further unnecessary 
delay.
 It is clear that the Board of Aer Lingus is seeking to unlawfully delay or obstruct the calling of this 
EGM solely because the requisition comes from Ryanair. The timelines you refer to in S. 132 of the 
Companies Act, 1963 are irrelevant.
 We again request the Board of Aer Lingus to reply by return to our 2 letters of 9 November and further 
letter of 10 November setting out the reasons for their refusal to accede to Ryanair's EGM requisition 
dated 1 November.
 We would appreciate your response by close of business today to prevent any further delay by the Board of 
Aer Lingus in complying with Irish company law and EU shareholder rights legislation.
 Yours sincerely,

 RYANAIR CALLS ON AIR BERLIN AND LUFTHANSA TO REDUCE THEIR UNFAIR SURCHARGES AS
 OIL FALLS OVER 50% TO $60 PER BARREL
 RELEASES 1 MILLION, EUR1 SEATS ON SALE FOR TRAVEL NOV - JAN
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Monday, 27th October 2008)
 celebrated the start of its third German domestic route from Berlin to
 Dusseldorf and the launch of its 800th European route from Dusseldorf to
 Bologna, with a press conference in Berlin at which Ryanair called on Air Berlin
 and Lufthansa to reduce their unfair fuel surcharges by at least 50% to reflect
 the recent 55% fall in oil prices from over $140 to less than $70 per barrel.
 Ryanair believes it is unfair that German consumers are still suffering high
 fuel surcharges at Air Berlin and Lufthansa which were last increased when oil
 was $140 a barrel and said that the failure of these German airlines to reduce
 fuel surcharge in line with the recent dramatic fall in oil prices exposes yet
 again the fact that Air Berlin and Lufthansa are overcharging consumers.
Ryanair, which will carry 9 million passengers to/from Germany this year on its
 137 German routes continues to grow rapidly in Germany thanks to Ryanair's
 unique combination of guaranteed lowest fares, guarantee of no fuel surcharges
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR CALLS A BERLIN/LUFT TO CUT SURCHARGES
 and better punctuality and customer service than that delivered by either
 Lufthansa or Air Berlin. Ryanair confirmed that its Berlin passenger numbers
 have grown by 50% in the last year, while its three German bases at (Bremen,
 Dusseldorf Weese and Frankfurt Hahn) continue to grow strongly as German
 passengers/visitors abandon high fare airlines like Air Berlin and Lufthansa in
 favour of Ryanair's lowest fares and guarantee of no surcharges.
To celebrate Ryanair's rapid German market growth, its third German domestic
 route and its 800th European route, Ryanair today released 1 million, EUR1 seats
 (incl. taxes and charges) for travel from 15th November to 31st January next.
 These seats go on sale from midnight Monday 27th until Midnight Thursday 30th
 October, and mean that German consumers/visitors travelling from any of
 Ryanair's ten German airports can now travel all over Europe in November,
 December and January for as little as EUR1, which is less than one twentieth of
 the fuel surcharges being levied by Air Berlin and Lufthansa on their German
 domestic routes.

 +-------------------------+-------------------------+
Speaking in Berlin today, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"Ryanair's growth in Berlin and in Germany has never been faster, or more
 important for German consumers and visitors. With Air Berlin and Lufthansa
 continuing to charge high fares and unfair fuel surcharges and the failure of
 these airlines to reduce these surcharges despite the 50% plus fall in fuel
 prices in recent months, it is now more important than ever that Ryanair gives
 German consumers and visitors a real choice over the high fare, fuel surcharging
 German airlines. German consumers/visitors have in recent months come to realise
 that the only way to avoid high fares and fuel surcharges is to book their
 travel on www.ryanair.com and fly on any one of Ryanair's 137 German routes from
 our 10 German airports including Berlin, Frankfurt Hahn, Bremen,
 Friedrichshafen, Hamburg, Rostock, Leipzig, Dusseldorf Weeze, Zweibrucken and
 Karlsruhe.
"Ryanair calls on the German Consumer Agencies or the useless Competition
 Organisation to ask Air Berlin and Lufthansa why despite the 50% fall in oil
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR CALLS A BERLIN/LUFT TO CUT SURCHARGES
 prices, they still haven't reduced their unfair and unjustified fuel surcharges.
 Why for example when Ryanair can offer a million seats for just EUR1, are Air
 Berlin still charging a short-haul fuel surcharge of EUR25 and Lufthansa charging
 EUR24.  Clearly these German airlines are using fuel surcharges as another excuse
 to overcharge passengers, which is what is driving more and more passengers
 towards Ryanair, and maintaining Ryanair's record route and traffic growth in
 the German market.
"To celebrate Ryanair's third domestic German route and our 800th European
 route, we are releasing 1 million, EUR1 seats for travel in November, December and
 January tonight at midnight. These seats will be available for booking all day
 Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, but we advise all passengers only to book these
 EUR1 flights
 directly  www.ryanair.com and avoid any screenscraper, ticket-tout websites who
 may try to deceive consumers by adding on unauthorised and hidden handling fees
 of between 10 or 20 times Ryanair's ticket prices".
The message for Germany today from Ryanair is "Guten Tag" Ryanair's lowest
 fares, "Auf Wiedersehen" Air Berlin and Lufthansa's high, unfair fuel
 surcharges.

19 June 2006
                      RYANAIR CALLS ON EUROPEAN COMMISSION
                           TO EXPEDITE INVESTIGATION
                   AFTER FURTHER ABUSE OF PSO RULES IN ITALY
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Monday, 19th June 2006)
announced that it has written to the European Commission about the latest abuse
of the PSO rules in Italy. Ryanair contacted the Commission following the
announcement that Alitalia would be allowed to fly on a PSO route that it did
not even apply for in the first place!
When the Italian Civil Aviation Authority blocked Ryanair and Easyjet from
offering low fares, competition and choice to consumers between mainland Italy
and Sardinia in May, the European Commission launched an investigation into the
application of PSO rules in Italy. The PSO rules are being abused by the Italian
authorities to protect high fare Italian airlines and block low fares and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Expedite Investigation of PSO
competition.
Speaking today, Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications said:
        "We are calling on the European Commission to reach a speedy conclusion
         to its investigation. Italian consumers are being forced to pay fares 4
         times higher than last year to fly between mainland Italy and Sardinia
         because the Italian authorities have systematically abused the PSO rules
         to protect high fare Italian airlines and block low fares and
         competition.
        "Following the announcement that Alitalia will be allowed to fly on a
         PSO route between mainland Italy and Sardinia that it did not even apply
         for, Ryanair is asking the Commission to investigate the following
         further abuses of the PSO rules:
 1)  Why has Alitalia been allowed to operate on a PSO route that it never
      applied for?
  2)  Why did Meridiana suddenly offer Alitalia a codeshare agreement on its PSO
      route after "mediation" by the Italian Ministry of Transport?
  3)  Why did AirOne and Meridiana agree to take on Alitalia's 100 Sardinian
      employees after the President of the Sardinian region declared that their
      jobs would be safe?
        "Italian consumers should not be denied choice and forced to pay higher
         fares because of the Italian Authorities' clumsy attempts to protect
         high fare Italian airlines. We are therefore calling on the Commission
         to take immediate action to end these abuses and allow competition and
         low fares on the Sardinian routes".
Ends.                                 Monday, 19th June 2006

Update to Shareholders on Aer Lingus Cost Improvements
Ryanair's Offer Fails to Achieve Aer Lingus Shareholder Support
In advance of a number of meetings with shareholders, Aer Lingus today provides a further update to shareholders 
in relation to its continued cost improvements and outlook for the business and its financial condition.
Fuel and Currency Hedging Positions as at 31 December 2008
Aer Lingus confirms that the fuel hedging position of the company as at 31 December 2008 is 72% cover for 2009 
at a price of US$911 per tonne; and, 22% cover for 2010 at a price of US$876 per tonne. The 2009 position has 
improved from Aer Lingus' previously disclosed position of 64% of 2009 requirements hedged at US$995.
The continued fall in fuel prices has allowed Aer Lingus to be the first transatlantic airline to eliminate fuel 
surcharges completely. The elimination of the fuel surcharge has been incorporated in the expectations of the 
Board that Aer Lingus will report a Profit in 2008 and 2009.
Aer Lingus Group Plc Statement re Shareholder Update
In addition, Aer Lingus confirms that it has hedged 100% of its dollar trading exposure for 2009 at a rate of 
US$1.48, 72% of its dollar trading exposure for 2010 at a rate of US$1.48 and 23% of its dollar trading exposure for 
2011 at a rate of US$1.42. In addition, the Company has put over US$870m of cover in place for capital 
expenditure on future aircraft deliveries at a blended rate of better than US$1.44. Finally, the Company confirms 
that cover for over 70% of its expected 2009 Sterling surplus is in place at a rate of GBP0.76 to the euro.
Cost reduction programme to deliver at least EUR50 million annual cost savings
On 8 December, 2008, Aer Lingus announced that it was on track to deliver at least EUR50 million in annual cost 
savings following the positive agreements with SIPTU and IMPACT. The process for implementing these 
agreements has not yet been completed and, therefore, the savings and associated exceptional costs of 
implementing the cost reductions have not been finalised. Aer Lingus will update shareholders on the exact costs of 
implementation once these are finalised. Further cost reductions in the areas of professional fees, marketing and 
distribution, and airport and other costs will also be delivered.
The agreements with staff, combined with a significant reduction in the cost of fuel, underpin Aer Lingus' ability to 
deliver growth for the future. The central objective of the cost reduction programme is to ensure Aer Lingus 
maintains a competitive cost base that can underpin the profitable growth of the airline. The re-opening of a 
Shannon / Heathrow service, following discussions with Aer Lingus staff and Shannon Airport Authority over a 
number of months, is a clear demonstration of this.
Pension contributions
As outlined in the IPO listing particulars and again in the Company's annual report there are two principle schemes 
(one of which is a multi-employer scheme with DAA and SR Technics (the "Main Scheme")) to which Aer Lingus 
makes fixed contributions which do not vary according to the funding level of the schemes. As the Company 
contribution rate is entirely independent of the funding levels of the schemes, the value of the schemes assets and 
liabilities are not relevant in the context of reporting under IAS 19, Retirement Benefits.
Financial outlook
Aer Lingus' guidance for 2008 remains unchanged. We expect to report a Profit despite an operating loss of 
approximately EUR20 million.
Aer Lingus also expects to report a Profit in 2009. The 2009 financial outcome includes the impact of lower net 
interest income and the benefits of the recently agreed cost reduction programme and the significant reduction in 
fuel prices. Aer Lingus' profit forecast has been independently reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers and their 
report is set out at Appendix VI of the circular to shareholders published on 22 December 2008, as required by the 
Takeover Rules.
In August, 2008, Aer Lingus guided towards a net cash balance of EUR550 million for 2009 at a time when the 
Group anticipated a significant loss in 2009, when fuel was expected to be US$117 a barrel, before any of the cost 
savings previously mentioned had been achieved, and on the basis that the two A330 purchases in 2009 - replacing 
two leased units - were debt financed.
Aer Lingus now expects significantly higher cash balances resulting from a substantially better performance in 2009 
than was anticipated in August and the positive impacts of funding arrangements available for the 2009 aircraft 
deliveries, offset by one-off cash costs associated with the implementation of our cost reduction programme. Aer 
Lingus will also incur costs in the defence of the unsolicited Offer by Ryanair. While these costs will be substantially 
below the amount incurred in the defence of Ryanair's previous unsolicited offer in 2006, Aer Lingus regrets this 
unnecessary waste of shareholder's cash especially as the Ryanair Offer is not capable of completion.
On 11 November, 2008 Aer Lingus announced a reduction to short haul capacity for the Winter 2008/09 season in 
response to economic conditions. Aer Lingus management had always planned for further growth in short haul in 
Aer Lingus Group Plc Statement re Shareholder Update
2009 and this growth will be further enhanced by the opening of the Gatwick base. The current long haul fleet is an 
8 aircraft operation and Aer Lingus expects to grow this business over the medium term.
The circular published by Aer Lingus on 22 December, 2008 further elaborates on Aer Lingus' proven track record 
and excellent prospects.
Ryanair's Offer Fails to Achieve Aer Lingus Shareholder Support
The Board notes the extremely low level of acceptances received by Ryanair in respect of its unsolicited and 
unwelcome Offer for Aer Lingus. Excluding its own holding, Ryanair has received a pathetic 0.01% acceptance 
level from Aer Lingus shareholders reflecting the unanimous view of the Aer Lingus Board that the Offer 
significantly undervalues Aer Lingus and is not capable of completion.
It is a fact that Ryanair is currently prohibited from acquiring control of Aer Lingus under the EC Merger Regulation. 
Ryanair's current offer cannot be completed until Ryanair makes a fresh submission under the EC Merger 
Regulation and obtains a clearance. Ryanair has not provided any indication of how it would construct a viable 
remedy package under the EC Merger Regulation and therefore there is no basis to believe that the Ryanair offer is 
capable of completion.
Certain terms used in this announcement, including certain technical and other terms, are defined and explained in 
the circular to shareholders published on 22 December 2008.

 The Group is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, including 
scheduled services, car-hire, internet income and related sales to third parties. The Group operates a single fleet of 
aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided to the 
CEO, who is the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource allocation decisions the 
CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data. However, resource allocation decisions are made based on the 
entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in type.  The objective in 
making resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial results, rather than individual routes 
within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the adjusted profit/(loss) after tax of the Group for 
the period.  All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Group has a single 
reportable segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Group's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed across the 
Group's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment operations.  In addition, as the 
Group is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and liabilities have been allocated to the Group's 
single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

 11.          Financial instruments and financial risk management
 The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 These preliminary financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2016 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the period.
 Fair value hierarchy
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -6-
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --           Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
that the Group can access at the measurement date.
 --           Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
that asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --           Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 Fair value estimation
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --           Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to determine 
the fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
 --           Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and carbon swaps: A comparison of 
the contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at March 31, 2017 
has been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the year to March 31, 2017, there were 
no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy 
used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 Financial instruments disclosed at fair value
 --           Fixed-rate long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been 
discounted at the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at March 31, 
2017 to arrive at a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
 There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the year to March 31, 
2017 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.
 The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial balance sheet, are as follows:

   As support packages unwind, we expect there to be some capital needs that may throw up interesting 
opportunities for us to act.  Currently we find the most valuable activity we can do with the portfolio is the most 
undervalued and underrated of all, which is to do nothing.  We would have done a lot better over the past 23 years 
if we had been better at doing nothing.
   Upside to intrinsic value is our key metric when we consider valuation. At the time of writing in late-September it 
stands at 80%, which highlights the potential in the portfolio.
   Castelnau Group
   In the same June 2021 factsheet, we announced that the Castelnau Group vehicle would be listed in the near 
future, and it was our intention, with the Board's agreement, that Aurora participate. The Board agreed but the 
participation required a shareholder vote because the Company is presently unable to hold a fund which Phoenix 
manages. The General Meeting was held on 28 September 2021 at which shareholders approved all resolutions 
proposed, including an amendment to the Company's Investment Policy and authorising the Company to 
participate.
   The Castelnau Group Prospectus was published on 23 September 2021 and trading will begin on 18 October 
2021. As outlined in previous communication, the Company will exchange shares in Dignity PLC, Hornby and 
Phoenix Stanley Gibbons for shares in Castelnau Group. The initial weight of Castelnau Group in the Company's 
portfolio will be 15%.

  INTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT
   The Directors are required to provide an Interim Management Report in accordance with the Financial 
Conduct Authority's ("FCA") Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules ("DTR"). The Directors consider 
that the Investment Manager's Review shown above provide details of the important events which have 
occurred during the period and their impact on the financial statements. The following statement on the 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties, the Related Party Transactions, the Statement of Directors' 
Responsibilities and the Investment Manager's Review together constitute the Interim Management Report of 
the Company for the six months ended 30 June 2020. The outlook for the Company for the remaining six 
months of the year ending 31 December 2020 is discussed in the Investment Manager's Review.
   Details of the investments held at the period end and the structure of the portfolio at the period end 
are provided above.
   PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
   The principal risks and uncertainties of the Company are detailed on pages 27 to 29 of the Company's 
most recent Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2020 which can be found on the Company's website 
at www.aurorainvestmenttrust.com. The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company remain 
unchanged from those disclosed in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2020 and the Board are 
of the opinion that they will continue to remain unchanged for the forthcoming six month period.
   The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company are as follows:
    --         Brexit;
   --         Portfolio Risk: including poor stock selection, poor use of gearing, illiquid stock and a 
concentrated portfolio;
    --         The COVID-19 pandemic which continues to impact the Company;
    --         Operational Risks; and
    --         Corporate governance and regulatory risks.
   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Aurora Investment Trust PLC Half-year Report -2-
   The Company's Investment Manager is Phoenix Asset Management Partners Limited, ('Phoenix' or the 
'Investment Manager'). Phoenix is considered a related party in accordance with the Listing Rules. Phoenix 
does not earn an ongoing annual management fee. It will be paid an annual performance fee equal to one 
third of the outperformance of the Company's net asset value total return (including dividends and 
adjusted for the impact of share buybacks and the issue of new shares) over the FTSE All-Share Index total 
return for each financial year. Details of the investment management arrangements are shown in note 5 
below.
   The Board are also considered related parties. Further details of the Board's remuneration and 
shareholdings can be found on page 54 of the Company's Annual Report.
   At a General Meeting held on 28 September 2021 shareholders approved the transfer of certain of the 
Company's assets to Castelnau Group ('Castelnau'), a company managed by Phoenix, in exchange for shares in 
Castelnau. As a result of managing Castelnau, the Investment Manager may be paid a performance fee by 
Castelnau. As explained above, Phoenix is a related party of the Company and will benefit from the 
Company's transaction with Castelnau through the establishment of the new fund. Therefore, the transfer of 
assets by the Company to Castelnau in exchange for shares in Castelnau constitutes a related party 
transaction under LR11.1.7R.
   GOING CONCERN
   The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. The Directors have a reasonable 
expectation, after making enquiries, that the Company has adequate resources to continue in existence for 
at least 12 months from the date of approval of this document. In reaching this conclusion, the Directors 
have considered the liquidity of the Company's portfolio of investments as well as its cash position, 
income and expense flows. As at 30 June 2021, the Company held GBP10,605,000 (30 June 2020: GBP6,591,000) 
in cash, GBP152,787,000 (30 June 2020: GBP107,349,000) in quoted investments and GBP13,327,000 (30 June 
2020: GBP7,601,000) in an unquoted investment. It is estimated that the majority of the portfolio could be 
realised in seven days under normal conditions. The total operating expenses for the six months to 30 June 
2021 was GBP349,000 (30 June 2020: GBP299,000).
   In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Directors have fully considered and assessed the Company's 
portfolio of investments. A prolonged and deep market decline could lead to falling values in the 
Company's investments or interruptions to cashflow. However, the Company currently has more than 
sufficient liquidity available to meet any future obligations.
   The market and operational risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ongoing economic impact 
of measures introduced to combat its spread are continually monitored by the Board. The Investment 
Manager, Administrator and other key service providers are providing regular updates on operational 
resilience, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Board is satisfied that the key service providers have 
the ability to continue their operations efficiently in a remote or virtual working environment.

 2.       Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in 
applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as 
those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.        Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Accordingly 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.       Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the year ended March 31, 2014 
was 11.6% (March 31, 2013: 12.5%).  The tax charge for the year ended March 31, 2014 of EUR68.6m (March 
31, 2013: EUR81.6m) comprises a deferred tax charge relating to the temporary differences for property, 
plant and equipment recognised in the income statement.
 5.         Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements.  The charge of EUR1.9m is the fair value of various share options 
granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in accordance with 
employee services rendered.
 6.         Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.          Capital commitments
 At March 31, 2014 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 297 (2013: 305) Boeing 737-800NG aircraft.  Following 
shareholder approval at an EGM on June 18, 2013, the Group has agreed to purchase 175 new Boeing 737 800NG 
aircraft between fiscal 2015 and 2019. The Company also agreed on April 30, 2014, to purchase a further 5 
Boeing 737 800NG for delivery in fiscal 2016, bringing the total order to 180 Boeing 737-800NG aircraft.
 8.       Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR221.2m at March 31, 2013 to EUR260.3m at 
March 31, 2014 is comprised of a gain of EUR39.1m, recognised through other comprehensive income, 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -5-
reflecting the increase in the Aer Lingus share price from EUR1.39 per share at March 31, 2013 to EUR1.64 
per share at March 31, 2014.
 9.       Analysis of operating segment
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car hire, internet income and related sales to third parties. The Company 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource 
allocation decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation 
decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, 
which are uniform in type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise 
consolidated financial results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated profit/(loss) after tax of 
the Company for the period.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed 
across the Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment 
operations.  In addition, as the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and 
liabilities have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

Ryanair Holdings PLC
22 November 2007
                        RYANAIR SUES EUROPEAN COMMISSION
                FOR ITS FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE ILLEGAL STATE AID
                              TO OLYMPIC AIRLINES
Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today (Thursday, 22nd November
2007) lodged a case in the European Court of First Instance against the European
Commission's failure to act on Ryanair's complaint about a further approximately
EUR500 million worth of illegal State aid to Olympic Airlines, granted through
bogus "arbitration" proceedings involving certain "services" allegedly provided
by Olympic to the Greek Government. The Greek Government was found guilty of
providing hundreds of millions to Olympic to bail it out in the past and this is
the latest attempt to prop up this failed national carrier. Ryanair has called
on the Commission to investigate this obvious abuse of EU competition rules
already in 2006, but the Commission has so far failed to do so.
Ryanair Holdings PLC CFI ACTION-OLYMPIC COMPLAINT
Announcing the launch of these proceedings Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO, said:
        "This is just another example of the Commission's twin track approach to
         State aid in the air transport sector. On one hand they continue to
         waste time and taxpayers money investigating baseless complaints against
         standard free market deals at regional and secondary airports, for
         example Tampere and Alghero. These complaints were filed by inefficient
         high fare flag carrier airlines operating at expensive hub airports, who
         would never fly to smaller airports and are simply trying to prevent
         competition and consumer choice.
        "On the other hand, the Commission repeatedly ignores blatant State aid
         to Air France, Lufthansa, Olympic, Alitalia and others. The Greek
         Government's most recent tranche of State aid to Olympic involves
         approximately EUR500 million, mostly for "unpaid services" allegedly
         provided by Olympic to the Government. However, the Commission has
         refused to do anything about this since 2006, which left us with no
         alternative but to challenge the Commission's inaction in the European
         courts.
        "It appears that the Commission applies two approaches to enforcing the
         State aid rules: one of ignoring or signing off on continuing unlawful
         State aid for the inefficient high fare flag carrier airlines, and the
         other of pursuing baseless complaints by flag carriers against low fares
         airlines operating out of regional and secondary airports. This twin
         track approach must end and we are therefore calling on the Commission
         to start promoting competition, end unlawful State aid, and stop
         protecting flag carrier airlines".
Ends.                                    Thursday, 22nd November 2007

 After making enquiries, the directors have formed a judgment, at the time of approving the financial statements, 
that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group as a whole have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements. The directors' responsibility for preparing the financial 
statements is explained on page 27 and the reporting responsibilities of the auditors are set out in their report on 
page 29.
 Compliance Statement
 Ryanair has complied, throughout the year ended March 31, 2011, with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the 
Combined Code except as outlined below. The Group has not complied with the following provisions of the 
Combined Code, but continues to review these situations on an ongoing basis:
 -- Non-executive directors participate in the Company's share option plans. The Combined Code requires that, if 
exceptionally, share options are granted to non-executive directors that shareholder approval should be sought in 
advance and any shares acquired by exercise of the options should be held until at least one year after the non-
executive director leaves the board. In accordance with the Combined Code, the Company sought and received 
shareholder approval to make certain stock option grants to its non-executive directors and as described above, the 
Board believes the quantum of options granted to non-executive directors is not so significant to impair their 
independence.
 -- Certain non-executive directors, namely Mr. David Bonderman, Mr. James Osborne, Mr. Kyran McLaughlin, Mr. 
Michael Horgan and Mr. Paolo Pietrogrande, have each served more than nine years on the Board without being 
offered for annual re-election. As described further above, given the other significant commercial and professional 
commitments of these non-executive directors, and taking into account that their independence is considered 
annually by the Board, the Board does not consider their independence to be impaired in this regard.
 On behalf of the Board
 D. Bonderman M. O' Leary

 All members of the Remuneration Committee have access to the advice of the Chief Executive and may, in the 
furtherance of their duties, obtain independent professional advice at the Company's expense.
 Remuneration Policy
 The remuneration policy of the Company is to ensure that the executive director and the senior key management 
team are rewarded competitively, having regard to the comparative marketplace in Ireland and the United Kingdom,

themselves for re-election at the Company's Annual General Meeting.
 None of the non-executive Directors hold a service agreement with the Company that provides for benefits upon 
termination.
 Executive Director
 The Chief Executive of the Company is the only executive director on the Board. Details of the remuneration paid 
to the Chief Executive are set out in Note 19(a) to the consolidated Financial Statements.
 The Company entered into an employment agreement with the Chief Executive on July 1, 2002 for a one year 
period to June 30, 2003. Thereafter, the agreement continues for successive annual periods but may be terminated 
with 12 months notice by either party. This employment agreement does not contain provisions providing for 
compensation on its termination.

 Statement of Directors' Responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report and the Financial Statements
 The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the consolidated and Company financial 
statements, in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
 Company law requires the directors to prepare consolidated and Company financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law, the directors are required to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and have elected to 
prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2009. In preparing the consolidated financial 
statements the directors have also elected to comply with IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB).
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -9-
 The consolidated and Company financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU, to 
present fairly the financial position of the Group and the Company and the performance of the Group. The 
Companies Acts, 1963 to 2009 provide in relation to such financial statements that references in the relevant part of 
these Acts to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
 In preparing each of the consolidated and Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
 -- select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 -- make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 -- state that the financial statements comply with IFRSs as adopted by the EU as applied in accordance with the 
Companies Acts, 1963 to 2009 and IFRSs as issued by the IASB; and
 -- prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the Company will continue in business.
 Under applicable law and the requirements of the Listing Rules issued by the Irish Stock Exchange, the directors 
are also responsible for preparing a Directors' Report and reports relating to directors' remuneration and corporate 
governance that comply with that law and those Rules. In particular, in accordance with the Transparency (Directive 
2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 (the Transparency Regulations), the directors are required to include in their report 
a fair review of the business and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group and 
Company and a responsibility statement relating to those and other matters, included below.
 The directors are responsible for keeping proper books of account that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Group and Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2009 and, as regards the consolidated financial statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
 The directors are responsible for the maintenance of integrity of the corporate and financial information included on 
the Company's website. Legislation in the Republic of Ireland governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
 Responsibility Statement, in accordance with the Transparency Regulations
 Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 94 and 95 of the Annual Report confirm that, 
to the best of their knowledge and belief:
 -- the consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group at March 31, 2011 and of its profit for the year 
then ended;
 -- the Company financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, as applied in 
accordance with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2009, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial 
position of the Company at March 31, 2011, and
 -- the Directors' Report contained in the Annual Report includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Group and Company, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

             RYANAIR SUES EUROPEAN COMMISSION (FOR THE FIFTH TIME)
                FOR ITS FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE ILLEGAL STATE AID
                         OF OVER EUR2 BILLION TO ALITALIA
Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today (Friday, 30th November
2007) lodged its fifth case in recent weeks in the European Court of First
Instance against the European Commission's repeated failure to investigate
illegal State aid to national flag carrier airlines. The previous four cases
include:
   State aid of over EUR1bn to Air France in the form of reduced domestic
     airport charges;
    State aid of over EUR100m to Lufthansa through its use of the loss-making
     Terminal 2 at Munich Airport;
    State aid of over EUR500m to the loss making Olympic Airways in Greece;
    State aid of over EUR20m to Alitalia's subsidiary, Volare, through a
     write-off in airport debts.
This latest (fifth) case involves the Commission's failure to act on Ryanair's
complaint about continuing illegal State aid to Alitalia. The aid consisted of
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Sues EC for 5th Time
several measures, including a split-up of the company's assets and operations
and uneven allocation of the debt, resulting in a EUR1.7 billion debt write-off
for Alitalia. Ryanair called on the Commission to investigate this blatant abuse
of EU competition rules over 2 years ago, but the Commission has so far failed
to do so.
Announcing the launch of these proceedings Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO, said:
        "The ongoing State aid to Alitalia is a perfect example of the
         Commission's bias towards inefficient national airlines. Alitalia is now
         losing in excess of EUR400 million per annum and the Italian government
         continues to illegally bail it out. Even dogs in the streets of Brussels
         know that Alitalia is receiving illegal State aid, yet DG TREN continues
         to ignore this blatant State aid, preferring instead to prosecute tiny
         regional airports like Pau in the south of France.
        "Following the Commission's failure to investigate this case, we are
         left with no alternative - yet again - but to challenge this further
         inaction in the European courts. We are calling on the Commission to end
         its discriminatory and biased approach to State aid enforcement, to
         start promoting competition and consumer choice, and to put an end to
         this scandal of unlawful State aid to flag carrier airlines".
        Ends.                             Friday, 30th November 2007

 Adjusted earnings per share have increased by 9.6% to 6.27 euro cent. 
 Balance Sheet 
 Cash and liquid resources have increased by EUR64.4m from EUR1,060.2m at March 31, 
 2003 to EUR1,124.7m at December 31, 2003, reflecting the increased cash flows from 
 the profitable trading performance during the period. Nine additional aircraft 
 were delivered in the period of which one was financed via an operating lease 
 and these, in addition to aircraft deposits, accounted for the bulk of the 
 EUR338.3m incurred in capital expenditure. This was part funded by the draw down 
 of long term debt, which increased, net of repayments, by EUR135.6m during the 
 period. Shareholders' funds at December 31, 2003 have increased to EUR1,457.9m, 
 compared to EUR1,241.7m at March 31, 2003. 
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis - Quarter Ended December 31, 2003 
 Profit after tax has increased by 10.2% to EUR47.5m driven by strong growth in 
 passenger volumes and continued tight cost control, offset by lower average 
 fares. Operating margins have declined by 2 points to 23.6% compared to the 
 previous period. Operating profit increased by 23.5% to EUR60.2m compared to the 
 quarter ended December 31, 2002 whilst profit before tax increased by 9.2%. 
 Total operating revenues increased by 37.2% to EUR255.0m whilst passenger volumes 
 increased by 54.4% to 6.1m. 
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 37.5% to EUR216.4m, reflecting the 
 increase in passenger volumes offset by lower average fares of 10.9%. The 
 decline in average fares is due to the launch of new routes and new bases 
 earlier in the year, the weakness of sterling to the euro (which accounted for 
 5% of the decline), and Ryanair's policy of offering the lowest airfares. 
 Ancillary revenues increased by 35.4% to EUR38.6m, which, excluding charters 
 ancillary revenues has actually increased by 45.4%. This reflects strong growth 
 in all areas of ancillary revenues particularly car hire, non-flight scheduled 
 revenues, hotels and internet related activities. These gains were partly offset 
 by the impact of the depreciation of the sterling currency against the euro in 
 this period due to the large volume of sterling denominated sales. 
 Total operating expenses increased by 42.0% to EUR194.9m due to the increased 
 level of activity, and the increased costs, primarily staff, depreciation, fuel, 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-
 route charges and airport & handling costs associated with the growth of the 
 airline. The weakness of sterling to euro had a positive impact on operating 
 costs as did the efficiencies arising from the increased proportion of 737-800 
 aircraft in operation. 
 Staff costs have increased by 35.2% to EUR29.5m reflecting a 34% increase in 
 average employee numbers to 2,356 and the impact of a 3% pay increase granted 
 during the period offset by savings arising from the stronger euro to sterling 
 exchange rate. 
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 31.5% to EUR25.0m due to an increase in 
 the average number of aircraft owned from 49 to 71, offset by savings arising 
 from the increase in the number of fully depreciated aircraft, lower 
 amortisation of capitalised maintenance costs primarily due to the retirement of 
 737-200 aircraft, and the lower euro denominated cost of new aircraft due to the 
 strengthening of the euro to US$ exchange rate. 
 Fuel costs increased by 46.9% to EUR43.1m due to a 61% increase in the number of 
 hours flown, a stronger euro to US$ exchange rate and an improvement in the 
 fleet fuel burn rate due to a higher proportion of 737-800 aircraft operated. 
 Maintenance costs increased by 41.9% to EUR8.8m reflecting an increase in the size 
 of the fleet operated, an increase in the number of flight hours, and the 
 increase in maintenance provisions relating to the leased "Buzz" aircraft, 
 offset by maintenance savings due to improved reliability arising from the 
 higher proportion of 737-800 aircraft operated as a percentage of the total 
 fleet. 
 Marketing and distribution costs decreased by 63.5% to EUR1.0m due to a lower 
 spend in the quarter on new routes as most new routes were launched in Quarter 
 1. In addition advertising spend is more focussed on new markets with existing 
 market spend declining as the company promotes its fares directly to the 
 customer via its internet site. 
 Aircraft rental costs of EUR2.7m arose during the period reflecting the lease 
 rental costs associated with the acquired "Buzz" aircraft. The charge also 
 includes one month rental relating to the first aircraft delivered to Ryanair 
 under the new operating lease agreement signed during the quarter. 
 Route Charges increased by 72.1% to EUR27.4m due to an increase in the number of 
 sectors flown, an increase in the average sector length and an increase in the 
 size of the aircraft operated which incur a higher charge offset by the impact 
 of a weaker sterling to euro exchange rate. 
 Airport and handling charges increased by 45.4% to EUR38.1m which is less than the 
 growth in passenger volumes and reflects the lower charges on our new European 
 routes and at our new bases. 
 Other expenses increased by 21.0% to EUR19.1m which is less than the growth in 
 ancillary revenues and reflects improved margins on some new and existing 
 products and continued cost control on other indirect costs. 
 Operating profits have increased by 23.5% to EUR60.1m due to the reasons outlined 
 above. 
 Interest receivable decreased by EUR3.1m to EUR5.1m reflecting the lower interest 
 rates obtained on cash deposits during the quarter. Interest payable increased 
 by EUR4.4m to EUR12.5m due to the increased level of debt arising from the 
 acquisition of new aircraft. 
 Taxation is 10.2% of pre-tax profits and amounted to EUR4.6m during the period. 
 The Company's balance sheet continues to benefit from the strong growth in 
 profits. Tangible fixed assets increased to EUR1,611.1m from EUR1,352.4m principally 
 as a result of the purchase of eight new 737-800 additional aircraft since March 
 31, 2003 and the payment of deposits for new deliveries. The Company generated 
 cash from operating activities of EUR295.5m, which funded advance payments on 
 future deliveries of EUR149.9m whilst the balance is reflected in the higher cash 
 and liquid resources figure of EUR1,124.7m. Advance delivery deposits amounted to 
 EUR396.5m at the period end. Total debt has increased by a further EUR135.6m, net of 
 repayments, since March 31, 2003 to EUR972.8m. Shareholder's funds at December 31, 
 2003 have increased to EUR1,457.9m compared to EUR1,241.7m at March 31, 2003. 
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis - Nine months ended December 31, 2003 
 Profit after tax has increased by 14.9% to EUR223.1m driven by strong growth in 
 passenger volumes at lower average fares and continued tight cost control. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-
 Operating margins declined 2.3 points to 30.9% whilst net margins declined by 
 3.6 points to 26.2% compared to the previous period. 
 Total operating revenues increased by 30.9% to EUR851.4m whilst passenger volumes 
 increased by 48% to 17.4m. 
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 30.2% to EUR740.0m primarily due to 
 increased passenger numbers on new and existing routes, offset by a 12.0% 
 decline in average fares. The decline in average fares is due to the launch of 
 new routes and new bases, the weakness of sterling to the euro (which accounted 
 for 5% of the decline), and Ryanair's policy of offering the lowest airfares. 
 Ancillary revenues increased by 35.9% to EUR111.4m, which is lower than the growth 
 in passenger volumes, and reflects the cessation of the charter programme as 
 Ryanair replaced Charter capacity with scheduled services, and also the weakness 
 of sterling to the euro due to ancillaries being predominantly sold in sterling. 
 Excluding charters ancillary revenues increased by 56% due mainly to strong car 
 hire revenues, non-flight scheduled revenues and other ancillary product 
 revenues. 
 Total operating expenses increased by 35.4% to EUR587.9m due to the increased 
 level of activity, and the increased costs primarily staff, depreciation, fuel, 
 route charges and airport & handling costs associated with the growth of the 
 airline. 
 Staff costs have increased by 32.7% to EUR91.0m. This increase reflects a 34% 
 increase in average employee numbers to 2,273, and the impact of a 3% pay 
 increase granted during the period offset by savings arising from the strength 
 of the euro exchange rate to sterling. 
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 26.1% to EUR71.7m(excluding additional 
 depreciation charges on retired aircraft) due to an increase in the average 
 number of aircraft owned from 49 to 71 offset by lower amortisation on 
 capitalised maintenance costs due to the retirement of 737-200 aircraft, and 
 savings due to the increase in the number of aircraft fully depreciated. 
 Fuel costs increased by 30.4% to EUR127.5m due to a 58% increase in the number of 
 hours flown, offset by a decrease in the average US$ cost per gallon, an 
 improvement in the fuel burn rate due to a higher proportion of 737-800 aircraft 
 operated, and the positive impact of the strengthening of the euro to the US$. 
 Maintenance costs increased by 32.7% to EUR31.0m reflecting an increase in the 
 size of the fleet operated, higher maintenance due to the acquisition of the 
 "Buzz" aircraft and an increase in the number of flight hours, offset by savings 
 due to improved reliability arising from the higher proportion of 737-800 
 aircraft operated as a percentage of the total fleet. 
 Marketing and distribution costs amounted to EUR11.0m in line with the previous 
 period reflecting a lower level of expenditure on existing routes and markets, 
 which were promoted via fare offerings on the internet offset by increased 
 expenditure on advertising and promotion of new routes/bases. 
 Aircraft rental costs of EUR6.5m arose during the period reflecting the lease 
 rental costs associated with the leased "Buzz" aircraft and one month's rental 
 for the first aircraft delivered under the new operating lease agreement. 
 Route charges increased by 61.7% to EUR80.3m due to an increase in the number of

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Operating and Financial Overview
 Summary half-year ended September 30, 2012
 Profit after tax increased by 10% to EUR595.6m compared to EUR543.5m in the half-year ended September 30, 
2011 primarily due to a 6% increase in average fares and strong ancillary revenues, offset by a 24% increase in fuel 
costs.  Total operating revenues increased by 15% to EUR3,106.1m as average fares rose by 6%.  Ancillary 
revenues grew by 20%, faster than the 7% increase in passenger numbers, to EUR583.8m due to a combination of 
an improved product mix and the roll out of reserved seating across the network.  Total revenue per passenger, as 
a result, increased by 7% whilst Load Factor decreased by 1 point to 84% during the period compared to the period 
ended September 30, 2011.
 Total operating expenses increased by 16% to EUR2,393.4m, primarily due to an increase in fuel prices, the higher 
level of activity, the strength of sterling to the euro and operating costs associated with the growth of the airline.  
Fuel, which represents 47% of total operating costs compared to 44% in the comparative period, increased by 24% 
to EUR1,124.9m due to the higher price per gallon paid and a 6% increase in the number of hours flown.  Unit costs 
excluding fuel increased by 2%, including fuel unit costs rose by 8%.  Operating margin decreased by 1 point to 
23% whilst operating profit increased by 10% to EUR712.7m.
 Net margin was down 1 point to 19%, compared to September 30, 2011.
 Basic earnings per share for the period were 41.34 euro cent compared to basic earnings per share of 36.62 euro 
cent at September 30, 2011.
 Balance sheet
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -5-
 Gross cash increased by EUR417.1m since March 31, 2012 to EUR3,932.7m and Gross debt increased by 
EUR58.0m to EUR3,683.2m.  As a result we have moved from Net debt of EUR109.6m at March 31, 2012 to Net 
cash of EUR249.5m at September 30, 2012. The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR607.4m 
which funded net capital expenditure of EUR179.1m, debt repayments, and a EUR67.5m share buy-back 
programme.
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis for the half-year ended September 30, 2012
 Profit after tax increased by 10% to EUR595.6m primarily due to a 6% increase in average fares and strong 
ancillary revenues offset by a 24% rise in fuel costs.  Total operating revenues increased by 15% to EUR3,106.1m 
primarily due to a 6% increase in average fares, a 7% rise in passenger numbers and strong ancillary revenue. 
Fuel, which represents 47% of total operating costs, compared to 44% in the prior year, increased by 24% to 
EUR1,124.9m due to a higher price per gallon paid and a 6% increase in the number of hours flown.  Unit costs 
excluding fuel rose by 2%, including fuel unit costs rose by 8%.  Operating margin, as a result of the above, 
decreased by 1 point to 23% whilst operating profit increased by 10% to EUR712.7m.
 Total operating revenues increased by 15% to EUR3,106.1m primarily due to a 6% rise in average fares which was 
partially impacted by the strength of sterling to the euro, a 7% increase in passenger numbers to 48.0m and strong 
ancillary revenues.
 Total revenue per passenger rose by 7%, primarily due to a 6% increase in average fare and strong growth in 
ancillary revenues.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 13% to EUR2,522.3m due to a 7% increase in passengers and a 6% 
rise in average fares, and was partially assisted by the strength of sterling to the euro.  Load factor decreased by 1 
point to 84%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 20% to EUR583.8m, faster than the 7% increase in passenger volume, due to a 
combination of an improved product mix, the network roll out of reserved seating, and higher internet related 
revenues.
 Total operating expenses increased by 16% to EUR2,393.4m due to the 24% rise in fuel costs, increased costs 
associated with the growth of the airline, and the negative impact of the strength of sterling to the euro.
 Staff costs increased by 8% to EUR240.0m due to a 6% increase in flight hours and a 2% pay increase for flight 
crew granted in April 2012.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 9% to EUR169.9m due to a combination of the increased level of 
activity and a higher number of 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this period (September 30, 2012: 243) compared to the 
half-year ended September 30, 2011 (221).
 Fuel & oil costs increased by 24% to EUR1,124.9m due to higher fuel prices and the increased number of hours 
flown.
 Maintenance costs increased by 17% to EUR57.7m, due to the higher level of activity, line maintenance costs 
arising from the launch of new bases, and handback provisions for leased aircraft.
 Aircraft rental costs increased by 9% to EUR47.6m, due to a net increase in the number of average leased aircraft 
in the fleet from 52 to 55 and the negative impact of higher lessor financing costs for 8 new leased aircraft.  We 
handed back 4 aircraft in the half-year due to the maturity of leases.
 Route charges rose by 5% to EUR285.2m due to the increased number of sectors flown, offset by a slightly shorter 
sector length.
 Airport & handling charges increased by 12% to EUR353.0m, due to the 8% increase in sectors flown, increased 
charges in Spain, a quadrupling of ATC charges in Italy, the mix of new routes and bases launched, and the 
strength of sterling to the euro.
 Marketing, distribution & other costs increased by EUR19.1m to EUR115.1m, reflecting higher marketing spend per 
passenger due to the launch of 6 new bases and new routes compared to the period ending September 30, 2011. 
Ancillary costs rose due to the increased level of sales.
 Operating margin decreased by 1 point due to the reasons outlined above and operating profits have increased by 
10% to EUR712.7m.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -5-
 Finance income decreased by 11% to EUR19.5m primarily due to the decline in interest rates, particularly for 
deposits placed with highly rated financial institutions, which resulted in lower yields.

 2.       Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in 
applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as 
those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.        Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.          Income tax expense
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -5-
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 
was 12.2% (June 30, 2011: 11.0%).  The tax charge for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 of EUR13.7m (June 
30, 2011: EUR17.3m) comprises a deferred tax charge relating to the temporary differences for property, 
plant and equipment recognised in the income statement and the utilisation of previous trading losses.
 5.           Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements.  The charge of EUR0.5m is the fair value of various share options 
granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in accordance with 
employee services rendered.
 6.            Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.            Capital commitments
 At June 30, 2012 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 294 (2011: 272) Boeing 737-800 aircraft and had firm 
orders for an additional 11 Boeing 737-800's. The delivery of these firm order aircraft will increase the 
fleet size (net of lease hand-backs) to 305 aircraft by March 31, 2013.
 8.             Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR149.7m at March 31, 2012 to EUR160.8m at 
June 30, 2012 is comprised of a gain of EUR11.1m, recognised through other comprehensive income, 
reflecting the increase in the Aer Lingus share price from EUR0.94 per share at March 31, 2012 to EUR1.01 
per share at June 30, 2012.
 9.           Analysis of operating segment
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car hire, internet income and related sales to third parties.   The Company 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource 
allocation decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation 
decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, 
which are uniform in type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise 
consolidated financial results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated profit/(loss) after tax of 
the Company for the period.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed 
across the Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment 
operations.  In addition, as the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and 
liabilities have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:                               Quarter

 12.     Share buy-back
 On March 29, 2012, the Company agreed to buy back 15.0m ordinary shares at a cost of EUR67.5m.  This 
trade settled in early April 2012.  This is equivalent to approximately 1.0% of the Company's issued share 
capital. All ordinary shares repurchased have been cancelled.  Accordingly, share capital decreased by 
15.0m ordinary shares with a nominal value of EUR0.1m and the capital redemption reserve increased by a 
corresponding EUR0.1m. The capital redemption reserve is required to be created under Irish law to 
preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
 13.     Related party transactions
 We have related party relationships with our subsidiaries, directors and senior key management personnel. 
All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
 There were no related party transactions in the quarter ended June 30, 2012 that materially affected the 
financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no changes in the 
related party transactions described in the 2011 Annual Report that could have a material effect on the 
financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.

Aer Lingus Group PLC
11 September 2007
                            Ryanair appeal will fail
Statement on behalf of Aer Lingus
10 September 2007
In June of this year, following an exhaustive investigation, the EU Commission
concluded that the proposed Ryanair takeover of Aer Lingus presented greater
monopoly problems than any other airline case ever examined by the Commission.
The Commission's investigation, which took account of the interests of all
relevant parties, particularly those of consumers, confirmed the position of Aer
Lingus that competition and, as a result the Irish travelling public, would
suffer if a merger of the two largest airlines operating out of Dublin airport
was permitted to take place.
Consequently, Aer Lingus is in no doubt that the appeal announced today will
fail, and Aer Lingus will assist the Commission in upholding the decision before
Aer Lingus Group PLC Statement on Ryanair Appeal
the Court.
                                      ends
Notes to editor:
   Ryanair's assertion that the decision flies in the face of the
     Commission's previously expressed desire for consolidation in the European
     airline industry disregards the fact that the Commission has never favoured
     consolidation which leads to one airline dominating its home market in the
     way that Ryanair would dominate the Irish market were it to control Aer
     Lingus.
   Ryanair's position also ignores the practical reality that Irish consumers
     do not have the option of rail and road travel out of this country when
     travelling to mainland Europe.
   In contesting the Commission's position, Ryanair makes a false and
     misleading comparison between this case, which involved the proposed merger
     of two low cost carriers operating out of the same base, and the
     Commission's approval of the airline mergers such as the merger between Air
     France and KLM.  For instance:
      The number of passengers travelling annually on the routes where
        Ryanair and Aer Lingus overlap is 14 million, while in Air France/KLM
        the number was only 4 million.
      A merged Ryanair/Aer Lingus would cover 80% of all passengers at
        Dublin Airport, while Air France/KLM had only 62% at Paris CDG and 60% at
        Amsterdam Schiphol.
   Ryanair's argument that this merger only affects 5% of air transport in
     the EU is plainly misleading.  The European Commission protects competition
     on a route-by-route basis and a combined Ryanair/Aer Lingus entity would
     have dominated every single route operated by both Aer Lingus and Ryanair.

 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.            Capital commitments
 At December 31, 2016 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 365 (2015: 320) Boeing 737 aircraft.  The Group 
agreed to purchase 183 new Boeing 737-800NG aircraft from the Boeing Corporation during the periods Fiscal 
2015 to Fiscal 2019 of which 11 aircraft were delivered in the year ended March 31, 2015, a further 41 
were delivered in the year ended March 31, 2016 and 31 in the nine months ended December 31, 2016.
 The Group also agreed to purchase up to 200 (100 firm and 100 options) Boeing 737 Max 200 aircraft from 
the Boeing Corporation during the periods Fiscal 2020 to Fiscal 2024.
 8.            Analysis of operating segment
 The Group is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car-hire, internet income and related sales to third parties. The Group 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided 
to the CEO, who is the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource allocation 
decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data. However, resource allocation decisions are made 
based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in 
type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial 
results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the adjusted profit/(loss) after tax of the 
Group for the period.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Group has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Group's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed 
across the Group's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment 
operations.  In addition, as the Group is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and 
liabilities have been allocated to the Group's single reportable segment.

 Acquisitions and disposals
 Capital expenditure in the nine months to December 31, 2016 amounted to EUR984.5M and primarily relates 
to aircraft pre delivery payments and 31 aircraft deliveries.
 11.          Financial instruments and financial risk management
 The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 These interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2016 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the period.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --           Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
that the Group can access at the measurement date.
 --           Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
that asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --           Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

 Fair value estimation
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
 11.          Financial instruments and financial risk management (continued)
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --           Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to determine 
the fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
 --           Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and carbon swaps: A comparison of 
the contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at March 31, 2016 
has been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the nine months to December 31, 2016, 
there were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 Financial instruments disclosed at fair value
 --           Fixed-rate long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been 
discounted at the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at December 31, 
2016 to arrive at a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
 There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the nine months to 
December 31, 2016 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.

Ryanair Holdings PLC
17 May 2005
                  RYANAIR AWARDS 3% PAY INCREASE TO EMPLOYEES
                ONE OF THE HIGHEST PAY EU AIRLINES JUST GOT BETTER
Ryanair today (Tuesday, 17th May 2005) confirmed that following a round of
direct negotiations with its staff in the month of April, it had implemented a
3% pay increase backdated to 1st April 2005.
This 3% increase will apply to all staff groups across Europe who participated
in the direct negotiations with the Company. Only the Dublin based pilots chose
not to negotiate directly with the Company and as a result they have not at this
time enjoyed a pay increase, however the door remains open to this group should
they choose to avail of it. All of Ryanair's other people will benefit.
Ryanair's Director of Personnel, Eddie Wilson said:
        "This salary increase is a reward for the productivity and the
         dedication of our people who continue to work hard to make Ryanair
         Europe's No 1 low fares airline. While traffic growth remains strong,
         higher oil prices mean that cost control remains vital.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RY awards 3% pay increase
        "Despite high oil prices and over capacity in many European markets,
         Ryanair will again be one of the few airlines in Europe to award salary
         increases and secure careers for our people. This pay increase
         reinforces the strength of Ryanair's model whereby people negotiate
         directly with the Company and as a result enjoy better pay and
         conditions than our low pay unionised competitors".

                  Management Discussion and Analysis of Results
                  ---------------------------------------------
                                  Introduction
For the purposes of the MD&A all figures and comments are by reference to the
adjusted income statement excluding exceptional items referred to below.
Exceptional items for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 consist of a
receipt of EUR5.2m (net of tax) in quarter 1 arising from the settlement of an
insurance claim for the scribing of 6 Boeing 737-200 aircraft.
Following the adoption of IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) the
Company was obliged to change its accounting treatment for Business
acquisitions. This has resulted in a one-off, non-cash release of EUR11.9m in the
quarter ended December 31, 2004 (see note 5).
Profit after tax and adjusted profit after tax increased by 6% to EUR36.8m during
the quarter compared to last year. The adjusted profit for the nine months ended
December 31, 2005, excluding exceptional items, increased by 16% to EUR273.8m.
The results for the period and comparative year have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standard ("IFRS") accounting policies
expected to be adopted in the annual financial statements for the year ended 31
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results -4-
March 2006, and a detailed explanation of the financial impact of the adoption
of these policies was set out in a separate document issued with the quarterly
financial results for the period to 30 June 2005.
Summary Quarter ended December 31, 2005
=--------------------------------------
Profit after tax increased by 6% to EUR36.8m, compared to EUR34.8m in the previous
quarter ended December 31, 2004. These results were achieved by strong growth in
passenger volumes and continued tight cost control, excluding fuel, which was
significantly higher than in the comparative period. Total operating revenues
increased by 27% to EUR370.7m, which is greater than the 26% growth in passenger
volumes, as average fares were almost flat and ancillary revenues grew by 31% to
EUR59.0m. Total revenue per passenger as a result increased by 1% whilst Passenger
Load Factor decreased by 1 point to 83% during the period.
Total operating expenses increased by 32% to EUR321.5m, due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs, primarily fuel, route charges, maintenance
costs, and airport & handling costs associated with the growth of the airline.
Fuel, which represents 36% of total operating costs compared to 30% last year,
increased by 59% to EUR114.9m due to substantial increases in the US$ cost per
gallon, partially offset by the strengthening of the Euro to US$ exchange rate.
Unit costs excluding fuel declined by 6% as all other major cost items increased
at a slower rate than the growth in passenger volumes. This is despite the
impact on last year's comparative figures of the release of maintenance
provisions of EUR5.2m arising from the return of 6 leased Boeing 737-300's to the
lessor. Due to the significantly higher fuel costs operating margins declined by
4 points to 13%, whilst operating profit increased by 2% to EUR49.2m.
Profit before tax has increased by 5%, higher than the growth in operating
profit due to the slower rate of growth in net interest charges and a gain
arising from the sale of the remaining 737-200 aircraft.

Balance Sheet
=------------
Total Cash increased by EUR169.5m to EUR1,775.2m since March 31, 2005 but represents
a decline in the quarter of EUR33.5m due to funding an additional EUR183.9m in
capital expenditure from internal resources. Gross capital expenditure in the
period amounted to EUR304.1m as the company took delivery of 12 Boeing 737-800
aircraft and funded additional aircraft deposits during the period. Capital
expenditure was part funded by the drawdown of long term debt, Total debt net of
repayments increased during the period by 120.1m. The exercise of share options
during the period, mainly granted to pilots contributed a further EUR28.9m in cash
during the period. Shareholders' Funds at Dec 31, 2005 have increased by EUR216.0m
to EUR1,950.5m, compared to March 31, 2005 reflecting the EUR279.0m increase in
profitability during the period offset by a reduction of EUR91.9m resulting from
changes in the accounting treatment for derivative financial instruments,
pensions and stock options following the adoption of IFRS.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis quarter year ended Dec 31, 2005
=---------------------------------------------------------------
Profit after tax, increased by 6% to EUR36.8m due to a 1% increase in average
revenue per passenger, and tight cost control which was offset by fuel costs
increasing by 59% to EUR114.9m during the period. Operating margins, declined by 4
points due to higher fuel costs and lower than normal maintenance charges in
quarter 3 last year due to the release of EUR5.2m of maintenance provisions.
Operating profit increased by 2% to EUR49.2m compared to quarter year ended Dec
31, 2004.
Total operating revenues increased by 27% to EUR370.7m due to the combination of a
26% increase in passengers carried and a 1% improvement in average revenue per
passenger.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 26% to EUR311.7m due to a 1% improvement
in average fares, increased passenger volumes on existing routes, and the
successful launch of new routes and new bases at Liverpool, Luton and Pisa. Load

factor decreased by 1 point to 83% during the period.
Ancillary revenues continue to perform strongly as revenues grew by 31% to
EUR59.0m in the period. This performance reflects the strong growth in on board
sales, non-flight scheduled revenues, and internet income. Ancillary revenues
continue to grow at a faster rate than passenger volumes and now account for 16%
of total revenues compared to 15% last year.
Total operating expenses increased by 32% to EUR321.5m due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs primarily fuel, maintenance costs, aircraft
rentals, route charges and airport and handling costs associated with the growth
of the airline. The comparative maintenance costs for quarter ended December 31,
2004 were positively impacted by the release of maintenance provisions of EUR5.2m
arising from the return of 6 leased 737-300 aircraft.
Total operating costs were also adversely impacted by a 10% increase in the
average sector length, whilst higher US$ fuel prices were partly offset by the
strength of the Euro exchange rate against the US dollar.
Staff costs have increased by 17% to EUR41.1m. This increase primarily reflects an
increase in average employed and the impact of pay increases of 3% granted
during the period.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 10% to EUR28.7m. There are an

 Given Aer Lingus' improved operating performance in 2014 compared to 2013, the Board has agreed to 
recommend to shareholders that this increased profitability should be translated into a return of value to 
shareholders in the form of an increase in the annual dividend from four cent per share (paid in respect of 2013) to 
five cent per share (payable in respect of 2014). This proposed dividend of five cent per share will be payable to 
shareholders regardless of whether the proposed IAG offer proceeds. In the event that the IAG offer does proceed, 
the proposed dividend will equate to the cash dividend of five cent per share which is part of the IAG offer.
 In December 2012, the Group entered into an agreement for the assignment of its interest in the lease of a hangar 
facility at Shannon Airport. Under the terms of this arrangement, Aer Lingus has provided a guarantee to Dublin 
Airport Authority in respect of rents that would otherwise have been payable by the Group under the lease up to 31 
July 2021. The Group estimates the maximum amount payable would be approximately EUR3.1 million in the event 
that the guarantee was called. In previous years, the Group had disclosed this guarantee as a contingent liability. In 
January 2015, Transaero entered into examinership and there is a likelihood that the Shannon Group will enforce 
the guarantee. As this provided evidence that the conditions existed at the balance sheet date, management 
determined that the remaining lease obligations guaranteed by Aer Lingus are an 'onerous lease' requiring 
recognition of a provision. Management will endeavour to mitigate this risk depending on the outcome of the 
Transaero examinership process.
 On 5 February 2015, the European General Court annulled the EC's decision regarding air travel tax in so far as it 
ordered the recovery of the aid from the beneficiaries for an amount set at EUR8 per passenger.  Refer to Note 24 
for more detail on this development.
 The UK Court of Appeal rejected Ryanair's appeal on 12 February 2015. The Court also refused permission for 
Ryanair to appeal to the Supreme Court. Ryanair has stated that it intends to apply to the Supreme Court for 
permission to appeal.  It is not currently known when this request will be considered by the Supreme Court or 
whether the Supreme Court will grant such permission to appeal.
 On the 16 February 2015, Mr. Stephen Kavanagh's appointment as Chief Executive Officer of Aer Lingus Group 
plc with effect from 1 March 2015 was announced.
Aer Lingus Group PLC 2014 Preliminary Results -21-
 As noted in Note 20, 28% of waivers have been received as at 19 February 2015. Therefore, the EUR190.7 million 
one off contribution (as discussed in Note 23 and Note 8 (d)) has reduced by approximately EUR54.2 million and 
the post retirement income streaming pension obligation (as discussed in Note 21 and Note 8 (e)) has reduced by 
approximately EUR4.5 million at 19 February 2015.
 There have been no other significant events occurring after the reporting period, up to and including the date of 
approval of the financial information within this preliminary announcement by the Board of Directors.

 ===============  ===========
13.     Share buy-back
 In the year ended March 31, 2014 the Company bought back 69.5m ordinary shares at a total cost of 
EUR481.7m. This is equivalent to approximately 4.8% of the Company's issued share capital at March 31, 
2013.  All ordinary shares repurchased were cancelled. Accordingly, share capital decreased by 69.5m 
ordinary shares with a nominal value of EUR0.4m and the capital redemption reserve increased by a 
corresponding EUR0.4m.  The capital redemption reserve is required to be created under Irish law to 
preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
 On June 20, 2013 the Company detailed plans to return up to EUR1.0 billion to shareholders over the 
following two years. At March 31, 2014 EUR481.7m has been completed via share buybacks and the balance (in 
either special dividends or share buybacks) is to be completed in the fiscal year to March 31, 2015 
(subject to profitability and shareholder approval at the AGM).
 14.     Related party transactions
 We have related party relationships with our subsidiaries, directors and senior key management personnel. 
All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
 There were no related party transactions in the year ended March 31, 2014 that materially affected the 
financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no changes in the 
related party transactions described in the 2013 Annual Report that could have a material effect on the 
financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.
 15.     Post balance sheet events
 On April 30, 2014, the Company agreed to purchase a further 5 Boeing 737 800NG for delivery in fiscal 
2016, bringing the total number of aircraft to be purchased from Boeing to 180 for delivery between fiscal 
2015 and 2019.

              RYANAIR CONDEMNS EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S LATEST ABUSE
                              OF THE STATE AID RULES
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Wednesday, 28th November
2007) criticised the EU Commission for its ongoing bias in the enforcement of
the state aid rules and for continuing to bring baseless cases against tiny
regional airports like Pau and Tampere while failing to take any action on the
numerous state aid cases against flag carrier airlines brought by Ryanair.
Ryanair has filed complaints regarding over EUR1 billion in illegal state aid
provided by the French Government to Air France (in the form of discounted
domestic fees); hundreds of millions in subsidies to Lufthansa (below market
airport charges and exclusive use of the new terminal in Munich); and blatant
ongoing state aid by the Italian and Greek Governments who continue to bail out
their terminally ill national airlines.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYR CONDEMNS COMMISSION
Meanwhile, the mighty EU Commission continues to take completely spurious
actions against tiny regional and secondary airports such as Pau, Tampere,
Luebeck and Alghero, who are trying to develop traffic and provide competition
and choice to European consumers. These investigations are based on spurious
complaints by flag carrier airlines trying to block competition and undermine
the growth of these small airports. The complaint in Pau is a complete nonsense
and is further evidence that the Commission (DG TREN) operates a discriminatory
system by ignoring billions of illegal state aid to the flag carrier airlines,
while launching ridiculous state aid investigations to undermine competition at
tiny regional airports.
Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan, said:
        "This is further proof that the EU Commission (DG TREN) operates one
         rule for the flag carrier airlines and their National Governments, who
         continue to provide massive amounts of illegal state aid to them, and a
         completely different rule for tiny airports like Pau who are bringing
         low fares competition and choice to European consumers and are
         developing traffic and new routes to destinations around Europe, which
         were formerly denied to them by Air France and others.
        "The politically corrupt way in which the Commission applies these the
         state aid rules is demonstrated by their legally flawed decision in the
         Charleroi case, an airport that has experienced phenomenal growth in the
         past three years (since the decision) and the airport is about to open a
         brand new terminal. Ryanair has been pushing to get a hearing in the
         European courts to have this decision overturned but the Commission is
         delaying this hearing.
        "We will continue to fight these ongoing abuses by the Commission of its
         state aid rules and its corrupt failure to investigate the real culprits
         - the flag carriers - who continue to be massively supported and
         subsidised by their national Governments".

 Ryanair's SEPTEMBER SALES SOar
 20% INCREASE IN SEPTEMBER PASSENGER NUMBERS
WILL BANKERS BE NEXT TO TURN TO RYANAIR?
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fare airline today (Friday, 3rd October 2008)
 announced that 5.23 million passengers travelled with them in September, a 20%
 increase over September 2007.  Ryanair carried just over 56 million passengers
 in the year to September 2007.
Ryanair's continued growth underlines that passengers will no longer tolerate
 the high fares and fuel surcharges imposed by flag carrier airlines, such as Air
 France, British Airways, Lufthansa and Aer Lingus. Ryanair believes that these
 airlines face a bleak winter and a continuing exodus of passengers to Ryanair's
 guaranteed lowest fares.
The following are Ryanair's passenger and load factor statistics for September
 2008.

1.  Represents the number of booked seats flown by Ryanair.
 2.  Represents the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats
 available to passengers.
Stephen McNamara, Head of Communications, said:
"Having achieved record passenger numbers throughout the summer we showed no
 sign of slowdown in September with 5.23million passengers taking advantage of
 Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares and no fuel surcharge.
A lot of price sensitive leisure passengers have switched from rival, high fares
 airlines, to Ryanair. However, in light of the current crisis in banking and
 financial institutions we are confident that we will soon seen more bankers
 migrate to Ryanair also.  Tougher economic times will see these bankers tighten
 the purse strings and save time and money by taking advantage of our guaranteed
 lowest fares and our unrivalled punctuality".

 Supply remains finite from both the occupiers' and the investors' points of view.  The planning 
environment is becoming even more restrictive including the proposal to bring the construction of 
mezzanine floors under planning control.
 Meanwhile, occupational demand continues to grow.  As a result rents have shown strong growth and are 
forecast to continue to do so.  These factors have all combined to produce a very competitive investment 
market.
 A notable trend has been the increased demand from investors for older schemes benefiting from relatively 
open A1 planning consents.  These can be refurbished, established tenants relocated, and new fashion or 
other high street tenants substituted, often producing dramatic uplift in rents.
 Out of town food stores have also continued to see good rental growth; particularly from favourable rent 
review settlements.  Accordingly, investors are prepared to accept low initial yields, even for shorter 
income streams, as there is ample evidence that traders are willing to renew or extend leases in good 
trading locations.
 Shopping Centres and High Street Retail
 Retailers continue to experience mixed fortunes.  Although there are few signs of consumers reducing 
their expenditure, retailer margins remain under pressure.
 However yields have sharpened, reflecting the strength of demand for property and, in the case of 
centres, the scope for enhancing returns through asset management.
 As with all sectors, yield compression has occurred such that the difference between prime and secondary 
or even tertiary schemes has narrowed.  Consequently, some investors who purchased one or two years ago 
are now realising profits.

 RYANAIR WELCOMES BA AND IBERIA'S WHITE FLAG
Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, today (13th Nov 09) welcomed the
 inevitable merger of British Airways and Iberia - two of Europe's high fares,
 fuel surcharging airlines.  This merger is the latest in a long line of European
 high fares airlines merging because they can't compete with Ryanair's lowest
 fares and no fuel surcharge flights.
In recent years Lufthansa has taken control of Swiss, Austrian, SN Brussels and
 BMI while Air France has bought KLM and Alitalia.  Ryanair believes that all of
 these mergers will lead to higher fares and even more fuel surcharges from these
 flag carriers.
Today's announcement bears out Ryanair's forecast that there will be just four
 large EU airlines - BA, Air France, Lufthansa and Ryanair, and of these four
 only Ryanair is committed to low fares and no fuel surcharges.  The combined
 BA / Iberia will carry approximately 60m pax pa with traffic declining by 4%
 /10% currently while Ryanair will still be bigger carrying over 66m pax this
 year as we grow by 15% p.a.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Welcomes BA and Iberia 's White Flag
"Flag carrier airlines throughout Europe are raising the white flag because they
 can't compete with Ryanair's rapid growth, low fares and no fuel surcharge
 guarantee.  Consolidation is the only option for these high fares airlines as
 more and more passengers switch to Ryanair's low fares.  The merger of BA and
 Iberia is like two drunks trying to prop each other up; both have reported large
 losses, both are facing a winter of industrial action and both charge high fares
 and fuel surcharges as their passengers switch to Ryanair's low fare services in
 the UK and Spain.
"Since consolidation of Europe's high fares airlines has never led to lower
 fares, this merger will be great for Ryanair's growth and we look forward to
 welcoming many more millions of BA's and Iberia's passengers as they switch to
 Ryanair's low fares flights".

  RYANAIR SUES EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOR ITS FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE EUR1BILLION OF
                             STATE AID TO AIR FRANCE
Ryanair, Europe's favourite low fares airline, today, (Thursday, 8th November
2007), (exactly 18 months after its original complaint), lodged a case in the
European Court of First Instance against the European Commission's failure to
act on Ryanair's complaint about EUR1 billion worth of State to Air France in the
form of unlawful reduced domestic airport charges in France. Ryanair has called
on the Commission several times to investigate this obvious abuse of EU
competition rules, but the Commission has repeatedly failed to do so.
Announcing the launch of these proceedings Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO, said:
        "This is just another example of the Commission's uneven-handed
         application of the State aid rules. They apply one rule to flag carriers
         by ignoring blatant State aid to Air France, Alitalia, Olympic,
         Lufthansa among others, while at the same time wasting time and money
         investigating baseless complaints from flag carrier airlines against
         open market commercial deals at regional and secondary airports. Recent
         examples of this include investigations at Tampere airport in Finland
Ryanair Holdings PLC Statement re: Sues EU Comm...
         and Alghero airport in Sardinia. These complaints were filed by flag
         carrier airlines operating at expensive hub airports, who would never
         fly to smaller airports and are only trying to prevent competition and
         consumer choice.
        "On the other hand, the Commission refuses to act on legitimate
         complaints against serious violations of the State aid rules by National
         Governments to protect their flag carrier airlines. The French
         Government's operation of massively discounted domestic airport fees in
         France - almost all of which supports Air France - amounts to
         approximately EUR1bn of illegal State aid to the benefit of Air France,
         yet the Commission has refused to do anything about this for the last 18
         months! The Commission has previously outlawed differentiated domestic/
         intra EU airport charges in Finland, Portugal, the UK and Ireland, so
         why should France be any different?
        "It appears that the Commission applies different rules for the high
         fare flag carrier airlines compared to low fares airlines. We are
         calling on the Commission to start promoting competition and stop
         protecting flag carrier airlines who continue to receive unlawful State
         aid."

7.         To consider and if thought fit pass the following Resolution as a

 Section 155 of the Companies Act, 1963) of the Company be and they are hereby
 generally authorised to make market purchases (as defined by section 212 of the
 Companies Act, 1990) of the Company's Ordinary Shares on such terms and

 Directors of such subsidiary, may from time to time determine in accordance with
 and subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, 1990 and the following
 restrictions and provisions:
7.1  The maximum aggregate number of Ordinary Shares authorised to be acquired
 pursuant to this resolution shall not exceed 74.2m Ordinary Shares;
7.2  The minimum price which may be paid for any such share shall be an amount
 equal to the nominal value thereof;
7.3  The maximum price which may be paid for any such share shall be an amount
 equal to the higher of:

7.4 For the purpose of 7.3.1, "Relevant Price" means, in respect of any business
 day on which there shall be a dealing on the Irish Stock Exchange (or any
 successor thereto) in respect of such shares, the last price of such share as
 published in the Irish Stock Exchange Daily Official List (or any successor
 publication thereto) and, in respect of any business day on which there shall be
 no such dealing, the price which is equal to (x) the mid-point between the high
Ryanair Holdings PLC Replacement: Notice of AGM
 and low market guide prices in respect of such shares for such business day as
 published in the Irish Stock Exchange Daily Official List (or any successor
 publication thereto), or (y) the market guide price published if there shall be
 only one such market guide price published, PROVIDED THAT if there shall not be
 any market guide price published for any particular day then that day shall not
 count as one of the said five business days for the purpose of determining the
 maximum price.  If the means of providing the foregoing information as to
 dealings and prices, by reference to which the maximum price is to be
 determined, is altered or is replaced by some other means, then the maximum
 price shall be determined on the basis of the equivalent information published
 by the relevant authority in relation to dealings on the Irish Stock Exchange or
 its equivalent.
7.5  Such authority shall expire at the close of business on the earlier of the
 date of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or 15 months from the
 date of the passing of this Resolution, unless previously varied, revoked or
 renewed in accordance with the provisions of Section 215 of the 1990 Act.  The
 Company or any subsidiary may before such expiry enter into a contract for the
 purchase of Ordinary Shares which would or might be wholly or partly executed
 after such expiry and may complete any such contract as if the authority
 conferred hereby had not expired.

 and shall unless previously renewed, revoked or varied by special resolution of the Company in general meeting, 
expire 15 months from the passing of this Resolution or, if earlier, on the close of business on the day following the 
next Annual General Meeting of the Company after the passing of this resolution, save that the Company may, 
before such expiry, make an offer or agreement which would or might require equity securities to be allotted after 
such expiry, and the Directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of such an offer or agreement as if the power 
conferred hereby had not expired."
 6. To consider and if thought fit pass the following Resolution as a Special Resolution:-
 "That the Company and/or any subsidiary (as such expression is defined by Section 155 of the Companies Act, 
1963) of the Company be and they are hereby generally authorised to make market purchases (as defined by 
section 212 of the Companies Act, 1990) of the Company's Ordinary Shares on such terms and conditions and in 
such manner as the Directors or, as the case may be, the Directors of such subsidiary, may from time to time 
determine in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, 1990 and the following 
restrictions and provisions:
 6.1 The maximum aggregate number of Ordinary Shares authorised to be acquired pursuant to this resolution shall 
not exceed 74.5 million Ordinary Shares;
 6.2 The minimum price which may be paid for any such share shall be an amount equal to the nominal value 
thereof;
 6.3 The maximum price which may be paid for any such share shall be an amount equal to the higher of:
 6.3.1 an amount equal to 105% of the average of the Relevant Price for such shares for the five
 business days before the purchase of the shares; and
 6.3.2 that stipulated by Article 5(1) of the Commission Regulation (EC) of December 22, 2003 (No.
 2273/2003);
 6.4 For the purpose of 6.3.1, "Relevant Price" means, in respect of any business day on which there shall be a 
dealing on the Irish Stock Exchange (or any successor thereto) in respect of such shares, the last price of such 
share as published in the Irish Stock Exchange Daily Official List (or any successor publication thereto) and, in 
respect of any business day on which there shall be no such dealing, the price which is equal to (x) the mid-point 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Notice of AGM -2-
between the high and low market guide prices in respect of such shares for such business day as published in the 
Irish Stock Exchange Daily Official List (or any successor publication thereto), or (y) the market guide price 
published if there shall be only one such market guide price published, PROVIDED THAT if there shall not be any 
market guide price published for any particular day then that day shall not count as one of the said five business 
days for the purpose of determining the maximum price. If the means of providing the foregoing information as to 
dealings and prices, by reference to which the maximum price is to be determined, is altered or is replaced by some 
other means, then the maximum price shall be determined on the basis of the equivalent information published by 
the relevant authority in relation to dealings on the Irish Stock Exchange or its equivalent.
 6.5 Such authority shall expire at the close of business on the earlier of the date of the next Annual General 
Meeting of the Company or 15 months from the date of the passing of this Resolution, unless previously varied, 
revoked or renewed in accordance with the provisions of Section 215 of the 1990 Act. The Company or any 
subsidiary may before such expiry enter into a contract for the purchase of Ordinary Shares which would or might 
be wholly or partly executed after such expiry and may complete any such contract as if the authority conferred 
hereby had not expired.

 AFPLATS - RESULT OF EGM
 African Platinum plc ("Afplats") announces that at the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company held earlier 
today the ordinary resolution put to shareholders was, notwithstanding the Board's unanimous recommendation to 
the contrary, duly carried, and therefore that Mr. Charles Hansard is no longer a director of Afplats.
 The Board has also been informed by Dr. Mark Bristow that he is resigning as an independent non-executive 
director with effect from close of business, Friday 4 August 2006 as he does not agree with this removal of Mr.

 Dealing Disclosure Requirements
 Under the provisions of Rule 8.3 of the Irish Takeover Panel Act, 1997, Takeover Rules 2007, as amended (the 
"Irish Takeover Rules"), if any person is, or becomes, 'interested' (directly or indirectly) in, 1 percent, or more of any 
class of 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus or Ryanair, all 'dealings' in any 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus or 
Ryanair (including by means of an option in respect of, or a derivative referenced to, any such 'relevant securities') 
must be publicly disclosed by not later than 3:30 pm (Dublin time) on the business day following the date of the 
relevant transaction. This requirement will continue until the date on which the Offer becomes effective or on which 
the 'Offer period' otherwise ends. If two or more persons co-operate on the basis of any agreement, either express 
or tacit, either oral or written, to acquire an 'interest' in 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus or Ryanair, they will be 
deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3 of the Irish Takeover Rules.
 Under the provisions of Rule 8.1 of the Irish Takeover Rules, all 'dealings' in 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus by 
Ryanair or 'relevant securities' of Ryanair by Aer Lingus, or by any of their respective 'associates' must also be 
disclosed by no later than 12 noon (Dublin time) on the business day following the date of the relevant transaction.
 A disclosure table, giving details of the companies in whose 'relevant securities' 'dealings' should be disclosed can 
be found on the Panel's website at www.irishtakeoverpanel.ie.
 'Interests in securities' arise, in summary, when a person has long economic exposure, whether conditional or 
absolute, to changes in the price of securities. In particular, a person will be treated as having an 'interest' by virtue 
of the ownership or control of securities, or by virtue of any option in respect of, or derivative referenced to, 
securities.
 Terms in quotation marks are defined in the Irish Takeover Rules, which can also be found on the Irish Takeover 
Panel's website. If you are in any doubt as to whether or not you are required to disclose a dealing under Rule 8, 
please consult the Panel's website at            www.irishtakeoverpanel.ie or
 contact the Panel on telephone number +353 1 678 9020; fax number +353 1 678 9289.

Body
 These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the
 interim financial statements"), which should be read in conjunction with our
 2008 Annual Report, have been prepared in accordance with International
 Accounting Standard No. 34 ("IAS 34") "Interim Financial Reporting" as adopted
 by the EU. They do not include all of the information required for full annual
 financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent
 published consolidated financial statements of the Group.
The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2008 do not
 constitute statutory financial statements of the Group within the meaning of
 Regulation 40 of the European Communities (Companies, Group Accounts)
 Regulations, 1992. Statutory financial statements for the year ended March 31,
 2008 are being filed with the Companies' Office. The auditors' report on those
 financial statements was unqualified.
In addition to the presentation of the condensed consolidated interim financial
 statements for the half-year period ended September 30, 2008, the condensed
 consolidated income statement and condensed consolidated statement of recognised
 income and expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 have also been
 provided on a supplementary basis and have been prepared in accordance with the
 measurement and recognition principles of IFRS as adopted by the EU.
 The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors,
 approved the interim financial statements for the six months ended September 30,
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -9-
 2008 on October 31, 2008.
Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been
 prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most
 recent published consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in
 accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and in compliance with IFRS's as
 issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
Exceptional items
 The Company presents certain items separately, which are unusual, by virtue of
 their size and incidence, in the context of our ongoing core operations, as we
 believe this presentation represents the underlying business more accurately and
 reflects the manner in which investors typically analyse the results. In the
 current period we have presented an impairment of a financial asset investment
 and also accelerated depreciation related to aircraft disposals separately
 because of the unusual nature of these items.  Any amounts deemed "exceptional"
 for management discussion and analysis purposes have been classified for the
 purposes of the income statement in the same way as non exceptional amounts of
 the same nature.
Reclassifications
 The Company has reclassified the following amounts in its comparative balance
 sheet as at March 31, 2008:
 *  a reclassification of EUR2.0m from other creditors to provisions, both within
 non-current liabilities, reflecting the present value of the Company's net
 pension obligations; and
 *  a reclassification of EUR23.1m from the capital redemption reserve fund to share
 premium related to the share buy-back.
Amounts have been reclassified so as to present these balances on a consistent
 basis with the current period presentation.
2.   Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements,
 estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual
 results may differ from these estimates.
Except as described below, in preparing these consolidated financial statements,
 the significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting
 policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those
 that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
3.    Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to
 quarter, and management expects these variations to continue. Among the factors
 causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to general
 economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Accordingly the first
 half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
4.   Income tax expense
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -9-
The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the six
 months ended September 30, 2008 was 9%.  As the Group is forecasting a breakeven
 outturn it is anticipated that a credit will be recorded in later quarters to
 offset this charge.
5.   Capital and reserves
 Share buy back programme.
 Pursuant to the share buy-back programme announced in February 2008, from April
 1, 2008 to date, the Company has repurchased and cancelled 18.1m shares at a
 total cost of EUR46m. This is equivalent to 1.2% of the issued share capital of
 the Company at September 30, 2008. (6.25m of these shares, with a value of EUR13m,
 were repurchased post the balance sheet date, in October 2008).
6.   Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most
 recent published consolidated financial statements.  The charge to the income
 statement in the period of approximately EUR1.5m is related to the fair value
 of various share options granted in prior periods, which are being recognised
 within the income statement in accordance with employee services rendered.
7.   Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its
 business.  The Group does not believe that any such litigation will individually
 or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
 Group. Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, management
 believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not
 expected to materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or
 financial position.
8.   Capital commitments
 During the half year ended September 30, 2008, the Group exercised seven options
 under the 2005 contract with Boeing whereby it will increase its "firm" aircraft
 deliveries by this amount during the 2011 fiscal year.At September 30, 2008,
 this brings Ryanair's total firm orders for Boeing 737-800 aircraft to 137 and
 the total fleet size (net of planned disposals) to 279 by 2013.
9.   Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 In the half year ended September 30, 2008, the Group recognised an impairment

Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 93 and 94

 Mr. Declan McKeon who were appointed as non-executive directors on May 28, 2010,

 condensed consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income, the condensed

 financial reporting adopted pursuant to the procedure provided for under Article
 6 of Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council
 of 19 July 2002.
2)   The interim management report includes a fair review of the information
 required by:
(i)     Regulation 8(2) of the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC)
 Regulations 2007, being an indication of important events that have occurred
 during the quarter ended June 30, 2010 and their impact on the condensed
 consolidated interim financial statements; and a description of the principal
 risks and uncertainties for the nine months ending March 31, 2011; and

 13. Shareholder distributions
 In the nine months ended December 31, 2015, the Company bought back 24.6M ordinary shares at a total cost 
of EUR288.8M under its EUR400.0M share buy-back programme which commenced in February 2015 and ended in 
August 2015.  This was equivalent to approximately 1.8% of the Company's issued share capital. All 
ordinary shares repurchased were cancelled.
 In addition to the above, the Company returned EUR398.0M to shareholders via a B share scheme, and 
completed a capital reorganisation which involved the consolidation of its ordinary share capital on a 39 
for 40 basis which resulted in the reduction of ordinary shares in issue by 33.8M ordinary shares to 
1,319.3M. The nominal value of an ordinary share was also reduced from EUR0.00635 each to EUR0.006 each 
under the reorganisation.  All 'B' Shares and Deferred Shares issued in connection with the B Share scheme 
were either redeemed or cancelled during the period such that there were no 'B' Shares or Deferred Shares 
remaining in issue as at December 31, 2015.
 In the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company bought back 10.9M ordinary shares at a total cost of 
EUR112.0M under its EUR400.0M share buyback programme referred to above.  This was equivalent to 
approximately 0.8% of the Company's issued share capital. All ordinary shares repurchased were cancelled.
 14.          Related party transactions
 We have related party relationships with our subsidiaries, directors and senior key management personnel. 
All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.

16 November 2004
TBI PLC   ("TBI" or "the Group")
Interim Results for the Six Months ended 30 September 2004
The TBI Group is one of the UK's leading airport operators. It owns and/or
operates London Luton, Belfast International and Cardiff International Airports,
as well as a number of overseas airports.
                                    SUMMARY
   Group turnover increased 4% to GBP107.6 million (2003: GBP103.4 million)
   Operating profit was up 64% to GBP24.1 million (2003: GBP14.7 million)
   Profit before tax was up 167% to GBP19.2 million (2003: GBP7.2 million),
     reflecting improved recurrent trading and the absence of any exceptional
     charges during the period
   Earnings per share:  1.79 pence  (2003:  0.01 pence);  Earnings per share
     before amortisation and exceptional items: 2.53 pence (2003:  2.13 pence)
   Proposed interim dividend maintained at 0.70 pence
   Passengers* rose to 10.8 million during the first six months of the year
     (2003:  9.6 million), a rise of 12% primarily driven by low cost, although
     there was growth across all three categories of traffic (charter, full
     service and low cost)
TBI PLC Interim Results
   Significant expansion by both easyJet and Ryanair at London Luton:
     easyJet is increasing capacity by 25%, adding three new aircraft and Ryanair
     has committed four new aircraft and nine new routes although any additional
     revenue is not expected to impact the current financial year
   Acquisition of remaining 28.6% interest in London Luton Airport from
     Alterra for approximately GBP78 million giving the Group total control of this
     core asset.  This acquisition is subject to shareholders' consent and
     certain financing conditions
   Disposal of AGI airport services for approximately US$24.0 million in cash
     (GBP13.3 million)
   October traffic statistics show a 13.8% increase in passenger traffic at
     the Group's European airports to 1.4 million (October 2003: 1.2 million),
     driven by low cost, up 19.4%
(* passengers = passengers excluding transit)
Keith Brooks, Chief Executive, comments:
"This period has been all about delivery. As well as producing increased
passenger numbers, revenues and profits, we have also achieved our objective of
making TBI a more focused airport operator. The sale of AGI ahead of schedule
and the acquisition of the London Luton minority leaves TBI well placed to
deliver increased value to shareholders."

Interim review 2004/5
Overview
These results reflect the growth in passenger volumes referred to in our trading
update last month. The number of passengers travelling through our airports in
the first six months of our financial year grew by 12% to 10.8 million
passengers (2003: 9.6 million). Whilst the majority of growth was driven by
passengers flying with low cost airlines, we saw growth in every category of
traffic (charter, full service and low cost) and at almost every airport. This
growth has translated to a GBP3.5 million increase in turnover at our owned
airports in the first half of the year, of which GBP2.7 million is reflected at
TBI PLC Interim Results
the operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items ("
EBITDA") level.
During this period of steadily improving performance we have also brought to
fruition some of the objectives which management has been working on for some
time. On 27 October 2004 we announced, subject to shareholder approval and
certain financing conditions, the acquisition of the remaining 28.6%
shareholding in London Luton Airport Group Limited which we did not previously
own. On completion, the concession at London Luton Airport would be wholly owned
by TBI, with all the benefits - strategic and tactical, operational and
financial - that full control brings. On the same day, we also announced the
disposal of our Airport Services business, AGI, for approximately US$24.0
million in cash (GBP13.3 million). Plans to sell this business were announced at
the time of our preliminary announcement in June this year.
Financials
Passenger numbers in the first half of the year increased by 12% and this is the
key driver of our business, however the full financial impact of growth in
passenger numbers is almost always muted initially because of reductions in
average aeronautical revenues in the early years of new services coming on
stream. Total revenues therefore increased by 4% to GBP107.6 million (2003: GBP103.4
million).
The conversion of revenue to profit at our owned and managed airports is usually
at a high rate on the incremental revenues because airports are relatively fixed
cost in nature. Accordingly EBITDA increased by 8% to GBP35.3 million (2003: GBP32.7
million). For owned and managed airports this represented an EBITDA margin of
40% (2003: 38%) overall and a marginal rate of 77% on the incremental revenue.
Operating profit was GBP24.1 million (2003: GBP14.7 million).
Profit before tax for the period was GBP19.2 million (2003: GBP7.2 million),
reflecting both improved recurrent trading as well as the absence of any
exceptional charges during this period. Earnings per share for the six month
period were 1.79p (2003: 0.01p), or 2.53p (2003: 2.13p), before amortisation and

exceptional items. The interim dividend is being maintained at 0.70p per share.
This will be payable on 4 January 2005 to shareholders on the register at the
close of business on 26 November 2004.
London Luton
Overall passenger numbers increased by 9% to 4.1 million (2003: 3.8 million)
during the six months to 30th September 2004. In July both easyJet and Ryanair
announced significant expansion of their services out of London Luton,
commencing over the next eight months. easyJet will increase its capacity by
25%, adding three new aircraft, and Ryanair has committed four new aircraft and
nine new routes. This traffic has not yet started and therefore the benefit of
any additional revenue is not expected to impact the current financial period.
As a result of the capacity demand at Luton we have commenced an extensive
expansion programme. This is expected to complete in July 2005, to coincide with
the annual peak in passengers using the airport. The programme will cost
approximately GBP30.0 million, spread over two financial years, and will deliver a
new security hall to the first floor of the new terminal building and a new
airside facility to handle all passengers travelling through the airport. The
new airside facility will be some 9,000m2 - and will almost double the retail
and catering space. In addition there will be a new pier, a new immigration
hall, new arrivals and onward travel areas, eight new gates and two new aircraft
aprons. This development will provide capacity for up to 12.0 million passengers
a year.
Belfast International
Belfast ("BIA") has continued to demonstrate good growth in the six months to 30
September 2004. Passenger numbers were up 12% to 2.5 million (2003: 2.2 million)
due to strong low cost and charter growth. However, it is not anticipated that
the forthcoming winter charter traffic will demonstrate similar levels of
growth. The low cost growth profile is likely to extend into the winter period,
reflecting the full year effect of the new international services provided by
the low cost airlines. Continuing the theme of direct international services,
TBI PLC Interim Results
Continental Airlines has recently announced the launch of a non stop scheduled
service between Belfast and New York (Newark) from May 2005, firmly positioning
BIA as the only international gateway to Northern Ireland. It is anticipated
that this international service will benefit from high levels of demand both
from business and leisure customers in Northern Ireland and its catchment area.
Cardiff
Passenger numbers at Cardiff fell by 4% to 1.2 million (2003: 1.2 million),
primarily as a result of the reduction in capacity and services flown by
bmibaby. The financial impact of this was mitigated in part by the increase in
the number of passengers flying on KLM. Average aeronautical revenues per
passenger rose by 9% as a consequence of the change in mix.
We are delighted that the Welsh Assembly Government has announced the re-opening
of the Vale of Glamorgan Line with a new railway station adjacent to the airport
in Spring 2005. The station will be known as Rhoose Cardiff International
Airport and will improve access to this airport's natural catchment area.
Stockholm Skavsta
Skavsta has demonstrated strong growth in passenger numbers in the period, up
22% to 0.7 million (2003: 0.6 million), as a result of the success of the
Ryanair services. Not only did passenger volumes increase significantly but both
commercial and aeronautical revenues per passenger also increased. As a result,
turnover increased by approximately GBP0.8 million when compared with last year -
with a 100% rate of marginal conversion into EBITDA. More recently Ryanair has
announced that it will base a further aircraft at Stockholm Skavsta from March
2005 serving three new routes to Dusseldorf, Barcelona (Girona) and Riga.
Ryanair has subsequently announced that a further two aircraft will be based at
Stockholm Skavsta from 2006. Some limited additional investment will be
necessary to expand the ramp and apron at this location in order to accommodate
these additional services.
Orlando Sanford
In Orlando, notwithstanding the adverse weather conditions in August/September,

passenger numbers increased by almost 50% to 1.2 million (2003: 0.8 million).

 Irish Stock Exchange welcomes Budget initiative to exempt ESM companies from stamp duty
 Tuesday, 15(th) October 2013
 The Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) welcomes the Government's 2014 Budget announcement that it is to exempt from 
stamp duty the transfer of shares of companies on the Enterprise Securities Market (ESM). Stamp duty is currently 
charged at a rate of 1% on investments made in the shares of Irish companies.
 The ISE has long campaigned for the removal of stamp duty on investing in Irish companies - this initiative enables 
ESM companies to operate on a level playing field with their international peers when competing for international 
investment. It matches similar proposals made in the UK earlier this year and moves the Irish market more in line 
with European norms.
 The exemption of ESM companies from stamp duty, the ISE's market for small to medium sized growth companies, 
supports enterprise, growth and employment in Ireland and will help Irish companies to build scale in their business 
through public markets. It will also have a positive impact on investors including pension funds which invest in the 
shares of Irish companies quoted on the ESM.
 ISE Chief Executive Deirdre Somers said the proposal is an essential step in creating the next generation of 
leading Irish publicly-quoted companies and meets some of the Government's stated objectives in the Action Plan 
for Jobs - to incentivise dynamic companies to choose growth and scale using the IPO route as an alternative to 
trade sale.
 "Ireland needs to ensure that Irish companies are as attractive as their international peers when it comes to 
investment. We welcome that ESM companies will now be exempt from stamp duty as this tax acted as a barrier to 
international investment. This initiative is an important step in the creation of the next generation of leading 
companies in Ireland which choose the IPO route to grow - like Ryanair, Kerry Group and Paddy Power. High-
Irish Stock Exchange ESM companies exemption from stamp duty
quality, scalable businesses can create jobs and deliver much needed growth in the Irish economy", said Ms 
Somers.

 RYANAIR UPDATE ON AER LINGUS
 Further to Ryanair's Q3 results announcement issued today (Jan 28), the following is an update in 
relation to the Aer Lingus offer:
 Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary Said:
 "Ryanair has submitted a radical and unprecedented remedies package to the EU in support of its offer for 
Aer Lingus.  We believe these remedies address every current Ryanair\Aer Lingus crossover route and all 
other competition issues raised by the Commission in its Statement of Objections. The remedies involve two 
upfront buyers each basing aircraft in Ireland to takeover and operate a substantial part of Aer Lingus' 
existing route network and short-haul business.  This will be the first EU airline merger which will 
deliver structural divestitures and multiple upfront buyers.  We look forward to completing our offer for 
Aer Lingus subject to receiving approval from the EU competition authorities in early March".

 The expected long-term rate of return on assets of 6.75% (2010: 6.67%; 2009: 6.40%) for the Irish scheme was 
calculated based on the assumptions of the following returns for each asset class: Equities 7.50% (2010: 7.75%; 
2009: 8.00%); Bonds 4.50% (2010: 3.50%; 2009: 3.50% ); Property 6.25% (2010: 6.25%; 2009: 6.25%); and Cash 
3.00% (2010: 2.00%; 2009: 2.00%). The expected long-term rate of return on assets of 7.55% (2010: 7.45%; 2009: 
7.18%) for the UK scheme was calculated based on the assumptions of the following returns for each asset class: 
Equities 8.10% (2010: 8.30%; 2009: 8.00%); Corporate and Overseas Bonds 5.60% (2010: 5.50%; 2009: 6.30%); 
and Other 3.00% (2010: 2.27%; 2009: 2.00%).
 Since there are no suitable euro-denominated AA-rated corporate bonds, the expected return is estimated by 
adding a suitable risk premium to the rate available from government bonds. The assumptions are based on long-
term expectations at the beginning of the reporting period and are expected to be relatively stable.
 The history of the plans for the current and prior periods is as follows:

 (a) Details of share options in issue have been described more fully in Note 15 to the consolidated financial 
statements.
 Basic earnings per ordinary share (EPS) for Ryanair Holdings plc for the years ended March 31, 2011, 2010 and 
2009 has been computed by dividing the profit/(loss) attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -83-
 Diluted earnings per share takes account solely of the potential future exercise of share options granted under the 
Company's share option schemes. For the 2011 fiscal year, the weighted average number of shares in issue of 
1,490.1 million includes weighted average share options assumed to be converted equal to 4.4 million. For the 2010 
fiscal year, the weighted average number of shares in issue of 1,481.7 million includes weighted average share 
options assumed to be converted equal to 5.3 million. For the 2009 fiscal year, there was no difference in the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares used for the basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share, as the 
effect of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares (2.8 million outstanding) was anti-dilutive.

RYANAIR'S TRAFFIC GROWS 19% IN JULY
Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, today (5 Aug 09) announced that its
 passenger traffic grew by 19% in July 2009 to 6.7m passengers which is a new
 monthly traffic record for Europe's largest low fares airline.
 Ryanair's continued growth underlines that passengers during this recession are
 increasingly switching from high fare, fuel surcharging flag carriers, such as
 Air France, BA, Lufthansa and Aer Lingus who are losing passengers to Ryanair's
 lowest fares and no fuel surcharge guarantee.
 The following are Ryanair's traffic and load factor stats for July 2009.

 1.  Represents the number of booked seats flown by Ryanair.
 2.   Represents the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats
 available for passengers.
Ryanair's Daniel de Carvalho said:
"Ryanair continues to grow traffic strongly each month as passengers switch to
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 's Traffic Grows 19% in July
 Ryanair's lowest fares and no fuel surcharge guarantee over the high fares and
 unfair fuel surcharges being levied by many of our competitors.
"Ryanair carried 19% more passengers this July than last year and Ryanair now
 carries almost three times BA's worldwide recent traffic which clearly makes
 Ryanair "the world's favourite airline".

Ryanair Holdings PLC
11 December 2007
                       RYANAIR ANNOUNCES 5 NEW ROUTES AND
                 A 5th AIRCRAFT AT ITS BRUSSELS CHARLEROI BASE
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Tuesday, 11th December 2007)
announced 5 new routes from Brussels Charleroi to Bergerac, Limoges, Perpignan,
Porto and Zaragoza and a 5th Boeing 737-800 aircraft will be based in the
Belgian capital from 5th March. Next summer (2008), Ryanair will operate 26
routes to / from Brussels Charleroi in 2008, carrying over 2.5m passengers who
will sustain over 2,500 Belgian jobs in Wallonia.
BSCA's partnership with Ryanair continues to be a huge success, transforming
Brussels Charleroi airport from an empty, loss making white elephant into a
profitable, thriving, wealth generator. Ryanair welcomes the opening of BSCA's
new terminal in January 2008 which will deliver more low fare routes and more
visitors for the Walloon region. The continuing benefits of Ryanair's growth at
Ryanair Holdings PLC NEW ROUTES AT CHARLEROI BASE
BSCA for the airport and the Walloon region highlights the absurdity of the
Commission's flawed and untenable 2003 state aid ruling at Charleroi. Ryanair is
confident that this unlawful ruling will be overturned on appeal by the European
Court of First Instance. This appeal will be heard in Feb 2008.
The European Commission continues to adopt a biased and discriminatory approach
to State Aid cases by repeatedly ignoring Ryanair complaints about EUR billions of
state aid provided to inefficient flag carriers while investigating spurious
complaints by competitors, about free market deals at tiny regional airports
which are perfectly lawful under the Commission's market investor principal.
Ryanair looks forward the European Commission being forced by the ECI to address
the following flagrant breaches of state aid rules which it has ignored for the
past two years:
   State aid of EUR1bn to Air France in the form of reduced domestic airport
     charges
    State aid of EUR100m to Lufthansa through its sole use of loss making T2 at
     Munich
    State aid of over EUR500m to the loss making Olympic Airways in Greece
    State aid of over EUR20m to Alitalia's subsidiary, Volare, through airport
     debt write-offs
    State aid of over 1.7bn to Alitalia through recapitalisation and debt
     write-off
Announcing Ryanair's latest expansion in Brussels, CEO Michael O'Leary said:
        "Ryanair's 5 new routes at Brussels Charleroi are great news for Belgian
         tourism, Belgian business and Belgian consumers who will enjoy even more
         of Europe's guaranteed lowest fares to 26 destinations next year. We are
         delighted that BSCA continues to grow and prosper with Ryanair and
         welcome the opening of their new terminal which will enable the
         development of even more low fare routes for Belgian passengers /
         visitors.
        "The huge success of the BSCA's low cost agreement with Ryanair exposes
         the stupidity of the EU's unlawful decision at Charleroi. We look
         forward to the European Court of First Instance forcing the European
         Commission to end their discrimination by addressing the real and
         repeated breaches of state aid to flag carriers which they have ignored
         for the past two years.
        "To celebrate these 5 new routes from Brussels Charleroi, we are
         releasing 100,000 seats for travel between January and March for just
         EUR10 including taxes on www.ryanair.com. We advise passengers to book
         immediately as this offer will end midnight Thursday".
To accommodate these 5 new routes, Ryanair will stop flying from Brussels to
London Stansted from 5th March 2008.

 B.            105% of the average of the Relevant Price for such Ordinary Shares of the same class for 
each of the five (5) business days immediately preceding the day of the purchase of the Ordinary Shares.

closing price of such shares as published in the ISE Daily Official List, or in respect of the purchase of 
shares traded on the London Stock Exchange plc (or any successor thereto) ("LSE"), the official closing 
price of such shares as published in the LSE Daily Official List, or if on any business day there shall be 
no dealing of shares on the trading venue where the purchase is carried out, the Relevant Price shall be 
determined by such other method as the Directors shall determine, in their sole discretion, to be fair and 
reasonable;
 (v)           For the purpose of sub-paragraph (iii) B, "Relevant Price" means, in respect of the 
purchase of Ordinary Shares underlying ADSs traded on NASDAQ, on any business day on which there shall be 
a dealing in ADSs on NASDAQ (or any successor thereto), one-fifth of the NASDAQ Official Close Price in 
respect of such ADSs as published by NASDAQ (or its equivalent if such a price is no longer published by 
NASDAQ) and, or if on any business day there shall be no dealing of shares on the trading venue where the 
purchase is carried out, the Relevant Price shall be determined by such other method as the Directors 
shall determine, in their sole discretion, to be fair and reasonable;
 (vi)          This authority will expire on the earlier of either the date of the next Annual General 
Meeting or 15 months from the date of the passing of this resolution, unless previously varied, revoked or 
renewed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1074 of the Companies Act. The Company or any 
subsidiary may before such expiry enter into a contract for the purchase of Ordinary Shares which would or 
might be wholly or partly executed after such expiry and may complete any such contract as if the 
authority conferred hereby had not expired."

At March 31, 2012, aircraft with a net book value of EUR4,856.0 million (2011: EUR4,718.7 million; 2010: 
EUR3,863.0 million) were mortgaged to lenders as security for loans. Under the security arrangements for 
the Company's new Boeing 737-800 "next generation" aircraft, the Company does not hold legal title to 
those aircraft while these loan amounts remain outstanding.
 At March 31, 2012, the cost and net book value of aircraft includes EUR110.5 million (2011: EUR194.2 
million; 2010: EUR397.8 million) in respect of advance payments on aircraft. This amount is not 
depreciated. The cost and net book value also includes capitalised aircraft maintenance, aircraft 
simulators and the stock of rotable spare parts.
 The net book value of assets held under finance leases at March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was EUR607.5 
million, EUR635.1 million and EUR422.8 million respectively.
 Sale proceeds of EUR27.2 million were generated from the disposal of spare engines during the year.  In 
fiscal year 2010, EUR89.2 million in sales proceeds comprised EUR65.6 million from the sale of three 
aircraft and EUR23.6 million in respect of the sale of spare engines and insurance proceeds from an 
aircraft damaged by a bird strike in 2009.
 There were no Boeing 737-800 aircraft disposed of during the year (2011: nil; 2010: 3). There is no 
agreement to dispose of further aircraft at future dates.
 During the 2012 fiscal year, no accelerated depreciation (2011: nil; 2010: nil) arose in relation to 
aircraft disposals or agreements to dispose of aircraft at future dates.

 rights......................................................................................      46.8   
46.8   46.8
 =====  =====  =====
Landing slots were acquired with the acquisition of Buzz Stansted Limited in April 2003. As these landing 
slots have no expiry date and are expected to be used in perpetuity, they are considered to be of 
indefinite life and accordingly are not amortised. The Company also considers that there has been no 
impairment of the value of these rights to date. The recoverable amount of these rights has been 
determined on a value-in-use basis, using discounted cash-flow projections for a twenty-year period for 
each route that has an individual landing right. The calculation of value-in-use is most sensitive to the 
operating margin and discount rate assumptions. Operating margins are based on the existing margins 
generated from these routes and adjusted for any known trading conditions. The trading environment is 
subject to both regulatory and competitive pressures that can have a material effect on the operating 
performance of the business. Foreseeable events, however, are unlikely to result in a change of 
projections of a significant nature so as to result in the landing rights' carrying amounts exceeding 
their recoverable amounts. These projections have been discounted using weighted average cost of capital, 
estimated to be 7.7% for 2012, 7.3% for 2011 and 6.1% for 2010.

losses are recognised in the income statement and any cumulative loss previously recognised in other

 The weighted-average interest rate on the cumulative borrowings under these facilities of EUR3,083.6 million at 
March 31, 2014 was 2.49%. Ryanair's ability to obtain additional loans pursuant to each of the facilities to finance 
the price of future Boeing 737-800 aircraft purchases is subject to the issuance of further bank commitments and 
the satisfaction of various contractual conditions. In addition, as a result of the Company obtaining a BBB+ credit 
rating from Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings and following Ryanair's recent issuance in June 2014 of an 
unsecured eurobond in the amount of EUR850.0 million with a coupon of 1.875% with a tenor of 7 years that are 
guaranteed by Ryanair Holdings, the Company may decide in the future to issue additional debt from through the 
capital markets to finance future aircraft deliveries. These conditions include, among other things, the execution of 
satisfactory documentation, the requirement that Ryanair perform all of its obligations under the Boeing agreements 
and provide satisfactory security interests in the aircraft (and related assets) in favor of the lenders and Ex-Im Bank, 
and that Ryanair not suffer a material adverse change in its conditions or prospects (financial or otherwise).
 As part of its Ex-Im Bank guarantee-based financing of the Boeing 737-800s, Ryanair has entered into certain 
lease agreements and related arrangements. Pursuant to these arrangements, legal title to the 210 aircraft 
delivered and remaining in the fleet as of March 31, 2014 rests with a number of United States special purpose 
vehicles (the "SPVs"). The SPVs are the borrowers of record under the loans made or to be made under the 
facilities, with all of their obligations under the loans being guaranteed by Ryanair Holdings.
 These Aircraft are financed using a standard Ex-Im Bank "orphan" ownership structure. The shares of the SPVs 
(which are owned by an unrelated charitable association and not by Ryanair) are in turn pledged to a security 
trustee in favor of Ex-Im Bank and the lenders. Ryanair operates each of the aircraft pursuant to a finance lease it 
has entered into with the SPVs, the terms of which mirror those of the relevant loans under the facilities. Ryanair 
has the right to purchase the aircraft upon termination of the lease for a nominal amount. Pursuant to this 
arrangement, Ryanair is considered to own the aircraft for accounting purposes under IFRS. Ryanair does not use 
special purpose entities for off-balance sheet financing or any other purpose which results in assets or liabilities not 
being reflected in Ryanair's consolidated financial statements. In addition to its purchase option under the finance 
lease, Ryanair is entitled to receive the balance of any proceeds received in respect of the aircraft that remain after 
Ex-Im Bank and the lenders are paid what they are owed under the loan guarantees.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -43-
 Ryanair has a track record in securing finance for similar sized aircraft purchases. The 1998, 2002, 2003 and 2005 
Boeing Contracts totaling 348 aircraft were financed with approximately 66% US Ex-Im Bank loan guarantees and 
capital markets (with 85% loan to value) financing, 24% through sale and operating leaseback financing, and 10% 
through Japanese operating leases with call options ("JOLCOs"). See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and 
Prospects-Liquidity and Capital Resources."
 Under the new Aviation Sector Understanding which came into effect from January 1, 2013, the fees payable to 
Ex-Im Bank for the provision of loan guarantees have significantly increased, thereby making it more expensive 
than more traditional forms of financing. As a result, Ryanair intends to finance the New Aircraft obtained under the 
2013 Boeing Contract through a combination of internally generated cash flows, debt financing from commercial 
banks, debt financing through the capital markets in a secured and unsecured manner, commercial debt through 
JOLCOs and sale and operating leasebacks. These forms of financing are generally accepted in the aviation 
industry and are currently widely available for companies who have the credit quality of Ryanair. Ryanair may 
periodically use Ex-Im Bank loan guarantees when appropriate. Ryanair intends to finance pre-delivery payments 
("Aircraft Deposits") to Boeing in respect of the New Aircraft via internally generated cash flows similar to all 
previous Aircraft Deposit payments.
 At March 31, 2014, Ryanair had 51 operating lease aircraft in the fleet. As a result, Ryanair operates, but does not 
own, these aircraft, which were leased to provide flexibility for the aircraft delivery program. Ryanair has no right or 
obligation to acquire these aircraft at the end of the relevant lease terms. 18 leases are denominated in euro and 
require Ryanair to make fixed rental payments over the term of the lease. The remaining 33 operating leases are 
U.S. dollar-denominated and require Ryanair to make fixed rental payments. The Company has an option to extend 
the initial period of seven years on 34 of the 51 remaining operating lease aircraft as at March 31, 2014 on pre-
determined terms. This includes 3 operating lease arrangements which are due to mature during the year ended 
March 31, 2015 but have been extended for a further 7 years. In addition to the above, the Company financed 30 of 
the Boeing 737-800 aircraft delivered between March 2005 and March 2014 with 13-year euro-denominated 
JOLCOs. These structures are accounted for as finance leases and are initially recorded at fair value in the 
Company's balance sheet. Under each of these contracts, Ryanair has a call option to purchase the aircraft at a 
pre-determined price after a period of 10.5 years, which it may exercise. Six aircraft have been financed through 
euro-denominated 12-year amortizing commercial debt transactions.
 Since, under each of the Company's operating leases, the Company has a commitment to maintain the relevant 
aircraft, an accounting provision is made during the lease term for this obligation based on estimated future costs of 
major airframe, engine maintenance checks and restitution of major life limited parts by making appropriate charges 
to the income statement calculated by reference to the number of hours or cycles operated during the year. Under 
IFRS, the accounting treatment for these costs with respect to leased aircraft differs from that for aircraft owned by 
the Company, for which such costs are capitalized and amortized.
 Ryanair recently obtained a BBB+ (stable) corporate rating from both Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings and 
established a EUR3 billion EMTN program. In June 2014, Ryanair issued EUR850.0 million in unsecured 
eurobonds with a 7 year tenor at a coupon of 1.875% under this program that are guaranteed by Ryanair Holdings. 
The Company intends to use the proceeds from this issuance for general corporate purposes, including the 
financing of aircraft.
 Contractual Obligations. The table below sets forth the contractual obligations and commercial commitments of the 
Company with definitive payment terms, which will require significant cash outlays in the future, as of March 31, 
2014. These obligations primarily relate to Ryanair's aircraft purchase and related financing obligations, which are 
described in more detail above, and do not reflect the EUR850.0 million in eurobonds issued in June 2014. For 
additional information on the Company's contractual obligations and commercial commitments, see Note 23 to the 
consolidated financial statements included in Item 18.
 The amounts listed under "Finance Lease Obligations" reflect the Company's obligations under its JOLCOs. See 
"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects 3/4 Liquidity and Capital Resources."
 The amounts listed under "Purchase Obligations" in the table reflect obligations for aircraft purchases and are 
calculated by multiplying the number of aircraft the Company is obligated to purchase under its current agreements 
with Boeing during the relevant period by the Basic Price for each aircraft pursuant to the relevant contract, with the 
dollar-denominated Basic Price being converted into euro at an exchange rate of $1.3788 =EUR1.00 (based on the 
European Central Bank Rate on March 31, 2014). The relevant amounts therefore exclude the effect of the price 
concessions granted to Ryanair by Boeing and CFM, as well as any application of the Escalation Factor described 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -43-
below. As a result, Ryanair's actual expenditures for aircraft during the relevant periods will be lower than the 
amounts listed under "Purchase Obligations" in the table.
 With respect to purchase obligations under the terms of the 2013 Boeing Contract, the Company was required to 
pay Boeing 1% of the Basic Price of each of the 175 firm-order Boeing 737-800 aircraft at the time the contract was 
signed in April 2013 (such deposit being fully refundable if the Company had not received the shareholder approval 
it received at an extraordinary general meeting on June 18, 2013), and will be required to make periodic advance 
payments of the purchase price for each aircraft it has agreed to purchase during the course of the two-year period 
preceding the delivery of each aircraft. As a result of these required advance payments, the Company will have paid 
up to 30% of the Basic Price of each aircraft prior to its delivery (including the addition of an estimated "Escalation 
Factor" but before deduction of any credit memoranda and other concessions); the balance of the net price is due 
at the time of delivery. Similar terms applied under the 2005 Boeing contract, with the first payment due when the 
contract was signed in February 2005.
 The amounts listed under "Operating Lease Obligations" reflect the Company's obligations under its aircraft 
operating lease arrangements.

Profit after tax, increased by 26% to EUR268.7m due to a 22% increase in passenger
numbers, a 1% decrease in fares (including checked in baggage revenues) and
strong growth in ancillary revenues. The growth in revenues was offset by a
combination of increased airport costs which rose by 50% to EUR107.1m arising from
the doubling of airport charges at Stansted and higher charges at Dublin
Airport, and a one off step up in staff costs, primarily due to higher cabin
crewing ratios, which rose by 23% to EUR70.4m. Operating margins, as a result,
decreased by 1 point to 35%, which in turn resulted in operating profit
increasing by 22% to EUR304.0m compared to the previous quarter ended September
30, 2006.
Total operating revenues increased by 25% to EUR861.3m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 22% to 14.0m. Total revenue per passenger increased by 3% due to
strong ancillary revenue growth.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 21% to EUR726.1m due to a 22% increase
in traffic reflecting increased passenger numbers on existing routes and the
successful launch of new routes and bases. During the period average fares
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Results Announced -5-
(including checked baggage revenues) were down by 1% whilst load factor remained
flat at 89% during the quarter.
Ancillary revenues continue to grow faster than passenger volumes with revenues
increasing by 54% to EUR135.3m in the quarter. This performance reflects the
strong growth in on board sales, excess baggage revenues, non-flight scheduled
revenue and other ancillary products.
Total operating expenses rose by 26% to EUR557.3m due to the increased level of
activity, and the increased costs associated with the growth of the airline
particularly higher airport charges and staff costs. Total operating expenses
were also adversely impacted by a 7% increase in average sector length.
Staff costs have increased by 23% to EUR70.4m. This primarily reflects a 29%
increase in average employee numbers to 5,024 and the impact of pay increases
granted during the year. Employee numbers rose due to an increase in cabin
crewing ratios as a result of a new EU working directive.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 15% to EUR41.3m. This reflects an
additional 22 lower cost 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this quarter compared to
September 30, 2006, offset by a revision of the residual value of the fleet to
reflect current market valuations and the positive impact on amortisation of the
stronger euro versus the US dollar.
Fuel costs rose by 19% to EUR202.3m due to a 30% increase in number of hours flown
offset by a 10% decrease in the average euro equivalent cost per gallon of fuel
hedged and a reduction in fuel consumption due to the installation of winglets.
Maintenance costs increased by 35% to EUR14.3m, due to a combination of the
increase in the number of leased aircraft from 24 to 35, and the positive impact
of a stronger euro versus the US dollar exchange rate.
Marketing and distribution costs increased by 6% to EUR6.2m due to the growth of
the airline and the increased commissions payable to airports arising from the
growth in baggage revenues.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 43% to EUR18.5m reflecting an additional 11
leased aircraft operating during the quarter compared to the same quarter last
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Results Announced -5-
year.
Route charges rose by 31% to EUR65.8m due to an increase in the number of sectors
flown and an increase of 7% in the average sector length.
Airport and handling charges increased by 50% to EUR107.1m. This is higher than
the growth in passenger volumes and reflects the impact of the doubling of costs
at Stansted Airport and higher charges at Dublin Airport, offset by lower costs
at new airports and bases.
Other expenses increased by 17% to EUR34.1m, which is lower than the growth in
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some existing products and cost
reductions on some indirect costs.
Operating margins fell by 1 point to 35% for to the reasons outlined above
whilst operating profits have increased by 22% to EUR304.0m during the quarter.
Interest receivable has increased by 33% to EUR21.4m for the quarter primarily due
to the increase in average deposit rates earned in the period, offset somewhat
by a lower average cash balance.
Interest payable increased by 6% to 21.9m due to the drawdown of further debt
to part fund the purchase of new aircraft and the adverse impact of higher
interest rates.

                     Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
                                      Notes
1. Reporting entity
    Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The
     condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the
     six months ended September 30, 2007 comprise the Company and its
     subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
    The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the year
     ended March 31, 2007 are available at www.ryanair.com.
2. Statement of compliance
    These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the
     interim financial statements") have been prepared in accordance with
     International Accounting Standards ("IAS") "Interim Financial Reporting" as
     endorsed by the European Union. They do not include all of the information
     required for full annual financial statements, and should be read in
     conjunction with the most recent published consolidated financial statements
     of the Group.
    The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2007 do not
     constitute statutory financial statements of the Group within the meaning of
     regulation 40 of the European Communities (companies, group accounts)
     regulations, 1992. Statutory financial statements for the year ended March
     31, 2007 have been filed with the companies' office. The auditors' report on
     these financial statements was unqualified.
    The Audit Committee approved the interim financial statements for the half
     year ended September 30, 2007 on November 2, 2007.
3. Significant accounting policies
    Except as stated otherwise below, this quarter's financial information has
     been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the
     Group's most recent published consolidated financial statements, which were
     prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
     ("IFRS") as adopted by the EU.
4. Generally Accepted Accounting Policies
    The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results (Operating and Financial
     Overview) for the half year ended September 30, 2007 and the comparative
     half year are based on the results reported under the Group's IFRS
     accounting policies.
5. Estimates
    The preparation of financial statements requires management to make
     judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of
     accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
     income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Results Announced -5-
    Except as described below, in preparing these consolidated financial
     statements, the significant judgements made by management in applying the
     Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty
     were the same as those that applied in the most recent published
     consolidated financial statements.
    During the period ended September 30, 2007 management reassessed its
     estimates of the recoverable amount of aircraft residual values following
     certain recent aircraft disposals and trends in the market.
6. Seasonality of operations
    The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to
     quarter, and management expects these variations to continue. Among the
     factors causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to
     general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.
     Accordingly the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and
     results.
7. Income tax expense
    The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the
     six months ended September 30, 2007 was approximately 11.5 percent, in line
     with the same period last year.
8. Capital and reserves
    Share buy back programme.
    The Company commenced a share buy back programme in June 2007. To date 53.5m
     shares, at an approximate cost of EUR267m, have been purchased for

                  RECORD MONTHLY PASSENGER TRAFFIC FOR RYANAIR
                      APRIL TRAFFIC RISES TO 3.44 MILLION
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (Thursday, 4th May 2006)
celebrated its highest ever monthly passenger traffic with a record 3.44 M
passengers in April, a 29% increase on 2005.
Announcing the record passenger traffic, Peter Sherrard Ryanair's Head of
Communications, said:
        "In the single month of April 2006, Ryanair carried more passengers than
         it did during the whole 12 months of 1997. Ryanair now operates 332
         routes to and from 117 airports across 22 countries and there is no
         better proof of Ryanair's popularity than passenger growth throughout
         Europe.
        "Ryanair is growing while British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France all
         stagnate in Europe because passengers want Ryanair's low fare, on time
         and efficient services and they know they will not find these with the
         high fare usually late, fuel surchargers".

Body
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.            Capital commitments
 At June 30, 2017 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 397 (2016: 353) Boeing 737 aircraft.  The Group agreed 
to purchase 183 new Boeing 737-800NG aircraft from the Boeing Corporation during the periods FY15 to FY19 
of which 11 aircraft were delivered in the year ended March 31, 2015, 41 were delivered in the year ended 
March 31, 2016, a further 52 were delivered in the year ended March 31, 2017 and 14 in the quarter ended 
June 30, 2017.
 The Group also agreed to purchase up to 210 (110 firm and 100 options) Boeing 737 Max 200 aircraft from 
the Boeing Corporation during the periods FY20 to FY24; these include 10 additional firm orders announced 
in June 2017 which will see aircraft deliveries increase by 5 in spring 2019 and 5 in spring 2020.
 8.            Analysis of operating segment
 The Group is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car-hire, internet income and related sales to third parties. The Group 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided 
to the CEO, who is the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource allocation 
decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data. However, resource allocation decisions are made 
based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in 
type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial 
results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the adjusted profit/(loss) after tax of the 
Group for the period.  All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Group has 
a single reportable segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Group's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed 
across the Group's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment 
operations.  In addition, as the Group is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and 
liabilities have been allocated to the Group's single reportable segment.

 10.          Property, plant and equipment
 Acquisitions and disposals
 Capital expenditure in the quarter to June 30, 2017 amounted to EUR392.6M and primarily relates to 
aircraft pre delivery payments and 14 aircraft deliveries.
 11.          Financial instruments and financial risk management
 The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 These preliminary financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2016 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the period.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --           Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
that the Group can access at the measurement date.
 --           Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
that asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --           Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 Fair value estimation
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -5-
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --           Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to determine 
the fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
 --           Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and carbon swaps: A comparison of 
the contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at March 31, 2017 
has been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the quarter to June 30, 2017, there 
were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 Financial instruments disclosed at fair value
 --           Fixed-rate long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been 
discounted at the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at June 30, 2017 
to arrive at a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
 There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the quarter to June 
30, 2017 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.
 11.          Financial instruments and financial risk management (continued)
 The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial balance sheet, are as follows:

 rights......................................................................................      46.8

 =====  =====  =====
Landing slots were acquired with the acquisition of Buzz Stansted Limited in April 2003. As these landing 
slots have no expiry date and are expected to be used in perpetuity, they are considered to be of 
indefinite life and accordingly are not amortised. The Company also considers that there has been no 
impairment of the value of these rights to date. The recoverable amount of these rights has been 
determined on a value-in-use basis, using discounted cash-flow projections for a twenty-year period for 
each route that has an individual landing right. The calculation of value-in-use is most sensitive to the 
operating margin and discount rate assumptions. Operating margins are based on the existing margins 
generated from these routes and adjusted for any known trading conditions. The trading environment is 
subject to both regulatory and competitive pressures that can have a material effect on the operating 
performance of the business. Foreseeable events, however, are unlikely to result in a change of 
projections of a significant nature so as to result in the landing rights' carrying amounts exceeding 
their recoverable amounts. These projections have been discounted based on the estimated discount rate 
applicable to the asset of 7.0% for 2013, 7.7% for 2012 and 7.3% for 2011.

Investment in Aer Lingus...............................................................    221.2   149.7   
114.0
 ======  ======  ======
As at March 31, 2013 Ryanair's total percentage shareholding in Aer Lingus was 29.8% (2012: 29.8%; 2011: 
29.8%). The balance sheet value of EUR221.2 million (2012: EUR149.7 million; 2011: EUR114.0 million) reflects 
the market value of this investment as at March 31, 2013. In accordance with the Company's accounting policy, this 
asset is held at fair value with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income following initial 
acquisition. Any impairment losses that arise are recognised in the income statement and are not subsequently 
reversed.  Any cumulative loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income 
statement once an impairment is considered to have occurred.
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR149.7 million at March 31, 2012 to EUR221.2 
million at March 31, 2013 is comprised of a gain of EUR71.5 million, recognised through other comprehensive 
income, reflecting the increase in the share price of Aer Lingus from EUR0.94 per share at March 31, 2012 to 
approximately EUR1.39 per share at March 31, 2013.  The investment in Aer Lingus has in prior periods been 
impaired to EUR0.50 per share.
 This investment is classified as available-for-sale, rather than as an investment in an associate, because the 
Company does not have the power to exercise any influence over the entity. The Company's determination that it 
does not have any influence over Aer Lingus through its minority shareholding has been based on the following 
factors, in particular:

   The last factor that has boosted the weight of Rapid Growth holdings has been share price performance, which 
we referenced above. Such significant gains, even when accompanied by fast revenue growth, do lead us to 
consider the balance of the portfolio and since early 2020 we have been looking to identify a more diverse set of 
exposures. These include the purchase of high-quality Stalwart companies which we had admired for a long time 
and where the pandemic sell-off provided an entry point. They are household names in adidas (branded 
sportswear), Estée Lauder (cosmetics) and S&P Global Inc (formerly Standard and Poors, a financial ratings 
agency).
   After a crisis, capital gets withdrawn from certain industries so we have sought out companies that can improve 
their market positions and emerge stronger. These include Lyft (ride sharing), Bookings Holdings (the dominant 
online travel agent), Rio Tinto (mining), and Wizz Air (a low-cost airline mainly operating in Eastern Europe). We 
have also added to Ryanair which the portfolio has owned for many years and will benefit from a further 
retrenchment of its competitors.
   The complete sales in the portfolio have made way for many of the stocks mentioned above. As well as selling 
Kirby and Orica with commodity exposure we also sold MRC Global and DistributionNOW (both suppliers to the 
energy industry), and Ferro-Alloy Resources (a Vanadium miner). We sold GrubHub and Just Eat Takeaway as we 
have settled on Doordash being the potential winner in food delivery. Sales also include companies whose shares 
have done well and are now more expensive in the context of their fundamentals such as earnings per share - 
Chipotle Mexican Grill, and Waters (scientific instruments).
   Governance and Sustainability
   The Chairman has referred to this important area. Our wider team has a dedicated Governance and Sustainability 
(G&S) analyst, and Baillie Gifford's broader research department has over twenty full time G&S personnel 
dedicated to engagement, research, and proxy voting. Our starting point is that we only buy companies that we feel 
have strong foundations and will need nudging towards even better standards rather than frequent or public 
criticism. We think it achieves more in the long term to tend to be a supportive shareholder, so we don't start with 
bad companies and plan to make them better.
Monks Investment Trust PLC Annual Financial -4-
   We want to back and encourage ambition amongst the companies that we own for you. This requires 
understanding of an individual company and the patience to engage. We get good access to management by being 
a supportive long-term holder who can hold significant stakes in companies. This access brings engagement, which 
in turn helps us encourage behaviours that support all stakeholders in a business. Just as we invest for the long 
term, we encourage the investee companies to do the same. We are prepared to be tough with companies and their 
management teams, continuing to own and engage rather than sell because they do not fit a narrow quantitative 
model which purports to measure Environmental, Social and Governance factors precisely.
   If corporate behaviour is not progressive, we will sell but only after engagement has been fulsome and clear. We 
have done this over the last 12-18 months with Jefferies Financial Group (formerly Leucadia) which we have 
ultimately sold. When we bought the company in 2015, we felt we had identified an investment bank with a 
management team which was much better aligned than the average in that industry. For example, by 2020 the CEO 
(Rich Handler) and President (Brian Friedman) had a combined 9% ownership and have never sold a share other 
than for charity purposes. During our ownership Jefferies had re-organised itself from a holding company into a 
purer-play investment bank. This generated value but the banking business was subject to rising costs 
(compensation) as the M&A cycle extended.
   One of our five core ESG beliefs is 'Long-term focused remuneration with stretching targets [2] '. When the 
remuneration committee saw fit to pay management cash bonuses despite missing a key target for ROE, we 
engaged with the committee chairperson. This call demonstrated a lack of independence, and when challenged it 
became apparent that the cash awards were partly to help the executives pay tax bills for unvested share awards. 
We opposed the re-election of the chairperson, and the compensation plan. The latter was 31% opposed and we 
sold the shares after the post pandemic recovery. Overall, Jefferies has not been a good investment and it shows 
the importance of corporate culture to the success of a business.
   A more encouraging engagement took place during the year with Service Corp International. As America's largest 
chain of undertakers, it was very much on the front line during the pandemic. This is a company we are still getting 
to know, having purchased it in 2018. Since then we have been engaging with the company and have good 
progress to report. We spoke to the CEO and CFO about changes to the proxy statement and the operational 
impact of Covid-19.
   In 2019, we requested greater board refreshment and changes to executive remuneration. The company has 
made progress on both fronts. Average director tenure has fallen from 24 to 16 years. A balance is being struck 
between fresh challenge and deep domain expertise. With regards to pay, we are delighted that they have 
introduced customer satisfaction metrics into the short-term remuneration plan and an above midcap-average 
return on equity trigger to the long-term incentive plan (LTIP). There remains more to go with the LTIP and we have 
asked for further recommendations to be put to the compensation committee.
   The discussion during the pandemic revealed the extraordinary steps Service Corp has taken in the fight against 
Covid-19. For example, it suspended all planned price increases, wishing to do right by society rather than pursue 
profit maximisation. We fully support this policy. Many industry participants are small, independent undertakers who 
are struggling to adapt - in some cases they 'stopped answering the phone'. Service Corp has stepped in, deploying 
assets and people to areas most in need. This conversation left us increasingly impressed at the culture of the 
organisation and the management team's care of staff, the communities they serve and the long-term sustainability 
of the business.
   Further examples of our engagement with companies can be seen in the Monks Stewardship Report 2020, which 
is available on the Company's page of the Baillie Gifford's website, under 'Documents' and 'Investment Intelligence'.
   Management Team
   In May 2020, we announced that Charles Plowden would retire from Baillie Gifford at the end of April 2021 which 
coincided with the Monks year end. Charles has been a fount of wisdom and wit for nearly four decades while at 
Baillie Gifford and was instrumental in the Monks portfolio changes since 2015 which have driven excellent returns 
and healthy demand for Monks shares. We are grateful for the many insights he has shared with us since we 
started working together on the Global Alpha team in 2005. Above all, he has made sure that we can sustain his 
legacy by leaving in place a team of diverse thinkers for the management of Monks Investment Trust.
   In anticipation of Charles' retirement, we have strengthened the team which supports the managers. That team 
was five people when we took on responsibility for Monks in 2015, and today it is seven. The new investment 
manager, Spencer Adair, has 21 years' experience. Deputy manager, Malcolm MacColl, has 22 years' experience 
and both have worked together as Monk's deputies for six years.

   Outlook
   We look forward not backwards, we expect change not stasis. It is understandable that many are alighting on the 
post-pandemic phase as a turning point for stock markets but we think it more likely that it accelerates the trends 
we are backing through careful stock selection. We are growth investors, we concede we have enjoyed a tailwind in 
the last few years but we also feel strongly that ambitious companies will continue to drive stock market returns and 
our focus should be on identifying those that have that potential.
   Each year we write the Monks Research Agenda, which shapes how we approach certain aspects of our 
research. Whilst bottom-up stock picking dominates our approach, the agenda can lead us on journeys that help us 
find the stocks that will generate long-term returns. This year we are continuing to focus on new areas that 
technology has not yet touched - healthcare, education, real estate and energy. We are also thinking of the next 
stage of development of online services; we referred to this above in our comments about the cloud being one of 
the most significant evolutions of the last forty years. We continue to look at ensuring companies do the right thing 
by society and trying to understand the implications of the great energy transition as solar and wind energy 
potentially drive energy costs down while at the same time allowing entities around the world to reach carbon 
neutral or zero carbon targets.
   Whilst these trends may endure for a decade or more, we remain pragmatic and opportunistic in shaping the 
portfolio around a range of growth companies that might prosper as cycles change. Above all, optimism is built into 
our DNA and we look forward to seeking the changes that can provide further profitable investments.

 03 March 2015
 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES EUR850M EURO BOND ISSUE AT 1.125% FIXED FOR 8 YEARS
 Ryanair today (3 March) announced that it has issued an 8 year, EUR850m Euro Bond at a fixed coupon of 
1.125%. This follows Ryanair's very successful debut issuance in June 2014 and secures further low cost financing 
for our 380 new Boeing 737 aircraft orders, deliveries of which started in September 2014.
 Ryanair is the world's most highly rated airline, with a BBB+ rating from both Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings. 
These ratings reflect the strength of Ryanair's business model which has a long established track record of 
profitability, cash generation, and a very strong balance sheet with low levels of debt.
 The bond will be listed on the Irish Stock Exchange which offers access to investors both in Europe and the rest of 
the world. The joint book runners were BNP Paribas, Citigroup, and Credit Agricole.
 Ryanair's Chief Financial Officer, Neil Sorahan, said:
 "We are pleased to have accessed the low cost Euro Bond markets again. Our EUR850m, 8 year, transaction was 
very keenly priced at a fixed coupon of 1.125%. The bond was more than 3 times oversubscribed, reflecting the 
strong demand from bond investors for Ryanair.
 This low cost finance, coupled with our attractively priced Boeing orders for 380 new Boeing 737 aircraft, will 
enable us to further reduce our aircraft ownership costs while continuing to offer the lowest fares and improving 
travel experience under our "always getting better" programme to our customers as we grow traffic from 90m 
customers p.a. this year to 160m p.a. by 2024."

Ryanair offer document contains nothing new
The Board of Aer Lingus has already unanimously rejected Ryanair's Offer, which
 significantly undervalues Aer Lingus and would see Ryanair build a monopoly of
 air transportation to and from Ireland. There is nothing new in today's
 document.
Colm Barrington, Chairman of Aer Lingus, said: "This document
Aer Lingus Group PLC Ryanair offer document contains nothing new
 contains nothing new. It is the usual stream of invective, spin and
 misrepresentation that we expect from the people at Ryanair. It also fails to
 address the recent EU prohibition decision which found emphatically that Ryanair
 wants to destroy consumer choice. It is a desperate last effort to create an
 airline monopoly in Ireland, and is clearly not in the interests of Aer Lingus
 shareholders and the travelling public. Aer Lingus is and will continue to be a
 strong independent airline. Ryanair clearly needs Aer Lingus but we do not need
 Ryanair."

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Operating and Financial Overview
Introduction
For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") all figures
 and comments are by reference to the adjusted income statement excluding the
 exceptional items referred to below.  A reconciliation of the results for the
 period under IFRS to the adjusted results is provided on page 13.
Exceptional items in the quarter ended June 30, 2010 amounted to EUR50.0m (pre
 tax) reflecting the estimated costs relating to the closure of airspace in April
 and May due to the Icelandic volcanic ash disruptions.  Exceptional items in the
 quarter ended June 30, 2009 amounted to EUR13.5m reflecting an impairment of the
 Aer Lingus shareholding.
Adjusted profit after tax excluding exceptional items increased by 1% to
 EUR138.5m.  Including exceptional items the profit after tax for the quarter
 amounted to EUR93.7m compared to a profit of EUR123.0m in the quarter ended June 30,
 2009.
Summary quarter ended June 30, 2010
Adjusted profit after tax increased by 1% to EUR138.5m compared to EUR136.5m in the
 quarter ended June 30, 2009 primarily due to a 5% increase in average fares,
 offset by a 34% increase in fuel costs.  Total operating revenues increased by
 16% to EUR896.8m as average fares rose by 5% due to an increase in average sector
 lengths.  Ancillary revenues grew by 23%, faster than the increase in passenger
 volumes, to EUR203.9m due to a combination of higher onboard spend (which was
 helped by longer sector length), improved product mix, increased take up of
Ryanair Holdings PLC First Quarter Results -7-
 priority boarding, and higher internet related revenues.  Total revenue per
 passenger as a result increased by 7%, whilst Load Factors remained flat at 83%
 during the quarter.
Total operating expenses rose by 17% to EUR727.4m, primarily due to an increase in
 fuel prices, the higher level of activity, and increased operating costs
 associated with the growth of the airline.  Fuel, which represents 39% of total
 operating costs compared to 35% in the comparative quarter, increased by 34% to
 EUR286.6m due to the increase in the price per gallon paid and an 18% increase in
 the number of hours flown.  Unit costs excluding fuel rose by 1% and including
 fuel they rose by 9%.  Operating margin decreased by 1 point to 19% whilst
 operating profit increased by 10% to EUR169.4m.
Adjusted net margin decreased from 18% to 15% at June 30, 2010 for the reasons
 outlined above.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were 9.36 cent compared to 9.26 cent
 in the comparative quarter ended June 30, 2009.
Balance sheet
 Total cash and cash equivalents increased by EUR259.4m since March 31, 2010 to
 EUR3,072.8m.  The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR274.6m which
 partially funded capital expenditure incurred during the period.  Capital
 expenditure of EUR331.6m largely consisted of advance aircraft payments for future
 aircraft deliveries and the delivery of 18 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft in the
 quarter.  Total debt, net of repayments, increased by EUR303.6m to EUR3,259.8m
 during the quarter.  Net debt at period end was EUR187.0m.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis quarter ended June 30, 2010
Adjusted profit after tax, increased by 1% to EUR138.5m primarily due to a 5%
 increase in average fares and longer sector lengths offset by higher fuel costs.
 Total operating revenues increased by 16% to EUR896.8m due to a 5% increase in
 average fares, a 14% increase in ancillary revenues per passenger, and an 8%
 increase in passenger numbers.  Fuel, which represents 39% of total operating
 costs compared to 35% in the comparative quarter, increased by 34% to EUR286.6m
 due to a higher price per gallon paid, and an increase in the number of hours

 profit increased by 10% to EUR169.4m.
Total operating revenues increased by 16% to EUR896.8m due to a 5% increase in
 average fares, an 8% increase in passenger traffic to 18.0m, and a 23% increase

   1. Accounting Policies
     The accounting policies followed in the preparation of these consolidated
     financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2005 are consistent with
     those set out in the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2004.
 2. Approval of the Preliminary Announcement
     The Board of Directors approved the preliminary announcement document, which
     will form the basis of the Group's consolidated financial statements for the
     year ended March 31, 2005 on May 27, 2005.
 3. Generally Accepted Accounting Policies
     The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results for the year ended March
     31, 2005 are based on the results reported under Irish and UK GAAP.
 4. Aircraft retirement costs
     Six aircraft were retired earlier than projected in 2003 due to the
     detection of scratch marks ('scribing') that occurred during an
     aircraft painting programme on these aircraft in 1995. It had been
     determined that the cost of repairing these aircraft was uneconomic
     due to the short remaining life of the aircraft. Accordingly the
     Company had determined that the residual value of US$1m (EUR794k) for
     these aircraft was excessive and as a result reduced it to EUR250k per
     aircraft. The cost of this adjustment charge for five aircraft was
     reflected in the results for the quarter ended September 30,2003,
     and the charge for a sixth aircraft was expensed in quarter ended
     December 31, 2003.

Ryanair Holdings PLC
27 February 2008
                       RYANAIR COMPLAINS TO EU COMMISSION
        AGAINST EUR400M STATE AID TO AMSTERDAM AIRPORT AND KLM / AIR FRANCE
Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (Wednesday, 27th February 2008),
filed a complaint with the European Commission against State aid of over EUR400
million per annum to Schiphol Airport and to KLM / Air France. This State aid is
being granted by the Dutch Government in the form of an exemption of transfer
passengers from the so-called "ECO-TAX" on air travel.
Announcing this complaint, Ryanair's Jim Callaghan said:
        "The Dutch Government's so-called "ECO-TAX" on air travel is clearly a
         tax scam to fill a EUR350 million hole in Holland's annual budget.
         Additionally, the Dutch Government is exempting transfer passengers from
         this tax, which amounts to massive subsidy to Schiphol Airport and KLM /
         Air France. While Schiphol is effectively the only Dutch airport
         handling transfer passengers, KLM / Air France accounts for 95% of the
         transfer traffic at the airport. This tax exemption is almost
         exclusively benefiting Schiphol and the KLM / Air France monopoly. The
         Dutch Council of State in September 2007 confirmed that it should have
         been notified to the European Commission as State aid.
        "At a time when the Commission's biased application of the State aid
Ryanair Holdings PLC Complaint to EU Commission
         rules is increasingly more apparent, we have little hope that the
         Commission will actually investigate this matter. Ryanair has lodged
         complaints regarding massive illegal subsidies to Air France, Lufthansa,
         Alitalia and other flag carriers, yet the Commission has failed to take
         any action whatsoever in these cases (some of which are almost 3 years
         old). Instead the Commission is persecuting tiny regional airports like
         Alghero, Pau, Lubeck, Schonefeld, Aarhus and Tampere, for commercial
         deals with low fares airlines to grow their traffic and promote
         competition.
        "It is time the Commission got its priorities right and started
         promoting competition and consumer choice. We are calling on the
         Commission to stop ignoring blatant State aid to Air France, Alitalia,
         Olympic, Lufthansa, Volare and now KLM, and to finally take on national
         governments who continue to distort competition in Europe's air
         transport market with billions of euro of illegal, back door State aid
         to their flag carrier airlines. The Commission should require the Dutch
         Government to either scrap this tax or to apply it to all passengers,
         i.e., both point-to-point and transfer at Schiphol, and end this EUR400
         million subsidy to KLM / Air France".

 Autocascade will offer remarketing systems and services to the automotive industry. This will enable fleet owners, 
including ourselves, to maximise yield on vehicle disposals through higher residual values and lower distribution 
costs. Autocascade is designed to leverage the significant development potential of the B2B market - initially in the 
UK, but with plans for European expansion.
 The exceptional charge of Euro 3.6 million relates to yourautochoice.com and this restructuring of our interests in 
the on-line remarketing of motor vehicles.
 Centrus (3 Arrows)
 Our 3 Arrows subsidiary, which accounts for approximately 4% of Group revenues, was repositioned earlier this 
year to operate within the Association of British Insurers third party hire initiative which provides a framework for the 
services charged at lower rates but faster settlement. Following agreements reached earlier this year, the detailed 
process of settlement of historic debt is progressing and levels are expected to reduce significantly by the end of 
the year. Recently rebranded Centrus, a number of major new accounts were secured during the first half and 
trends in monthly hire starts have increased an average of 37% in the 3 months to end August 2001.
 Summary and outlook
 "Despite extremely challenging market conditions, the Group continued to achieve double-digit revenue growth in 
key markets except Germany. The German market remains difficult and we continue to focus on improving yield, 
together with actions to further reduce costs. Underlying Group operating margins remained strong and actions to 
contain fleet costs are beginning to deliver benefits.
 Revenue growth trends in the first half have continued into the peak months of July and August, despite weakness 
in the US economy and slowing European GDP growth. Although general economic uncertainty remains, we expect 
these levels of growth to continue for the balance of the year, assuming no further marked deterioration in the 
economic environment.

Aer Lingus response to announcement by Office of Fair Trading
Dublin & London, 29 October 2010:  Aer Lingus welcomes today's announcement by
 the Office of Fair Trading (the "OFT") that it intends to investigate Ryanair's
 minority shareholding in Aer Lingus under the UK's merger control legislation.
This investigation follows confirmation by the EU General Court in its decision
 earlier this year that, while the EU Merger Regulation does not give the EU
 Commission power to address such minority shareholdings, individual Member
 States remain free to apply their national competition law to Ryanair's
 shareholding.
Aer Lingus will cooperate in full with the OFT in this investigation.

            RYANAIR CALLS ON EU TO STOP AIR FRANCE BID FOR ALITALIA
                    UNTIL EUR2.7BN ILLEGAL STATE AID IS REPAID
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Thursday, 6th December 2007)
called on the European Commission to block Air France's bid for Alitalia until
both airlines have paid back a combined EUR2.7bn in illegal state aid received
from the French and Italian Governments.
Two years ago, Ryanair filed two separate State Aid complaints with the European
Commission about EUR1bn illegal state aid given to Air France in the form of
discounted domestic passenger charges and EUR1.7bn illegal state aid given to
Alitalia in the form of debt write offs. Despite these flagrant breaches of
state aid rules, the European Commission has failed to act on either case in the
last two years.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC CALL ON EU TO STOP AF BID
        "The European Commission's failure to address these serious state aid
         complaints shows that it has one set of rules for high fare flag carrier
         airlines and another for efficient low fare airlines like Ryanair. We
         call on the European Commission to block Air France's bid for Alitalia
         until such time as these two state aid complaints have been addressed
         and the combined EUR2.7bn in illegal state aid is repaid".

                         ULSTER SAYS 'NO' TO HIGH FARES
              RYANAIR ANNOUNCES 23rd BASE AT BELFAST CITY AIRPORT
                        100,000 FREE* SEATS TO CELEBRATE
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Thursday, 6th September 2007)

October, Ryanair will base a $70m brand new Boeing 737-800 aircraft at BCA which
will operate a new four times daily service to London Stansted and a new 2nd
daily service from Belfast to Liverpool.
The arrival of Ryanair's low fares will end the high fare stranglehold imposed
by British Midland and Easyjet on the people of Belfast. From October 30th,
passengers will save both money and time with Ryanair as they enjoy the lowest
fares and the best punctuality from Belfast's central airport. Ryanair
Ryanair Holdings PLC 23rd BASE AT BELFAST AIRPORT
guarantees the lowest fares from any Belfast airport to any London airport. If
passengers find a lower fare with any other airline, Ryanair will pay double the
difference. Only Ryanair GUARANTEES the lowest fares.

Speaking at Belfast City Airport today, Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary said:
        "We are delighted to announce Belfast City Airport as our 23rd European
         base. The airport approached us last week following the departure of the
         high fare Air Berlin and we are happy to step into the gap and deliver
         really low fares for Belfast. In the coming year, 600,000 passengers
         will fly Ryanair to and from Belfast for less than half the price of BMI
         and Easyjet's high fares. These visitors will generate a tourism spend
         of over GBP100m, which will sustain 600 local jobs.
        "Ulster has repeatedly said 'No' to high fares, well from 30th October
         next Ulster can say 'hello' to GBP10 fares with Ryanair. 100,000 free*
         seats are available on these new routes for immediate booking on
         www.ryanair.com (just GBP10 including taxes and charges) and we urge all
         passengers to book straight away as demand for Northern Ireland's lowest
         fares guaranteed will be huge".
Brian Ambrose, Chief Executive of George Best Belfast City Airport said:
        "I'm delighted to welcome this Ryanair base aircraft to Belfast City
         Airport and to announce that Ryanair will be offering flights to
         Stansted. This additional commitment to Belfast City Airport means we
         will offering more choice to passengers traveling to London.
         Additionally, we welcome Ryanair's intention to expand the European
         route portfolio from this base. Great news for the economy and tourism
         in Northern Ireland."

 It is extraordinary for the Aer Lingus board to claim that Ryanair's Offer "significantly undervalues" 
Aer Lingus when Ryanair's EUR2.80 offer per share represents a 27% premium to the EUR2.20 per share 
valuation which the board of Aer Lingus agreed just 8 days previously.
 Minister Cullen's statement 6th October 2006
 Taking just a few of the points made by Minister Cullen in his statement, Ryanair responds as
 follows:
 (a)          "...I do not consider that the Government's and Ireland's strategic objectives would be well 
served by a takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair."
 Ryanair believes that its proposal represents Aer Lingus' best opportunity to remain an Irish 
headquartered, managed, controlled and regulated airline, fully focused on Irish strategic objectives. 
Ryanair's Offer clearly meets the Government's strategy by securing the future of Aer Lingus, retaining 
the Heathrow slots and Aer Lingus' branding. Ryanair's Offer - if accepted - will establish one strong 
Irish airline group (as there is in the UK (BA), Germany (Lufthansa) and France (Air France)) which 
clearly meets Ireland's strategic objectives.
 (b)           "The IPO means that Aer Lingus is better positioned than ever in the past, to grow and 
develop
 its business and to minimise the opportunities for competitors."
 If Ryanair's Offer fails, Aer Lingus will continue to be under the de facto control of the Government and 
unions. Given this Government's track record on aviation and transport issues generally (ranging from the 
state monopolies of Dublin Airport Authority, Dublin Bus, and CIE and all points between) this will mean 
that the dead hand of anti-competitive, monopolistic and anti-consumer policies continues to drag down Aer 
Lingus. Ryanair finds it unusual that the Minister now confirms that the rationale for the IPO of Aer 
Lingus was to "minimise the opportunities for competitors".
 (c)           "Delivering a single airline group as Ryanair suggests will not deliver the benefits to the 
Irish
 consumer that Ryanair has suggested."
 This claim is without foundation given that Ryanair's Offer, if successful, commits it to reducing Aer 
Lingus' fares by 21/2% per year for a minimum period of 4 years and reducing the fuel surcharge, both of 
which are clearly of benefit to, and have the support of, consumers.
 (d)           ".consumer interests are best served by having a variety of product offerings that meet the
 requirements of different segments of the market and our policy in respect of airlines and airports
 has been developed to deliver this and to facilitate flexibility and choice for the consumer."
Ryanair Holdings PLC Key Elements of Offer Doc -2-
 Ryanair's Offer for Aer Lingus guarantees that Aer Lingus and Ryanair will continue to be run and managed 
separately, serving different market segments, with different product offerings. The combination of 
Ryanair and Aer Lingus will still find it difficult to advance consumer interests when dealing with 
uncompetitive monopolies, such as the DAA, which are owned, protected and operated by the Minister for 
Transport. The DAA currently proposes to increase passenger charges by 60% at Dublin Airport.
 (e)           "The Ryanair low-cost model has transformed the aviation experience for consumers and 
nowhere more than Ireland."
 For all of the reasons set out in this announcement and as our proven track record clearly demonstrates, 
Ryanair believes that our generous offer for Aer Lingus will ensure that Aer Lingus' customers will in 
future enjoy and benefit from our plan to lower fares and improve services in a stand alone, separately 
managed Aer Lingus.
 Ryanair's Cash Offer delivers excellent value for Aer Lingus' Shareholders whilst ensuring that the price 
on offer is one which will enable Ryanair to continue to realise its objective of developing Aer Lingus, 
lowering fares and advancing the best interests of Irish and European consumers.
 Full details of the Cash Offer, including the terms and conditions under which it is being made, will be 
posted to Aer Lingus shareholders on Monday next, 23(rd) October 2006.  The Cash Offer is conditional, 
amongst other things, upon acceptances being received in respect of more than 50% of the Aer Lingus Shares 
the subject of the Offer, including any Aer Lingus Shares beneficially owned or controlled by Ryanair.
 Full details for enquiries are printed at the end of this announcement:
 THE RYANAIR CASH OFFER
 Ryanair's generous cash offer
 1.         EUR2.80 is an excellent offer
 Ryanair's Offer of EUR2.80 in cash per Aer Lingus Share values Aer Lingus Group plc at approximately 
EUR1.481bn compared to its flotation value of EUR1.163bn just 8 days prior to Ryanair's Offer.
 2.         27% premium in just 1 week
 The Offer represents a premium of approx 27% over the IPO price of Aer Lingus (EUR2.20) which was agreed 
as an appropriate value by the Government of Ireland, the Board of Aer Lingus, the ESOT and their 
respective advisers, on 27 September - just 8 days prior to Ryanair's Offer.
 3.         Ryanair's bid is supporting an inflated share price
 If the Offer is not accepted, there is a likelihood that the share price of Aer Lingus will fall 
significantly. During the two days (Mon 2nd and Tue 3rd October) when Ryanair was not actively buying in 
the market, the Aer Lingus share price fell from EUR2.48 to EUR2.44, and from EUR2.44 to EUR2.41.
 4.         Government to realise over EUR500m
 If the Offer is accepted, the Irish Government will realise a total of over EUR500m from the sale of its 
stake in Aer Lingus, an enormous return from an airline which was, by its own admission, on the edge of 
bankruptcy just four years ago.
 5.         Aer Lingus employees realise an average of over EUR60k each - tax free structure for ESOT
 If the Offer is accepted, Aer Lingus employees stand to realise over EUR220m, which equates to an average 
of over EUR60,000 per employee, and there is a mechanism which would allow ESOT Members to realise the 
proceeds of the shares held by the ESOT on a tax free basis.
 6.         Volatile earnings record of Aer Lingus
 Aer Lingus is an airline with a volatile earnings record which came close to bankruptcy four years ago, 
and whose cumulative losses (EUR616m) exceeded its cumulative profits (EUR433m) over the past 14 years by 
over EUR180m.  Aer Lingus' earnings prospects will be enhanced by acceptance of the Ryanair Offer.
 7.         Ryanair's Offer will not lead to a monopoly
 Ryanair's Offer commits to maintaining Aer Lingus as a stand-alone separate airline. The two airlines 
will compete vigorously, therefore this will not lead to a monopoly. Aer Lingus' IPO document confirms 
that there is little crossover because Ryanair and Aer Lingus only compete on about 17 of more than 500 
combined routes (Source: IPO Prospectus, p79).
 Whilst Ryanair and Aer Lingus together account for 61% of aircraft movements at Dublin Airport, this is 
not dissimilar to other large airline groupings at other European airports. For instance, SAS and its 
Lufthansa partners have over 85% of seats in Copenhagen, Austrian and its Lufthansa partners have over 70% 
of movements in Vienna, Olympic has over 73% of seats in Athens, TAP and its Star Alliance Partners have 
60% of seats in Lisbon, Air France and its Sky Team Associates have 62% of movements in Charles de Gaulle, 
and Lufthansa and its Star Alliance Partners have 67% of movements in Munich.
 In addition, Dublin continues to be served by over 50 other scheduled airlines currently serving 112 
international destinations, each of which is free to open new routes and increase services at Dublin 
should they so wish. Some of these airlines are significantly larger than the Ryanair/Aer Lingus 
combination would be (e.g. British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France/KLM). Moreover, these airlines can be 
joined by other airlines who wish to enter or grow the market as Ryanair continues to do.
 8.         Good for competition and good for consumers
Ryanair Holdings PLC Key Elements of Offer Doc -2-
 During the 6 months to 30 June 2006, Aer Lingus' average short haul fare increased by 2% to EUR86.49. 
This is in line with Aer Lingus' stated strategy to "Maximise Passenger Revenues" (Source: IPO Prospectus, 
p71). Similarly, Aer Lingus has recently refused to reduce its fuel surcharge despite recent falls in oil 
prices (Source: Irish Independent, 4 October 2006). Rising fares and high fuel surcharges are bad for 
competition and bad for consumers.
 By contrast, Ryanair's Offer guarantees to reduce Aer Lingus' short haul fares by 2.5% per year for a 
minimum period of 4 years and to reduce Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges as oil prices fall. Lower fares and 
lower surcharges will be good for consumers. Ryanair's Offer will therefore increase competition and lower 
prices which is good for consumers and should stimulate growth.
 YOUR ALTERNATIVE (IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE CASH OFFER)
 AER LINGUS FACES AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE AS A SMALL REGIONAL AIRLINE
 IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET WITH A HIGH FARE STRUCTURE
 AND AN UNCOMPETITIVE COST BASE.
 SUSTAINABILITY OF AER LINGUS PROFITABILITY IS UNCERTAIN
 1.     Aer Lingus' short haul fares are uncompetitive
 Aer Lingus' average short haul fare of EUR87.55 is hopelessly uncompetitive in the face of Ryanair's 
average equivalent of EUR41.23. As a result, Aer Lingus has seen its share of traffic between Ireland and 
the UK collapse in recent years as highlighted in the table below.

 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated adjusted profit/ (loss) after tax of 
the Company for the year. This measure excludes the effects of certain income and expense items, which are 
unusual, by virtue of their size and incidence, in the context of the Company's ongoing core operations, such as the 
impairment of a financial asset investment, accelerated depreciation related to aircraft disposals and Icelandic 
volcanic ash related costs.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and, as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, inter-segment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset class comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed across 
the Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment operations. In addition, 
as the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and liabilities have been allocated to the 
Company's single reportable segment.
 There have been no changes to the basis of segmentation or the measurement basis for the segment profit or loss 
since the prior year.
 Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

(a) Icelandic volcanic ash related costs of EUR26.1 million reflect the estimated costs relating to the closure of 
airspace in April and May 2010 due to the Icelandic volcanic ash disruptions. The closure of European airspace in 
April and May 2010, due to the Icelandic volcanic ash disruption, resulted in the cancellation of 9,400 Ryanair 
flights. The impact on the Group's operating results totaled EUR29.7 million, (before associated tax of EUR3.6 
million) for the year ended March 31, 2011, comprising EUR15.6 million of operating expenses and EUR1.7 million 
of finance expenses attributable to the period of flight disruption, together with estimated passenger compensation

costs of EUR12.4 million pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004 ('EU261'). The Company's estimate of total 
passenger compensation costs has been determined based on actual claims received and processed to date 
together with probable future compensation payments and other related costs.

 ===========  ===========  ===========
Non-flight scheduled revenue arises from the sale of rail and bus tickets, hotel reservations, car hire and other 
sources, including excess baggage charges and administration fees, all directly attributable to the low-fares 
business.
 All of the Company's operating profit arises from low-fares airline-related activities, its only business segment. The 
major revenue earning assets of the Company are its aircraft, which are registered in Ireland and therefore all 
profits accrue principally in Ireland. Since the Company's aircraft fleet is flexibly employed across its route network 
in Europe, there is no suitable basis of allocating such assets and related liabilities to geographical segments.

13.     Share buy-back
 There were no share buy-backs in the period.  In the period ended September 30, 2013, the Company bought 
back 24.1m ordinary shares at a total cost of EUR176.6m.  This was equivalent to approximately 1.7% of the 
Company's issued share capital.  All ordinary shares repurchased were cancelled.  Accordingly, share 
capital decreased by 24.1m ordinary shares with a nominal value of EUR0.2m and the capital redemption 
reserve increased by a corresponding EUR0.2m.  The capital redemption reserve is required to be created 
under Irish law to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.

PRESS RELEASE
06 May 2004
April Traffic Figures
The number of flights handled by National Air Traffic Services last month
increased by 7.8 per cent to 173,558 from 160,951 in April 2003, the UK's
leading air traffic control provider reported today.
All areas of NATS' business showed strong increases in April, with domestic
flights up 4.7 per cent, international arrival/departures up 8.7 per cent and
overflights up 9.2 per cent
However, some of the year-on-year gains are misleading. Figures for April 2003
reflected the start of the war in Iraq, and the grounding of the Buzz fleet
following its take-over by Ryanair.

average sector length and the strengthening of the sterling exchange rate
against the euro whilst higher US$ fuel prices were partly offset by the
strength of the euro exchange rate against the US$.
Staff costs have increased by 11% to EUR35.2m primarily reflecting an increase in
average employee numbers to 2,595 and the impact of pay increases of 3% granted
during the period, offset by the lower level of productivity based pay as
sectors flown increased by 9%.
Depreciation and amortisation decreased by 10% to EUR21.3m. A higher depreciation
charge due to an increase in the size of the 'owned' fleet from 56 to 60, offset
by a lower amortisation charge due to the retirement of 737-200 aircraft and the
positive impact of a new engine maintenance deal on the cost of amortisation of
737-800 aircraft. The strengthening of the euro to US$ also had a positive
impact on the depreciation and amortisation charge.
Fuel costs rose by 42% to EUR61.9m due to an increase in the number of sectors
flown, a 10% increase in sector length, and a higher average US$ cost per gallon
of fuel offset by the positive impact of the strengthening of the Euro to the US

dollar during the period.
Maintenance costs decreased by 2% to EUR10.8m reflecting the improved reliability
arising from the higher proportion of 737-800 operated and a lower level of
maintenance costs incurred due to the return of four BAE 146 aircraft to KLM
earlier in the year.
Marketing and distribution costs increased by 53% to EUR3.5m due to a higher
promotional spend, and increased costs associated with the higher level of
activity.
Aircraft rental costs increased by EUR5.9m to EUR8.2m reflecting the increased costs
arising from the lease of ten 737-800 aircraft which were delivered in the
quarter to March 31, 2004 offset by the return of four BAE 146s to KLM.
Route charges increased by 25% to EUR34.7m due to an increase in the number
sectors flown, an increase in the average sector length and an increase in the
weight of the aircraft operated (which incur a higher charge), and the negative
impact of the strengthening of sterling against the Euro.
Airport and handling charges increased by 23% slightly more than the increase in
passenger volumes due to increased costs at certain existing airports offset by
lower costs at new airports, and the adverse impact of the strength of the
sterling exchange rate against the euro during the period.
Other expenses increased by 22% to EUR25.9m, which is less than the growth in
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some new and existing products,
and cost reductions achieved on indirect costs.
Operating margins have remained very robust at 41% although they were 1% lower
than last year, due to the reasons outlined above which has resulted in
Operating profits increasing by 14% to EUR170.7m during the quarter.
Interest receivable has increased by EUR0.7m due to the combined impact of higher
levels of cash and liquid resources and an improvement in average deposit
interest rates earned in the quarter compared to last year.
Interest payable increased by EUR1.6m due to the drawdown of debt to part fund the
purchase of new aircraft.

                       Notes to the Financial Statements
 1. Accounting Policies
     The accounting policies followed in the preparation of these consolidated
     financial statements for the half year ended September 30, 2004 are
     consistent with those set out in the financial statements for the year ended
     March 31, 2004.
 2. Approval of the Financial Statements
     The Audit Committee approved the consolidated financial statements for the
     Half year ended September 30, 2004 on October 29th, 2004.
 3. Generally Accepted Accounting Policies
     The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results for the Half year ended
     September 30, 2004 are based on the results reported under Irish and UK
     GAAP.
 4. Aircraft retirement costs
     Five aircraft were retired earlier than projected in 2003 due to the
     detection of scratch marks ('scribing') that occurred during an aircraft
     painting programme on these aircraft in 1995. It had been determined
     that the cost of repairing these aircraft was uneconomic due to the
     short remaining life of the aircraft. Accordingly the Company had
     determined that the residual value of US$1m(EUR794k) for these aircraft
     was excessive and as a result reduced it to EUR250k per aircraft. The cost
     of this adjustment charge was reflected in the results for Quarter ended
     September 30, 2003.
Independent review report by KPMG to Ryanair Holdings plc
Introduction
We have been instructed by the company to review the financial information set
out on pages 1 to 7 and we have read the other information contained in the
interim report and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with the financial information.
Directors' responsibilities
The interim report, including the financial information contained therein, is
the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors. The directors
are responsible for preparing the interim report in accordance with the Listing
Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange which require that the accounting policies and
presentation applied to the interim figures should be consistent with those
applied in preparing the preceding annual accounts except where they are to be
changed in the next annual accounts in which case any changes, and the reasons
for them, are to be disclosed.
Review work performed
We conducted our review in accordance with guidance contained in Bulletin 1999/
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 's Half Year Results -5-
4: Review of interim financial information issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. A review consists principally of making enquiries of group management and
applying analytical procedures to the financial information and underlying
financial data and, based thereon, assessing whether the accounting policies and
presentation have been consistently applied unless otherwise disclosed. A review
is substantially less in scope than an audit performed in accordance with
Auditing Standards and therefore provides a lower level of assurance than an
audit. Accordingly we do not express an audit opinion on the financial
information.
Review conclusion
On the basis of our review we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial information as presented for the six months
ended 30 September 2004.

Body
 The Group is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, including 
scheduled services, car hire, internet income and related sales to third parties. The Group operates a single fleet of 
aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided to the 
CEO, who is the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource allocation decisions the 
CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation decisions are made based on the 
entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in type.  The objective in 
making resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial results, rather than individual routes 
within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated profit/(loss) after tax of the 
Group for the period.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Group has a single reportable segment, 
intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Group's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed across the 
Group's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment operations.  In addition, as the 
Group is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and liabilities have been allocated to the Group's 
single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

 Acquisitions and disposals
 Capital expenditure in the year to March, 2015 amounted to EUR788.5m and primarily relates to aircraft 
pre delivery payments, 11 aircraft deliveries and delivery of 5 new spare engines.
 12.     Financial instruments and financial risk management
 We are exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. Our financial risk 
exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The 
Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 These preliminary financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2014 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --   Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the 
Group can access at the measurement date.
 --   Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that asset 
or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --   Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 Fair value estimation
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --   Available for sale: The fair value of available for sale financial assets is their quoted market bid 
price at the balance sheet date. (Level 1)
 --   Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash-flow analyses have been used to determine the 
fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
 --   Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and carbon swaps: A comparison of the 
contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at March 31, 2015 has 
been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -6-
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the year to March 31, 2015, there were 
no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy 
used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 Financial instruments disclosed at fair value
 --   Fixed-rate long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at March 31, 2015 to arrive at 
a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
 There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the period to March 
31, 2015 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.
 The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial balance sheet, are as follows:
At Mar    At Mar                  At Mar
 31,       31,       At Mar        31,

7.2   The minimum price which may be paid for any such share shall be an amount
 equal to the nominal value thereof;
7.3   The maximum price which may be paid for any such share shall be an amount

Not for release, publication or distribution, in whole or in part, in or into or
  from Australia, Canada, Japan, South Africa or the United States or any other
                 jurisdiction where it would be unlawful to do so
                             FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
                       STATEMENT BY AER LINGUS GROUP PLC
The statement issued by Ryanair Holdings plc at 4.39pm yesterday, Thursday 26th
October 2006, contains a number of serious inaccuracies and misrepresentations.
Specifically, its assertion that its conditional offer for Aer Lingus "equates
to an average of over EUR60,000 per employee, with a tax free option for ESOT
members" is incorrect and seriously misleading.
The facts are that the Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) has approximately
4,665 members. After allowing for the ESOT's borrowings, the offer is worth an
average of approximately EUR32,500 per ESOT member. This inaccuracy had been drawn
to the attention of Ryanair.
Aer Lingus Group PLC Ryanair inaccuracies re ESOT
This purported tax-free status is highly conditional, dependent on Revenue
approval and, extraordinarily, dependent on Aer Lingus employees and former
employees going into the public markets and buying shares in Ryanair, a company
whose stock has under-performed other European airlines during 2006.
The numerous misrepresentations by Ryanair will be dealt with in full when Aer
Lingus issues its response to Ryanair's conditional offer.

 "That the Company and/or any subsidiary (as such expression is defined by Section 155 of the Companies 
Act, 1963) of the Company be and they are hereby generally authorised to make market purchases and/or 
overseas market purchases (as defined by Section 212 of the Companies Act, 1990) of the Company's Ordinary

bid on the trading venue where the purchase is carried out, as stipulated by Article 5(1) of Commission 
Regulation (EC) (No. 2273/2003) of December 22, 2003 implementing the Market Abuse Directive (EC) (No. 
6/2003) as regards exemptions for buy-back programmes and stabilisation of financial instruments; and
 B.            105% of the average of the Relevant Price for such Ordinary Shares of the same class for 
each of the five (5) business days immediately preceding the day of the purchase of the Ordinary Shares; 
and
 (iv)          For the purpose of sub-paragraph (iii)(B), "Relevant Price" means, in respect of the 
purchase of shares traded on the Irish Stock Exchange Limited (or any successor thereto) ("ISE"), the 
official closing price of such shares as published in the ISE Daily Official List, or in respect of the 
purchase of shares traded on the London Stock Exchange plc (or any successor thereto) ("LSE"), the 
official closing price of such shares as published in the LSE Daily Official List, or if on any business 
day there shall be no dealing of shares on the trading venue where the purchase is carried out, the 
Relevant Price shall be determined by such other method as the Directors shall determine, in their sole 
discretion, to be fair and reasonable;
 (v)           For the purpose of sub-paragraph (iii)(B), "Relevant Price" means, in respect of the 
purchase of Ordinary Shares underlying American Depositary Shares traded on NASDAQ, on any business day on 
which there shall be a dealing in ADSs on NASDAQ (or any successor thereto), one-fifth of the NASDAQ 
Official Close Price in respect of such ADSs as published by NASDAQ (or its equivalent if such a price is 
no longer published by NASDAQ) and, or if on any business day there shall be no dealing of shares on the 
trading venue where the purchase is carried out, the Relevant Price shall be determined by such other 
method as the Directors shall determine, in their sole discretion, to be fair and reasonable;
 (vi)          This authority will expire on the earlier of the date of the next Annual General Meeting or 
15 months from the date of the passing of this resolution, unless previously varied, revoked or renewed in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 215 of the Companies Act 1990. The Company or any subsidiary may 
before such expiry enter into a contract for the purchase of Ordinary Shares which would or might be 
wholly or partly executed after such expiry and may complete any such contract as if the authority 
conferred hereby had not expired."

Body
 To manage these risks, Ryanair uses various derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, foreign 
currency forward contracts and commodity contracts. These derivative financial instruments are generally held to 
maturity. The Company enters into these arrangements with the goal of hedging its operational and balance sheet 
risk. However, Ryanair's exposure to commodity price, interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations cannot 
be neutralised completely.
 Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative 
financial instruments continue to be re-measured to fair value, and changes therein are accounted for as described 
below.
 The fair value of interest rate swaps is computed by discounting the projected cash flows on the Company's swap 
arrangements to present value using an appropriate market rate of interest. The fair value of forward foreign 
exchange contracts and commodity contracts is determined based on the present value of the quoted forward price. 
Recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
 Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised 
asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative 
financial instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income (in the cash flow hedging reserve on the balance 
sheet). When the hedged forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the 
cumulative gain or loss is removed from other comprehensive income and included in the initial measurement of 
that asset or liability. Otherwise the cumulative gain or loss is removed from other comprehensive income and 
recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction. The ineffective part of any hedging 
transaction and the gain or loss thereon is recognised in the income statement immediately.
 When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the underlying hedged transaction is still 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in other comprehensive income and is 
recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is 
recognised in the income statement immediately.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -65-
 Where a derivative financial instrument hedges the changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an 
unrecognised firm commitment, any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement. 
The hedged item is also stated at fair value in respect of the risk being hedged, with any gain or loss also being 
recognised in the income statement.
 Inventories
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on invoiced price on an average 
basis for all stock categories. Net realisable value is calculated as the estimated selling price arising in the ordinary 
course of business, net of estimated selling costs.
 Trade and other receivables and payables
 Trade and other receivables and payables are stated on initial recognition at fair value plus any incremental direct 
costs and subsequently at amortised cost, net (in the case of receivables) of any impairment losses, which 
approximates fair value given the short-dated nature of these assets and liabilities.
 Cash and cash equivalents
 Cash represents cash held at banks and available on demand, and is categorised for measurement purposes as 
"loans and receivables."
 Cash equivalents are current asset investments (other than cash) that are readily convertible into known amounts 
of cash, typically cash deposits of more than one day but less than three months at the date of purchase. Deposits 
with maturities greater than three months are recognised as short-term investments, are categorised as loans and 
receivables and are carried initially at fair value and then subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective-
interest method.
 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
 All loans and borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, being the fair value of the consideration received, net of 
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, non-current interest-bearing loans are measured at 
amortised cost, using the effective interest yield methodology.
 Leases
 Leases under which the Company assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as 
finance leases. Assets held under finance leases are capitalised in the balance sheet, at an amount equal to the 
lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments, and are depreciated over their 
estimated useful lives. The present values of the future lease payments are recorded as obligations under finance 
leases and the interest element of a lease obligation is charged to the income statement over the period of the 
lease in proportion to the balances outstanding.
 Other leases are operating leases and the associated leased assets are not recognised on the Company's balance 
sheet. Expenditure arising under operating leases is charged to the income statement as incurred. The Company 
also enters into sale-and-leaseback transactions whereby it sells the rights to an aircraft to an external party and 
subsequently leases the aircraft back, by way of an operating lease. Any profit or loss on the disposal where the 
price achieved is not considered to be at fair value is spread over the period during which the asset is expected to 
be used. The profit or loss amount deferred is included within "other creditors" and divided into components of 
greater than and less than one year.
 Provisions and contingencies
 A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of 
a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation. If the 
effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future outflow at a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
 The Company assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to contingencies, including legal matters, as well 
as probable losses. We record provisions for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred 
and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of 
the obligation will only be confirmed by future events, or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured 
with reasonable reliability. Provisions are re-measured at each balance sheet date based on the best estimate of 
the settlement amount.
 In relation to legal matters, we develop estimates in consultation with internal and external legal counsel taking into 
account the relevant facts and circumstances known to us. The factors that we consider in developing our legal 
provisions include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and number of other similar current and 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -65-
past litigation cases, the nature of the subject matter of the litigation, the likelihood of settlement and current state of 
settlement discussions, if any.
 Segment reporting
 Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal organisational and management 
structure and the internal reporting information provided to the chief operating decision maker, who is responsible 
for allocating resources and assessing performance of operating segments. The Company is managed as a single 
business unit that provides low fares airline-related services, including scheduled services, and ancillary services 
including car hire services, and internet and other related services to third parties, across a European route 
network.
 Income statement classification and presentation
 Individual income statement captions have been presented on the face of the income statement, together with 
additional line items, headings and sub-totals, where it is determined that such presentation is relevant to an 
understanding of our financial performance, in accordance with IAS 1, "Presentation of Financial Statements".
 Expenses are classified and presented in accordance with the nature-of-expenses method. We disclose separately 
on the face of the income statement, within other income and expense, losses on the impairment of available-for-
sale financial assets and gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment. The nature of the 
Company's available-for-sale asset is that of a financial investment; accordingly any impairment of the investment is 
categorised as finance expense and included in other income/(expense) as a separate line item. The presentation 
of gains or losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment within other income/(expense) accords with 
industry practice.
 Revenues
 Scheduled revenues comprise the invoiced value of airline and other services, net of government taxes. Revenue 
from the sale of flight seats is recognised in the period in which the service is provided. Unearned revenue 
represents flight seats sold but not yet flown and a provision for government tax refund claims attributable to 
unused tickets, and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Revenue, net of government taxes, is 
released to the income statement as passengers fly. Unused tickets are recognised as revenue on a systematic 
basis, such that twelve months of time expired revenues are recognised in revenue in each fiscal year. 
Miscellaneous fees charged for any changes to flight tickets are recognised in revenue immediately.

Reconciliation of results for the year under IFRS to adjusted results for the
 year ended March 31, 2010
The condensed consolidated preliminary income statement for year ended March 31,
 2010, as set forth on page 5 of this preliminary announcement, presents the
 results for the year separately between pre-exceptional and exceptional items.
 Certain items are presented separately, as exceptional items, which, by virtue
 of their size or incidence, are unusual in the context of the Group's ongoing
 core operations, as we believe this presentation represents the underlying
 business more accurately and reflects the manner in which investors typically
 analyse the results.
In the current year we have presented an impairment of a financial asset
 investment as an exceptional item.  Any amounts deemed "exceptional" for
 management discussion and analysis purposes have been classified for the
 purposes of the IFRS income statement in the same way as non exceptional amounts

Length: 345 words
Body
 As disclosed in note 1 - basis of preparation, the annual consolidated financial
 statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with International
 Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') as issued by the International Accounting
 Standards Board and as adopted by the European Union ('EU').  The condensed
 consolidated interim financial statements included in this half-yearly financial
 report have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, "Interim Financial
 Reporting," as adopted by the EU.
Our responsibility
Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed
 consolidated interim financial statements in the half-yearly financial report,
 based on our review.
Scope of review
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review
 Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information
 Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity issued by the Auditing
 Practices Board for use in Ireland and the UK.  A review of interim financial
 information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for
 financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review
 procedures.  A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
 accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -15-
 consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware
 of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.  Accordingly,
 we do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe
 that the condensed consolidated interim financial statements in the half-yearly
 financial report for the six months ended September 30, 2010 are not prepared,
 in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted by the EU, the
 Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and the Transparency Rules
 of the Republic of Ireland's Financial Regulator and the Disclosure and
 Transparency Rules of the UK FSA.

Body
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 
was 10.8% (June 30, 2015: 11.8%).  The tax charge for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 of EUR31.0M (June 
30, 2015: EUR32.7M) comprises a current tax charge of EUR29.0M and a deferred tax charge of EUR2.0M 
relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment recognised in the income 
statement.
 5.            Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR1.5M is the fair value of various share options 
granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in accordance with 
employee services rendered.
 6.            Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.            Capital commitments
 At June 30, 2016 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 353 (2015: 315) Boeing 737-800NG aircraft.  The Group 
agreed to purchase 183 new Boeing 737-800NG aircraft from the Boeing Corporation during the periods Fiscal 
2015 to Fiscal 2019 of which 11 aircraft were delivered in the year ended March 31, 2015, a further 41 
were delivered in the year ended March 31, 2016 and 16 in the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
 The Group also agreed to purchase up to 200 (100 firm and 100 options) Boeing 737 Max 200 aircraft from 
the Boeing Corporation during the periods Fiscal 2020 to Fiscal 2024.
 8.            Analysis of operating segment
 The Group is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car-hire, internet income and related sales to third parties. The Group 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided 
to the CEO, who is the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource allocation 
decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data. However, resource allocation decisions are made 
based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -5-
type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial 
results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the adjusted profit/(loss) after tax of the 
Group for the period.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Group has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Group's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed 
across the Group's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment 
operations.  In addition, as the Group is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and 
liabilities have been allocated to the Group's single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

 Acquisitions and disposals
 Capital expenditure in the quarter to June 30, 2016 amounted to EUR381.4M and primarily relates to 
aircraft pre delivery payments and 16 aircraft deliveries
 11.          Financial instruments and financial risk management
 The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 These interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2015 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the period.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -5-
 --      Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that 
the Group can access at the measurement date.
 --         Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that 
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --         Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 Fair value estimation
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
 11.          Financial instruments and financial risk management (continued)
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --        Available for sale: The fair value of available for sale financial assets is their quoted 
market bid price at the balance sheet date. (Level 1)
 --         Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to determine 
the fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
 --       Derivatives - currency forwards, aircraft fuel contracts and carbon swaps: A comparison of the 
contracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at March 31, 2016 has 
been used to establish fair value. (Level 2)
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the quarter to June 30, 2016, there 
were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 Financial instruments disclosed at fair value
 --           Fixed-rate long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been 
discounted at the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at June 30, 2016 
to arrive at a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
 There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the quarter to June 
30, 2016 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Third Quarter -7-
 Operating and Financial Overview
Introduction
For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") all figures
 and comments are by reference to the adjusted income statement excluding the
 exceptional items referred to below.  A reconciliation of the results for the
 period under IFRS to the adjusted results is provided on page 8.
Exceptional items in the nine month period December 31, 2008 amounted to
 EUR136.5m consisting of a EUR93.6m impairment of the Aer Lingus shareholding and an
 accelerated depreciation charge of EUR42.9m on aircraft to be disposed in the
 financial years 2008/9 and 2009/10.
Adjusted profit excluding exceptional items decreased by 74% to EUR113.1m in the
 nine months ended December 31, 2008. Including exceptional items the loss for
 the period amounted to EUR23.4m compared to a profit of EUR454.8m in the nine month
 period ended December 31, 2007.
 Summary nine month period ended December 31, 2008
Profit after tax decreased by 74% to EUR113.1m compared to EUR442.6m in the nine
 month period ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to a 91% increase in fuel
 costs.  Total operating revenues increased by 14% to EUR2,415.1m, slower than the
 17% growth in passenger volumes, as average fares declined by 5%, due to the
 absence of Easter in the period, lower baggage penetration rates, the combined
 impact of the movement in sterling/euro exchange rates and the aggressive fare
 promotions.  Ancillary revenues grew by 25% to EUR454.0m during the period.  Total
 revenue per passenger as a result decreased by 3%, whilst the Load
 Factor remained flat during the period at 84%.
Total operating expenses increased by 40% to EUR2,270.6m, primarily due to the
 increase in fuel prices, the higher level of activity, and increased costs,
 associated with the growth of the airline.  Fuel, which represents 49% of total
 operating costs compared to 36% in the previous period, increased by 91% to
 EUR1,116.5m due to the increase in the price per gallon and an increase in the
 number of hours flown, offset by a positive movement in the US dollar exchange
 rate versus the euro.  Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 5% and including fuel
 they rose by 20%.  Operating margins fell by 18 points to 6% whilst operating
 profit decreased by 71% to EUR144.5m.
Net margins fell from 21% at December 31, 2007 to 5% for the reasons outlined
 above.
Earnings per share for the period was 7.65 cent compared to 29.14 cent in the
 previous period ended December 31, 2007.
Gross cash decreased by EUR355.0m primarily due to the reduction in profitability
 arising from the increase in fuel costs. The Group generated cash from operating
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Third Quarter -7-
 activities of EUR46.6m and a further EUR169.6m of delivery proceeds arising from the
 sale of eight Boeing 737-800 aircraft which part funded a EUR46.0m share buy back
 programme and capital expenditure incurred during the period.  Capital
 expenditure of EUR401.8m largely consisted of advance aircraft payments for future
 aircraft deliveries and the delivery of twelve new Boeing 737-800 aircraft.
 Long term debt, net of repayments, decreased by EUR119.7m during the period.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis nine month period ended December 31, 2008
Adjusted profit after tax, decreased by 74% to EUR113.1m primarily due to higher
 fuel costs.  Total operating revenues grew by 14% due to a 17% increase in
 passenger numbers and the strong growth in ancillary revenues compared to the
 period ended December 31, 2007. This was partially offset by a decrease in fares
 due to the absence of Easter, lower baggage penetration rates, the adverse
 impact of the movement in sterling and aggressive fare promotions.  The growth
 in revenues was offset primarily by increases in fuel prices, which rose by 91%
 to EUR1,116.5m.  Operating margins, as a result, fell by 18 points to 6%,
 whilst operating profit decreased by 71% to EUR144.5m.
Total operating revenues increased by 14% to EUR2,415.1m, slower than the 17%
 increase in passenger volumes to 45.7m.  Total revenue per passenger decreased
 by 3% due to the 5% fall in average fares.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 11% to EUR1,961.2m reflecting a 17% rise
 in traffic due to increased passenger numbers on existing routes and the
 successful launch of new routes and bases. This is offset by a 5% decrease in
 average fares due to the absence of Easter, lower baggage penetration rates and
 the adverse impact of the movement in sterling to the euro.Load factor remained
 flat at 84%, compared to the period ended December 31, 2007.
Ancillary revenues continue to outpace the growth of passenger volumes and rose
 by 25% to EUR454.0m.  This performance reflects the growth of onboard sales,
 non-flight scheduled revenues, and other ancillary products.
Total operating expenses rose by 40% to EUR2,270.6 primarily due to the 91%
 increase in fuel prices, the higher level of activity, and the increased costs
 associated with the growth of the airline.
Staff costs increased by 10% to EUR234.9m.  Excluding the one off charge of EUR7.0m,
 for a staff share option grant, in the prior year period ended December 31,
 2007, staff costs increased by 14%.  This primarily reflects a 26% increase in
 average employee numbers to 6,347. Cabin crew, who earn lower than the average
 salary, accounted for the vast majority of the increase.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 19% to EUR147.5m. This reflects, net of
 disposals, an additional 12 aircraft or a 19% increase in the weighted average
 number of lower cost 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this period compared to the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Third Quarter -7-
 period ended December 31, 2007.
Fuel costs rose by 91% to EUR1,116.5m due to the higher cost of fuel in the period
 and an 18% increase in the number of hours flown.
Maintenance costs increased by 20% to EUR49.6m due to a 17% increase in the number
 of leased aircraft from 35 to 41 and increased costs arising from the growth of
 line maintenance activity at new bases.  These increases were partially offset
 by a stronger euro versus US dollar exchange rate during the period.
Marketing and distribution costs decreased by 41% to EUR9.3m due to tight control
 on expenditure and the increased focus on internet based promotions.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 4% to EUR57.5m, which is lower than the 17%
 increase in the number of leased aircraft from 35 to 41 compared to the period
 ended December 31, 2007 reflecting the positive impact of lower lease rental
 rates obtained and the impact of a stronger euro versus US dollar exchange rate.
Route charges rose by 13% to EUR218.0m due to an increase in the number of sectors
 flown offset by the positive impact of a stronger euro versus sterling.
Airport and handling charges increased by 14% to EUR344.5m due to the 17% increase
 in passenger volumes, offset by lower costs at new airports and bases launched
 and savings achieved on handling costs.

Not for release, publication or distribution, in whole or in part, in or into or
  from Australia, Canada, Japan, South Africa or the United States or any other
                 jurisdiction where it would be unlawful to do so
                             FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
                  REJECTION BY AER LINGUS OF RYANAIR PROPOSAL
The Board of Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus Group") notes the announcement by
Ryanair Holdings plc ("Ryanair Holdings") of its intention to make an
unsolicited offer for the whole of the issued and to be issued ordinary share
capital of Aer Lingus Group not already owned by Ryanair Holdings at a price of
EUR2.80 per share (the "Offer"). The Board unanimously rejects the Offer.
Aer Lingus is one of Europe's most profitable airlines, with a consistent track
record for generating strong returns on its capital. It is well-positioned to
benefit from numerous growth opportunities relating to both its long and short
haul networks as a result of its strong market position in Ireland and the depth
Aer Lingus Group PLC Rejection of Ryanair Proposal
and experience of its management team.
The Board's detailed views will be sent to shareholders when the formal offer
document has been issued. In the meantime, Aer Lingus Group shareholders are
strongly advised to take no action in relation to the Offer.
Commenting on the Offer, John Sharman, Chairman of Aer Lingus Group, said: "This
approach is unsolicited, wholly opportunistic and significantly undervalues the
Group's businesses and attractive long term growth potential. In addition, the
Offer would raise significant regulatory issues as a result of Aer Lingus
Group's strong position in its core markets."

 LaudaMotion is not included in this guidance.  We hope to increase our investment from 24.9% to 75% over the 
coming weeks having just received EU competition approval to do so. However, current trading for LaudaMotion 
has been adversely impacted by lower than expected S.2018 fares due to the late release of LaudaMotion 
schedules, and considerable damage caused by Lufthansa who have refused to pay invoices, delivered 9 instead of 
14 aircraft at lease rates that are substantially above market rates, and recently attempted to trigger a contract 
termination so it could give these aircraft to a competitor airline, Eurowings, in a clear breach of Lufthansa's 
competition commitments to the EU following its purchase of Air Berlin. In addition, LaudaMotion faces substantial 
cost headwinds especially in fuel, where it is unhedged and exposed to recent higher oil prices of close to $80pbl. 
We now expect LaudaMotion will lose approx. EUR150m in its first very difficult year, but these results will improve 
substantially to break even by year 3 of operations."

 RYANAIR WELCOMES PROPOSED IAG -VUELING MERGER
 MIRRORS EARLIER BA/BMI & CURRENT RYANAIR/AER LINGUS OFFER
 Ryanair, Europe's only ultra low fares airline, today (12 Nov) welcomed the announcement by IAG/Iberia 
that it intends to acquire Vueling, as the consolidation of Europe's airlines continues.
 This latest airline merger mirrors the EU Commission's Phase 1 approved merger of IAG/British Airways 
with British Midland (in the UK) in March 2012, Aegean's recent takeover offer for Olympic in Greece and 
Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus, which is currently being reviewed by the EU Competition Authorities.
 IAG's announcement that it is to cut 4,500 jobs at Iberia further demonstrates the changing landscape of 
Europe's aviation industry and the need for continuing restructuring and reform among Europe's high fares 
former flag carriers who, like Aer Lingus, cannot survive as independent airlines.
 Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
 "The merger of IAG Iberia and Vueling is another logical merger of EU airlines operating in the same 
market and mirrors IAG/British Airways takeover of BMI in the UK earlier this year, Aegean's offer for 
Olympic in Greece and Ryanair's current offer for Aer Lingus in Ireland.
 As Europe's flag carrier airlines continue to consolidate Ryanair believes that its offer for Aer Lingus 
should be approved by the EU Competition Authorities if they follow - fairly - the precedent set in the 
BA/BMI merger and last weeks takeover of Vueling in Spain by BA/IAG.  These are all inevitable steps in 
the consolidation process of Europe's high fares former flag carrier airlines."

Aer Lingus Group PLC
23 October 2006
Not for release, publication or distribution, in whole or in part, in or into or
  from Australia, Canada, Japan, South Africa or the United States or any other
                 jurisdiction where it would be unlawful to do so
                             FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
                    REJECTION BY AER LINGUS OF RYANAIR OFFER
The Board of Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus") notes the publication of the
offer document by Ryanair Holdings plc ("Ryanair") making its offer to purchase
the whole of the issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Aer Lingus
not already owned by Ryanair (the "Offer").
The Board of Aer Lingus, which has already rejected the Offer, will formally
respond in detail when it issues its response setting out the views of the
Participating Directors on the Offer within the next fourteen days. In the
meantime, Aer Lingus shareholders are strongly urged to take no action in
relation to the Offer.
Aer Lingus Group PLC Rejection of Ryanair Offer
Aer Lingus is one of Europe's most profitable airlines, with a consistent track
record for generating strong returns on its capital. It is well positioned to
benefit from numerous growth opportunities relating to both its long and short
haul networks as a result of its strong market position in Ireland and the depth
and experience of its management team.
Commenting on the Offer, John Sharman, Chairman of Aer Lingus, said: "The Offer
from Ryanair is without merit. It fails to recognise the unique position of the
Group's businesses, its outstanding track record and its excellent growth
prospects. The Offer also ignores the significant regulatory issues that a
combination would face. A takeover by Ryanair, no matter how it is dressed up,
would be bad for Aer Lingus, for its shareholders, for its employees and for
consumers."

Operating margins fell by 4 points to 8% due to the reasons outlined above and
operating profits have decreased by 23% to EUR44.2m during the quarter.
Interest receivable has increased by 44% to EUR21.4m for the quarter primarily due
to the increase in average deposit rates earned in the period, offset somewhat
by a lower average cash balance.
Interest payable increased by 22% to EUR25.3m due to the drawdown of further debt
to part finance the purchase of new aircraft and the adverse impact of higher
interest rates.
Foreign exchange losses during the period of EUR3.5m are primarily due to the
negative impact, on foreign currency deposits, of changes in the US dollar and
sterling exchange rate against the euro.
Gains on disposal of property, plant and equipment of EUR13.7m arose on the sale
of 5 Boeing 737-800 aircraft.
Statement of the directors in respect of the nine month financial report
We confirm our responsibility for the nine month financial statements and that
to the best of our knowledge:
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-
* the condensed set of financial statements comprising the condensed income
statement, the condensed statement of recognised income and expense, the
condensed balance sheet and the related notes have been prepared in accordance
with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting;
* the interim management report includes a fair review of the information
required by:
(a) Regulation 8(2) of the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations
2007, being an indication of important events that have occurred during the
first nine months of the financial year and their impact on the condensed set of
financial statements; and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties
for the remaining three months of the year; and
(b) Regulation 8(3) of the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations
2007, being related party transactions that have taken place in the first nine
months of the current financial year and that have materially affected the
financial position or performance of the entity during that period; and any
changes in the related party transactions described in the last annual report
that could do so.
The Group's auditors have not reviewed these condensed financial statements.

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
Notes
1. Reporting entity
Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The
condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the nine
months ended December 31, 2007 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries
(together referred to as the "Group").
The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the year ended
March 31, 2007 are available at www.ryanair.com
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-
2. Statement of compliance
These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the
interim financial statements") have been prepared in accordance with
International Accounting Standard No. 34 ("IAS 34") "Interim Financial
Reporting". They do not include all of the information required for full annual
financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent
published consolidated financial statements of the Group.
The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2007 do not
constitute statutory financial statements of the Group within the meaning of
regulation 40 of the European Communities (companies, group accounts)
regulations, 1992. Statutory financial statements for the year ended March 31,
2007 have been filed with the companies' office. The auditors' report on these
financial statements was unqualified.
The Audit Committee approved the interim financial statements for the nine
months ended December 31, 2007 on February 1, 2008.
3. Significant accounting policies
Except as stated otherwise below, this quarter's financial information has been
prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most
recent published consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS").
4. Generally Accepted Accounting Policies
The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results (Operating and Financial
Overview) for the nine months ended December 31, 2007 and the comparative nine
months are based on the results reported under the Group's IFRS accounting
policies.
5. Estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual
results may differ from these estimates.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-
Except as described below, in preparing these consolidated financial statements,
the significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting
policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those
that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
During the period ended December 31, 2007 management reassessed its estimates of
the recoverable amount of aircraft residual values following certain recent and
forward aircraft disposals and trends in the market.
6. Seasonality of operations
The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to
quarter, and management expects these variations to continue. Among the factors
causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to general
economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Accordingly the first
half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
7. Income tax expense
The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the
nine months ended December 31, 2007 was approximately 11 percent, in line with
the same period last year.
8. Capital and reserves
Share buy back programme.
The Company commenced a share buy back programme in June 2007 and 59.5m shares,
at an approximate cost of EUR300m, have been purchased and cancelled. This
represents approximately 3.8% of the pre existing share capital of the Company.
9. Share based payments
The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most
recent published consolidated financial statements. In June 2007 a further grant
on similar terms was made to eligible employees, with a consequent charge to the
income statement in the period of approximately EUR9.1m.
10. Contingencies
The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its
business. The Group does not believe that any such litigation will individually
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-
or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
Group. Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, management
believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not
expected to materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or
financial position.
11. Capital commitments
During the nine months ended December 31, 2007 the Group announced the purchase
of 27 additional Boeing 737-800s. This brings Ryanair's total firm orders for
B737-800s to 308 and the total fleet size (net of planned disposals) to 262 by
2012. These additional aircraft are due for delivery in financial year ending
March 31, 2010.
12. Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
The following table sets out the movement in available for sale financial assets
 in the nine month period.
                                                                          EUR'000
                                                                        -------
 Balance at April 1, 2007                                               406,075
 Purchase of equities                                                    57,990
 Net change in fair value                                              (138,587)
                                                                     ----------
 Balance at December 31, 2007                                           325,478
                                                                     ----------
As of December 31, 2007 the average cost per share of Aer Lingus was EUR2.52 and
the market value was EUR2.09, a decline of 17%. Accordingly the view at this time
under accounting rules is that this is neither "significant" nor "prolonged", in
particular because there has been a recovery in the share price post period end,
and therefore no impairment loss has been recorded.
However in the event that the asset becomes impaired the difference between the
cost of the shares and the market value is recorded as an impairment loss in the
profit and loss. At December 31, 2007 this amounted to EUR77.4m and on February 1,
2008 this had fallen to EUR41.6m. The Group will review this matter at the end of
each quarter.
13. Post balance sheet events
There were no significant post balance sheet events.
14. Loans and borrowings
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-

 Balance at December 31, 2007                                         2,068,999

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Operating and Financial Overview
Introduction
For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") all figures
 and comments are by reference to the adjusted income statement excluding the
 exceptional items referred to below. A reconciliation of the results for the
 period under IFRS to the adjusted results is provided on page 15.
Exceptional items in the nine month period ended December 31, 2009 amounted to
 EUR13.5m reflecting an impairment of the Aer Lingus shareholding recorded in the
 quarter to June 30, 2009. Exceptional items in the nine month period ended
 December 31, 2008 amounted to EUR136.5m consisting of an impairment of the Aer
 Lingus shareholding of EUR93.6m and an accelerated depreciation charge of EUR42.9m
 on aircraft disposed in financial years 2009 and 2010.
Adjusted profit after tax excluding exceptional items increased by EUR263.0m to
 EUR376.1m. Including exceptional items the profit after tax for the nine months
 amounted to EUR362.6m compared to a loss of EUR23.4m in the nine month period ended
 December 31, 2008.
 Summary nine months ended December 31, 2009
Adjusted profit after tax increased by EUR263.0m to EUR376.1m compared to EUR113.1m in
 the nine month period ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to a 40% decrease in
 fuel costs, partially offset by a 16% decline in average fares. Total operating
 revenues decreased by 2% to EUR2,378.7m as average fares fell by 16% due to the
 recession, price promotions, and the adverse impact of the movement in

 euro/sterling exchange rates. Ancillary revenues grew by 7% to EUR485.7m, lower
 than the increase in passenger volumes, due to a decline in average spend per
 passenger primarily due to lower excess baggage revenues, and the negative
 impact of the movement in euro/sterling exchange rates. Total revenue per
 passenger as a result decreased by 14%, whilst the Load Factor remained flat at
 84% during the period.
Total operating expenses fell by 15% to EUR1,924.7m, primarily due to lower fuel
 prices, offset by the higher level of activity and increased operating costs
 associated with the growth of the airline. Fuel, which represents 35% of total
 operating costs compared to 49% in the comparative period, decreased by 40% to
 EUR666.4m due to the fall in the price per gallon paid offset by an increase in
 the number of hours flown. Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 5% and including
 fuel they fell by 26%. Operating margin increased by 13 points to 19% whilst
 operating profit increased by EUR309.5m to EUR454.0m.
 Net margins increased to 16% from 5% at December 31, 2008 for the reasons
 outlined above.
 Adjusted earnings per share for the period were 25.48 cent compared to 7.65 cent
 in the previous nine month period ended December 31, 2008.
 Balance sheet
 Total cash and cash equivalents remained strong at EUR2,439.7m.
 The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR409.2m and a further
 EUR93.3m delivery proceeds on the sale of four Boeing 737-800 aircraft (and two
 spare engines) which partially funded capital expenditure incurred during the
 period. Capital expenditure of EUR593.5m largely consisted of advance aircraft
 payments for future aircraft deliveries and the delivery of 32 new Boeing
 737-800 aircraft in the period. Total debt, net of repayments, increased by
 EUR242.1m to EUR2,640.5m during the period. Net debt at period end was EUR200.8m.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis nine month period ended December 31, 2009
Adjusted profit after tax, increased by EUR263.0m to EUR376.1m primarily due to
 lower fuel costs, partially offset by a 16% decline in average fares. Total
 operating revenues decreased by 2% to EUR2,378.7m as average fares fell by 16% due
 to the recession, price promotions, the adverse impact of the movement in
 euro/sterling exchange rates and a decline in ancillary revenues per passenger,
 offset by a 15% increase in passenger numbers. Fuel, which represents 35% of
 total operating costs compared to 49% in the prior period comparative, decreased
 by 40% to EUR666.4m due to the fall in the price per gallon paid offset by an
 increase in the number of hours flown. Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 5% and
 including fuel they fell by 26%.  Operating margin, as a result, increased by 13
 points to 19%, whilst operating profit increased by EUR309.5m to EUR454.0m.

 Keywords Studios, the international technical services provider to the global video games industry is pleased to

UK Court of Appeal granting a stay on the Office of Fair Trading's ("OFT") investigation into Ryanair's 
minority shareholding in Aer Lingus.  The stay has been granted pending the resolution of Ryanair's 
substantive appeal against the decision of the Competition Appeal Tribunal of 28(th) July which found that

                  RYANAIR STILL GUARANTEES NO FUEL SURCHARGES
                HIGH FARES AIRLINES CONTINUE TO PENALISE CONSUMERS
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Tuesday, 12th October 2004)
re-iterated its promise of NO FUEL SURCHARGES as Europe's high fares airlines
continue to penalise ordinary consumers with yet more fuel surcharges. In the
last week, BA, Air France, Lufthansa, Hapag Lloyd Express and Germania have
added even MORE fuel surcharges to consumers.
Speaking this morning, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
        "Ryanair is committed to delivering Europe's lowest fares to ordinary
         European consumers every day, and we are committed to NO FUEL
         SURCHARGES, not today, not tomorrow, not ever. High fare airlines
         continue to penalise ordinary consumers with more fuel surcharges and
         even higher fares.
        "It is no wonder millions of consumers are choosing Ryanair and are
         voting with their feet, because only Ryanair offers passengers Europe's
         lowest fares, unbeatable punctuality and customer service and GUARANTEED
         no fuel surcharges".

Exceptional items
 The Company presents certain items separately, which are unusual, by virtue of their size and incidence, 
in the context of our ongoing core operations, as we believe this presentation represents the underlying 
business more accurately and reflects the manner in which investors typicallyanalyse the results. Any 
amounts deemed "exceptional" for management discussion and analysis purposes, in the Chairman's Report and 
Chief Executive's Report, have been classified for the purposes of the income statement in the same way as 
non-exceptional amounts of the same nature.
 Exceptional items in the year ended March 31, 2012 relates to a one-off release of ticket sales revenue 
of EUR57.8 million, net of tax, due to a change in accounting estimates relating to the timing of revenue 
recognition for unused passenger tickets which were made as a result of the availability of more accurate 
and timely data obtained through system enhancements. Exceptional items in the year ended March 31, 2011 
amounted to EUR26.1 million reflecting the estimated costs relating to the closure of airspace in April 
and May 2010 due to the Icelandic volcanic ash disruptions.
 Adjusted profit after tax excluding exceptional items increased by 25% to EUR502.6 million compared to 
adjusted profit after tax in the year ended March 31, 2011. Including exceptional items the profit after 
tax for the year increased by 50% to EUR560.4 million compared to a profit of EUR374.6 million in the year 
ended March 31, 2011.
 Summary year ended March 31, 2012
 Adjusted profit after tax increased by 25% to EUR502.6 million compared to EUR400.7 million in the year 
ended March 31, 2011 primarily due to a 16% increase in average fares and strong ancillary revenues, 
offset by a 30% increase in fuel costs. Total operating revenues increased by 19% to EUR4,324.9 million as 
average fares rose by 16%. Ancillary revenues grew by 11%, faster than the 5% increase in passenger 
numbers, to EUR886.2 million due to an improved product mix and higher internet related revenues. Total 
revenue per passenger, as a result, increased by 13%, whilst Load Factor decreased by 1 point to 82% 
during the year.
 Total operating expenses increased by 19% to EUR3,707.0 million, primarily due to an increase in fuel 
prices, the higher level of activity and operating costs associated with the growth of the airline. Fuel, 
which represents 43% of total operating costs compared to 39% in the prior year, increased by 30% to 
EUR1,593.6 million due to the higher price per gallon paid and an 11% increase in the number of hours 
flown. Unit costs excluding fuel increased by 6% and sector length adjusted, they remained flat.  
Including fuel, unit costs rose by 13%.   Operating margin remained flat at 14% whilst operating profit 
increased by 20% to EUR617.9 million.
 Adjusted net margin was up one point to 12% compared to March 31, 2011.
 Adjusted earnings per share for the year were 34.10 euro cent compared to adjusted basic earnings per 
share of 26.97 euro cent at March 31, 2011.

 EUR140m p.a. and repeated restructurings have led to pay cuts and job losses with
 no substantial benefit as operating costs per passenger have risen by 18% in
 just 2 years. Aer Lingus is now suffering load factor declines, and has recently
 announced capacity reductions and forecast operating losses in 2008 and again in
 2009.
Ryanair's merger proposal today offers Ireland a better future by:-
- delivering over EUR325m in cash to the Irish government, the ESOT and Aer Lingus
 employees
 - guaranteeing that Aer Lingus will remain a separate company with a special
 brand
 - securing Heathrow slots and their connectivity for Ireland at lower fares
 - doubling of Aer Lingus' short haul fleet to 66 aircraft within 5 years,
 creating over 1000 associated new jobs in Aer Lingus
 - cutting Aer Lingus' short haul fares by 5% for 3 years, saving consumers over
 EUR40m annually
 - removing Aer Lingus' long haul fuel surcharges, saving consumers over EUR100m
 annually
 - creating an Irish national champion in the airline sector with a growing
 pan-European and transatlantic network
 - assuring Aer Lingus' future in one of the EU's Big Four airline groups (Air
 France/KLM, British Airways Group, Lufthansa/Swiss & Aer Lingus/Ryanair)
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer -2-
We have today requested early meetings with the Irish Ministers for Finance and
 Transport, the Board of Aer Lingus, and Aer Lingus's ESOT trustees to highlight
 the benefits for Ireland and all other stakeholders of this comprehensive and
 valuable merger proposal."

 the best of the knowledge and belief of the directors of Ryanair and Coinside

This document includes certain 'forward looking statements' with respect to the
 business, strategy and plans of Ryanair and Aer Lingus and their respective
 expectations relating to the Cash Offer and their future financial condition and
 performance. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements
 about Ryanair or Aer Lingus or Ryanair's management's beliefs and expectations,
 are forward looking statements. Words such as 'believes', 'anticipates',
 'estimates', 'expects', 'intends', 'aims', 'potential', 'will', 'would',
 'could', 'considered', 'likely', 'estimate' and variations of these words and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer -2-
 similar future or conditional expressions are intended to identify forward
 looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such
 statements. By their nature, forward looking statements involve risk and
 uncertainty because they relate to events and depend upon future circumstances
 that may or may not occur.
 Examples of such forward looking statements include, but are not limited to,
 statements about expected benefits and risks associated with the Cash Offer,
 projections or expectations of profit attributable to shareholders, anticipated
 provisions or write-downs, economic profit, dividends, capital structure or any
 other financial items or ratios; statements of plans, objectives or goals of
 Ryanair or the combined business following the Cash Offer; statements about the

 levels and demographic trends and any impact that those matters may have on
 Ryanair or the combined group following the Cash Offer; statements concerning
 any future Irish, UK, US or other economic environment or performance;
 statements about strategic goals, competition, regulation, regulatory approvals,
 dispositions and consolidation or technological developments in the financial
 services industry; and statements of assumptions underlying such statements.
 Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the plans,
 objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions expressed in such forward
 looking statements made by  Ryanair or Aer Lingus or on their behalf include,
 but are not limited to, general economic conditions in Ireland, the United
 Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere; regulatory scrutiny, legal proceedings
 or complaints; changes in competition and pricing environments; the inability to
 hedge certain risks economically; the adequacy of loss reserves; the ability to
 secure new customers and develop more business from existing customers; the Cash
 Offer not being completed or not being completed as currently envisaged;
 additional unanticipated costs associated with the Cash Offer or the operating
 of the combined group; or an inability to implement the strategy of the combined
 group or achieve the Cash Offer benefits set out in this announcement.
 Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
 forward looking statements are set out in the most recent annual reports and
 accounts of Ryanair and Aer Lingus, including Ryanair's most recent annual
 report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC.
 Forward-looking statements only speak as of the date on which they are made, and
 the events discussed in this announcement may not occur. Subject to compliance
 with applicable law and regulation, neither Ryanair nor Coinside undertakes any
 obligation to update publicly or revise forward-looking statements, whether as a
 result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 Any person who is the holder of 1 per cent. or more of any class of shares in

21 Pensions
 The Company accounts for pensions in accordance with IAS 19, "Employee Benefits."
 The Company operates defined-benefit and defined-contribution schemes.
 Defined-benefit schemes
 The Company funds the pension entitlements of certain employees through defined-benefit plans. Two plans are 
operated for eligible Irish and UK employees. In general, on retirement, a member is entitled to a pension calculated 
at 1/60th of the final pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service, subject to a maximum of 40 years. 
These plans are fully funded on a discontinuance basis and the related pension costs and liabilities are assessed in 
accordance with the advice of a professionally qualified actuary. The investments of the plans at March 31, 2011 
consisted of units held in independently administered funds. The most recent full actuarial valuations of the plans 
were carried out at January 1, 2008 in respect of the UK plan and December 31, 2009 in respect of the Irish plan, in 
accordance with local regulatory requirements using the projected unit credit method, and the valuation reports are 
not available for public inspection.
 A separate annual actuarial valuation has been performed for the purposes of preparing these financial statements. 
The principal actuarial assumptions used for the purpose of this actuarial valuation were as follows:

sheet commentary below) all figures and comments are by reference to the adjusted results excluding the 
exceptional items referred to below.  A reconciliation of the results for the period under IFRS to the 
adjusted results is provided in note 9 of this half-yearly financial report.
 The exceptional item in the half-year ended September 30, 2015 comprised the gain of EUR317.5M arising on 
the disposal of Ryanair's 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus.

September 30, 2015.  Including the exceptional item the profit for the half-year amounted to EUR1,405.7M.
 Financial Review Half-Year Ended September 30, 2015
 Income Statement
 Scheduled revenues:
 Scheduled revenues rose by 16% to EUR3,240.0M due to 13% traffic growth to 58m and a 2% increase in 
average fare to EUR56.
 Ancillary revenues:
 Ancillary revenues rose by 8% to EUR800.1M due to 13% traffic growth, partially offset by a one-time 
benefit in the prior year comparative arising from the earlier loading of the Summer 15 schedules and the 
result of Hertz ending their car-hire partnership (on short notice) at the beginning of Jul-15.
 Operating Expenses:
 Fuel and oil:
 Fuel and oil fell by 1% to EUR1,157.0M due to lower euro fuel prices per gallon in the period.
 Airport and handling charges:
 Airport and handling charges rose by 15% to EUR469.6M due to 13% traffic growth, the addition of more 
primary airports to the network and stronger sterling against the euro.
 Route charges:
 Route charges increased by 11% to EUR349.4M due to a 7% increase in sectors flown and Eurocontrol price 
increases in France, Germany and the UK.
 Staff costs:
 Staff costs were up 15% to EUR305.7M due to a 7% increase in sectors flown, the impact of a 2% pay 
increase in Apr-15 and stronger sterling against the euro.
 Depreciation:
 Depreciation increased by 10% to EUR215.1M due to 21 additional aircraft (269 at Sep-15 v 248 at Sep-14), 
the purchase of 5 spare engines and higher levels of heavy maintenance activity.
 Marketing, distribution and other:
 Marketing, distribution and other rose by 20% to EUR149.0M, due mainly to costs related to the French ATC 
strike in Apr-15 (approx. EUR5M), accelerated spend (timing) of our marketing budget due to the opening up 
of new routes and bases and higher on-board sales.
 Maintenance, materials and repairs:
 Maintenance, materials and repairs decreased by 3% to EUR62.8M due to lower unscheduled maintenance than 
last year and positive currency hedging.
 Aircraft rentals:
 Aircraft rentals increased by 17% to EUR71.0M due to the longer duration of short-term summer leases 
compared to the prior year comparative.
 Unit costs excluding fuel remained flat, including fuel they fell by 6%.
 Other income/(expense)
 Gain on disposal of available for sale financial asset:
 The Group disposed of its 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus for EUR2.50 per share resulting in an 
exceptional gain of EUR317.5M primarily due to the reclassification of unrealised gains from other 
comprehensive income and reserves to the income statement. The investment had previously been impaired to 
EUR0.50 per share in prior periods.
 Finance expense:
 Finance expense fell by 8% to EUR34.8M due to lower interest rates.
 Finance income:
 Finance income rose by 9% to EUR14.0M primarily due to higher cash balances.
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash rose by EUR400.8M to EUR5,196.7M since Mar-15.
 Gross debt fell by EUR210.9M to EUR4,220.7M in the period.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -5-
 EUR967.2M cash flow was generated by operating activities and the sale of our 29.8% shareholding in Aer 
Lingus generated EUR398.1M. This funded net capital expenditure of EUR482.2M, share buybacks of EUR288.8M 
and debt repayments of EUR194.3M.
 Net cash rose by EUR611.7M to EUR976.0M (Mar 31, 2015: EUR364.3M).
 Shareholders' equity
 Shareholders' equity increased by EUR494.7M to EUR4,529.8M in the period due to net profit after tax of 
EUR1,405.7M offset by a reclassification of EUR291.4M on disposal of the available for sale financial 
asset, EUR288.8M in share buy backs and IFRS accounting treatment for derivatives of EUR336.3M.

 RYANAIR CALLS ON EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO REDUCE REGULATORY BURDEN AND COSTS ON
 AIRLINES TO STIMULATE LOWER FARES FOR CONSUMERS DURING THIS RECESSION
 RYANAIR RELEASES OVER 1 MILLION EUR10 SEATS FOR MID-WEEK TRAVEL IN NOVEMBER AND
 DECEMBER TO KEEP EUROPE FLYING
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (14th October) called on the
 European Commission to reduce the regulatory burden and costs on airlines and
 tackle anti-consumer scams such as fuel surcharges and screenscraper mis-selling
 in order to keep Europe's air fares low during this recession, as consumer
 confidence plummets.
Ryanair remains the only European airline to guarantee the lowest fares on every
 route it operates (as well as guaranteeing no fuel surcharges). Ryanair has
 written to the European Commission drawing its attention to the fact that oil
 prices have fallen by over 50% in recent months, yet many high fares airlines
 including British Airways, Lufthansa and Aer Lingus have failed to reduce their
 unjustified fuel surcharges at all. There is no doubt that these airlines are
 using non discretionary and unavoidable fuel surcharges to scam money unfairly
 from consumers, despite the fact that they are now enjoying much lower oil
Ryanair Holdings PLC Call For EU Commission To Reduce Regulatory Burden
 prices.
Ryanair also called on the EU Commission to take action to protect Europe's
 consumers from screenscrapers, many of whom are engaged in unauthorised breaches
 of copyright and unlawfully accessing websites such as Ryanair.com, and in the
 case of Rumbo.com in Spain (for example) are over charging consumers by up to 50
 times the underlying Ryanair fares, as well as adding large hidden mark-ups
 (unknown to consumers) to some of Ryanair's discretionary service fees.
Ryanair also called on the EU Commission to urgently address and reverse many of
 the expensive, anti-consumer regulations introduced in recent years which have
 added significantly to the cost of all air travel within Europe, while
 delivering minimal passengers benefits. Such measures would include:
· Promoting a single EU air traffic management system which would reduce the
 current EUR7bn annual
 cost  by as much as EUR5bn p.a., as well as reducing
 passenger delays, fuel consumption and emissions.
 ·Scraping the EU261 passenger compensation legislation which is discriminatory
 in that they
 only apply to airlines, but not to competing ferries, trains
 or buses. This legislation should be replaced
 with legislation to  outlaw
 over-booking of flights, which would be a cheap and effective way of
ensuring that no passenger is denied access to a flight once booked.
 ·Scrap the PRM regulation which was introduced last year and have allowed many
 monopoly airports to
 increase the handling costs of disabled passengers by
 up to 400%. At Dublin Airport for example
 Ryanair's PRM costs which were
 less than 10c a passenger when the service was being provided by
 Ryanair,
 has now exploded to over 45c per passenger, because it is provided by an
 inefficient, over-
 charging profiteering airport monopoly.
 ·Scrap the proposed airport charging directive which was formulated by the
 European Commission
 following its flawed decision in the Charleroi case.
 As the current sale discussions
 for Charleroi Airport indicate, not alone
 was the EU Commission's analysis fundamentally wrong,
 but Charleroi
 Airport has been consistently profitable and is now the subject of a number of
 private
Ryanair Holdings PLC Call For EU Commission To Reduce Regulatory Burden
 sector offers for the airport due entirely to the success of
 Ryanair's low cost base and rapid traffic
 growth at Charleroi.
 ·Scrap the 7 State Aid investigations against Ryanair's contracts at small
 regional airports
 including: Alghero, Pau, Frankfurt Hahn, among others,
 given that the current profitability and sale
 of Charleroi proves that
 there was no basis for the EU Commission's erroneous finding of State Aid in
the Charleroi case.
Speaking today in Brussels, Ryanair Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
"The European Airline Industry is now facing a greater challenge and a more
 difficult trading environment than any time over the past 50 years. The European
 economy is in recession, consumer confidence and spending has collapsed and we
 need real leadership from the EU Commission if we are to keep Europe flying and
 keep delivering lower fares with no fuel surcharges for Europe's consumers.
"At a time when many of Europe's airlines have collapsed or are merging to form
 stronger airline groups, perhaps it's time for the European Commission to
 reconsider its prohibition of Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus in 2006.  Europe is
 moving towards a small number of big strong airline groups which is the only way
 these airlines can survive the current financial turmoil and to provide
 passengers with real choice of air services into the future. Surely if Alitalia
 and AirOne can be combined to form a strong airline group in Italy, then it's
 time to allow Ryanair and Aer Lingus to combine to form one equally strong Irish
 airline group.
"The EU Commission can do much to lead the airline industry over the coming
 months and years. Costs can be significantly reduced if unnecessary and
 expensive regulations are done away with, particularly the complicated and
 inefficient air traffic management systems of Europe. Similarly the passenger
 compensation provisions should be replaced with a simple ban on airline
 overbookings, the PRM regulation should allow airlines to provide their own PRM
 services, which we can do at a fraction of the costs that are now being imposed
 on airlines and passengers by inefficient, profiteering airports such as Dublin
 and clearly the whole area of environmental taxes should now be reversed, given
 that both economic activity and oil consumption is in significant decline.
 Airline capacity is being reduced and Europe's consumers simply cannot afford to
 pay these unjustified and inequitable taxes on air tickets at a time when
 Europe's economy and our tourism industry are in recession.
Ryanair has shown the way forward in these difficult times by continuing to
 guarantee the lowest fares and no fuel surcharges. We have seen our profits
Ryanair Holdings PLC Call For EU Commission To Reduce Regulatory Burden
 collapse from EUR480m last year to perhaps break even this year as we absorbed
 these higher oil prices and regulatory costs. We would now like to work with the
 EU Commission and the rest of the industry to examine ways in which these simple
 measures could increase efficiency and lower costs for Europe's hard pressed
 consumers during the current recession. Ryanair has been one of the great
 success stories of European integration. Our lowest fares have allowed almost 60
 million passengers to save over EUR6bn annually by flying Ryanair's low cost,
 on-time flights as compared to the high fare, fuel surcharging delayed flights
 provided by our flag carrier competitors."

 Rule 8 - Dealing Disclosure Requirements
 Under the provisions of Rule 8.3 of the Irish Takeover Panel Act, 1997, Takeover Rules 2007, as amended (the 
"Irish Takeover Rules"), if any person is, or becomes, 'interested' (directly or indirectly) in, 1 percent, or more of any 
class of 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus or Ryanair, all 'dealings' in any 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus or 
Ryanair (including by means of an option in respect of, or a derivative referenced to, any such 'relevant securities') 
must be publicly disclosed by not later than 3:30 p.m. (Dublin time) on the business day following the date of the 
relevant transaction. This requirement will continue until the date on which the Offer becomes effective or on which 
the 'Offer period' otherwise ends. If two or more persons co-operate on the basis of any agreement, either express 
or tacit, either oral or written, to acquire an 'interest' in 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus or Ryanair, they will be 
deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3 of the Irish Takeover Rules.
 Under the provisions of Rule 8.1 of the Irish Takeover Rules, all 'dealings' in 'relevant securities' of Aer Lingus by 
Ryanair or 'relevant securities' of Ryanair by Aer Lingus, or by any of their respective 'associates' must also be 
disclosed by no later than 12 noon (Dublin time) on the business day following the date of the relevant transaction.
 A disclosure table, giving details of the companies in whose 'relevant securities' 'dealings' should be disclosed can 
be found on the Panel's website at www.irishtakeoverpanel.ie.
 'Interests in securities' arise, in summary, when a person has long economic exposure, whether conditional or 
absolute, to changes in the price of securities. In particular, a person will be treated as having an 'interest' by virtue 
of the ownership or control of securities, or by virtue of any option in respect of, or derivative referenced to, 
securities.
 Terms in quotation marks are defined in the Irish Takeover Rules, which can also be found on the Irish Takeover 
Panel's website. If you are in any doubt as to whether or not you are required to disclose a dealing under Rule 8, 
please consult the Panel's website at            www.irishtakeoverpanel.ie or contact the Panel on telephone number 
+353 1 678 9020; fax number +353 1 678 9289.

 In the nine months ended December 31, 2013 the Company bought back 59.6m ordinary shares at a total cost 
of EUR413.9m.  This is equivalent to approximately 4.2% of the Company's issued share capital at March 31, 
2013. All ordinary shares repurchased were cancelled. Accordingly, share capital decreased by 59.6m 
ordinary shares with a nominal value of EUR0.4m and the capital redemption reserve increased by a 
corresponding EUR0.4m.  The capital redemption reserve is required to be created under Irish law to 
preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
 In December 2013, the Company announced that it had entered into an irrevocable arrangement with its 
broker, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, to commence a share buyback programme to repurchase ordinary 
shares to a maximum value of EUR70.1m during the period December 20, 2013 to March 31, 2014.
 On June 20, 2013 the Company detailed plans to return up to EUR1.0 billion to shareholders over the next 
two years (subject to shareholder approval). At December 31, 2013 EUR413.9m has been completed and a 
further EUR66.8m will be completed prior to March 31, 2014, and up to a further EUR519.3m in either 
special dividends or share buybacks in the fiscal year to March 31, 2015.
 14.     Related party transactions
 We have related party relationships with our subsidiaries, directors and senior key management personnel. 
All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
 There were no related party transactions in the nine months ended December 31, 2013 that materially 
affected the financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no 
changes in the related party transactions described in the 2013 Annual Report that could have a material 
effect on the financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.
 15.     Post balance sheet events
 During January 2014, the Company repurchased 4.5m ordinary shares at a total cost of EUR29.6m. All 
ordinary shares repurchased are cancelled.

RYANAIR CRITICISES AER LINGUS RESULTS AND CALLS AGAIN FOR REMOVAL OF UNJUSTIFIED
FUEL SURCHARGES
Ryanair, Aer Lingus's largest shareholder today (Friday, 29th August 2008)
expressed its concern at the half year results reported by Aer Lingus yesterday.
Ryanair is deeply concerned that Aer Lingus (despite a reasonably good fuel
hedging position in 2008) appears to be forecasting a loss of some EUR70m in the
current year and that these losses may increase to over EUR100m in 2009.
Whilst Aer Lingus will doubtless continue to ignore the views of its largest
shareholder, Ryanair calls upon the Board and Management of Aer Lingus to review
its current strategy as follows:
1. Ryanair believes that Aer Lingus should scrap its unjustified fuel surcharges.
It makes no sense for Aer Lingus to lose long-haul traffic to competitor
airlines because of its unjustified fuel surcharges, which have increased six
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR CRITICISES AER LINGUS RESULTS
times since October 2006 (when Ryanair committed to scrapping these unnecessary
fuel surcharges). The fact that Aer Lingus's long-haul load factor has collapsed
from 77% to 67% in the half year demonstrates that this fuel surcharging policy
has failed and should be reversed.
2. Ryanair believes that Aer Lingus's Belfast base has been a financial failure. As
the attached CAA traffic statistics (Jan-June 2008) confirm, Aer Lingus's load
factor at its Belfast base is an uneconomic 50%. Some of Aer Lingus's Belfast
load factors are truly awful, with Paris at 31%, Amsterdam at 36% and Nice a
very poor 38%. In all cases it would appear that Aer Lingus's load factor is
considerably lower than that of Easyjet or Jet2, its competitors at
Belfast International Airport.
3. Ryanair believes that Aer Lingus's cost reduction strategy (PCIO7) has been an
abject failure. Aer Lingus's interim results confirm that its employees have
received EUR17.6m in "compensation" for claimed productivity improvements, yet
staff costs on a per passenger basis have increased during the last half year.
It's hard to believe that paying out EUR17.6m in "compensation" for unverified
productivity improvements is a sensible use of management time or shareholders
money.
4. Ryanair believes that the current Board or Management of Aer Lingus cannot
deliver "fundamental changes in the operating cost base" when over the past 12
months this Board and Management have almost trebled its Directors fees from
EUR17,500 p.a. to EUR45,000 p.a. for each director (incl. many political appointees
and senior trade unionists). Worse still the Non Executive Chairman's fees have
mushroomed fivefold from EUR35,000 in 2006 to EUR175,000 in 2007. Can any Board
whose total cost has almost doubled in the last year from EUR1.4m in 2006 to EUR2.2m
in 2007 really be capable of delivering a "fundamental change in our operating
cost base".
Commenting today, Ryanair's Spokesman, Stephen McNamara said:
"These half year results from Aer Lingus conclusively supports Ryanair's belief
that its 2006 takeover strategy for Aer Lingus was the right one. Ryanair
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR CRITICISES AER LINGUS RESULTS
promised to reduce Aer Lingus's fares, scrap Aer Lingus's fuel surcharges and
reduce Aer Lingus's costs in order to secure the future of Aer Lingus within one
strong Irish airline group.
"As the current wave of European airline mergers and takeovers gathers pace, it
is clear that Aer Lingus is being marginalised on the sidelines of European
aviation, losing money, with no apparent strategy to return to profitability.
Its independence strategy, which over the past year has delivered higher fares,
a sixfold increase in its fuel surcharges, route closures in Ireland, and a
lurch to substantial losses has failed its customers, its staff and has we
believe failed to secure Aer Lingus's long-term viability".

                       RYANAIR DUBLIN PILOTS EACH RECEIVE
                          EUR50,000 SHARE OPTION WINDFALL
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Friday, 4th November 2005)
confirmed that many of its Dublin pilots will, next month (1 Dec), exercise
share options which at the current share price (over EUR7) have a profit of
approx. EUR50,000 each. These share options (which formed part of the 5 year pay,
benefit and share option scheme collectively negotiated directly between the
Dublin pilots and the airline in November 2000) fall due to be exercised at the
end of November. The total value of the shares held by each qualifying pilot
under the scheme are presently valued at over EUR175,000. If any pilot were to
exercise and dispose of their options at this week's price of EUR7 he/she would
make a profit of just over EUR50,000 on these options.
These latest share options are the ninth tranche of options which Ryanair's
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Pilot Share Options
Dublin pilots have enjoyed over each of the past nine years. The total value of
these options to each qualifying Dublin pilot since Ryanair floated in 1997 is
almost EUR500,000 and if disposed of at the exercise date, they have generated a
total profit of almost EUR300,000 for each qualifying Dublin pilot.
Welcoming this latest tranche of profitable share options for Ryanair's pilots,
Ryanair's Director of Personnel, Eddie Wilson said:
    "This ninth round of share options is the latest in a long line of share
     options and other benefits which Ryanair's pilots have successfully
     negotiated directly with the airline in recent years. Since Ryanair floated
     in 1997, a Ryanair Captain in Dublin has seen
   his/her annual earnings rise to over EUR120,000 per annum,
    his/her transfer to flying brand new Boeing 737-800 series aircraft,
    he/she enjoys a fixed roster which guarantees 5 days off in every 15
     days,
    he/she enjoys a legal limit of 900 flying hours per annum, which equates
     to 18 flight hours per week,
    share options, which thus far have yielded profits of almost EUR300,000 per
     qualifying pilot.
    "This EUR50,000 share option profit is just the latest benefit which Ryanair's
     Dublin pilots have negotiated directly (through collective bargaining) with
     the airline. Ryanair's pay, promotion, job security and share options are
     better than any other similar 737 pilot package in Europe. This is why
     Ryanair has over the past 12 months recruited more than 150 pilots from
     other airlines including Easyjet, Lufthansa, SAS, Alitalia, Aer Lingus and
     British Midlands. Ryanair will continue to negotiate directly with all our
     pilots, and we hope that as a result of this internal collective bargaining
     process they will continue to share in Ryanair's success as we continue to
     grow to become Europe's largest and most valuable airline".

 We welcome the UK Competition Commission's recent affirmation of its 2008 decision to break up the high cost 
BAA monopoly. We believe that this will deliver more efficient facilities, lower costs and a better service to airlines 
and passengers, where in recent years the BAA monopoly under its inadequate regulator, the CAA, has repeatedly 
failed airline and passenger users. We continue to campaign for a similar break-up of the failed DAA airport 
monopoly in Ireland, where grandiose, unnecessary and profligate building projects including the new terminal in 
Cork (cost EUR200m), and T2 in Dublin (EUR1.2bn) have delivered excess terminal capacity at a cost more than 
six times higher than the DAA's original forecast (of between EUR170m to EUR200m for T2). This wasteful and 
unnecessary capex has now been used to justify a 40% increase in Dublin's passenger charges, making Dublin and 
Stansted the two most expensive airports in Ryanair's 150 plus airports.
 2011 will be the fourth consecutive year of traffic declines at Dublin Airport, where traffic has fallen by 30% from a 
peak of 24.5m in 2007 to just over 18m in 2010. Dublin now operates two terminals, both of them half empty, yet 
the two main airlines (Ryanair and Aer Lingus) are expected to pay for these expensive and profligate facilities 
which we neither wanted nor supported. It is impossible not to agree with Aer Lingus' recent description of the 
Dublin Airport charges as "insane". Similarly at Stansted, traffic declined in 2010 for the fourth year in a row. BAA 
Stansted's financial statements now clearly demonstrate that the BAA is using the regulatory system to overcharge 
Stansted airlines to cross subsidise Heathrow and the BAA, even as the number of routes and traffic continues to 
decline. In recent months airlines including easyJet, Air Berlin, Turkish, Thomson, Cyprus Airlines, Star1, and Air 
AsiaX have announced plans to reduce capacity further at Stansted, as the BAA gouges its airline customers. The 
fact that BAA Stansted has wasted more than GBP200m on a cancelled second runway project over the past 8 
years is another stunning indictment of the regulatory failure of the CAA, and the waste and profligacy of the BAA 
airport monopoly.
 Our Passengers
 Despite these regulatory failures, Ryanair continues to grow its business, while delivering lower fares, better 
punctuality, fewer lost bags and fewer passenger complaints than any other airline in Europe. We deliver Europe's 
No.1 passenger service for the benefit of our passengers, our people and our shareholders.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -2-
 When it comes to passenger service, no one beats Ryanair. During the current recession, price continues to be the 
key factor in most passengers' travel decision, and because Ryanair beats every other airline on price, we have 
grown to become the world's favourite airline, with 72.1m passengers carried in the fiscal year. IATA's recent 2010 
traffic statistics confirm that Ryanair carries substantially more international passengers than any other scheduled 
airline in calendar 2010.

However Ryanair's growth and success is not based solely on price. In addition to the lowest fares in every market, 
we also offer:
 1. The best punctuality. Last year 85% of all flights arrived on-time.
 2. The fewest lost bags - last year we lost less than one bag for every 2,000 passengers carried.
 3. The fewest complaints - last year we received less than one complaint per 1,000 passengers.
 4. The youngest fleet - the average age of Ryanair's 272 aircraft is now just 3 years old.
 5. Prompt response to passenger complaints - last year Ryanair replied to more than 99% of passenger complaints 
within our 7 working day commitment.
 6. The world's greenest, cleanest airline - the most recent Brighter Planet research confirms that Ryanair is the 
world's greenest/cleanest airline.
 Details of this Brighter Planet report are available to read on the www.ryanair.com website.
 Over the past year Ryanair accommodated 72.1m passenger bookings, at an average fare of EUR39. These 
passengers have saved an average of EUR7bn over the high fares being charged by our higher fare competitors 
incl. easyJet, Aer Lingus, Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa.
 Our people
 Over the past year, average employment numbers in Ryanair rose by 15% from 7,032 to 8,063. Within this 
number, more than 350 people were promoted as Ryanair's growth created new opportunities for career 
development and progression. Ryanair's people know that they can advance their careers by taking advantage of 
our commitment to promote from within wherever possible. I am pleased that after two years of pay freezes, we 
were able to grant our people a small pay increase in April with an average 2% rise in basic pay, subject to 
performance, across most grades. In addition, Ryanair continues to improve our rosters in order to maximise our 
people's productivity while they are at work, while also maximising their time off.
 Our shareholders
 Unlike other airlines, Ryanair continues to put our shareholders and their interests at the front and centre of our 
activity. Unlike other airlines, the Board and Management team in Ryanair have a significant stake in the company. 
We think and act over the short and medium and long term, like shareholders, because we are substantial 
shareholders.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -2-
 Our 2011 net profit after tax of EUR401m ($565m) makes Ryanair the world's most profitable low fares airline as 
highlighted by Air Transport World in July 2011.

Over the past year, Ryanair paid a dividend of over EUR500m to shareholders. This brings total funds returned to 
shareholders (through share buybacks and dividends) to almost EUR850m over the past three years. We are 
extremely proud that we have returned more funds to shareholders, than the total net equity funds raised from them 
since we floated in 1997.
 As a capital intensive company, in a very cyclical industry, it would be wrong for shareholders to expect a 
continuous dividend stream. We intend to continue to build up cash, so that we can avail of opportunities including 
aircraft purchases, or acquisitions that will enhance Ryanair's profitability and our returns to shareholders. 
Shareholders may rest assured that since the Board and Management of Ryanair continue to be significant 
shareholders in the company, our interests and theirs remain at one.
 Finally, I would like to personally thank the Chairman, the Board, the Senior Management and all of the team in 
Ryanair for their hard work and commitment which has helped Ryanair to deliver another year of growth in fleet, 
traffic and profits for the benefit of the passengers, our people and our shareholders. Rest assured that we will 
continue to work hard to make Ryanair, not just the world's favourite airline, but also the world's most profitable 
airline, capable of generating significant returns for our passengers, our people and our shareholders.

Cash Offer by
 Coinside Limited
 a wholly owned subsidiary of
Ryanair Holdings plc
 for
 Aer Lingus Group plc
RYANAIR ANNOUNCES MERGER PROPOSAL WITH AER LINGUS, BY OFFERING EUR1.40 PER AER
 LINGUS SHARE WHICH WILL LEAD TO ONE STRONG IRISH AIRLINE GROUP, LOWER FARES FOR
 CONSUMERS, RAPID FLEET GROWTH AND 1,000 NEW JOBS IN AER LINGUS. OFFER WORTH OVER
 EUR325M IN CASH TO IRISH GOVERNMENT AND ESOT/ AER LINGUS EMPLOYEES.
Summary
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer for Aer Lingus Group
The Board of Ryanair today announces its intention to make a Cash Offer of EUR1.40
 per Aer Lingus Share for 100 per cent. of the issued and to be issued share
 capital of Aer Lingus. Ryanair intends to make this offer through its
 wholly-owned subsidiary, Coinside.  Ryanair already owns approximately 29.82 per
 cent. of the current issued share capital of Aer Lingus and expects to accept
 the Cash Offer in respect of these shares.
The Board of Ryanair proposes to merge the two airlines into one strong Irish
 airline group under common ownership. Similar to previous European airline
 mergers such as Air France/KLM and Lufthansa/Swiss, both airlines will operate
 as separate companies, with distinctive brands, thereby preserving the best
 features of both, including Ryanair's low fare, high punctuality operations, and
 Aer Lingus' special brand, service culture as well as its long haul operations.
Benefits for Aer Lingus Shareholders
The Offer values the entire issued ordinary share capital of Aer Lingus at
 approximately EUR748 million. Key features of the Offer are:
*  This is an all cash offer
*  It represents a premium of approximately 28 per cent. over the average Closing
 Price (EUR1.09) of an Aer Lingus share for the 30 days to 28 November 2008 (being
 the last Business Day prior to the date of this announcement)
*  It represents a premium of approximately 25 per cent. over the Closing Price
 (EUR1.12) of an Aer Lingus Share on 28 November 2008
Benefits for Aer Lingus and its Employees
Ryanair has requested an early meeting with the Chairman and Board
 representatives of Aer Lingus, as well as the ESOT trustees, to explain the
 benefits Ryanair believes will flow to the Aer Lingus business and its employees
 from this proposed merger, including:
*  The Aer Lingus ESOT and employee shareholders will receive over EUR137 million in
 cash if the Offer is successful
 *  A commitment to double the size of the Aer Lingus short haul fleet, from 33 to
 66 aircraft over the next 5 years, thereby creating 1,000 new jobs in Aer Lingus
 during that period
 *  Better promotion prospects for Aer Lingus employees through this rapid growth
 *  Improved job security as part of one strong Irish airline group
 *  Aer Lingus employees will join one of Europe's Big Four airline groups (Air
 France/KLM, Lufthansa/Swiss, British Airways Group and Aer Lingus/Ryanair)
 *  Aer Lingus employees join an Irish national champion with pan-European network
 *  Aer Lingus to remain a separate company and retain its special brand like KLM
 and Swiss precedents
 *  The Aer Lingus Chairman will be invited to join the Board of Ryanair
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer for Aer Lingus Group
Benefits for Irish Government and Consumers
Ryanair has requested early meetings with the Minister for Finance and the
 Minister for Transport to highlight the benefits Ryanair believes will flow from
 this merger for the Irish Government and consumers including:
*  Ireland will establish one of Europe's "Big Four" airlines which will be
 financially strong, as well as managed and headquartered in Dublin
 *  Securing Aer Lingus' special brand, Heathrow slots and connectivity for Ireland
 *  Doubling Aer Lingus' short haul fleet to 66 aircraft and creating 1,000
 associated new jobs in Aer Lingus over a 5 year period
 *  Irish Government will receive over EUR188 million in cash if the Offer is
 successful, which will make a valuable contribution towards current budget
 spending in areas such as health and education
 *  Ryanair's commitment to growth and lower fares will help the government combat
 recent declines in Irish traffic and tourism
 *  Merged Irish group will have the cleanest, most fuel efficient fleet of Europe's
 Big Four airline groups
 *  Ryanair's commitment to cut Aer Lingus' average short haul fares (EUR94 in 2007)
 by 5% for 3 years, generating an approx EUR40 million p.a. saving for consumers
 *  Ryanair's commitment to eliminate Aer Lingus' long haul fuel surcharges on
 completion, generating an approx EUR100 million p.a. saving for consumers
 *  Improve Aer Lingus' on-time performance to Ryanair's levels
 *  Ryanair secures the Cork and Dublin slots at Heathrow, as well as Heathrow
 connectivity at lower fares for Ireland
 *  Ryanair will upgrade and develop Aer Lingus' long haul product and service
Ryanair believes this Cash Offer provides attractive and certain value for Aer
 Lingus shareholders. Ryanair believes the Cash Offer is generous in the context
 of:
*  The collapse in Aer Lingus' share price from a high of over EUR3.00 in December
 2006 to less than EUR1.00 in November 2008
 *  Aer Lingus' load factors which have declined by over 7% (long haul) and almost
 2% (short haul) in 2008
 *  Aer Lingus' forecast operating losses for 2008 and again in 2009
 *  The current airline industry crisis amid the deepening economic recession
 *  Declining equity prices
In the opinion of the Board of Ryanair, Aer Lingus' management have failed to
 deliver on the reasons they articulated in their 2006 defence documents for
 remaining an independent airline. Since 2006, when Aer Lingus rejected Ryanair's
 EUR2.80 offer, they have:
*  Spent over EUR24 million on its defence of Ryanair's 2006 EUR2.80 offer
 *  Allowed its director's basic annual fee to almost treble from EUR17,500 to EUR45,000
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer for Aer Lingus Group
 *  Allowed its non-executive Chairman's basic annual fee to increase fivefold from
 EUR35,000 to EUR175,000
 *  Increased short haul fares by 7% to EUR94
 *  Increased fuel surcharges 5 times to a current average of EUR75 per sector
 *  Suffered repeated strike threats in April 2006, February, August and November
 2007, February and November 2008
 *  Closed its Shannon base in December 2007
 *  Opened a Belfast base in December 2007 which is performing poorly
 *  Ordered new A330 aircraft in 2007 (at the top of the cycle), but then deferred
 an A330 delivery in November 2008
 *  Suffered short haul and long haul load factor declines in 2008
 *  Forecast operating losses of EUR20 million in 2008 and another operating loss for
 2009
Ryanair believes that Aer Lingus is an isolated, uncompetitive, loss making EU
 flag carrier which has been bypassed by accelerating EU wide airline
 consolidation. Ryanair believes that Aer Lingus needs to find a strong airline
 partner to secure its future. Over the past two years, the trading environment
 for all European airlines has deteriorated dramatically as a result of high oil
 prices and the global recession. This has triggered a wave of EU airline
 closures and failures (in all, over 30 airlines have failed this year). In
 response, pan-European airline consolidation has accelerated as Europe sees the
 emergence of three large mega-carriers, Air France, British Airways and
 Lufthansa, and the rapid growth of Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline.
 So far this year, the following consolidations have been either announced,
 proposed or are being considered:
*  Easyjet - GB Airways
 *  ClickAir - Vueling - Iberia
 *  Alitalia - Air One
 *  Lufthansa - SN Brussels
 *  Air France/KLM - VLM
 *  Air France/KLM - Martinair (proposed)
 *  Lufthansa - BMI (proposed)
 *  Lufthansa - Austrian (proposed)
 *  British Airways - Iberia (being considered)
 *  Air France/KLM or Lufthansa - Alitalia/AirOne (being considered)
Ryanair believes that today's Offer provides a financially robust partner, in
 one strong Irish airline group, within which Aer Lingus will retain its separate
 brand as well as secure the Heathrow slots and connectivity for Ireland at lower
 fares.
The Cash Offer, which will be made by Coinside, a wholly owned subsidiary of
 Ryanair, will be subject to certain conditions set out in Appendix I, including,
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer for Aer Lingus Group
 amongst other conditions, the acceptance by Aer Lingus Shareholders holding not
 less than 90 per cent. of the issued and to be issued share capital of Aer
 Lingus (or such lower percentage as Ryanair may determine, subject always to the
 Takeover Rules), the passing of the Ryanair Shareholder Resolutions at an EGM to
 be held as soon as reasonably practicable to approve the Cash Offer, and Ryanair
 obtaining EU Commission clearance or (as the case may be) Irish and other
 applicable EU member state competition law clearance for the combination of
 Ryanair and Aer Lingus.
Commenting on the Offer, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"This proposed merger of Ryanair and Aer Lingus will form one Irish airline
 group with the financial strength to compete with Europe's 3 major airline
 groups - Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa.
The world has changed dramatically over the past two years, as high oil prices
 and deep recession have caused a flood of airline bankruptcies, consolidations
 and capacity cutbacks. Aer Lingus, as a small, stand alone, regional airline has
 been marginalised and bypassed as most other EU flag carriers consolidate.
Over the past 2 years, the management of Aer Lingus have failed its
 shareholders, customers and staff. Its shares have fallen from over EUR3, to less
 than EUR1 recently. Fares and fuel surcharge increases have cost consumers over

Not for release, publication or distribution, in whole or in part, in or into or
  from Australia, Canada, Japan, South Africa or the United States or any other
                 jurisdiction where it would be unlawful to do so
                             FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
                        CLARIFICATION OF STATEMENTS MADE
In relation to the offer made by Ryanair on 23 October 2006 for whole of the
issued and to be issued share capital of Aer Lingus Group plc not already owned
by Ryanair (the "Offer"), the Participating Directors wish to clarify that
certain remarks made by Mr. Mannion to the media on 3 November 2006 in relation
to Aer Lingus not approving a Ryanair bid or any other offer for Aer Lingus were
made only in respect of the Offer. The Participating Directors are only able to
consider formal proposals when made and at that time will take such action as is
in the best interests of the Company.
This clarification is being made at the request of the Irish Takeover Panel
Aer Lingus Group PLC Clarification re: statements
following a determination by it that certain comments made by Mr. Mannion
breached Rule 19.6(b) of the Irish Takeover Rules, which states that neither an
offeror nor the offeree nor any representative of either of them shall during
the course of an offer release any new information bearing on the offer or
contemplated offer in any interview or discussion with the media.
Date: 16 November 2006
The Participating Directors of Aer Lingus accept responsibility for the
information contained in this announcement. To the best of the knowledge and
belief of the Participating Directors (having taken all reasonable care to
ensure that such is the case), the information contained in this announcement is
in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect its
import. The "Participating Directors" means all of the directors of Aer Lingus
other than Mr Francis Hackett and Mr Michael Johns.
Mr Hackett and Mr Johns are not, for the time being, participating in the
Board's consideration of the Offer and related matters because the Participating
Directors have concluded that it would be in the best interests of the Company
and its shareholders as a whole if, for the time being, the Directors appointed
by the Minister for Transport and the Aer Lingus Employee Share Ownership Trust
respectively, did not so participate.
Aer Lingus is being advised by Goldman Sachs International, Merrion Stockbrokers
Limited and Goodbody Stockbrokers in relation to the Offer.
Goldman Sachs International, which is authorised and regulated in the United
Kingdom by the Financial Services Authority, is acting exclusively for Aer
Lingus Group plc and no one else in connection with the Offer by Ryanair

 -- The Company is exempt from NASDAQ's requirement with respect to audit committee approval of related-party 
transactions, as well as its requirement that shareholders approve certain stock or asset purchases when a director, 
officer or substantial shareholder has an interest. The Company is subject to extensive provisions under the Listing 
Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange (the "Irish Listing Rules") governing transactions with related parties, as defined 
therein, and the Irish Companies Act also restricts the extent to which Irish companies may enter into related-party 
transactions. In addition, the Articles contain provisions regarding disclosure of interests by the directors and 
restrictions on their votes in circumstances involving conflicts of interest. The concept of a related party for 
purposes of NASDAQ's audit committee and shareholder approval rules differs in certain respects from the 
definition of a transaction with a related party under the Irish Listing Rules.
 -- NASDAQ requires shareholder approval for certain transactions involving the sale or issuance by a listed 
company of common stock other than in a public offering. Under the NASDAQ rules, whether shareholder approval 
is required for such transactions depends, among other things, on the number of shares to be issued or sold in 
connection with a transaction, while the Irish Listing Rules require shareholder approval when the size of a 
transaction exceeds a certain percentage of the size of the listed company undertaking the transaction.
 -- NASDAQ requires that each issuer solicit proxies and provide proxy statements for all meetings of shareholders 
and provide copies of such proxy solicitation to NASDAQ. The Company is exempt from this requirement as the 
solicitation of holders of ADSs is not required under the Irish Listing Rules or the Irish Companies Acts. Details of 
our annual general meetings and other shareholder meetings, together with the requirements for admission, voting 
or the appointment of a proxy are available on the website of the Company in accordance with the Irish Companies 
Acts and the Company's Articles of Association. ADS holders may provide instructions to The Bank of New York, as 
depositary, as to the voting of the underlying Ordinary Shares represented by such ADSs. Alternatively, ADS 
holders may convert their holding to Ordinary Shares, subject to compliance with the nationality ownership rules, in 
order to be eligible to attend our annual general meetings or other shareholder meetings.
 The Company also follows certain other practices under the Combined Code in lieu of those set forth in the 
NASDAQ corporate governance rules, as expressly permitted thereby. Most significantly:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -43-
 -- Independence. NASDAQ requires that a majority of an issuer's Board of Directors be "independent" under the 
standards set forth in the NASDAQ rules and that directors deemed independent be identified in the Company's 
annual report. The Board of Directors has determined that each of the Company's eight non-executive directors is 
"independent" under the standards set forth in the Combined Code. Under the Combined Code, there is no bright-
line test establishing set criteria for independence, as there is under NASDAQ Rule 4200(a)(15). Instead, the Board 
of Directors determines whether the director is "independent in character and judgment," and whether there are 
relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the director's judgment. Under 
the Combined Code, the Board of Directors may determine that a director is independent notwithstanding the 
existence of relationships or circumstances which may appear relevant to its determination, but it should state its 
reasons if it makes such a determination. The Combined Code specifies that relationships or circumstances that 
may be relevant include whether the director: (i) has been an employee of the relevant company or group within the 
last five years; (ii) has had within the last three years a direct or indirect material business relationship with such 
company; (iii) has received payments from such company, subject to certain exceptions; (iv) has close family ties 
with any of the company's advisers, directors or senior employees; (v) holds cross-directorships or other significant 
links with other directors; (vi) represents a significant shareholder; or (vii) has served on the Board of Directors for 
more than nine years. In determining that each of the eight non-executive directors is independent under the 
Combined Code standard, the Ryanair Holdings Board of Directors identified such relevant factors with respect to 
non-executive directors Messrs. Bonderman, McLaughlin, Osborne, Horgan and Pietrogrande. When arriving at the 
decision that these directors are nonetheless independent, the Board of Directors has taken into account the 
comments made by the Financial Reporting Council in its report dated December 2009 on its review of the impact 
and effectiveness of the Combined Code. The NASDAQ independence criteria specifically state that an individual 
may not be considered independent if, within the last three years, such individual or a member of his or her 
immediate family has had certain specified relationships with the company, its parent, any consolidated subsidiary, 
its internal or external auditors, or any company that has significant business relationships with the company, its 
parent or any consolidated subsidiary. Neither ownership of a significant amount of stock nor length of service on 
the board is a per se bar to independence under the NASDAQ rules.
 -- CEO compensation. The NASDAQ rules require that an issuer's chief executive officer not be present during 
voting or deliberations by the Board of Directors on his or her compensation. There is no such requirement under 
the Combined Code.

 There were no exceptional items in the period ended June 30, 2011. Exceptional items in the period ended June 
30, 2010 amounted to a net of tax charge of EUR44.8m reflecting the estimated costs relating to the closure of 
airspace in April and May 2010 due to the Icelandic volcanic ash disruptions. This estimate was subsequently 
reduced to a net of tax amount of EUR26.1m at year ended March 31, 2011.
 Adjusted profit after tax excluding exceptional items in the period ended June 30, 2011 increased by 1% to 
EUR139.3m. Including exceptional items the profit after tax for the period increased by 49% from EUR93.7 to 
EUR139.3m.
 Summary period ended June 30, 2011
 Adjusted profit after tax increased by 1% to EUR139.3m compared to EUR138.5m in the period ended June 30, 
2011 primarily due to an 11% increase in average fares and strong ancillary revenues, offset by a 49% increase in 
fuel costs. Total operating revenues increased by 29% to EUR1,155.4m as average fares rose by 11%. Ancillary 
revenues grew by 21%, faster than the 18% increase in passenger numbers, to EUR247.7m due to an improved 
product mix and higher internet related revenues. Total revenue per passenger, as a result, increased by 9% whilst 
Load Factor remained flat at 83% during the period.
 Total operating expenses increased by 35% to EUR985.5m, primarily due to an increase in fuel prices and the 
higher level of activity and operating costs associated with the growth of the airline. Fuel, which represents 43% of 
total operating costs compared to 39% in the prior period, increased by 49% to EUR426.6m due to the higher price 
per gallon paid and a 29% increase in the number of hours flown. Unit costs excluding fuel increased by 7% and 
sector length adjusted, they fell by 1%. Including fuel unit costs rose by 14%. Operating margin decreased by 4 
points to 15% whilst operating profit was flat at EUR169.9m.
 Adjusted net margin was down 3 points to 12%, compared to June 30, 2010.
 Adjusted earnings per share for the period were 9.35 euro cent compared to 9.36 euro cent at June 30, 2010.
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash increased by EUR273.2m since March 31, 2011 to EUR3,213.8m. The Group generated cash from 
operating activities of EUR348.7m which funded net capital expenditure of EUR3.4m and debt repayments. Gross

debt decreased by EUR78.3m to EUR3,571.1m. Net debt has fallen from EUR708.8m at March 31, 2011 to 
EUR357.3m at the period end.
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis for the Period ended June 30, 2011
 Adjusted profit after tax increased by 1% to EUR139.3m primarily due to an 11% increase in average fares and 
strong ancillary revenues offset by higher fuel costs. Total operating revenues increased by 29% to EUR1,155.4m 
primarily due to an 11% increase in average fares, and an 18% increase in passenger numbers. Fuel, which 
represents 43% of total operating costs compared to 39% in the prior year, increased by 49% to EUR426.6m due to 
a higher price per gallon paid, and a 29% increase in the number of hours flown. Unit costs excluding fuel rose by 
7%, when adjusted for sector length, unit costs fell by 1%. Including fuel unit costs rose by 14%. Operating margin, 
as a result of the above, decreased by 4 points to 15%, whilst operating profit was relatively flat at EUR169.9m.
 Total operating revenues increased by 29% to EUR1,155.4m primarily due to an 11% increase in average fares 
and an 18% increase in passenger numbers to 21.3m.
 Total revenue per passenger increased by 9% primarily due to an 11% increase in average fare per passenger.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 31% to EUR907.7m due to an 18% rise in flown passengers and an 
11% increase in average fares. Load factor remained flat at 83%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 21% to EUR247.7m, faster than the 18% increase in passenger volume, due to an 
improved product mix and higher internet related revenues.
 Total operating expenses increased by 35% to EUR985.5m due to the 49% increase in fuel costs and an 8% 
increase in sector length.
 Staff costs increased by 21% to EUR107.3m due to a 19% increase in sectors flown and a companywide pay 
increase of 2% granted in April 2011.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 26% to EUR77.9m due to the increase in activity and a higher number 
of 'owned' aircraft in the fleet (June 30, 2011: 221) this period compared to the period ended June 30, 2010 (195).
 Fuel & oil costs increased by 49% to EUR426.6m due to higher fuel prices and the increased number of hours 
flown.
 Maintenance costs increased by 8% to EUR23.5m due to an increase in the weighted average number of leased 
aircraft.
 Aircraft rental costs were down 10% at EUR21.7m, due to lower lease costs on newer aircraft.
 Route charges are up 34% to EUR133.0m due to the increased number of sectors flown, the longer sector length 
and higher average rates charged by Eurocontrol.
 Airport & handling charges increased by 31% to EUR152.3m, due to the 18% increase in passenger numbers, 
higher airport charges at Dublin airport, and the mix of new routes and bases launched.
 Marketing, distribution & other increased by 52% to EUR43.2m, reflecting higher marketing spend per passenger 
due to increased activity, higher onboard sales and increased product costs.
 Operating margin decreased by 4 points to 15% due to the reasons outlined above and operating profits have 
remained relatively flat at EUR169.9m.
 Finance income increased by 56% to EUR9.7m primarily due to improved deposit yields on longer dated deposits. 
Finance expense increased by 34% to EUR27.0m due to the higher level of debt in the period compared to the 
period ended June 30, 2010.
 Adjusted net margin was down 3 points to 12%, compared to June 30, 2010.
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash increased by EUR273.2m to EUR3,213.8m and the Group generated cash from operating activities of 
EUR348.7m which funded net capital expenditure of EUR3.4m and debt repayments. Gross debt decreased by 
EUR78.3m to EUR3,571.1m. Net debt has fallen from EUR708.8m at March 31, 2011 to EUR357.3m at the period 
end.
 Shareholders' equity decreased by EUR53.1m in the period to EUR2,900.8m due to the impact of IFRS accounting 
treatment for derivatives, available for sale financial assets and stock option grants, a net profit after tax of 
EUR139.3m in the period and the issue of new shares, associated with the employee share option programme, of 
EUR2.7m.

Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and Transparency Rules of the Republic of Ireland's 
Financial Regulator and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Services 
Authority.
 This interim management report includes the following:
 -- Reconciliation of results for the period under International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") to adjusted 
results for the quarter ended June 30, 2011;
 -- Principal risks and uncertainties relating to the remaining nine months of the year;

important events that occurred during the three months, are set forth above in the Operating and Financial 
Overview.
 Reconciliation of results for the period under IFRS to adjusted results for the quarter ended June 30, 2011
 The unaudited condensed consolidated interim income statement for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, as set forth 
on page 5 of this three month financial report, presents the results for the periods separately between pre-
exceptional and exceptional items. Certain items are presented separately, as exceptional items, which, by virtue of 
their size or incidence, are unusual in the context of the Groups ongoing core operations, as we believe this 
presentation represents the underlying business more accurately and reflects the manner in which investors 
typically analyse the results.

costs associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, UK, European Union ("EU") 
and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and 
interest rates, airport access and charges, labour relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the 
general economic environment in Ireland, the UK, and Continental Europe, the general willingness of passengers to 
travel and other economic, social and political factors and flight interruptions caused by volcanic ash emissions or 
other atmospheric disruptions.

27 June 2007
       RYANAIR TO APPEAL UNLAWFUL EU DECISION TO COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE
              CALLS ON AER LINGUS TO SCRAP UNFAIR FUEL SURCHARGES
               LAUNCHES 2M SEATS FOR EUR10 (incl. taxes & charges)
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Wednesday, 27th June)
confirmed that it would appeal the EU Commission's unlawful decision to prohibit
the merger with Aer Lingus to the European Court of First Instance. Ryanair
expressed confidence that this prohibition will be overturned because;
 a. This is the first time that the Commission has prohibited a merger between
     two companies which combined will have less than 5 % of the EU market.
 b. This is the first time that the Commission has prohibited an airline merger
     and reverses a 20 year policy of encouraging EU airline mergers, having
     previously approved the larger Air France/KLM merger and the Lufthansa/
     Austrian/Swiss mergers.
 c. This is the first time that an EU airline merger offered guaranteed fare
     reductions of over EUR100m p.a. for the benefit of consumers.
 d. This prohibition leaves Aer Lingus exposed as a small, peripheral loss
     making regional airline which cannot compete with Ryanair on price or
     punctuality from Dublin (it has recently pulled off another 5 Ryanair routes
     from Dublin) at a time when the rest of the European industry is
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYR TO APPEAL EU DECISION
     consolidating. Aer Lingus lost EUR70m last year despite an average short haul
     fare of over EUR90 (more than double Ryanair's average fare of EUR41).
Ryanair confirmed that the prohibition would be bad news for Aer Lingus'
passengers who will continue to suffer higher fares, unnecessary fuel
surcharges, poor punctuality and repeated strikes (such as the latest staff walk
out just two weeks ago).
Ryanair also criticised the continuing failure of the Board and Management of
Aer Lingus to deliver value for its customers or shareholders;
1. Aer Lingus fares are rising (in line with its IPO strategy).
 2. Aer Lingus has recently raised its unjustified fuel surcharges for long haul
     passengers.
 3. Aer Lingus has wasted almost EUR20m of shareholders' funds to oppose a bid of
     EUR2.80 per share when its share price is just EUR2.60.
 4. Aer Lingus has ordered new long haul aircraft recently when prices are at an
     all time high.
 5. Aer Lingus has (since Ryanair's offer) pulled services from 5 more Ryanair
     routes because it is unable to match Ryanair's punctuality or prices.
 6. Aer Lingus has supported the DAA's proposed T2 which will double passenger
     charges at Dublin and substantially increase Aer Lingus' costs.
 7. Aer Lingus has presided over a decline in the share price from over EUR3.00 to
     just EUR2.60 yesterday - significantly below Ryanair's offer price.
Aer Lingus' actions in recent weeks has damaged its cost base and destroyed
significant shareholder value. It would appear that the Board of Aer Lingus is
more interested in looking after its own interests and those of the Irish
Government than it is in lowering airfares or increasing its share price. In its
defence documents, Aer Lingus claimed that Ryanair's offer of EUR2.80 per share
"devalued Aer Lingus". How does it now explain or justify a share price as low
as EUR2.60, significantly less than Ryanair's offer?
Speaking today in Dublin Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said;
        "Aer Lingus claimed yesterday that the EU Commission's prohibition is
         'another boost for Aer Lingus and for consumers'. This is nonsense. Aer
         Lingus' share price is now significantly below Ryanair's EUR2.80 offer
         which means that their shareholders are losing out. The fact that
         consumers will be denied the Ryanair guarantee of lower Aer Lingus fares
         and the elimination of fuel surcharges means that they will suffer a
         penalty of over EUR100m p.a.
        "Aer Lingus is continuing to waste shareholders' money by ordering new
         aircraft at the top of the cycle, by supporting expensive T2 facilities
         at Dublin airport which will double their costs and by wasting almost
         EUR20m of shareholders funds to oppose Ryanair's EUR2.80 offer. This waste
         has been reflected in their falling share price.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYR TO APPEAL EU DECISION
        "We call on Aer Lingus to lower their fares and scrap these unfair fuel
         surcharges and at least deliver the same value to consumers that
         Ryanair's offer would. In the mean time Ryanair will continue to grow,
         will continue to offer lower fares and will continue to beat Aer Lingus
         on price and punctuality. We look forward to the European Courts
         overturning this unprecedented and unlawful prohibition".
The directors of Ryanair accept responsibility for the information contained in

RYANAIR'S GUIDANCE LARGELY UNCHANGED AT AGM
5 Million EUR5 Seats on Sale for October/November
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Thursday, 18th September
2008) held its AGM in Dublin to update shareholders on trading, the difficult
economic environment and recent airline industry developments in Europe.
Commenting on its outlook for the current year to 31st March 2009, Ryanair
reiterated that it expected to carry just over 58 million passengers. The
Company did not significantly alter its full year guidance which has improved
from the previous "breakeven to minus EUR60m" to a current "breakeven" based on
Q.4 oil remaining at $100 per barrel (down from $130 p. bl) this Winter. Ryanair
welcomed the recent fall in oil prices. It has hedged most of its Q.3
requirements at $124 per barrel, but remains unhedged for Q.4. Whilst Ryanair
expects to pay less for oil in Q.4, these savings may well be eaten up by lower
Ryanair Holdings PLC AGM Statement
yields this Winter, as the UK, Irish and European economies go into recession
and consumer confidence plummets.
Ryanair will respond to these negative trends by lowering fares this Winter, and
underlined its intent by releasing 5 million seats this morning for travel in
October, and the first two weeks of November for just EUR5 one way (incl. taxes
and charges). Ryanair remains the only European airline to guarantee the lowest
fares on every route and no fuel surcharges as well.
Ryanair expects more airline bankruptcies in the coming weeks following the
recent closures of Zoom, Futura, XL Airways and the bankruptcy of Alitalia.
Ryanair believes that many unviable loss making European airlines will cease
trading this Winter because of unsustainable losses and insufficient cash
reserves. Ryanair recommends that any passengers making bookings this Winter,
should book with Ryanair, which has over EUR2 billion in cash. Ryanair called on
Europe's high fare airlines including BA, Air France, Lufthansa and Aer Lingus
to reduce their unjustified fuel surcharges to reflect the recent 38% drop in
oil prices.
Speaking at today's AGM, Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary said:
"While the recent fall in oil prices is welcome, it won't have much impact on
our full year results because we have already hedged Q.3 at $124 per barrel and
any Q.4 fuel savings may be absorbed by lower fares and yields as we stimulate
growth in a recession this Winter. We believe there will be further airline
bankruptcies in Europe over the coming weeks, as more of Europe's non-viable,
loss making airlines run out of cash or their credit facilities are withdrawn.
"The extraordinary pace of European airline consolidation will also continue.
There is no doubt that most of Europe's flag carrier airlines will merge into
three large high fare groupings led by BA, Air France and Lufthansa this Winter.
By contrast Ryanair will continue to compete with (and beat) these mega carriers
by offering lower fares, consumer choice and better punctuality. We expect that
the European Commission will rubber-stamp approval of these mergers, which will
help Ryanair's appeal against the EU's prohibition of our 2006 much smaller
Ryanair Holdings PLC AGM Statement
merger with Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus (which is again losing money) is far too
small to survive as an independent regional airline, and we believe its future
can best be secured as part of one strong Irish airline group (where it would
continue to be separately branded and managed), rather than being a tiny
subsidiary of a high fare airline grouping controlled from London, Paris or
Frankfurt.
"We regret Aer Lingus's continuing failure to take Ryanair's
advice to lower its fares, fuel surcharges or costs. Having wasted over EUR24m of
shareholders funds rejecting an offer of EUR2.80 per share, Aer Lingus is now
forecasting substantial losses both in 2008 and 2009. Its Belfast base with an
average load factor of less than 50% has been a financial failure. We don't
believe that a Board which has almost trebled its Directors fees from EUR17,500
p.a. to EUR45,000 p.a. can credibly deliver the "fundamental changes in the
operating cost base" which are so badly needed. Perhaps they should start by
cutting these fat cat fees? Aer Lingus's future and the security of employment
of its people depends on lowering air fares and scrapping unjustified fuel
surcharges, whereas in the last two years Aer Lingus has increased both.
"Ryanair supports the UK Competition Commission's recent report which called for
the break up of the BAA airport monopoly which has damaged competition and
consumer interests in the UK. We call on the Irish Government to break up the
equally damaging DAA airport monopoly which continues to develop facilities
which users don't want, and continues to impose monopoly prices increases, way
above the rate of inflation, while Ireland's useless Aviation Regulator stands
idly by. We call again for the dismissal of Ireland's Aviation Regulator who has
failed to protect the interests of users at Dublin Airport, who did nothing
while Dublin's ATC system collapsed for 5 weeks earlier this Summer, and who has
presided over a growing number of bankruptcies of tour operator and airlines
which his office licenced as financially fit to operate. Ireland's Aviation
Regulator has been a dismal failure, and this useless quango should be closed
immediately.
Ryanair Holdings PLC AGM Statement
"Ryanair's campaign against illegal screen-scraper/ticket-tout websites (who are
unlawfully accessing Ryanair.com's website and are mis-selling Ryanair's fares
to consumers with hidden 200% and 300% mark-ups) continues. We note the failure
of the European Commission, or the consumer protection agencies of Ireland, the
UK or Europe to take any action to prevent consumers being ripped off with
these hidden mark-ups. Ryanair is continuing, to secure injunctions in Ireland,
the UK, Spain and Germany against these mis-selling ticket-touts and
cancel screen-scraper bookings which have been made in breach of Ryanair's terms
and conditions.
"Ryanair continues to grow strongly, with last month's traffic up 19% on August
2007. We expect that our continuous stream of seat sales and price promotions
which includes this morning's release of 5 million, EUR5 seats for travel in
October and the first two weeks of November, will continue to stimulate air
travel, to take market share from competitors and offer Europe's consumers a
real choice of low fares and on-time flights, when increasingly their only
alternative is high fare, fuel surcharging, regularly delayed flag carrier
services. While Ryanair's refusal to impose fuel surcharges will mean that our
profitability declines steeply in the current fiscal year, our cost reduction
programme and significantly lower oil prices (if they persist at under $100
p.bl) should lead to a return to substantial profitability in the next fiscal
year (ended March 2010)".

Meeting with Ryanair
Dublin, London, 7 January: Aer Lingus today confirmed they met yesterday with
 representatives of Ryanair. Aer Lingus explained to Ryanair at the meeting how
 the bid fundamentally undervalues the airline, its robust financial position,
 ignores the substantial competition issues and is therefore not capable of
 completion.

 MAXIMA RNS RELEASE: ("Maxima" or "the company")
 Maxima Holdings plc (AIM: MXM), the IT business systems and managed services company, has announced 
further sales successes for its Business Solutions and Unified Infrastructure operations, with contracts from Amtico 
International to host and manage core business IT applications, and with Ryanair to support the airline's business-
critical web booking application using Citrix's latest web acceleration technology.
 Accelerating web booking performance for Ryanair Maxima is Ireland's leading Citrix Solution Adviser, and has 
implemented seven Citrix NetScaler MPX 9500 hardware appliances to enhance server load balancing, improve 
web traffic management, increase security levels and substantially lower Ryanair's online operating costs. Maxima 
is also supporting the NetScaler implementation with a three-year support agreement, and is also providing ongoing 
day-to-day support for Ryanair's broader Citrix-enabled virtualisation infrastructure. According to Ryanair's IT 
Director, Eric Neville: "Online booking is obviously a critical service for Ryanair - particularly as our traffic volumes 
continue to grow - so it's essential that our Web infrastructure performs to the highest level. Having assessed the 
market it was clear that Maxima not only had the in-depth expertise in Citrix's core web acceleration technologies, 
but also had the proven implementation skills and competitive prices we required."
 Hosting and managing core business IT applications for Amtico International Amtico International - the driving force 
behind some of the world's leading flooring brands - has selected Maxima to host and manage its core IT systems, 
including its business-critical QAD Enterprise Applications and the company's office software, within a secure 
hosted Maxima environment. Maxima's combination of hosting capabilities and its in-depth expertise in QAD 
Enterprise Applications, will help deliver lower operating costs and increased flexibility for Amtico's major ERP 
deployment. "We're confident that Maxima's specialist enterprise applications team will help us to manage our 
Microsoft applications and specialist ERP solution more effectively, while the company's best practice hosting 
infrastructure will allow us to optimise the running of our QAD Enterprise Applications - helping us to increase our IT

agility, and reduce the risks associated with owning and operating complex enterprise applications across the 
broader Amtico business," said Amtico International's Group Finance Director, Andrew Elsby-Smith. Maxima Chief 
Executive Officer Graham Kingsmill added:"We're delighted that major organisations such as Amtico International 
and Ryanair are leveraging our comprehensive skills and expertise in key areas such as hosting, managed 
services, application deployment, cloud and virtualisation. These contracts highlight Maxima's strength in our key 
Business Solutions and Unified Infrastructure areas, as well as our ability to leverage our strong relationships with 
key technology partners."

 --    Aer Lingus entered into a conditional agreement with the IASS Trustee dated 11 September 2014 and a 
memorandum of understanding with trade unions representing Aer Lingus staff dated 15 September 2014;
 --    Aer Lingus, DAA and the IASS Trustee commenced an extensive communications exercise for current and 
former employees on 24 September 2014. This exercise comprised detailed proposal guides, personal 
illustrations, information website and interactive question and answer sessions;
 --    A consultation period, during which IASS members could provide feedback to the IASS Trustee also 
commenced on 24 September 2014 and ended on 27 October 2014. The IASS Trustee will consider feedback 
received for a period which is expected to end on 15 November 2014; and
 --    Trade unions representing Aer Lingus staff have conducted a member ballot on the proposed IASS 
solution, the results of which are expected imminently.
 Despite the above steps, the implementation of the proposed IASS solution is a complex process and there 
remains a risk of unexpected delay or other unanticipated issues arising.
 Subject to a positive outcome of the trade union ballot, Aer Lingus expects to issue a circular to 
shareholders in mid-November 2014 setting out full details of the proposed IASS solution. This will be 
followed by the convening of an extraordinary general meeting in mid-December 2014 to seek approval from 
shareholders to make proposed once-off payments totaling EUR190.7 million relating to the proposed IASS 
solution. If shareholder approval is received, the benefit reductions proposed by the IASS trustee will 
still need to be approved by the Pensions Authority in order for the proposed IASS solution to be fully 
implemented.
 The proposed IASS solution does not relate to the Irish Airlines' (Pilots) Superannuation Scheme (the 
"Pilots' Scheme"). Aer Lingus has engaged in discussions regarding the Pilots' Scheme with the trustee of 
the Pilots Scheme and IALPA. These parties have signed a funding proposal for submission to the Pensions 
Authority and this funding proposal does not involve any capital contribution by Aer Lingus either within 
the Pilots' Scheme or outside of the Pilots' Scheme. The trustee of the Pilots' Scheme is awaiting the 
decision of the Pensions Authority regarding the funding proposal.
Ryanair shareholding
 ---------------------
Ryanair's appeal in relation to the decision of the Competition Appeals Tribunal to the UK Court of Appeal will be 
heard on the 26 and 27 November 2014, with a judgement likely in the first quarter of 2015.

TBI plc
("TBI" or "the Group")
AGM Statement
TBI, the regional airports operator, is holding its AGM today at 12 noon. At
the meeting, G Stanley Thomas, Chairman, made the following comments to
shareholders:
"The current year has got off to a positive start and trading remains in line
with the Board's expectations against the background of a continued challenging
environment for both our airline customers and for airport operators generally.
"Total passenger numbers from our core European airports have continued to grow
in the first quarter across all three passenger groups, full service, charter
and low cost, predominantly driven by low cost. Traffic across the total Group,
including our American airports, was 4.9m in the first quarter, 11% higher than
TBI PLC AGM Statement
last year. This trend has continued throughout July.
"TBI remains at the forefront of the growth in budget air travel and continues
to attract additional low cost traffic to domestic and European destinations.
Last week saw announcements from easyJet and Ryanair in which both low cost
operators committed to significant expansion of their respective services out of
London Luton. easyJet will increase its capacity by 25% by adding three new
aircraft and similarly Ryanair will add four new aircraft and nine new routes.
Such substantial expansion at London Luton is particularly pleasing and is clear
recognition of this airport's current and future potential. The benefit of the
extra volumes will be realised in 2006.
"As announced on Monday, 26 July, MyTravel's continuing restructuring will
result in reductions to its network at several UK airports including Cardiff
International. Unless replaced by other capacity this would result, in 2005/6,
in a 10% reduction in Cardiff's passenger numbers. Our team at Cardiff
International is already making good progress in this regard.
"Recently, the Board highlighted its intention to dispose of the Group's non
core airport assets in Bolivia and its airport services business in the US.
Advisers have been instructed to facilitate the divestment of the Group's
Bolivian operations and this process is now underway. Similarly, the sales
process for the US airport services business is progressing and we are now in
receipt of indicative bids from interested parties.
"TBI has entered the current year on a sound footing to move the business
forward and the Board remains optimistic about the future for the Group."
                                                                    30 July 2004

Body
 State aid complaints by Lufthansa about Ryanair's cost base at Frankfurt (Hahn) have been rejected by German 
courts, as have similar complaints by Air Berlin in relation to Ryanair's arrangement with Lubeck airport, but 
following a German Supreme Court ruling on a procedural issue in early 2011, these cases will be re-heard by 
lower courts. In addition, Ryanair has been involved in legal challenges including allegations of state aid at Alghero 
and Marseille airports. The Alghero case (initiated by Air One) has been dismissed in its entirety in April 2011. The 
Marseille case has been withdrawn by the plaintiffs (subsidiaries of Air France) in May 2011.
 In September 2005, the European Commission announced new guidelines on the financing of airports and the 
provision of start-up aid to airlines departing from regional airports, based on the Commission's finding in the 
Brussels (Charleroi) case, which Ryanair successfully appealed. The guidelines apply only to publicly owned 
regional airports, and place restrictions on the incentives these airports can offer airlines to deliver traffic. The 
guidelines apply only in cases in which the terms offered by a public airport are in excess of what a similar private 
airport would have offered. Ryanair deals with airports, both public and private, on an equal basis and receives the 
same cost agreements from both. The guidelines have therefore had no impact on Ryanair's business, although 
they have caused significant uncertainty in the industry in relation to what public airports may or may not do in order 
to attract traffic.
 Ryanair believes that the positive decision by the CFI in the Charleroi case has caused the European Commission 
to rethink its policy in this area. Ryanair believes that the Court's findings should be addressed in the upcoming 
revision of the guidelines. However, adverse rulings in the above or similar cases could be used as precedents by 
other competitors to challenge Ryanair's agreements with other publicly owned airports and could cause Ryanair to 
strongly reconsider its growth strategy in relation to public or state-owned airports across Europe. This could in turn 
lead to a scaling back of Ryanair's growth strategy due to the smaller number of privately owned airports available 
for development. No assurance can be given as to the outcome of these proceedings, nor as to whether any 
unfavorable outcomes may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the results of 
operations or financial condition of the Company.
 In November 2007, Ryanair initiated proceedings in the CFI against the European Commission for its failure to take 
action on a number of state aid complaints Ryanair had submitted against Air France, Lufthansa, Alitalia, Volare 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -46-
and Olympic Airways. Following the Commission's subsequent findings that illegal state aid had been provided to 
Air France and Olympic Airways, Ryanair withdrew the two relevant proceedings. The case related to Lufthansa 
concluded with the EU General Court's ruling in May 2011, in which the Court found that while the European 
Commission has not failed to act, it has unreasonably delayed the launch of the investigation, which justified 
Ryanair's action for failure to act. Consequently, the Court ordered the Commission to pay 50% of Ryanair's costs 
in the proceedings. Ryanair is currently awaiting hearings in Alitalia case, following the withdrawal of the Volare 
case in August 2010.
 In November 2008, Ryanair initiated proceedings in the CFI contesting the European Commission's refusal to grant 
Ryanair access to documents relating to the Commission's state aid investigations at Hamburg (Lubeck), Tampere, 
Berlin (Schonefeld), Alghero, Pau, Aarhus, Bratislava and Frankfurt (Hahn) airports. These cases were heard on 
July 7, 2010 and a judgment was issued in December 2010. The CFI found that the European Commission has 
acted in line with applicable legislation, which highlighted the unfairness inherent in state aid procedures in the EU, 
whereby alleged beneficiaries of aid have no right of access to the Commission's file and therefore cannot properly 
exercise their rights to defense and good administration. The CFI ordered the Commission to pay Ryanair's costs in 
three of the eight access to documents cases.
 In March 2009, Ryanair also appealed (to the CFI) two decisions issued by the European Commission in 
November 2008 relating to the sale of Alitalia's assets to Compagnia Aerea Italiana (CAI) and to a EUR300 million 
rescue loan granted to Alitalia by the Italian government and subsequently converted into Alitalia's capital. A 
hearing in this case took place in June 2011 and judgment is expected in six to twelve months.
 Matters Related to Investment in Aer Lingus. During the 2007 fiscal year, the Company acquired 25.2% of Aer 
Lingus. The Company increased its interest to 29.3% during the 2008 fiscal year, and to 29.8% during the 2009 
fiscal year at a total aggregate cost of EUR407.2 million. Following the acquisition of its initial stake and upon the 
approval of the Company's shareholders, management proposed to effect a tender offer to acquire the entire share 
capital of Aer Lingus. This 2006 offer was, however, prohibited by the European Commission on competition 
grounds. Ryanair filed an appeal with the CFI, which was heard in July 2009. On July 6, 2010 the Court upheld the 
Commission's decision. (see also: "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Business Overview").
 The then EU Commissioner for Competition, Neelie Kroes, said on June 27, 2007 that, "Since Ryanair is not in a 
position to exert de jure or de facto control over Aer Lingus, the European Commission is not in a position to require 
Ryanair to divest its minority shareholding, which is, by the way, not a controlling stake." In October 2007, the 
European Commission also reached a formal decision that it would not force Ryanair to sell its shares in Aer 
Lingus. However, Aer Lingus appealed this decision before the CFI. In January 2008, the CFI heard an application 
by Aer Lingus for interim measures limiting Ryanair's voting rights, pending a decision of the CFI on Aer Lingus' 
appeal of the European Commission's decision not to force Ryanair to sell the Aer Lingus shares. In March 2008, 
the court dismissed Aer Lingus' application for interim measures. Aer Lingus' main appeal was heard in July 2009. 
On July 6, 2010 the court rejected Aer Lingus' appeal and confirmed that Ryanair cannot be forced to dispose of its 
29.8% stake in Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus had two months and 10 days from such date to appeal this judgment to the 
Court of Justice of the EU. In addition to the risk that the Court of Justice may overturn the lower court's ruling, 
should Aer Lingus choose to appeal it, EU legislation may change in the future to require such a forced disposition. 
If eventually forced to dispose of its stake in Aer Lingus, Ryanair could suffer significant losses due to the negative 
impact on attainable prices of the forced sale of such a significant portion of Aer Lingus' shares.
 On December 1, 2008, Ryanair made a second offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of Aer Lingus it did not 
own at a price of EUR1.40 per ordinary share. Ryanair offered to keep Aer Lingus as a separate company, maintain 
the Aer Lingus brand, and retain its Heathrow slots and connectivity. Ryanair also proposed to double Aer Lingus' 
short-haul fleet from 33 to 66 aircraft and to create 1,000 associated new jobs over a five-year period. If the offer 
had been accepted, the Irish government would have received over EUR180 million in cash. The employee share 
option trust and employees who owned 18% of Aer Lingus would have received over EUR137 million in cash. The 
Company met Aer Lingus management, representatives of the employee share option trust and other parties. The 
offer of EUR1.40 per share represented a premium of approximately 25% over the closing price of EUR1.12 of Aer 
Lingus on November 28, 2008. Ryanair also advised the market that it would not proceed to seek EU approval for 
the new bid unless the shareholders agreed to sell their stakes in Aer Lingus to Ryanair. However, as the Company 
was unable to secure the shareholders' support it decided, on January 28, 2009, to withdraw its new offer for Aer 
Lingus.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -46-
 The United Kingdom's Office of Fair Trading ("OFT") wrote to Ryanair in September 2010, advising that it intends 
to investigate Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair objected to this investigation on the basis that the 
OFT's investigation is time-barred. Ryanair maintains that the OFT had and missed the opportunity to investigate 
Ryanair's minority stake within four months from the European Commission's June 2007 decision to prohibit 
Ryanair's takeover of Aer Lingus. The OFT agreed in October 2010 to suspend its investigation pending the 
outcome of Ryanair's appeal against the OFT's decision that its investigation is not time barred. Ryanair is currently 
awaiting the judgment of the Competition Appeal Tribunal. If the OFT investigation proceeds, it may result in a 
referral to the Competition Commission. The Competition Commission could order Ryanair to divest some or all of 
its shares in Aer Lingus, as a result of which Ryanair could suffer significant losses due to the negative impact on 
attainable prices of the forced sale of such a significant portion of Aer Lingus' shares.

RYANAIR MINORITY STAKE IN AER LINGUS:
 OFT BELIEVES IT IS 'IN TIME' TO CONSIDER ACQUISITION
The OFT has today written to Ryanair Holdings plc setting out that it believes it is 'in-time' to review the company's 
acquisition of a minority interest in Aer Lingus Group plc, which was acquired over the period September 2006 to 
August 2007.
 The OFT opened its investigation into Ryanair's minority interest on 29 October 2010 following the conclusion of 
appeals of European Commission decisions relating to Ryanair's full bid for Aer Lingus and its retained minority 
shareholding.
 The OFT believes that it was unable to act in this matter until these appeals concluded because there was a risk of 
inconsistent outcomes between any actions taken by the OFT under the Enterprise Act 2002 in relation to Ryanair's 
minority stake and any action that the European Courts might require of the European Commission in relation to the 
minority stake or Ryanair's full bid for Aer Lingus. The OFT considers that to have opened an investigation under 
the Enterprise Act 2002, and to have thereby created a risk of inconsistent outcomes, would have been contrary to 
the duty of sincere co-operation set out in Article 4 of the Treaty on European Union.
 The OFT decided to set out its view on the discrete 'in time' aspect of this matter given the highly exceptional 
nature of the facts in this case and the procedural benefits in addressing this point upfront.
 Sheldon Mills, Director of Mergers at the OFT, said:
 'The OFT opened an investigation into Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus because it believes that it potentially 
raises competition concerns.
Office of Fair Trading Merger Update
 'We recognise that this case raises important legal and policy issues in relation to whether competition authorities 
should be able to apply national merger control legislation whilst related appeals are ongoing under the EC Merger 
Regulation. We believe that an interpretation of the law that could lead to inconsistent outcomes at national and 
European level risks undermining the coherence of merger control in the EU.
 'We have considered this issue carefully and it is appropriate and fair to Ryanair to inform them, at this point, that 
we believe we are 'in time' to review the minority stake.'
 NOTES
 1. Ryanair Holdings plc currently owns 29.82 per cent of Aer Lingus Group plc. Ryanair initially acquired a stake in 
Aer Lingus in late-2006. It mounted a public bid for the entire shareholding in Aer Lingus in October 2006. The 
European Commission investigated the public bid and decided to prohibit it in June 2007. The General Court upheld 
the prohibition of the public bid and ruled in July 2010 that the European Commission does not have the ability to 
examine or require divestment of minority shareholdings that do not confer 'decisive influence' for the purposes of 
the EC Merger Regulation - see Note 4). As such, Member States were free to apply their own national rules to the 
minority stake if they had those powers. The appeal period for review of the General Court judgments expired on 20 
September 2010.
 2. The reference test - the OFT has a duty to make a reference to the Competition Commission if it believes that it 
is or may be the case that a relevant merger situation has been created, and the creation of that situation has 
resulted, or may be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the 
United Kingdom for goods or services.
 3. Under the Enterprise Act 2002 a relevant merger situation is created if two or more enterprises have ceased to 
be distinct enterprises; and the value of the turnover in the United Kingdom of the enterprise being taken over 
exceeds GBP70 million; or as a result of the transaction, in relation to the supply of goods or services of any 
description, a 25 per cent share of supply in the UK (or a substantial part thereof) is created or enhanced.
 4. Minority stakes - Under the Enterprise Act 2002 the OFT may treat as a relevant merger situation a minority 
shareholding where that shareholding gives its owner the ability materially to influence the behaviour and policy of 
the target company including the target company's strategic direction and commercial objectives. As stated in the 
OFT's Mergers - jurisdictional and procedural guidance(OFT527, paragraph 3.15) 'material influence' is a lower 
level of control than the 'decisive influence' test used by the European Commission under the EC Merger 
Regulation. In BSkyB/ITV, BSkyB's acquisition of a 17.9 per cent share in ITV was ultimately found by the 
Competition Commission and the Secretary of State to give rise to a substantial lessening of competition such as to 
require remedial action.
 5. Under the Enterprise Act 2002 the OFT is able to refer to the Competition Commission completed relevant 
mergers within four months of the merger's completion or from the time material facts about the merger were made 
public. However, section 122 of the Enterprise Act 2002 provides that the duty to refer applies outside this four 
month timetable when the reference could not have been made earlier because of anything done under or in 
accordance with the EC Merger Regulation.
 6. The full text of this decision will appear in the mergers section of this website at a later date.

 Independent Auditor's Report to the members of Ryanair Holdings plc
 We have audited the consolidated and Company financial statements ("financial statements") of Ryanair 
Holdings plc for the year ended March 31, 2012, which comprise the consolidated and Company balance 
sheets, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated and Company statements of changes in shareholders' equity, the consolidated and Company 
statements of cash flows and the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the 
accounting policies set out therein.
 This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Section 193 of the 
Companies Act, 1990 and in respect of the separate opinion in relation to International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), on terms 
that have been agreed. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members 
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and in respect of the separate 
opinion in relation to IFRSs, as issued by the IASB, those matters that we have agreed to state to them in 
our report, and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
 Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
 The directors' responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union (EU), and their separate 
responsibilities for electing to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as 
issued by the IASB, are set out in the Statement of Directors Responsibilities on pages 28 to 29.
 Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (United Kingdom and Ireland).
 We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as issued by the IASB and, have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012 and, in the case of the consolidated financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
 We also report to you, in our opinion; whether proper books of account have been kept by the Company; 
whether at the balance sheet date, there exists a financial situation requiring the convening of an 
extraordinary general meeting of the Company under Section 40(1) of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983; 
and whether the information given in the Directors' Report is consistent with the financial statements.  
In addition, we state whether we have obtained all the information and explanations necessary for the 
purposes of our audit, and whether the Company balance sheet is in agreement with the books of account.
 We also report to you if, in our opinion, any information specified by law or the Listing Rules of the 
Irish Stock Exchange regarding directors' remuneration and transactions is not disclosed and, where 
practicable, include such information in our report.
 We are required by law to report to you our opinion as to whether the description of the main features of 
the internal control and risk management systems in relation to the process for preparing the consolidated 
group financial statements, set out in the annual Corporate Governance Statement is consistent with the 
consolidated financial statements. In addition, we review whether the Corporate Governance Statement 
reflects the Company's compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code and two 
provisions of the Irish Corporate Governance annex specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the 
Irish Stock Exchange, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board's 
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the Company's corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
 We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with 
the audited financial statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman's and Chief 
Executive's Reports; the Corporate Governance Report; the Operating and Financial Review; Principle Risks 
and Uncertainties; Critical Accounting Policies; Directors, Senior Management and Employees; Major 
Shareholders and Related Party Transactions; and the Directors' Report. We consider the implications for 
our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial 
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
 Basis of audit opinion
 We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (United Kingdom and 
Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of 
evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  It also includes an 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -10-
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the 
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group's and Company's 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
 We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we 
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or 
error.  In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information 
in the financial statements.
 Opinion
 In our opinion:
 --    the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU, of the state of the Group's affairs as at March 31, 2012 and of its profit for the year 
then ended;
 --    the Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2012 of the state of 
the Company's affairs as at March 31, 2012;
 --    the consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Acts, 1963 to 2012 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
 --    The Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Acts, 
1963 to 2012.

The Company has not disclosed the fair value for financial liabilities such as trade payables and accrued 
expenses because their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of their fair values due to the 
short term nature of the instruments.
 Estimation of fair values
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Company's financial 
instruments:
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --           Available-for- sale: The fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is their quoted 
market bid price at the balance sheet date. (Level 1)

               CLARIFICATION OF STATEMENTS MADE IN DEFENCE CIRCULAR
The Irish Takeover Panel has ruled that the reference to EBITDAR estimates for
2007 together with the imputed multiple for Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus")
referred to on page 18 of the circular published by Aer Lingus on 3 November
2006 (the "Circular") constituted a profit forecast for the purposes of Rule 28
of the Irish Takeover Rules. The Participating Directors confirm that it was
not their intention that this reference be regarded as a profit forecast and
they are therefore withdrawing it. The intention of the Participating Directors
in including this reference was only to illustrate that the offer made by
Ryanair values Aer Lingus at a significant discount to Ryanair and Aer Lingus'
European peer group.

 GOVERNMENT SHOULD EXPLAIN WHY IT REJECTED RYANAIR'S DEC 2008 OFFER,
 WHICH WOULD HAVE CREATED 1,000 NEW JOBS IN AER LINGUS,
 WHEN YESTERDAY THEY ANNOUNCE 670 JOB LOSSES
Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline today (Thursday, 8th October 2009) called
 on the Department of Transport, to explain why it rejected Ryanair's December
 2008 offer for Aer Lingus, which guaranteed to double the size of Aer Lingus'
 short-haul fleet and create 1,000 new jobs in the airline over a 5 year period,
 when yesterday the Board of Aer Lingus, which is controlled by the Irish
 Government and the trade unions announced 670 jobs losses, as well as pay and
 pension cuts in Aer Lingus.
Ryanair's Dec 2008 offer document for Aer Lingus guaranteed to double Aer
 Lingus' short-haul fleet from 30 to over 60 aircraft, create 1,000 new jobs for
 pilots, cabin crew and engineers over a 5 year period, while at the same time
 reducing Aer Lingus' fares, removing its fuel surcharges, securing its brand,
 Heathrow slots and connectivity.
Ryanair's offer would also have provided Aer Lingus with a strong financial
 partner, at a time when all other airlines across Europe are collapsing or
 consolidating into one of the big four European airlines led by Air France, BA,
Ryanair Holdings PLC Response to Aer Lingus Announcement
 Lufthansa and Ryanair.
Since the Minister for Transport rejected Ryanair's Dec 2008 offer, Aer Lingus
 has:
*  Announced record losses of over EUR100m for 2008.
 *  Guided increased losses in 2009.
 *  Seen its long-haul traffic collapse.
 *  Seen its net cash balances fall from over EUR800m, to less than EUR400m.
 *  Yesterday announced over 670 jobs losses, and pay and pension cuts.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
"Yesterday's announcement of widespread job losses and pay cuts in Aer Lingus is
 further evidence of the incompetence of Ireland's Department of Transport. Since
 they rejected Ryanair's second offer for Aer Lingus last January, the Irish
 Government and the trade unions have controlled the Board of Aer Lingus and have
 spectacularly mismanaged it. Aer Lingus' share price has collapsed, its losses
 have exploded, its transatlantic business is in freefall and now they have
 announced over 670 job losses, together with pay and pension cuts, when just 10
 months ago they rejected  an offer of guaranteed investment, growth and 1,000
 new jobs in Aer Lingus.
"The Department of Transport should now explain to Aer Lingus shareholders, and
 the 670 Aer Lingus workers who are facing redundancy why they rejected an offer
 from the world's largest international airline, which would have doubled the
 size of the short-haul fleet  and created up to 1,000 new jobs at the airline,
 while securing  the future of Aer Lingus, its brand, and its connectivity. The
 sooner the dead hand of the Department of Transport and its corrupt Civil
 Service is removed from the transport sector in Ireland, the better it will
 function in the interests of consumers.
"Ryanair believes there is a bright future for Aer Lingus, but it will never be
 achieved while it is mismanaged by a bunch of political and trade union hacks on
 the Aer Lingus Board".

             IT'S OFFICIAL - RYANAIR IS NO. 1 FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline today (Wednesday, 22nd February 2006)
welcomed the just released AEA and Ryanair figures for customer service in 2005.
Speaking today, Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications said:
        "The comparison between AEA, Ryanair and Easyjet customer service
         statistics clearly shows that for the third year in a row Ryanair is the
         most punctual major airline in Europe with the most on time flights, the
         fewest cancellations and least lost bags.
        "The report confirms:
          Flights:         During 2005, nearly 3 in 10 passengers
                            who chose British Airways were delayed compared
                            to just 1 out of 10 with Ryanair.
          Mislaid bags:    During 2005, 35 passengers in
                            every 2,000 flying with British Airways had
                            their bag mislaid compared to just 1 in every
                            2,000 with Ryanair.
          Cancellations:   During 2005, 12 in every 800
                            British Airways flights were cancelled, compared
                            to less than 5 in every 800 with Ryanair.
        "The report also confirms what millions of European consumers already

         on-times, fly Ryanair".

Ryanair Holdings PLC
11 March 2008
                RYANAIR RESPONDS TO FURTHER EVIDENCE OF EU BIAS
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Tuesday, 11th March 2008)
responded to further evidence of the European Commission's bias in applying one
set of rules for high fare flag carriers and another set of discriminatory rules
for Ryanair.
The European Commission announced today that it will investigate Ryanair's open,
pro competitive deal at Bratislava Airport. The Commission's investigation is
based on a spurious complaint by "a competitor", likely either Austrian Airlines
or Vienna Airport in order to block competition from Ryanair and Bratislava
airport. The investigation is completely baseless and coming on the eve of
Ryanair's appeal of the Commission's unlawful Charleroi Decision in the European
Court of First Instance is a pathetic attempt to put pressure on the Court.
The European Commission's unlawful Charleroi decision has already been used by
Ryanair Holdings PLC Evidence of EU Bias
high fares airlines and high cost airports to launch spurious complaints against
small regional airports such as Tampere, Aarhus, Alghero, Lubeck, Pau and now
Bratislava, despite the fact that the complaining high fare airlines have no
intention of ever flying to these regional airports. They simply want to block
the growth of these regional airports, block low fares, competition and choice.
Ryanair is appealing the Commission's flawed and unlawful Charleroi ruling in
the European Court of First Instance tomorrow and is confident it will be
overturned.
While the Commission responds rapidly to these baseless complaints from
Competitor airlines/ airports, it is doing nothing at all to investigate and
address the serious multi billion euro state aid subsidies to flag carrier
airlines (Air France, Alitalia, Lufthansa and Olympic). The European
Commission's lack of action over these serious state aid cases, has now forced
Ryanair to take separate cases against the Commission in the European Court of
First Instance, to compel the Commission to apply its own state aid rules fairly
and without discrimination against Ryanair.

 Olympic                 Dec '06              No Action
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan said:
        "This baseless and spurious investigation in Bratislava is just the
         latest example of the EU applying one set of rules for flag carrier
         airlines and another discriminatory set of rules for Ryanair and is a
         pathetic attempt by the European Commission to put pressure on the
         European Court of First Instance on the eve of the Charleroi appeal
         hearing.
        "We are confident that the CFI will overturn the Commission's patently
         flawed, anti competitive Charleroi decision and call on the Commission
         to stop ignoring or signing off on continuing unlawful State aid for the
         inefficient high fare flag carrier airlines while pursuing baseless
         complaints by flag carriers against low fares airlines operating out of
Ryanair Holdings PLC Evidence of EU Bias
         regional and secondary airports.
        "This discriminatory twin track approach must end. It is time for the
         Commission to start promoting competition and consumer choice, and end
         unlawful State aid to flag carrier airlines".

 At a time when airlines in Europe and further afield are merging to form bigger competition champions 
(witness American Airlines' merger with US Airways last week and Emirates' recent strategic joint-venture 
with Qantas) the EU Commission has yet again set back competition and choice in Europe while delaying 
much-needed consolidation.
 This decision leaves Aer Lingus as a small, isolated airline and leaves the two Irish airlines at the 
mercy of the Government-owned Dublin Airport monopoly, which continues to increase passenger charges, 
deliver third-rate services and oversee traffic declines.  Over the past 5 years, as Dublin Airport has 
doubled its passenger charges, its traffic has declined from 24m to 18m per annum, while Aer Lingus 
continues to get smaller as it: (1) wet leases short-haul jet aircraft to Virgin to operate new routes 
from Heathrow to regional UK airports (making no contribution to Irish tourism); (2) rents long-haul 
aircraft to charter companies outside of Ireland; and (3) transfers more and more of its short-haul routes 
to smaller, turbo-prop aircraft.
 Ryanair regrets that the EU Commission has again failed to apply its own competition rules and precedents 
in a fair and dispassionate manner.  We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow 
political interests rather than competition concerns and we believe that we have strong grounds for 
appealing and overturning this politically-inspired prohibition. Accordingly, Ryanair has instructed its 
legal advisers to prepare a comprehensive appeal against this manifestly unjust prohibition."

Exceptional items
 The Company presents certain items separately, which are unusual, by virtue of their size and incidence, in the 
context of our ongoing core operations, as we believe this presentation represents the underlying business more 
accurately and reflects the manner in which investors typicallyanalyse the results. Any amounts deemed 
"exceptional" for management discussion and analysis purposes, in the Chairman's Report and Chief Executive's 
Report, have been classified for the purposes of the income statement in the same way as non-exceptional 
amounts of the same nature.
 There were no exceptional items in the year ended March 31, 2013.
 Exceptional items in the year ended March 31, 2012 relate to a one-off release of ticket sales revenue of EUR57.8 
million, net of tax, due to a change in accounting estimates arising from enhancements to our Revenue Accounting 
System.
 Profit after tax increased by 13% to EUR569.3 million compared to adjusted profit after tax excluding exceptional 
items of EUR502.6 million in the year ended March 31, 2012. Including exceptional items the profit after tax for the 
year increased by 2% from EUR560.4 million in the year ended March 31, 2012 compared to a profit of EUR569.3 
million in the year ended March 31, 2013.
 Summary year ended March 31, 2013
 Profit after tax increased by 13% to EUR569.3 million compared to EUR502.6 million in the year ended March 31, 
2012 primarily due to a 6% increase in average fares and strong ancillary revenues, offset by an 18% increase in 
fuel costs. Total operating revenues increased by 13% to EUR4,884.0 million as average fares rose by 6%. 
Ancillary revenues grew by 20%, faster than the 5% increase in passenger numbers, to EUR1,064.2 million due to 
a combination of improved product mix and the roll out of reserved seating across the network. Total revenue per 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -3-
passenger, as a result, increased by 8%, whilst Load Factor remained flat at 82% compared to the year ended 
March 31, 2012.
 Total operating expenses increased by 12% to EUR4,165.8 million, primarily due to an increase in fuel prices, the 
higher level of activity,  operating costs associated with the growth of the airline, and the strength of UK pounds 
sterling to the euro. Fuel, which represents 45% of total operating costs compared to 43% in the prior year, 
increased by 18% to EUR1,885.6 million due to the higher price per gallon paid and increased activity in the year.  
Unit costs excluding fuel increased by 3%, including fuel cost per passenger ("unit costs")  rose by 8%.  Operating 
margin increased by 1 point to 15% whilst operating profit increased by 16% to EUR718.2 million.
 Net margin remained flat at 12%, compared to March 31, 2012.
 Basic earnings per share for the year were 39.45 euro cent compared to basic earnings per share of 34.10 euro 
cent at March 31, 2012.

 Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as adopted by the EU
 ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full annual
 financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent
 published consolidated financial statements of the Group. The consolidated
 financial statements of the Group as at and for the year ended March 31, 2009
 are available at www.ryanair.com.
 The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2010 do not
 constitute statutory financial statements of the Group within the meaning of
 Regulation 40 of the European Communities (Companies, Group Accounts)
 Regulations, 1992.  The consolidated financial statements of the Groupfor the
 year ended March 31, 2010, together with the independent auditor's report
 thereon, will be filed with the Irish Registrar of Companies following the
 Company's Annual General Meeting and will also be available on the Company's
 website. Statutory financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2009 have
 been filed with the Companies' Office.  The auditors' report on those financial
 statements was unqualified.
The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors,
 approved the interim financial statements for the three months ended June 30,
 2010 on July 19, 2010.
Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been
 prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most
Ryanair Holdings PLC First Quarter Results -9-
 recent published consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in
 accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and in compliance with IFRS as issued
 by the International Accounting Standards Board.
There were no new standards, interpretations or amendments to existing standards
 adopted for the first time in the financial year 2010, which would have a
 material impact on our financial position or results from operations.
The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be
 adopted for purposes of the preparation of future financial statements, where
 applicable. We do not anticipate that the adoption of these new or revised
 standards and interpretations will have a material impact on our financial
 position or results from operations.
·      IFRS 3 (revised 2008), "Business Combinations" (effective for new
 acquisitions occurring in financial years beginning on or after July 1, 2009).
 ·      IFRIC 19, "Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments"
 (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after July 1, 2010).
 ·      IAS 24 (revised 2009), "Related Party Disclosures" (effective for fiscal
 periods beginning on or after January 1, 2011).
 ·      Amendments to IFRIC 14, "IAS 19 - The Limit on a Defined Benefit Assets,
 Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction" (effective for fiscal
 periods beginning on or after January 1, 2011).
 ·      IFRS 9, "Financial Instruments" (effective for fiscal periods beginning
 on or after January 1, 2013).
 ·      The IASB's third annual improvements project, "Improvements to
 International Financial Reporting Standards 2010", published on May 6, 2010
 (effective dates are dealt with on a standard-by-standard basis).
Exceptional items
 The Company presents certain items separately, which are unusual, by virtue of
 their size and incidence, in the context of our ongoing core operations, as we
 believe this presentation represents the underlying business more accurately and
 reflects the manner in which investors typically analyse the results.  In the
 current and prior period comparative we have presented the estimated costs
 relating to the closure of European air space due to the Icelandic volcanic ash
 disruptions as an exceptional item.  In the prior period comparative we have
 presented the impairment of our investment in Aer Lingus separately because of
 the unusual nature of these items.  Any amounts deemed "exceptional" for
 management discussion and analysis purposes have been classified for the
 purposes of the IFRS income statement in the same way as non exceptional amounts
 of the same nature.
2.  Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements,
 estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.  Actual
 results may differ from these estimates.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements
 made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key
Ryanair Holdings PLC First Quarter Results -9-
 sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the
 most recent published consolidated financial statements.
3.  Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to
 quarter, and management expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors
 causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to general
 economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly the
 first half-year typically results in substantially higher revenues and results.
4.  Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the
 quarter ended June 30, 2010 was 10.4% (2009:  8.6%).  The tax charge for the
 quarter ended June 30, 2010 of EUR10.9m (2009: EUR11.6m) primarily comprises of a
 deferred tax charge relating to temporary differences for property, plant and
 equipment recognised in the income statement and the utilisation of previous
 trading losses.
5.  Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most
 recent published consolidated financial statements.  The charge to the income
 statement in the year of approximately EUR1.2m (2009: EUR1.6m) is related to the
 fair value of various share options granted in prior periods, which are being
 recognised within the income statement in accordance with employee services
 rendered.
6.  Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its
 business.  The Group does not believe that any such litigation will individually
 or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
 Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, management
 believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not
 expected to materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or
 financial position.
7.  Capital commitments
 At June 30, 2010 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 250 (2009: 196) Boeing
 737-800 aircraft.  It also had firm orders for an additional 72 Boeing
 737-800's.  The delivery of these firm order aircraft will increase the fleet
 size (net of planned disposals) to 299 aircraft by March 31, 2013.
8.  Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR116.2m at March 31,
 2010 to EUR129.0m at June 30, 2010 is comprised of a gain of EUR12.8m, recognised
 through other comprehensive income, reflecting the increase in the share price
 from EUR0.73 per share at March 31, 2010 to EUR0.81 per share at June 30, 2010.  All
Ryanair Holdings PLC First Quarter Results -9-
 impairment losses are required to be recognised in the income statement and are
 not subsequently reversed, while gains are recognised through other
 comprehensive income.
9.  Analysis of operating segment
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares
 airline-related services, including scheduled services, car hire services,
 internet and other related services to third parties across a European route
 network.   The Company operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed
 through a single route scheduling system.
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information
 that internally is provided to Michael O'Leary, CEO, who is the Company's Chief
 Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource allocation decisions the
 CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation
 decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the
 entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in type.  The objective in making
 resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial results,
 rather than individual routes within the network.
The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated
 adjusted profit/(loss) after tax of the Company for the year. This measure
 excludes the effects of certain income and expense items, which are unusual, by
 virtue of their size and incidence, in the context of the Company's ongoing core
 operations, such as the costs relating to the closure of airspace in April and
 May 2010 due to the Icelandic volcanic ash disruptions and the impairment of a
 financial asset investment (see reconciliation on page 13).
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company
 has a single reportable segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which
 is flexibly employed across the Company's integrated route network and is
 directly attributable to its reportable segment operations.  In addition, as the
 Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and liabilities
 have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
 Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

 Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results for the 
remainder of the year are the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, 
costs associated with environmental, safety and security measures, terrorist events, actions of the Irish, UK, 
European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, fluctuations in currency 
exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour relations, the economic environment of the 
airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the UK, and Continental Europe, the general 
willingness of passengers to travel, other economic, social and political factors and flight interruptions caused by 
volcanic ash emissions or other atmospheric disruptions.

 Going concern
 After making enquiries and considering the Group's principal risks and uncertainties and its financial 
position and cash flows, the directors have formed a judgment, at the time of approving the interim 
financial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group as a whole 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least twelve months from 
the date of approval of the interim financial statements. For this reason, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the interim financial statements.
 Ryanair Holdings plc
 Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
 Interim Financial Statements
 1.            Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The unaudited condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
 These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the interim financial statements"), 
which should be read in conjunction with our 2015 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2015, have 
been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as 
adopted by the EU ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full annual 
financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2015, are available at http://investor.ryanair.com/
 The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2015 do not constitute statutory financial 
statements of the Group within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2014. The consolidated financial 
statements of the Group for the year ended March 31, 2015, together with the independent auditor's report 
thereon, have been filed with the Irish Registrar of Companies following the Company's Annual General 
Meeting and are also available on the Company's Website.  The auditor's report on those financial 
statements was unqualified.
 The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the interim 
financial statements for the nine month period ended December 31, 2015 on January 29, 2016.
 Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
 The following new and amended standards, that have been issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB), and are effective under those standards for the first time for the current financial year 
beginning on or after January 1, 2015, and have also been endorsed by the EU, have been applied by the 
Group for the first time in these condensed consolidated financial statements;
 --      Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions (Amendments to IAS 19) (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after July 1, 2014).*
 --      "Annual Improvements to IFRSs". 2010-2012 Cycle (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after July 1, 2014).*
 --      "Annual Improvements to IFRSs". 2011-2013 Cycle (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after July 1, 2014).
 * These standards or amendments to standards have been EU endorsed and have an effective date for periods 
beginning after February 1, 2015 or can be early adopted.
 The adoption of these new or amended standards did not have a material impact on our financial position 
or results from operations in the nine month period ended December 31, 2015.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -6-
 Exceptional item The Group presents certain items separately, which are unusual, by virtue of their size 
and incidence, in the context of our ongoing core operations, as we believe this presentation represents 
the underlying business more accurately and reflects the manner in which investors typically analyse the 
results. Any amounts deemed exceptional for management discussion and analysis purposes have been 
classified for the purposes of the income statement in the same way as non-exceptional amounts of the same 
nature.
 The exceptional item in the nine months ended December 31, 2015 relates to a one-off gain on disposal of 
our 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus (see note 8).
 2.            Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements made by 
management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were 
the same as those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.            Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.            Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the nine months ended December 
31, 2015 was 11.8% (December 31, 2014: 12.3%).  The tax charge for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 
of EUR159.2M (December 31, 2014: EUR117.9M) comprises a current tax charge of EUR147.1M and a deferred tax 
charge of EUR12.1M relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment recognised in 
the income statement.
 5.            Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR4.6M is the fair value of various share options 
granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in accordance with 
employee services rendered.
 6.            Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.

                   LUFTHANSA INCREASES FUEL SURCHARGES BY 21%
             EUROPE'S FUEL SURCHARGING AIRLINES SET TO FOLLOW SUIT
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Tuesday, 11th March 2008)
predicted that Europe's high fare airlines will begin another round of
unjustified fuel surcharge increases following Lufthansa's decision yesterday to
increase its short haul fuel surcharges by 21%. Lufthansa now charges passengers
EUR17 per short haul flight and EUR77 on long haul flights despite the fact it is
hedged at well below current market rates for oil. Ryanair is the only airline
in Europe to guarantee passengers no fuel surcharges ever.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Peter Sherrard said,
"Passengers can expect another raft of unjustified fuel surcharge increases from
Air France, Alitalia, British Airways and Iberia in the coming weeks. All of
these airlines are hedged at well below current market rates for oil but all of
Ryanair Holdings PLC Lufthansa Surcharge Increase
them charge unjustified fuel levies and will use every possible opportunity to
increase their surcharges. Lufthansa increased its fuel surcharges by another
21% yesterday and it will not be long before Europe's other fuel surcharging
high fare airlines follow suit.
"The only way for passengers to avoid this fuel surcharge scam is to fly
Ryanair, Europe's only airline to guarantee no fuel surcharges ever".

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Operating and Financial Overview
 Introduction
 For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") all figures and comments are by 
reference to the adjusted income statement excluding the prior year exceptional item referred to below.  A 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -4-
reconciliation of the results for the year under IFRS to the pre exceptional results is provided in Note 
9.
 There were no exceptional items in the year ended March 31, 2013.  The exceptional item in the year ended 
March 31, 2012 relates to a one-off release of ticket sales revenue of EUR57.8m, net of tax, due to a 
change in accounting estimates arising from enhancements to our Revenue Accounting Systems.
 Profit after tax in the year ended March 31, 2013 increased by 13% to EUR569.3m compared to adjusted 
profit after tax in the year ended March 31, 2012.  Including exceptional items, the profit after tax for 
the year increased by 2% from EUR560.4m to EUR569.3m.
 Summary year ended March 31, 2013
 Profit after tax increased by 13% to EUR569.3m compared to EUR502.6m in the year ended March 31, 2012 
primarily due to a 6% increase in average fares and strong ancillary revenues, offset by an 18% increase 
in fuel costs. Total operating revenues increased by 13% to EUR4,884.0m as average fares rose by 6%.  
Ancillary revenues grew by 20%, faster than the 5% increase in passenger numbers, to EUR1,064.2m due to a 
combination of an improved product mix and the roll out of reserved seating across the network.  Total 
revenue per passenger, as a result, increased by 8% whilst Load Factor remained flat at 82% compared to 
the year ended March 31, 2012.
 Total operating expenses increased by 12% to EUR4,165.8m, primarily due to an increase in fuel prices, 
the higher level of activity, operating costs associated with the growth of the airline and the strength 
of sterling to the euro.   Fuel, which represents 45% of total operating costs compared to 43% in the 
prior year, increased by 18% to EUR1,885.6m due to the higher price per gallon paid and increased activity 
in the period.  Unit costs excluding fuel increased by 3%, including fuel unit costs rose by 8%.  
Operating margin increased by 1 point to 15% whilst operating profit increased by 16% to EUR718.2m.
 Net margin remained flat at 12%, compared to March 31, 2012.
 Basic earnings per share for the period were 39.45 euro cent compared to basic earnings per share of 
34.10 euro cent at March 31, 2012.
 Balance sheet
 Gross cash increased by EUR43.4m since March 31, 2012 to EUR3,559.0m and Gross debt fell by EUR126.9m to 
EUR3,498.3m.  The Group generated cash from operating activities of EUR1,023.5m which funded net capital 
expenditure of EUR310.7m, a dividend of EUR491.5m, debt repayments, and a EUR67.5m share buy-back 
programme.  As a result the Group has moved to a net cash position of EUR60.7m at year end (March 31, 2012 
net debt EUR109.6m).
 Detailed Discussion and Analysis for the year ended March 31, 2013
 Profit after tax increased by 13% to EUR569.3m primarily due to a 6% increase in average fares and strong 
ancillary revenues offset by an 18% rise in fuel costs.  Total operating revenues increased by 13% to 
EUR4,884.0m primarily due to a 6% increase in average fares, a 5% rise in passenger numbers and strong 
ancillary revenue.  Fuel, which represents 45% of total operating costs, compared to 43% in the prior 
year, increased by 18% to EUR1,885.6m due to a higher price per gallon paid and increased activity in the 
period.  Unit costs excluding fuel rose by 3%, including fuel unit costs rose by 8%.  Operating margin, as 
a result of the above, increased by 1 point to 15% whilst operating profit increased by 16% to EUR718.2m.
 Total operating revenues increased by 13% to EUR4,884.0m primarily due to a 6% rise in average fares 
which was partially assisted by the strength of sterling to the euro, a 5% increase in passenger numbers 
to 79.3m and strong ancillary revenues.
 Total revenue per passenger rose by 8%, primarily due to a 6% increase in average fare and strong growth 
in ancillary revenues.
 Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 11% to EUR3,819.8m due to a 6% rise in average fares and a 5% 
increase in passenger numbers, and was partially assisted by the strength of sterling to the euro.  Load 
factor remained flat at 82%.
 Ancillary revenues increased by 20% to EUR1,064.2m, faster than the 5% increase in passenger numbers, due 
to a combination of an improved product mix, the roll out of reserved seating across the network, and 
higher internet related revenues.
 Total operating expenses increased by 12% to EUR4,165.8m due to the 18% rise in fuel costs, increased 
costs associated with the growth of the airline, and the negative impact of the strength of sterling to 
the euro.
 Staff costs increased by 5% to EUR435.6m due to a 4% increase in flight hours and a 2% pay increase for 
flight crew granted in April 2012.
 Depreciation and amortisation increased by 7% to EUR329.6m due to a combination of the increased level of 
activity and more 'owned' aircraft in the fleet this year (March 31, 2013: 246) compared to the prior year 
(March 31, 2012: 235).
 Fuel & oil costs increased by 18% to EUR1,885.6m due to higher fuel prices and the increased activity in 
the year.
 Maintenance costs increased by 16% to EUR120.7m, due to the higher level of activity, line maintenance 
costs arising from the launch of new bases and handback provisions for leased aircraft.

Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -77-
(e)           Equity risk
 The Company has exposure to equity price risk primarily in relation to its 29.8% investment in Aer 
Lingus. The Company does not have significant influence over Aer Lingus and accordingly, this investment 
is classified as an available-for-sale financial asset rather than an investment in an associate. 
Additional information in relation to the available-for-sale financial asset can be found in Note 4 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
 (f)            Credit risk
 The Company holds significant cash balances, which are invested on a short-term basis and are classified 
as either cash equivalents or liquid investments. These deposits and other financial instruments 
(principally certain derivatives and loans as identified above) give rise to credit risk on amounts due 
from counterparties. Credit risk is managed by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to 
any one counterparty through regular review of counterparties' market-based ratings, Tier 1 capital level 
and credit default swap rates and by taking into account bank counterparties' systemic importance to the 
financial systems of their home countries. The Company typically enters into deposits and derivative 
contracts with parties that have a long term Standard and Poors "A" category rating or equivalent credit 
rating. The maximum exposure arising in the event of default on the part of the counterparty is the 
carrying value of the relevant financial instrument. The Company is authorised to place funds on deposit 
for periods up to 18 months. The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital as well as the level of 
dividends to ordinary shareholders on an ongoing basis.
 The Company's revenues derive principally from airline travel on scheduled services, internet income and 
in-flight and related sales. Revenue is primarily derived from European routes. No individual customer 
accounts for a significant portion of total revenue.
 At March 31, 2013, EUR1.1 million (2012: EUR1.0 million; 2011: EUR0.7 million) of our total accounts 
receivable balance were past due, of which EUR0.1 million (2012: EUR0.1 million; 2011: EUR0.1 million) was 
impaired and provided for and EUR1.0 million (2012: EUR0.9 million; 2011: EUR0.6 million) was past due but 
not impaired. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
 (g)           Liquidity and capital management
 The Company's cash and liquid resources comprise cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and 
restricted cash. The Company defines the capital that it manages as the Company's long-term debt and 
equity. The Company's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and 
market confidence and to maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen 
events.
 The Company finances its working capital requirements through a combination of cash generated from 
operations and bank loans for the acquisition of aircraft. The Company had cash and liquid resources at 
March 31, 2013 of EUR3,559.0 million (2012: EUR3,515.6 million; 2011: EUR2,940.6 million). During the 
year, the Company funded EUR310.7 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment (2012: EUR317.6 
million;  2011: EUR897.2 million). Cash generated from operations has been the principal source for these 
cash requirements, supplemented primarily by aircraft-related financing structures.
 The Board of Directors periodically reviews the capital structure of the Company, considering the cost of 
capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. The Board approves any material adjustments 
to the capital structure in terms of the relative proportions of debt and equity.
 Ryanair has generally been able to generate sufficient funds from operations to meet its non-aircraft 
acquisition-related working capital requirements. Management believes that the working capital available 
to the Company is sufficient for its present requirements and will be sufficient to meet its anticipated 
requirements for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the 2014 fiscal year.
 (h)           Guarantees
 Details of the Company's guarantees and the related accounting have been disclosed in Note 23 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
 (i)            Sensitivity analysis
 (i)            Interest rate risk: Based on the levels of and composition of year-end interest bearing 
assets and liabilities, including derivatives, at March 31, 2013, a plus or minus one-percentage-point 
movement in interest rates would result in a respective increase or decrease of EUR18.3 million (net of 
tax) in net interest income and expense in the income statement (2012: EUR18.3 million; 2011: EUR10.9 
million) and EUR28.8 million in equity. All of the Group's interest rate swaps are used to swap variable 
rate debt to fixed rate debt; consequently any changes in interest rates would have an equal and opposite 
income statement effect for both the interest rate swaps and the debt.
 (ii)           Foreign currency risk: A plus or minus change of 10% in relevant foreign currency exchange 
rates, based on outstanding foreign currency-denominated financial assets and financial liabilities at 
March 31, 2013 would have a respective positive or negative impact on the income statement of EUR2.6 
million (net of tax) (2012: EUR1.8 million; 2011: EUR3.7  million) and on equity of EUR183.1 million (net 
of tax) (2012: EUR176.3 million; 2011: EUR201.1 million).
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -77-
 (iii)          Equity price risk: An increase/decrease of 10% in the Aer Lingus share price as of March 
31, 2013 would result in an increase/decrease of EUR22.1 million in the fair value of the available-for-
sale financial assets (2012: EUR15.0 million; 2011: EUR11.4 million). The increase/decrease would be 
recognised in other comprehensive income.

 RYANAIR CRITICISES AER LINGUS - VIRGIN LEASE DEAL
 BELIEVES IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF AER LINGUS' COMMERCIAL FAILURE
 Ryanair, Ireland's favourite airline, today (10 Dec) criticised the Board and Management of Aer Lingus 
for their latest "wet lease" agreement with Virgin Atlantic, which Ryanair believes is yet another example 
of Aer Lingus' commercial failure and lack of any independent future.
 Ryanair highlighted that this is Aer Lingus' second attempt at such a wet lease type arrangement, 
following the transatlantic "partnership" with United Airlines, which started in March 2010, under which 
Aer Lingus switched one of its transatlantic aircraft, to operate an effective wet lease for United on the 
Washington - Madrid route.  In July 2011, Aer Lingus' CEO Christoph Mueller claimed "We operate the 
aircraft very cost efficiently and United is selling it at very reasonable yields and it works...".  Mr 
Mueller "believes this type of operation could be strategically important for the future".  Yet this 
"strategically important" partnership was ended by United in October 2012 after just 30 months.
 Ryanair called on the Board and Management of Aer Lingus to explain why Aer Lingus is wet leasing 4 of 
its larger A320 aircraft to Virgin to operate routes to/from Heathrow which have no connection with or 
value to Ireland.  Where will these 4 aircraft come from?  Will they be taken from Aer Lingus' existing 
bases at Shannon, Cork or Dublin?  Will this result in yet another decline in Aer Lingus' traffic, which 
has already fallen from 10.4m in 2009 to 9.5m in 2011?  Will Aer Lingus' contribution to Ireland's 
"Grabbing" in 2013 be yet another 1m cut in capacity and traffic to/from the Republic of Ireland?
 Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said:
 "In 2010 Aer Lingus was promising that the United Airlines wet lease "partnership" would be the way 
forward, yet 2 years later United abruptly cancelled the deal and returned the aircraft to Aer Lingus.  
Instead, United have now entered the Washington-Dublin route, which Aer Lingus previously withdrew from.
 Today's announcement that Aer Lingus is to take 4 of its existing aircraft away from Ireland, thereby 
reducing its Irish traffic by up to 1 million passengers annually, so that it can rent these aircraft to 
Virgin Atlantic on a short-term wet lease arrangement seems to be yet another admission that Aer Lingus 
has no commercial strategy or independent future.  What happens in a year or two years time if Virgin 
Atlantic wants to cancel the deal and Aer Lingus is left with 4 aircraft with nothing to do, but has 1 
million fewer core passengers ?
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR CRITICISES AER LINGUS - VIRGIN LEASE DEAL
 If, as Aer Lingus claims, their brand and commercial strategy is working, then why are they spray 
painting 4 aircraft in Virgin colours and renting them out, rather than running more routes to/from 
Ireland for the "Grabbing" in 2013?  Ryanair believes that this latest wet lease deal with Virgin is yet 
another sign that Aer Lingus has no viable commercial strategy, a mismanaged and fading brand and no 
independent future."

adjustments in 2005 are items that do not reflect the underlying business performance. As IAS 39 and IFRS 4 have 
been implemented with effect from 1 January 2005, the adjustments in 2004 reflect the impact that these standards 
would have had on the effective interest rate and insurance business had they been applied from 1 January 2004.

10 July 2007
                RYANAIR RESPONDS TO EU COMMISSION INVESTIGATION
               INTO BERLIN, DORTMUND, LUBECK AND TAMPERE AIRPORTS
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Tuesday, 10th July 2007)
condemned the European Commission ,which announced investigations into Easyjet's
cost base at Berlin and Dortmund airports, and Ryanair's costs base at Lubeck
and Tampere airports, while at the same time continuing to ignore the blatant
State Aid being doled out to Europe's largest flag carriers including Air
France, Alitalia, Lufthansa and Olympic.
Ryanair pointed to the European Commission's repeated failure to investigate
massive State Aid as follows:
 1. Air France enjoys a 50% discount on airport charges for domestic routes at
      French airports which amounts to unlawful State Aid of over EUR1bn over the
      last 7 years.
 2. Lufthansa's exclusive use of the second terminal at Munich Airport which
      caused the State owned Munich Airport to lose over EUR50m last year. These
      enormous losses being made by the State owned airport for the sole and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Response to EU Investigation
      exclusive benefit of Lufthansa prove conclusively that Lufthansa is not
      paying the full charges associated with the second terminal at Munich.
 3. The European Commission has repeatedly ignored the billions of euro of State
      aid which are handed annually to Alitalia in the form of rescue and recovery
     plans.
 4. The European Commission continues to ignore the annual bail out of the loss
      making Olympic Airlines by the Greek Government.
Commenting today Ryanair's Spokesman, Peter Sherrard said:
    "Today's announcement proves that the European Commission has a biased
     approach to State Aid investigations. It continues to ignore EURbillions of
     State Aid to flag carrier airlines in the form of discounted domestic
     charges, exclusive use of terminal facilities and annual bail outs to
     Alitalia and Olympic Airlines, yet at the same time the Commission is
     wasting time and resources investigating the cost base of small secondary
     airports such as Lubeck and Tampere, which without Ryanair would have no
     traffic at all, or the main airports of secondary cities such as Berlin and
     Dortmund, which would have far smaller traffic numbers were it not for the
     services provided by Easyjet.
    "This latest development is further proof that this European Commission has
     given up on deregulating the European Air Travel market, and is intent on
     re-regulating that market at every hands turn. At a time when many of
     Europe's flag carrier airlines are raising fares and levying fuel
     surcharges, Ryanair calls on the Commission to launch investigations of
     these massive State Aid subventions to Air France, Lufthansa, Alitalia and
     Olympic Airlines, instead of wasting time investigating the affairs of
     smaller secondary regional airports who are and should be free to continue
     to discount their charges in order to win new business from low fare
     airlines.
    "What's next from this European Commission? Perhaps they will investigate
     McDonalds for negotiating discounts with beef and cheese suppliers? Perhaps
     they will investigate Ikea for negotiating volume discounts with furniture
     suppliers? Who knows perhaps they will investigate Tesco for using its
     purchasing power to negotiate supplier discounts on behalf of its customers.
    "Low fares airlines negotiate substantial discounts over the high published
     charges at many airports in secondary cities and secondary airports,
     precisely because those airports wish to develop new routes, traffic and
     business. This development has created competition to the high fare flag
     carrier airlines who are using their political power and influence to send
     the European Commission off on wild goose chases, whilst ignoring the real
     State Aid scandals which are the massive subventions which continue to be
     given annually to flag carrier airlines like Air France, Lufthansa, Alitalia
     and Olympic.
    "This Commission is not interested in competition, it simply wants to
     protect the flag carrier airlines and penalise the low fares airlines who
     are negotiating discounts at secondary airports and passing on those
     discounts to the travelling public in the form of lower fares.
    "It is noteworthy that this latest investigation comes just two weeks after
     the EU Commission blocked Ryanair's takeover of Aer Lingus, when it had
     previously rubber stamped the much larger Air France takeover of KLM and the
     Lufthansa takeover of Swiss and Austrian. Clearly this Commission applies
     one rule to the flag carrier airlines and an entirely different rule to the
     low fares airlines. Sadly this Commission cannot be trusted to advance the
     cause of consumers, it is more interested in protecting the narrow self
     interest of flag carrier airlines".

    RYANAIR APPEALS COMMISSION'S UNLAWFUL AND POLITICALLY MOTIVATED DECISION
                          PROHIBITING AER LINGUS MERGER
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Monday, 10th September 2007)
confirmed that it has submitted its appeal to the European Court of First
Instance (CFI) in Luxembourg against the EU Commission's unlawful and
politically motivated decision to prohibit its merger with Aer Lingus. Ryanair
had made an offer of EUR2.80 per share to acquire Aer Lingus following the former
national airline's floatation last October. Ryanair was required to seek
approval for clearance of the deal from the European Commission. However,
following an 8-month investigation, the Commission blocked the merger following
pressure from the Irish Government and Aer Lingus. As a result, Aer Lingus
shareholders have suffered a 58% collapse in their interim profits, and a share
price fall to EUR2.50.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Appeals EC decision
The merger between Ryanair and Aer Lingus would have:
 1. Immediately reduced Aer Lingus fares and eliminated Aer Lingus' unfair fuel
     surcharges, saving consumers over EUR100m. p.a.;
  2. Retained Aer Lingus as a separate brand and continued to operate the two
     airlines separately, thus giving passengers a choice of services;
  3. Retained all of Aer Lingus' profitable routes, including Shannon-Heathrow,
     which Aer Lingus subsequently abandoned;
  4. Reduced Aer Lingus' costs and improved its efficiency; and
  5. Improved Aer Lingus' service and punctuality.
Ryanair is confident that the CFI will overturn this decision because:
 1. This is the first airline merger that was actively opposed by a national
     Government (on narrow political grounds). The Irish Government has now
     admitted that they retained their "strategic" shareholding in Aer Lingus to
     block a hostile takeover "like Ryanair's bid".
  2. This is the first time that the Commission has prohibited a merger between
     two companies which combined will have less than 5% of the EU market.
  3. This is the first time that the Commission has prohibited an airline merger
     and reverses a 20-year policy of encouraging EU airline mergers, having
     previously approved the larger Air France/KLM and Lufthansa/Austrian/Swiss
     mergers.
  4. This is the first time that an EU airline merger offered guaranteed fare
     reductions (and fuel surcharge elimination) of over EUR100m. p.a. for the
     benefit of European consumers.
  5. This prohibition leaves Aer Lingus exposed as a small, peripheral regional
     airline, which cannot compete with Ryanair on price or punctuality from
     Dublin (it has recently pulled off another 5 Ryanair routes from Dublin and
     also announced the closure of its Shannon-Heathrow route) at a time when the
     rest of the European industry is consolidating. Aer Lingus' recent interim
     results saw a 58% decline in Aer Lingus' profits, despite an average short
     haul fare of over EUR90 (more than double Ryanair's average fare of EUR41).
Speaking today in Dublin, Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan,
said:
        "We have filed our appeal with the CFI today asking them to overturn the
         Commission's unlawful and politically motivated decision to block
         Ryanair's merger with Aer Lingus. This merger, which accounts for less
         than 5% of the EU air transport market, was clearly pro-competition and
         would have been the first merger in history to guarantee fare
         reductions, which would have saved European consumers more then EUR100m.
         p.a. The Commission made several manifest errors in its assessment of
         the merger and ignored evidence from Ryanair demonstrating the numerous
         benefits that the merger would bring to consumers and increased
         competition with the high fares Mega Carriers. At the same time, the
         Commission accepted, without question, misleading and factually
         inaccurate submissions from the Irish Government and Aer Lingus, both of
         whom were clearly trying to block the merger.
        "Ryanair also offered unprecedented commitments to the Commission to
         address any possible competition concerns, including giving up more than
         half of Aer Lingus' Dublin-Heathrow slots, as well as over 1,700
         additional weekly slots - several times what has been offered in any
         previous airline merger. However, the Commission refused these
         commitments, preferring instead to block this pro-consumer,
         pro-competition merger for narrow political reasons.
        "The Commission's prohibition of the merger has denied European
         consumers of these benefits and further protects the growing Mega
         Carriers like BA/Iberia/oneworld; Air France/KLM/Skyteam; and Lufthansa/
         SAS/bmi/Star Alliance from a stronger, more competitive Ryanair/Aer
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Appeals EC decision
         Lingus group. It has also seen Aer Lingus shareholders lose over EUR150m.
         as the share price has fallen to EUR2.50, considerably lower than
         Ryanair's offer last October.
        "We are confident that the CFI will overturn this decision in the
         interests of consumers and the competitiveness of the industry. As
         always with the European Commission, there seems to be one rule for the
         national Mega Carriers and a completely different one for Ryanair".

 In April 2009, Ryanair signed a contract with Webloyalty International Ltd, which offers Ryanair's customers who 
have a UK, German or French billing address a retail discount and cash-back program. In February 2009, Ryanair 
introduced Google Adsense to its search results pages in order to monetize the traffic levels that those pages 
generate. In March 2009, Ryanair expanded further into the area of third-party Internet advertising with the 
introduction of third-party display advertising on the homepages on its website and, more recently, on the subpages 
of Ryanair.com. In April 2011, Ryanair began to sell advertising on its boarding cards. In 2012, a boarding card 
redesign along with increased passengers is expected to provide further growth in this area.
 Ryanair has entered into agreements pursuant to which the Company promotes Ryanair-branded credit and 
prepaid cards issued by MBNA, GE Money, Access Prepaid (a Mastercard company) and Banco Santander on its 
Internet site. The MBNA agreement relates to Irish residents only, the GE Money agreement relates to Swedish and 
Polish residents only and the Banco Santander agreement relates to UK residents only. Ryanair generates revenue 
from MBNA, GE Capital and Banco Santander on the basis of the number of cards issued and the revenues 
generated through the use of the credit cards. The Access Prepaid Limited prepaid card covers residents in the UK, 
Ireland, Italy, Spain and Germany.
 In fiscal year 2012, Ryanair rolled out handheld Electronic Point of Sale ("EPOS") devices across its route network. 
These EPOS devices replaced manual and paper based systems on board the aircraft. The EPOS device enables 
cabin crew to sell and record their on-board sales transactions more efficiently and generate vastly improved 
management sales reporting. The EPOS device also issues bus and rail tickets and tickets for tourist attractions.
 In fiscal year 2011, Ryanair began offering reserved seating in twenty-one extra legroom seats on each aircraft for 
a fee on certain routes and this feature was rolled out to all routes in fiscal year 2012.
 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS
 General
 As part of its commitment to safety, Ryanair endeavors to hire qualified maintenance personnel, provide proper 
training to such personnel, and maintain its aircraft in accordance with European industry standards. While Ryanair 
seeks to maintain its fleet in a cost-effective manner, management does not seek to extend Ryanair's low-cost 
operating strategy to the areas of maintenance, training or quality control.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -27-
 Ryanair's quality assurance department deals with oversight of all maintenance activities in accordance with Part 
145. The European Aviation Safety Agency ("EASA"), which established Part 145, came into being on September 
28, 2003, through the adoption of Regulation (EC) No. 1592/2002 of the European Parliament, and its standards 
superseded 
the 
previous 
Joint 
Aviation 
Authority 
("JAA") 
requirements. 
See 
"[3/4]Government 
Regulation[3/4]Regulatory Authorities."
 Ryanair is itself an EASA Part 145-approved maintenance contractor and provides its own routine aircraft 
maintenance and repair services. Ryanair also performs certain checks on its aircraft, including pre-flight, daily, and 
transit checks at some of its bases, as well as A-checks at its Dublin, London (Stansted), Glasgow (Prestwick), 
Bremen and Frankfurt (Hahn) facilities. Since December 2003, Ryanair has operated a five-bay hangar facility at its 
base at Glasgow (Prestwick) in Scotland, where both A-checks and C-checks are performed on the fleet of Boeing 
737-800 aircraft. The facility performs up to four C-checks per week, enabling Ryanair to perform all of the heavy 
maintenance that is currently required on its Boeing 737-800 fleet in-house.
 Ryanair opened a five-bay hangar and stores facility at its London (Stansted) airport base in October 2008 to allow 
Ryanair to carry out additional line maintenance on its expanding fleet. This facility also incorporates two flight 
simulator devices with space and provisions for two more, together with a cabin crew trainer and associated training 
rooms. Ryanair has completed the building of a separate training facility adjacent to the hangar to accommodate a 
full size 737NG training aircraft to allow for cabin crew and engineering training. Ryanair carries out checks and line 
maintenance in its single-bay aircraft hangar facility in Bremen. Ryanair has also entered into a 30-year sole-
tenancy agreement with Frankfurt (Hahn) airport and has taken acceptance of a two-bay hangar and stores facility 
that also incorporates a two-bay simulator-training center. This facility was completed in January 2011 and allows 
Ryanair to carry out additional line maintenance including A checks.
 Maintenance and repair services that may become necessary while an aircraft is located at some of the other 
airports served by Ryanair are provided by other Part 145-approved contract maintenance providers. Aircraft return 
each evening to Ryanair's bases, where they are examined by Ryanair's approved engineers or, in the case of 
Brussels (Charleroi), Stockholm (Skavsta), Frankfurt (Hahn), Barcelona (Girona), Madrid, Alicante, Dusseldorf 
(Weeze), Bristol, Paphos and Billund, by local Part 145-approved companies.
 Heavy Maintenance
 As noted above, Ryanair currently has sufficient capacity to be able to carry out all of the routine maintenance work 
required on its Boeing 737-800 fleet itself. Ryanair opened a new three-bay maintenance hangar at Glasgow 
(Prestwick) airport in winter 2010 to accommodate the additional maintenance requirements arising from its 
expanding and aging fleet.
 Ryanair contracts out engine overhaul service for its Boeing 737-800 aircraft to General Electric Engine Services 
pursuant to a 10-year agreement with an option for a 10-year extension, signed in 2004. This comprehensive 
maintenance contract provides for the repair and overhaul of the CFM56-7B series engines fitted to the first 155 of 
Ryanair's Boeing 737-800 aircraft, the repair of parts and general technical support for the fleet of engines. On June 
30, 2008, the Company finalized a contract for a similar level of coverage and support for the engines on all of its 
aircraft that have been or are scheduled to be delivered pursuant to the Company's current contracts with Boeing 
over the period through November 2012. Due to the fact that engines on recently delivered aircraft will not require a 
scheduled engine overhaul prior to the expiry of the current contract with GE, Ryanair has decided, at this time, not 
to take up its option to have engines delivered with aircraft after October 2010 covered by this contract. General 
Electric Engine Services mainly uses its Part 145-approved repair facility in Cardiff, Wales for this work, but also 
uses the KLM Part 145-approved facility in Amsterdam, and occasionally its Part 145-approved facility in Celma, 
Brazil. By contracting with experienced Part 145-approved maintenance providers, management believes it is better 
able to ensure the quality of its aircraft and engine maintenance. Ryanair assigns a Part 145-certified mechanic to 
oversee all heavy maintenance and to authorize all engine overhauls performed by third parties. Maintenance 
providers are also monitored closely by the national authorities under EASA and national regulations.
 Ryanair expects to be dependent on external service contractors, particularly for engine and component 
maintenance, for the foreseeable future, notwithstanding the additional capabilities provided by its maintenance 
facilities at Glasgow (Prestwick), London (Stansted) and Frankfurt (Hahn). See "Item 3. Key Information-Risk 
Factors-Risks Related to the Company-The Company Is Dependent on External Service Providers."
 SAFETY RECORD
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 -27-
 Ryanair has not had a single passenger or flight crew fatality in its 27-year operating history. Ryanair demonstrates 
its commitment to safe operations through its safety training procedures, its investment in safety-related equipment, 
and its adoption of an internal confidential reporting system for safety issues. The Company's Board of Directors 
also has an air safety committee to review and discuss air safety and related issues. Michael Horgan, a Company 
director, is the chairman of this committee and reports to the Board of Directors.
 Ryanair's flight training is oriented towards accident prevention and covers all aspects of flight operations. Ryanair 
maintains full control of the content and delivery of all of its flight crew training, including initial, recurrent, and 
upgrade phases. All training programs are approved by the Irish Aviation Authority (the "IAA"), which regularly 
audits both operation control standards and flight crew training standards for compliance with EU legislation.
 All of the Boeing 737-800s that Ryanair has bought or committed to buy are certified for Category IIIA landings 
(automatic landings with minimum horizontal visibility of 200 meters and a 50 feet decision height).
 Ryanair has a comprehensive and documented safety management system. Management encourages flight crews 
to report any safety-related issues through the Safety Alert Initial Report reporting program or to use the confidential 
reporting system, which is available online through Ryanair's Crewdock system. The confidential reporting system 
affords flight crews the opportunity to report directly to Flight Safety Officer any event, error, or discrepancy in flight 
operations that they do not wish to report through standard reporting channels. The confidential reporting system is 
designed to increase management's awareness of problems that may be encountered by flight crews in their day-
to-day operations. Management uses the information reported through all reporting systems to modify operating 
procedures and improve flight operation standards.

 or disposal) that CGC is reporting this aggregated holding.

have been restated by GBP20m in respect of the change in the revenue accounting
policy in the fourth quarter of 2003/04 on adoption of Financial Reporting
Standard 5 Application Note G.
2. BAA and Ryanair have issued counter writs in respect of the non payment of
airport charges and claims that the fuel levy charged by BAA to the fuel
companies is excessive and unlawful respectively. As a result of the non
payment of airport charges, BAA considers that Ryanair has repudiated its
existing agreements. This has resulted in Ryanair being invoiced an additional
GBP14m of airport charges since July. Ryanair has refused to pay these additional
charges. Although BAA is confident of winning the dispute, given the current
litigation a GBP14m provision at 31December 2004 has been established.

5. The interest charge is shown net of capitalised interest in respect of the
Group of GBP55m (31 December 2003: GBP62m; 31 March 2004: GBP85m), including GBP58m (31
December 2003: GBP43m; 31 March 2004 GBP62m) in respect of Terminal 5, of which GBP5m

income is GBP8m (31December 2003: GBP1m; 31 March 2004: GBP1m).
6. The taxation charge for the nine months ended 31 December 2004 has been
based on the estimated effective rate for the full year before exceptional

7. The Group's investment properties are included at 31 March 2004 valuations
as adjusted for additions and disposals since that date.
8. Airport fixed assets in the course of construction (excluding capitalised
interest and unwinding of the discount rate on the purchase of the Terminal 5
Thames Water land) include GBP2,174m (31 December 2003: GBP1,410m; 31 March 2004: GBP
1,589m) in respect of Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport. This includes GBP181m (31
December 2003: GBP191m, 31 March 2004: GBP189m) for the acquisition of land for the
construction of Terminal 5. The operational assets employed by the vendor of
this land have been relocated and the acquisition cost represents the present
value of the estimated deferred payments to be made over 35 years to the vendor
in compensation for relocation.
Airport fixed assets in the course of construction also include GBP26m in respect
of costs, incurred in connection with the initial planning application
preparation (GBP9m) and purchase of domestic properties that fall within the
expanded airport boundary (GBP17m), required for the development of a second
runway and related facilities at Stansted.

11. Holders of US$109m of Loan Notes of World Duty Free Americas, Inc. (now
known as DFA Inc.), sold by BAA in October 2001, issued proceedings against BAA
plc, World Duty Free plc and the purchaser of WDFA Inc. in May 2002, for $109m
and punitive damages, claiming the defendants had fraudulently conveyed the
assets of WDFA Inc. A trial in December 2003 found BAA plc and World Duty Free
plc not liable to the bond holders on all counts. An appeal by the bond holders
was held in November 2004 and a decision is expected in early 2005. BAA is
confident that it will be successful in opposing the appeal or, again,
succeeding in the unlikely event of a further trial being ordered.

 RYANAIR WELCOMES COMPETITION COMMISSION'S DECISION TO BREAK UP THE BAA AIRPORT 
MONOPOLY
 While BAA delays the sale of Stansted, costs keep rising, while traffic keeps falling
 Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, welcomed this morning's (19(th) July) latest confirmation by the UK 
Competition Commission that the BAA airport monopoly should be forced to sell Stansted and at least one Scottish 
airport. Ryanair hopes that this latest confirmation of the CC's original (August 2008) decision will finally end the 
BAA monopoly's policy of using its legal stratagems to delay this sale, while it continues to overcharge airlines at 
Stansted to generate excess monopoly profits, while losing more routes and traffic. Ryanair calls on the UK 
Government to intervene and force the early sale of Stansted and one of the Scottish airports to allow competition 
between airports to deliver a better deal for airport users, where the BAA monopoly has repeatedly failed.
 Ryanair condemned the BAA's continuing mismanagement of, and monopoly abuses at, Stansted Airport. Over the 
past five years the BAA has doubled its charges to airlines at Stansted, and is now generating excess profits. 
During that five year period, traffic at Stansted has collapsed from over 24m in 2007 to just over 18m in 2011. 
Already this year, Ryanair, easyJet, Air Berlin, Thomas Cook, Thompson, Star1 and Air Asia have announced 
further cuts in flights and traffic at Stansted in the face of continuing high costs and monopoly profiteering by BAA 
Stansted.
 Ryanair has instructed its lawyers to examine the regulatory accounts of BAA Stansted which show excess 
charges and monopoly profiteering by the BAA at Stansted. Sadly the incompetent regulator (the CAA) allows these 
monopoly profits to be understated through cost transfers and Head Office charges applied by the BAA monopoly. 
Ryanair believes that the BAA is abusing its monopoly power at Stansted to gouge airlines and passengers in order 
to fund Ferrovial's ownership and development of Heathrow Airport. Ryanair intends to shortly launch legal 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Welcomes Competition Commission's Decision
proceedings against BAA Stansted, seeking a recovery of the overcharges which Ryanair believes it and other 
Stansted airlines have suffered at the BAA monopoly's hands in recent years.
 Welcoming today's ruling by the Competition Commission, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "Back in August 2008, the Competition Commission recommended the break up of the BAA airport monopoly. The 
Competition Commission found that "the BAA's monopoly ownership of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports 
had adversely affected competition". It also found that "the way the BAA has conducted its business has adversely 
affected competition". It also concluded that "the inadequate regulatory regime operated by the CAA has adversely 
affected competition".
 "It is regrettable that today, some three years later, the BAA has still failed to comply with the Competition 
Commission's 2008 ruling to sell Stansted and one of the Scottish airports. Ryanair believes that the BAA is an 
abusive airport monopoly, which engages in significant overcharging and monopoly profiteering at Stansted, to fund 
Ferrovial's acquisition and operation of Heathrow Airport. BAA Stansted's regulatory accounts show enormous 
intergroup and Head Office charges being paid by Stansted Airport in order to understate the monopoly profits 
being exploited by the BAA monopoly at Stansted.
 "Ryanair believes that the airlines and our passengers have been significantly overcharged by the BAA Stansted 
monopoly in recent years and while the incompetent regulator, the CAA, continues to sit on its hands and do 
nothing to protect users. The Competition Commission has conclusively demonstrated that CAA airport regulation 
has failed in the UK and competition is the way forward. We regret that the BAA continues to use every legal tactic 
in the book to delay this process for over three years now, and have no doubt that they will continue to use their 
expensive lawyers to frustrate and delay the sale of Stansted. The BAA airport monopoly continues to damage 
competition, and the CAA's inadequate regulatory regime has allowed them to get away with it. It is now time for the 
Government to intervene in this shambles and force the early sale of Stansted and one of the Scottish airports and 
allow competition to provide consumers with more choice, lower costs and a better experience between the London 
airports."
 Ends.

 STOBART GROUP LIMITED
 ('Stobart Group' or 'the Group')
 Pre-Close Trading Statement
 Stobart Group Limited, the Aviation, Energy and Rail & Civils business, has today issued the following 
pre-close trading statement before the announcement of its interim results for the six months to 31 August 
2018. This announcement will be made on 24 October 2018.
 Highlights
 --     Aviation: Passenger numbers at London Southend Airport up by 37%; Ryanair flights starting in 
Spring 2019 and the easyJet partnership will drive further growth, with an additional aircraft added this 
summer
 --     Energy: Growth of processed tonnages sold up circa 50%
 --     GBP27.5 million net cash realised in sales from non-operating assets
 --     Interim dividend of 4.5p per share declared. This will be paid on 5 October 2018 to shareholders 
on the register as at 14 September 2018
 Stobart Group has continued to commercialise its core operating businesses, delivering operational 
progress in Aviation and Energy.
 At London Southend Airport, the Group has focused on improving awareness through branding and marketing, 
route development, and airline incentive deals to accelerate its growth. During the financial year, we 
accelerated the previously announced GBP30m to GBP40m investment plan, principally in relation to the 
franchised airline business, to enhance the value of the airport through an increase in sustainable and 
profitable passenger numbers. The introduction of Ryanair flights in Spring 2019 is the next step in the 
growth of our London airport. This significant long-term partnership agreement is expected to result in at 
least one million additional passengers in the first year and more than five million in the first five 
years.  A new agreement with The Restaurant Group to introduce six new food and beverage brands to the 
airport will help maximise the commercial value of these passengers.
Stobart Group Limited Pre-Close Trading Statement
 The agreement with Ryanair gives us further confidence that we will deliver on our aim to welcome five 
million passengers a year to the airport by 2022. The investment in the franchised operations from London 
Southend Airport has contributed successfully to the attraction of other airlines to the airport. The 
results of the Aviation division for the full year, excluding the investment in the franchise operations, 
are expected to be broadly in line with expectations.
 Stobart Energy has significantly increased underlying EBITDA and tonnes supplied compared to the prior 
year despite continued delays in the commissioning of third-party energy plants. These delays have put 
pressure on the supply chain for the second year running and exaggerated the impact of non-underlying 
costs. Therefore, the results for the Energy division will be slightly below expectations in the short 
term.  However, the investment in "best in class" infrastructure, including cutting-edge IT systems, means 
that Stobart Energy is well positioned to deliver strong profitability per tonne when energy plants are 
operating to target.
 Stobart Rail & Civils secured framework contracts with Network Rail, Transport for Greater Manchester, 
and is an Alliance member for the TransPennine route upgrade. The business also renewed its partnership 
with the Environment Agency to deliver Emergency Response. Other contract wins include the Newton Heath 
and Inverness maintenance facilities contracts with Northern and Scot Rail, providing previously untapped 
revenue streams. The business has reviewed its revenue recognition on long-term contracts and adopted a 
more prudent approach. This means the results for the year are likely to be lower than expectations.
 The Group has moved quickly to action the proposals set out by the Board in July designed to unify the 
interests of shareholders. It appointed a leading independent search firm Russell Reynolds as part of a 
thorough and rigorous process to refresh and further strengthen the Board. In August, the Board announced 
the appointment of Nick Dilworth as Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer, Ginny Pulbrook as Non-
Executive Director and Michael Williamson as Interim CFO.
 Warwick Brady, CEO, Stobart Group commented:
 "We are reviewing all aspects of the Group to ensure we are well placed to deliver the ambitious growth 
targets set by the Board to double the value of the business. We are confident that we can meet our 
commitment to shareholders to unify the business and provide the framework for the delivery of the 
Company's strategy to the benefit of all stakeholders."
 The person responsible for arranging the release of this announcement on behalf of Stobart Group is 
Louise Brace, Company Secretary.

Body
It is extraordinary for the Aer Lingus board to claim that Ryanair's Offer
"significantly undervalues" Aer Lingus when Ryanair's EUR2.80 offer per share
represents a 27% premium to the EUR2.20 per share valuation which the board of Aer
Lingus agreed just 8 days previously.
Minister Cullen's statement 6th October 2006
Taking just a few of the points made by Minister Cullen in his statement,
Ryanair responds as
follows:
        (a) "...I do not consider that the Government's and Ireland's strategic
         objectives would be well served by a takeover of Aer Lingus by
         Ryanair."
        Ryanair believes that its proposal represents Aer Lingus' best
         opportunity to remain an Irish headquartered, managed, controlled and
         regulated airline, fully focused on Irish strategic objectives.
         Ryanair's Offer clearly meets the Government's strategy by securing the
         future of Aer Lingus, retaining the Heathrow slots and Aer Lingus'
         branding. Ryanair's Offer - if accepted - will establish one strong
         Irish airline group (as there is in the UK (BA), Germany (Lufthansa) and
         France (Air France)) which clearly meets Ireland's strategic objectives.
(b)     "The IPO means that Aer Lingus is better positioned than ever in the
         past, to grow and develop its business and to minimise the opportunities
         for competitors."
Ryanair Holdings PLC Key Elements of Offer Doc -2-
        If Ryanair's Offer fails, Aer Lingus will continue to be under the de
         facto control of the Government and unions. Given this Government's
         track record on aviation and transport issues generally (ranging from
         the state monopolies of Dublin Airport Authority, Dublin Bus, and CIE
         and all points between) this will mean that the dead hand of
         anti-competitive, monopolistic and anti-consumer policies continues to
         drag down Aer Lingus. Ryanair finds it unusual that the Minister now
         confirms that the rationale for the IPO of Aer Lingus was to "minimise
         the opportunities for competitors".
(c)    "Delivering a single airline group as Ryanair suggests will not deliver
        the benefits to the Irish consumer that Ryanair has suggested."
        This claim is without foundation given that Ryanair's Offer, if
         successful, commits it to reducing Aer Lingus' fares by 21/2% per year
         for a minimum period of 4 years and reducing the fuel surcharge, both of
         which are clearly of benefit to, and have the support of, consumers.
(d)    "consumer interests are best served by having a variety of product
         offerings that meet the requirements of different segments of the market
         and our policy in respect of airlines and airports has been developed to
         deliver this and to facilitate flexibility and choice for the consumer."
        Ryanair's Offer for Aer Lingus guarantees that Aer Lingus and Ryanair
         will continue to be run and managed separately, serving different market
         segments, with different product offerings. The combination of Ryanair
         and Aer Lingus will still find it difficult to advance consumer
         interests when dealing with uncompetitive monopolies, such as the DAA,
         which are owned, protected and operated by the Minister for Transport.
         The DAA currently proposes to increase passenger charges by 60% at
         Dublin Airport.
 e.     "The Ryanair low-cost model has transformed the aviation experience for
         consumers and nowhere more than Ireland."
        For all of the reasons set out in this announcement and as our proven
         track record clearly demonstrates, Ryanair believes that our generous
         offer for Aer Lingus will ensure that Aer Lingus' customers will in
         future enjoy and benefit from our plan to lower fares and improve
         services in a stand alone, separately managed Aer Lingus.
Ryanair's Cash Offer delivers excellent value for Aer Lingus' Shareholders
whilst ensuring that the price on offer is one which will enable Ryanair to
continue to realise its objective of developing Aer Lingus, lowering fares and
advancing the best interests of Irish and European consumers.
Full details of the Cash Offer, including the terms and conditions under which
it is being made, will be posted to Aer Lingus shareholders on Monday next, 23rd
October 2006. The Cash Offer is conditional, amongst other things, upon
acceptances being received in respect of more than 50% of the Aer Lingus Shares
the subject of the Offer, including any Aer Lingus Shares beneficially owned or
controlled by Ryanair.
Full details for enquiries are printed at the end of this announcement:
                             THE RYANAIR CASH OFFER
Ryanair Holdings PLC Key Elements of Offer Doc -2-
Ryanair's generous cash offer
1. EUR2.80 is an excellent offer
    Ryanair's Offer of EUR2.80 in cash per Aer Lingus Share values Aer Lingus
     Group plc at approximately EUR1.481bn compared to its flotation value of
     EUR1.163bn just 8 days prior to Ryanair's Offer.
2. 27% premium in just 1 week
    The Offer represents a premium of approx 27% over the IPO price of Aer
     Lingus (EUR2.20) which was agreed as an appropriate value by the Government of
     Ireland, the Board of Aer Lingus, the ESOT and their respective advisers, on
     27 September - just 8 days prior to Ryanair's Offer.
3. Ryanair's bid is supporting an inflated share price
    If the Offer is not accepted, there is a likelihood that the share price of
     Aer Lingus will fall significantly. During the two days (Mon 2nd and Tue 3rd
     October) when Ryanair was not actively buying in the market, the Aer Lingus
     share price fell from EUR2.48 to EUR2.44, and from EUR2.44 to EUR2.41.
4. Government to realise over EUR500m
    If the Offer is accepted, the Irish Government will realise a total of over
     EUR500m from the sale of its stake in Aer Lingus, an enormous return from an
     airline which was, by its own admission, on the edge of bankruptcy just four
     years ago.
 5. Aer Lingus employees realise an average of over EUR60k each - tax free
     structure for ESOT
    If the Offer is accepted, Aer Lingus employees stand to realise over EUR220m,
     which equates to an average of over EUR60,000 per employee, and there is a
     mechanism which would allow ESOT Members to realise the proceeds of the
     shares held by the ESOT on a tax free basis.
6. Volatile earnings record of Aer Lingus
    Aer Lingus is an airline with a volatile earnings record which came close to
     bankruptcy four years ago, and whose cumulative losses (EUR616m) exceeded its
     cumulative profits (EUR433m) over the past 14 years by over EUR180m. Aer Lingus'
     earnings prospects will be enhanced by acceptance of the Ryanair Offer.
7. Ryanair's Offer will not lead to a monopoly
    Ryanair's Offer commits to maintaining Aer Lingus as a stand-alone separate
     airline. The two airlines will compete vigorously, therefore this will not
     lead to a monopoly. Aer Lingus' IPO document confirms that there is little
     crossover because Ryanair and Aer Lingus only compete on about 17 of more
     than 500 combined routes (Source: IPO Prospectus, p79).
    Whilst Ryanair and Aer Lingus together account for 61% of aircraft movements
     at Dublin Airport, this is not dissimilar to other large airline groupings
     at other European airports. For instance, SAS and its Lufthansa partners
     have over 85% of seats in Copenhagen, Austrian and its Lufthansa partners
     have over 70% of movements in Vienna, Olympic has over 73% of seats in
     Athens, TAP and its Star Alliance Partners have 60% of seats in Lisbon, Air
     France and its Sky Team Associates have 62% of movements in Charles de
     Gaulle, and Lufthansa and its Star Alliance Partners have 67% of movements
     in Munich.
    In addition, Dublin continues to be served by over 50 other scheduled
     airlines currently serving 112 international destinations, each of which is
     free to open new routes and increase services at Dublin should they so wish.
     Some of these airlines are significantly larger than the Ryanair/Aer Lingus
Ryanair Holdings PLC Key Elements of Offer Doc -2-
     combination would be (e.g. British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France/KLM).
     Moreover, these airlines can be joined by other airlines who wish to enter
     or grow the market as Ryanair continues to do.
8. Good for competition and good for consumers
During the 6 months to 30 June 2006, Aer Lingus' average short haul fare
increased by 2% to EUR86.49. This is in line with Aer Lingus' stated strategy to
"Maximise Passenger Revenues" (Source: IPO Prospectus, p71). Similarly, Aer
Lingus has recently refused to reduce its fuel surcharge despite recent falls in
oil prices (Source: Irish Independent, 4 October 2006). Rising fares and high
fuel surcharges are bad for competition and bad for consumers.
By contrast, Ryanair's Offer guarantees to reduce Aer Lingus' short haul fares
by 2.5% per year for a minimum period of 4 years and to reduce Aer Lingus' fuel
surcharges as oil prices fall. Lower fares and lower surcharges will be good for
consumers. Ryanair's Offer will therefore increase competition and lower prices
which is good for consumers and should stimulate growth.
             YOUR ALTERNATIVE (IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE CASH OFFER)
        AER LINGUS FACES AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE AS A SMALL REGIONAL AIRLINE
               IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET WITH A HIGH FARE STRUCTURE
                        AND AN UNCOMPETITIVE COST BASE.
         SUSTAINABILITY OF AER LINGUS PROFITABILITY IS UNCERTAIN
1. Aer Lingus' short haul fares are uncompetitive
    Aer Lingus' average short haul fare of EUR87.55 is hopelessly uncompetitive in
     the face of Ryanair's average equivalent of EUR41.23. As a result, Aer Lingus
     has seen its share of traffic between Ireland and the UK collapse in recent
     years as highlighted in the table below.
                             Aer Lingus' Share of Traffic Collapses

The strengthening of the euro to US$ also had a positive impact on both the
depreciation and amortisation charge.
Fuel costs rose by 46% to EUR186.2m due to a 21% increase in the number of hours
flown, a significant increase in the average US$ cost per gallon of fuel partly
offset by the positive impact of the strengthening of the Euro to the US$ during
the period.
Maintenance costs decreased by 12% to EUR27.2m reflecting an increase in the size
of the fleet operated, and an increase in the number of hours flown offset by
maintenance savings due to improved reliability arising from the higher
proportion of 737-800 operated. Four BAE 146 aircraft, which incurred higher
maintenance charges per aircraft operated compared to the remainder of the
fleet, were returned to KLM earlier this year. During the last quarter, six
leased 737-300 aircraft were returned earlier than scheduled, which in turn
enabled the company to release maintenance overhaul provisions of EUR5.2m.
Marketing and distribution costs increased by 22% to EUR13.4m due to higher spend
on promoting new routes and an increase in the level of activity during the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results -5-
period.
Aircraft rental costs increased by EUR17.2m to EUR23.6m reflecting the increased
costs associated with the lease of thirteen 737-800 aircraft since December
31,2003 offset by the return to KLM of four BAE 146 aircraft earlier this year.
Six leased 737-300 aircraft were also returned to the lessor during quarter the
3rd quarter.
Route charges increased by 26% to EUR101.3m due to an increase in the number of
sectors flown, an increase in the average sector length, an increase in the
weight of the aircraft operated, (which incur a higher charge), and the negative
impact of the strengthening of sterling against the Euro during the period.
Airport and handling charges increased by 22% to EUR134.6m, slightly more than the
increase in passenger volumes due to increased costs at certain existing
airports offset by lower costs at new airports, and the adverse impact of the
strength of the sterling exchange rate against the euro during the period.
Other expenses increased by 19% to EUR69.9m, which is less than the growth in
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some new and existing products,
and cost reductions achieved on indirect costs.
Operating margins have declined by 3% to 28% for the period reflecting the
substantial higher fuel prices increased and due to the reasons outlined above
operating profits increased by 8% to EUR284.2m.
Interest receivable has increased by 14% to EUR20.2m due to an increase in the
level of cash and liquid resources and an improvement in deposit interest rates
earned during the period compared to last year. Interest payable increased by
EUR5.7m due to the drawdown of debt to part fund the purchase of new aircraft
during the period.
The Company's Balance Sheet continues to strengthen due to the growth in profits
during the period. Capital expenditure amounted to EUR342.2m part funded by cash
generated from operating activities, whilst the excess cash of EUR190.5m is
reflected in the increase in cash and liquid resources to EUR1,447.9m at 31
December 2004. Long term Debt, net of repayments increased by EUR200.4m, which was
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results -5-
drawn down to part fund aircraft deliveries during the period.
Shareholders' Funds at December 31, 2004 have increased to EUR1,691.5m compared to
EUR1,455.3m at March 31, 2004.
                       Notes to the Financial Statements
 1. Accounting Policies
     The accounting policies followed in the preparation of these consolidated
     financial statements for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 are
     consistent with those set out in the financial statements for the year ended
     March 31, 2004.
  2. Approval of the Financial Statements
     The Audit Committee approved the consolidated financial statements for the
     Nine months ended December 31, 2004 on January 28th, 2005.
  3. Generally Accepted Accounting Policies
     The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results for the Quarter and Nine
     months ended December 31, 2004 are based on the results reported under Irish
     and UK GAAP.
  4. Aircraft retirement costs
        Six aircraft were retired earlier than projected in 2003 due to the
         detection of scratch marks ('scribing') that occurred during an aircraft
         painting programme on these aircraft in 1995. It had been determined
         that the cost of repairing these aircraft was uneconomic due to the
         short remaining life of the aircraft. Accordingly the Company had
         determined that the residual value of US$1m(EUR794k) for these aircraft
         was excessive and as a result reduced it to EUR250k per aircraft. The cost
         of this adjustment charge for five aircraft was reflected in the results
         for the quarter ended September 30,2003, and the charge for a sixth
         aircraft is expensed in quarter ended December 31, 2003.

11           Financial instruments and financial risk management
 The Company utilises financial instruments to reduce exposures to market risks throughout its business. 
Borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and liquid investments are used to finance the Company's operations. 
Derivative financial instruments are contractual agreements with a value that reflects price movements in 
an underlying asset. The Company uses derivative financial instruments, principally jet fuel derivatives, 
interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts to manage 
commodity risks, interest rate risks and currency exposures and to achieve the desired profile of fixed 
and variable rate borrowings and leases in appropriate currencies. It is the Company's policy that no 
speculative trading in financial instruments shall take place.
 The main risks attaching to the Company's financial instruments, the Company's strategy and approach to 
managing these risks, and the details of the derivatives employed to hedge against these risks have been 
disclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

 Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results for the 
remainder of the year are the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, 
costs associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, UK, European Union ("EU") 
and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and 
interest rates, airport access and charges, labour relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the 
general economic environment in Ireland, the UK, and Continental Europe, the general willingness of passengers to 
travel, other economic, social and political factors and flight interruptions caused by volcanic ash emissions or other 
atmospheric disruptions.
 Board of directors
 Details of the members of our Board of Directors are set forth on pages 114 and 115 of our 2015 annual report. Mr

our 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus (see note 8).
 Going concern
 After making enquiries and considering the Group's principal risks and uncertainties and its financial 
position and cash flows, the directors have formed a judgment, at the time of approving the interim 
financial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group as a whole 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least twelve months from 
the date of approval of the interim financial statements. For this reason, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the interim financial statements.
 Ryanair Holdings plc
 Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
 Interim Financial Statements
 1.            Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The unaudited condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the six months ended September 30, 2015 
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
 These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the interim financial statements"), 
which should be read in conjunction with our 2015 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2015, have 
been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as 
adopted by the EU ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full annual 
financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2015, are available at http://investor.ryanair.com/
 The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2015 do not constitute statutory financial 
statements of the Group within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2014. The consolidated financial 
statements of the Group for the year ended March 31, 2015, together with the independent auditor's report 
thereon, have been filed with the Irish Registrar of Companies following the Company's Annual General 
Meeting and are also available on the Company's Website.  The auditor's report on those financial 
statements was unqualified.
 The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the interim 
financial statements for the six month period ended September 30, 2015 on October 30, 2015.
 Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
 The following new and amended standards, that have been issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB), and are effective under those standards for the first time for the current financial year 
beginning on or after January 1, 2015, and have also been endorsed by the EU, have been applied by the 
Group for the first time in these condensed consolidated financial statements;
 --      Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions (Amendments to IAS 19) (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after July 1, 2014).*
 --      "Annual Improvements to IFRSs". 2010-2012 Cycle (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after July 1, 2014).*
 --      "Annual Improvements to IFRSs". 2011-2013 Cycle (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after July 1, 2014).
 * These standards or amendments to standards have been EU endorsed and have an effective date for periods 
beginning after February 1, 2015 or can be early adopted.
 The adoption of these new or amended standards did not have a material impact on our financial position 
or results from operations in the six month period ended September 30, 2015.
 Exceptional item The Group presents certain items separately, which are unusual, by virtue of their size 
and incidence, in the context of our ongoing core operations, as we believe this presentation represents 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -6-
the underlying business more accurately and reflects the manner in which investors typically analyse the 
results. Any amounts deemed exceptional for management discussion and analysis purposes have been 
classified for the purposes of the income statement in the same way as non-exceptional amounts of the same 
nature.
 The exceptional item in the half-year ended September 30, 2015 relates to a one-off gain on disposal of 
our 29.8% shareholding in Aer Lingus (see note 8).
 2.            Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements made by 
management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were 
the same as those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.            Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.            Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the half-year ended September 
30, 2015 was 12.2% (September 30, 2014: 12.4%).  The tax charge for the half-year ended September 30, 2015 
of EUR150.8M (September 30, 2014: EUR112.5M) comprises a current tax charge of EUR143.4M and a deferred 
tax charge of EUR7.4M relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment recognised 
in the income statement.
 5.            Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR4.7M is the fair value of various share options 
granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in accordance with 
employee services rendered.
 6.            Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.

In 2004 the Group changed the presentation of income from bonuses received from suppliers for meeting certain 
turnover levels. Previously the Group presented the income in the financial activities. Since the financial statements 
prepared for the first half of 2004 the Group decreases the cost of sales by the amount of bonuses received. In 
order to ensure comparability the Group changed the presentation for the first half of 2003. The amount of 
reclassified bonuses relating to the first half of 2003 was PLN 1,001 thousand.

 condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the six
 months ended September 30, 2009 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries
 (together referred to as the "Group").
These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the
 interim financial statements"), which should be read in conjunction with our
 2009 Annual Report, have been prepared in accordance with International
 Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as adopted by the
 EU ("IAS 34"). They do not include all of the information required for full
 annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most
 recent published consolidated financial statements of the Group. The
 consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the year ended
 March 31, 2009 are available at www.ryanair.com.
 The comparative figures included for the year ended March 31, 2009 do not
 constitute statutory financial statements of the Group within the meaning of
 Regulation 40 of the European Communities (Companies, Group Accounts)
 Regulations, 1992. Statutory financial statements for the year ended March 31,
 2009 have been filed with the Companies' Office. The auditors' report on those
 financial statements was unqualified.
In addition to the presentation of the condensed consolidated interim financial
 statements for the half-year period ended September 30, 2009, the condensed
 consolidated income statement and condensed consolidated statement of
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -12-
 comprehensive income for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 have also been
 provided on a supplementary basis and have been prepared in accordance with the
 measurement and recognition principles of IFRS as adopted by the EU.  The
 quarterly financial information does not include all information required for
 interim financial reporting under IAS 34.
 The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors,
 approved the interim financial statements for the six months ended September 30,
 2009 on October 30, 2009.
Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been
 prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most
 recent published consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in
 accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and in compliance with IFRSs as issued
 by the International Accounting Standards Board.
The following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the
 first time for the financial year beginning 1 April 2009.
*  IFRS 8 - Operating Segments ("IFRS 8"). We adopted IFRS 8 which replaces IAS 14
 - Segmental Reporting ("IAS 14"), during the six months ended 30 September 2009.
 IFRS 8 requires a "management approach" under which segment information is
 presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes. IAS 14
 required identification of two sets of segments - one based on business units
 and the other on geographical areas. IFRS 8 requires additional disclosures
 around identifying segments and their products and services. Our operations are
 organised as a single business unit, that of the provision of low-fares
 airline-related activities, including scheduled services, car hire, internet
 income and related sales to third parties. There has been no change to the
 operating segment as a result of the adoption of IFRS 8 and the reportable
 segment is consistent with that previously reported under the primary business
 segment format of the segment reporting under IAS 14. The additional disclosures
 around identifying segments and their products and services will be disclosed in
 the 2010 annual financial statements.  Comparative segment information has been
 represented, where necessary, in conformity with the transitional requirements
 of IFRS 8. Since the change in accounting policy only impacts the presentation
 and disclosure aspects, there is no impact on reported results or earnings per
 share.
*  IAS 1 (revised) - Presentation of Financial Statements. The revised standard
 prohibits the presentation of items of income and expenses (that is "non owner
 changes in equity") in the statement of changes in equity, requiring "non owner
 changes in equity" to be presented separately from owner changes in equity. All
 "non owner changes in equity" are required to be shown in a performance
 statement. Entities can choose whether to present one performance statement (the
 statement of comprehensive income) or two statements (the income statement and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -12-
 the statement of comprehensive income). We have elected to present two
 statements: an income statement and a statement of comprehensive income. Also,
 the revised standard includes the statement of changes in shareholders' equity
 as a primary statement, rather than as a note to the financial statements.
*  Amendment to IFRS 7 "Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments".The
 relevant aspects of the amendment will be addressed in the 2010 Annual Report
 disclosures.
The following standards, amendments to IFRS standards, IFRIC interpretations and
 improvements to IFRSs are mandatory for the first time for the financial year
 beginning 1 April 2009, but did not have an impact on the Company.
 *  Amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 27 "Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary,
 Jointly-Controlled Entity or Associate";
 *  Amendment to IFRS 2, "Share-based Payment - Vesting Conditions and
 Cancellations";
 *  Amendment to IAS 23, "Borrowing Costs";
 *  Amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1 regarding puttable financial instruments and
 obligations arising on liquidation;
 *  Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7, "Reclassification of Financial Assets";
 *  Amendment to IFRIC 9 and IAS 39 "Embedded Derivatives";
 *  IFRIC 15, "Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate";
 *  IFRIC 16, "Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation";
 *  IFRIC 17, "Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners";
 *  IFRIC 18, "Transfer of Assets from Customers"; and
 *  'Improvements to IFRSs 2008' (issued in May 2008).
The following standards, amendments to IFRS standards and interpretations have
 been issued, but are not effective for the financial year beginning 1 April 2009
 and have not been early adopted by the Company:
 *  IFRS 3 (revised) - Business Combinations and consequential amendments to IAS 27
 - Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, IAS 28 - Investments in
 Associates and IAS 31 - Interests in Joint Ventures, effective prospectively to
 business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the
 beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 July
 2009.
 *  Amendment to IFRS 2, "Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions";
 *  Amendment to IAS 32 "Classification of Rights Issues";
 *  Amendment to IAS 39 "Eligible Hedged Items"; and
 *  'Improvement to IFRSs 2009' (issued in April 2009).
Exceptional items
 The Company presents certain items separately, which are unusual, by virtue of
 their size and incidence, in the context of our ongoing core operations, as we
 believe this presentation represents the underlying business more accurately and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -12-
 reflects the manner in which investors typically analyse the results. In the
 current and prior period comparative we have presented an impairment of a
 financial asset investment and also accelerated depreciation related to aircraft
 disposals separately because of the unusual nature of these items. Any amounts
 deemed "exceptional" for management discussion and analysis purposes have been
 classified for the purposes of the income statement in the same way as non
 exceptional amounts of the same nature.
2.  Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements,
 estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual
 results may differ from these estimates.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements
 made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key
 sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the
 most recent published consolidated financial statements.
3.  Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to
 quarter, and management expects these variations to continue. Among the factors
 causing these variations are the airline industry's sensitivity to general
 economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Accordingly the first
 half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
4.  Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the
 half-year ended September 30, 2009 was 10.9% (2008: 9.4%). The tax charge for
 the half-year ended September 30, 2009 of EUR45.9m (2008: EUR9.9m) primarily
 comprises a deferred tax charge relating to the utilisation of previous trading
 losses.
5.  Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most
 recent published consolidated financial statements.  The charge to the income
 statement in the half-year of approximately EUR2.8m (2008: EUR1.5m) is related to
 the fair value of various share options granted in prior periods, which are
 being recognised within the income statement in accordance with employee
 services rendered.
6.  Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its
 business.  The Group does not believe that any such litigation will individually
 or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
 Group. Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, management
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Half Year Results -12-
 believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not
 expected to materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or
 financial position.

Ryanair Holdings PLC
05 October 2006
Not for release, publication or distribution, in whole or in part, in or into or
  from Australia, Canada, Japan, South Africa or the United States or any other
                 jurisdiction where it would be unlawful to do so
RYANAIR ADVISES THAT IT HAS ACQUIRED A 16% STAKE IN AER LINGUS AND ANNOUNCES AN
         ALL-CASH OFFER OF EUR2.80 PER SHARE VALUING AER LINGUS AT EUR1.481BN
The board of Ryanair Holdings plc today (5th October 2006) advises that it has
acquired over 16% of the issued share capital of Aer Lingus Group plc. Ryanair
now announces its intention to make an all cash offer of EUR2.80 per share for the
issued share capital of Aer Lingus not already in the ownership of Ryanair. This
offer is conditional on, among other things, obtaining at least a majority of
the shares in Aer Lingus. This cash offer values Aer Lingus at approximately
EUR1.481bn and represents a premium of 27% (approximately) over last week's IPO
share price of EUR2.20 per share and a premium of 12% (approximately) over last
evening's closing price for Aer Lingus shares of EUR2.51.
The share price appreciation since the Aer Lingus IPO occurred during the same
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus
short period in which Ryanair acquired over 16% of Aer Lingus shares at an
average price of EUR2.42 per share. During the 2nd and 3rd of October - the two
days during which Ryanair was not actively buying Aer Lingus shares - the share
price fell back from EUR2.48 to EUR2.41.
Speaking at the launch of the offer this morning, Ryanair's CEO, Michael
O'Leary, said:
        "This offer represents a unique opportunity to form one strong airline
         group for Ireland and for European consumers. We will expand, enhance
         and upgrade the Aer Lingus operations. This offer - if successful -
         means both companies will continue to operate separately and compete
         vigorously in the small number of routes on which we both operate -
         currently around 17 of the approximately 500 routes operated by the two
         airlines. We believe the price of EUR2.80 to be an excellent offer. If
         accepted the Irish Government will realise over EUR500m from the sale of
         their Aer Lingus shares, and the employees will realise over EUR220m which
         equates to an average of over EUR60,000 per employee."
The combined strength of Ryanair and Aer Lingus would establish an Irish airline
group with over 50m passengers annually, capable of competing on the European
and World stage against other large European airline groups, including Lufthansa
/SAS/Swiss (75m passengers), Air France/KLM (70m passengers) and BA/Iberia (63m
passengers). As the European airline industry consolidates, this acquisition, if
it proceeds, will largely replicate previous consolidations in, for example,
France (Air France/Brit Air/Regionale/KLM), UK (BA/B.Cal/DanAir/City Express),
Germany (Lufthansa/Eurowings/Lufthansa Cityline/Swiss) and Scandinavia (SAS/
Braethens).
There are benefits of combining these two Irish and European airlines into one
group. To give a flavour of what this offer - if successful - might mean to Aer
Lingus, its stakeholders and the people of Ireland and Europe, Ryanair intends
to:-
   Reduce Aer Lingus' average short haul fare (EUR87.55 in 2005) by 2 1/2% a
     year for a minimum period of four years;
    Reduce Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges as the price of oil falls from recent
     highs;
    Retain the Aer Lingus brand;
    Retain the Heathrow slots;
    Retain all profitable routes currently operated by Aer Lingus;
    Reduce Aer Lingus' costs through improved efficiencies and Ryanair's
     superior purchasing power;
    Give Aer Lingus access to the benefit of Ryanair's lower cost aircraft
     deliveries and lower cost financing facilities;
    Upgrade Aer Lingus' transatlantic fleet and improve its long haul
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus
     product;
    Maintain Aer Lingus as a stand alone, separate company within one strong
     Irish airline group under common ownership but run as separate competing
     airlines.
As the above benefits demonstrate, the Board of Ryanair intends to deliver a
publicly owned, Irish managed and headquartered airline group with the necessary
ambition, expertise, financial strength and cost base to take on European and
Global competitors well into the future. As an island nation, Ireland is
critically dependant upon strong and secure low fare airline services in order
to sustain and develop tourism and economic growth. Investing in Aer Lingus is
attractive for Ryanair and its shareholders because, amongst other things, Aer
Lingus' earnings yield is superior to the returns currently available on
Ryanair's cash deposits. Ryanair believes that there will be opportunities (by
combining the purchasing power of Ryanair and Aer Lingus) to reduce operating
costs, to increase efficiencies and to pass on these savings in the form of low
fares to the travelling public.
Ryanair has grown to be Europe's largest low fares airline by continuously
lowering prices and funding these reductions through cost savings and
efficiencies. We believe there is an opportunity to apply this successful low
fares formula to Aer Lingus where currently, in its short haul operation, fares
and costs remain far too high. We would also expect to work closely with Aer
Lingus, if the offer is successful, to improve its long haul operations where we
believe there is room to upgrade the long haul fleet and improve this product
which has not kept pace with the competition in recent years. Since we envisage
that the two companies would be run separately, in the event that this offer is
successful, nothing in this transaction will deflect Ryanair from continuing to
focus on its own pan-European expansion or from continuing to deliver unit cost
reductions and continuing to offer lower fares to millions of Ryanair's European
passengers.
There are numerous precedents across Europe (for example, in the UK, France,
Spain, Germany and Scandinavia) for two airlines of similar nationality coming
together to form a stronger, more widely diversified airline group. The European
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus
Union has recognised the value of competitive European airline consolidation
because of the benefits which it brings to consumers. This offer, if successful,
will result in that precedent being largely replicated here in Ireland and
elsewhere, with the added benefit that customers of Aer Lingus will enjoy lower
fares in the short haul market, a better product and service in the long haul
market by reducing fuel surcharges as oil prices fall, as Ryanair applies its
philosophy of lower costs and lower fares to Aer Lingus' existing business.
In accordance with the strict rules which apply to takeovers, Ryanair is limited
in its ability to answer questions in relation to this offer.
This release should be read in conjunction with the full text of the rule 2.5

Length: 1447 words
Body
 The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for purposes of the 
preparation of future financial statements, where applicable. We do not anticipate that the adoption of 
these new or revised standards and interpretations will have a material impact on our financial position 
or results from operations.
 --      IAS 32 (amendment) "Financial instruments: Presentation-offsetting financial assets and financial 
liabilities" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IAS 36 (amendment) "Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets" (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IAS 39 (amendment) "Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting" (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IFRIC 21 "Levies" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments" (2009, as amended in 2011) (effective date to be determined).
 2.       Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in 
applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as 
those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.       Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Accordingly 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.       Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the six months ended September 
30, 2013 was 12.2% (September 30, 2012: 12.3%).  The tax charge for the half-year ended September 30, 2013 
of EUR83.5m (September 30, 2012: EUR83.7m) comprises a deferred tax charge relating to the temporary 
differences for property, plant and equipment recognised in the income statement.
 5.       Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements.  The charge of EUR1.0m is the fair value of various share options 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Yearly Report -7-
granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in accordance with 
employee services rendered.
 6.       Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.       Capital commitments
 At September 30, 2013 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 301 (2012: 298) Boeing 737-800NG aircraft.  
Following shareholder approval at an EGM on June 18, 2013, the Group has agreed to purchase 175 new Boeing 
737 800NG aircraft between fiscal 2015 and 2019.
 8.       Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR221.2m at March 31, 2013 to EUR242.0m at 
September 30, 2013 is comprised of a gain of EUR20.8m, recognised through other comprehensive income, 
reflecting the increase in the Aer Lingus share price from EUR1.39 per share at March 31, 2013 to EUR1.52 
per share at September 30, 2013.
 9.       Analysis of operating segment
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car hire, internet income and related sales to third parties. The Company 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource 
allocation decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation 
decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, 
which are uniform in type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise 
consolidated financial results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated profit/(loss) after tax of 
the Company for the period.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed 
across the Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment 
operations.  In addition, as the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and 
liabilities have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

 Acquisitions
 Capital expenditure in the half-year amounted to EUR291.7m and is primarily aircraft pre delivery 
payments and the cost of spare engines purchased during the period.
 12.     Financial instruments and financial risk management
 Financial risk factors
 We are exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. Our financial risk 
exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The 
Company uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 The half-year financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2013 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies since year-end.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --  Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the 
Group can access at the measurement date.
 --  Level 2: Inputs other that quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that asset 
or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --  Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

 Aer Lingus response to decision by
 UK Competition Appeal Tribunal
 Dublin & London, 15 July 2015: Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus") notes today's judgment by the UK 
Competition Appeal Tribunal dismissing Ryanair's challenge to the decision of the Competition and Markets 
Authority ("CMA") which confirmed that there has been no material change in circumstances or special 
reason for it not to implement the findings of its Final Report of 28(th) August 2013 in which it 
concluded that Ryanair must reduce its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus to 5%.
 This follows yesterday's decision by the UK Supreme Court refusing Ryanair's application for permission 
to appeal against the Court of Appeal's judgment of 12 February 2015. That judgment had upheld the 
findings of the CMA's Final Report.

they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3 of the Irish Takeover Rules. Under the 
provisions of Rule 8.1 of the Irish Takeover Rules, all "dealings" in "relevant securities" of Aer Lingus by IAG or 
"relevant securities" of IAG by Aer Lingus, or by any person "acting in concert" with either of them must also be 
disclosed by no later than 12 noon (Irish time) on the "business day" following the date of the relevant transaction.
 A disclosure table, giving details of the companies in whose "relevant securities" "dealings" should be disclosed 
can be found on the Irish Takeover Panel's website at www.irishtakeoverpanel.ie. "Interests in securities" arise, in 
summary, when a person has long economic exposure, whether conditional or absolute, to changes in the price of 
securities. In particular, a person will be treated as having an "interest" by virtue of the ownership or control of 
securities, or by virtue of any option in respect of, or derivative referenced to, securities. Terms in quotation marks 
are defined in the Irish Takeover Rules, which can be found on the Irish Takeover Panel's website.
 If you are in any doubt as to whether or not you are required to disclose a "dealing" under Rule 8, please consult

 but permission was refused. On June 15, 2012, the OFT referred the investigation of Ryanair's minority stake in 
Aer Lingus to the UK Competition Commission. On August 28, 2013, the UKCC issued its final decision in which it 
stated that Ryanair's shareholding "gave it the ability to exercise material influence over Aer Lingus" and "had led or 
may be expected to lead to a substantial lessening of competition in the markets for air passenger services 
between Great Britain and Ireland."  As a result of its findings, the UKCC ordered Ryanair to reduce its 
shareholding in Aer Lingus to below 5 percent of Aer Lingus' issued ordinary shares.  Ryanair appealed the UKCC's 
final decision to the CAT on September 23, 2013.  The CAT rejected Ryanair's appeal on March 7, 2014.  On April 
23, 2014, the CAT granted Ryanair permission to appeal the CAT's judgment to the UK Court of Appeal. 
 Should this appeal, or any subsequent appeal to the UK Supreme Court be unsuccessful, Ryanair could suffer 
losses due to the negative impact on market prices of the forced sale of such a significant portion of Aer Lingus' 
shares.  Ryanair believes that the enforcement of any such decision should be delayed until the outcome of 
Ryanair's appeal against the European Commission's February 2013 prohibition decision of Ryanair's 2012 offer for 
Aer Lingus, as described below, and the conclusion of any appeals against the UKCC's decision in the UK courts.  
However, it is possible that the UKCC will seek to enforce any such sell-down remedy at an earlier date.
 On June 19, 2012, Ryanair made a third offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of Aer Lingus it did not own at a 
price of EUR1.30 per ordinary share.  The timing of the offer was influenced by: (i) the continued consolidation of 
European airlines, and more recently the International Airlines Group (the parent company of British Airways) 
takeover of British Midland International, where the No. 1 airline at Heathrow was allowed to acquire the No. 2; (ii) 
the additional capacity available at Dublin airport following the opening of Terminal 2 and the decline in traffic from 
23.3 million passengers per annum in 2007 to 18.7 million in 2011, has resulted in Dublin airport operating at 
approximately 50% capacity; (iii) the change in the Irish government policy since 2006 in that the Irish government 
indicated that it had decided to sell its stake in Aer Lingus; (iv) the fact that under the terms of the bailout agreement 
provided by the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund to Ireland, the 
Irish government committed to sell its stake in Aer Lingus; (v) the fact that the ESOT (Employee Share Ownership 
Trust), which at the time of the unsuccessful 2006 offer controlled 15% of Aer Lingus, had been disbanded since 
December 2010 and the shares distributed to the individual members, with the result that Ryanair's new offer was, 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -36-
in Ryanair's view, capable of reaching over 50% acceptance either with or without government acceptance; and (vi) 
the fact that Etihad, an Abu Dhabi based airline, had recently acquired a 3% stake in Aer Lingus and had expressed 
an interest in buying the government's 25% stake in Aer Lingus (the offer therefore provided Etihad or any other 
potential bidder the opportunity to purchase the government's stake).
 Ryanair offered to keep Aer Lingus as a separate company, maintain the Aer Lingus brand, and to grow its traffic 
from 9.5 million to over 14.5 million passengers over a five year period post acquisition, by growing Aer Lingus' 
short haul traffic at some of Europe's major airports where Aer Lingus currently operates and Ryanair does not. 
Ryanair also intended to increase Aer Lingus' transatlantic traffic from Ireland, which has fallen in recent years, by 
investing in operations. If the offer was accepted, the Irish government would have received EUR173 million in 
cash. The offer of EUR1.30 per share represented a premium of approximately 38% over the closing price of 
EUR0.94 for Aer Lingus shares as of June 19, 2012. The offer was conditional on competition approval by the 
European Commission. However, on February 27, 2013, the European Commission prohibited the acquisition by 
Ryanair of the remaining share capital of Aer Lingus. Ryanair appealed this prohibition to the EU General Court on 
May 8, 2013. A judgment in this appeal is expected in 2015.
 The available-for-sale financial asset balance sheet value of EUR260.3 million reflects the market value of the 
Company's stake in Aer Lingus as of March 31, 2014, as compared to a value of EUR221.2 million as of March 31, 
2013. In accordance with the company's accounting policy, this investment is held at fair value. This investment is 
classified as available-for-sale, rather than as an investment in an associate, because the Company does not have 
the power to exercise any influence over Aer Lingus. The increase in the amount of the available for sale financial 
asset from EUR221.2 million at March 31, 2013 to EUR260.3 million at March 31, 2014 is comprised of a gain of 
EUR39.1 million, recognized through other comprehensive income, reflecting the increase in Aer Lingus' share 
price from EUR1.39 per share at March 31, 2013 to EUR1.64 per share at March 31, 2014. All impairment losses 
are required to be recognized in the income statement for investments in an equity instrument classified for 
available for sale and are not subsequently reversed, while gains are recognized through other comprehensive 
income.  The investment had in prior periods been impaired to EUR0.50 per share.
 The Company's determination that it does not have control, or even exercise a "significant influence," over Aer 
Lingus through its minority shareholding has been based on the following factors:
 (i) Ryanair does not have any representation on the Aer Lingus Board of Directors; nor does it have a right to 
appoint a director;
 (ii) Ryanair does not participate in Aer Lingus policy-making decisions; nor does it have a right to participate in 
such policy-making decisions;
 (iii) There are no material transactions between Ryanair and Aer Lingus, there is no interchange of personnel 
between the two companies and there is no sharing of technical information between the companies;
 (iv) Aer Lingus and its significant shareholder (the Irish government: 25.1%) have historically openly opposed 
Ryanair's investment or participation in the company;
 (v) In 2007, 2009 and 2010, Aer Lingus refused Ryanair's attempt to assert its statutory right to requisition a 
general meeting (a legal right of any 5% shareholder under Irish law);
 (vi) On April 15, 2011, the High Court in Dublin ruled that Aer Lingus was not obliged to accede to Ryanair's 
request that two additional resolutions (on the payment of a dividend and on payments to pension schemes) be put 
to vote at Aer Lingus' annual general meeting; and
 (vii) The European Commission has formally found that Ryanair's shareholding in Aer Lingus does not grant 
Ryanair "de jure or de facto control of Aer Lingus" and that "Ryanair's rights as a minority shareholder...are 
associated exclusively to rights related to the protection of minority shareholders" (Commission Decision Case No. 
COMP/M.4439 dated October 11, 2007). The European Commission's finding has been confirmed by the European 
Union's General Court which issued a decision on July 6, 2010 that the European Commission was justified to use 
the required legal and factual standard in its refusal to order Ryanair to divest its minority shareholding in Aer 
Lingus and that, as part of that decision, Ryanair's shareholding did not confer control of Aer Lingus (Judgment of 
the General Court (Third Chamber) Case No. T-411/07 dated July 6, 2010).
 Historical Results Are Not Predictive of Future Results
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -36-
 The historical results of operations discussed herein may not be indicative of Ryanair's future operating 
performance. Ryanair's future results of operations will be affected by, among other things, overall passenger traffic 
volume; the availability of new airports for expansion; fuel prices; the airline pricing environment in a period of 
increased competition; the ability of Ryanair to finance its planned acquisition of aircraft and to discharge the 
resulting debt service obligations; economic and political conditions in Ireland, the U.K. and the EU; terrorist threats 
or attacks within the EU; seasonal variations in travel; developments in government regulations, litigation and labor 
relations; foreign currency fluctuations, the impact of the banking crisis and potential break-up of the euro; 
competition and the public's perception regarding the safety of low-fares airlines; the value of its equity stake in Aer 
Lingus; changes in aircraft acquisition, leasing, and other operating costs; flight interruptions caused by volcanic 
ash emissions or other atmospheric disruptions; flight disruptions caused by periodic and prolonged air traffic 
controller strikes in Europe; the rates of income and corporate taxes paid, and the impact of the financial and 
Eurozone crisis. Ryanair expects its depreciation, staff and fuel charges to increase as additional aircraft and 
related flight equipment are acquired. Future fuel costs may also increase as a result of the depletion of petroleum 
reserves, the shortage of fuel production capacity and/or production restrictions imposed by fuel oil producers. 
Maintenance expenses may also increase as a result of Ryanair's fleet expansion and replacement program. In 
addition, the financing of new Boeing 737-800 aircraft will increase the total amount of the Company's outstanding 
debt and the payments it is obliged to make to service such debt. The cost of insurance coverage for certain third-
party liabilities arising from "acts of war" or terrorism increased dramatically following the September 11, 2001 
terrorist attacks. Although Ryanair currently passes on increased insurance costs to passengers by means of a 
special "insurance levy" on each ticket, there can be no assurance that it will continue to be successful in doing so.

(the "Transparency Rules") and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/761 of 17 December 2014.
 (ii) Full name of the legal entity and other identifying specification of the issuer or underlying issuer, provided it is

 Ryanair Holdings PLC
 19 December 2008
 ab/MOL/12046
18 December 2008
Mr Colm
 Barrington
 Chairman
 Aer Lingus Group plc
 Head Office
 Dublin
 Airport      OPEN LETTER
Dear Chairman,
We refer to Aer Lingus'
 recent interim management statement dated 11 Nov 08 and the subsequent comments
 and claims made by Aer Lingus group management following the launch of Ryanair's
 recent merger offer. We, as a large shareholder, are concerned about some of
 these apparently contradictory claims and forecasts, and their impact upon Aer
 Lingus' forecast post exceptional net profit (loss) after tax for 2008 and
 2009.
We believe all shareholders would appreciate and are entitled to
 receive a detailed clarification of the impact of the following items on Aer
Ryanair Holdings PLC Shareholder Letter to Aer Lingus Chairman
 Lingus' forecast post exceptional net profit (loss) after tax, and net cash
 balances, for 2008 and 2009.
1.       How much cash compensation and
 exceptional costs have been, or will be, incurred to deliver the recently
 announced "transformational deal"?  Is the reported cost of EUR100m an accurate
 one, or is the final cost greater than this figure? Please confirm for all
 shareholders that this "transformation" will only reduce Aer Lingus' costs by as
 little as EUR5 per passenger.
2.      We note that a similar team (to
 that in 2006), led by Goldman Sachs, has been appointed by Aer Lingus to defend
 Ryanair's current merger offer. Since Aer Lingus previously spent over EUR24m of
 shareholder funds defending a higher offer (in Oct 2006), can the company
 confirm for all shareholders the amount of the cap, referred to by you before
 the parliamentary committee today, which has been placed on Aer Lingus' defence
 costs this time around.
3.      Can the company confirm for all
 shareholders the current (Dec 2008) deficit in the Aer Lingus defined benefit
 pension schemes?  In light of the recent collapse in Irish pension scheme
 valuations, can the company confirm that its pension schemes are fully funded or
 will a further exceptional cost increase (in the form of pension contribution
 top ups) be required by Aer Lingus Group plc to fund the hole in its pension
 schemes?
4.      Since the company last week announced that it would
 eliminate long haul fuel surcharges with immediate effect, can the  company
 please confirm for all shareholders the impact of this revenue loss on Aer
 Lingus' forecast post exceptional net profit (loss) after tax for 2008 and
 2009.
5.      Since Aer Lingus Group plc has previously forecast an
 operating loss of approx. EUR20m in 2008 (11 Nov interim statement)  and another
 operating loss of approx. EUR70m in 2009 (investor conference call 28th Aug 2008),
 can the company, in light of the above substantial cost increases and revenue
 reductions, please confirm its forecast post exceptional net profit (loss) after
 tax for both 2008 and 2009.
6.      During the course of Aer Lingus'
 most recent investor conference call (28th Aug 2008), the company forecast that
 its net  cash balance would decline to "about EUR550m" by the end of 2009. In
 light of the impact of: (i) the substantial cost increases outlined above,  (ii)
 the loss of revenue arising from the elimination of fuel surcharges, (iii) the
 impact of the company's current fuel hedges, (iv) the compensation cost for the
 recent "transformational deal", and (v) the company's expected defence fees, can
 the company please confirm for all shareholders its revised forecast net cash
 balances at year end 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2009.
7.     Can
 the company please explain to all shareholders the apparent contradiction
 between Aer Lingus' interim statement of just 5 weeks ago (11 Nov 2008) (in
 which Aer Lingus announced capacity reductions on its long haul and short haul
 network) with its recent statements to the media and at today's parliamentary
 committee of a campaign of growth in 2009. Can the company please confirm for
 all shareholders its revised capacity and capex forecast for 2009 and its impact
 on the company's forecast net cash balance of "about EUR550m" by the end of
 2009.
Like all other investors in Aer Lingus Group plc, we would
 appreciate a detailed clarification of the above issues and their impact on
Ryanair Holdings PLC Shareholder Letter to Aer Lingus Chairman
 forecast post exceptional net profit (loss) after tax in 2008 and again in 2009,
 for all shareholders, in your forthcoming defence document. As I'm sure you will
 appreciate, the above issues will be of utmost importance to all stakeholders in
 maximising shareholder value in Aer Lingus Group plc.
Yours sincerely,
______________
 Michael O'Leary

4. Information on Ryanair and Coinside
Ryanair operates a low fares scheduled passenger airline serving short haul,
 point-to-point routes in Europe from its 31 bases at Dublin, London (Stansted),
 Glasgow (Prestwick), Brussels (Charleroi), Frankfurt (Hahn), Milan (Bergamo),

 Midlands, London (Luton), Birmingham, Liverpool, Shannon, Pisa, Belfast, Kerry,
 Edinburgh, Bristol, Bournemouth, Bremen, Dusseldorf, Marseille, Madrid,
 Alicante, Reus, Alghero, Cagliari, Trapani, Bologna and Cork airports, which
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer -4-
 together are referred to as "Ryanair's bases of operations" or "Ryanair's
 bases". In operation since 1985, Ryanair pioneered the low fares operating model
 in Europe under a new management team in the early 1990s. As of 28 November
 2008, the Company offered 1,040 scheduled short haul flights per day serving 148
 locations throughout Europe, including 26 locations in the United Kingdom and
 Ireland, with an operating fleet of 108 aircraft flying approximately 793
 routes.
Ryanair had a turnover and operating profit before taxation of EUR2,713,822,000
 and EUR438,927,000 respectively for the year ended 31 March, 2008.
Coinside is a wholly owned non-operating subsidiary of Ryanair. Coinside has not
 traded except for entering into transactions relating to Aer Lingus Shares.
Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley are acting as financial advisers to
 Ryanair and Coinside.
5. Reasons for the Offer and Ryanair's Strategy for Aer Lingus
The Board of Ryanair proposes to merge the two airlines into one strong Irish
 airline group under common ownership. Similar to previous European airline
 mergers such as Air France/KLM and Lufthansa/Swiss, both airlines will operate
 separately, with separate distinctive brands, thereby preserving the best
 features of both, including Ryanair's low fare, high punctuality operations, and
 Aer Lingus' special brand, service culture, and long haul operations. The
 Chairman of Aer Lingus will be invited to join the Board of Ryanair.
Ryanair believes that Aer Lingus is an isolated, uncompetitive, loss making EU
 flag carrier which has been bypassed by ongoing EU wide airline consolidation,
 and needs to find a strong airline partner to secure its future. Over the past
 two years, the trading environment and competitive landscape for all European
 airlines has deteriorated dramatically with high oil prices and the global
 recession. This has triggered a wave of airline closures and failures (in all,
 over 30 airlines have failed this year). In response, EU airline consolidation
 has accelerated as Europe sees the emergence of three large mega-carriers, Air
 France, British Airways and Lufthansa, and the rapid growth of Ryanair, Europe's
 largest low fares airline.
Ryanair believes that the harsh economic downturn, coupled with accelerating
 industry consolidation, leave Aer Lingus exposed to the risk that, as a small,
 isolated, uncompetitive and loss making airline, it will be unable to survive as
 a viable independent operator. Ryanair believes that today's Offer for Aer
 Lingus provides a financially strong partner, in one strong Irish airline group,
 within which Aer Lingus can continue to retain its special brand while improving
 its competitive base by lowering fares, eliminating fuel surcharges and reducing
 costs.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Announces Cash Offer -4-
Against this background, Ryanair looks forward to receiving EU Commission
 clearance for this pro-consumer combination. European governments and the EU
 Commission have faced up to economic realities in endorsing consolidation over
 competition in both the airline and banking sectors and Ryanair hopes that a
 similar level of realism will be adopted in this scenario.
The Board of Ryanair believes that there are significant consumer benefits of
 combining these two Irish and European airlines for the stakeholders and
 customers of Aer Lingus and makes the following commitments:
üTo cut Aer Lingus' average short haul fares (approximately EUR94 in 2007) by 5%
 for 3 years (generating an approx EUR40 million annual saving for consumers)
 üTo eliminate Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges on completion (generating an approx
 EUR100 million annual saving for consumers)
 üTo retain the Aer Lingus brand, guarantee the Cork and Dublin slots at Heathrow
 and secure Heathrow connectivity for Ireland at lower fares
 üTo double the size of Aer Lingus' short haul fleet (from 33 to 66 aircraft)
 creating a minimum of 1,000 associated new jobs over the next 5 years following
 the successful completion of the Offer
 üTo run Aer Lingus as a separate company under common ownership with Ryanair
 (like Air France/KLM and Lufthansa/Swiss) but competing on the routes where it
 overlaps with Ryanair
As an island nation with an economy in recession, it is critical that Ireland
 continues to benefit from strong and secure low fare airline services in order
 to sustain and support tourism and economic growth. Ryanair believes that the
 Offer may help to combat recent Irish traffic and tourism declines.
As outlined above, the Board of Ryanair envisages that the two companies would
 be run as separate subsidiaries of Ryanair Holdings plc so that nothing in this
 transaction will deflect Ryanair Limited from continuing to relentlessly focus
 on its own pan-European expansion, navigating the current industry downturn by
 lowering costs and thereby, Ryanair believes, doubling traffic and profits by
 2012. In addition, Ryanair shareholders will benefit as there will be
 opportunities (through the combination of Ryanair's and Aer Lingus' combined
 purchasing power and marketing skills) to further reduce operating costs and
 increase efficiencies.
6. Financing
The Offer will be financed from the cash reserves of Ryanair.
Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley confirm they are satisfied that
 resources are available to Ryanair sufficient to satisfy full acceptance of the
 Offer.

Body
 Ryanair welcomed Manchester Airport Group's (MAG) purchase of Stansted Airport in March 2013.  We are in 
active discussions with MAG about a rapid traffic growth plan and we hope these talks will lead to a growth deal 
which will reverse the past 6 years of record traffic falls at Stansted, where the CAA's 'inadequate' regulatory 
regime has allowed prices to double and traffic to decline by 25% from 24m to 18m since 2007.  We believe that 
competition between airports should now deliver a better deal for Stansted users, where the CAA has repeatedly 
failed.
 Our recent firm order for 175 Boeing 737-800 aircraft clears the way for Ryanair to resume strong growth in fleet, 
routes and traffic over the 5 year period from fiscal 2015 to 2019.  The fact that we have secured phased deliveries 
over this period at pricing which is "not dissimilar" to our previous (2005) order emphasises the importance of 
Ryanair's long-term commitment to, and our partnership with, Boeing.  We have set up a senior team to study the 
B737-MAX and we have tasked them with reporting back before the end of September.  Subject to reaching 
commercial terms with Boeing we would hope to finalise a follow-on order sometime before the end of this fiscal 
year but there is no certainty that an agreement can be reached by that deadline.  Ryanair's success to date has 
been built on our selection of Boeing aircraft, and while we would not rule out a second aircraft type, we are 
confident that this new 175 aircraft order will provide a basis for another 5 years of strong growth in traffic, profits 
and shareholder returns
 Our passengers
 Ryanair delivers Europe's No. 1 customer service for the benefit of our passengers, our people and our 
shareholders.  We continue to grow by delivering lower fares, better punctuality, fewer lost bags, which is why we 
receive fewer passenger complaints than any other major airline in Europe.
 Despite the current EU recession, and the spread of austerity measures, Ryanair's lowest fares continue to 
encourage passengers to travel, and more importantly to switch to Ryanair's low fares.  Ryanair beats every other 
airline on price on every flight,  every route, every day.  We have grown to carry over 79.3m passengers and IATA's 
2012 traffic statistics confirm that Ryanair carries far more international passengers than any other scheduled 
airline, making Ryanair the "world's favourite airline".  Over the past year, Ryanair welcomed 79.3m passengers 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Financial Report -2-
onboard, at an average fare of just EUR48, which meant that these passengers saved over EUR7bn compared  to 
the high fares charged by our competitor's including Air France, British Airways, Easyjet and Lufthansa.
 Ryanair's growth and profitability is not based solely on price.  In addition to the lowest fares in every market last 
year, Ryanair also delivered:
--   The best punctuality        93% of flights on-time (up 2%).
--   Fewest lost bags            We lost less than 1 bag for every 3,000
 passengers carried, an improvement
 on the prior year
--   Fewest complaints           Last year we received less than 1 complaint
 per 2,000 passengers, an improvement
 on the prior year
 --   Youngest fleet              The average age of our 305 aircraft
 at year end is approximately 4.5 years.
 --   Rapid complaint responses    Over 99% replied to within 7 days.
--   The world's greenest        Independent research confirms Ryanair
 airline                     is the world's greenest/cleanest airline.
Our people
 Over the past year average staff numbers in Ryanair rose to 9,059.  Within this number, more than 350 people 
were promoted, as our growth created new opportunities for career progression and development.  Our people 
know that they can advance their careers by taking advantage of Ryanair's commitment to promote from within 
wherever possible.  At a time when many European airlines are cutting jobs, or cutting pay (as in the case of Air 
Berlin, Iberia and SAS in recent months), Ryanair is proud of its long-standing record of job creation, pay increases 
and internal promotions and, above all, job security.
 Our shareholders
 Unlike other airlines, Ryanair continues to deliver substantial returns for shareholders.  In Ryanair our Board and 
Management team hold a significant stake in the company, which means we think and act like shareholders, 
precisely because we are significant shareholders.
 Ryanair's increased profits and rising cash reserves allowed our Board to make a second special dividend of 
EUR0.34 per share (approx. EUR492m) to shareholders in November 2012.  We have completed a further share 
buyback in June 2013 amounting to EUR177m.  As a result of our continued growth, the Board has indicated its 
intention to make a further share buyback of up to EUR223m in fiscal year 2014, as well as return of up to 
EUR600.0m to shareholders through a third special dividend and/or share buyback in fiscal year 2015 representing 
a EUR1 bn return to shareholders over a two year period.  This will bring the total Ryanair has returned to 
shareholders to more than EUR2.53bn since fiscal year 2008.
 It is a remarkable fact that having raised just EUR585m from our flotation and four secondary offers between 1997 
and 2002 Ryanair will now return almost 5 times this amount (over EUR2.5bn) to shareholders by the end of 2015.
 Ryanair continues to look for opportunities to invest our cash wisely.  While we have now finalized a firm 175 
aircraft order which will enable us to grow to 110m passengers annually by fiscal year 2019, we hope to continue to 
manage this growth in a controlled, safe and profitable manner.  Our history has shown that we only order aircraft 
when we believe that pricing will make it profitable for our shareholders to do so and we believe we have achieved 
this again with our latest order.
 Finally, I would like to sincerely thank our Chairman, my fellow Board members, our Managers and all the team at 
Ryanair for their hard work and commitment over the past year, which has helped us deliver another year of low 
fare traffic growth and record profits for the benefit of our passengers, our people and our shareholders.
 Yours sincerely,
 Michael O'Leary

these new or revised standards and interpretations will have a material impact on our financial position 
or results from operations.
 --      IAS 32 (amendment) "Financial instruments: Presentation-offsetting financial assets and financial 
liabilities" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IAS 36 (amendment) "Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets" (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IAS 39 (amendment) "Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting" (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IFRIC 21 "Levies" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014).
 --      IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments" (2009, as amended in 2011) (effective date to be determined).
 2.       Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in 
applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as 
those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.       Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Accordingly 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.       Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the nine months ended December 
31, 2013 was 11.9% (December 31, 2012: 12.2%).  The tax charge for the nine months ended December 31, 2013 
of EUR76.9m (December 31, 2012: EUR84.9) comprises a deferred tax charge relating to the temporary 
differences for property, plant and equipment recognised in the income statement.
 5.        Share based payments
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -7-
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements.  The charge of EUR1.5m is the fair value of various share options 
granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in accordance with 
employee services rendered.
 6.        Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.        Capital commitments
 At December 31, 2013 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 298 (2012: 305) Boeing 737-800NG aircraft.  
Following shareholder approval at an EGM on June 18, 2013, the Group has agreed to purchase 175 new Boeing 
737 800NG aircraft between fiscal 2015 and 2019.
 8.       Available for sale financial assets (Aer Lingus)
 The movement on the available for sale financial asset from EUR221.2m at March 31, 2013 to EUR204.1m at 
December 31, 2013 is comprised of a loss of EUR17.1m, recognised through other comprehensive income, 
reflecting the decrease in the Aer Lingus share price from EUR1.39 per share at March 31, 2013 to EUR1.28 
per share at December 31, 2013.
 9.       Analysis of operating segment
 The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car hire, internet income and related sales to third parties. The Company 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the CEO, who is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource 
allocation decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data, however resource allocation 
decisions are made based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, 
which are uniform in type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise 
consolidated financial results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the consolidated profit/(loss) after tax of 
the Company for the period.
 All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Company has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Company's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed 
across the Company's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment 
operations.  In addition, as the Company is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and 
liabilities have been allocated to the Company's single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

 12.     Financial instruments and financial risk management
 Financial risk factors
 We are exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. Our financial risk 
exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The 
Company uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 The quarters financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2013 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies since year-end.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --   Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the 
Group can access at the measurement date.
