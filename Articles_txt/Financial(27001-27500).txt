Shares on the Dublin market slumped in morning trade today with banking stocks taking a beating as the ECB

By midday, the ISEQ was down 159.85 points to 4,284.93.
Irish banks are facing a fresh funding challenge as new measure are brought in by the ECB that will have the effect 
of cutting the amount of funds they will receive for mortgage asset backed securities, according to broker's analysts 
today.
'Some Irish banks have been using the ECB window as a source of funding using securities backed by mortgages,' 
NCB writes in a research note. 'These asset backed securities will be subject to a haircut which will reduce the level 
of funding the bank can receive.' Irish banks had borrowings of E44.1 billion from the ECB at 31 July 2008. The 
exposure of the retail clearing banks (Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, Danske Bank and Ulster Bank) was only 
E1 billion, notes NCB. Shares in AIB tumbled by 58c to e7.83, Bank of Ireland shed 39c to E5.14, Anglo Irish fell by

Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, increased its passenger volumes strongly last month in spite of the 
economic slowdown and weakening growth in demand for air travel across Europe.
The airline said its passenger numbers had increased by 19 per cent in August to 5.8m, almost in line with its rising 
capacity, as it takes a steady stream of new aircraft from Boeing.
Ryanair said that it had flown 55.1m passengers in the past 12 months.
It filled 90 per cent of its available seats in August, the busiest month of the year. This was marginally lower than 
the 91 per cent achieved a year ago but above the average of the past 12 months of 81 per cent.
The Irish carrier has been waging a price war for several weeks to try to stimulate traffic in the coming winter 
months as the market weakens.
Ryanair's underlying profits fell sharply in its first quarter from April to June and it warned that it could fall into loss in 
the full year for the first time since it was floated 11 years ago, under pressure from surging fuel costs and falling air 
fares.
It is reducing capacity at its main bases at London Stansted airport and Dublin airport during the winter season but 
its overall capacity will continue to grow.
British Airways said earlier this week that its passenger traffic had fallen in August despite an increase in capacity 
year on year, underlining the increasingly tough economic conditions facing world airlines.
BA filled 77.3 per cent of its available seats last month, down from 80 per cent in August last year. The airline last 
month disclosed its first quarter pre-tax profits had fallen 88 per cent and it announced plans to cut flights during the 
winter, to raise air fares, reduce capital spending and to cut jobs through natural attrition in an effort to cope with the 
surge in fuel costs.
Ryanair defies downturn with 19% rise in passengers
BA said this week that market conditions for the industry remained "very difficult with the strong dollar largely 
offsetting the benefit of the recent fall in oil price".

Proposals aimed at protecting air passenger rights and targeting flight advertisements were adopted today by the 
European Parliament in Brussels.
The Kirkhope Report on Computerised Reservation Systems or CRSs will regulate travel agents and airlines further 
to ensure price transparency for the customer and improved data protection as well as ensuring that the price 
advertised is the price that consumers pay.
Fine Gael MEP Jim Higgins, a member of the Transport Committee, said the report is extremely timely.
"With the adoption of this report we will see price advertised as the price you pay. We have been targeting airline 
websites and advertising for some time and now we have turned our attention to online websites and travel agents. 
Since the early 90s there has been a notable market shift with 40pc of all airline bookings now made online, with 
the remaining 60pc booked via travel agents and CRSs. "The Parliament also felt that we needed to ensure that 
customers at all times receive the best possible deal and that ownership of online websites, and CSRs is clear and 
transparent and that no discriminatory practice will be used when airlines and CSRs make deals. "It is unclear yet if 
this regulation will have any effect on the so called screenscraper issue recently involving Ryanair and Irish website 
bravofly.com. "I will contact the Commission to seek their interpretation of both Ryanair's response, and the 
possible impact the adoption of this regulation will have," said MEP Higgins. MEPS also voted to include a 
requirement that when a flight is under 90 minutes duration and it is possible to travel to your destination via rail that 
the best options for doing so must be present on the screen to allow you to make the most informed decision 
possible.

Aer Lingus is to table a package of cost cutting measures by the end of this month, its chief executive Dermot 
Mannion has said.
"We will be coming with a new package of measures by the end of September," he tells the Financial Times in an 
interview this morning.
"Everything is up for review. The challenge must be faced quickly.
"Fundamental change must happen. We must take out costs to reduce a potential 100m euro operating loss in 
2009." Mr Mannion declined in the interview to give no details of the cutbacks that will be proposed. However, he 
pointed to the 80 euro-a-seat costs that Aer Lingus bears on short haul flights, comparing the figure with 60 euro at 
EasyJet and 40 euro at Ryanair. He told the paper that Aer Lingus could not afford the traditional protracted pace of 
negotiations with its trades unions. It had taken about 18 months and several strike threats to negotiate the latest 
productivity improvements to 20m euro a year, which were implemented earlier this year. In the interview, Mr 
Mannion said that Aer Lingus intended to be one of the industry survivors. He said it enjoyed a strong balance 
sheet with net cash of 803m euro at the end of June.It was even planning substantial investment - placing new 
orders for more short-haul jets from 2010 and the establishment of its first operating bases in Britain or continental 
Europe. But in the short term further changes were needed in the operating cost base to help ensure long-term 
viability, he said.

Aer Lingus is to table a package of cost cutting measures by the end of this month, its chief executive Dermot 
Mannion has said.
"We will be coming with a new package of measures by the end of September," he tells the Financial Times in an 
interview this morning.
"Everything is up for review. The challenge must be faced quickly.
"Fundamental change must happen. We must take out costs to reduce a potential 100m euro operating loss in 
2009." Mr Mannion declined in the interview to give no details of the cutbacks that will be proposed. However, he 
pointed to the 80 euro-a-seat costs that Aer Lingus bears on short haul flights, comparing the figure with 60 euro at 
EasyJet and 40 euro at Ryanair. He told the paper that Aer Lingus could not afford the traditional protracted pace of 
negotiations with its trades unions. It had taken about 18 months and several strike threats to negotiate the latest 
productivity improvements to 20m euro a year, which were implemented earlier this year. In the interview, Mr 
Mannion said that Aer Lingus intended to be one of the industry survivors. He said it enjoyed a strong balance 
sheet with net cash of 803m euro at the end of June.It was even planning substantial investment - placing new 
orders for more short-haul jets from 2010 and the establishment of its first operating bases in Britain or continental 
Europe. But in the short term further changes were needed in the operating cost base to help ensure long-term 
viability, he said.

(ANSA) - Turin, September 4 - Irish low cost air carrier Ryanair will start on December 20, 2008 three new flights 
from the Levaldigi airport in Cuneo, in the northern Italian region of Piedmont. 
The flights will connect the Cuneo airport with Dublin, Birmingham and Stansted airport in London.
The information was announced by Ryanair deputy marketing director for Italy, Giovanna Gentile, in Cuneo on 
September 3. The new air connections will be operated once a week, Gentile added. 
Daniele Borioli, regional transport and infrastructure councillor, expressed his satisfaction with the launch of the new 
flights because this is a step forward in the airport's development.
Ryanair will launch on December 20, 2008 six flights from the Caselle airport in Turin, northern Italy, ANSA 
announced on September 2. The flights will connect Turin and Shannon in western Ireland and the UK airports 
Prestwick in Glasgow, East-Midlands in Nottingham, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Bournemouth.
Ryanair expects to transport 14 million passengers in Italy this year, ANSA wrote on May 7, 2008. In 2007, Ryanair 
transported a total 12.7 million passengers and in the period between 1998 and 2007 it carried 60 million 
passengers in Italy. The Italian market is the second largest for the company, generating a total 12 pct of the 
passenger traffic of Ryanair.

Ryanair Holdings Plc said on Thursday it carried 5.78 million passengers in August, 19 percent more than a year 
earlier, though the average flight was slightly less full.
Europe's biggest low-cost airline said its load factor, a measure of how well a carrier is filling available seats, was 
90 percent in the month, down from 91 percent in August 2007.
'Ryanair are confident that passenger numbers will continue to remain strong,' it said in a statement.

Aer Lingus prepares to shed weight to fly higher

Highlight: Interview Dermot Mannion Chief Executive, Aer Lingus
Another round of restructuring is due, writes Kevin Done
Body
Dermot Mannion of Aer Lingus has warned that the Irish flagship carrier must undertake "fundamental change" in 
order to minimise a "potential EUR100m operating loss in 2009".
The airline is preparing for more restructuring as it heads towards two years of potentially heavy losses.
This time, Mr Mannion says Aer Lingus cannot afford the luxury of protracted negotiations with its notoriously 
truculent trades unions. It took about 18 months and several strike threats to negotiate the latest productivity 
improvements, aimed at saving EUR20m (m$29) a year, which were finally implemented earlier this year.
Mr Mannion said in an interview with the Financial Times that Aer Lingus intended to be a survivor of the growing 
shake-out in the European airline industry - supported by one of the strongest balance sheets including net cash of 
EUR803m at the end of June. It was planning to place new orders for more short-haul jets from 2010 to support 
further expansion and the establishment of its first operating bases in Britain or continental Europe.
In the short term, further fundamental changes were needed in the group's operating cost base, however, to 
minimise looming losses in 2009 and to help ensure long-term viability.
"We will be coming with a new package of measures by the end of September," said Mr Mannion. "Everything is up 
for review. The challenge must be faced quickly . . . Fundamental change must happen. We must take out costs to 
reduce a potential EUR100m operating loss in 2009."
He said it cost Aer Lingus EUR80 to produce a short-haul seat compared with EUR60 at EasyJet and EUR40 at 
Ryanair, with the biggest cost differences being in labour and sales and distribution.
Last week the group disclosed that in the first half of this year it had fallen to an operating loss of EUR22.3m from a 
profit of EUR2.6m in the same period last year, largely as a result of an increase of EUR56.5m, or 48.7 per cent, in 
fuel costs.
Aer Lingus prepares to shed weight to fly higher
At best, the airline expected to break even in the second half of the year - it makes the lion's share of its profits from 
July to September - implying a pre-tax loss for this year of more than EUR20m.
Aer Lingus has been under attack from Ryanair ever since Europe's largest low-cost carrier failed in a takeover bid 
launched two years ago. The takeover was blocked last year by the European Commission on competition grounds, 
a decision Ryanair is still fighting in the European courts.
Ryanair, the biggest Aer Lingus shareholder with a stake of 29.8 per cent, this week renewed its verbal assault on 
its smaller rival, claiming that Aer Lingus's cost-reduction strategy had been "an abject failure" and that it believed 
the current board and management of Aer Lingus could "not deliver fundamental changes" in the cost base.
Ryanair said: "As the current wave of European airline mergers and takeovers gathers pace, it is clear that Aer 
Lingus is being marginalised on the sidelines of European aviation, losing money with no apparent strategy to 
return to profitability." Its independence strategy had not secured its long-term viability.
Since Aer Lingus was floated in September 2006 its share price has fallen by 26 per cent but Ryanair's 
performance in the same period has been worse, with a share price fall of 32 per cent. In the past 12 months, Aer 
Lingus has fallen by 37 per cent and Ryanair by 46 per cent. Ryanair, too, has warned it could fall into loss in its 
current financial year. Mr Mannion dismissed Ryanair's attack on the performance of Aer Lingus's new operating 
base in Belfast, and said it had filled far more seats than claimed by Ryanair, which itself did "not have one route 
making money out of Belfast".
Aer Lingus is taking action to reduce capacity, in particular on its long-haul routes to the US in the winter season, to 
reduce losses, and Mr Mannion said there could be more cuts. It is deferring some new aircraft deliveries from 
Airbus to try to slow planned capacity growth.

As union talks loom, the Irish airline is in need of a 'fundamental change', writes Kevin Done 
Body
Dermot Mannion, chief executive of Aer Lingus, has warned that the Irish airline must undertake "fundamental 
change" in order to minimise a "potential EUR100m [£82m] operating loss in 2009".
The airline is preparing another round of restructuring as it heads into two years of potentially heavy losses.
Mr Mannion says Aer Lingus cannot afford the traditional protracted negotiations with its trades unions.
It took about 18 months and several strike threats to negotiate the latest productivity improvements, aimed at saving 
EUR20m a year and implemented earlier this year.
The global airline industry is under heavy pressure from high oil prices and weakening demand and more than 25 
carriers have already collapsed this year. Most recently, Italy's Alitalia was put into administration last week, while 
Zoom Airlines, the Anglo-Canadian airline that was trying to develop low-cost long-haul services between London 
and the US, was forced to cease operations.
In an interview with the FT, Mr Mannion said that Aer Lingus intended to be one of the industry survivors thanks to a 
strong balance sheet with net cash of EUR803m at the end of June.
It was even planning substantial investment - placing new orders for more short-haul jets from 2010 and the 
establishment of its first operating bases in Britain or continental Europe.
But in the short term further changes were needed in the operating cost base to help ensure long-term viability.
"We will be coming with a new package of measures by the end of September," said Mr Mannion. "Everything is up 
for review. The challenge must be faced quickly.
Potential losses forcing cost cuts at Aer Lingus
"Fundamental change must happen. We must take out costs to reduce a potential EUR100m operating loss in 
2009."
He would give no details of planned cutbacks, but made a pointed comparison between the EUR80-a-seat it costs 
Aer Lingus to run a short-haul flight, with EUR60 at EasyJet and EUR40 at Ryanair, with the biggest differences 
being in labour and sales and distribution.
Last week Aer Lingus disclosed that in the first half of this year it had fallen to an operating loss of EUR22.3m from 
a profit of EUR2.6m in the same period last year, largely as a result of an increase of EUR56.5m, or 48.7 per cent, 
in fuel costs.
At best the airline expected to break even in the second half of the year - traditionally it makes the lion's share of its 
profits from July to September - implying a pre-tax loss for this year of more than EUR20m.
Weakened by its financial performance, Aer Lingus has been under heavy attack from Ryanair, ever since Europe's 
largest low-cost carrier failed in a takeover bid launched two years ago.
The takeover was blocked last year by the European Commission on competition grounds, a decision Ryanair is 
still fighting in the European courts.

Lingus is being marginalised on the sidelines of European aviation, losing money with no apparent strategy to

Since Aer Lingus was floated in September 2006 its share price has fallen 26 per cent - though Ryanair's 
performance in the same period has actually been worse, falling 32 per cent. In the past 12 months Aer Lingus has 
fallen 37 per cent and Ryanair 46 per cent. Ryanair, too, has warned it could fall into loss in its current financial 
year.
Mr Mannion dismissed Ryanair's attack on the performance of Aer Lingus's new operating base in Belfast, and said 
it had filled far more seats than claimed by Ryanair, which itself did "not have one route making money out of 
Belfast".
Aer Lingus is already taking action to reduce capacity on its long-haul routes to the US from the end of October to 
try to reduce losses. Mr Mannion said there could be more cuts to come.
The airline is also deferring some new aircraft deliveries from Airbus, as it seeks to slow its planned capacity 
growth.

Passenger numbers at Ryanair rose by 19pc in August compared to the same month last year but its load factor - 
how well it fills its aircraft - dropped slightly.
The no-frills airline carried nearly 5.8 million passengers and had just over 55 million passengers in the 12 months 
to the end of August, it said.
For the year to the end of August, its load factor held steady at 81pc but August's load factor dropped by 1pc to 
90pc when compared to the same month in 2007.
Stephen McNamara, Head of Communications, said: "Ryanair's latest passenger figures show that we continue to 
grow passenger numbers every month this year. Our rapidly growing passenger numbers come at a time when 
many airlines, which are facing huge losses, are raising fares and fuel surcharges in an attempt to turn these losses 
around. However, the reality is that this has driven their passengers to Ryanair. Now even more passengers realise 
that low fare, fuel surcharge free, travel is still possible - but only with Ryanair. We have carried over 55 million 
passengers in the last 12months, proving that passengers are increasingly attracted to Ryanair's guaranteed lowest 
fares and our promise of no fuel surcharges ever".

Low cost airline Ryanair grew passenger numbers in August by almost a fifth despite concerns over tightening 
consumer purse strings.
The group said it carried 5.8 million passengers in August, a 19% increase compared to the same month last year 
when it carried 4.84 million people.
Ryanair has grown passenger numbers every month this year, against a backdrop of a global credit crunch and 
concerns over the outlook for the UK consumer.
The only blip on the radar was a decline in load factors which were down 1%, with 90% of available seats being 
purchased compared to 91% last August.
However the group said this was down to an increase in capacity in the last 12 months.
Ryanair's head of communications, Stephen McNamara, said the figures showed the group was benefiting from 
increased cost pressures being felt at rival airlines.
He said: 'Our rapidly growing passenger numbers come at a time when many airlines, which are facing huge 
losses, are raising fares and fuel surcharges in an attempt to turn there losses around.
'However, the reality is that this has driven their passengers to Ryanair.'
Shares in Ryanair were down 3.81%or 0.105 at 2.65, at 10:24pm, in reaction to steeper oil prices.

European stocks sag on eurozone economic jitters
European stocks sag on eurozone economic jitters

European share prices retreated on Wednesday, ending at their lowest closing level in a week, as weak economic 
data for the euro zone fuelled fears of a recession in the region.
The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares closed 1.5 percent lower at 1,181.90 points.
Data showed that falling investment and private consumption led to the first ever quarterly contraction in the euro 
zone economy from April to June, while July retail sales and August services sentiment signalled more weakness 
ahead.
Tech and consumer-related shares lost ground, dragged down by worries over the euro zone outlook.
Nokia <NOK1V.HE> fell 4.6 percent, LVMH <LVMH.PA> lost 3.1 percent, Unilever <ULVR.L> dropped 3.4 percent 
and Danone <DANO.PA> shed 4.4 percent.
'The economic environment remains gloomy, especially in the euro zone where we're getting a flow of negative 
news. The euro zone is suffering more from the U.S. downturn than people had initially thought,' said Romain 
Boscher, head of equity management at Groupama Asset Management, in Paris.
'Economic indicators come in either in line with expectations -- but expectations are already for a recession -- or 
worse than forecast, like in the case of retail sales or investment levels.'
News of the demise of a hedge fund partly owned by Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers <LEH.N> rattled investors 
and weighed on banking shares.
BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> fell 1.3 percent, Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> shed 1.9 percent and Bank of Ireland 
<BKIR.I> lost 2.4 percent.
Airline stocks were among the biggest losers, surrendering some of their recent lofty gains sparked by the drop in 
oil prices.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Wednesday the global airline industry is set to post 
losses of $5.2 billion this year and $4.1 billion in 2009 as high oil prices take their toll.
British Airways <BAY.L> dropped 3.9 percent, Ryanair <RYA.I> fell 4.2 percent and Air France-KLM <AIRF.PA> 
shed 1 percent.
European stocks sag on eurozone economic jitters
Energy shares also got hit, falling along with crude oil prices. Repsol <REP.MC> fell 1.2 percent and Total 
<TOTF.PA> lost 2.3 percent.
Miners also took a beating, despite mixed metal prices. Rio Tinto <RIO.L> lost 4.7 percent and Anglo American 
<AAL.L> shed 3.3 percent.
Investors were also bracing themselves for interest rate decisions by both the Bank of England and the European 
Central Bank, due on Thursday.
Although the ECB is expected to keep the benchmark borrowing cost at 4.25 percent, the focus will be on remarks 
by President Jean-Claude Trichet that could give clues on the outlook for rates.
'We're expecting the status quo. Despite the recent sharp drop in commodity prices the central bank could remain 
very cautious, also because the recent fall in the euro versus the dollar is not helping the inflation outlook,' Boscher 
said.
The weak euro zone data released on Wednesday sent the euro currency <EUR=> sinking to a new eight-month 
low against the U.S. dollar.
'Conditions have undoubtedly worsened considerably in recent months,' BNP Paribas economists wrote in a note.
'Several factors undermined eurozone activity, including the deteriorating external environment, the strength of the 
euro, the surge in oil and food prices and last, but not least, the tightening of monetary and credit conditions.'
The FTSEurofirst 300 has lost 22 percent so far this year, hit by inflation and recession fears as well as by the 
impact of a crisis in the credit market on banks' balance sheets.

(ANSA) - Alghero, September 3 - The number of passengers welcomed by the Riviera del Corallo airport in 
Alghero-Fertilia, on the southern Italian island of Sardinia, increased by 13 pct on the year to 181,585 in August 
2008.
The rise in the number of passengers serviced by the airport rose thanks to the 37 pct growth in the number of 
passengers on domestic flights to 97,219. The passenger traffic on national flights grew thanks to the increase in 
passenger traffic on flights operated by Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair and Italian low-cost airline company Volare 
Web. The two low-cost air carriers transported 25 pct of passengers on national flights from and to the Riviera del 
Corallo airport.
Italian airlines AirOne, which manages the flights from Alghero to Rome, Milan, Turin and Bologna, registered 
59,471 passengers, up from 55,435 passengers. Ryanair transported a total 104,010 passengers to and from 
Alghero, up by 40 pct from 74,557 passengers.
The total aircraft movement at the airport increased by 4.0 pct to 1,676 from 1,616.
The passengers arriving at and departing from the Fertilia airport stood at 975,827 in the period January to August 
2008, up 12 pct from 871,278 passengers services in the first eight months of 2007, the airport managing company 
Sogeaal said.

European stock markets climbed yesterday as a steep drop in the price of oil eased inflation concerns, sending 
investors fleeing from commodities stocks into battered banks, construction companies and airlines.
The benchmark FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.9 per cent to 1,200.20. Germany's Xetra Dax rose 1.5 per cent to 
6,518.47. France's CAC 40 added 1.5 per cent to 4,539.07.
In the oil sector, Norway's StatoilHydro  lost 4.5 per cent to NKr153.10, while French Total  shed 1.2 per cent to 
EUR47.36, Italy's Eni  dropped 1.6 per cent to EUR21.58, in Austria OMV  slid 1.2 per cent to EUR42.20. Oilfield 
services group Saipem lost 4.6 per cent to EUR24.87.
Karen Olney, European equities strategist at Merrill Lynch, said the oil sector had outperformed the banking sector 
for the past two years and investors wanted to redistribute their assets. But the bounce would "end in 
disappointment" as banks would fail to generate double-digit returns.
Italy's Intesa San Paolo rose 4.5 per cent to EUR3.88 after Credit Suisse added it to its pan-European buy list.
Deutsche Bank  rose 2.9 per cent to EUR59.81, Switzerland's Credit Suisse  added 1.9 per cent to SFr52.40 and 
in France Crédit Agricole  advanced 4 per cent to EUR14.86. Bank of Ireland  climbed 4.8 per cent to EUR5.77.
Commerzbank  fell 1.3 per cent to EUR17.80 after UBS cut its price target from EUR22 a share to EUR19.50 a 
share
Housebuilders and construction companies did well. Spain's Sacyr Vallehermoso  rose 7.4 per cent to EUR13.81 
and French construction group Saint Gobain  added 5.5 per cent to EUR44. Irish cement maker CRH rose 6.2 per 
cent to EUR18.98.
Airline stocks flew higher with budget airline Ryanair leading the pack. The shares rose 8.7 per cent to EUR2.87, 
while Deutsche Lufthansa  gained 4.2 per cent to EUR15.63 and Air-France KLM  added 6.9 per cent to 
EUR18.20.
Banks and airlines back in favour
Automobiles advanced helped by a weaker euro. Daimler rose 4.9 per cent to EUR42.57, BMW  gained 3.4 per 
cent to EUR29.30, France's Peugeot rose 2.7 per cent to EUR34.53.

RYANAIR READY TO RENEW AER LINGUS FIGHT AS ECONOMIC PRESSURE GROWS ON EUROPE
Ryanair <RYA.I> is planning to revive an 800 million pound bid for Aer Lingus, after its original move was blocked 
by the European Commission amid fears that the combined group would dominate the Irish market. A Ryanair 
spokesman said: 'We are adopting a wait-and-see approach because there is a lot of consolidation (in European 
aviation) coming and that may force the EU to change its position.' Dermot Mannion, chief executive of Aer Lingus, 
said: 'The competitive landscape has not changed one bit since Ryanair made its first approach.'
PRIVATE EQUITY CONSORTIUM CLOSE TO SECURING FUNDS FOR THREE BILLION POUND INFORMA 
TAKEOVER
Private equity bidders including Providence Equity Partners and Carlyle Group are believed to be close to securing 
financing for a three billion pound acquisition of Informa <INF.L>, the events and exhibitions group. Sources close 
to the deal said the bidders had made excellent progress, although financing was not yet finalised. Analysts at UBS 
wrote in a note: 'This news is positive, as it appears the odds of a deal happening have increased sharply'. Shares 
in Informa closed 14.75 pence up at 440.5 pence on the speculation.
BP'S RUSSIAN VENTURE DENTS CREDIT RATING
Standard & Poor's lowered its corporate credit rating for BP <BP.L> on Monday, citing doubts over the long-term 
ownership of the oil giant's Russian joint venture TNK-BP. S&P cut its rate on BP's corporate debt from AA+ to AA, 
while lowering the long-term rating of BP Finance from AA to AA-. The ratings agency also cited BP's troubles in its 
refining businesses in the US, saying its reassessment reflected 'relative weaknesses that extend beyond the major 
issues at its two largest refineries [in the US]'.
The Daily Telegraph
PEOPLE'S BANK POWERS INTO BRITAIN
The People's Bank of China has built a secret stake in Drax <DRX.L>, the owner of Britain's biggest coal-fired 
power station. In a further demonstration of the extent to which China is deploying its vast foreign exchange 
holdings in overseas markets, the bank is understood to have been building its stake in Drax for over a year and it 
PRESS DIGEST - British Business Press - Sept 2
now owns just over 0.7 percent of the company. A spokesman for Drax said the company was aware of the 
investment. 'We welcome all long-term shareholders,' he said.
LOGISTICS FIRM GOES INTO ADMINISTRATION
The logistics company Business Direct has been put into administration and on Monday its shares were suspended 
from trading. The company's board announced in a statement late on Friday that it had 'taken advice and concluded 
that the company is no longer in a position to continue its operations'.
GDF SUEZ RULES OUT BE BID, BUT STILL SEEKS NUCLEAR OPTION
The French utility giant GDF Suez <LYOE.PA> has ruled out a bid for British Energy <BGY.L>, but declared its 
interest in the UK nuclear energy market generally. Unveiling the company's interim results on Monday, chairman 
and chief executive Gerard Mestrallet said: 'On British Energy, we are not interested in acquiring the company and 
have stopped all talks.' Mestrallet has previously signalled that GDF Suez is keen on building and running nuclear 
generators in the UK and confirmed on Monday an interest in the British nuclear sector more broadly.

LSE OFFERS INCENTIVES TO BEAT TRADING RIVALS
The London Stock Exchange has redoubled its efforts to fend off rival share trading platforms by launching a new 
system offering traders incentives and lower charges. Three rivals are launching in the coming months offering 
trading in pan-European equities, with Nasdaq OMX Europe and BATS expected to open this autumn. The 
incoming competitor quickest off the block has been Turquoise, which opened for its first full week of operation on 
Monday and is reported to be confident of taking a five percent market share by Christmas.
TNS STILL OPPOSED TO WPP TAKEOVER BID
Taylor Nelson Sofres <TNS.L>, the market research firm, has restated its opposition to a proposed 1.2 billion pound 
takeover by advertising giant WPP <WPP.L>. Sir Martin Sorrell's firm, the only remaining suitor after its rival 
withdrew last week, said it was extending its offer to 12 September and had secured acceptances from 8.6 percent 
of the TNS shareholders. But TNS again urged shareholders to snub the bid, describing the acceptance level as 
'low'.
COORS BREWERS RAISES BEER PRICES FOR SECOND TIME THIS YEAR
Coors Brewers, the UK's second-largest brewer, has become the latest to raise its beer prices in an effort to claw 
back soaring input costs. An earlier four pence a pint uplift for on-trade in February has now been followed with a 
three pence a pint hike effective from 29 September. Chief executive of Coors, Mark Hunter, said: 'We are seeing 
input cost inflation of a magnitude that could cripple the UK beer industry.'

B&B SALES CHIEF QUITS AS CREDIT RATING IS DOWNGRADED
Mark Stevens, sales director at Bradford & Bingley <BB.L>, quit the ailing lender on Monday to become the first 
board member to part company with the buy-to-let specialist since the arrival of new chief executive Richard Pym 
two weeks ago. The news came as Fitch, the credit ratings agency, said the outlook for B&B was negative and 
downgraded its rating to BBB+. 'The weaker revenues driven by narrowing interest spreads and a shrinking loan 
book coincided with worsening bad debts,' said Fitch.
RWE SPENDS SIX MILLION POUNDS ON STAKE IN QUIET REVOLUTION
Quiet Revolution, the British wind turbine maker, is selling a six million pound minority stake to RWE <RWEG.DE>, 
the German company that owns npower. Robert Webb, chief executive of the UK company, said: 'We are delighted 
PRESS DIGEST - British Business Press - Sept 2
to be working with [RWE subsidiary] RWE Innogy to deliver efficient local wind energy.' Fritz Varenholt, the head of 
Innogy, said: 'The local supply of electric power to individual buildings from renewable energy will become 
increasingly significant'.
M&S GRILLS WHISTLEBLOWER FOR THREE HOURS
Marks & Spencer <MKS.L> held a three-hour disciplinary hearing on Monday for an employee who blew the whistle 
on plans to cut redundancy pay for the company's staff. The man was represented by the GMB union, which said it 
was expecting a decision on what action he would face in the next few days. M&S told staff last month it was 
planning to reduce redundancy payments and the employee, based at the group's London head office, leaked the 
news to the media. M&S refused to comment, saying it was an internal matter. The employee was suspended from 
his duties pending the disciplinary hearing.

Shares in Bulgari <BULG.MI> rise more than 4 percent to 7.36 euros, close to a three-month high, after Morgan

Ryanair today said that it is winning its battle against what it labels 'ticket tout' screenscraper Websites.
It added that the EU Commission said it had ended a probe into the carrier over the conflict.
Last month, the airline began cancelling and reimbursing around 450 bookings a day made by online ticket agents 
known as screen scrapers who were selling the tickets to passengers at inflated prices.
The company also said screen scrapers were slowing its website, preventing its usual customers from making 
bookings, and violating its terms and conditions, price guarantees and copyright. Media reports said many 
passengers were angry after missing holidays as a result, and the European Commission wrote to Ryanair seeking 
information on whether the airline was breaking laws on passenger rights. The EU Commission told Reuters today 
that it had ended its probe. 'Yes, that is the end of the matter for now,' a Commission spokesman said. 'The 
Commission has received no actual complaints from passengers ... but of course we have reiterated our warning to 
Ryanair.''If a passenger is denied boarding, the regulation on passenger rights would apply -- passengers would be 
entitled to reimbursement and assistance.' A Ryanair spokesman also said he had heard no reports of passengers 
being denied boarding at any airports and it seemed the message was getting through to screen-scraping websites. 
'At the start of August we were cancelling around 450 tickets a day booked by screen scrapers,' he added. 'Last 
week, it was down to 60 to 70 a day.' Last week, Ryanair said a German court had upheld an injunction against 
ticketing website Vtours.de, which was previously selling Ryanair tickets. The airline said in August that Irish screen 
scraper BravoFly Ltd had agreed to stop using Ryanair's website after the airline took legal action.

Air scares
Posted 26 August
by David Learmount
So Qantas had a sudden decompression a few weeks ago, and now a Ryanair Boeing 737-800 has just suffered 
one.
Sudden decompression is one of the two types of event that can occur on any passenger flight that are certain to 
scare the hell out of almost anybody on board, even though they normally contain little or no risk to life and limb.
The other frightening event is an unexpected go-around late on final approach to land. The terror factor in these 
events is a result of their sheer suddenness, and the fact they are totally unexpected (even by the crew), and both 
these types of incident make the pilots so busy for several minutes that they cannot safely take the time to explain 
what has happened and reassure the passengers there is no risk.

The in-flight porn debate
Posted 26 August
by Mary Kirby
The old in-flight porn debate has reared its big ugly head. With a slew of US majors bringing WiFi connectivity on 
board their aircraft, the question of whether they should regulate content is now splattered across the news.
American Airlines, which recently became the first US carrier to offer broadband, has opted to provide unfiltered 
internet access to passengers. In the event that someone complains about their neighbour's decision to view 
explicit content, then it will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis by the sky police, aka flight attendants.
Bumpy flights and racy mags INTRODUCTION:
A number of other international operators are said to be planning the same strategy. But is this something we 
should really be concerned about? Haven't blokes been bringing racy magazines on board aircraft for eons? And 
haven't they been generally pretty discreet about it?

A media roundtable in the Pentagon yesterday about the C-130 lasted an hour, but there was so much information 
we could have used two or three hours. Not bad for a 55-year-old production line!
The US Air Force has bought 89 C-130Js and it is now approved to buy at least another 83. Negotiations for a 
multi-year procurement contract began last week with Lockheed Martin.
The C-130J is also a leading contender to replace the 115-aircraft HC/MC-130 fleet. An acquisition strategy is being 
developed for approval in September 2009. A mixed fleet of C-130Js and rewinged C-130Es, possibly via Snow 
Aviation, is under consideration. Of course, Lockheed already has a contract to supply 14 modified KC-130J 
tankers to replace the oldest HC-130s, but this does not oblige the USAF to purchase an all J fleet.

cessna's mustang in action

On the second day of Oskhosh, I had the opportunity to see the Cessna Mustang in action. The Mustang is 
Cessna's entry into the very light jet market, competing with aircraft like Embraer's Phenom 100 and the Eclipse 
500.
Along with my colleague Phil Nasskau from Flight Daily News (who was flying right seat) and Cessna's Curt Epp 
(left seat) we took the Mustang out for a quick spin. Here's the video (in four parts) of our hour-long hop from 
Appleton up to Iron Mountain and back at 30,000ft in N946CM.
A very special thanks to Cessna for inviting us along for the demonstration!

Southwest's scalpel
Posted 27 August
by David Field
Southwest has finally published its winter schedules, starting 11 January, and it's taking about 6% out of the system 
- the deepest cuts in a long time, although the company says it may add some flights back in March.
Southwest had for a long time aimed at growth in the 8-10% annual range, but it has slowed that rate to just 4% in 
2008 and may be flat for 2009. In all, the new schedule will cut 196 flights system-wide and add six.
Bumpy flights and racy mags INTRODUCTION:
That's still a softer swipe than other carriers are taking to their schedules, such as United's 16% cut or American's 
12%, and you really can't find a pattern except that some very early and very late flights will end, according to 
scheduling manager Bill Owen.

(ANSA) - Turin, September 2 - Irish low-cost air carrier Ryanair will launch on December 20, 2008 six flights from 
the Caselle airport in Turin, northern Italy.
The new flights will connect Turin and Shannon in western Ireland and the UK airports Pretwick in Glasgow, East-
Midlands in Nottingham, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Bournemouth.
After the launch of the new air connections, the number of the flights operated by Ryanair from the Caselle airport 
will increase to 11.
The information was presented in advance by Ryanair deputy marketing director for Italy, Giovanna Gentile, in 
Milan, northern Italy.
Besides the flight to be launched in December from Caselle, the Irish air carrier currently operates a flight from 
Turin to Stansted airport in London and will start a flight to Girona airport in Barcelona, northeastern Spain, on 
October 28, 2008. Ryanair will start also flights from Turin to Bristol, the UK, Brussels South Charleroi Airport and 
Dublin, Gentile added.
Ryanair expects to transport 14 million passengers in Italy in 2008, ANSA wrote on May 7, 2008. In 2007, Ryanair 
transported a total 12.7 million passengers and in the period between 1998 and 2007 it carried 60 million 
passengers in Italy. The Italian market is the second largest for the company, generating a total 12 pct of the 
passenger traffic of Ryaniar.

Aer Lingus losses revive Ryanair merger rhetoric
Aer Lingus losses revive Ryanair merger rhetoric

Ryanair <RYA.I> said on Monday that its earlier plans to create a single Irish airline group looked justified after rival 
Aer Lingus <AERL.I> announced last week it would be loss-making into 2009.
Ryanair <RYA.L>, whose bid for Aer Lingus was blocked last year by the European Commission on competition 
grounds, has often complained that in the current wave of European airline mergers it should be allowed to buy the 
former state carrier.
'These half year results from Aer Lingus conclusively supports Ryanair's belief that its 2006 takeover strategy for 
Aer Lingus was the right one,' Ryanair spokesman Stephen McNamara said in a statement on Monday.
Ryanair had promised to reduce Aer Lingus's fares, scrap its fuel surcharges and reduce its costs, he added.
Aer Lingus posted a half-year loss on Thursday hit by record high fuel prices and slowed markets, adding that it 
needed a major cost-cutting programme to remain viable.
Chief Executive Dermot Mannion denied, however, that it had become more vulnerable to a takeover, arguing that it 
was still in a better position than most European short-haul carriers.
Many analysts agree that it has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry with more than 800 million euros 
in cash.
Ryanair, which holds more than 29 percent of Aer Lingus shares and nearly three times more cash than its rival, 
said Aer Lingus' 'independence strategy' had failed.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, has said it could also make a small loss this year for the first time since 
1989 as it cuts fares to snatch business from struggling rivals.
'Approximately 25 carriers have failed this year, as fuel costs rose to record highs,' said John Goode, analyst at 
Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin.
'As we leave the summer period behind, and the seasonally high cashflows for airlines that come with it, this list is 
likely to be extended.'
Last week alone, Canadian discount transatlantic carrier Zoom Airlines cancelled all flights and began bankruptcy 
proceedings on Thursday, while Italian national airline Alitalia <AZPIa.MI> sought bankruptcy protection on Friday.

The British Airport Authority (BAA) has begun legal action in the High Court of England and Wales to force Ryanair 
to pay a 15% increase in landing charges at London's Stansted Airport. BAA raised the landing fees on April 1, 
since when, it is alleged, Ryanair has refused to pay, claiming the increase was excessive and an abuse of BAA's 
dominant position in the market. BAA owns Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, has also announced plans to decrease winter air traffic through 
Stansted, its main hub, because of increased fuel prices and the airport's high landing fees.
BAA claims the fee hike is reasonable and within the limits allowed by the Civil Aviation Authority. Spanish company 
Ferrovial owns BAA.

Section: THE MARKET
Length: 1036 words
Body
After battling through a series of stiff challenges, Dermot Mannion is on the back foot once more.
The markets think of your company as little more than an EUR 800 million bank ac count with a troublesome, 
valueless airline attached. Your fuel bills and losses are soaring.
Customers are running out of spending power and cutting back on foreign travel. Meanwhile, unhelpful trade unions 
are lacing up the gloves for yet another row over reform of outdated work practices. Welcome to the good-news-
free world that Dermot Mannion inhabits.
The Aer Lingus chief executive could be forgiven for exuding some world-weariness, after reporting half-year losses 
of EUR 20 million and warning that the bottom line could be EUR 100 million underwater by the end of next year.
Yet Mannion soldiers on. The latest challenges he faces - rocketing oil prices, an economic slowdown in the 
airline's main markets and aggressive price-cutting from rivals - are scant reward for all the hurdles he has cleared 
since taking the top job three years ago.
Despite all the progress in defeating Ryanair's 2006 takeover bid: setting up a new base in Belfast and 
controversially axing the Shannon-Heathrow route; and implementing - albeit slowly - an equally controversial EUR 
20million cost-cutting programme, last week saw him effectively go back to square one. Once again, he faces a 
struggle to run the business like a true publicly-quoted company.
The latest crunch tackle arrives courtesy of the commodities markets, which will push up Mannion's annual fuel bill 
from EUR 253 million last year to EUR 390 million this year and - according to Aer Lingus estimates - EUR 463 
million in 2009.
The EUR 140 million surge between 2007 and 2008 easily outpunches the EUR 90 million operating profit delivered 
last year. Higher oil prices will also result in a breakeven performance - at best - for Aer Lingus in the second half of 
the year, the period in which it usually makes the bulk of its profits.
Aer Lingus feels the squeeze
The fuel bill hike also puts into context the EUR 20 million cost saving achieved after months of difficult negotiations 
with unions. Even though the savings themselves are worthwhile, the benefits of all that hard work lose their 
significance when the bottom line is under such heavy assault from other quarters.
Mannion had little choice last week but to pledge further action on the costs front. He spoke of the need for ''a 
fundamental root-and-branch reappraisal of where we are on costs''.
Given the excruciating difficulty in rustling up cuts of just EUR 20 million over the past year, it is unlikely that the 
airline has it within itself to achieve the even greater savings that are necessary in response to the latest squeeze.
In Mannion's defence, he has at least hired the right man to oversee the job. Chief financial officer Sean Coyle, the 
former head of revenue at Ryanair, delivered an unequivocal message last week on the importance of getting Aer 
Lingus's house in order through ''a fundamental overhaul of the cost base''.
Coyle's arrival offers hope that a Michael O'Leary-trained eye will be focused on the areas in greatest need of 
change, and that lip-service on costs will give way to effective action. Just like Mannion before him, however, Coyle 
is about to discover the joys of moving from the no-nonsense commercial world to the twilight zone, somewhere 
between semi-state slumber and the stock market, in which Aer Lingus operates.
The early signs are not encouraging. Aer Lingus unions, predictably, l aid the ground for dissatisfaction with fresh 
cost-cutting. Mannion's task will also be complicated by the EUR 800 million in cash at his disposal.
Although he paraded the cash pile earlier this year as an asset that was the envy of other airlines, and one which 
would act as a welcome buffer in the event of an industry downturn, it will also undermine his attempts to sound a 
note of urgency and encourage staff to take some pain for the greater good.
While Mannion's predecessor Willie Walsh could plausibly argue in the past that the airline would collapse if staff 
did not agree to job losses and other cost savings, the cash injection provided by the flotation makes it difficult for 
the current boss to argue that the wolf is at the door.
Mannion said that dipping into cash reserves to cover operating losses was ''not an acceptable proposition for 
shareholders'' and that staff and the Employee Share Ownership Trust (Esot), which between them hold 15 per cent 
of the airline, would suffer with their fellow shareholders, in the absence of further reforms. This is an argument he 
would do well to win.
Mannion has already scored an own goal by allowing staff numbers to grow by 4 per cent last year. He may justify 
the increase in numbers on the grounds that the airline was expanding and needed more people to serve more 
routes and passengers, but it makes little sense to hire when it is quickly becoming clear that excess staff, already 
on the payroll, will need to be redeployed or offloaded in the near future.
As another battle to convince staff and unions of the merits of his strategy gets under way, the battle to convince 
the markets appears to be a losing one. At last week's share price, Aer Lingus is now valued at just EUR 800 
million - almost exactly the same as its net cash balance and less than half its price tag when the stock was riding 
at its highest.
If a buyer could persuade Aer Lingus's shareholders to cash in their chips at the current price, it would recoup its 
outlay in full immediately simply by gaining control of the airline's cash. It could then have an airline business and 
lucrative slots at Heathrow (valued at up to EUR 750 million) for free.
It is two years since Mannion urged shareholders to reject the EUR 2.80 per share on offer from Ryanair, saying he 
could deliver them better value over the medium and long term as a stand-alone entity. With Aer Lingus shares 
trading at EUR 1.50 last week, hopes for a return to that level appear misplaced.
Instead, shareholders can look forward to a lengthy diet of bad news on oil prices, faltering passenger demand and 
union unrest. In his quieter moments, Mannion may conclude that perhaps the Ryanair offer didn't look so bad after 
all.

Taoiseach aiming to restart partnership talks

Taoiseach Brian Cowen is expected formally to invite unions and employers to talks this week to kickstart a process 
which will aim to bring the national pay talks to a conclusion during September.
Government officials have held separate behind-the-scenes meetings with key officials from the Irish Congress of 
Trade Unions and employers' group Ibec over the past week. Talks are due to move into a new phase to determine 
whether both sides can agree to a deal.
The initial focus will be on establishing whether the two sides are still interested in an agreement to bridge the gaps 
on key issues and extend the current national pay deal, which expires shortly.
When the discussions broke up at the end of last month, employers were offering a 5 per cent pay rise over 21 
months, with a six-month pay pause in the private sector, an 11-month pause in the public sector and a 12month 
freeze in construction.
Cowen's decision not to intervene to avoid the breakdown of the talks led to criticism by some trade union leaders. 
However others, including Peter McLoone of Impact, said that Cowen had ''made the right call''.
The unions have already accepted that below-inflation pay rises are inevitable, but they are seeking specific 
provisions for the lower paid. Ibec may be required to improve its offer slightly, and the unions may demand a 
shortening of the agreement to narrow the gap with inflation.
A shortening of the proposed pay pauses is also likely in any settlement proposals which emerge. Differences also 
exist on the latitude of employers to declare an inability to pay employees in difficult trading conditions.
Employers want a less bureaucratic mechanism which takes account of current or anticipated difficulties, rather 
than just past conditions. Unions may accept a broadening of the terms, but only in the context of some level of 
certainty for increases.
Taoiseach aiming to restart partnership talks
The non-pay issues, such as defining collective bargaining - in the wake of a Supreme Court judgment in a case 
involving Ryanair - and issues around agency workers, would be put into a separate process to be resolved within a 
particular time.
A major government anti-inflation campaign is also expected to be proposed by the Taoiseach and his ministers. 
This could include a specific target to be reached in terms of inflation reduction. The move by the government to try 
to rescue social partnership comes amid further economic gloom, rising unemployment and fears that the number 
of new houses being built has taken a significant dip.

Going back to school or college these days is an increasingly internet centred experience.
Between extensive online study resources and keeping up with friends' Bebo sites, having one's own laptop is a 
common request for teens and young adults. To fulfil this request is not a daunting financial commitment these 
days:  500 is more than enough.
For that, you can expect a machine that is fully internet-ready, fast enough to handle most applications easily and 
capable of enough storage for several terms' work as well as a sizeable collection of music, photos and films. Here 
are four laptops that should fit the bill.
Dell Inspiron 1525 If you're looking for a fully-featured 15inc h laptop for under  500,Dell's Inspiron has to be a 
leading contender. Being a 15-inch machine, it is considerably more powerful and functional than its mini-laptop 
cousins.
That superior specification starts with a DVD re-writer,1.7 dual core Intel processor, 2GB of Ram and 160GB hard 
drive. But that's just the beginning. A whopping four USB 2.0 ports will let the multimedia-savvy student plug in a 
whole range of accessories simultaneously, while dual microphone jacks will allow him or her to share some music-
listening, should they make a new 'special friend'.
It also has an HDMI-out port, if you want to use it to play (regular) DVDs on your HD television. Finally, it comes 
with the option of different case colours ( 40 extra from the standard black or white). Windows Vista comes as 
standard.  500 including delivery (price includes colour option)
Fujitsu Siemens Amilo Li 2727 For those looking for a Ryanair laptop (gets the job done efficiently with few frills at a 
budget price), this Fujitsu Siemens model is a good choice. It is not particularly light (2.7kg), or especially powerful. 
But it is as good an internet/word processing computer as you'll find for under  500.

With 1GB of Ram, a 2Ghz (single core) processor, a 120GB hard drive and a DVD burner, it does all the basics 
well. With four USB 2.0 ports, it also gives a lot of flexibility for adding external devices to help give the machine 
more oomph, should it be needed. One nice extra feature is its silent mode, which reduces the noise of the fan, by 
clocking down the laptop's processor and graphics card.  400 from The Carphone Warehouse
Medion Mini Netbook For some, shopping for a laptop in Aldi may be a step too far into recessionary behaviour. 
Still, there's nothing to sniff at with the chain's decently specced 10-inch 'Netbook' computer. In terms of 
performance, it just about holds its own against more expensive rivals.
It has an 80GB hard drive, 1GB of Ram and 1.6Ghz processor. Where it differs from some competitors is in its 
smaller 10-inch screen, which brings the overall weight down to a very light 1.2kg. In this, it skirts the mini-laptop 
category, currently all the rage. The laptop also has two USB ports, a webcam, Windows XP and a memory card 
reader, though no Bluetooth is included, nor is a DVD/CD player.  400, available from September 7th in Aldi Stores
HP Mini-Note 2133 Chasing the new mini-laptop market (pioneered by Asus' EEE PC), HP has introduced a 
durable, attractive machine that also runs on Linux and comes with Bluetooth and a generous 120GB hard drive.
It has a nine inch screen and weighs a portable 1.27kg. Like all mini-laptops, this machine has no CD or DVD 
player, so an external drive will be needed to play movies or load on extra software. It also has a fairly modest 
1.2GhzVia processor, probably based on the assumption that this is powerful enough to run a Linux machine whose 
main purpose is internet browsing, e-mailing and word processing. This machine costs a bit more than some of its 
student laptop rivals, but comes with a good computing pedigree.  450- 650, depending on stockist and operating 
system choice
Advice when looking for a student laptop
Storage memory The traditional rule of built-in hard drive storage is that bigger is better: 120GB lets you store a 
huge collection of music, photos and a few movies, while 80GB might limit you to 'only' a few thousand songs and a 
few thousand pictures. However, this rule is changing.
USB memory sticks, SD memory cards and external hard drives are becoming bigger and cheaper, so look for a 
laptop that has as many USB 2.0 ports as possible and which also has a card-reader. An 8GB USB memory stick, 
for example, costs about  25.
Realising this, some mini-laptops have a feature known as solid state hard drives, which are memory capsules with 
no moving parts (unlike a hard drive). Although they offer far smaller capacities (4GB, for example) than their hard 
drive rivals, they make up for it by using far less energy, extending the laptop's battery life to as much as seven 
hours on a full charge.
Linux vs Microsoft Lots of student models now have a Linux operating system as a cheaper option to Microsoft 
Windows. Although this means you will not be able to use programs such as Microsoft Word, most Linux systems 
are quite user-friendly and work largely in the same way as Windows.
Using Linux does, in some instances, limit applications that can be used on a laptop. However, it is generally amore 
secure system, with spyware and other viruses being less common on the platform.
Size and weight The standard size for production laptops is 15i nches. Anything smaller or bigger attracts a 
premium. This is why 9-inch or 10-inch laptops, although they are less powerful and have fewer features than 15-
inch models, usually cost more.
But no matter how many albums, movies and photos a 15inch laptop can hold, lugging it around can be a pain.
This is where mini-laptops are coming into their own, weighing in at about 1kg (as opposed to a 2.5kg full-sized 
laptop). Bear in mind that smaller laptops often do not come with DVD players, and have fewer ports for 
accessories.

TWO MORE COMPANIES JOIN TAX DEFECTION
British companies Charter <CHTR.L> and Henderson Group <HGI.L> have announced that they are going to move 
their headquarters to Ireland in order to cut their tax and compliance costs. The move has been seen by some as 
significantly increasing the pressure on the Treasury to keep the tax system competitive. Henderson also warned 
that other companies could follow suit. Another four British companies have transferred to Ireland in the last five 
months, highlighting corporate dissatisfaction with the tax system. Heather Self, of professional services group 
Grant Thornton, said: 'There is concern it is at a tipping point'.
PRICE OF HOMES FALLS FOR TENTH MONTH
A new report by Nationwide has revealed that house prices fell for the tenth consecutive month in August, posting 
their largest year-on-year fall in 18 years. The survey found that the price of a typical house has fallen 1.9 percent in 
the month, taking the annual fall to 10.5 percent, the first time that the annual decline in prices has entered into 
double digits since nationwide started collecting data in 1991. Meanwhile, a new survey by the CBI has revealed 
that retailers believe their sales are lower than a year ago, and that many organisations are beginning to cut jobs in 
preparation for tougher times.
REGULATOR REBUKES MOBILE COMPANIES OVER COMPLAINTS
Ofcom has criticised mobile phone operators for having too many dissatisfied customers and offering inadequate 
network coverage. New figures released by the telecoms regulator show that mobile phones are the second most 
complained about product in the economy, with an estimated 1.4 million dissatisfied customers. Ofcom went on to 
highlight an increase in complaints about mis-selling and incorrect billing, along with so-called 'not-spots', areas 
where there is no mobile phone coverage. 'The mobile sector is at a point of change. We need regulation to adapt', 
said Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards.
RYANAIR AND EASYJET FACE THREAT OF NEW ARRIVAL
Thomas Cook <TCG.L> has revealed that it has opened discussions with Tui Travel <TT.L> and Lufthansa 
<LHAG.DE> about a possible merger of their low-cost and charter carriers, a move which, if successful, would see 
a new rival to Ryanair <RYA.I> and EasyJet <EZJ.L> emerge. Tui and Lufthansa have been investigating merger 
options for the last few months in an attempt to rid their balance sheets of non-core aviation assets. News of the 
PRESS DIGEST - Financial Times - August 29
talks comes at a time when soaring fuel costs and worsening economic conditions have forced over 25 airlines 
around the world into bankruptcy.
DIAGEO BRANDS PROVE RESILIENT
Diageo <DGE.L> chief executive Paul Walsh has said that he remains optimistic that sales of the group's whiskies 
and vodkas will remain robust despite the faltering global economy and political turmoil in Russia. Shares in the 
company increased by 20.5 pence to ten pounds at the end of trading on Thursday after Mr Walsh reported a nine 
percent rise in operating profits to 2.3 billion pounds. Diageo also said that despite the credit crunch, it has 
managed to increase the prices it charges for most of its brand, helping lift its US profits by 10 percent and its 
overall sales revenues by five per cent.
STAGECOACH BENEFITS IN SWITCH FROM CAR TO PUBLIC TRANSPORT
Bus and rail company Stagecoach <SGC.L> reported strong trading in the first quarter of its financial year as more 
people moved from private cars to public transport. In its trading update, the company said that in the 16 weeks to 
August 17 its profits grew more quickly than expected thanks to revenue growth in its bus division. Revenue growth 
in the bus business was 9.3 percent, while takings at its US bus operations went up by 7.6 percent.
RETAILERS DEMAND RENTAL FLEXIBILITY
A letter sent to landlords by Sir Philip Green, the owner of BHS and Arcadia, has called for an 'open and honest 
conversation' on the 'archaic' leasing and rent review structure which exists in the United Kingdom. In his letter, Sir 
Philip claims to have the support of 33 fellow retailers, indicating that many are thinking about paying landlords 
monthly rather than quarterly, and want to take on rents without prior agreement. Landlords have previously agreed 
to shift to easier terms when retailers are in danger of running short of cash, but many retailers do not believe that 
the move went far enough.
FALL IN PROPERTY SALES HURTS SAVILLS
The property consultancy Savills <SVS.L> has reported a 41 percent fall in underlying profits to 19.2 million pounds 
due to the decline of the commercial and residential real estate markets. The organisation has stated that it is still 
on track to make 20 million pounds' worth of cost savings in 2008, partly through redundancies. The residential 
market has seen a decline of 45 percent in the past year in London and house prices are predicted to fall by 25 per 
cent between 2008 and 2010.
UPBEAT AMEC IS TAPPING THE BENEFITS OF RESTRUCTURING
Amec <AMEC.L>, the engineering services company, has reported that booming demand in oil and gas, mining and 
power generation has helped the company lift profits by one third. Samir Brikho, the group's chief executive, has 
raised the company's margin target for 2010 from eight percent to 8.5 percent. The group has been reaping the 
rewards of Mr Brikho's restructuring of the organisation since 2006, after he divested the group of its UK-focused 
construction and infrastructure businesses and moved focus towards high-growth energy and power industries.
CARILLION BULLISH ON GUIDANCE AS PRE-TAX PROFITS GROW
Unveiling a rise in profits and issuing bullish guidance for the year ahead, the construction company Carillion 
<CLLN.L> has reported that its move towards the support services sector appears to be paying off. Its recent 555 
million pound acquisition of Alfred McAlpine <MCA.L> means that less than one-fifth of its profits now comes from 
its construction arm. Chief executive John McDonough said the growth in importance of the support services arm 
would provide added resilience for the company. Overall pre-tax profits for the company rose to 19 million pounds in 
the first half, largely in line with previous guidance.

said yesterday that Ryanair, which has now axed these two routes, was turning a huge profit by charging 
consumers for fantasy costs. A statement from the airline said: "In most cases passengers travelling from Cork will

A passenger jet of Irish budget airline Ryanair made an emergency landing in Rome Friday after an apparent 
malfunctioning of its main landing wheel, airport agency Telenews said.
The plane which carried 160 people on board was on a flight from the northern Italian city of Bergamo and due to 
land at Rome's Ciampino airport.
But the pilot re-routed it to the city's main Fiumicino airport because it was closer after receiving a signal about an 
undercarriage problem.
Security services were on stand-by but the Boeing 737 landed normally. No one was hurt in the incident.
On Monday a Ryanair jet plunged 8,000 metres (26,250 feet) in five minutes and a number of passengers were 
taken to hospital after the aircraft made an emergency landing in the central French city of Limoges.
The Boeing 737 was carrying 168 passengers and seven crew from Bristol in England to Barcelona when it suffered 
what police described a brutal decompression.

Thomas Cook talks to Tui and Lufthansa
Groups eye merger of airline units
Body
Thomas Cook, the tour operator, is in discussions with rival Tui Travel and the airline Lufthansa about a possible 
merger of their respective low-cost and charter carriers, a move that would create a new rival for Ryanair, EasyJet 
and Air Berlin.
In the latest example of how record fuel costs are forcing a restructuring of Europe's aviation industry, the three 
German-controlled companies said they were in talks about joining Condor, Tuifly and Germanwings.
Tui and Lufthansa have for months been looking at various merger options to rid their balance sheets of non-core 
aviation assets. Thomas Cook joined the talks after Air Berlin last month scrapped plans to buy Condor, blaming 
deteriorating economic conditions.
News of the talks comes as airlines are facing a big increase in fuel costs and a worsening economic outlook. More 
than 25 carriers around the world have collapsed into bankruptcy, and many are seeking cost-cuts through mergers 
or a reduction in capacity.
A Condor-Tuifly-Germanwings tie-up would create a mixed charter and low-cost carrier akin to Air Berlin, the largest 
discount carrier in Europe after Ryanair and EasyJet.
Although the three companies said talks were at an early stage and there could be no certainty of a deal, Alex 
Paterson, an analyst at Liberum Capital, said if successful, a merger would be "excellent news" for the tour 
operators.
"[It would remove] excess capacity from the short-haul market and reducing significant cost duplication that should 
provide incremental savings over and above those announced in the merger of Thomas Cook and MyTravel and 
Tui and First Choice," he said.
Ryanair and EasyJet face threat of new rival
But, like other analysts, Mr Paterson said a tie-up would probably attract lengthy regulatory scrutiny, given that Tui 
and Thomas Cook are Europe's biggest travel groups and Germanwings is run by the biggest airline in Germany.
Soundings from Germany's cartel watchdog may have contributed to the collapse of the Air Berlin-Condor deal.
Shares in Thomas Cook rose 3.5 per cent to 222½p. The company is majority owned by Germany's Arcandor. Tui 
Travel, controlled by Germany's Tui AG, gained 2.5 per cent to 209p.

Germany's Lufthansa took the next steps on its mission to become one of Europe's dominant scheduled carriers 
yesterday by pitching to take over Brussels Airlines and putting its low-cost   carrier Germanwings up for a three-
way merger.
The airline said it was in talks to buy 45 per cent of Brussels Airlines for EUR65m ($95.7m) and take an option to 
buy the remaining 55 per cent in 2010.
Lufthansa had already flagged its intention to make the most of the oil shock hurting the global airline industry by 
trying to pick up bargains. It said the Brussels-based operation would bring new routes in Europe "and in particular 
to Africa".
Lufthansa, Air France/KLM and British Airways are all jostling for position in the huge - but still fragmented - 
European market. The German and French rivals are considered favourites to take a dominant stake in Austrian 
Airways, which the Austrian government wants to sell.
Lufthansa also announced that it and German-controlled travel groups Thomas Cook and Tuiwere discussing 
merging theirlow-cost and charter carriers, Germanwings, Condor and Tuifly, in an attempt to shed non-core assets.
The trio of German companies has been looking at merger options for some time in efforts to rid their balance 
sheets of non-core aviation assets and reduce their exposure to the charter and low-cost sectors they no longer 
like.
Airlines worldwide have been hit by high fuel prices and many are seeking to cut costs through mergers.
A Condor-Tuifly-Germanwings tie up would create a mixed charter and low-cost carrier akin to Air Berlin, the third-
largest discount carrier in Europe after the UK's Easyjet and Ireland's Ryanair.
The announcements came as an added blow to Air   Berlin, which reported that fuel costs lowered earnings before 
interest and taxes by a quarter year on year in the second quarter.
Lufthansa gears up European expansion strategy
The carrier has been hit by record fuel prices. As jitters about its prospects grew - and murmurs from Germany's 
cartel watchdog - Thomas Cook walked away from a deal to merge Condor, its charter airline, with Air Berlin in July.
Joachim Hunold, Air Berlin's chief executive, said authorities would have "big doubts" about the proposed three-way 
deal - Tui and Thomas Cook are Germany's biggest travel groups and Germanwings is run by its biggest airline. He 
said consolidation would "not change much" for Air Berlin and again pledged that his airline would make a small 
operating profit in 2008.
Over the summer, Air Berlin said it would suspend services to China and New York and cut its European timetable 
this winter. Mr Hunold gave no sign when these services would resume.

A Ryanair jet on an internal Italian flight made an emergency landing in Rome today, the second such occurrence 
this week.
The incident occurred after an apparent malfunctioning of its main landing wheel, airport agency Telenews said.
The plane which carried 160 people on board was on a flight from the northern Italian city of Bergamo and due to 
land at Rome's Ciampino airport.
But the pilot re-routed it to the city's main Fiumicino airport because it was closer after receiving a signal about an 
undercarriage problem. Security services were on stand-by but the Boeing 737 landed normally. No one was hurt in 
the incident. On Monday a Ryanair jet plunged 8,000 metres (26,250 feet) in five minutes and a number of 
passengers were taken to hospital after the aircraft made an emergency landing in the central French city of 
Limoges.

If only passengers on the Ryanair Bristol-to-Barcelona flight forced to make an emergency landing this week had 
paid attention to the safety notices. They were, after all, written clearly in crayon on the back of the seat in front of 
them. Then they would have known that when the aircraft lost cabin pressure over France and plunged from 
30,000ft to 8,000ft in a matter of seconds, instead of panicking, the correct emergency procedure was to punch the 
windows open and flap their arms to keep the aircraft aloft.
Such initiatives are just one of a number of fuel-efficient measures being trialled by the budget airline in a bid to 
maintain profitability in the face of rising oil prices. Another under consideration is double-booking the flights and 
flinging excess passengers out in mid-air.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, is encouraging employees to "think outside the box", although not in 
work time.
One idea is to dispense with the aircraft altogether and just have giant catapults daubed in the company's yellow 
and blue. Passengers will be encouraged to load up on £10 mini-packs of Pringles in order to gain extra momentum 
before boarding the human sling.

Irish airline Aer Lingus posts loss for 1st-half
Irish airline Aer Lingus posts loss for 1st-half

Dateline: DUBLIN Ireland
Body
Irish airline Aer Lingus reported a $30.4 million loss for the first half of the year on Thursday, citing the high cost of 
fuel and expenses from labor unrest.
Aer Lingus said it lost 20.6 million (euros for the January-June period, compared to a profit of 6.8 million euros for 
the same period of 2007.
Revenues rose 10.2 percent to 632.9 million euros ($934.6 million) on the back of expanding routes and rising 
charges per passenger. But this was more than offset by a 48.7 percent rise in fuel costs to 172.4 million euros 
($254.6 million).
Shares in the formerly government-owned carrier, which was listed on the Dublin and London markets in 2006, rose 
4.7 percent to 1.49 euros ($2.19) on the Irish Stock Exchange.
Chief Executive Dermot Mannion warned that Aer Lingus would have to keep pruning costs generated by its 4,050 
employees to avoid falling deeper into losses in the coming two years. He declined to specify what cuts he had in 
mind.
The company has been in a protracted battle with labor unions since early 2007 over its efforts to reduce overtime 
costs and reform rigid employment practices. Mannion withheld promised pay rises until unions accepted a plan to 
pare about 20 million euros ($30 million) annually from staff costs.
As part of resolving that standoff earlier this year, Aer Lingus reported an exceptional expense Thursday of 17.6 
million euros ($26 million) to pay compensation to its employees for lost benefits, overtime and back pay. That 
figure compounded the first-half losses.
Aer Lingus dramatically expanded its long-haul route network to the United States over the past year, but that 
strategy backfired when the U.S. economy soured and aviation fuel costs soared. Aer Lingus now plans to shut 
down its Los Angeles service on Nov. 1 and has slapped heavy fuel charges on services to New York, Boston, 
Chicago, Washington and Orlando.
Irish airline Aer Lingus posts loss for 1st-half
The airline said the number of empty seats on its flights rose 5.1 points to 29.8 percent in the first half of 2008, 
chiefly because of insufficient traffic on U.S. routes.
But Aer Lingus is in no danger of going bankrupt. It reported net cash reserves of 802.6 million euros ($1.19 billion), 
up 5 percent since the end of December, making it one of Europe's richest airlines.
The Dublin-based carrier continues to face a simmering takeover threat from its Irish rival Ryanair, its biggest 
shareholder with a 29.8 percent stake. Aer Lingus' other two major stakeholders the Irish government and 
employee-controlled investment trusts, both with approximately 25 percent of shares oppose Ryanair's ambitions.

The ISEQ rose steadily in morning trading today as the market digested another batch of half-year interims and 
despite a collapse in McInerney's shares following a dismal set of results.
By midday, the ISEQ was up 46.62 points to 4,42682.
Shares in house builder, McInerney, plunged by 30pc or 12c to E0.28 after it tumbled to a first half loss of E22.08m 
because of what it called "unprecedented weakened conditions in key markets". The loss for the six months to June 
compares with a profit of E8.18m in the same period last year.
The group also incurred exceptional charges relating to land write-downs (Ireland: E8.2m; UK: E18.9m) and 
restructuring totalling E31.5m. In total, the pre-tax loss, including exceptional items, amounted to E53.6m. "The 
operating loss for the first half of the year is not surprising given the sharp downturn in the UK and Irish housing 
markets. While the Irish sector has been under pressure for some time, the UK market fell off a cliff at the end of 
March," according to Davy's analyst, Robert Gardiner. Shares in the group are today worth six times less than they 
were just over a year ago. Elsewhere, shares in Aer Lingus dropped by nearly 4pc or 6c to E1.37 after it warned 
that job losses could be on the cards after it said it will take a "surgical look" at costs. The statement came after the 
airline said it expects a loss between E22m and E30m in the full year 2008 and sees a "three-figure million" loss as 
possible for 2009. It said that that high costs threatened the long-term viability of its business with fuel costs alone 
accounting for nearly half of the total after the recent surge in crude oil prices. The airline posted an operating loss 
of E22.3m for the first half of this year, down from an operating profit of E2.6m a year earlier, and warned that it will 
not make a profit in the next six months. The results came in below Davy's expectations. "We will adjust our 
numbers following this morning's analyst briefing but it is clear that with fuel remaining high and volatile, significant 
ex-fuel cost savings are needed over and above the legacy cost-saving programmes that have been implemented. 
The shares are currently trading close to their cash value," the broker said. Shares in Ryanair edged up 1c to

cover any future loan losses. "With group profitability likely to be under pressure through 2009 and possibly into

The Dublin market mirrored European shares, which extended gains on optimism about a recovery in the U.S.

44pc in the first half of the year to USD 159.4m as sales of its key Tysabri drug rose sharply. Revenue from the 
multiple sclerosis drug rose seven fold to USD134.3 m during the period, with forward sales growing even more. 
Grafton is due to announce results for the six months to the end of June later today. Reflecting the difficult 
economic environment in the UK and Ireland, Goodbody Stockbrokers are forecasting adjusted earnings per share 
to decline by over 40pc to 21.6c, which is broadly in line with the decline expected for the full year. 'As management 
has already given detailed guidance on the top-line, the focus will be on the level of operating leverage across the 
businesses in this more difficult environment,' according to analyst, Robert Eason. In this regard, Irish margins are 
forecast to decline by over five percentage points to 4.4pc, while in the UK, margins are expected to decline by 60 
basis points to 5.9pc. As a result, group profits are forecast to decline by 40pc to E76m. Shares in the group gained 
3c to E4.00.

Job losses could be on the cards after Aer Lingus today said it will take a "surgical look" at costs.
The statement came after the airline said it expects a loss between E22m and E30m in the full year 2008 and sees 
a "three-figure million" loss as possible for 2009.
It said that that high costs threatened the long-term viability of its business with fuel costs alone accounting for 
nearly half of the total after the recent surge in crude oil prices.
The airline posted an operating loss of E22.3m for the first half of this year, down from an operating profit of E2.6m 
a year earlier, and warned that it will not make a profit in the next six months. Chief executive Dermot Mannion 
blamed oil costs and warned that "without making fundamental changes in our operating cost base" it could make a 
much larger loss in 2009. "Things will not bounce back. We are heading for a pretty difficult challenge, and we need 
to take a surgical look at costs across the whole business," said an Aer Lingus spokesman this morning. He added 
that the company's cost per passenger is roughly double that of rival, Ryanair, suggesting there is the potential to 
take significant costs out of the business. Potential areas for savings include staffing, its flight network and its 
existing deals with the airports it flies to. Aer Lingus has already decided to cut its long-haul capacity for this winter 
by 11pc but is only reducing its short-haul flights by 1pc.

The ISEQ powered ahead today, shrugging off weak results and outlooks from Aer Lingus and McInerney with 
investors piling in to Irish Life and Permanent.
The index gained 114.75 points to 4,494.95.
The Dublin market mirrored European shares, which extended gains on optimism about a recovery in the U.S. 
economy after second-quarter U.S. growth data was revised up more than expected and crude oil prices began to 
come down again.
Back at home, Irish Life and Permanent, the country's largest mortgage lender, climbed nearly 9pc or 52c to E6.44 
after it reassured investors that it could draw more than E1 billion in additional capital from its life assurance 
business to cover any future loan losses. "With group profitability likely to be under pressure through 2009 and 
possibly into 2010 as well, the timing of the planned releases using reinsurance/securitisation will be relevant," said 
Davy's Scott Rankin. The other financials also - with the exception of Anglo Irish - made impressive gains with AIB 
up 60c to E8.75, Bank of Ireland gained 32c to E5.53 while Anglo edged down 2c to E5.70. Shares in Aer Lingus 
dropped by nearly 4pc or 6c to E1.37 after it warned that job losses could be on the cards after it said it would take 
a "surgical look" at costs. The statement came after the airline said it expects a loss between E22m and E30m in

Ryanair today said it plans to shut down two of the seven routes it operates from Cork, blaming increased airport 
charges.
It said the decision follows a 20pc increase in charges being imposed on these two routes, which are to and from 
Cork to East Midlands and Glasgow (Prestwick).
The daily East Midlands flight will cease on October 26, while the daily service to Glasgow (Prestwick) will stop on 
the October 28.
"These cancellations will result in loss of 100,000 passengers at Cork this winter (200,000 in a full year) and 
amounts to a 6pc drop in traffic using Cork Airport. The loss of this traffic will now cost Cork up to E20,000,000 
annually and will result in up to 200 local jobs being lost," Ryanair said. "We regret that we have to close these two 
daily routes to/from Cork. However, a 20pc increase in airport charges on these routes reduces our ability to offer 
really low fares at a time of higher oil prices and these higher costs will make these two new routes loss making this 
winter," the airline's chief executive, michael O'Leary said.

Body
Europe's biggest budget airline Ryanair <RYA.I> said on Tuesday it had provided evidence to a European 
Commission inquiry that ticket-touting websites were consistently over-charging travellers.
At the start of this month, the Irish carrier began cancelling and reimbursing up to 500 bookings a day made by 
online ticket agents known as 'screen scrapers' who were selling the tickets to passengers at inflated prices.
It also said screen scrapers were slowing down its website, preventing its usual customers from making bookings, 
and violating its terms and conditions, price guarantees and copyright.
Media reports said many passengers were angry after missing holidays as a result, and the European Commission 
wrote to Ryanair seeking information on whether the airline was breaking laws on passenger rights.
Ryanair said on Tuesday it had provided the European Commission with evidence of four websites, Bravofly.com, 
Edreams.com, Volgratis.com and Wegelo.com, on which the airline's ticket prices had been inflated by 200-300 
percent.
'We are now calling on the European Commission ... to take action to force these unauthorised, illegal 
screenscraper/ticket tout websites to desist from unlawfully overcharging consumers,' Ryanair CEO Michael 
O'Leary said.
The airline said earlier this month that Irish screen scraper BravoFly Ltd had agreed to stop using Ryanair's website 
after the airline took legal action.

Twenty-six people were hospitalised after a Ryanair aircraft en route from Britain to Spain made an unscheduled 
landing in France following a loss of cabin pressure, emergency workers said Tuesday.
The plane landed at Limoges International Airport on Monday around 11:30 pm (2130 GMT) as a 'safety 
precaution', Ryanair said, adding the passengers were hospitalised for ear problems.
The Boeing 737 was flying to Barcelona-Girona airport in Spain from the southwestern British city of Bristol, when a 
brutal depressurisation forced the aircraft to descend 8,000 metres in five minutes, police said.
Terrified passengers told how they had feared for their lives as the aircraft plummeted and oxygen masks dropped 
down.
Of the 168 passengers and seven crew, 26 were hospitalised with minor eardrum problems, emergency workers 
said.
An initial inspection of the plane did reveal any causes for the depressurisation, police said.
Ryanair dispatched another aircraft to Limoges, which departed at 3:30 am with 127 people who wished to 
immediately continue their journey. The remaining passengers were expected to continue on to Girona later on 
Tuesday.

The airline said it had submitted to the commission evidence concerning four particular sites - Bravofly.com,

The commission began its investigation after Ryanair started cancelling bookings made through the sites from the

The spotlight is back on Aer Lingus. The appointment of a new chairman - Colm Barrington - last week, and the 
release of financial results for the first six months of 2008 on Thursday, mean the airline is back in the headlines.
The context is that the national carrier is trading in markets that are becoming increasingly difficult, and this could 
have implications for the strategy and structure of the company.
Airlines globally are caught in a vice grip comprised of very high fuel prices and a rapid deterioration in consumer 
confidence. This is a dangerous mix for capital-intensive companies such as airlines that are acutely sensitive to 
small changes in unit cost and revenues.
The net result of adverse price movement is a sharp decline in profitability, and often a fast trip into financial losses. 
This pressure has been evident across the world over the past year, and helps explain why airline share prices 
have declined on average by 40 per cent over that period.
The situation in Ireland is compounded for Aer Lingus by trends in the Irish economy and its proximity to Europe's 
lowest cost airline, Ryanair. Evidence of a sharp deterioration in Irish consumer confidence, rising unemployment 
and slowing economic growth is ringing alarm bells for airline executives.
Together, Ryanair and Aer Lingus account for about 70 per cent of air passenger traffic to and from Ireland. But 
unlike Ryanair, which has more than 80 per cent of its traffic outside Ireland, all Aer Lingus flights start or finish on 
the island. As a result, a sharp contraction in economic confidence here is felt quickly by the national carrier.
In addition to this deteriorating macroeconomic backdrop, other factors are also challenging Aer Lingus. Fuel costs 
have doubled in the past year, for example. Fuel accounts for more than 35 per cent of costs in the airline and, 
despite judicious hedging policies over the past five years, the carrier faces a hefty rise in its jet fuel expenses in 
both 2008 and 2009. Additionally, the weakness of the dollar over the past couple of years has been a problem.
Where now for Aer Lingus ?
About 15 per cent of Aer Lingus traffic emanates from the US, and this demand has been dampened by weaker US 
consumer spending and the foreign exchange rate move.
That decline in the dollar helped encourage Irish passengers to take shopping trips last year. But this year, with 
economic pressures mounting, demand from Irish consumers heading to the US is likely to fade somewhat.
All of this will present challenges to the stakeholders in Aer Lingus. How much damage will be done to company 
finances? How should they respond to revenue pressure? What are the strategic implications?
We know how other airlines are responding. In the US, a string of mega mergers has been announced to facilitate 
aggressive cost-cutting and route reductions. In Europe, British Airways and Iberia have announced merger plans, 
and are seeking immunity to forma marketing alliance with American Airlines.
All of this implies that competition in the north Atlantic will hot up. It is estimated that three global networks (which 
individually contain BA, Air France and Lufthansa) will control about 70 per cent of the Atlantic market. That could 
pose problems for Aer Lingus, as these alliances consolidate further.
On short-haul routes, Aer Lingus has performed well to combat the growing threat of other carriers, especially 
Ryanair. Relative to other flag carriers in Europe, Aer Lingus implemented the low-cost culture early and, as a 
result, it continues to trade profitably, despite being next door to Europe's most rapacious price competitor.
So not everything is bleak. Aside from having the nous to react commercially to market threats, Aer Lingus also has 
a significant cash pile, courtesy of a successful IPO in 2006. It is worth noting that the proceeds of that IPO funded 
a new fleet order for Aer Lingus, and allowed its net cash balances to rise above EUR 700 million without tapping 
Irish taxpayers for a red cent.
Imagine what state Aer Lingus would be in today if that IPO had failed and it went looking for more money from the 
government.
Nonetheless, Aer Lingus stakeholders must now address the latest wave of threats to the business. What can they 
do? One idea could be to find a merger partner. Putting Aer Lingus together with another carrier would allow it to 
spread costs and exploit scale benefits.
We have seen how Air France engineered a merger with KLM that retained the latter's brand and its base in 
Schiphol. As importantly perhaps, it also engaged its workers' councils to manage employment issues through the 
merger. All this was done while bringing together carriers that dominate the French-Dutch air routes.
Aer Lingus could be attractive to Air France because the latter has strategic ambitions regarding the Atlantic routes, 
and the use of Heathrow. An alternative merger would be with EasyJet.
Such a move would allow the joining of two identical short-haul Airbus fleets, while leveraging Aer Lingus cash to 
fund a combined fleet expansion. EasyJet could also be domiciled in Ireland to avail of lower corporate tax rates.
Of course the elephant in the room is Ryanair's 29.9 per cent shareholding in Aer Lingus. A merger with it offers 
clear financial upsides for both companies and their shareholders. Yet there is visceral resistance among Aer 
Lingus staff and political circles to such a step. Both of these would need resolution for an agreed merger to be 
consummated.
Aer Lingus can also continue to trade independently, assuming the European Commission view on consolidation 
does not change. In that context, Aer Lingus must further prune its cost base to protect its competitive strengths.
It can use part of its cash resources to fund such a restructuring and bring its unit costs down to levels akin to 
EasyJet and Ryanair.
It could also embark on an acquisition programme, and snap up faltering airlines in Europe. But such a policy would 
need evidence of genuine value enhancement for all shareholders.
Where now for Aer Lingus ?
The airline industry is strewn with carriers that thought they knew how to acquire other companies, and failed 
spectacularly.
Whatever route Aer Lingus takes, its new chairman will have a busy agenda. Next week's interim results will help 
underline how big a challenge he faces.

It's all happening for Babcock & Brown down in Australia.
Fortunately, for Eircom, the Babcock & Brown investment vehicle that owns the Irish telecommunications firm is not 
at the centre of the turmoil.
Shares in Babcock & Brown have fallen by 90 per cent. The international downturn, followed by the credit crunch, 
has hit private equity houses, particularly those whose shares are listed.
Sweeping board changes at Babcock & Brown, including the stepping down of its chief executive and chairman, are 
not likely to have a direct impact on Eircom. The Babcock & Brown entity making the news owns only 8 per cent of 
Eircom.
It does however have the management contract for Babcock & Brown Capital (BCM), which is a separate 
investment fund. This is the one that does actually own a majority stake in Eircom.
But some of the changes will raise questions ahead of Eircom's results which are due out next week. Firstly, the 
departure of Rob Topfer as an executive director of Babcock & Brown is an interesting development.
Topfer will stay on as a non-executive director of Babcock & Brown Capital and be retained as a consultant.
Topfer was really the mastermind behind BCM's takeover of Eircom. He was also very well paid. In 2006 he earned  
8.8 million. Last year his pay packet came in a little below that at  7.3 million.
However, there is still lots of unfinished business at Eircom. The downturn in the economy here has come at a time 
when the company needs to start writing some very large cheques to pay for investment in the network and the 
upgrading of the Meteor network as it embarks on 3G mobile. The most immediate issue is the search for a new 
chairman.
The inquisitor: Storm clouds over Babcock & Brown down under
The word is that the Australians would like an Irish chairman to help de-frost relationships with government and 
Minister for Communications Eamon Ryan in particular.
Ryan turned down Eircom's offer of a massive network upgrade with the government getting a slice of the action, if 
the state paid around  300 million towards the cost.
Other issues include the high cost of servicing the company's  4 billion debt and growing tension with the Employee 
Share Ownership Trust which still owns around 25 per cent of the company.
The new chairman will succeed Pierre Danon who announced he was leaving earlier this year. When the new 
chairman takes over he or she will have lots in the in-tray.
Don't rule out Desmond in BAA break-up The likely break-up of British airport operator, BAA, should have very little 
direct effect on the Irish travelling public. Hopefully, competing owners would improve the quality of service, but 
don't hold your breath.
Ryanair's Michael O'Leary welcomed the announcement from the British competition authority that should see BAA 
sell two of its three London Airports and possibly an airport in Scotland. He called for a break-up of the DAA, 
something which has been on the cards and partially completed for the last five years.
However, it will be very interesting to watch who buys them and how much they pay for them. There is a view in 
Britain that the debacle over the opening of the new Terminal 5 at Heathrow is what really blew it for BAA and its 
chances of holding on to its current asset base.
BAA was bought by its Spanish parent, Ferrovial, two years ago at the top of the market. At the time, the Spaniards 
paid a 30 per cent premium to the value of the regulatory asset base. The price tag was £10.3 billion.
A lot has changed since then and Ferrovial could end up being a forced seller. If so, it will be difficult to judge what 
kind of price might be achieved in a sale. Currently, similar utility companies are making a 10 per cent premium to 
their regulatory asset base.
Likely buyers being mentioned are Global Infrastructure Partners, a joint venture between Credit Suisse and 
General Electric's GE Infrastructural Fund. Changi Airports International, the investment arm of the Singaporean 
airport authorities could also be interested.
Any number of cash rich foreign sovereign wealth funds could also bid. Hochtief, the German construction and 
infrastructure group has also been mentioned.
Of course assets like these don't come on the market very often. It is even more unusual for them to have a 'for 
sale' sign during a downturn and where you have a forced seller.
Perhaps Dermot Desmond could take a look as part of a consortium. He has plenty of cash, from selling London 
City Airport to Global Infrastructure Partners and others for close to  1 billion.
He has a track record of investing in airports, having also bought shares in airport operator TBI International a few 
years ago, and of course he is a former chairman of Aer Rianta.
Desmond was reported to have been close to becoming the new chairman of Aer Lingus but appeared to decide 
not to accept the offer in the end. He may have had bigger fish to fry in the world of aviation.
If utilities are where the action is right now, and those with cash can buy assets cheaply, you couldn't rule Desmond 
out of popping up somewhere in the bidding.

A last-minute rally in banking stocks and a wave of takeover speculation boosted European shares yesterday, but 
failed to cancel out their losses from the start of the week.
The benchmark FTSE Eurofirst 300 jumped 1.8 per cent yesterday to 1,175.79, but ended down 1.2 per cent on the 
week.
Dutch logistics firm  TNT stood out, gaining 6.9 per cent to EUR26.45 on rumours that US rival United Parcel 
Service was preparing to make a bid at the weekend.
Takeover speculation has surrounded TNT for two months, with FedEx also in the frame as a potential suitor. The 
shares fell nearly 18 per cent on July 25 after FedEx was reported to have pulled out of talks.
Meanwhile, Hochtief , the German construction group, gained 8.5 per cent to EUR54.34 on speculation that 
Spanish builder ACS , which owns 25 per cent, was interested in Hochtief's US, Australian and Asian divisions. 
ACS shares rose 2.5 per cent to EUR30.20 after the company denied that it had break-up plans for the company. It 
refused to comment on whether it would make a full takeover bid for Hochtief.
Financials provided much of the upside for European stocks yesterday rallying after recent sharp losses. 
Switzerland's UBS gained 4.8 per cent to SFr22.86, putting it 3.6 per cent higher over the week.
However, yesterday's rally was an isolated bright spot for the European banking sector this week. Fears for the 
health of the government-backed mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the US had cast a pall over 
banks and other businesses exposed to Europe's property market.
Irish banks took a battering, with Anglo Irish Bank down 12.9 per cent to EUR5.53 over the week, Bank of Ireland 
falling 13.5 per cent to EUR5.25 and Allied Irish Banks  sliding 5 per cent to EUR8.22. Irish cement producer CRH 
also slid 7 per cent to EUR16.97.
TNT on delivery end of bid talk
Spanish banks and construction companies also faltered. Sacyr Vallehermoso shed 7 per cent to EUR12.32, 
Banco Popular  lost 4.9 per cent to EUR7.01 and Grupo Ferrovial lost 5.3 per cent to EUR33.36. Ferrovial was 
hurt by fears that its subsidiary BAA will have to sell three of its British airports this year after a report by UK 
competition authorities attacked its dominance of the industry.
Airlines stocks had a bumpy descent as the oil price rallied. Deutsche Lufthansa lost 5.5 per cent to EUR14.44, 
Air France-KLM slid 5.6 per cent to EUR16.43, while budget airline Ryanair sank 10.2 per cent to EUR2.56.
However, oil and mineral stocks crested the gainers list. Portugal's Galp Energia  rose 4 per cent to EUR13.71, 
France's Total added 3.3 per cent to EUR49.17 and Norway's StatoilHydro gained 8.2 per cent to NKr165.60 and 
Austria's OMV climbed 4.1 per cent to EUR42.42.
Mining group Eramet advanced 11 per cent to EUR363.16, while German steel company Salzgitter rose 5.1 per 
cent to EUR103.32.

Ferrovial faced with selling three UK airports

Ferrovial, one of Spain's biggest construction groups, was last night facing the threat of a forced sale of three of its 
British airports next year, after a damning report by UK competition authorities attacked its dominance of the 
industry.
The UK Competition Commission provisionally concluded that Ferrovial's subsidiary, BAA, should be forced to sell 
two of its three London airports - Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted - and either Glasgow or Edinburgh in Scotland. 
The most likely candidates for sale are Gatwick, Stansted and Glasgow, analysts said.
The watchdog, which has been examining whether BAA's near-monopoly of airports in important regions harms 
airlines and passengers, said the sales could take place within six months of it completing its investigation in March 
next year.
The proposals raise the prospect of a bidding war in an industry built around Heathrow, one of the world's busiest 
airports and a leading hub for international trade and business travel.
BAA - battered by criticism over delays and the quality of its facilities, especially at Heathrow - attacked the 
Competition Commission for "creating uncertainty, delay and confusion".
The commission's findings - which will now be put out for consultation - raise questions about the wisdom of 
Ferrovial's purchase of BAA for more than £16bn (EUR20bn), including debt, in 2006. Ferrovial, which had net debt 
of EUR30.2bn in December 2007, may find it difficult to sell assets.
Ryanair's David O'Brien, chairman of the airlines consultative committee at Stansted, said the report confirmed the 
company's near-monopoly was "bad for consumers and bad for Britain".
Ferrovial's shares closed down just 2 cents at EUR33.34.

Body
BAA, the embattled owner of Heathrow, was last night facing the threat of a forced sale of three of its British airports 
next year after a damning report by competition authorities attacked its dominance of the industry.
The company lashed out at the Competition Commission for recommending the forced sale of two of its three 
London airports - Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted - and either Glasgow or Edinburgh in Scotland. The most likely 
candidates for sale are Gatwick, Stansted and Glasgow, analysts said.
BAA chief executive, Colin Matthews said the watchdog's proposals were "flawed" and would create "uncertainty, 
delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time", coming just months ahead of a government decision on whether to 
build a third runway at Heathrow.
The watchdog's far-reaching proposals raise the prospect of a bidding war in an industry built around Heathrow, 
one of the world's busiest airports and a leading hub for international trade and business travel.
Christopher Clarke, commission enquiry chairman, said the sale could take place within six months of the 
completion of the investigation in March next year.
The commission report questioned official policy on airports and will be read in some quarters as an indictment of 
20 years of regulation of a strategic asset by the government, which scrambled yesterday to rebut the -criticisms.
The findings - which will now be put out for consultation - raise questions about the wisdom of Ferrovial's 2006 
purchase of BAA for more than £16bn, including debt. Ferrovial, which had net debt of EUR30.2bn in December 
2007, may find it difficult to sell assets given the squeeze in financial markets.
Ferrovial's shares closed down just 2 cents at EUR33.34.
BAA slams 'flawed' watchdog report
The commission's report, which heralds the biggest shake-up in the airport industry since BAA's privatisation in 
1987, was welcomed by critics of the group. BAA has been battered by prolonged criticism over delays and the 
quality of its facilities.
Ryanair's David O'Brien, chairman of the airlines consultative committee at Stansted, said the report confirmed the 
company's near-monopoly was "bad for consumers and bad for Britain".
BAA holds a 60 per cent market share of all passengers passing through British airports, rising to 84 per cent in 
Scotland and 90 per cent around London, according to commission data.
Mr Clarke said bringing in new owners for some London and Scottish airports could lead to new routes being 
offered, pricing structures being reformed and more money being pumped in.
The Department for Transport defended its aviation policy, which it said looked beyond solely market concerns and 
took into account "the need for growth and local social and environmental considerations".

The long delayed public offering of Poland's flag carrier PLL LOT [LOT.UL] will take place in late 2009 at the 
earliest as it restructures to return to profitability, its chief executive said on Wednesday.
Earlier this month, LOT warned the state-controlled airline needed immediate restructuring to avoid a possible cash 
crunch in the face of rising fuel prices, soaring costs and increasing competition from no frill carriers like Ryanair 
<RYA.I>.
'After the third quarter of 2009, if we find the level of restructuring as satisfactory, it will allow us to move to other 
strategic targets, including an IPO (initial public offering),' said LOT's recently appointed CEO Dariusz Nowak.
'I wouldn't see it before the end of the second quarter of 2009,' he said.
He said new management will decide within a year whether LOT is 'floatable'.
Poland had planned to sell down its 68-percent stake in early 2009 along with a quarter of the airline in the hands of 
the administrator of SwissAir -- a hangover from LOT's first failed privatisation.
LOT, which had five chief executives in five years, wants to return to profit in 2010 after an operating loss of as 
much as 275 million zlotys ($122.2 million) expected this year and 120 million in 2009.
Global airlines have suffered from soaring oil prices and concerns that economic woes would weigh on passenger 
numbers, with some analysts warning that the weakest carriers may have a difficult time surviving.

The European Commission has written to Ryanair <RYA.I> for information on whether the airline is breaking laws 
on passenger rights by cancelling up to 500 passenger-flights a day, a spokesman said on Wednesday.
Europe's biggest budget carrier said it started last week cancelling bookings on its Web site made by online ticket 
agents known as 'screen scrapers' who were then selling them on to passengers at inflated prices.
Around 400-500 tickets are being reimbursed each day because they slow down the Ryanair Web site and violate 
its copyright terms, said a Ryanair spokesman.
But media reports say many passengers remain angry after missing holidays.
'The Commission has sent a letter to Ryanair requesting information in order to assess the compatibility of the 
airline's recent alleged policy... on air passenger rights,' said a Commission source. 'This was a fact-finding letter.'
A Commission spokesman confirmed the request for information, but Ryanair said it had not yet received it.
Ryanair said earlier this month that Irish screen scraper BravoFly Ltd had agreed to stop using Ryanair's Web site

Body
Britain's competition watchdog said it may force airports operator BAA to sell three of its seven airports around the 
country including two in London following fierce criticism of the company for poor customer service, overcrowding 
and long delays.
The interim report from the Competition Commission on Wednesday, which argues that problems at London's 
Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports are a result of BAA's monopoly, was harsher than the industry had 
expected.
The commission said that significant competition issues arose from BAA's common ownership of the seven airports, 
which also include Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen in Scotland and Southampton in southern England.
"This is evident from a large number of factors including its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline 
customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity," said Christopher Clarke, chairman of the inquiry. "This has 
resulted in investment that is not tailored to the requirements of airport users and lower levels and quality of service 
for both airlines and passengers."
The commission will now hold consultations with industry players on which two of BAA's London airports should be 
sold and which one of Edinburgh or Glasgow should be divested, before it announces its final decision in the first 
quarter of next year. It will also discussing potential changes to the regulatory framework to improve competition.
Several airlines have long been pushing for the break up of BAA's stranglehold on Britain's airports. The company 
handles about 90 percent of passenger flights taking off or landing in southeast England and 63 percent of all flights 
to and from Britain.
"Monopolies clearly don't work and the BAA monopoly has done huge damage to competition and the traveling 
public, and it is high time it was broken up," said Jim Callaghan, director of regulatory and legal affairs at budget 
carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC, adding that Stansted was the most expensive of the 150 airports that Ryanair uses 
throughout Europe.
BAA may have to sell 3 of its 7 UK airports
Virgin Atlantic said the interim report was a "major victory for passengers."
BAA, however, was defiant, saying that it has no intention of selling Heathrow, Europe's largest airport.
Heathrow has been the target of the most virulent criticism from passengers after the botched opening of Terminal 
5 earlier this year, when a glitch in the baggage handling system led to thousands of lost bags and hundreds of 
canceled flights.
"This is not the end of the Competition Commission process," said Colin Matthews, BAA's chief executive. "We will 
continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies 
would be disproportionate and counterproductive."
Shares in BAA's owner, Spanish construction company Grupo Ferrovial SA, rose 0.5 percent to 33.53 euros 
($49.35) on the Madrid Stock Exchange. The sale of airports could be a vital cash injection for the company, which 
took on about $20 billion in debt to buy BAA in 2006.
Among the potential buyers for BAA airports are the Manchester Airport Group and Global Infrastructure Partners, 
the joint venture between Credit Suisse and General Electric's GE Infrastructure fund, which took a stake in London 
City airport in 2000.
Analysts also named Germany's Hochtief, which bought Budapest airport from BAA, and Australia's Macquarie 
Group, which owns Brussels and Copenhagen airports.
However, Collins Stewart analyst Andrew Fitchie said that airport valuations have fallen due to tighter credit 
conditions and a more uncertain aviation environment.
"It's never good to be a forced seller," Fitchie added. "We would also expect the uncertainty of changes toughening 
to the regulatory model would weigh down on potential value."
Fitchie said that he saw further downside to the brokerage's 30 euro target share price for Ferrovial and 
recommended a sell.
BAA's Matthews said that the commission risked delaying the delivery of new runways that would improve customer 
service at the airports. New runway capacity is currently scheduled for Stansted in 2015 and Heathrow in 2020.
Matthews added that BAA would seek "urgent clarification" from the government about how the commission report 
could be reconciled with the government's own review of regulation at airports, which is looking at how best to 
provide additional capacity, address the wider environmental impacts of aviation and improve the passenger 
experience.
The Department for Transport said it would consider the provisional findings in detail, adding that it remained 
committed to the outcome of the sustainable delivery of new airport capacity.

Spanair pilots threaten strike over company 'chaos'

Spanair pilots threatened to strike on Wednesday in protest that the loss-making airline, owned by Nordic carrier 
SAS <SAS.ST>, lacked a plan to save itself.
SAS put Spanair up for sale in 2007, but beset by high fuel costs, falling demand and overcapacity in the Spanish 
market, both Iberia <IBLA.MC> and former owners, Spanish travel company Marsans, pulled out of the bidding.
Spanair remains the main drag on SAS, losing 515 million Swedish crowns ($80.90 million) in the first half of 2008. 
SAS has announced plans to cut 25 percent of Spanair's capacity and shed 1,062 jobs.
'This union believes the organised chaos in which the company exists can't continue, and ... it will take the 
necessary steps to issue a strike call,' Spanish airline pilot union Sepla said in a statement.
The Palma de Mallorca based airline was not immediately available to comment on the strike threat.
Management have said they intend to turn the airline around in the next two to three years before restarting the sale 
process.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary told Reuters on Wednesday he was already looking forward to picking up Spanair 
landing slots at Madrid's Barajas airport in what he said was the likely event of it going bust.

British airports operator BAA has been told to sell three of its seven airports after a key regulator said passengers 
and airlines are suffering from competition problems caused by the monopoly.
Britain's Competition Commission said this morning that BAA, owned by Spain's Ferrovial, should sell two of its 
three London airports as well as either Edinburgh or Glasgow.
The regulator has ordered the sale after a preliminary study by it in April found that under a single owner there was 
no competition among some of its airports.
BAA, formed in 1965, owns the London trio of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports plus Southampton and 
three Scottish airports. Its owner Ferrovial has come under fire from British politicians and airline bosses for long 
queues and poor service at Heathrow and Gatwick in the past two years, culminating in the bungled opening of 
Heathrow's Terminal 5. The selloff order is likely to be welcomed by Ryanair, which has long called for the breakup 
of the BAA monopoly in London. A sale will help Ferrovial pay down some of the £ 8.97 bn worth of debt it racked 
up to buy BAA in 2006 as part of its push to diversify out of construction. Total debt at the end of last year stood at 
30 billion euro, while Ferrovial shares have fallen 45 percent in the past 12 months and have underperformed 
European construction shares by 16 percent in that time. Worries over refinancing the debt, potential hitches at 
BAA and Spain's economic slowdown have weighed on the stock. Germany's Fraport and construction group

Body
Ryanair this morning welcomed the UK Competition Commission's call for the break up of UK airports operator, 
BAA and called on the Irish government to break up the Dublin Airports Authority.
Ryanair has long believed that the three competing London airports will lead to better services for passengers, 
improved and more efficient facilities and lower fares, it said.
"Now that monopoly airport ownership, together with an ineffective regulator, has been proven to damage the 
consumer interest, Ryanair calls on the Irish Government to break up the DAA monopoly," it said.
"The Irish Government's 2003 Programme for Government promised the introduction of a competing terminal at 
Dublin. Bertie Ahern welched on this promise, as usual in the face of trade union opposition. As a result over 
W800m is being wasted on Terminal 2 when a 25 million passenger terminal could and should be built for less than 
E200m. This will lead to a doubling of passenger charges at Dublin Airport over the coming years unless a 
competing terminal is developed. Ryanair believes that a competing terminal at Dublin Airport will lead to lower 
fares and better facilities," said Ryanair. Ryanair's Director of Legal and Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan said: 
"The UK Competition Commission has confirmed that monopoly airports and an inadequate regulator has damaged 
the consumer interest in the UK. Sadly Ireland has followed this same failed model, which is why Dublin Airport 
provides such atrocious customer service at ever increasing passenger costs. The way forward is clear, the 
Government must now break up the DAA monopoly and allow competing terminals to deliver what the airport 
monopoly has clearly failed to in recent years." "Irish passengers and visitors deserve better than the high cost, 
inefficient, badly run DAA monopoly".

Ryanair this morning welcomed the UK Competition Commission's call for the break up of UK airports operator, 
BAA and called on the Irish government to break up the Dublin Airports Authority.
Ryanair has long believed that the three competing London airports will lead to better services for passengers, 
improved and more efficient facilities and lower fares, it said.
"Now that monopoly airport ownership, together with an ineffective regulator, has been proven to damage the 
consumer interest, Ryanair calls on the Irish Government to break up the DAA monopoly," it said.
"The Irish Government's 2003 Programme for Government promised the introduction of a competing terminal at 
Dublin. Bertie Ahern welched on this promise, as usual in the face of trade union opposition. As a result over 
W800m is being wasted on Terminal 2 when a 25 million passenger terminal could and should be built for less than 
E200m. This will lead to a doubling of passenger charges at Dublin Airport over the coming years unless a 
competing terminal is developed. Ryanair believes that a competing terminal at Dublin Airport will lead to lower 
fares and better facilities," said Ryanair. Ryanair's Director of Legal and Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan said: 
"The UK Competition Commission has confirmed that monopoly airports and an inadequate regulator has damaged 
the consumer interest in the UK. Sadly Ireland has followed this same failed model, which is why Dublin Airport 
provides such atrocious customer service at ever increasing passenger costs. The way forward is clear, the 
Government must now break up the DAA monopoly and allow competing terminals to deliver what the airport 
monopoly has clearly failed to in recent years." "Irish passengers and visitors deserve better than the high cost, 
inefficient, badly run DAA monopoly".

Nervousness over the state of the Irish and global economies kept the Dublin shares market firmly in the red with 
banks and Ryanair the biggest fallers.
At the close, the ISEQ was down 36.16 points to 4,297.37.
A minor rally in European shares as commodity - and especially oil - prices bounced did nothing to help Irish 
equities amid mounting evidence of the depth of the slowdown in the Irish economy.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate increased from 4.8pc to 5.1pc between the first and second quarters of 
2008 with 115,500 registered as jobless, the latest Quarterly National Household Survey from the CSO shows. The 
slump in the construction sector was behind much of the jobless rise with the number of jobs down by a massive 
26,800 or 9.5pc in the year to the second quarter of 2008, compared with an annual growth rate of 6.3pc to the 
second quarter of 2007. International factors also weighed. Poor data for US housing and inflation, compounded by 
fears over the fragility of the financial sector, took their toll on US equity markets and dampened demand in Dublin. 
Meanwhile, a sharp rise in the number of houses and apartments on the market has seen a drop in rents - 
symptomatic of the decline in the buy-to-let market, a report from Daft.ie showed today. These properties comprise 
26.8pc of the value of outstanding residential mortgages (unadjusted for securitisations and reclassifications) in 
Ireland, according to the most recent central bank data. Shares in Irish banks fell sharply with AIB down 14c to 
E7.99, Bank of Ireland declined by 7c to E5.39, Anglo Irish dropped by 22c to E5.50 and Irish Life and Permanent 
was down 17c to E5.33. Irish Life and Permanent is due to release first half 2008 interim results next Wednesday. 
Goodbody is predicting operating earnings per share of 96 cent, which would be 7pc lower than the first half of 2007 
but basic earnings per share will be down 84pc to an estimated 16.4 cent due to "negative short term investment 
variances," analyst, Eamonn Hughes said. Ryanair was a major faller with shares down 8c to E2.56 after it 
welcomed the forthcoming breakup of UK airports operator, BAA and called for a similar fate for the DAA here. 
ISEQ falls on economic woes ISEQ Down
Meanwhile, a 'perfect storm' of soaring fuel costs and slipping demand could cost global airlines USD6.1 billion this 
year, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said today. Shares in Ireland's biggest plc, CRH, fell by 28c 
to E16.73. In its biggest market - the US - Home Depot, the largest US home improvement retailer, reported better-
than-expected results for the second quarter. The group reported second quarter earnings per share of 71c versus 
the street's estimate of 61c. Sales came in at USD21bn versus consensus of USD20.6bn as like-for-like sales fell 
7.9pc. Elsewhere in the sector, Grafton dropped 3c to E3.82 and Kingspan gained 3c to E6.59. Elsewhere, shares 
in Glanbia fell by 5c to E4.30. UK farm-gate prices rose at a record level in June, when the aggregate year-on-year 
price rise was 29.8pc. For the three months ended June, prices rose by 28.4pc annually, while year-to-date the 
annual rise is 26.7pc.

Break up London airports monopoly

From Mr Michael O'Leary.
Sir, All airlines and passengers will welcome your editorial "Give choice a try" (August 13) calling for the UK 
Competition Commission to break up the BAA airport monopoly. Monopolies don't work. Competition does.
For far too long this airport monopoly operator aided and abetted by a weak and ineffective regulator has been 
overcharging airlines and passengers, while delivering a third-rate service to airlines and passengers. What is 
needed is for Gatwick, Stansted and Heathrow to compete with each other offering passengers what they want 
which is low-cost and efficient airport facilities.
Breaking up this monopoly will not deliver an immediate solution. This is because the BAA monopoly has 
underdeveloped capacity at the London airports for many years, precisely so that it can rapaciously increase its 
high charges. The ineffective regulator then allows them to inflate their capital expenditure and passenger charges 
in order to "incentivise" the BAA monopoly to take the "risk" of expanding these scarce facilities.
The best way to fix this national embarrassment is for the Competition Commission to recommend the break-up of 
three major London airports into three separate competing companies. Each of these airport operators will then 
compete aggressively to develop additional runways, and additional efficient terminal facilities to meet airline and 
passenger needs. At Stansted Ryanair has offered to pay for and develop a second runway and terminal for less 
than one-quarter of the £4bn presently being wasted by the BAA delivering these facilities. Competition between the 
three main London airports will deliver this additional capacity, faster, more cheaply and in a more user-centred 
manner than the BAA monopoly ever has.
We sincerely hope the Competition Commission will not opt for an ineffective half-measure such as that proposed 
by the BAA of just selling Gatwick. On its own this will not deliver effective competition, since it will leave the BAA 
monopoly with ownership and the ability to waste billions of pounds at the other two London airports. We hope, in 
the interests of airlines and users, that the Competition Commission will be brave and force the sale of both Gatwick 
and Stansted. Let us finally end the BAA airport monopoly that has done so much damage to London and British 
tourism in recent years. Here's hoping the Competition Commission lives up to its name and breaks up the BAA 
(Britain's Awful Airports).
Break up London airports monopoly
Michael O'Leary,
Chief Executive,

China bites into brands
China bites into brands

Branded goods are being snapped up by the new middle class, but how can Ireland capitalise, asks Nicola Cooke.
Irish companies are among the many thousands worldwide hoping to get spin-off benefits from the estimated 
advertising spend of $6 billion by major multinationals at the Olympic Games in Beijing.
During the Olympics, more than one billion Chinese citizens have been exposed to more western brands than ever 
before. While the majority of these are global players such as Pepsi, Visa and Nike, a likely lasting aftermath of the 
Beijing games is that the Chinese love affair with western brands will blossom further.
While China is doing its utmost to promote itself on the world stage, the commercial brands that are Olympic 
sponsors are taking advantage of the huge interest - and national pride in the games - to raise their profile in the 
domestic Chinese market.
The rapid rise in earnings of a large swathe of the population and the rapid growth of a new middle class - due to a 
massive economic turnaround in recent decades - means more disposable income is available to spend on luxury 
products there than ever before.
Middle-class Chinese people use branded goods, from fashion accessories and mobile phones to cars, to display 
their new-found wealth and distinguish themselves from the working classes - with the result that global brands are 
willing to pour money into advertising campaigns for a bigger slice of this lucrative pie.
Interestingly, most of these companies have two separate campaigns for the Olympics - one of them their main 
global campaign and the other aimed at the Chinese market.
The Chinese campaigns generally aim to capitalise on - and associate themselves with - the surge in the country's 
national pride in playing host to the games. These include Pepsi's limited edition red-coloured cans with the slogan 
'go red for China' and Volkswagen's 'honk for China' campaign.
China bites into brands
Brandforce is an Irish company whose clients include Goodbody, Ryanair and Bank of Ireland.
Paddy Lynch, managing director of Brandforce, said a ''world event'' like the Olympics is the perfect stage for larger 
brands, as it gives them an immediate audience and opens up the Chinese market further for them.
''The top ten brands that are sponsoring these games are almost identical to the top ten at the Sydney Olympics 
eight years ago, so they are obviously getting a good return from such exposure," he said.
''The likes of Coca-Cola, Mastercard and Visa would also have a presence in golfing championships, or the 
European football championships, for example.
''China is one of the world's biggest emerging markets so getting a good foothold there is vital for these companies. 
The cultural changes, rising disposable income, and changes in the education sector mean the country is more 
open than ever to western products.
''Just look at how big Manchester United are in Asia as a football brand. They usually play a match or two there 
every year because the merchandising of their goods in the Asian market is so valuable to the club. Without doubt, 
the Olympics will make it easier for Irish companies to sell their products in China, because this event is bringing 
China out to the rest of the world, so to speak. Their love of western brands is already established too,'' Lynch said.
China is already a growing market for Irish exports, as the 33 per cent increase in sales to this market in the first six 
months of this year bears out.
Between January and June this year the value of exports to the 2008 Olympic hosts grew from  880million for the 
same period last year, to  1.2 billion this year. This still only represents 3 per cent of the Irish exports market.
Irish Exporters Association (IEA) chief executive John Whelan said the Olympics will have a ''definite and sizeable'' 
effect of opening more markets in China to Irish products.
''The exposure of the Chinese population to both the competitors using various products, and the vendors pushing 
other ones, will have a significant effect. The impact of exposure through TV coverage and ad breaks - along with 
attendance at the games - will open up the market for more western goods.
''We have already seen a significant take-up in exports from Ireland to China in the last year, when exports to key 
markets like Europe and the US have fallen,'' Whelan said.
Irish food products - like dairy products and powdered baby milk along with software and technology components - 
are the current star performers in the Asian market.
The IEA chief executive believes there is scope for much more growth, and cited the pharmaceutical and beverage 
sectors as likely future beneficiaries.
''The Chinese are already avid buyers of western goods and the rapid rise in salaries mean the affordabilty factor is 
there. It is clear the demand for goods is rising exponentially, but the question is how much can we capitalise on 
this with the US and UK turning their focus to this market?
''Advertising is critical and that's why partnerships with well-heeled and deep-pocketed local distributors, that 
represent Irish companies, is vital. Joint ventures to promote our products works well," he said.
The barriers to trade that were once such a deterrent to doing business in China, are now almost all eliminated, 
according to the IEA - which expects to grow the value of Irish exports to China to  10 billion within five years.
Whether the Beijing Olympics will herald the 'McDonaldisation' of China has yet to be seen, but western brands 
seem destined to benefit from such a large market - with disposable income - that already lusts after their numerous 
products.

Air travellers are facing severe disruption over the August bank holiday be-cause of strikes over pay by baggage 
handlers and check-in staff at Gatwick and Stansted.
The airports are due to be hit by two one-day stoppages: the first on August 25 with a second 24-hour strike 
planned for August 29. Workers at Manchester, Birmingham and Newcastle airports are also to be balloted, 
according to Unite and GMB, the workers' unions.
The dispute involving more than 500 baggage handlers and staff employed by Swissport threatens a large 
proportion of flights at Gatwick and Stansted. Swissport is owned by Ferrovial of Spain, which also owns BAA, 
operator of Gatwick and Stansted. BAA, which also owns Heathrow, is under investigation by the Competition 
Commission.
Unite, the country's biggest union, said that the Gatwick stoppage "would halt all baggage-handling and check-in 
operations at Virgin Atlantic, Monarch, Thomson Fly, First Choice, North West, Air Malta, Air Transat, Oman Air as 
well as some smaller airlines."
At Stansted, "the strike will impact EasyJet, Ryan-air, First Choice, Thompson and others," it said. EasyJet and 
Ryanair account for about 80 per cent of flights at Stansted.
The union said the Swissport workers had rejected a "paltry'' 3 per cent offer complaining that it was well below the 
inflation rate of 5 per cent, as measured by the retail price index.

BAA faces the threat of being forced to sell two of its three London airports under plans to be published by the 
competition watchdog next week, the Financial Times has learnt.
The Competition Commission's provisional findings in its 16-month probe into BAA include a proposal to strip it of 
all but one of its Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted operations, people familiar with the matter say.
The plan, part of a menu of possible reforms to counter BAA's market dominance, is the most striking sign yet of the 
investigation's potentially alarming consequences for Ferrovial, BAA's embattled Spanish owner.
Ferrovial may face having to break up the network of seven British airports, including near-monopolies in the south-
east and Scotland, that underpinned its purchase of BAA for more than £10bn less than three years ago.
BAA holds a 60 per cent market share of all passengers passing through British airports, rising to 84 per cent in 
Scotland and 90 per cent around London, according to commission data.
Some leading business people and airlines, such as Ryanair, are likely to welcome the commission's proposals. 
They say BAA's dominance is disastrous for passengers since it stymies investment in new capacity.
The commission will float the London airport sales plan alongside other options to break BAA's grip through less 
severe asset disposals and tighter regulation, people familiar with the matter say. Another proposal would force 
BAA to sell either Glasgow or Edinburgh airport.
The watchdog has to publish its final conclusions within eight months. Both the commission and BAA declined to 
comment.

European shares rose by midday on Friday as a weaker oil price boosted leisure and consumer stocks, while 
commodity shares fell in concert with easing raw material prices.
By 1050 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> was up 0.5 percent at 1,191.06 points, adding 
to a 0.5-percent gain from the previous session and on track to finish the week some 0.7 percent lower.
The oil price dropped by $2 to $113 a barrel, trading near the lowest since early May, pressured by faltering global 
demand and rising supply, boosting consumer, travel and leisure shares.
'This is a supporting factor for the automotive sector as well as for demand-driven industries as consumers feel the 
relief through lower fuel prices,' said Markus Reinwand, equity strategist at German bank Helaba.
The European travel and leisure index <.SXTP> and the DJ Stoxx European retail index <.SXRP> as well as the DJ 
Stoxx European Personal and Household Goods sector index <.SXQP> jumped more than 1 percent each.
Airlines such as Ryanair <RYA.I> rose 4.6 percent, Air France <AIRF.PA> gained 2.3 percent and Deutsche 
Lufthansa <LHAG.DE> by 0.8 percent.
Oil majors such as Total <TOTF.PA> rose 0.8 percent and Royal Dutch Shell <RDSa.AS> gained 0.6 percent.
Among retail stocks Swedish fashion giant Hennes & Mauritz <HMb.ST> rose 2.4 percent after posting better-than-
expected July sales figures, defying an economic slowdown as cost-conscious shoppers appeared to favour its 
moderately priced clothes.
Defensive pharmaceutical stocks also gained, with Sanofi-Aventis <SASY.PA> up 2.3 percent after Warren Buffett's 
Berkshire Hathaway <BRKa.N> investment group raised its stake.
Shares in Stada <STAGn.DE> surged 10.6 percent after a media report, citing unidentified sources, said that Teva 
Pharmaceutical Industries <TEVA.O><TEVA.TA> was in talks to buy Germany's third-largest generics drugmaker.
Stada and Teva declined to comment.
Roche <ROG.VX> rose 0.8 percent and Elan <ELN.I> added 7.2 percent.
European shares up by midday, helped by weaker oil
Banks rose with Swiss bank UBS <UBSN.VX> rising 2.2 percent, Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> up 1.1 percent 
and BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> up 1 percent.
DOLLAR STRENGTH
The dollar powered to a six month high against the euro, boosted by jitters on shrinking euro area economic growth.
Citigroup said the economy in the euro area is set for a longer and deeper downturn than the consensus expects.
'The rapid deterioration in the economy's prospects partly reflects the severity of the headwinds from the tightening 
in lending standards, European Central Bank's rate hikes, high commodity prices and strong euro,' Citigroup said in 
a note.
The rise in the dollar sparked a sell-off in commodities and gold fell nearly 5 percent to almost a nine-month low in 
Europe.
As a result, mining stocks had the strongest negative impact on the pan European index, with Xstrata <XTA.L>, 
Anglo American <AAL.L>, Rio Tinto <RIO.L> and BHP Billiton <BLT.L> falling between 1.6 and 3.5 percent.
Around Europe, the UK's FTSE 100 index <.FTSE> rose 0.2 percent, Germany's DAX index <.GDAXI> added 0.2 
percent and France's CAC 40 <.FCHI> gained 0.9 percent.
Among major gainers, Denmark's Vestas <VWS.CO> rose 5.5 percent after the world's No.1 wind turbine maker 
said its order backlog ballooned.

Irish budget airline Ryanair said on Thursday its decision to cancel reservations made at third-party websites will 
take effect on Aug 26.
The no-frills carrier said last week it would not honour 'unlawful' bookings that were not made on its own website 
and its telephone reservations line.
It accused what it called screenscraping websites of levying 'unnecessary' handling charges, of failing to provide 
up-to-date flight information and of delaying access to the airline's own website by its customers.
Sinead Finn, the airline's director of commercial revenue, clarified at a news conference in Barcelona on Thursday 
that the decision will be effective two weeks from last Monday, or on Aug 26. She said passengers affected will be 
reimbursed. Spain's transport ministry on Tuesday said it is investigating Ryanair over the decision, which Spanish

News In Brief
## An uncharacteristically repentant Michael O'Leary has admitted he "screwed up" by failing to insulate Ryanair 
against massive rises in the price of oil. His poor calls on oil prices contributed to an 85pc plunge in his airline's 
profits for the first quarter, and could see Ryanair soon report its first annual loss in 20 years. "Clearly anybody who 
didn't hedge oil a year ago at E70 couldn't possibly claim that they were on top of their game," the Mullingar man 
told a press conference yesterday, adding that he'd "screwed up in the last year". - Irish Independent
## A subsidiary of Irish utility NTR is planning to build one of the US's biggest recycling facilities. Greenstar North 
America has leased a building in San Antonio, Texas, and is planning to build a recycling plant there for municipal 
and commercial waste. The facility will be located in a 180,000sq ft building on a nine-acre site on the east side of 
the city. It will handle 20,000 tonnes a month, making it the biggest recycling centre in Texas and one of the largest 
in the US. - Irish Times
## An insulation company in Co Tipperary is to close its production unit in October with the loss of 44 jobs. Moy 
Isover, based in Ardfinnan, supplies insulation products to the building sector. The company will retain 12 staff in its 
sales, marketing and distribution sections in Ardfinnan. In a statement, the company said it regretted the decision, 
which was taken as a direct result of the downturn in the construction sector. - RTE ## Dublin investment group Ion 
Equity is planning to spend tens of millions of euro to create a new chain of premium budget hotels in Ireland and 
the UK. Industry sources have said that the private equity and corporate advisory firm has assembled a team that 
includes three former senior Jurys Doyle executives to spearhead the project that will see hotels constructed in 
major city centre locations. Operating under the name of Pillo Hotels, Ion Equity is understood to be close to 
finalising the acquisition of a site in Manchester for one of the first outlets in the chain, while further locations 
throughout the UK and Ireland are currently being examined. - Irish Independent ## Businessman Leslie Buckley 
O'Leary admits he "screwed up" on oil O'Leary Screwup
has withdrawn as an investor in the fledgling Caribbean low-cost airline Airone Ventures, which is backed by a 
number of Irish entrepreneurs. A spokesman for Mr Buckley confirmed yesterday that the Cork-born executive has 
exited from Airone. It is not clear how much Mr Buckley invested in the project or what the level of his shareholding 
was. Airone is seeking a licence to launch services from Barbados and hopes to begin flying in the spring of 2009. 
Earlier this year, the airline failed to secure a licence to operate from Jamaica. It had hoped to begin flying from the 
island in May. - Irish Times ## The Health Service Executive paid out E142 million last year for replacement staff 
because of the high level of absenteeism in the health sector. An internal review of the performance of 23 hospitals 
found overall absenteeism rates of 8pc. In comparison, the average figure for the private sector is just 3.4pc. 
However, the audit also found an alarming level of sick days among nurses and general support staff - with more 
than 10pc missing from certain hospitals at any one time. - Irish Examiner ## Sean Quinn and his family have 
completed their purchase of a shareholding of almost 15 per cent in Anglo Irish Bank, the State's third-largest bank, 
their spokesman has confirmed. The family said last month that they were in the process of "unwinding" their 
interests in Anglo through contracts for difference, a form of share derivative, and that individual family members 
were buying shares in the bank, giving them an overall stake of almost 15 per cent. - Irish Times ## Plans to 
redevelop the Bank of Ireland HQ which would see two storeys added to one of Dublin's most iconic buildings have 
been shot down. Dublin City Council has refused planning permission for the development saying that any changes 
to the protected structure on Baggot Street would have a "significant undesirable impact" on the integrity of the 
complex and "seriously detract" from the area. Architects HKR had proposed adding two extra storeys in "glass 
boxes" to two of the three blocks, and covering much of the courtyard with a glazed atrium. The building was 
bought by a consortium including businessman Paddy Shovlin and financier Derek Quinlan for 200m euro in 2006. -

I'm sure I read somewhere that the easiest way to become a millionaire is to start by being a billionaire and invest in 
airline stocks well something like that anyway. That phrase was probably created before the introduction of CFDs 
and Spread Betting where you could have shorted your way to a fortune via the aviation business.
My last airline tip (shortBritish Airways on 9 May) resulted in a 13% gain. I'm now focusing on a long position, this 
time in the discount airlineeasyJet (EZJ).
One of the biggest factors about investing in the aviation business is costs and seeing that the oil price has risen 
dramatically over the last six years, airlines have really had their work cut-out to improve profitability.
However, with oil off some $30 from the recent highs of $147, positive sentiment is returning to the sector. easyJet 
has just 28% of its fuel hedged for winter 2008/2009, which means that it is 72% exposed to the vagaries of the oil 
price, so it should reap the rewards should the oil price decline even further.
July's passenger growth was up an impressive 20% in July with 4.5 million paid passenger seats. This is not bad at 
all when you consider the fierce competition and poor consumer sentiment.
In fact it should be companies like the discount airlines of RyanAir and easyJet that prosper in the credit crunch 
zeitgeist as people 'trade-down' from more expensive airlines such as British Airways among others.
On the technical's, the 50-day moving average has effectively stopped falling and is now in fact heading upwards, 
suggesting that the overall trend has reversed from the downside to the upside. Long positions should be 
considered at market with a stop loss at 327p and a target of 389p.
We have recently witnessed stocks such as Barratt Developments (BDEV),Barclays (BARC) and Trinity Mirror (TNI) 
among others rally most likely on the back of bears closing out their short positions. Some of these so called 
'recovery stocks' are now starting to give back some of those substantial gains and one I think that might do the 
same is that of £111 million market cap Manganese Bronze (MNGS), the London taxi cab company.
The stock has rallied some 57% since early July and it looks as though, at the very least from a technical point of 
view, that the recent gains will be whittled away by short-sellers and profit-takers.
The CFDealer: Sky could be the limit if you go long on easyJet
Manganese recently issued its interim results showing profit before tax leaping to £1.5 million (£0.5 million 2007) 
despite like-for-like UK sales falling by 30%. The rise in profits is largely attributable to the servicing of the cabs. Net 
debt grew by £7 million compared to a £0.6 million net surplus of funds the previous year.
Despite this seemingly positive news, the company has encountered headwinds such as buying engines from Italy 
where earnings were adversely impacted by a negative Euro conversion.
On top of this there is a new threat to the London Taxi in the form of the six seater Mercedes Vito taxi, priced at a 
competitive £35,000 against Manganese's similarly priced TX4 model. While both have their individual merits and 
pitfalls, the fact that Manganese have a real competitive threat after having a virtual monopoly on the business via 
LTI (London Taxi International which Manganese 100% own) for the last 60 years, may be a serious problem to its 
future earnings.
On top of this drivers, by Manganese's own confession, are concerned about the economic outlook for the UK and 
some are holding off purchases until they see a better financial outlook.
The stock currently trades on a prospective 2009 multiple of 40 times, falling to 17 for 2010. This rating seems too 
optimistic given the economic uncertainty and competition threat among other risk factors. Short positions should be 
considered at market with a stop loss at 479p and a target of 376p.
This report was written by Graeme Dickson of Lite Financial (contact thecfdealer@litefinancial.com). The writer 
holds a short position in Manganese Bronze via CFDs but does not own any share or derivatives in any other 
company mentioned above. The material for this report came from Thestreet.com, Manganese Bronze's website, 
Citywire and Hemscott.

Ryanair <RYA.I> <RYA.L> has no interest in buying Stansted airport though the airline would be happy to 
cooperate with any potential buyers, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said.
The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported last week that Ryanair was interested in launching a takeover bid for 
Stansted airport, operated by BAA, itself controlled by Spain's Ferrovial <FER.MC>, but O'Leary said the paper had 
misinterpreted his comments.
'We have no interest in acquiring airports,' O'Leary told a news conference in Dublin on Thursday.

Irish budget airline Ryanair said on Thursday its decision to cancel reservations made at third-party websites will 
take effect on Aug 26.
The no-frills carrier said last week it would not honour 'unlawful' bookings that were not made on its own website 
and its telephone reservations line.
It accused what it called screenscraping websites of levying 'unnecessary' handling charges, of failing to provide 
up-to-date flight information and of delaying access to the airline's own website by its customers.
Sinead Finn, the airline's director of commercial revenue, clarified at a news conference in Barcelona on Thursday 
that the decision will be effective two weeks from last Monday, or on Aug 26.
She said passengers affected will be reimbursed.
Spain's transport ministry on Tuesday said it is investigating Ryanair over the decision, which Spanish media said 
could affect about 1,000 air reservations a day in Spain.
The Spanish-based eDreams website vowed on Thursday to take 'suitable legal measures' if Ryanair violates the 
rights of its customers.
The airline has already taken legal action against two sites, Ireland's Bravofly and V-tours of Germany, to prevent 
them from listing Ryanair flights.

Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the airline remained unhedged on fuel for its fourth quarter and its 
outlook was unchanged.
'We're still unhedged for Q4, we haven't extended our hedging programme any further,' O'Leary told Reuters in a 
telephone interview.
O'Leary said last month that a failure to hedge against high fuel prices and a consumer downturn could plunge 
Europe's largest low-cost carrier into the red for the first time in almost two decades.
Ryanair said in July it expected a full-year result between breakeven and a loss of 60 million euros (USD89.86 
million) on the basis of its existing fuel hedges, fourth-quarter oil prices estimated at around USD130 per barrel and 
average fares falling by 5 percent. Oil was trading at USD117 a barrel today. 'We have not changed the guidance, 
but you don't need to be a genius to work out oil is not at USD130 a barrel,' O'Leary said on Thursday. Copyright

average fares falling by 5 percent. Oil was trading at USD117 a barrel today. 'We have not changed the guidance, 
but you don't need to be a genius to work out oil is not at USD130 a barrel,' O'Leary said on Thursday. Copyright

Spain has started an investigation into Ryanair's decision to cancel thousands of bookings made through third party 
websites.
The country's transport ministry has opened the probe after Ryanair moved against the so called "screen-scraping" 
sites.
The airline says that the bookings, which number an estimated one thousand daily, are illegal.
However, consumer groups have hit out at the move, which has been taken in the middle of the peak holiday 
season. Separately, the Italian transport minister has called the airline's move "deplorable and incomprehensible".

The airline today announced that it is offering five million one-way seats at E10 each - including taxes and charges.
Mr O'Leary this morning said that the company is committed to cutting ticket prices by 5pc this winter despite 
having cut capacity at several of its hubs, including Dublin and Stansted.
He had admitted that the strategy could push the airline in to a loss at the end of the year but added that, while 
other carriers went to the wall, Ryanair would emerge from the high-fuel, low demand downturn stronger than

Spain's government has demanded information from Irish airline Ryanair after travel agencies warned the firm was 
threatening to strand thousands of passengers who booked through online brokers.
The public works ministry is now waiting for an answer from Ryanair about its plans to cancel tickets booked 
through Spain's leading online bookers, eDreams, Rumbo and Atrapolo, before deciding whether to take further 
action, a spokeswoman said.
'After the media reports at the weekend, on Monday we acted,' said a ministry spokeswoman.
However, she said the ministry would not necessarily take action against Ryanair as a result.
'The ministry only acts if we find a breach to the law on passenger rights.'
Ryanair has said it is cancelling all flights booked through online travel agencies, which Ryanair calls 
screenscrapers, as it considers the sites are acting illegally.
In a statement, Ryanair said getting rid of agencies would speed up passenger processing times on Ryanair.com 
and ensure passengers are not paying unnecessary handling charges or higher fares.
The Irish no-frills airline is already taking legal action against online bookers in Spain to stop them selling tickets, as 
well as against Irish booker BravoFly and German booker Vtours.
'They can't just take something off our website to resell it,' said Ryanair spokesman Daniel de Carvalho.
He said passengers would have to seek refunds from online agencies.
Spanish agencies reacted angrily to Ryanair's latest move.
Edreams said it was exploring legal action against the Irish airline for damage caused to customers for the 
cancellation of thousands of paid and confirmed bookings.
'Ryanair doesn't want travel agents to offer comparative prices and thereby to show that in many cases Ryanair is 
the most expensive option,' Edreams said in a statement.

Flight price comparison site, BravoFly, has denied that Ryanair has scored a legal victory in its campaign to stop 
"screenscraping".
Swiss-based BravoFly said that it was untrue that it has suspended its activity of screenscraping of Ryanair.com in 
order to comply with legal proceedings brought against it and Bravofly SA in Ireland.
"The news is completely unfounded and entirely false. This Ryanair press statement is both misleading and false," it 
said.
"Bravofly SA continues to carry out its activities with complete respect of the law, guaranteeing its users simple and 
fast service for choosing and purchasing flights online. Given that the services offered conform to European 
regulations, Bravofly SA has already requested that the Swiss court voice itself on the legitimacy of its proper 
operation with regard to Ryanair's claims," it added. The company said it has also asked the judges to assess the 
legality of the low cost Irish airline's conduct in relation to the "false and defamatory news spread through its own 
press releases". Last week, Ryanair said any bookings made using third parties, including price comparison and 
'screenscraping' websites, will be cancelled and refunded on the grounds that these sites violate the airline's

Profit taking dominated morning trading on the Dublin stock market today with banking shares hit by worse than

By midday, the ISEQ index was down 9.75 points to 4,680.12.
Switzerland's largest bank UBS reported worse-than-expected second quarter losses amid heavy U.S. real estate 
market-related writedowns sending European banking shares lower.
Meanwhile, the US Fed's senior loan officer survey showed a marked tightening of credit. It was most acute in the 
consumer area where both standards on credit cards and on other consumer loans tightened sharply between the 
second and third quarters. Commercial lending has also been squeezed significantly. Both US consumer spending 
and investment are set to suffer in H2 with implications for growth and commodity prices in the rest of the world. 
Shares in AIB were down 6c to E9.17, Bank of Ireland managed to edge up 3c to E6.34, Anglo Irish dropped by 11c 
to E6.72 and Irish Life and Permanent declined by 9c to E6.70. Anglo Irish delivers its pre-close trading statement 
for the year to September 2008 tomorrow morning. Davy Research is forecasting full-year earnings per share of 
151.5c. This is a tad ahead of consensus of 149c and in line with Anglo management guidance of 15pc earnings 
growth, which Davy expects will be reiterated. At the half-way stage, work-in-progress stood at E6.8 billion, with net 
new lending for the year guided at around E10 billion. "We are forecasting E7.8 billion of net new lending, which 
translates into loan book growth of 12pc," according to analyst, Niamh Hore. Shares in independent News and

Profit taking dominated morning trading on the Dublin stock market today with banking shares hit by worse than 
expected results from UBS.
By midday, the ISEQ index was down 9.75 points to 4,680.12.
Switzerland's largest bank UBS reported worse-than-expected second quarter losses amid heavy U.S. real estate 
market-related writedowns sending European banking shares lower.
Meanwhile, the US Fed's senior loan officer survey showed a marked tightening of credit. It was most acute in the 
consumer area where both standards on credit cards and on other consumer loans tightened sharply between the 
second and third quarters. Commercial lending has also been squeezed significantly. Both US consumer spending 
and investment are set to suffer in H2 with implications for growth and commodity prices in the rest of the world. 
Shares in AIB were down 6c to E9.17, Bank of Ireland managed to edge up 3c to E6.34, Anglo Irish dropped by 11c 
to E6.72 and Irish Life and Permanent declined by 9c to E6.70. Anglo Irish delivers its pre-close trading statement

The public works ministry is now waiting for an answer from Ryanair about its plans to cancel tickets booked

action, a spokeswoman said.
However, she said the ministry would not necessarily take action against Ryanair.

Ryanair has shocked the travel industry by cancelling thousands of flight bookings made through so-called 
"screenscrapers".
These are internet sites that comb through many sites to compare prices and to book flights for customers.
The Irish low-cost airline says any bookings made using third parties, including price comparison and 
'screenscraping' websites, will be cancelled and refunded from today.
Ryanair has had a very public battle with screenscraping sites including Bravofly, based in Ireland, which it has 
taken to court accusing it of infringing Ryanair's copyright. The airline is now emailing anyone who's bought tickets 
through a third party to advise them that their ticket has been cancelled. It says it will only refund the ticket price, not 
any commission added by the third party. Any passengers who aren't successfully contacted will discover that 
they'll be turned away at the check-in desk. Ryanair says that it will only accept bookings made directly via its 
ryanair.com website. Bravofly Ltd has confirmed to the Swiss Courts that it has ceased screenscraping 
Ryanair.com's website. "Bravofly's statement fails to explain why they have been adding hidden handling charges 
of up to 200pc to the cost of a Ryanair ticket. For example on Monday 21st July 2008 Bravofly were charging 
E60.98 for a E19.98 Ryanair return ticket between Dublin and London," Ryanair said today.

The Dublin market clawed its way back above the 4,600 level this morning as banks, Smurfit Kappa and Ryanair 
shares surged.
By midday, the ISEQ was 119.99 points higher at 4,633.05.
Hopes that the worst of the credit crisis is behind us and that the unprecedented rally in commodity prices - 
especially crude oil - is over has sparked a general rally in the depressed Irish shares market over the past week or 
so.
Traders are braced for heavy falls in commodity prices this week, after the US dollar posted its biggest one-day 
gain against the euro for eight years on Friday. Analysts are already talking about the end of the commodities boom 
with the spread of economic contagion beyond the US becoming less chronic. Banks - by far the biggest fallers in 
the historic slump in equities - were once again big winners today. AIB shares jumped by 46c to E9.30, Bank of 
Ireland gained by 11c to E6.17, Anglo Irish climbed by 24c to E6.60 and Irish Life and Permanent was up 10c to 
E6.30. The latest ECB euro area bank lending survey covers conditions in the second quarter of this year and 
expectations for the third quarter. In a reversal of the recent trend, the results indicate somewhat lower net 
tightening of credit standards for two of the three categories, according to Davy Research. "In terms of outlook, 
economic worries have replaced concerns over the turmoil in financial markets, where banks expect access to 
wholesale funding to remain hampered to a similar extent as in the second quarter," said analyst, Niamh Hore. 
Elsewhere, packaging giant, Smurfit Kappa dominated corporate news after it announced higher second-quarter 
pre-tax profit and revenues. Chief executive Gary McGann said it will deliver current market expectations for 2008, 
even though it expects conditions to remain challenging for the rest of the year. Davy has a full-year core earnings 
forecast of E938m for the group, a position, it says, it will not change after today's results. Shares in Smurfit Kappa 
surged by nearly 7pc or 31c to E4.82. Ladbrokes plc has announced two corrections to its interim results for the half

declined by 4.4pc. Shares in Irish listed bookies, Paddy Power, slumped by more than 5pc on the news or 90c to 
E16.50. Shares in CRH rose by 68c to E19.08, Grafton was up 13c to E4.10, Kingspan gained 16c to E7.16 and 
McInerney edged up 1c to E0.36 despite further evidence of the slowing Irish construction market with the Ulster 
Bank Construction Purchasing Managers' Index for July showing that activity has slowed for the 14th month in a 
row as new business dropped at a record rate. Shares in Ryanair surged by 20c to E3.01 as oil prices continued to 
fall.

Ryanair Holdings is aiming to increase its pretax profit to about 900 million euros by 2012, chief executive Michael 
O'Leary told WirtschaftsWoche in an article to be published on Monday.
'I have said that we're probably making a loss (in the current financial year), given that airfares are falling and oil 
remains expensive. But even then, we (have) 2.2 billion euros of cash and we will hike profit before taxes to about 
900 million euros by 2012,' he was quoted as saying.
Ryanair in late July warned it could make a full-year loss of up to 60 million euros if oil prices stayed high and fares 
fell.
To further trigger growth, O'Leary said that the company will lower prices by up to 5 percent per year, while aiming 
to double passenger numbers, its fleet as well as profits by 2012, WirtschaftsWoche said.

Airports separation doubtful: O'Leary

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has expressed doubts about whether the government will now go ahead 
with the full separation of Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports.
This is despite the completion of a deal on debt levels at Cork Airport, which was seen as a final obstacle to the 
plan.
O'Leary has been a strong advocate of the plan for full separation, but said what is on the table now is radically 
different to the original idea proposed by former transport minister Seamus Brennan five years ago.
''Seamus Brennan's idea was to have Cork and Shannon airports debt-free, and for Aer Rianta International (ARI) 
to remain with Shannon. But Dublin has nicked all the assets of the group," he told The Sunday Business Post.
Cork and Shannon airports have submitted their business plans to Dublin and the Minister for Transport. However, 
an overarching document is to be sent by the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) at the end of the month, which will be a 
key factor in the government's decision about whether to proceed or not.
Tadhg Kearney, a member of the Shannon Airport Authority Board, said it would only be fair if the chairpersons of 
both Cork and Shannon airports were involved with the preparation of that final document.
He said Shannon would argue strongly that the ownership of ARI duty-free operations and other assets of the 
former Aer Rianta group be up for discussion.
The debate comes four years after the government passed legislation allowing for the full separation to go ahead. 
But there has been strong speculation in recent weeks that, in the current climate of cutbacks and aviation industry 
uncertainty, the government may postpone full separation and retain existing arrangements.
Kearney said this would not be acceptable to Shannon, as the current structure is designed as a temporary one.
Airports separation doubtful: O'Leary
O'Leary believes there are question marks over the viability of Cork and Shannon as standalone airports, as Dublin 
is retaining the bulk of the wealth of the former group.

Challenging the consensus on your pension scheme
Challenging the consensus on your pension scheme

Section: THE MARKET
Length: 963 words
Body
To the majority of pension scheme members, retirement is a long way off, and they have much more interesting and 
immediate preoccupations.
This may explain why about two-thirds of those given a range of investment choices end up with the ''default'' 
option. This is the investment choice chosen by the trustees for those who do not wish, or do not feel able, to 
choose for themselves.
By far the most common default option being used is a consensus fund in which large numbers of scheme 
members are now invested. This article seeks to challenge the pre-eminence of consensus as the default choice in 
pens ion schemes.
What is a consensus fund? Essentially, it is another form of managed fund - it aims to deliver mid-table 
performance by following the asset distributions of the various managed funds. In each market it seeks to achieve 
the performance of the index. Through having a slightly lower fee the consensus fund can be expected to beat the 
average over time.
The managed funds which consensus funds track generally operate with a commitment to equities (shares) of 6085 
per cent, though the average rarely moves lower than 70 per cent or above 80 per cent, with the residue in bonds, 
property and cash. Heretofore, there has been little or no investment in any other asset classes with very little use 
of options or futures.
So what's wrong with managed/ consensus funds?
* Not diversified enough; too conservative Managed funds became commonplace dur ing the 1980s when the 
unshakeable belief in equities completely took over.
Challenging the consensus on your pension scheme
Their average commitment to equities has moved within a relatively narrow range of 67-80 per cent for many years. 
For one reason or another these funds did not stray very much from what they were doing 15 years ago despite the 
possibilities which opened up to invest in other asset classes and use new investment instruments.
* Too much tied up in Irish equities For many years, holdings of Irish equities have been very high (20 per cent or 
so) - as a market dominated by banks and with big weightings in individual stocks, this was an accident waiting to 
happen.
Unfortunately, the credit crunch and economic slowdown nobbled the banks, high oil prices hit Ryanair, and Tysabri 
decimated Elan. With the latter comprising 17 per cent of the ISEQ at the end of June, its collapse took about 1 per 
cent off the value of consensus funds. The 42 per cent fall in the ISEQ over the last year has hit Irish pension funds 
very hard.
* Management by peer group The fact is that managed funds are managed by reference to the peer group. Good 
rankings in the performance tables are vital to win and retain business. Managers demonstrate very little willingness 
to deviate from the average precisely because of the business risks.
Members of defined contribution (DC) pension schemes (who bear all the risk) expect that fund managers will take 
more decisive action to earn them a return, particularly when markets are at extremities of strength or weakness.
They would be surprised to learn that fund managers who have lost money, or failed to out-run inflation, may have 
maxed out on bonus - as indeed they could if positioned well in the performance tables!
The DC scheme member does not take a 20-year view, and is focused on absolute return - if more (or, indeed, 
any?) thought had been given to what is so different about DC, a quite different type of ''managed'' fund should or 
would have been developed.
The performance issue It would be wrong to write about managed/consensus funds without referring to 
performance - that, after all, is what people pay for. While excuses are plentiful, the fact is that the last ten years 
have seen a singular failure to deliver.
Over the last ten years, the Irish Life Consensus Fund has returned 3.2 per cent per annum, ranking it 4th of 14 
(Hewitt survey to June 30, 2008). Even though well ahead of the average managed fund, Consensus did not keep 
pace with price inflation (3.8 per cent) over that decade.
It must be acknowledged that performance measured over 15 or 20 years would be very acceptable. However, ten 
years of failing to beat inflation is hard to excuse, and presents a very serious challenge to the whole concept of 
''mainstream'' investing and pension funding.
Are better choices available? The arrival of ''lifestyle'' funds has been positive, even though they often have 
managed/consensus funds embedded within. They at least start by acknowledging that the money belongs to a real 
person, whose ability to withstand investment risks changes over time.
The more recently-arrived ''diversified'' funds are definitely a step in the right direct ion. However, they will struggle 
to gain acceptance in what is a very conservative market, unless they are endorsed with conviction by the pension 
consultants.
Within larger DC schemes, the obvious development is to present choice by reference to risk (this can be over-laid 
with ''lifestyle'') and using lower cost passive vehicles where possible. With each choice no longer associated with a 
named provider and identifiable in a survey, the extraordinary emphasis on relative (and short-term) performance 
which has bedevilled the pensions scene should be considerably diluted.
Conclusion Managed funds, as we know them, should almost certainly never have become so ubiquitous in the DC 
arena. The derivative consensus carries the same basic flaws, allayed slightly by delivery of mid-table performance. 
While there may still be a place for consensus as part of the range of choice, superior alternatives exist - and more 
are emerging for use as the default option.

Our culture of short-term fixes is in stark contrast to the German model of creating systems and making them work.
With all of the current talk about the Sarkozy visit, the Lisbon Treaty and EU institutional reform one can easily 
forget about the biggest factor that has contributed to European integration in recent years. That factor is cheap air 
fares.
It is now as cheap, or cheaper, to fly to many cities in Europe as it is to take the train from Dublin to Kerry. A trip out 
to Dublin Airport at five o'clock any morning will reveal a human anthill of activity as cars, taxis and buses deposit 
thousands of passengers for the airport's early-morning rush. The biggest contributor to change in this area has 
undoubtedly been Ryanair.
Some German friends were recently holding a christening deep in the Black Forest. The Ryanair fares were cheap. 
After a torrid few months in the Backroom, we felt like a break away. So we ended up setting off on a Friday 
afternoon.
We left the crowded, cool and newly built departure area of Dublin Airport and arrived, two hours later, at a warm 
and humid Karlsruhe/ Baden-Baden airport. It's a small, cheap and informal setup, not unlike Knock Airport.
It used to be a base for the Canadian Air Force. Now, like many of these former Nato and Warsaw Pact airports, it 
is experiencing a renaissance by hosting cheap commercial flights.
Having collected our rental car, we set off on the motorway southward bound. When it comes to speed limits on 
roads, forget any self-regarding notions that the Germans are inflexible and we are Irish are the champions of 
pragmatism.
On most autobahns, there is no upper speed limit, in contrast to Ireland with our 120 kph limit. At the opposite end 
of the scale, the Germans impose a 30kph limit when one is driving through residential estates, whereas we have a 
general 50kph limit in such areas. This is an area where we could profitably learn from the Germans.
We must learn what we can from our Teutonic neighbours
It was noticeable that the quality of the once-famed autobahns has dropped considerably. It was a surprisingly 
bumpy ride on one of Germany's most important motorways, linking the Ruhr and the Rhein-Main area around 
Frankfurt to Switzerland. By contrast, the ride on our own new motorways is generally very smooth.
After a quick drive, we arrived at our destination. Our hotel was down-market but pleasant and clean. There 
seemed to be just three people doing nearly all of the work: the owner, his wife and a waitress.
There were no eastern Europeans on the staff. The layout of the main reception area looked like it hadn't changed 
since the 1980s, or even earlier. It cost each of us  35 per night, including breakfast.
When we got up the following morning, I took our three-year-old out for a walk to the town centre. We soon found 
an excellent and well-equipped children's playground. Nearby, there was also a small outdoor museum marking the 
historic practice in the area of using rafts to transport bound timber downriver.
This museum featured a mini-zoo with various rabbits and birds. These public facilities, in a town of about 6,000, 
clearly exceeded what would be available near the centre of an Irish town of similar size, such as, for example, 
Westport. Furthermore, there was little evidence of any vandalism of public facilities or of graffiti disfiguring them.
Instead, on Sunday morning, the town was busy with groups of locals out walking or cycling. This gives rise to one 
of the greatest differences between the Germans and the Irish.
There is a moral seriousness to the Germans that we pragmatic and feckless Irish have lacked since we threw 
religion overboard. You see it in German political discussion - it's much more about big issues and less about 
personalities or soap opera.
You see it in the reduced space that tabloid newspapers have on their shelves and in the proliferation of 'serious' 
newspapers there. And you see it in the greater focus on systems and making them work. Here in Ireland, our focus 
is much more on short-term gain.
We've had a long decade of short-term gains. According to OECD data, Irish unit labour costs grew by over 40 per 
cent over the last decade. By contrast, in Germany, unit labour costs grew by less than 4 per cent over the same 
period.
Property prices boomed in Ireland over that decade; they stagnated in Germany. In the Black Forest town we were 
in, you can buy a 600 sq foot three-roomed apartment for  35,000.A similar-sized apartment in Letterkenny, for 
example, is on sale for  129,000.
Germany has spent the last decade tightening its belt and focusing on becoming competitive again. That's the 
challenge facing us for the next decade. And those who hold up the German model or the Swedish model as an 
answer to our problems must remember that our culture is very different from the ones in those lands. They are 
instinctive conformists; we are instinctively non-conformist.
What may work there won't necessarily work here. Mé féin isn't just a glib phrase - it's part of what we are.

From Mr Rajiv Dadlani.
Sir, Kevin Done ("O'Leary shows it is not yet the end for budget travel", August 2/3) argues that Michael O'Leary's 
"gamble on not taking out hedging protection as the oil price soared, in the belief that it would soon fall back, has 
come spectacularly unstuck".
But, has it? Airlines have no way of eliminating the impact of a permanent rise in the price of jet fuel. Hedging can 
provide only relatively short-term relief and, for Ryanair in particular, it would be a calculated risk to leave jet fuel 
unhedged. The question is: What do Ryanair's investors expect from the company? As long as Ryanair remains the 
lowest-cost operator with a wide cost advantage over competitors, investors should view Ryanair as more 
macroeconomic play - in terms of oil and currencies - than airline.
As such, investors should prefer that Ryanair not even attempt to hedge its jet fuel exposure. If the price of fuel 
falls, it is a lot of jam today. If the price of fuel rises, it is a lot more jam tomorrow: because investors will own a 
business that is even bigger in future - as Ryanair crowds out conventional carriers.
For dollar bears, Ryanair offers also a currency play. The airline's costs - fuel and aircraft - are primarily in dollars, 
but its income is almost entirely in euros and sterling. So if one has to chastise Mr O'Leary, it should be because he 
succumbed to hedging Ryanair's fuel exposure at all - not because he didn't.

Michael O'Leary, chief executive of low-cost airline Ryanair <RYA.I>, said the company is interested in launching a 
takeover bid for Stansted airport, The Daily Telegraph reported on Friday.
A Ryanair spokeswoman declined to comment.
O'Leary told the newspaper that he was convinced the UK Competition Commission's investigation into Stansted-
owner BAA, which is controlled by Spain's Ferrovial <FER.MC>, would recommend breaking up the airports 
operator, which would open the door for a bid of around 2 billion pounds ($3.9 billion).
'While we believe the break up of BAA would improve competition and, therefore, benefit airlines, a Ryanair bid 
would likely come under microscopic scrutiny from a competition perspective, as it is Ryanair's largest base,' 
Goodbody Stockbrokers analyst John Goode said.
O'Leary also said that he would increase passenger numbers from 24 million to 40 million by halving landing fees 
and building a second runway and terminal.
The move comes after BAA this week started legal action against the airline after it refused to pay a 15 percent 
increase in landing charges at the airport, which is its biggest base.

The Dublin market made steady headway this morning with Ryanair up by 5.5pc amid rumours that it is considering 
buying Stansted Airport.
By midday, the ISEQ was up by 32.90 points to 4,405.06.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of low-cost airline Ryanair, said the company is interested in launching a takeover 
bid for Stansted airport. O'Leary told the Telegraph newspaper in the UK that he was convinced the UK Competition 
Commission's investigation into Stansted-owner BAA, which is controlled by Spain's Ferrovial, would recommend 
breaking up the airports operator, which would open the door for a bid of around #2 billion.
That - together with falling crude oil prices - helped to push the airline's shares up by 5.5pc or 14c to E2.68. Shares 
in Aer Lingus edged down 1c to E1.51. In the banking sector, RBS was the focus of attention. At an underlying level 
(which excludes credit market write-downs amongst other items), the group has recorded pre-tax profits of #5.1 
billion, which compares to consensus estimates of #4.9 billion and represents a 3pc decline on last year. Ulster 
Bank recorded a contribution to its parent that rose by 8.4pc compared to the first half of last year but was down 
1pc on a constant currency basis as the economic slowdown takes its toll. Shares in AIB rose by 3c to E8.58, Bank 
of Ireland gained by 7c to E6.03, Anglo Irish climbed by 9c to E6.20 while Irish Life and Permanent declined by 4c

The Dublin market made steady headway this morning with Ryanair up by 5.5pc amid rumours that it is considering 
buying Stansted Airport.
By midday, the ISEQ was up by 32.90 points to 4,405.06.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of low-cost airline Ryanair, said the company is interested in launching a takeover 
bid for Stansted airport. O'Leary told the Telegraph newspaper in the UK that he was convinced the UK Competition 
Commission's investigation into Stansted-owner BAA, which is controlled by Spain's Ferrovial, would recommend 
breaking up the airports operator, which would open the door for a bid of around £2 billion.
That - together with falling crude oil prices - helped to push the airline's shares up by 5.5pc or 14c to E2.68. Shares 
in Aer Lingus edged down 1c to E1.51. In the banking sector, RBS was the focus of attention. At an underlying level 
(which excludes credit market write-downs amongst other items), the group has recorded pre-tax profits of £5.1 
billion, which compares to consensus estimates of £4.9 billion and represents a 3pc decline on last year. Ulster 
Bank recorded a contribution to its parent that rose by 8.4pc compared to the first half of last year but was down 
1pc on a constant currency basis as the economic slowdown takes its toll. Shares in AIB rose by 3c to E8.58, Bank 
of Ireland gained by 7c to E6.03, Anglo Irish climbed by 9c to E6.20 while Irish Life and Permanent declined by 4c 
to E6.14. Shares in CRH jumped by 31c to E17.30. Davy Research pointed out that its peer, Martin Marietta

The Dublin market put in a volatile day's trading with Ryanair up by 5.5pc amid rumours that it is considering buying 
Stansted Airport.
At the close, the ISEQ was up 140.90 points to 4,513.06.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of low-cost airline Ryanair, said the company is interested in launching a takeover 
bid for Stansted airport. O'Leary told the Telegraph newspaper in the UK that he was convinced the UK Competition 
Commission's investigation into Stansted-owner BAA, which is controlled by Spain's Ferrovial, would recommend 
breaking up the airports operator, which would open the door for a bid of around £2 billion.
That - together with falling crude oil prices - helped to push the airline's shares up by an impressive 11pc or 28c to 
E2.82. Shares in Aer Lingus edged up 5c to E1.57. The market also received a boost from news that oil prices fell 
below the USD116 mark for the first time in over three months and as the euro eased significantly against the US 
dollar on fears that the eurozone could slip in to a technical recession before this year is out. In the banking sector, 
RBS was the focus of attention. At an underlying level (which excludes credit market write-downs amongst other 
items), the group has recorded pre-tax profits of £5.1 billion, which compares to consensus estimates of £4.9 billion 
and represents a 3pc decline on last year. Ulster Bank recorded a contribution to its parent that rose by 8.4pc 
compared to the first half of last year but was down 1pc on a constant currency basis as the economic slowdown 
takes its toll. Banking shares, after initial losses to profit taking, gained ground in the after noon to help keep the 
index above water. Shares in AIB rose by 29c to E8.84, Bank of Ireland gained by 10c to E6.06, Anglo Irish climbed 
by 25c to E6.36 while Irish Life and Permanent managed a gain of just 2c to E6.20. Shares in CRH soared by 
E1.41c to E18.40. Davy Research pointed out that its peer, Martin Marietta reported second quarter earnings per 
share of USD1.52, which fell short of the street's estimate of USD1.84. However, importantly from a CRH 
perspective, the pricing environment remains strong and Martin retained its aggregates pricing guidance of 6-8pc 
ISEQ closes the week on a major high ISEQ Up
for the current year. Still among the building related stocks, shares in insulations firm, Kingspan, rose by 20c to 
E7.00 despite data on new orders in the construction industry in the UK for June and the second quarter of 2008 
released yesterday. The figures back up the view that trading conditions for the UK building materials sector are 
getting worse. Overall Q2 new construction order volumes were down 21pc on the same period in 2007. Motor 
insurance premiums continue their slow upward trend, up 0.6pc month-on-month according to July CPI data. There 
have now been six consecutive months without further premium cuts. "This gives further credibility to what we have 
been hearing from the industry, that cuts have come to an end and there have been some recent price increases," 
Davy's Stephen Lyons said. Shares in insurance group, FBD, dropped by 5c to E16.80 with investors hoping rising 
premium costs will boost overall group revenues. Shares in Smurfit Kappa rose by 22c to e4.51 ahead of its interim

Goodbody Stockbrokers analyst John Goode said. O'Leary also said that he would increase passenger numbers

after BAA this week started legal action against the airline after it refused to pay a 15 percent increase in landing

Sharman as Chairman of Aer Lingus.
The former state airline is still looking for a suitable candidate to succeed Englishman Sharman now that financier 
Dermot Desmond has ruled himself out.
Paddy Power have listed a number of potential businessmen who could fit the bill. Former Bank of Ireland Chief Pat 
Molloy is the second favourite at 6/1, followed by leading entrepreneur Denis O'Brien at 8/1. BA Chief Willie Walsh 
is an unlikely 33/1 to return to the airline in Dublin, while controversial Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and former

Sharon McHugh, spokesperson for Paddy Power said: "Aer Lingus have made it quite clear they're looking for a 
heavy weight business man to replace John Sharman. With Desmond now out of the picture, the position and the 
betting is virtually wide open."

Fraport AG.'s chief executive Wilhelm Bender said recent strikes by workers at Deutsche Lufthansa AG. likely had a 
negative impact on July passenger numbers.
It is not yet clear how severe the impact was, he told analyst during a telephone conference.
Members of Lufthansa's ground and cabin crews at the end of last month staged a strike to push for higher wages, 
which grounded several planes and led to hundreds of flight cancellations.
When the German flag carrier last week came to an agreement with services union Ver.di, it said it will take up to 
two weeks until its flight schedule returns to normal, due to a backlog of planes needing maintenance.
But Fraport still expects the number of passengers handled at Frankfurt Airport, where Lufthansa is its biggest 
single customer, to advance between 1 percent and 2 percent in the full year.
Meanwhile, chief financial officer Matthias Zieschang said it will be a 'real challenge' to break even at Fraport's 
Hahn airport by 2010, as planned.
At Hahn airport, where planes of carriers including Ryanair operate, the number of passengers slid 5.8 percent in 
the first half of this year after Ryanair cut back its operations there and Wizz Air cancelled several flights.

Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings Plc. has been in talks with both Boeing Co and Airbus about aircraft purchases 
beyond 2012, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on Thursday.
'We've been trying to talk to Boeing about orders beyond 2012 but their prices are too high,' O'Leary told reporters 
in London.
'We've started talking with Airbus about the possibility of taking Airbus aircraft,' he added, although he said that 
Airbus prices were also too high. Ryanair's fleet currently comprises Boeing aircraft.
The likely size of the purchase would be 200 firm orders and options for an additional 200 planes, O'Leary said.

Ryanair is in talks with EADS unit Airbus and Boeing Co. to buy up to 400 aircraft to secure mid-term growth 
following its recent earnings slump, chief executive Michael O'Leary told Sueddeutsche Zeitung in an interview.
Planes are 'about half as expensive as they were a few years ago', he said, because of the currently weak U.S. 
dollar.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier last month said first-quarter net profit slumped 85 percent as its fuel costs soared, 
and warned it may post a full-year loss of up to 60 million euros if oil prices remain high.
'But the price will fall below $100 again because demand is declining,' O'Leary told Sueddeutsche. 'There is no oil 
shortage.'
However, if prices remain high, only between three and five European airlines will stay afloat in the longer term, 
among them 'Ryanair and maybe Easyjet', he said.
Airlines around the world have been merging with peers and buying shares in smaller rivals to boost their income in 
the face of surging fuel prices. Oil prices have risen 63 percent in the past 12 months and last month reached 
record levels above $145 per barrel.

BAA starts legal action over Ryanair fees
BAA starts legal action over Ryanair fees

Britain's dominant airport operator, BAA, said Tuesday it has started legal action over nonpayment of landing fees 
by Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's biggest budget airline.
Ryanair said in April that it would not pay the higher charges imposed by BAA at London's Stansted Airport, arguing 
they were excessive.
BAA, which is owned by Spain's Ferrovial SA, increased the fee levied on each departure or arrival at the airport by 
around 7 percent on April 1.
"This matter is in the hands of the lawyers so it is inappropriate to make any comment at this stage," BAA said in an 
e-mailed statement. "What we can say though is that for some time, Ryanair has enjoyed substantial discounts in 
charges for using Stansted Airport."
BAA said that those discounts had ended April 1, but added that the charges remained within the limits allowed by 
the Civil Aviation Authority, the industry regulator.
Ryanair said last month it will withdraw nearly a third of its aircraft from Stansted over winter because of high fuel 
costs and its failure to negotiate lower airport fees.
Ryanair is still collecting the increased fee from customers, but is holding the money in a separate account.
The carrier said that BAA's price increases this year have been "more than three times the rate of inflation and 
totally unjustified at a time when most other U.K. and European airports are reducing costs and charges."
"Ryanair will continue to oppose this regulatory rip-off," it added in a statement.

UK small caps closed higher, matching strong gains among the blue chips, with Ryanair Holdings soaring as it 
posted a surge in July passenger numbers.
At the close, the FTSE Small Cap index was 27.1 points up to 2,768.1, while the FTSE 100 index rose 134.3 points 
to 5,454.5.
Ryanair Holdings was a strong mover, up 0.37 of a penny to 2.59 -- or nearly 17 percent -- as it said it is confident 
that passenger traffic growth will stay strong, having posted a 19 percent rise in passenger numbers in July.
Minco rose 0-1/2 a penny to 3.125 as investors appeared to approve the appointment on two non-executive 
directors.
A positive update boosted marketing support services company Delling Group 0.2 of a penny to 1.625, as it said it 
expects to report a profit at EBITDA level for the first half of 2008, adding that trading has progressed satisfactorily.
In a similar vein, upbeat results from the Vicsani-1 well drove Aurelian Oil & Gas up 1 to 34, prompting Daniel 
Stewart and Fox David Capital to say 'buy'.
In contract news, Geong International stayed 5-1/2 up to 45-1/2, as it signed a contract extension worth 1.2 million 
pounds with a 'leading' global provider of next generation telecommunications networks.
Elsewhere, AEA Technology rose 5-1/4 to 47-1/4 as it confirmed it received valid acceptances of about 83.12 
percent following its 4-for-5 rights issue of 99.3 million shares announced on June 13.
And Chaarat Gold held on to its early gains, remaining 2 up at 36-1/2, on confirmation that it will begin more 
extensive drilling at the Chaarat project, after it found significant gold mineralisation at all nine holes it drilled at the 
contact zone of the mineral body.
But turning to the losers, and Top Ten Holdings slumped 20 percent to 3-1/2, down 0.875, as the bingo operator 
announced it had slipped to a full-year loss, with profitability hit by a 'challenging environment'.
Finally SDL dropped 8 to 338, continuing its slide from Monday after a strong run, despite news of a multimillion 
pound deal with HP.
The deal led to a string of 'buy' ratings from brokers and with Kaupthing upgrading its price target.

Air France-KLM <AIRF.PA> and Iberia <IBLA.MC> reported big drops in earnings on Tuesday as they suffered 
from an economic slowdown and higher fuel prices even though the cost spike was mitigated by the weaker dollar.
The French-Dutch airline, the world's biggest carrier by revenues, said first-quarter net profit fell 59.4 percent to 168 
million euros ($262 million), but still beat the average forecast from 15 analysts of 145 million euros.
Operating profit fell to 234 million euros from 415 million, in line with an analysts' average forecast of 231 million 
euros.
First-quarter sales were up 5.8 percent at 6.288 billion euros.
Air France-KLM confirmed its full-year objective of operating income in the order of 1 billion euros.
It said that 'in response to the new economic environment', it would reinforce its `Challenge 10' plan with an 
additional 190 million euros in cost-savings.
This would take the total for the financial year 2008-09 to 620 million euros as it wrestles with a fuel bill expected to 
rise to 5.86 billion euros.
Iberia posted a 32.2 million euro ($50.22 million) operating loss in the first half, worse than a forecast of a 25.7 
million euro loss from analysts polled by Reuters.
The Spanish company, which is in talks to merge with British Airways <BAY.L>, posted an operating profit of 69 
million euros a year earlier.
Its first-half net fell 72 percent to 20.7 million euros on flat sales of 2.67 billion euros.
The results come days after British Airways reported an 88 percent fall in quarterly pretax profit in what it called the 
worst-ever trading conditions.
Ryanair <RYA.I>, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, posted a 85 percent fall in net profit at the end of July and 
warned of a full-year loss if oil prices stayed high and fares fell.
Airline operators around the globe are struggling to stay profitable with the price of oil up some 60 percent over the 
past year. Many have shed jobs and are scrapping routes, while the weakest face the threat of bankruptcy.
WRAPUP 1- Air France - KLM net down 59 pct, Iberia makes loss
OIL BELOW RECORDS
Industry lobby group IATA estimates higher crude prices to add $91 billion to the global airline fuel bill and that jet 
fuel, at $141.9 per barrel, is up 75.5 pct from a year ago. Oil is currently below $120 a barrel, down from a record of 
$147 in mid-July. The fuel prices have worried airline investors, knocking 32 percent off Air France-KLM shares this 
year, giving it a market value of $7.6 billion.
Germany's Lufthansa <LHAG.DE> is worth $10.5 billion, BA $5.9 billion, Iberia <IBLA.MC> $2.9 billion and Italy's 
Alitalia <AZPIa.MI> $940 million.
Lufthansa last week stuck to its 2008 goal to match last year's operating result despite a series of headwinds after 
boosting first-half earnings by 45 percent.
U.S. airlines including United Airlines parent UAL Corp <UAUA.O>, US Airways <LCC.N> and JetBlue Airways 
<JBLU.O>, in which Lufthansa holds 19 percent, have all reported second-quarter losses, citing soaring fuel costs.
But All Nippon Airways Co Ltd (ANA) <9202.T>, Japan's second-largest airline, last week reported a 10 percent rise 
in quarterly operating profit on an uptick in international routes and as hedging cushioned the impact of high oil 
prices.
Air France KLM said its fuel bill rose to 1.36 billion euros from 1.09 billion euros a year earlier, a rise of 24.3 
percent.
This was due to a 3 percent rise in volume, an increase in jet fuel costs after hedging of 40 percent and after a 
favourable currency impact of 14 percent as the dollar weakened.
The group said that 'in response to the new economic environment', it would reinforce its `Challenge 10' plan with 
an additional 190 million euros in cost-savings.
This would take the total for the financial year 2008-09 to 620 million euros. It said the fuel bill for the full year is 
estimated at 5.86 billion euros.

News In Brief
## Forty six per cent of Irish people expect their income to rise over the next 12 months, according to a survey by 
Halifax. The research, done by Amarach Consulting, shows the optimism is highest among men, 25- to 34-year-
olds and people living in Dublin. Up to 55pc of those in the high-earning, ABC1, bracket expect a salary hike in the 
next year as do nearly 60pc of 25- to 34-year-olds. Despite constant warnings that we have borrowed too much, 
there appears to be little worry about debt burden with just 24pc of those questioned saying they worry about the 
amount of debt they have built up. The survey shows that there is more concern about the economy among the 
middle-aged. Up to 40pc of 45 to 54-year-olds say they feel less confident about their financial situation this year 
than they did last year. - Irish Examiner
## RYANAIR is facing a lengthy court battle as the British Airport Authority confirmed it had begun legal action 
against the airline over its refusal to pay a 15pc increase in airport charges at London's Stansted Airport. Just days 
after the airline confirmed it could rack up losses of E60m by March 2009 and 1.3bn euro was wiped off the 
company's value, a spokesman for BAA confirmed it had begun a High Court action against the airline. The court 
action is the latest twist in a long-running dispute between Ryanair and the UK airport manager over charges at 
Stansted, which is the main hub for the airline. Ryanair informed BAA in writing in May of its decision to withhold the 
increase, after the charges went up on April 1 this year. Ryanair has lodged a complaint against the BAA with the 
British Competition Commission, which is carrying out a review of Standsted's charges and has also written to the 
US Securities and Exchange Commission, accusing the BAA of "excessive pricing" and abusing its dominant 
position "contrary to the public interest". - Irish Independent
## A government equity loan scheme of up to 30 per cent of the price of a new home should be introduced for 
qualified first-time buyers, the Affordable Homes Partnership has said. It said that the credit situation for first-time 
46pc of people expect wage rise this yr; News In Brief
buyers had dramatically worsened in the last eight weeks, with some banks and building societies demanding 20 
per cent of the purchase price of new homes as a deposit. The homes partnerships believes that an equity loan 
scheme would help first-time buyers who cannot raise the large deposits currently being demanded by the banks. - 
Irish Times ## A major US healthcare company is in talks about setting up an Irish research centre in Ireland. 
UPMC, which is already operating the Beacon Hospital in Dublin, has held discussions with IDA Ireland and 
Science Foundation Ireland about developing a m=biomedical and biotechnology facility here. - Sunday Business 
Post ## A government-commissioned audit has reportedly found that the HSE is wasting more than E20m-a-year 
through bad financial management. Reports this morning say the study found that millions of euro is being lost 
because the health service's bank accounts are not earning interest, while the HSE is paying out around E2m-a-
year in bank charges. Wastage has also been found in the way claims are made to the VHI and in the processing of 
invoices. Elsewhere, the audit has also found that around 1,000 people are managing the HSE's finances, with 
many of them carrying out the same duties. - Irish Independent ## The corporate banking division of HSBC, 
Europe's largest bank, increased deposits by 40 per cent in the first six months of this year and its income by 30 per 
cent, as more Irish corporate customers availed of investment opportunities in Asia and the Middle East. Alan Duffy, 
HSBC's head of corporate banking in Ireland, said the bank had grown its Irish business as it has been seen by 
customers as "a corporate haven" amid the market turmoil. The HSBC group has, meanwhile, reported a 28 per 
cent fall in half-year group profits, warning that conditions in financial markets were at their toughest "for several 
decades". - Irish Times

scheme would help first-time buyers who cannot raise the large deposits currently being demanded by the banks. - 
Irish Times ## A major US healthcare company is in talks about setting up an Irish research centre in Ireland. 
UPMC, which is already operating the Beacon Hospital in Dublin, has held discussions with IDA Ireland and 
Science Foundation Ireland about developing a m=biomedical and biotechnology facility here. - Sunday Business 
Post ## A government-commissioned audit has reportedly found that the HSE is wasting more than E20m-a-year 
through bad financial management. Reports this morning say the study found that millions of euro is being lost 
because the health service's bank accounts are not earning interest, while the HSE is paying out around E2m-a-
year in bank charges. Wastage has also been found in the way claims are made to the VHI and in the processing of 
invoices. Elsewhere, the audit has also found that around 1,000 people are managing the HSE's finances, with 
many of them carrying out the same duties. - Irish Independent ## The corporate banking division of HSBC, 
Europe's largest bank, increased deposits by 40 per cent in the first six months of this year and its income by 30 per 
cent, as more Irish corporate customers availed of investment opportunities in Asia and the Middle East. Alan Duffy, 
HSBC's head of corporate banking in Ireland, said the bank had grown its Irish business as it has been seen by 
customers as "a corporate haven" amid the market turmoil. The HSBC group has, meanwhile, reported a 28 per 
cent fall in half-year group profits, warning that conditions in financial markets were at their toughest "for several 
decades". - Irish Times

The Dublin market started the week on a high with banks and Ryanair - big fallers last week - making headway.
By midday, the ISEQ index was up five percentage points or 202.35 points to 4,291.91.
The Irish index mirrored European bourses where banks led the rally after strong interims from Societe Generale 
and Standard Chartered and oil fell to a three month low at USD118 a barrel.
However, this week is a crucial one in terms of Irish economic indicators with all eyes on Thursday's ECB meeting 
on interest rates, seven month figures from the Exchequer and July housing starts. Tax data tomorrow for the 
period to July will track the deterioration in tax revenue since June. That arithmetic will ultimately have implications 
for how close the country will come to breaching the EU deficit limit in 2008. Tax revenue is set to miss target by as 
much as E4bn in 2008. "Despite the government's budget tweaks a month ago, we still think it will be very close to 
breaching the 3pc limit this year," according to Davy Research. Looking at the declining housing market, Premier 
Guarantee, which provides about 20pd of the new house bond figures, hit a new all-time low in July and were down 
93pv year-on-year. Meanwhile, an article from formal Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, predicting 
further bailouts for banks and financial institutions by governments before the credit crisis is over. According to 
Greenspan, this 'insolvency crisis' will only end when house prices in the US begin to stabilise. Following its 14.7pc 
fall in June, the ISEQ shed a further 16.1pc in July - bringing its two-month loss to 28.4pc. The only time the index 
suffered a greater two-month fall was in November 1987, when the market lost 41.2pc. Elan's 38.9pc decline made 
a significant contribution to the ISEQ's fall in July. Excluding Elan, the ISEQ's loss is reduced to 12.1pc. Financials 
continue to drag on the market, with the ISE financials index falling 13.8pc. Irish financials are now over 50pc below 
where they started the year. Revisions continued to be in a downward direction, and growth for 2008 and 2009 is 
now forecast at -11.1pc and -4.3pc respectively. The three-month rolling average of upgrades to downgrades is 
0.3x compared to 1.4x in July 2007. CRH, Kingspan and Paddy Power continue with their buyback programmes. "In 
ISEQ starts crucial week on a high ISEQ Rises
aggregate, we now estimate that Irish corporates have spent in the region of E470m repurchasing their stock in 
2008," said Davy. Irish banks surged in morning trade today with AIB up 47c to E8.47, Bank of Ireland climbed by 
45c to E5.81, Anglo Irish gained 43c to E5.50 and Irish Life and Permanent was up 36c to E5.79. CRH was also 
among the morning's top gainers with the building materials giant rising by 78c to E16.93. Heidelbergcement, a 
European peer of CRH, has announced results for the six months ended June 2008. Group turnover increased by 
66pc to E6.93 billion due primarily to the inclusion of Hanson. Excluding exchange rates and consolidation effects 
turnover increased by 9.2pc. Ryanair shares gained from bargain hunting after last week's slump with the stock up 
33c to E2.58. Air France-KLM has reported first quarter results today. Operating income was down 43.6pc to 
E234m while net income slipped 59.4pc to E168m. These results were achieved despite an increase of E266m in 
the fuel bill. Despite the slowdown in global growth and the increase in fares, designed to absorb some of the rise in 
fuel prices, passenger traffic activity was up 3.7pc with load factor of 80.3pc. Aer Lingus stocks rose by 15c to 
E1.56.

The Dublin market started the week on a major high with banks and Ryanair - big fallers last week - making strong 
headway and with the index jumping by nearly 8pc.
The index climbed by 326.47 points to 4,416.03.
This week is a crucial one in terms of Irish economic indicators with all eyes on Thursday's ECB meeting on interest 
rates, seven month figures from the Exchequer and July housing starts.
Tax data yesterday from the Exchequer showed that the State is well on the way to an E4 billion deficit by 
Christmas. That arithmetic will ultimately have implications for how close the country will come to breaching the EU 
deficit limit in 2008. "Despite the government's budget tweaks a month ago, we still think it will be very close to 
breaching the 3pc limit this year," according to Davy Research. Looking at the declining housing market, Premier 
Guarantee, which provides about 20pc of the new house bond figures, hit a new all-time low in July and were down 
93pv year-on-year. Last month proved another very difficult one for the Dublin market. Following its 14.7pc fall in 
June, the ISEQ shed a further 16.1pc in July - bringing its two-month loss to 28.4pc. The only time the index 
suffered a greater two-month fall was in November 1987, when the market lost 41.2pc. Elan's 38.9pc decline made 
a significant contribution to the ISEQ's fall in July. Excluding Elan, the ISEQ's loss is reduced to 12.1pc. Financials 
continue to drag on the market, with the ISE financials index falling 13.8pc. Irish financials are now over 50pc below 
where they started the year. Revisions continued to be in a downward direction, and growth for 2008 and 2009 is 
now forecast at -11.1pc and -4.3pc respectively. The three-month rolling average of upgrades to downgrades is 
0.3x compared to 1.4x in July 2007. CRH, Kingspan and Paddy Power continue with their buyback programmes. "In 
aggregate, we now estimate that Irish corporates have spent in the region of E470m repurchasing their stock in 
2008," said Davy. Shares in Elan rebounded by 39c to E7.63. Irish banks surged, with AIB up 47c to E8.47, Bank of 
Ireland climbed by 45c to E5.81, Anglo Irish gained 43c to E5.50 and Irish Life and Permanent was up 36c to E5.79. 
ISEQ surges 8pc after July slump; ISEQ
CRH was also among the top gainers with the building materials giant rising by 78c to E16.93. Heidelbergcement, a 
European peer of CRH, has announced results for the six months ended June 2008. Group turnover increased by 
66pc to E6.93 billion due primarily to the inclusion of Hanson. Excluding exchange rates and consolidation effects 
turnover increased by 9.2pc. Ryanair shares gained from bargain hunting after last week's slump with the stock up 
33c to E2.58. Air France-KLM has reported first quarter results. Operating income was down 43.6pc to E234m while

Ryanair July passenger numbers up 19 percent, confident of passenger growth

Ryanair Holdings PLC said it was confident that passenger traffic growth will stay strong as it reported a 19 percent 
rise in passenger numbers in July.
The Dublin-based budget carrier said it carried 5.66 million people last month, compared with 4.76 million during the 
same month a year ago. The load factor, however -- which measures how full its aircraft were -- dropped by one 
percentage point to 89 percent.
Ryanair, which revealed an 85 percent drop in first-quarter profits last month due to the impact of soaring oil prices 
and the impact on air travel of the global economic downturn, said the figures proved that low fares travel was 
growing fast.
The airline's head of communications, Stephen McNamara, said: 'Ryanair's latest passenger figures show we are 
rapidly growing passenger numbers this year.
'The most significant thing about today's figures is that we carried over 15 million passengers in the last three 
months.'
Ryanair said passenger numbers in the 12 months to July were 54.19 million.

British airport operator BAA has started legal action against Irish airline Ryanair <RYA.I> over its refusal to pay a 15 
percent increase in charges at Stansted airport, Ryanair said on Tuesday.
Ryanair <RYA.L> said in April it would not pay the higher charges imposed by BAA, owned by Spanish firm 
Ferrovial <FER.MC>.
'We are going to fight the action', a Ryanair spokesman said. 'We don't think the fees are warranted.'
A spokeswoman for BAA could not immediately comment.
A BAA spokesman told the Irish Independent newspaper that the airport charges remained within the limit allowed 
by the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority.
'This matter is in the hands of the lawyers so it is inappropriate to make any comment at this stage,' the paper 
quoted the spokesman as saying.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, said last month it would cut winter capacity at Stansted, its busiest hub, 
due to high fuel prices and because the cost of using Stansted was too high.
Rival low-cost airline easyJet <EZJ.L> also said in April it wanted to withhold part-payment of price rises by BAA at 
Gatwick airport.

Companies make defensive moves
Output and jobs cut to slash costs
Body
European companies are preparing for a recession or sharp economic slowdown as they make a series of 
defensive moves ahead of tougher times at the end of the year.
Companies from carmakers to accountants are seeking to slash costs by cutting production or jobs, clamping down 
on perks and scaling back on hiring people.
"Our strategy is to freeze the non-essential - nonessential vacancies are not being filled, and we're saving on non-
essential overheads," said John Griffith Jones, chairman of KPMG in the UK and joint-head in Europe.
Gary McGann, chief executive of Smurfit Kappa, said the Irish packaging group had brought in a cost-cutting 
programme and refused to add extra capacity when prices were high. "It is fair to say it is the most difficult time we 
have been through," he said, adding that he foresaw a wave of bankruptcies and consolidation in his industry. "I 
think we are heading for recession and it will be deeper than many people think."
Carmakers, led by Italy's Fiat and Germany's Mercedes and BMW, are cutting production and eliminating shifts at 
factories while airlines such as British Airways and Ryanair are chopping flights. Companies from Siemens and 
Saint-Gobain in the engineering sector to Henkel in consumer goods and the Italian bank UniCredit have 
announced plans for job cuts.
All this comes as business confidence plunges, with the European Commission's sentiment index falling to its 
lowest level in five years. Second-quarter earnings of European companies are also suffering, although they are 
down less than some analysts forecast. Western European companies are performing worse than their US 
counterparts after about a quarter of results, according to Bloomberg data. ING, the Dutch bank, said its surprise 
European groups braced for slowdown
ratio of companies that had performed better than expected against those who did worse was minus 19 per cent for 
the eurozone, minus 9 per cent for the UK and minus 5 per cent for the US.
The gloom is not shared equally, with companies generally reflecting the mood in their countries.
But even relative optimists are watching the situation closely. Ad Scheepbouwer, chief executive of the Dutch 
telecoms group KPN, said he had yet to see a change in consumer or corporate spending in Benelux countries or 
Germany. But he added that the group received weekly reviews of data to see if there were declines. "The moment 
we will see a slowdown in revenue, we would upscale the cost reduction programme that we have," he said.
Mr Griffith Jones said KPMG was seeing a "boom" in its restructuring business and was still hiring for strategic 
posts but said he was "a bit of a bear" on the general economy.
The European economy grew 0.7 per cent in the first three months of the year, more than the US, but most 
economists forecast a slowdown in the second quarter.

Hirings, shifts and production scaled back
Body
Companies across Europe have begun to cut jobs, scale back production and reduce hiring to slash costs as they 
brace for a recession or sharp economic slowdown at the end of the year.
The defensive moves are being seen in businesses ranging from carmakers and airlines to accountants and banks.
"Our strategy is to freeze the non-essential," said John Griffith Jones, chairman of KPMG in the UK and joint-head 
in Europe. "Non-essential vacancies are not being filled and we're saving on non-essential overheads."
Mr Griffith Jones said KPMG was seeing a "boom" in its restructuring business and was still hiring for strategic 
posts but said he was "a bit of a bear" on the general economy.
Gary McGann, chief executive of Smurfit Kappa, said the Irish packaging group had recently brought in a cost-
cutting programme and had been careful not to add extra capacity after enjoying high prices last year.
"It is fair to say it is the most difficult time we have been through," he said, adding that he predicted a wave of 
bankruptcies and consolidation in his industry. "I think we are heading for recession and it will be deeper than many 
people think."

Second-quarter earnings of European companies are also suffering, although they are down less than some 
analysts predicted. Of those companies that have reported, western European companies are performing worse 
than their US counterparts, according to Bloomberg data.
ING, the Dutch bank, said its latest so-called "surprise ratio" of companies that had performed better than expected 
against those who did worse was minus 19 per cent for the eurozone; minus 9 per cent for the UK and minus 5 per 
cent for the US.
The gloominess is not shared equally, reflecting the country's economic mood. Irish, Spanish and British groups 
have been more downbeat than their German and Benelux counterparts.
But even the relative optimists are watching the situation. Ad Scheepbouwer, chief executive of Dutch 
telecommunications group KPN, said he had yet to see a change in spending in Benelux countries or Germany. But 
he added: "The moment we will see a slowdown in revenue, we would upscale the cost reduction programme that

The European economy grew 0.7 per cent in the first three months of the year, stronger than the US. However, 
most economists forecast a slowdown in the second quarter.

O'Leary claims Ryanair executive had his salary doubled by Aer Lingus
O'Leary claims Ryanair executive had his salary doubled by Aer Lingus

Aer Lingus doubled the salary of former Ryanair executive Sean Coyle to persuade him to become its new chief 
financial officer, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said last week.
Speaking after the no-frills airline reported an 85 per cent fall in first quarter profits, O'Leary told analysts that the 
departure of Coyle, who was previously Ryanair's head of revenue and pricing, was down to ''fairly simple reasons''.
Responding to a London-based analyst who asked whether Coyle's departure had been a factor in the airline 
reducing its guidance on future earnings, O'Leary said the move had ''nothing to do with our guidance''.
''He was getting paid double our money in Aer Lingus and there wasn't much opportunity for promotion [in Ryanair] 
for a year, and we understand that," said O'Leary. ''He was a guy in his mid-30s. I am not sure he went to the right 
place, but if I was in my mid-30s and somebody offered me double my money, I'd probably go too."
O'Leary said he wished Coyle well in his new role. ''I think he was a good guy, I am sorry to lose him, but I promise 
you we won't determine our data, our guidance, our airline's strategy, on the basis of one manager coming or going. 
We've had guys who have left us before."
Coyle resigned from Ryanair in June and will take up his new job with Aer Lingus next week. He will replace Greg 
O'Sullivan, who resigned as chief financial officer to become company secretary with the former state airline.

As the aviation industry faces a looming crisis, Irishmen are at the helm of four of the world's major airlines. Martha 
Kearns looks at the challenges now facing them.
It's 7.08 on Monday morning and the news from Ryanair is not good. The airline has released weak first-quarter 
results and chief executive Michael O'Leary warns that the company could lose up to EUR 60 million this year. By 
the end of the day almost EUR 1.1 billion has been wiped off the value of Ryanair's shares.
Just hours earlier, 17,000 air miles away in Mascot, a suburb of Sydney, another Irishman was the centre of 
aviation attention, but for different reasons. Alan Joyce was named chief executive of Australia's largest airline, 
Qantas - the first non-Australian to get the top job.
The timing of the announcement was not perfect, as the airline had been in the news all weekend after one of its 
747s was forced to make an emergency landing in Manila when a hole was ripped into its fuselage at 29,000 feet.
A day later in London, British Airways (BA) chief executive Willie Walsh announced that the airline was in talks with 
Spain's Iberia about a merger that would create Europe's third-biggest airline.
The news led to a rise in BA's shares, closing up 6 per cent on Tuesday. But the Dubliner had no time to celebrate 
as he prepared to reveal last Friday that profits collapsed in what BA described as the worst trading conditions it 
had ever experienced.
Meanwhile, Dermot Mannion was keeping his head down in his office at Dublin Airport. With Aer Lingus's half-
yearly accounts approaching next month, its chief executive has been keeping his counsel but maintaining a close 
eye on the rapid warnings, consolidations and appointments being made around him.
With the world aviation industry going through what was described by BA chairman Martin Broughton two weeks 
ago as ''perhaps the biggest crisis the aviation industry has ever known'', it is an interesting time for Mannion, 
Irish airline chiefs in eye of storm
O'Leary, Walsh and Joyce. The choices made by these leaders in their individual markets will be watched the world 
over.
However, with 25 airlines having gone into bankruptcy since late last year, they won't underestimate the enormity of 
the challenges facing them. As oil prices rise and consumer confidence dips, there are also battles to be fought with 
unions, safety concerns to be quelled and the race to be at the forefront of global consolidation.
''There is a confluence of factors that have come together in the airline industry to create possibly its biggest crisis 
ever," said Davy analyst Stephen Furlong. ''As well as the cost of oil, a weakening global economy has led to 
weakening corporate profits and consumer confidence.
''Also, there are manufacturers preparing to deliver large amounts of aircraft and equipment, ordered by airlines 
during the boom time, which will have to be paid for."
However, all four airlines are financially strong, according to Furlong. ''Are they going to be survivors? Yes," he 
said.
Crisis management is nothing new to Walsh. When he was at the helm at Aer Lingus, he announced 2,000 job cuts 
in 2001 after the company was haemorrhaging money following the September 11 attacks in the US.
And since he joined the British airline, things haven't been plain sailing. As well as the challenges being faced by 
his counterparts, he had to contain the debacle of the opening of Terminal 5 at Heathrow in March that resulted in 
chaos at the airport.
BA also has issues around increasing competition at its fortress Heathrow with the Open Skies agreement, which 
puts pressure on its dominance at the airport.
This has led to the company's merger talks with Iberia, which would give BA a fighting chance to compete against 
rivals Air-France-KLM and Lufthansa. The announcement came just four days after BA completed its EUR 68 
million purchase of French airline L'Avion.
''The merger [with Iberia], if it goes ahead, is an offensive move by BA and it was done out of necessity," said 
Furlong.
''They have to go down that road if they are going to compete in a global hub structure with the likes of Air France. 
They would have been left way behind if they did not do this. BA is going to be much stronger after this deal with 
Iberia."
On making the announcement, Walsh said that the aviation landscape was changing and that airline consolidation 
was long overdue.
BA acquired a 9 per cent shareholding in Iberia in 1999 and has recently increased its shareholding to 13.15 per 
cent. Iberia recently acquired a 2.99 per cent direct shareholding in BA.
However, it was not all good news for BA as it disclosed last Friday how far profits had fallen during the first quarter 
and how bad the outlook was for the rest of the year. It also announced capacity cuts for the winter season of 3 per 
cent as fuel costs soared by 49 per cent. The airline's pre tax profit for the three months was stg£37 million (EUR 
47 million) compared to stg£298 million (EUR 378million) for the same period last year.
''We are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced," said Walsh. He said BA's policy of hedging 
had mitigated the impact of high oil prices but he still expected its fuel bill to top stg£3 billion (EUR 3.8 billion) this 
year.
Talk of falling profits and bad outlooks was also on Michael O'Leary's lips last week. Ryanair said its fuel bill in the 
three months to the end of June rose by 93 per cent to EUR 367million - fuel now accounts for half of its operating 
costs.
Irish airline chiefs in eye of storm
This can be traced back to O'Leary's gamble late last year that oil prices would fall again in the short term and his 
decision not to hedge his fuel costs, as most other airlines did.
But instead of falling, prices reached record highs and, while other airlines were paying oil prices from the times 
they made their deal with suppliers, Ryanair's fuel bills continue to rise. The carrier has also scaled back its 
expectations for passenger growth this year from 16 to 14 per cent.
This is as a result of grounding 19 aircraft this winter, on the back of fuel prices and waning consumer demand.
However, Furlong said that, ironically, Ryanair could see its fortunes turn around next year in comparison to other 
airlines. The low-cost airline is taking the brunt of the oil prices now but other carriers, which are already suffering, 
will find that when their hedges run out over the next few years, they will face a major shock.
This could be the situation facing Mannion at Aer Lingus, but for now he will be counting his blessings that it chose 
to strike a deal when oil was relatively low.
However, he is in a better financial position than most chief executives. ''Even though it is a small airline, it is awash 
with cash," said Furlong.
''Aer Lingus has had bad press and it is in a challenging environment as the transatlantic market does seem to be 
very weak. But for a legacy airline, it has a strong liquidity. Dermot Mannion is doing a good job but it is in a 
challenging position."
So what about the new kid on the block? Joyce, from Tallaght, could have been in Mannion's shoes right now - it 
was rumoured that he was offered the job when Walsh left. Instead, he was celebrating his new job on the other 
side of the world.
Joyce has already assumed the role of chief executive designate and has joined the Qantas board. The former 
chief executive of Qantas subsidiary airline Jetstar is to take over from Geoff Dixon (who last week predicted the 
aviation industry would shed 100,000 jobs worldwide by the end of the year) when he steps down in November.
The announcement was made by Qantas chairman Leigh Clifford, who said Joyce was ''the best person to take 
Qantas forward in what is a very challenging environment''.
It might not have been perfect timing - with a second safety scare prompting its share price to fall 15 per cent on the 
day of the announcement - but then again, in the current climate, there might never have been a right time.
However, he was put on the offensive from the off, saying the second incident was routine and his staff were well 
trained to handle them.
''I think at the moment there's a bit more focus on Qantas because of the incident last Friday and that's to be 
expected," he said, adding that safety was a top priority at Qantas.
But his most immediate problem will be dealing with unions over cost-cutting measures, which caused rolling strikes 
by engineers last month, forcing the cancellation of dozens of flights.
The action was over Qantas's recently announced plans to axe 1,500 jobs and increase the amount of aircraft 
maintenance done outside Australia.
However, Joyce has already indicated that cutting costs might not be enough to keep the company viable and the 
airline might have to merge in the next few years.
''With the high fuel prices we have, if that continues, a lot of airlines are not economic if they stand alone," said 
Joyce, reflecting the feelings of his three counterparts.

Eirtight set for  1.5m turnover

A recently-established Irish technology firm is on course to generate turnover of  1.5 million in its first year in 
operation.
Eirtight Technology was set up earlier this year, when three existing Irish firms joined forces. The new company 
brings together web design firm Adrenalin Internet Systems, biometrics solution provider Byamsys and software 
firm Data and Business Integration (DBI).
John Beckett, commercial director of Eirtight, said it made sense for the three firms to come together as they had 
already been collaborating on projects.
He said the focus of the new firm was developing ''enterprise-level solutions'' to enable companies to use 
technology more efficiently.
Prior to establishing Eirtight with former DBI directors Kieran Dundon and Rob Hall, Beckett founded both Byamsys 
and Adrenalin Internet Systems. In late 2006, he was awarded the title of Shell Livewire Young Entrepreneur of the 
Year.
Beckett said all three firms still existed but had become part of the Eirtight group and would gradually be rebranded. 
He said the web design work was now an ancilliary part of the business, while biometrics was still an emerging 
technology and as such was not the main focus of the business at present.
Dundon is the managing director of the recently formed firm, while Hall serves as operations director.
Eirtight employs about 25 staff, with a development team of 15 staff based in Romania. Beckett said that staff 
numbers at the firm looked set to double by the end of 2009, with some of his colleagues having travelled to 
Romania last week to conduct interviews for development staff.
Eirtight set for  1.5m turnover
The company's technology is in growing demand, according to Beckett, as clients seek ways to cut costs in the face 
of worsening economic conditions. Beckett gave the example of a company using a sizeable Excel spreadsheet to 
manage holidays, sick leave and rosters.
''It is created by one person, e-mailed to someone else, modified, updated and continues to grow," he said. Over 
time he said this type of system became costly and ineffective and said Eirtight would develop bespoke software to 
provide an alternative solution.
Eirtight's biggest client is Dell, but it has already built up a base of more than 50 clients. Other customers include 
Ryanair, McInerney, Perlico and Digiweb.
The company's client base includes companies in Britain, the US and the Middle East. ''The focus is very much on 
the international side of the business,'' Beckett said.
Beckett said the average deal generated about  50,000 to  60,000 and said turnover was likely to reach at least  2 
million in 2009, based on existing contracts alone.
The company is owned by Beckett, Dundon and Hall and has been self-financing to date. Beckett said the firm had 
no immediate plans to seek funding, adding that the company would prefer to build up as much value as possible 
before it looked at venture capital or other funding options.
While biometrics is not the company's primary focus at present, Beckett said the technology would become more 
and more prevalent in the coming years.
The technology developed by Byamsys provided for access control to schools and workplaces.
Beckett said Eirtight had negotiated an agreement with a British firm to install its biometrics solution in 100 
educational institutions in Britain, beginning in October.

Comment: Merger of BA and Iberia is a sign of things to come

News of a possible merger between British Airways and Spanish airline Iberia could have more profound 
consequences for Irish air travellers than it might first appear.
The deal, if it goes ahead, will be the biggest airline merger in Europe since Air France and Dutch carrier KLM tied 
the knot some years ago.
It should not come as a surprise. The industry is currently toughing it out as slowing economies and higher oil prices 
squeeze profits - and, in many cases, magnify losses.
The long-running charade at Italian carrier Alitalia, which has been flirting with bankruptcy, rescue packages and 
Italian state aid for months, has shown the extent to which airlines are feeling the pain. Even Ryanair laid the 
ground for hefty losses when it revealed first-quarter results last week.
Amid the drive for consolidation in the industry, however, Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary's thoughts may be turning 
to the European Commission's opposition to his plan to acquire Aer Lingus. It is likely that O'Leary is already 
sharpening his pen in advance of issuing yet another tirade in the commission's direction.
How, after all, can it have approved Air France/KLM and go on to approve BA/Iberia, while at the same time 
standing in the way of his most audacious coup?
BA chief executive Willie Walsh, who developed a strong taste for being pragmatic when in the Aer Lingus hot seat, 
obviously has come to share O'Leary's view that consolidation is inevitable.
From Walsh's point of view, it is better to engage in the process voluntarily, at a time of his own choosing, instead of 
waiting for his hand to be forced by circumstances outside his control.
Neither he nor his counterpart in Iberia will get too upset about the implications for competition on routes between 
Britain and Spain, but they will be confident of satisfying any concerns the commission may have.
Comment: Merger of BA and Iberia is a sign of things to come
The members of the commission, however, will need to find a way to approve a deal that allows the top airlines in 
Britain and Spain to come together, while at the same time continuing to justify blocking a tie-up between the top 
two carriers in Ireland. O'Leary, though, is unlikely to make it easy for them.

O'Leary shows it is not yet the end for budget air travel

Is the era of cheap air travel ending? This week brought two typically contrasting answers. Willie Walsh, British 
Airways chief executive, insisted yesterday that fares must rise sharply to reflect higher fuel costs. Days before, 
Michael O'Leary, the iconoclastic boss of Ryanair, was placing a very different bet. Air fares were going to fall, he 
said, as he heralded the start of a new price war.
Mr Walsh, reporting an 88 per cent slide in first-quarter profits, said the industry must price $120-$140 a barrel oil 
into the business. In previous downturns, airlines would have quickly cut fares to try to fill more seats. "The old 
argument was that (with a little more passenger traffic) you cover the variable costs and contribute to the fixed 
costs. But that does not apply now." With fuel now making up 40-50 per cent of the industry's total costs, the 
variable cost was too high. So the medicine at BA is save costs where you can, rein in capital expenditure, take part 
in consolidation (the planned merger with Spain's Iberia), but most immediately reduce the number of daily services 
and push up prices as far as you dare on remaining flights. At the same time manage the fleet for maximum fuel 
efficiency and buy new aircraft to replace gas-guzzlers.
Try telling that to Mr O'Leary. While other airlines are forcing prices up, Mr O'Leary has grabbed yet again for the 
price lever to force prices down to fill his ever-growing number of aircraft and seats.
He is in a very different position to his fellow Irishman at BA, where short-haul flying accounts for only 20 per cent of 
capacity. Ryanair is 100 per cent in short-haul. It is the lowest-cost producer in the business. It has lots of cash and 
one of the strongest balance sheets. It also has by far the broadest spread of network and bases and therefore of 
market risk of any airline across Europe.
Mr O'Leary is gambling again that economic weakness will take many of his rivals to the wall or at least force them 
to shrink drastically. He will be there to come out of the downturn with a much bigger market share. In part he is 
locked into this strategy because of new aircraft deliveries coming his way, with deposits paid and penalties for 
pulling out. But he has used a similar strategy before to take advantage of other's woes.
"It is good to have someone like Michael O'Leary around," said Mr Walsh. "He scares people to death. And what he 
does and what he says are often very different. But Ryanair is an important competitor, and we treat it with respect. 
If I was in his position, I might well do the same."
O'Leary shows it is not yet the end for budget air travel
For all that he likes sometimes to dress up as St Patrick or the Pope, Mr O'Leary is far from infallible. His gamble on 
not taking out hedging protection as the oil price soared, in the belief that it would soon fall back, has come 
spectacularly unstuck.
But as long as he is the lowest-cost producer, he is likely to be the last man standing. It will be his actions, and 
those of his closest rival, the other big European low-cost carrier, EasyJet, that largely determine whether the era of 
low-fare air travel in Europe still has a way to run.
"The demise of low-fare air travel is again being predicted by high-fare airlines like BA and others who are still 
losing short-haul traffic to Ryanair," Mr O'Leary said this week. "Higher oil prices won't end low-fare air travel, it just 
increases the attraction of Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares. Higher oil prices will speed up the decline of high-fare 
short-haul travel this winter . . . Ryanair will lead this downward pricing at a time when most of our competitors are 
hoping to raise fares and fuel surcharges."
He has been as good as his word. At the beginning of the week he was reporting an 85 per cent fall in underlying 
net profits in his first quarter and forecasting a possible full-year loss. By Wednesday he was offering 1m 
"recession-busting fares inclusive of taxes and charges" across Europe. He followed that with an offer of 300,000 
seats in Germany for EUR3 ($4.68, £2.36) including taxes and charges, challenging a weaker rival, Air Berlin.
Already I hear your objections. What about all the extra charges - for baggage, check-in, for the use of a credit 
card? And do you really want to fly with Ryanair? The stampede to board the aircraft, the cramped leg room, the 
noise, the non-stop selling.
For many, the answer will be yes. But you have to accept the O'Leary contract. I need to get to the southern 
Scottish Highlands in mid-October. For weeks I have been trying to obtain one of the cut-price deals supposedly 
available to travel by rail on the overnight sleeper. Forget it. They are as elusive as the monster in the loch.
Yesterday morning I bought two Ryanair tickets from London Stansted to Glasgow Prestwick for £55.96, a lot less 
than it costs for a tank of diesel for our VW Golf. That was the total price, two people, all in, including all taxes and 
charges and including £16 as the credit card handling fee. Yes of course we will check in online, check in no bags, 
and each have only one carry-on bag weighing less than 10kg. And we will run to the plane. That is the O'Leary 
contract. But throw in the hire car and petrol, the train from Liverpool Street to Stansted (nearly half as much as the 
air fare) and there is still nothing to touch it. The return sleeper for two would have been £378.
Of course fuel prices are a severe threat to the low-cost airline business model in the longer term, but the 
suggestion that the era of low-fare air travel is over - at least in short-haul - is certainly premature.

(ANSA) - Bologna, August 1 - Irish low-cost air carrier Ryanair will invest $70 mln (45 mln euro) in an aircraft that 
will operate domestic flights from the airport of Forli, in the central Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, the company 
announced.
The company will make Forli its fourth biggest base in Italy as of March 2009. Ryanair will operate its domestic 
flights from Forli after moving its international flights to the Guglielmo Marconi international airport in the Italian city 
of Bologna, the main city of Emilia-Romagna.
The Irish low-cost carrier will invest in the new aircraft since it plans not to lose the current passenger traffic it has in 
Forli. The new aircraft will deliver 400,000 passengers per year and open 400 jobs in Forli. 
Forli will rank as Ryanair's fourth base after the airports of Ciampino, in Rome, Orio al Serio in Bergamo, northern 
Italy and the airport of Pisa, in central Italy. Ryanair's chief executive officer (CEO) Michael O'Leary announced the 
new agreements with the airports of Bologna and Forli at a news conference in Bologna on July 31, 2009.
The new ten-year agreement with Ryanair will secure the future of the airport of Forli, Franco Rusticali, president of 
SEAF, the company operating the airport, said.

Ryanair, the biggest European low-cost carrier, is expanding its presence in Italy by establishing two more 
operating bases at Bologna and Forli.
The airline is continuing to expand its operations in spite of the pressures from surging fuel costs and weakening 
economic growth in important markets.
It warned this week that it could fall into loss in the current financial year to March 2009 for the first time since it was 
floated 11 years ago. It is still expanding capacity ambitiously, however, albeit at a slightly slower rate than 
previously.
While it is reducing its flying programme at some airports for part of the coming winter season to reduce loss-
making operations - chiefly at London Stansted and Dublin - it is increasing its overall capacity in the winter by 8-9 
per cent following an expansion of 18-19 per cent during the current summer months.
Overall this year Ryanair is raising capacity by about 14 per cent, and in spite of softening consumer confidence is 
still forecasting a growth in passenger numbers from 51m in the past financial year to 58m in the current year to 
March 2009.
The airline has renewed a price war to try to stimulate traffic to fill extra aircraft coming into its fleet with firm orders 
with Boeing, which will see the fleet expand in 12 months from 163 to 195 jets by March next year.
Ryanair will start flying seven routes into Bologna from the end of October. It said it would establish an operating 
base at the airport in June 2010 with two aircraft, rising to five by 2012, when it forecasts that it will be handling 25 
routes and 2m passengers through the city.
A smaller base will be established at nearby Forli with one aircraft in March next year. Ryanair already has three 
bases in Italy.

Ryanair, the biggest European low-cost carrier, is adding two bases in Italy at Bologna and Forli, to its three existing 
centres.
It is continuing to expand its operations in spite of the pressures from fuel costs and weakening economic growth in 
key markets.
But it warned this week it could fall into loss in the financial year to March 2009 for the first time since it was floated

From Mr Nigel Morton.
Sir, The true pioneer of the budget airline model was not Michael O'Leary, as you suggest ("Ryanair chief seeks 
new ploys in effort to fly clear of trouble", July 29). This accolade must be accorded to Herb Keller, founder of South 
West, the Dallas-based airline. Indeed, when trying to turn around the then ailing fortunes of Ryanair, Mr O'Leary 
described viewing the South West business model as his "road to Damascus" moment.

The aviation malaise that has infected U.S. airlines appears to be spreading abroad.
Plagued with losses, some major airlines in India are considering deferring orders of new jets. India's largest airline 
by market share, Jet Airways (India) Ltd., said it is in talks with Boeing Co. to defer deliveries of two widebody 
Boeing 777s to next year from their planned handover in October.
Airbus, a unit of European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co., is urging Indian customers to reschedule deliveries in 
hopes of forestalling a capacity glut that could hobble customers long term and could eat into future jetliner 
demand. India, "has a great need for air travel," said John Leahy, Airbus's chief operating officer for customers. 
Now, he said, "there's too much capacity."
India has been seen as a long-term boom market for aircraft, but appears to be joining the U.S. at the vanguard of 
industry turmoil. Several U.S. airlines have deferred new-plane deliveries, but international orders have been 
generally regarded as more dependable.
Said Naresh Goyal, chairman of Jet Airways, "We are all in trouble."
Other markets and carriers generally considered better insulated are showing signs of weakness. High oil prices 
and softening economies have driven merger talks like those disclosed this week between British Airways PLC and 
Spain's Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA.
On Wednesday, Deutsche Lufthansa AG stuck to its financial forecast for the year but warned of tougher 
conditions. On Monday, Ryanair Holdings PLC posted its first quarterly loss as a public company.
Some industry observers are closely watching China, which saw passenger volumes fall in June for the second 
straight month. So far, China's airlines appear stable thanks to milder competition and government support, among 
other reasons.
The International Air Transport Association, an industry group, estimates that the global industry could lose as 
much as $6.1 billion this year if oil prices remain close to recent highs, with almost one-third of that coming from 
outside North America.
Woes of US airlines spread abroad
Airbus and Boeing still see India as a cornerstone of an expected Asian aerospace boom. Boeing said last week 
that it expects India will need 1,001 new aircraft, valued at $105 billion, by 2027.
But the rapid shift in the outlook for India's carriers shows how fast-moving developing markets can trip up 
industries, ranging from aerospace to autos to banking, that are counting on them for growth.
Boeing says it believes its backlog is in good shape in India, because it didn't market aggressively to start-up 
airlines that might be more prone to delaying deliveries. Like Boeing, Airbus says it believes India's air market will 
rebound and that delaying deliveries could help cushion the blow in the meantime.
Aviation executives and analysts figure that India's airlines together will lose $1 billion to $2 billion this year twice 
what they lost in 2007. "Airlines in India face an economic emergency," said Kapil Kaul, a consultant in New Delhi at 
the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation.
But the airlines often find lifelines. In mid-July, for example, U.S. investor Wilbur Ross said he had agreed to invest 
$80 million in SpiceJet Ltd. based in New Delhi. "Every time we think somebody is going out of business, boom-
somebody comes along and puts in cash," said Vijay Mallya, chairman and chief executive of India's Kingfisher 
Airlines Ltd. Kingfisher is now working with Airbus to spread out jet deliveries.
Industry players say that, as in the U.S., India needs more mergers and drastic cuts in capacity. Until recently, 
passengers flying between Mumbai and New Delhi were able to choose from among 50 flights a day. "There were 
four seats chasing each passenger," with some airlines offering "come-on fares" amounting to as little as $2, said 
Dinesh Keskar, Boeing senior vice president in charge of sales in India.
Hurt by rising fares, the number of domestic passengers in India rose by only 7 percent in the 12 months ended in 
April, according to the Airports Authority of India. The growth rate for the previous 12-month period was 31 percent, 
and in the 12 months before that, it was 59 percent. Airlines are cutting routes, idling planes and even taking coat 
hangers out of cabins to reduce weight.
One carrier, Air India, is curtailing domestic services by as much as 15 percent. It has decided to freeze the size of 
its fleet, offsetting planned deliveries of new aircraft by returning 14 leased jets to their owners as the leases expire. 
Jet Lite, a low-cost unit of Jet Airways, will begin charging next month for water and snacks.
India's biggest carriers are looking at more profitable business overseas. Kingfisher is pressing ahead with plans to 
launch flights this year to Britain and the U.S. However, it is now looking "quite critically" at the economics of its 
planned service from Bangalore to New York, Mr. Mallya said.
Jet Airways has added 12 international routes in as many months, most recently a unique service from Mumbai to 
San Francisco via Shanghai. It began flying in August to Newark, N.J., and it plans soon to begin service to Dubai 
and Saudi Arabia.
Jet Airways on Tuesday reported a surprise profit of 1.43 billion Indian rupees ($33.59 million) for the fiscal first 
quarter ended in June, up from 308.8 million rupees in the same period a year earlier. Industry watchers said the 
results benefited from a new accounting rule that lowered depreciation charges.

Irish shares slipped again today for their sixth straight session as drugs company Elan fell once more and banks 
struggled to hold on to gains from the previous session.
Elan dropped by another 85c to 1317, bringing its overall drop to 35pc since its negatively received update to a 
conference in Chicago this week on its experimental Alzheimer's drug.
The update provided initial test results that offered as many questions and answers, leaving the market confused.
A recovery in Elan shares now looks unlikely until this confusion can be cleared up, something that Ian Hunter of 
Davy Stockbrokers said today could "take some time". On the banking front it was a see-saw day with all four 
names on the Dublin market showing losses early on, but things brightening up later on. By tonight AIB had moved 
15c ahead for the session to 800, as the market continued to dissect details of its interim results from yesterday. As 
the first Irish bank to report half year figures, it was inevitable that AIB's results would be picked over carefully. After 
24 hours reflection, Emer Lang of Davy Stockbrokers said this morning that she was cutting her forecast again for 
the bank to reflect the increasing deterioration of the Irish credit sector. She has cut her eranings per share estimate 
for AIB ro 175c for the current year, falling further to 130c for next year and 110c in 2010. Bank of Ireland ended the 
session flat at 539, but Anglo Irish was still 34c lower at 525, while Irish Life and Permanent was down 7c to 508. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares ended its day 70.24 points down at 4,371.62. CRH shares dipped by 39c to 1640 
after its British peer Tarmac reported a 22pc decline in first half profits, reflecting difficult market conditions in the 
UK and Spain. The Irish building materials giant was seemingly not helped by reports from the US that it has bought 
Gemseal Inc., a manufacturer of asphalt pavement maintenance products. CRH was also reported earlier this week 
to have bought a new macadam mine in the Ukraine. Paddy Power slipped by 30c to 1800, despite results from its 
competitor William Hill that were slightly ahead of target. Davy analyst Liam Igoe said : "We view these results as 
positive for Paddy Power as the economic slowdown does not seems to be affecting the bookmaker business." 
ISEQ closes 70 points lower at 4,371 ISEQ Down 70
Grafton bucked the overall market trend with a 10c gain to 365. Its rise came after reasonably good results from its 
UK peer Travis Perkins, which augur positively for the Irish building materials' group's future performance. Other 
shares that defied the downward trend today included Tullow, which was 53c ahead at 1000, and FBD, up 45c to 
1500. Ryanair was flat at 248, with Aer Lingus lifting by 7c to 149. Kingspan was down 4c to 619 and Fyffes edged 
1c higher to 54. The mood on the Dublin market was not helped by falls on Wall Street in the afternoon on weaker 
growth figures for the US economy and higher jobs claims. Shares were lower in London as well.

Ryanair To Launch International Flights from Italy Bologna

(ANSA) - Bologna, July 31 - Irish low-cost air carrier Ryanair will start operating from the Guglielmo Marconi 
international airport in the Italian city of Bologna, from October, 27, 2008, the company's chief executive officer 
(CEO) Michael O'Leary announced at a news conference in Bologna.
Ryanair will operate international flights from Bologna, the main city of the northern region of Emilia-Romagna. The 
company will move its seven international connections from the airport of Forli, also in Emilia-Romagna, to Bologna. 
The seven flights include flights to Barcelona, eastern Spain, Dublin and London.
Ryanair will launch domestic connections from Forli.
The Irish low-fare carrier plans to invest $140 mln (89.7 mln euro) in the airport of Bologna. Thus the company aims 
to increase its passenger traffic there by two million people in five years.
The Bologna airport closed 2007 with a net profit of 498,000 euro ($777,500), ANSA reported on June 25, 2008. 
The passenger traffic registered a 1.9 pct annual rise in June 2008. The passenger traffic at Marconi remained flat 
on the year in the first six months of 2008.
Notes
According to the website of Ryanair www.rayanair.com, the new flights will increase the number of passengers at 
the Marconi airport by 800,000 passengers per year. This traffic will open 800 new jobs at first and it is expected the 
number to rise to more than 2,000 in 2012.

Deutsche Lufthansa AG. reported second-quarter results that were in line with expectations and affirmed its full-
year guidance, though analysts said surging fuel prices and ongoing strikes by workers may still hit the company's 
results.
Lufthansa earlier said it still expects full-year operating profit to exceed last year's level of 1.378 billion euros as it 
curbs spending in the passenger business, reduces its fuel consumption and hedges its fuel needs.
'Our forecasts are more cautious than company guidance,' said Merrill Lynch analysts in a note.
'We are forecasting a 20 percent decline in operating profit to 1.1 billion euros,' they said, adding they see a risk of 
slowing demand for air travel in the second half of this year as well as a possible impact by strikes.
Grounds crew and cabin crew workers launched strikes this week that have so far led to nine planes being 
grounded and nearly 150 flights being cancelled.
Chief financial officer Stephan Gemkow earlier told journalists he cannot yet assess how much the strikes will cost 
and what the impact on full-year earnings will be.
Talks between the airline and services union Ver.di, which represents some 48,000 of Lufthansa's workers, 
collapsed three weeks ago after the union rejected an improved offer of a 6.7 percent pay increase over 21 months, 
plus 1 percent of one year's annual salary for every worker.
The offer was 1.2 percentage points above the company's previous offer but below the 9.8 percent raise over 12 
months the union demanded.
Lufthansa said its second-quarter operating profit rose to 517 million euros from 450 million euros in the year-earlier 
period, slightly exceeding average analyst forecasts of 515.5 million euros.
The company's passenger division transported 29.3 percent more people during the first six months of this year, 
boosting the top line.
Nonetheless, Lufthansa cut guidance for the division, saying the passenger transportation segment may fall short of 
last year's operating profit level as surging fuel prices squeeze margins.
ROUNDUP Lufthansa Q2 figs in line; analysts see FY guidance wobble
'But Lufthansa has so far dealt with the current environment very well and stuck with its optimistic (group) outlook 
for the year 2008,' said LBBW analyst Thomas Klee, adding the company is so faring better than many of its peers.
Ryanair earlier this week said it is not likely to post a profit this year unless there is a 'precipitous' fall in oil prices in 
the fourth quarter.
And in the United States, United Airlines, US Airways and JetBlue all recently reported losses as fuel costs hurt 
their bottom line.
UniCredit analyst Uwe Weinreich said he still expects Lufthansa to reach its full-year targets 'despite more 
challenging market conditions'.

British Airways and Iberia said yesterday they were confident of securing regulatory approval for their proposed 
merger.
In recent years Air France and Lufthansa faced few obstacles to their respective takeovers of KLM, the Dutch flag 
carrier, and Swiss International Air Lines.
European competition authorities have been broadly in favour of consolidation in the previously fragmented aviation 
sector, in particular where deals have had few network overlaps.
A notable exception was Ryanair's hostile attempted takeover in 2007 of AerLingus, which was blocked last year 
after a detailed Brussels investigation. The European Commission said a combination would lead to a near-
monopoly in the Irish market and harm passengers, a view Ryanair is still contesting fiercely in European courts.
International traffic rights remain a minefield. Concerns about rights torpedoed BA's talks about a takeover of KLM 
in 2000, but Air France and Lufthansa have since shown that the problem can be overcome.
The scale of the challenge has been reduced by the "open skies" treaty between the US and the European Union. 
All national carriers in the EU are now under a common European designation. Iberia therefore would face no 
danger of losing its traffic rights to the US if it were deemed UK-owned.
Other Iberia bilateral traffic rights outside the EU and the US will have to be renegotiated by the Spanish 
government.
BA and Iberia already operate a profit and revenue-sharing joint venture on their UK/Spain trunk routes between 
London and Madrid and Barcelona. That will be important for future scrutiny by the competition regulators.
The joint venture was given antitrust immunity by the European competition authorities in December 2003 and 
began operating in January 2005.

Dark skies still loom for the airlines

Yesterday's announcement from British Airways (BA) that it was set to merge with Spanish carrier Iberia provided a 
predictable boost to the company and its prospects.
As well as the immediate share price reaction, the duo argued that shareholders would benefit going forward as the 
two businesses were ideally suited, with little crossover between them.
In truth the deal could not have come at a better time for BA, with soaring oil costs impacting the business and a 
consumer slowdown likely to reduce the number of passengers.
BA's chief executive, Willie Walsh, admitted as much when he said: 'The aviation landscape is changing and airline 
consolidation is long overdue.'
AdmittedlyBAwould be less affected by a reduction in cheap weekend breaks than its rivals, given its focus on 
premium services.
However, investors noted that even Walsh's firm was stuck in a challenging environment at present.
UK fund manager Neil Cumming, who runs the £6.7 millionPSigma UK Growth fund, has been avoiding both BA 
and its low cost rival easyJet within his portfolio.
He noted that while both companies faced different challenges, they would be jointly impacted by high oil costs as 
well as a poorer consumer who is looking to cut back on discretionary spending.
Speaking before yesterday's merger announcement, he said: 'While BA has made a point of moving to offer 
premium class services, it will be a challenge for them to keep load factors up.'
Investors need not look far to find examples of other high-end airlines that have struggled, and indeed subsequently 
collapsed. In May Silverjet, the luxury carrier, grounded its fleet after the business-class only transatlantic carrier 
went into administration.
Prior to Silverjet's collapse, other business airlines including Maxjet and Eos went under as oil costs soared.
There are also other negatives to consider. Cumming added that BA had an older fleet than the other carriers and 
may need to replace it. Given the environment for borrowers at present, even if the company opted to do so using a 
loan arrangement any deal would likely cost more because of the credit crisis.
Dark skies still loom for the airlines
He concluded: 'We think it's too tough an environment for the airlines at present, as it's horribly difficult.'
Peter Shaw, investment manager at Aegon Asset Management, added that his company's view on airlines in the 
UK was currently negative, and it holds neither BA nor easyJet.
Regarding BA, Shaw said: 'It has a different mix of passengers (compared to easyJet) and the area that's held up 
well for it is long-haul business class, but we think in the current economic environment that will get affected.'
As to the smaller carriers, namely easyJet as well as Dublin-listed Ryanair, both managers warned they faced 
significant difficulties this year.
Cumming said: 'For easyJet and Ryanair growth has been based on people going on cheap holidays, and in tough 
times people will cut back.
'We've already seen Ryanair mothballing a lot of their fleet in the winter, and all of that is a sign that the airlines are 
being squeezed on all sides.'
Shaw added: 'Ryanair's results showed demand was getting hit, while it sounded as if bookings for 
September/October were lower than expected.
'We read that through to easyJet, and with consumer confidence also falling that will hit demand, so we expect 
yields to come down.'
It is of course important not to leave out the overriding influence on airlines, and the factor that not only makes 
further consolidation likely but also makes airlines' shares some of the most volatile on the market, namely the price 
of fuel.
Oil has more than doubled in price during the last year, climbing to over $140 a barrel recently, and as the price 
rose so the share price of the airlines descended.
For example BA has moved from a peak of 448p a share in October, when oil was between $80-90 a barrel, to 
almost half that price when it closed at 248.5p on Tuesday with oil at $125.
Meanwhile, easyJet has fallen from 648.5p, to sit at 318p, and Ryanair has followed suit.
Shaw conceded that the oil price was the main risk to his company's stance on the airlines, with a sharp correction 
likely to boost shares, but he said the environment for the companies remained tricky regardless.
He said: 'The key risk to our view is the oil price, as the shares move quite violently on that, but in summary the 
revenue environment will be challenged for airlines.'

Ryanair has reacted to yesterday's stock market mauling by slashing fares across Europe with 1million E1/£1 fares 
for travel in September as part of its plan to boost passenger numbers through the winter period.
Following yesterday's profit warning, the company said the announcement is a direct challenge to high cost airlines 
who continue to increase their fares and fuel surcharges.
Ryanair head of communications, Stephen McNamara said: 'Today's seat sale is the first in a series of fare 
promotions we plan for the winter schedule to ensure that passengers get the guaranteed lowest airfares only from 
Ryanair. Ryanair will keep Europe flying this winter by offering the lowest fares and we guarantee no fuel surcharge 
as well.'

Ryanair has reacted to yesterday's stock market mauling by slashing fares across Europe with 1million E1/£1 fares 
for travel in September as part of its plan to boost passenger numbers through the winter period.
Following yesterday's profit warning, the company said the announcement is a direct challenge to high cost airlines 
who continue to increase their fares and fuel surcharges.
Ryanair head of communications, Stephen McNamara said: 'Today's seat sale is the first in a series of fare 
promotions we plan for the winter schedule to ensure that passengers get the guaranteed lowest airfares only from 
Ryanair. Ryanair will keep Europe flying this winter by offering the lowest fares and we guarantee no fuel surcharge 
as well.'

From Mr Nigel Morton.
Sir, The true pioneer of the budget airline model was not Michael O'Leary, as you suggest ("Ryanair chief seeks 
new ploys in effort to fly clear of trouble", July 29). This accolade must be accorded to Herb Keller, founder of South 
West, the Dallas-based airline. Indeed, when trying to turn around the then ailing fortunes of Ryanair, Mr O'Leary 
described viewing the South West business model as his "road to Damascus" moment.

Ryanair to slash ticket prices by 10pc? Ryanair u-turn
Ryanair to slash ticket prices by 10pc?; Ryanair u-turn

Highlight: Ryanair could cut ticket prices by more than 10pc this winter to keep passenger numbers up
Body
Ryanair could cut ticket prices by more than 10pc this winter in a desperate bid to keep passenger numbers up, 
despite the deepening recession.
It marks a dramatic reversal of strategy at the airline, which just two months ago said it would raise fares by 5pc this 
year to compensate for record oil prices.
Ryanair now plans to absorb the massive oil rises itself and continue to push fares down. The strategy could mean 
the airline loses as much as E60m next year.
The stock market reacted with fury to the apparent u-turn, and repaid Ryanair by wiping E1.2bn from the airline's 
share price in just 10 minutes yesterday. The airline's latest gamble comes after its punt on fuel spectacularly 
backfired. The company failed to secure contracts to buy fuel at the dollar 100-mark last year, believing prices 
would fall. Oil has since topped the dollar 145 mark, leaving Ryanair massively exposed. It was estimated last night 
that this cost the company potentially hundreds of millions. In the three months to June 30 alone, Ryanair's fuel 
rocketed 93pc to E367m. The airline has now put in place contracts to buy 90pc of its September fuel at E129, and 
80pc of fuel for October to November at E124. Chief executive Michael O'Leary, who saw E54m of his personal 
wealth evaporate in the stock-market mauling, last night admitted he got it wrong. "There's no doubt I was overly 
optimistic two months ago, and, I can promise, you won't see that again while I live and breathe," he said. (Irish

(ANSA) - Ancona, July 29 - Irish low-cost air carrier Ryanair will launch on October 27, 2008 a flight connecting 
Ancona-Falconara airport, in the central Italian region of the Marches, with Dusseldorf, western Germany.
The new flight will be operated twice a week, on Mondays and Fridays. The flight will depart from Ancona, in 
Marches, at 1810 local time and will land in Dusseldorf at 2010 local time. The return flight will depart from 
Dusseldorf, at 1545 local time and will arrive in Ancona at 1745 local time.
The ticket price will be on special offer of 17 euro ($27), taxes included.
The company expects to transport 30,000 passengers on the Ancona- Dusseldorf destination in the first year of the 
flight. The flight is directed mainly to tourists during the first year, while in future it is expected to be also used for 
business trips.
The flight was presented in advance by Ryanair deputy marketing director for Italy, Giovanna Gentile, in Falconara, 
in the Marches, on July 29, 2008.
Besides the newly launched flight to Dusseldorf, the Irish air carrier launched a flight between Ancona and London 
in 2007, which registered 113,000 passengers.
Ryanair is used by some 60 million passengers per year. The company offers 729 destinations to 26 countries.

News Analysis
Despite cost-cutting measures, the airline must rely on rivals' demise, writes Kevin Done
Body
Michael O'Leary is finding it harder to pull new rabbits out of the hat to keep Ryanair in profit, as the global airline 
industry crisis deepens.
The iconoclastic boss of Ryanair faces his first annual loss since taking over as chief executive in January 1994, 
under pressure from record fuel costs and with consumer confidence plunging in key markets led by the UK and 
Ireland.
To date Mr O'Leary has been phenomenally successful. At turns bullying, foul-mouthed, charming and humorous, 
he has transformed the airline industry in Europe, forcing many of his much bigger network rivals to adopt lessons 
from the low-cost business manual.
Along the way he shrugged off the last aviation recession in the early years of the decade, exploiting the woes of 
rival carriers to expand faster.
Now though, he faces what looks like his biggest challenge, with people questioning his failed gamble on the oil 
price weakening and his ability to withstand a severe consumer slowdown. There are growing doubts about the 
budget airline model he pioneered.
Mr O'Leary, true to form, is still coming up with new cost-cutting ploys. In October he will begin to experiment with 
"zero baggage flights". On a trial basis Europe's biggest low-cost carrier will ban check-in bags on a few flights to 
test passenger responses.
It hopes the experiment will help lead to a sharp cut in airport passenger and baggage-handling costs and reduce 
the time needed to turn an aircraft round, as one response to offsetting the hugely damaging surge in fuel costs.
Ryanair chief seeks new ploys in effort to fly clear of trouble
The ban will be accompanied by the introduction in October of self-service check-in kiosks at its main bases at 
London Stansted and Dublin to reduce airport staff and handling costs further.
Mr O'Leary is also close to launching the long-awaited trial of a service allowing the inflight use of mobile phones 
and BlackBerrys, allowing Ryanair to earn a small commission.
Such innovations, though, pale into insignificance when set against the scale of the challenge posed by the surge in 
oil prices.
The airline's fuel bill increased 93 per cent year-on-year to EUR367m (£290m) as the crude oil price almost doubled 
from $61 to $117 a barrel. Fuel accounted for almost 50 per cent of Ryanair's total operating costs in its first quarter 
from April to June, up from 36 per cent a year earlier and from less than 17 per cent at the beginning of the decade.
Mr O'Leary gambled on the oil price weakening and chose not to hedge in recent months. He lost the bet in 
spectacular fashion and remains more exposed to current fuel prices than most rivals.
Given the magnitude of the task he faces to offset the impact of both soaring fuel costs and plunging consumer 
confidence, Mr O'Leary is resorting chiefly to familiar methods. Yesterday, as so often in the past, he grabbed for 
the ticket price lever to stimulate weakening passenger traffic, believing it to be his strongest weapon against the 
downturn.
Yet again he is launching a price war, gambling that consumers will trade down and that rivals will be forced to cut 
capacity and consolidate or else be forced out of business, ceding market share to Ryanair.
Only eight weeks ago, a more confident Mr O'Leary was forecasting a rise of 5 per cent in fares in the financial year 
to March 2009. Since then economies, in particular in the key Ryanair markets of the UK, Ireland and Spain, have 
weakened perceptibly.
Yesterday he forecast a fall in average fares of 5 per cent for the full year - they fell 8 per cent year-on-year in the 
first quarter from April to June. Such a fall, combined with $130-a-barrel oil, would plunge Ryanair from an 
underlying profit of EUR481m last year to a loss of up to EUR60m this year and at best break-even.
Mr O'Leary adamantly rejected suggestions yesterday that the low-cost airline business model was terminally 
broken.
As consumers became more price sensitive they would switch away from "high fare-fuel surcharging airlines" such 
as British Airways. "Higher oil prices will speed up the decline of high fare short-haul travel this winter as many 
European airlines consolidate or go bust," he said.
"We will respond as always with lower fares and aggressive pricing to keep people flying and maintain our high load 
factors . . . Ryanair will lead this downward pricing at a time when most of our competitors are hoping to raise fares 
and fuel surcharges."
To a large degree, Mr O'Leary is locked into this strategy. He has a stream of new jets being delivered from Boeing 
- the fleet will expand by 32 this year - which must all be filled.
Mr O'Leary is condemned to try to grow his way out of trouble, at a time when growth is incredibly difficult to come 
by.
"The market this winter will be heavily impacted by the timing and scale of European airline bankruptcies and 
consolidations, which are inevitable at these higher oil prices," was his typically defiant conclusion yesterday.
He is supported by one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. But he is relying on others going to the wall 
to ensure his own survival.
BA takes OpenSkies to Amsterdam
Ryanair chief seeks new ploys in effort to fly clear of trouble
British Airways is expanding its fledgling services between continental Europe and the US with the launch of a 
second route between Amsterdam and New York JFK airports in addition to the initial flights started in June 
between Paris Orly and New York.
The Amsterdam service, to open on October 15, will be operated by BA's new subsidiary airline OpenSkies, which it 
has established to take advantage of the "open skies" treaty agreed between the US and the European Union.
The treaty has made it possible for the first time for any European Union carrier to fly from any point in Europe to 
any point in the US - with reciprocal rights for US airlines.
OpenSkies marks the first time that BA has operated direct long-haul flights between continental Europe and the 
US.
The moves have already taken it into direct competition with Air France-KLM on its home turf in Paris and 
Amsterdam.

Ryanair fell heavily into loss in its first quarter and yesterday warned it could suffer an underlying loss of up to 
EUR60m (m$94) for the full year under pressure from surging fuel costs and falling airfares.
In afternoon trading Ryanair shares were down 22 per cent, triggering further falls across the aviation sector, as the 
company warned it could be in loss this year for the first time since it was floated in 1997.
For the three months from April to June, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier reported an 85 per cent fall in underlying 
net profits from EUR139m to EUR21m.
The Irish airline has suffered badly by losing its gamble that the oil price would fall back. Without the protection of 
hedging its fuel requirements it has carried the full burden of the rapid increase in fuel costs.
It said yesterday the policy had been reversed and it had begun to hedge again for the early winter.
Despite making a small operating profit in the quarter, it was pushed heavily into loss by exceptional items including 
a second heavy writedown of EUR93.6m on the value of its 29.8 per cent holding in Aer Lingus, the rival Irish 
carrier, and by accelerated depreciation of EUR17.9m on 15 older aircraft it plans to sell in 2009-10.
Including the one-off charges of EUR111.4m it fell to a pre-tax loss of EUR90.5m from a profit of EUR156m in the 
same period a year ago, its worst results for more than a decade. Ryanair's operating profits from continuing 
operations fell from EUR157.5m a year ago to EUR25.7m, before exceptional items of EUR17.9m, and to EUR7.9m 
including the charges.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said trading conditions had been "difficult" under the impact of higher fuel 
prices and timing of the Easter holidays, which were in March rather than in April.
The airline's fuel bill had increased by 93 per cent year-on-year to EUR367m as the crude oil price almost doubled 
from $61 to $117 a barrel. Fuel accounted for almost 50 per cent of its total operating costs, up from 36 per cent a 
year earlier.
Ryanair faces underlying loss of EUR60m as fuel prices rise
Ryanair said its average fare level had also fallen by 8 per cent, as it was forced to lower prices to fill seats in its 
growing fleet, as it opened new routes and bases. It was also hit by a reduction in the share of passengers paying 
to check in baggage.
Ryanair said it had taken advantage of the recent weakness in oil prices and was now 90 per cent hedged for 
September at $129 per barrel and was 80 per cent hedged for its third quarter at $124 per barrel. It was still 
unhedged for the fourth quarter from January to March 2009.
Mr O'Leary said: "The emerging economic recession in the UK and Ireland caused by the global credit crisis and 
high oil prices means that consumer confidence is plummeting, and we believe this will have an adverse impact on 
fares for the rest of the year."

Shares in airline tumble 23 per cent
Body
Ryanair shares tumbled 23 per cent yesterday after surging fuel costs and falling fares forced the airline to report a 
heavy first-quarter loss and warn it could fall into the red for the full year for the first time since it floated 11 years 
ago.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low- cost carrier, reported an 85 per cent fall in underlying net profits for its first quarter 
from April to June from EUR139m (£110m) to EUR21m, and said it could fall to a loss of up to EUR60m in the full 
year to March 2009.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, forecast a fall in fares and a burgeoning price war.
"The emerging economic recession in the UK and Ireland caused by the global credit crisis and high oil prices 
means that consumer confidence is plummeting, and we believe this will have an adverse impact on fares for the 
rest of the year."
Ryanair's share price plunged by 71 cents to EUR2.50, triggering falls across the sector with EasyJet falling by 8 
per cent and British Airways by 5 per cent.
In spite of making a small operating profit in the quarter, Ryanair was pushed heavily into loss by exceptional items, 
including a second heavy writedown of EUR93.6m on the value of its controversial 29.8 per cent holding in Aer 
Lingus, the rival Irish carrier, after its failed takeover bid.
Including total one-off charges of EUR111.4m, it fell to a first-quarter pre-tax loss of EUR90.5m from a profit of 
EUR156m in the same period a year ago, its worst results for more than a decade.
The Irish airline has suffered badly by losing its gamble that the oil price would fall back. By not hedging its fuel 
requirements, it has carried the full burden of the rapid rise in fuel costs. It has been forced to reverse this strategy 
and has resumed hedging in the past couple of weeks.
Surging fuel costs hit Ryanair
It said it had taken advantage of the recent weakness in oil prices and was now 90 per cent hedged for September 
at $129 per barrel and was 80 per cent hedged for its third quarter from October to December at $124 per barrel. It 
was still unhedged for the fourth quarter from January to March 2009 but was expecting to take out further hedges 
soon.
Its fuel bill increased by 93 per cent year-on-year to EUR367m in the quarter, as the crude oil price almost doubled 
from $61 (£30) to $117 a barrel.

Ryanair shares tumbled 23 per cent yesterday after surging fuel costs and falling airfares forced the airline to report 
a heavy first-quarter loss and warn it could fall into the red for the full year for the first time since it was floated 11 
years ago.
Europe's biggest low-cost carrier posted an 85 per cent fall in underlying net profits for its first quarter from April to 
June from EUR139m (£110m) to EUR21m, and said it may fall to a loss of up to EUR60m in the full year to March 
2009.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, forecast a fall in fares and a price war. "The emerging economic 
recession in the UK and Ireland caused by the global credit crisis and high oil prices means that consumer 
confidence is plummeting, and we believe this will have an adverse impact on fares for the rest of the year."
Ryanair's share price plunged by 71 cents to EUR2.50, triggering further falls across the aviation sector. EasyJet 
lost 8 per cent and British Airways 5 per cent.
In spite of making a small operating profit in the quarter, Ryan-air was pushed into loss by exceptional items 
including a second heavy writedown of EUR93.6m on the value of its controversial 29.8 per cent holding in Aer 
Lingus, the rival Irish carrier, after its failed takeover bid.
Including total one-off charges of EUR111.4m, it fell to a first quarter pre-tax loss of EUR90.5m from a profit of 
EUR156m a year ago.
The Irish airline lost its gamble that the oil price would fall back. By not hedging its fuel requirements it has carried

The airline's fuel bill increased by 93 per cent year-on-year to EUR367m in the quarter, as the crude oil price almost

Body
European financial stocks sank yesterday as traders grew increasingly twitchy ahead of earnings reports.
The trigger was a warning from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group that full-year profit would fall by the most 
since 1992 as bad debts mounted.
That knocked confidence in Europe's financial sector, which had rallied more than 16 per cent in 10 days.
A downgrade of the financial sector by Citigroup on Friday was still causing some upset ahead of results from 
several European banks, including Deutsche Bank and Banco Santander .
D Bank was down 2 per cent to EUR58.36 and Santander was 1 per cent lower at EUR12.
Irish banks suffered particularly badly. Allied Irish Banks , whose first-half results are due tomorrow, slipped 9.8 
per cent to EUR7.40 while Anglo Irish Bank slid 12.7 per cent to EUR5.28 and Bank of Ireland lost 10.5 per cent 
to EUR5.01.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.9 per cent to 1,158.86 and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 1.2 per cent to 4,324.45. 
Frankfurt's Xetra Dax lost 1.3 per cent to 6,351.15, not helped by data showing German consumer confidence at a 
five-year low.
A big faller on the Eurofirst 300 was Dutch postal company TNT , which lost 7.5 per cent to EUR22.18. Second-
quarter operating profit fell because of weaker demand in Europe.
Airlines were in trouble after Irish carrier Ryanair  lost 22.1 per cent to EUR2.52 after reporting an 85 per cent fall in 
first-quarter net profit on surging fuel bills.
Air France-KLM retreated 2.2 per cent to EUR16 while Lufthansa fell 3 per cent to EUR14.99 as its workers 
started a strike.
Financial sector confidence hit
On the upside, rallying metals prices on commodity exchanges helped miners and smelters reclaim lost ground.
Norwegian aluminium producer Norsk Hydro rose 4.9 per cent to NKr64.40 while steelmaker ArcelorMittal rose 
2.4 per cent to EUR50.97.
Stainless steel maker Outokumpu rose 6 per cent to EUR16.34, making it the biggest blue chip gainer in Helsinki.

Michael O'Leary warned in June that Ryanair would break even this year only with the benefit of rising airfares, 
such is the crippling impact of high fuel prices. In spite of the mountain of evidence that the consumer is buckling, it 
needed Mr O'Leary to spell out yesterday that fares would not be rising after all for the penny to drop in the City that 
2008 could be a lossmaking year for the Irish airline. As a result, the share price suffered the stock market 
equivalent of rapid descent.
Mr O'Leary is not one to take a crisis lying down and he is taking the battle to the competition by undercutting 
aggressively. If this is to be a low-fares environment, bring it on, is his attitude.
It is a strategy that will make investors queasy. But Mr O'Leary has a strong balance sheet on his side. Moreover, 
he has emerged from economic downturns with increased market share before. It is hard to believe from 
yesterday's share price reaction, but Mr O'Leary is still the most likely candidate to be the last man flying when the 
crisis is over.

Shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC and rival airlines fell Monday after Europe's leading budget airline recorded its first 
quarterly net loss since becoming a publicly listed company in 1997.
And Chief Executive Michael O'Leary warned that Ryanair also could be headed for a full-year loss because of 
stubbornly high oil prices and tightening consumer spending.
"The emerging economic recession in the United Kingdom and Ireland caused by the global credit crisis and high oil 
prices means that consumer confidence is plummeting, and we believe this will have an adverse impact on fares for 
the rest of the year," O'Leary said. "We will respond as always with lower fares and aggressive pricing to keep 
people flying and maintain our high load factors."
Ryanair's unexpectedly poor results drove shares down in airlines across Europe, particularly rival British no-frills 
carrier easyJet, which fell 7 percent on the London Stock Exchange.
In the quarter ended June 30, Ryanair reported a net loss of 90.5 million euros ($142.5 million). The airline fell into 
the red because of exceptional charges for depreciating assets: 93.6 million euros ($147.3 million) for its stake in 
rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus, and 17.9 million euros ($28.2 million) on 15 aircraft being decommissioned in the 
coming year.
Corporate accounting rules required Ryanair to record a formal loss on its Aer Lingus investment even though it has 
stated no intention of selling its nearly 30 percent holding because Aer Lingus shares have fallen in value for three 
straight quarters. O'Leary said Ryanair remains committed to acquiring Aer Lingus even though European Union 
competition authorities, the Irish government and Aer Lingus employees oppose the effort.
Excluding exceptional charges, Ryanair managed an after-tax profit of 21 million euros ($33 million), 85 percent 
lower than its 138.9 million-euro profit in April-June 2007.
O'Leary noted that profit was undermined by the fact that Easter, a high-traffic holiday that normally boosts first-
quarter figures, fell in an earlier quarter this year.
Ryanair shares slump after profit drop
Sales rose 12 percent to 777 million euros ($1.22 billion), weaker than analysts' forecasts. Money collected per 
passenger including from Ryanair's charges for booking, check-in, luggage and in-flight food and entertainment fell 
8 percent.
Ryanair shares fell 22.6 percent to end at 2.50 euros ($3.93) on the Irish Stock Exchange, rebounding from an 
initial 25 percent plunge.
Analysts said Ryanair was particularly suffering because of its decisions not to buy fuel in advance as the cost of a 
barrel of oil broke through the $100 and subsequent barriers. O'Leary admits he was counting on oil prices to fall 
back below $100 sooner, compared to Monday's price of $124.
Andrew Fitchie, an analyst at investment bankers Collins Stewart PLC in London, wrote that Ryanair is "directly in 
the path of the current economic storm."
"Its demand is made up of leisure traffic, much of which is highly discretionary short-break holidays, the leisure 
segment most vulnerable to economic squeeze," he said in an investors' note. "Lack of fuel hedging has left it 
exposed, and with substantial committed capex (capital expenditure) over the next two years, its returns are 
collapsing."
O'Leary had repeatedly vowed not to buy any advance aviation-fuel contracts while prices remained above $100 a 
barrel. But Ryanair confirmed Monday it has reversed that position, securing supplies for September at prices 
equivalent to $129 a barrel and the October-December quarter at $124.
O'Leary said the airline's first-quarter fuel bill rose 93 percent to 367 million euros ($557 million) and represents 
nearly 50 percent of total operating expenses, up from 36 percent a year ago.
"We continue to believe that oil prices remain subject to irrational exuberance. ... We will continue to absorb higher 
oil costs, even if it means short-term losses," O'Leary said in a statement.
He said Ryanair was on course to record no net profit in fiscal 2009 and could lose as much as 60 million euros 
($95 million). He based that forecast on a scenario where oil prices remain near $130 through March 2009 and 
average Ryanair fares fall 5 percent over the traditionally lean winter months.
But he said Ryanair would keep expanding its route network and planned to carry 58 million passengers in fiscal 
2009, a 14 percent gain. Ryanair previously forecast 16 percent growth.

Leading shares were slightly higher at midmorning on Monday, with oil producers and mining companies gaining 
from higher energy and metals prices, outweighing negatives such as losses for British Airways after disappointing 
numbers from Irish-based Ryanair.
At 9:52 a.m., the FTSE 100 index was 4.4 points higher at 5,357.0, having been down as much as 34 points earlier. 
The FTSE 250 index was down 19.4 points at 8,848.3.
Oil prices picked up from a seven-week low today, with Brent for September delivery trading at $125.56 a barrel, up 
$1.04, amid tension in Nigeria.
Index heavyweight BP, which reports second-quarter results on Tuesday, was 4 pence higher at 521-1/2, further 
helped by the go-ahead to develop a major deepwater project offshore Angola.
The rise came despite continued uncertainty on its Russian joint venture.
Among the other oil companies, BG Group was 12 firmer at 1,120, after HBSC upgraded its rating to 'overweight' 
from 'neutral', while Royal Dutch Shell was up 19 at 1,844. Among the exploration companies, Tullow Oil was up 15 
at 742.
In the mining sector, amid higher prices for most metals, BHP Billiton rose 44 to 1,597, Xstrata took on 86 at 3,356, 
Rio Tinto was up 76 at 5,030, Anglo American was 53 higher at 2,726 and Lonmin ticked up 41 at 2,372.
Positive earnings news from Pearson helped it top the leaderboard, up 18-1/2 at 614. The company reported solid 
first-half results on Monday, boosted by strong profits across its education, FT group and Penguin units, leading to 
a confident outlook for 2008.
Elsewhere, Reckitt Benckiser rose 56 to 2,592 after the group posted an 18 percent rise in first-half pretax profit on 
higher revenues and said it was on track to achieve full-year net income growth target of 11 percent at constant 
exchange rates.
Looking at the downside, airlines were in the doldrums as Ryanair reported that it is highly unlikely to make any 
profit this year unless there is a 'precipitous' fall in oil prices in the fourth quarter of its financial year.
London shares turn higher midmorning; oils and miners gain
British Airways, which reports first-quarter results on Friday, was 11-1/2 weaker at 235-1/4 and mid cap stock 
easyJet was down 24-3/4 at 310-3/4.
Meanwhile, HBOS was down 12-3/4 at 297-1/2 as the weekend press speculated that results on Thursday will see 
the group make major writedowns, as well as lower operating profits as mortgage activity declines.
Its banking peers were also under pressure. Barclays was off 5 at 351-1/2, Royal Bank of Scotland was 4-3/4 
weaker at 210-1/4 and Lloyds TSB was 7-1/4 lower at 324.
Banks may be hurt further with data this week expected to provide yet more gloomy news on the UK economy, 
revealing a further deterioration in the housing market, alongside evidence of a sharp slowing in retail sales and 
consumer confidence.
The release of the monthly house prices survey from Hometrack Monday showed prices fell for the tenth month in a 
row in July.
Average prices were down by 1.2 percent, compared to a 1.0 percent fall in June, with most of the price fall 
concentrated in southern England.
Figures from the Bank of England on Tuesday are expected to reveal a further slowing in mortgage lending and 
approvals, while the closely-watched monthly Nationwide survey is set to show house prices dropping again in July.
Meantime, a broker downgrade left shares in Sage 5.1 lower at 195.9 after JP Morgan cut the group to 
'underweight' from 'neutral'.
Looking at the midcaps, Detica Group surged 58-3/4 to 431 after defence group BAE Systems said it has made a 
538-million-pound offer for the national security consultancy.
In earnings news, Keller Group rose 34 to 682 after it said first-half pretax profit from continuing operations grew 19 
percent to 54.2 million pounds, adding it has entered the second half with a strong order book and expects full-year 
results to be in line with last year's performance.
In broker generated news, Jardine Lloyd Thompson was up 4-1/2 at 406 after Cazenove upgraded the group to 
'outperform' from 'in-line'.
Among the losers, there was more pain for hygiene company Rentokil Initial, after last week's plummet following a 
profit warning. The shares fell another 3-1/2 to 67-1/4 after Merrill Lynch removed the company from its Focus-1 list.

UK blue chips wre lower mid-afternoon as the DJIA posted opening losses with banking stocks posting heavy 
losses again on both sides of the Atlantic.
At 12:14 p.m., the FTSE 100 index was off 4.5 points at 5,346.6.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 46.6 points lower at 11324.1 and the NASDAQ was 9.28 points lower at 
2301.25..
Back in the UK, HBOS posted one of the largest percentage falls on the FTSE, off 15 pence at 295-1/4 as Citigroup 
cut its view of the banking sector to 'underweight' from 'neutral' and after a profit warning from Australia's third 
largest banking group Australia and New Zealand bank.
Barclays slipped 7-1/4 pence to 349-1/4, Royal Bank of Scotland fell 5-1/2 pence to 209-1/2, and Lloyds TSB 
dropped 7 pence to 324-1/4.
Meanwhile, a broker downgrade left shares in Sage 6.7 pence weaker at 194.3, with JP Morgan cutting the group to 
'underweight' from 'neutral'.
Elsewhere, airlines were in the doldrums as Ryanair warned it could make a full year loss of up to 60 million euros if 
oil prices stayed high and fares fell.
British Airways, which reports first-quarter results on Friday, shed 8-3/4 pence to 237-1/2, while midcap easyJet fell 
25-1/2 pence to 310.
On the upside, mining issues occupied the top seven spots on the FTSE 100 leaderboard amid higher prices for 
most metals and after a bullish note from Cheuvreux.
The French broker upgraded Anglo American Plc., BHP Billiton Plc. and Xstrata PLc. to 'outperform' from 
'underperform'.
Their shares rose 100 pence to 2,773 pence, 58 pence to 1,611 pence and 77 pence to 3,347.
London shares lower mid-afternoon; Dow posts opening losses as banks lose ground
Sticking with commodities, good gains were seen among oil companies as oil prices picked up from a seven-week 
low today, with Brent North Sea crude for September delivery up $1.58 to $126.10 a barrel.
BP, which reports second-quarter results on Tuesday, added 2-3/4 pence to 520-1/4, also helped by the go-ahead 
to develop a major deepwater project offshore Angola.
The rise came despite continued uncertainty on its Russian joint venture.
Among other oil stocks, BG Group added 10 pence to 1,118, with HSBC upgrading its rating on the company to 
'overweight' from 'neutral', while Royal Dutch Shell took on 23 pence to 1,825.
Elsewhere, Pearson climbed 11 pence to 606-1/2 after solid first-half results, boosted by strong profits across its 
education, FT group and Penguin units, leading to a confident outlook for 2008.
In other earnings news, Reckitt Benckiser added 64 pence to 2,600 after posting an 18 percent rise in first-half 
pretax profit on higher revenues and saying it is on track to achieve full-year net income growth target of 11 percent 
at constant exchange rates.
On the second tier, Detica surged nearly 18 percent or 65-1/2 pence to 437-3/4, after defence group BAE Systems 
said it has made a 538-million-pound offer for the national security consultancy, leading Panmure Gordon to 
upgrade the stock to 'buy' from 'hold'.
Keller was up 67-1/2 pence at 715-1/2 after it said first-half pretax profit from continuing operations grew 19 percent 
to 54.2 million pounds, adding it has entered the second half with a strong order book and expects full-year results 
to be in line with last year's performance. Dresdner Kleinwort said the update shows the group put in an excellent 
performance everywhere except North America.
A Cazenove upgrade to 'outperform' from 'in-line' helped send Jardine Lloyd Thompson 2-1/4 pence higher to 403-
3/4.
Among the losers, there was more pain for hygiene company Rentokil Initial, after last week's profit warning. The 
shares fell another 6 pence to 64-1/2 after Merrill Lynch removed the company from its Focus-1 list and Exane BNP 
Paribas cuts its earnings forecasts for the group by 23-25 percent for 2008 and 2009. The broker cut its target price 
to 70 pence from 90 pence.

Europe's largest exchanges were weaker at midday as investors locked in profits ahead of the oncoming earnings 
deluge, with indications the DJIA is expected to open lower, adding to jitters after disappointing updates Ryanair 
and TNT.
At 11.47 a.m., the DJ STOXX 50 was down 25.36 points, or 0.89 percent, to 2831.71, while the DJ STOXX 600 was 
down 2.22 euros, or 0.79 percent, to 279.54.
Spread betting company IG Index said the Dow Jones Industrial Average looks set to fall back 44 points in opening 
deals as ongoing uncertainty about the banking sector continues to dominate trading.
In Europe, shares in budget airline Ryanair plunged 13.56 percent after the group warned it could make a full-year 
loss of up to 60 million euros if oil prices remained high and the value of fares fell.
The Irish group said adjusted profit after tax for the three months to end-June had come in at 21 million euros.
Ryanair said first-quarter revenues grew by 12 percent to 777 million euros. That was well below the 865.4 million 
average of five forecasts in a Reuters survey, and lower than the most cautious of the five analysts, who predicted 
836.4 million.
The Dublin-based carrier said consumer confidence was plummeting in an emerging recession in the UK and 
Ireland, which it planned to respond to by cutting fares more aggressively than competitors.
The shares were also under pressure after Citigroup cut its stance to 'hold' from 'buy' before the warning.
Peer Easyjet slumped 6.48 percent and larger airlines were also lower. BA fell 4.66 percent. Shares in Lufthansa 
fell only 2.52 percent, finding support from news Citigroup had upped its rating to 'buy' and said the German flag 
carrier is its top pick.
Holland's TNT NV dropped 9.22 percent after it said it expects full-year 2008 organic growth and operating margins 
to come in at the low end of its guided range as it reported worse-than-expected second quarter results.
Euroshares open lower profit taking as Dow closed off highs; Ryanair , TNT weigh
Banks were on the back foot again as Citigroup downgraded the banking sector to 'underweight' from 'neutral', 
saying there will be more pain in the global economy as unemployment rises, there are more corporate failures, 
with asset values at risk and bad debt rates set to pick up.
Credit Agricole fell 3.08 percent.
BBVA was 1.58 percent lower after the Spanish banking group reported 19 percent fall in net income, which some 
analysts said was below the market expectations
Unicredit fell back 2.89 percent. SG Securities cut the Italian bank to 'hold' from 'buy'. Cheuvreux downgraded 
Banco Popular to 'sell' from 'underperform'. Its shares fell 1.55 percent.
There was some unexpectedly good news in the consumer goods sector.
Reckitt Benckiser shares moved up 1.66 percent after the world's biggest household cleaning goods maker said 
second-quarter profits rose 11 percent and that it was on track to meet its full-year sales and profit targets.
Group adjusted net profit for April-June of 240 million pounds, in line with forecasts ranging from 229 million to 240 
million and averaging 235 million pounds.
Investors cheered news Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company Unilever Plc., up 1.02 percent, said it will sell its 
North American laundry business to Vestar Capital Partners for $1.075 billion in cash, saying the price-tag was in 
line with market expectations.
Shares in Oil groups Repsol, Total and ENI rose 0.84 percent, 0.73 percent and 0.36 percent respectively, tracking 
crude prices, which rose on Monday as rebels said they had sabotaged two pipelines in Nigeria, which is a major 
exporter of crude.
New York's main contract, light sweet crude for Sept. delivery, advanced by 92 cents to 124.18 dollars a barrel.

Europe's largest exchanges are expected to tick lower in opening deals as investors lock in profits ahead of the 
oncoming earnings deluge and as the DJIA closed well off intra-day lows on Friday.
In the U.S., the DJIA index closed 21.41 points higher to 11,370.69 after better-than-expected economic data.
The index had been more than 50 points higher when European bourses closed.
Separately, the S&P 500 index advanced 5.22
Over in Asia, the Nikkei 225 index ended the morning up 71.07 points at 13,405.83, while the Hang Seng index 
ended the morning session 57.31 points higher at 22,798.02.
Meanwhile, oil prices remained close to a seven-week low of about $123 a barrel on Monday, pausing from a 
decline that has knocked more than $23 off crude in two weeks, despite escalating tensions in Iran and Nigeria.
U.S. light crude for September delivery rose 9 cents to $123.35 a barrel by 2335 GMT. The contract fell $2.23 on 
Friday to settle at $123.26, after falling to as low as $122.50, the lowest since June 5.
In earnings news, Budget airline Ryanair warned it could make a full year loss of up to 60 million euros if oil prices 
stayed high and fares fell.
The Irish group said adjusted profit after tax for the three months to the end of June had come in at 21 million euros 
($33 million).
Ryanair said first-quarter revenues grew by 12 percent to 777 million euros. That was well below the 865.4 million 
average of five forecasts in a Reuters survey and lower than the most cautious of the five analysts, who predicted 
836.4 million.
The Dublin-based carrier said consumer confidence was plummeting in an emerging recession in the UK and 
Ireland, which it planned to respond to by cutting fares more aggressively than competitors.
And Holland's TNT NV said on Monday it expects full-year 2008 organic growth and operating margins to come in 
at the low end of its guided range as it reported worse-than-expected second quarter results.
Euroshares outlook - profit taking to offset gains in New York, Asia
Sales for the period were 2.809 billion euros, up from 2.689 billion euros last year and in line with estimates of 
2.787 billion to 2.81 billion.
Operating profit (EBIT) was 324 million euros, down from 330 million last year and missing analysts estimates of 
339 million to 352 million.
Net profit fell to 205 million euros from 244 million euros and below estimates of 224 million to 232 million.
TNT said the full-year 2008 is expected to develop within its outlook range, albeit at the low end.

UK small cap's cemented their bullish start to the week, closing higher, as the blue chips found themselves weighed 
down by banking woes, with XSN the smaller company's biggest boomer as shareholders approved of the 
company's reverse takeover of Marinetrack Ltd.
At the close the FTSE small cap index was up 20.6 points at 2,719.1, whilst the FTSE 100 index was down 40.0 
points at 5,312.6.
XSN shares finished 0.30 pence higher at 1.05 - a 40 percent rise.
Takeover talk lifted Wilmington shares 32 pence to 197. It said it has received a preliminary approach which may or 
may not lead to an offer being made for the company.
Elsewhere, SMC climbed 1.25 pence to 7 pence after the company said the degree of revenue visibility for the 
remainder of 2008 and for 2009 remains high and that the aggregated group revenue shows no evidence of a 
slowdown in demand.
A bullish outlook drove Intelligent Environment's shares 0.875 pence higher to 7-1/2 after it said it expects its first 
half gross profit and operating profit to increase 'materially' compared with the same period last year.
Numbers news lifted OneClickHR 0-1/4 of a penny to 3-3/4 and Pixel Interactive Media 1-1/4 to 17.
Deal news lifted iPoint Media 3/4 of a penny to 17, while Acambis closed 69-1/2 pence higher at 185-1/2 as 
investors continued to cheer Friday's news that the group has agreed to a takeover offer from Sanofi Pasteur -- the 
vaccines division of Sanofi-Aventis -- that values the British company at around 276 million pounds.
Among the fallers, Cains Beer Company's shares received a lashing, falling 3.625 pence to 2.75, as the company's 
widening first-half losses and warning on its full-year performance provided a sobering thought for investors.
Ryanair plunged 0.7125 pence to 2.515, after posting disappointing first-half numbers and a bleak outlook, which 
prompted Collins Stewart to keep its 'sell' rating and Cazenove to repeat its 'underperform' recommendation.
ITM Power dropped 6-1/4 to 53-1/4, as it posted a bigger full-year loss but said its outlook has 'never looked 
brighter', citing increasing momentum for hydrogen as one of the primary sources of renewable power.
UK small caps close higher; XSN shares surge on reverse takeover approval
Disappointing numbers news also hit SDI, down half a penny at 12, Integrated Asset Management, falling 3-1/2 to 
37-1/2, William Sinclair, falling 4 to 57-1/2, Advent Capital, 10 lower at 165 and MTI Wireless Edge, 0-3/4 of a 
penny lower at 17.
Also on the back foot, Cape Lambert dropped 6.75 pence to 30-1/2, as the market reacted negatively to news that 
its shareholders have approved the sale of its iron ore project located in the Pilbara region of Western Australia to 
China Metallurgical Group Corp. for $400A million.
Finally, the termination of offer talks did Aero Inventory no favours. The company's shares plummeted 76 pence to 
455 after it said no satisfactory proposal was likely to be forthcoming.

UK blue chips turned lower in midday deals, ahead of an expected weaker start to the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average, with banks weighing in London.
At 12:14 p.m., the FTSE 100 index was off 23.9 points at 5,328.7, while the FTSE 250 index down 90.0 points at 
8,777.7.
'The Dow is seen opening lower after news First National Bank of Nevada and First Heritage Bank were closed by 
the FDIC, which is also having an affect on the UK market,' said Mic Mills from tradindex.com.
Spread bettors Tradindex expect the Dow Jones Industrial Average to open about 44 points lower at 11,320.
Back with UK equity movements, banks came under pressure after the U.S. news, as Australia's third-biggest 
lender, Australia and New Zealand bank, issued a profit warning on Monday, and as Citigroup downgraded the 
banking sector to 'underweight' from 'neutral'.
HBOS was the biggest faller, off 20-1/4 pence at 290, ahead of its interim results later in the week.
'Profits are expected to be down 60 percent on last year,' said Mic Mills from tradindex.com.
Its banking peers were also under pressure. Barclays slipped 8-1/2 pence to 348, Royal Bank of Scotland fell 9-1/4 
pence to 205-3/4, and Lloyds TSB dropped 7-3/4 pence to 323-1/2.
Meanwhile, a broker downgrade left shares in Sage 6.7 pence weaker at 194.3, with JP Morgan cutting the group to 
'underweight' from 'neutral'.
Elsewhere, airlines were in the doldrums as Ryanair after the group warned it could make a full year loss of up to 60 
million euros if oil prices stayed high and fares fell.
British Airways, which reports first-quarter results on Friday, shed 11-3/4 pence to 235, while midcap easyJet fell 
21-3/4 pence to 314-1/4.
On the upside, mining issues occupied the top seven spots on the FTSE 100 leaderboard amid higher prices for 
most metals.
London shares lower midday; DJIA seen weaker; UK banks weigh
Antofagasta was the best off, up 25-1/2 pence at 529-1/2, followed by Kazakhmys, 54 pence firmer at 1,357, with 
BHP Billiton adding 57 pence to 1,610, Vedanta Resources, up 64 pence at 1,828, Anglo American taking on 97 
pence to 2,770, Eurasian Natural Resources, 31-1/2 pence firmer at 911-1/2, and
Xstrata, up 95 pence at 3,365.
Sticking with commodities, good gains were seen among oil companies as oil prices picked up from a seven-week 
low today, with Brent for September delivery trading at $125.56 a barrel, up $1.04, amid tension in Nigeria.
BP, which reports second-quarter results on Tuesday, added 1-1/4 pence to 518-1/2, also helped by the go-ahead 
to develop a major deepwater project offshore Angola.
The rise came despite continued uncertainty on its Russian joint venture.
Among other oil stocks, BG Group added 7 pence to 1,115, with HBSC upgraded its rating on the company to 
'overweight' from 'neutral', while Royal Dutch Shell took on 27 pence to 1,852-1/2.
Elsewhere, Pearson climbed 12-1/2 pence to 608 after solid first-half results, boosted by strong profits across its 
education, FT group and Penguin units, leading to a confident outlook for 2008.
In other earnings news, Reckitt Benckiseradded 47 pence to 2,583 after posting an 18 percent rise in first-half 
pretax profit on higher revenues and saying it is on track to achieve full-year net income growth target of 11 percent 
at constant exchange rates.
On the second tier, Detica surged nearly 18 percent or 66-3/4 pence to 439, after defence group BAE Systems said 
it has made a 538-million-pound offer for the national security consultancy, leading Panmure Gordon to upgrade the 
stock to 'buy' from 'hold' and lift its price target to 440 pence from 272 pence.
Also making good progress was Keller, up 53-1/2 pence at 701-1/2, after it said first-half pretax profit from 
continuing operations grew 19 percent to 54.2 million pounds, adding it has entered the second half with a strong 
order book and expects full-year results to be in line with last year's performance.
A Cazenove upgrade to 'outperform' from 'in-line' helped send Jardine Lloyd Thompson 7-1/4 pence higher to 408-
3/4.
Among the losers, there was more pain for hygiene company Rentokil Initial, after last week's profit warning. The 
shares fell another 6 pence to 64-1/2 after Merrill Lynch removed the company from its Focus-1 list.

Ryanair shares nosedived this morning after the low fares airline warned that it might post its first annual lost as a 
public company.
Its shares dived by nearly 20pc initally on the Dublin market before settling at 278c , down 45c or 14pc.
Announcing a sharp drop in Q1 earnings, the airline made clear that it is expecting things to get much worse.
It said that if oil prices stayed at around USD 130 a barrel and fares fall by their expected 5pc, "we expect to record 
a full year result of between breakeven and a loss of E60m." In a statement, the airline's chief executive Michael 
O'Leary said :"The outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, which is entirely dependent on fares and fuel prices, 
remains poor. "The emerging economic recession in the U.K. and Ireland caused by the global credit crisis and high 
oil prices means that consumer confidence is plummeting, and we believe this will have an adverse impact on fares 
for the rest of the year." In its announcement this morning, the airline said profits for its first quarter had fallen by 
85pc to E21m, due to a doubling of fuel costs and the absence of Easter during the quarter. It said it had taken 
advantage of a recent weakening in oil prices to hedge 90pc of its fuel needs for September at USD 129 a barrel, 
80pc for Q3 nat USD 124 a barrel, but remained unhedged for Q4. O'Leary pledged that Ryanair would continue to 
cut prices, with a 5pc full year drop likely. He said: "The market this winter will be heavily impacted by the timing 
and scale of EU airline bankruptcies and consolidations ", adding that this would create more opportunities for 
Ryanair to grow.

Highlight: Ryanair's Q1 profit-fall has been blamed on doubling fuel costs and the absence of Easter in this quarter
Body
Ryanair's Q1 profit-fall of E21m, down E118m has been blamed on doubling fuel costs and the absence of Easter in 
this quarter.
Despite the absence of Easter, traffic grew by 19pc to 15m, as average fares (incl. bag charges) fell by 8pc to E42, 
while total revenues grew 12pc to E777m. Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 6pc, including fuel they increased by 
18pc.
Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said: "The demise of low fare air travel is again being predicted by high fare airlines 
like BA and others who are still losing shorthaul traffic to Ryanair. Higher oil prices won't end low fare air travel, it 
just increases the attraction of Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares, as consumers become more price sensitive and 
switch away from high fare/fuel surcharging airlines like BA.
His statement to the Irish Stock Exchange said (in full): "Trading conditions have been difficult in Q1 as we suffered 
the loss of Easter and the impact of higher fuel prices. Oil prices almost doubled in Q1 from dollar 61 to dollar 117 
(per barrel) as our fuel bill rose 93pc to E367m. Fuel now represents almost 50pc of our total operating costs 
compared to 36pc last year. "Yields fell by 8pc, as we opened new routes and bases and suffered the absence of 
Easter in the quarter which distorts the prior year comparables. Yields were also impacted by a reduction in 
checked in baggage penetration rates as more passengers switch to web check-in and carry on baggage facilities. 
Traffic grew by 19pc to 15m, whilst load factors at 81pc were almost in line with Q1 last year despite the absence of 
Easter. Ancillary revenues grew by 25pc, again faster than the rate of traffic growth, and we expect this to continue 
for the remainder of the year. "We have taken advantage of the recent weakness in oil prices and are now hedged 
90pc for September at dollar 129 per barrel, 80pc for Q3 at dollar 124 per barrel, but are unhedged for Q4. We 
continue to believe that oil prices remain subject to irrational exuberance. While many of our high fare competitors 
continue to increase fuel surcharges, Ryanair remains committed to our guarantee of no fuel surcharges - ever. We 
will continue to absorb higher oil costs, even if it means short-term losses, while we continue to deliver Europe's 
O'Leary blames oil and Easter for falls Ryanair falls
guaranteed lowest fares to our 58 million passengers. "Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 6pc, better than we 
previously expected. Including fuel unit costs rose 18pc. We have responded to these much higher oil prices by 
aggressively tackling costs in all other areas. In the last quarter we have added cheaper, fuel efficient aircraft. We 
have implemented a company wide pay freeze and redundancies in our Dublin Call Centre. We have renegotiated 
many of our airport maintenance and handling contracts and we plan to introduce check-in kiosks in October at our 
main bases in Dublin and Stansted to further reduce airport staff and handling costs. The increased discretionary 
charges for baggage and airport check-in have encouraged more passengers to use web check-in and carry-on 
luggage and this is helping to significantly reduce our handling costs.   "We have recently announced capacity 
reductions for the coming winter at our two highest cost airports in Stansted (15 aircraft grounded) and Dublin (4 
aircraft) where regulatory failure has allowed these monopolies to further increase their already high airport 
charges. These high costs make it more profitable to ground some aircraft rather than fly them at Dublin and

Highlight: Ryanair's Q1 profit-fall has been blamed on doubling fuel costs and the absence of Easter in this quarter
Body
Ryanair's Q1 profit-fall of E21m, down E118m has been blamed on doubling fuel costs and the absence of Easter in 
this quarter.
Despite the absence of Easter, traffic grew by 19pc to 15m, as average fares (incl. bag charges) fell by 8pc to E42, 
while total revenues grew 12pc to E777m. Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 6pc, including fuel they increased by 
18pc.
Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said: "The demise of low fare air travel is again being predicted by high fare airlines 
like BA and others who are still losing shorthaul traffic to Ryanair. Higher oil prices won't end low fare air travel, it 
just increases the attraction of Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares, as consumers become more price sensitive and 
switch away from high fare/fuel surcharging airlines like BA.
His statement to the Irish Stock Exchange said (in full): "Trading conditions have been difficult in Q1 as we suffered 
the loss of Easter and the impact of higher fuel prices. Oil prices almost doubled in Q1 from dollar 61 to dollar 117 
(per barrel) as our fuel bill rose 93pc to E367m. Fuel now represents almost 50pc of our total operating costs 
compared to 36pc last year. "Yields fell by 8pc, as we opened new routes and bases and suffered the absence of 
Easter in the quarter which distorts the prior year comparables. Yields were also impacted by a reduction in 
checked in baggage penetration rates as more passengers switch to web check-in and carry on baggage facilities. 
Traffic grew by 19pc to 15m, whilst load factors at 81pc were almost in line with Q1 last year despite the absence of 
Easter. Ancillary revenues grew by 25pc, again faster than the rate of traffic growth, and we expect this to continue 
for the remainder of the year. "We have taken advantage of the recent weakness in oil prices and are now hedged 
90pc for September at dollar 129 per barrel, 80pc for Q3 at dollar 124 per barrel, but are unhedged for Q4. We 
continue to believe that oil prices remain subject to irrational exuberance. While many of our high fare competitors 
continue to increase fuel surcharges, Ryanair remains committed to our guarantee of no fuel surcharges - ever. We 
will continue to absorb higher oil costs, even if it means short-term losses, while we continue to deliver Europe's

guaranteed lowest fares to our 58 million passengers. "Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 6pc, better than we 
previously expected. Including fuel unit costs rose 18pc. We have responded to these much higher oil prices by 
aggressively tackling costs in all other areas. In the last quarter we have added cheaper, fuel efficient aircraft. We 
have implemented a company wide pay freeze and redundancies in our Dublin Call Centre. We have renegotiated 
many of our airport maintenance and handling contracts and we plan to introduce check-in kiosks in October at our 
main bases in Dublin and Stansted to further reduce airport staff and handling costs. The increased discretionary 
charges for baggage and airport check-in have encouraged more passengers to use web check-in and carry-on 
luggage and this is helping to significantly reduce our handling costs.   "We have recently announced capacity 
reductions for the coming winter at our two highest cost airports in Stansted (15 aircraft grounded) and Dublin (4 
aircraft) where regulatory failure has allowed these monopolies to further increase their already high airport 
charges. These high costs make it more profitable to ground some aircraft rather than fly them at Dublin and 
Stansted this winter. Despite these cutbacks, Ryanair's traffic will still grow by approx. 9pc this winter as we switch

Ryanair shares nosedived by 22pc on the Dublin market today after the low fares airline warned that it might post its 
first annual lost as a public company.
They shed a massive 73c to close at just 250 after the carrier announced a sharp drop in Q1 earnings, and made 
clear that it is expecting things to get much worse.
It said that if oil prices stayed at around USD 130 a barrel and fares fell by an expected 5pc, "we expect to record a 
full year result of between breakeven and a loss of E60m".
 The Ryanair fall pulled Aer Lingus 24c, or 15pc, lower in its wake , making it the second worst performer of the day. 
Other big shares did badly as well, though not quite as disastrously as the airlines. But with double digit drops 
afflicting the whole financial sector, and construction shares also dipping shraply, it was overall a dreadful day for 
the exchange. The ISEQ index closed 256.95 points lower, or 5pc, at 4,619.20. It was the third straight session of 
big losses in Dublin and left the ISEQ index 540 points lower than just last Wednesday. Analysts said Ryanair's first 
quarter figures, also out yesterday, were well below what the market had expected, and so they are taking the 
carrier's warning about actual losses seriously. Davy Stockbrokers has already pencilled in a loss of E30m for the 
current year at the airline. Analysts Stephen Furlong there added, however. that the carrier would bounce back in 
2009-10. "We believe that Ryanair has the strongest business model and balance sheet to withstand and benefit 
from this cyclical downturn," he said. Among the banks in Dublin , AIB was down 80c, or nearly 10pc, to 740 ahead 
of its interims on Wednesday, when it is expected to freeze its dividend. Bank of Ireland had dropped 59c to 501, 
also around 10pc, while Anglo Irish Bank was off by 76c, or 12.5pc, to at 570. Irish Life and Permanent fell by 47c 
to 460. Analysts said the falls were in line with drops seen on the London market this morning, where Royal Bank of 
Scotland, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds TSB and Standard Chartered were all down sharply. The blame was being put 
on credit ratings agency Standard and Poor's, which said it might cut some ratings on Fannie Mae and Freddie

Mac, following the takeover of two small banks by U.S. regulators. Adding to negative sentiment, Citigroup cut 
European banks to "underweight" from "neutral". Things weren't so good on the construction front either. A survey 
by property consultant Hometrack showed British house prices fell for a 10th straight month in July to stand 4.4 
percent lower on the year. And new data released by the UK Office for National Statistics showed that orders 
obtained by contractors for new work were down sharply. Irish companies with exposure to the UK construction 
market were hit, with insulation specialist Kingspan down 46c to 622 and Grafton Group down 27c to 323. CRH 
dropped 35c to 1645 after Goodbody Stockbrokers noted that US new house figures for June declined by 0.6pc. 
Analysts Robert Eason said: "In terms of the absolute amount of new homes on the market, this continued its 
downward trend in June to 426,000 from 450,000 in May. We estimate that approximately 30pc of CRH's sales in 
the US are to the residential market." Drink group C and C bucked the market trend with a rise of 20c to 285 on 
news that total cider sales in the UK have increased by 12.4pc between January and May of this year. Smurfit 
Kappa dropped by 8c to 320 on news that a Belgian company is planning a big new containerboard mill in eastern 
Europe. With the market for containerboard oversupplied, Smurfit Kappa has already announced the closure of one 
of its mills in Spain and industry analysts say further closures in the sector are needed. Goodbody analyst Robert 
Eason said this morning: "This is not the right signal that players should be sending to the market at a time when 
prices are under pressure due to high inventory levels and softening demand." Among other movers today was 
Paddy Power, which slipped 88c to 1807.

Ryanair shares nosedived by 22pc on the Dublin market today after the low fares airline warned that it might post its 
first annual lost as a public company.
They shed a massive 73c to close at just 250 after the carrier announced a sharp drop in Q1 earnings, and made 
clear that it is expecting things to get much worse.
It said that if oil prices stayed at around USD 130 a barrel and fares fell by an expected 5pc, "we expect to record a 
full year result of between breakeven and a loss of E60m".
The Ryanair fall pulled Aer Lingus 24c, or 15pc, lower in its wake , making it the second worst performer of the day. 
Other big shares did badly as well, though not quite as disastrously as the airlines. But with double digit drops 
afflicting the whole financial sector, and construction shares also dipping shraply, it was overall a dreadful day for 
the exchange. The ISEQ index closed 256.95 points lower, or 5pc, at 4,619.20. It was the third straight session of 
big losses in Dublin and left the ISEQ index 540 points lower than just last Wednesday. Analysts said Ryanair's first 
quarter figures, also out yesterday, were well below what the market had expected, and so they are taking the 
carrier's warning about actual losses seriously. Davy Stockbrokers has already pencilled in a loss of E30m for the 
current year at the airline. Analysts Stephen Furlong there added, however. that the carrier would bounce back in 
2009-10. "We believe that Ryanair has the strongest business model and balance sheet to withstand and benefit 
from this cyclical downturn," he said. Among the banks in Dublin , AIB was down 80c, or nearly 10pc, to 740 ahead 
of its interims on Wednesday, when it is expected to freeze its dividend. Bank of Ireland had dropped 59c to 501, 
also around 10pc, while Anglo Irish Bank was off by 76c, or 12.5pc, to at 570. Irish Life and Permanent fell by 47c 
to 460. Analysts said the falls were in line with drops seen on the London market this morning, where Royal Bank of 
Scotland, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds TSB and Standard Chartered were all down sharply. The blame was being put 
on credit ratings agency Standard and Poor's, which said it might cut some ratings on Fannie Mae and Freddie

Mac, following the takeover of two small banks by U.S. regulators. Adding to negative sentiment, Citigroup cut 
European banks to "underweight" from "neutral". Things weren't so good on the construction front either. A survey 
by property consultant Hometrack showed British house prices fell for a 10th straight month in July to stand 4.4 
percent lower on the year. And new data released by the UK Office for National Statistics showed that orders 
obtained by contractors for new work were down sharply. Irish companies with exposure to the UK construction 
market were hit, with insulation specialist Kingspan down 46c to 622 and Grafton Group down 27c to 323. CRH 
dropped 35c to 1645 after Goodbody Stockbrokers noted that US new house figures for June declined by 0.6pc. 
Analysts Robert Eason said: "In terms of the absolute amount of new homes on the market, this continued its 
downward trend in June to 426,000 from 450,000 in May. We estimate that approximately 30pc of CRH's sales in 
the US are to the residential market." Drink group C and C bucked the market trend with a rise of 20c to 285 on 
news that total cider sales in the UK have increased by 12.4pc between January and May of this year. Smurfit

Body
A loss by Ryanair of 30m euro this year has been predicted today by a major Dublin stockbroking house.
The figure is half way between the possible outcomes of break even and a loss of 60m euro predicted by the airline 
itself this morning.
Analyst Stephen Furlong at Davy Stockbrokers said in a research note that the Q1 figures released this morning by 
the airline were significantly worse than his firm had been expecting.
Profit for the quarter of E 21m was less than half of the E48m his firm had been predicting. Its revenues of E776m 
were also well below an expected E836m. But he also pointed out that the airline's figures included an accelerated 
depreciation of E17.9m and a E93.6m writedown of its stake in Aer Lingus. "Previous guidance was for break even 
in the current year," he said. But now, based on existing fuel hedges, oil prices at around USD 130 a barrrel and 
average fares falling 5pc, Davy was reducing its own FY profit estimate to minus E30m. He added, however. that 
the airline would bounce back in 2009-10. "We continue to believe that Ryanair has the strongest business model 
and balance sheet to withstand and benefit from this cyclical downturn," he said. Analyst Neil Glynn at NCB 
Stockbrokers said the market had been taken by surprise on Ryanair's forecast of a 5pc avarge drop in fares this 
year. "To be honest, it's quite a phenomenal turnaround," he said, considering that on June 3 the airline had 
predicted that average fares would rise by as much as 5 percent. At Goodbody Stockbrokers, analyst John Goode 
agreed that the airline's Q1 earning were well below estimates, and that previous estimates of a profit for the year 
now faced "significant downside risks".

William Sinclair Holdings Plc. slumped 8 percent in early trade, as it cautioned that it sees profits for the 15 months 
to end-September significantly lower than market forecasts.
Shares tumbled 5 pence to 56-1/2 pence, as the group said the lower forecasts are due to escalating costs and a 
weather-hit peat harvest.
In a trading statement, the horticulture and garden products group said it will raise prices to restore margins for the 
next financial year.
Meanwhile, Ryanair Holdings shed 0.7275 of a penny to 2-1/2 pence -- or more than 20 percent -- as it cautioned it 
is unlikely to make a full-year profit unless fuel prices fall steeply.
The group's deputy CEO added that Ryanir's winter capacity cutbacks will remain.

Ryanair <RYA.I&gt; posted a 85 percent fall in first-quarter net profit on Monday as its fuel bill almost doubled and 
warned it could make a full-year loss of up to 60 million euros if oil prices stayed high and fares fell.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier said adjusted profit after tax for the three months to the end of June had come in at 
21 million euros ($33 million). That compared with a net income forecast of 48.8 million euros by brokerage Davy.
Ryanair <RYA.L&gt; said it had made use of a recent fall in oil prices and hedged 90 percent of its fuel needs for 
September at $129 per barrel, 80 percent for the third quarter at $124 per barrel, but remained unhedged for the 
fourth quarter.
'On the basis of our existing fuel hedges, Q4 oil prices at approx. $130 per barrel, and average fares falling by 5 
percent for the full year, we expect to record a full year result of between breakeven and a loss of 60 million euros,' 
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement.

Ryanair <RYA.I&gt; is highly unlikely to make any profit this year unless there is a 'precipitous' fall in oil prices in the 
fourth quarter of its financial year, Deputy Chief Executive Michael Cawley said.
Ryanair said earlier on Monday it expected a full-year result of between break-even and a loss of 60 million euros 
on the basis of its current fuel hedges, fourth-quarter oil prices at about $130 per barrel and average fares falling by 
5 percent.
Cawley also told Reuters in an interview that winter capacity cuts at airports where costs are high would remain a 
'continuing feature' for Ryanair.

Italy's antitrust authority on Monday fined Ryanair 54,100 euros ($85,500) for what the authority found was 
misleading advertising.
The regulator said in a statement the Dublin-based budget airline failed to include an additional cost in an ad posted 
on its Web site in 2007, offering one-way tickets starting from 10 euros ($15), tax included.
The authority said Ryanair did not include the fee that has to be paid if the purchase is made by credit card.
"As a consequence, the real price paid by consumers can turn out to be quite different from the advertised one," the 
regulator said. The cost appears at a later stage of the purchase.
Ryanair could not immediately be reached for comment. The airline has sued and been sued by national and 
European competition and advertising standards authorities over its practices.

Major airlines in the UKwere falling early on following Ryanair's revelation thatprofits had dropped 85% in the wake 
of spiraling oil costs.
Europe's largest low fares airline said profits for the first quarter of 2008 had slumped to 21 million, down 118 
million, as the impact of fuel price rises and the loss of the Easter trading period took its toll.
Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, noted that oil had almost doubled in price from the first quarter of last 
year, climbing 93% from $61 a barrel to $117.
He said: 'Trading conditions have been difficult in Q1 as we suffered the loss of Easter and the impact of higher fuel 
prices. Fuel now represents almost 50% of our total operating costs compared to 36% last year.'
Despite hedging fuel costs where possible, the company also revised down its profit expectations and warned it 
could make a loss of 60 million.
O'Leary said: 'On the basis of our existing fuel hedges, quarter four oil pricesat approximately $130 per barrel, and 
average fares falling by 5% for the full year, we expect to record a full year result of between breakeven and a loss 
of 60 million.'
The announcement sent shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA)down as much as a quarter early on, before they 
recovered a little. By 08:45am, they were trading down 17% or 0.55 euros, at 2.68.
The news dragged down its peers in London, with British Airways PLC (BAY)topping the FTSE 100 fallers after 
giving up 5.4% or 13.25p, to stand at 233.5p.
easyJet PLC (EZJ)dropped 9.2% or 30.75p on the news, to 304.75p.
Oil and the loss of Easter tradingcompared to last year overshadowed an increase in traffic at Ryanair by 19% to 15 
million passengers, as well asan increase in total revenues which grew 12% to 777 million.
However, O'Leary conceded that yields had also fallen 8%, after thecompany opened new routes and bases, while 
it also felt the pinch from a reduction in checked-in baggage penetration rates as more passengers switched to web 
check-in and carry on baggage facilities.
Airlines down as Ryanair 's profits tank
He added that although the downturn would provide opportunities for strong, well financed airlines to grow, the 
outlook for the year remained poor.
He said: 'The emerging economic recession in the UK and Ireland caused by the global credit crisis and high oil 
prices means that consumer confidence is plummeting, and we believe this will have an adverse impact on fares for 
the rest of the year.'

HBOS PLC (HBOS)ledthe blue chips lower justafter midday with banks enduring a difficult session at the start of 
what is expected to be a tough reporting week for the institutions.
By 12:14pm the FTSE 100 was down 23.6 points at 5,329, with the UK's biggest mortgage lender topping the fallers 
after giving up 6.3% or 19.5p, to stand at 290.75p.
Other financials, including Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Lloyds TSB, were also in the doldrums, with 
RBSdown 4.2% or 9p, at 206p, and Lloyds weaker by 2.7% or 9p, at 322.25p.
As well as the banks, airlines featured heavily among the losers after a profit warning from Ryanair which noted the 
impact high oil costs were having on the business.
British Airwayswas weaker by 5% or 12.5p, at 234.25p, while in the FTSE 250 easyJet had shed 6.9% or 23.25p, to 
312.25p.
A round of upgrades for the mining sector fromvarious brokers pushed stocks including Antofagasta,Anglo 
American,XstrataandBHP Billiton, into higher territory, helpingtostem losses among UK large cap stocks.
Antofagasta led the risers, putting on 5.8% or 29p, to 533p, after it was raised to a buy from neutral at UBS.
Meanwhile Anglo put on 4.4% to £27.90, while Xstrata was up 3.4% at £33.80 and BHP climbed 4.1% to £16.17.
Household products group Reckitt Benckiser, which owns brands including Vanish and Dettol, also provided 
support after its shares rose 2.4% or 60p, to £25.96, after announcing an 18% rise in profits.
The FTSE 250 was lower by 76 points, at 8,791.7, withRentokil Initial among the losers after declining 8.5% 
following a weaker than expected performance.
However,Detica Group provided some cheer after BAE Systems said it hadreached an agreement with thespecialist 
technology consultant tobuy the firm.
As a result its shares soared 17.1% or 63.75p, to 436p.

Share prices continue to present a lacklustre picture, although firm oils and miners, upbeat trading statements and 
a clutch of takeover situations provide some support.

250 index performed in similar fashion at 8,850, down 17 points after dropping to 8,777 earlier.

further 13.25p to 476.75 following a UBS rating downgrade and ahead of Wednesday's interims.
Unloved retailers had Marks & Spencer 6.75p adrift at 253p as ING initiated coverage of the stock with a sell rating 
and 200p price target.
Best of the miners were Antofagasta at 526p, BHP Billiton £16.10 and Xstrata £33.76, up 23p to 107p, while

Sainsbury attracted renewed speculative interest at 326.5p, up 9.5p and the sale of its North American 
laundrybusiness continued to strengthen Unilever at £14.93, up 30p.

among secondary issues included Morgan Sindall at 605p, Bluebay Asset Management 273.25p, Aveva Group 
£15.94, Fenner 251.75p and Go-Ahead Group £17.38, up 6.75p to 49p.

Communications 29p, Detica Group 432.5p and Wilmington 190p, but the collapse of talks left Aero Inventory 
languishing at 445.25p, down 82.5p.

statements underpinned SMC Group at 7p, Low & Bonar 103p, Keller Group 703p, Pixel Interactive 17p and 
OneClickHR 3.75p, up 0.25p to 55p.

of 35p to 998.5p ahead of results among dull retailers.
A broker ratingdowngrade contributed to a 12.25p fall in Aviva to 477.75p and a negative note from Deutsche Bank

Detica gained 58.25p to 420.5p following the £531 million offer from BAE Systems and Acambis surged 71p to

Body
Ryanair posted a 85pc fall in first-quarter net profit on Monday as its fuel bill almost doubled and warned it could 
make a full-year loss of up to E60m if oil prices stayed high and fares fell.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier said adjusted profit after tax for the three months to the end of June had come in at 
E21million. That compared with a net income forecast of E48.8m by brokerage Davy.
Ryanair said it had made use of a recent fall in oil prices and hedged 90pc of its fuel needs for September at dollar 
129 per barrel, 80pc for the third quarter at dollar 124 per barrel, but remained unhedged for the fourth quarter.
'On the basis of our existing fuel hedges, Q4 oil prices at approx. dollar 130 per barrel, and average fares falling by 
5pc for the full year, we expect to record a full year result of between breakeven and a loss of E60m' Chief 
Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary had yet another high-profile bust-up last week as he took his war on costs to Poland, 
dramatically abandoning plans to establish new bases in the country following a row over charges.
Just a week after axing routes from Dublin and Stansted and severing connections with seven airports on the 
continent, O'Leary was at it again.
Increased air traffic control charges would make these routes non-viable, the airline said, adding that passengers 
who had hoped to use the new routes could look to their local aviation authorities if they wanted someone to blame. 
It's a neat distraction, but one unlikely to catch astute Ryanair shareholders (of which O'Leary is one of the biggest) 
off-guard.
O'Leary's crusade to take out costs would not be quite so urgent had he not made an enormous mistake in failing to 
hedge the airline's fuel costs and protect it from soaring oil prices when he had the chance.
Shutting routes and putting a lid on fresh expansion to teach airport authorities a thing or two is all very fine, but 
shareholders may justifiably ask whether the ''non-viable'' routes in question would have stood a fighting chance of 
breaking even if Ryanair had done its bit to keep fuel costs down.
We have come to expect O'Leary blaming everyone else for getting it wrong, but he too deserves a place on the 
podium when the medals for inadequate cost controls are being handed out.
Instead, Ryanair shareholders must learn to live with expensive planes standing idly over the winter months, as the 
airline would lose money if they did what they had been bought to do - carry passengers.
They may also wonder if O'Leary's aggressive expansion plans have turned out to be a little too ambitious, as an 
economic downturn depresses demand for new services and makes it harder to fill planes on existing routes.
Comment: O'Leary ought to follow his own low-cost advice
The trouble with never making mistakes is that one never gets to learn from them. O'Leary may emerge from the 
current challenging climate a little wiser, but it will have been an expensive lesson for shareholders. And a noisy 
one for airport bosses.

Banks 
HBOS's £4bn rights issue failed to inspire its shareholders this week as only 8.3 per cent of investors took up their 
allocations in the 275p issue - exceeding even the most pessimistic market expectations.
Morgan Stanley and Dresdner Kleinwort, who underwrote the issue, were able to lift the eventual take-up to 38 per 
cent but were still left with 62 per cent of unwanted shares - worth £2.5bn at the offer price. HBOS attributes the low 
take-up to unprecedented market conditions, highlighting the fact that it raised the £4bn it set out to in April.
Allstate, the US insurer, could be the only serious bidder for Royal Bank of Scotland's insurance assets, raising 
further doubts about whether the bank can offload its insurance businesses, which include Direct Line and 
Churchill. Allstate is still working on a bid, although its offer is likely to be below the £7bn price tag attached to RBS 
insurance when it was put up for sale in April, according to people familiar with the process.
Concern over RBS's ability to sell the assets was heightened after Zurich Financial Services, widely seen to be in a 
leading position to clinch the assets, pulled out two weeks ago.
Telecoms 
Vodafone spooked markets by downgrading its revenue expectation for 2008-09 to £39.8bn after admitting the 
economic downturn was hurting its mobile businesses in Spain and the UK. Shares fell almost 14 per cent on 
Tuesday, the biggest one-day fall in the company's history.
Arun Sarin, outgoing chief executive, said the company was "resilient" but not "immune" to the economic downturn 
and insisted that Vodafone "will ride this one through".
The Week
In the wake of Tuesday's drop Vodafone announced plans for a surprise £1bn share buy-back on Wednesday, 
saying: "This action reflects the board's belief that the share price significantly undervalues Vodafone". The move 
pushed the shares just 2.4 per cent higher on the day.
Travel & Leisure 
Share prices across the aviation sector fell sharply as EasyJet announced that profits could fall by more than 40 per 
cent this year because of the surge in fuel costs.
EasyJet said pre-tax profits, before one-off items, would fall to £110m-£120m in the current financial year from 
£191m a year ago. Shares in EasyJet fell 10 per cent on Thursday, British Airways shares fell 8 per cent, Ryanair 
fell 3 per cent and Air France- KLM was down 5.3 per cent.
EasyJet had expected fuel costs for the year to September 2008 to rise by £185m but said it had managed to offset 
half of the increase by cutting other costs and raising revenues per passenger. EasyJet also plans to cut sharply its 
rate of capital growth during the winter and to cut capacity at its London Stanstead base. It will also close its 
Dortmund base in Germany.
Pharmaceuticals 
GlaxoSmithKline revealed a strategic overhaul that includes a plan to sell a wide range of generic medicines under 
a pioneering deal to boost sales in emerging markets with Aspen of South Africa.
The move is one of a number of initiatives revealed by Andrew Witty, the new chief executive. The Aspen deal 
follows a recent trend of pharmaceuticals groups producing patented medicines seeking to diversify into the off-
patent generics sector.
The company will also open up its portfolio of experimental drugs to external scrutiny by venture capitalists and 
healthcare participants.
Oil & Gas 
Royal Dutch Shell could become the first oil major to have a woman chief executive - and the biggest company in 
any industry to be led by one - if it decides to appoint Linda Cook as its next chief executive. Jeroen van der Veer 
will step down next June after five years in charge and Ms Cook is seen by many as having the edge over Malcolm 
Brinded.
Utilities 
EDF , France's electricity monopoly, is close to agreeing a takeover of British Energy for more than £11bn in a deal 
that could be announced as early as next week. Both sides said that progress had been made in the lengthy 
negotiation process, but people close to the negotiations warned that an agreement was not certain.
British Energy, which owns most of the UK's nuclear power stations, put itself up for sale this year. EDF made an 
indicative offer of about 680p a share in May, which was rejected.
The company has indicated it was prepared to increase its bid to 700p a share but it is not clear whether the two 
had agreed on a price.

EasyJet profits could fall by more than 40 per cent this year because of the surge in fuel costs, the airline said 
yesterday, triggering a steep fall in share prices across the aviation sector.
EasyJet shares fell 37½p or 10 per cent to 332½p. British Airways fell 8 per cent, Ryanair by about 3 per cent and 
Air France-KLM by 5.3 per cent, largely wiping out the previous day's gains, which had come in response to this 
week's fall in the crude oil price.
In recent days, however, jet kerosene prices have fallen far less than the price of crude oil.
EasyJet forecast pre-tax profits, before one-off items, would fall to £110m-£120m in the current financial year to the 
end of September, from £191m a year ago, based on an average jet fuel price of $1,280 (£643) per tonne in the six 
months from April to September.
Jet fuel is trading at just under $1,300 a tonne. Easy Jet has hedged 28 per cent of its fuel requirements for the next 
financial year to September 2009 at $1,265 a tonne. It expected fuel costs for the year to September 2008 to rise by 
£185m but said it had managed to offset about half of the increase by cutting other costs and raising revenues per 
passenger.
EasyJet, the UK's leading budget airline, also plans to sharply cut its rate of capacity growth during the winter and 
to cut capacity at its London Stansted base. The company will also close its Dortmund base in Germany.
It said the winter season would be "challenging" for the entire airline sector.
The EasyJet statement followed recent announcements by Ryanair, its Irish rival, of capacity reductions during the 
winter at its main Stansted and Dublin bases. British Airways is expected to announce plans next week to cut 
capacity in the winter by 3-5 per cent, mainly in short-haul European flights.
EasyJet said that its underlying business continued to "perform well and in line with expectations". Non-fuel costs in 
the second half were also hit, however, by higher airport charges, in particular at London Gatwick, owned by BAA.
EasyJet profit fears over rise in fuel costs sparks sector slide
The airline is seeking a judicial review of the sharp rise in Gatwick charges, approved earlier this year by the Civil 
Aviation Authority, the economic regulator for the three main London airports. EasyJet is reducing its capacity 
growth this winter to between 4 and 6 per cent from a previous level of about 15 per cent. At Stansted, winter 
capacity will be cut by about 12 per cent as the airline reduces unprofitable flying.
It plans to re-allocate some capacity from poorer-performing bases, such as Dortmund, to stronger airports such as 
Milan Malpensa, Gatwick and Paris Charles de Gaulle. Ryanair said last week it was cutting the number of weekly 
flights to and from Stansted by 14 per cent this winter.
EasyJet said flexibility was vital in a volatile environment.

As airlines cut capacity or slow growth in the winter months consumers will find it harder to pick up bargain fares, in 
particular when booking late, writes Kevin Done .
Carriers are cutting activity on some loss-making routes as they try to reduce the impact of the surge in fuel costs.
Moves announced by Ryanair and EasyJet will probably be followed by similar action from British Airways and 
British Midland in the coming weeks.
Passengers will find a reduced number of daily services to some destinations, while some marginal routes could be 
eliminated altogether. In the UK, routes from London Stansted appear to be bearing the brunt of the winter cuts to 
date.
Both Ryanair and EasyJet still have a large number of new aircraft being delivered during the next year. When the 
market gets particularly tough deep in the winter, Ryanair is likely to stick to its formula of a fire sale of "distressed 
inventory" at very low prices in order to stimulate traffic.
However, remember to look at the final price . Bags, airport check-in and credit card fees are all charged as extras.

Budget airline easyJet PLC said it will cut flights over winter to trim costs as it revealed on Thursday it expects full-
year pretax profit to fall as much as 45 percent because of higher fuel expenses.
The carrier said the increase in oil prices over the past few months have added around 185 million pounds ($368.3 
million) to its fuel bill this year.
While easyJet has offset more than half that increase through increased revenue and cost cutting, it said the higher 
charges will result in a full-year pretax profit of between 110 million pounds ($218.9 million) and 120 million pounds 
($238.9 million) nearly half of what it reported last year.
In a bid to keep costs down, easyJet followed its fellow budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC in announcing a 
slimmer winter flying schedule, cutting capacity at London airport Stansted by 12 percent.
Other cost-cutting measures include reducing the number of flights during less profitable times and reallocating 
aircraft from less popular bases to busier areas. The carrier, which operates 356 routes from 20 bases, has already 
said that the future of its base in Dortmund, Germany, is under review.
"In the current environment, flexibility is vital and easyJet continues to review its schedule and may make further 
adjustments, both to eliminate unprofitable flying and to seize opportunities," the company said in a trading update.
Kerosene, the fuel distilled from crude oil used to power planes, now accounts for around 40 percent of airline 
costs, up from 13 percent five years ago, the International Air Transport Association said.
Those escalating energy costs have caused 25 carriers including business class airlines Eos, Maxjet and Silverjet 
to cease operations in the past six months and IATA forecasts industrywide losses of $2.3 billion this year.
Low-cost carriers have so far escaped the worst of the downturn and easyJet's third quarter update had some 
positive news, revealing that for the moment many people are still flying in the budget sector. Total revenue climbed 
32 percent, while passenger numbers rose 16 percent.

EasyJet said the majority of the growth was focused around London, France, Italy and Spain.
It added that a significant proportion of its passenger revenues are euro-denominated, allowing the company to 
benefit from the strengthening of the euro.
Budget airlines are increasingly ramping up measures to offset rising costs. Ryanair earlier this month said it would 
cut around 250 flights from Stansted this winter.

EasyJet is to cut flights this winter in order to protect its margins, it said this morning.
The cuts by the budget carrier will reduce capacity by 4-6pc and follow a similar move by its rival Ryanair.
EasyJet said this morning that its full year pretax profit would fall to a worse-than-expected £110-120m.
Analysts had been expecting a drop to around £138 m for the year to September, according to Reuters estimates, 
from a pretax profit of £191 m last year. The company said in a statement the high price of oil had added around 
£185 m to its fuel bill, which in turn had hit margins. EasyJet said it had already offset around 50 percent of its fuel 
bill increase through cost cuts. Third-quarter revenue was up 32 percent to 641 million pounds as it absorbed the 
acquisition of GB Airways, while revenue per seat was up 12 percent in the same period. 'EasyJet's Q3 trading 
update was broadly reassuring for the current year and showed strong growth in volumes and revenues ... We view 
the move to cut capacity growth this winter as sensible,' Credit Suisse analyst Gerald Khoo said in a note. The 
shares, down nearly 40 percent in the year to date, closed yesterday at 369.25 pence, valuing the airline at around 
£1.5 billion.

executives, according to Credit Suisse, reflecting a huge cultural shift

Bank reported dreadful results on Tuesday, their shares soared. The sector as a whole is up 6% this week
* European carmakers -- Wednesday was a lovely day for tootling around in European automobile stocks. Peugeot

Tales of woe as consumers tighten belts

Pints of beer, Marks and Spencer's ready meals and flights to continental Europe are among the things that 
consumers are cutting back on as they tighten household budgets.
Yesterday, the latest mobile phone joined a growing list of products that the British consumer is learning to live 
without. Vodafone, the world's largest mobile phone operator, said that the number of customers coming through its 
doors was slowing in the UK as shoppers choose to put up with old handsets rather than splashing out on new 
models.
The glum news prompted the biggest ever one-day slide in Vodafone's share price. But at least Vittorio Colao, 
incoming chief executive, is not suffering alone. A raft of consumer-facing companies have delivered woeful trading 
updates over the past couple of months as the credit crunch has spilled out of the City and into high streets.
The early part of the year was mixed, but May and June were by, most accounts, awful. July is not shaping upany 
better.
M&S set economic alarm bells ringing in early July, when the high street bellwether issued a shock profits warning 
and told investors Britain was facing its most severe consumer downturn since the 1990s. The shares fell by a 
quarter on the newsand dragged down the rest of the retail sector.
A dearth of customers with money to spend on new cars has also prompted profits warnings from the UK's biggest 
car lot retailers, Pendragon and Lookers, while electricals and homewares businesses are also struggling to hit big-
ticket sales.
And with consumer confidence figures from May indicating a low not seen since 1990, the contagion is spreading 
inexorably beyond the high street.
Others feeling the bite include Trinity Mirror, the newspaper group, which issued a profits warning on the back of 
falling advertising sales.
Tales of woe as consumers tighten belts
Taylor Wimpey, Britain's biggest housebuilder, ran into trouble this month after failing to secure new financing from 
shareholders in a £500m cash call.
In the airline sector, Ryanair plans to ground 20 jets, about a tenth of its fleet, over winter in response to tougher 
times and the soaring price of fuel. And British Airways is "up to its neck in perhaps the biggest crisis the aviation 
industry has ever known", according to Martin Broughton, chairman.
And it appears consumers are not even reacting to the pressures on their purses by drowning their sorrows, at least 
not in their local ale houses. Enterprise Inns, operator of more than 7,000 British pubs, said yesterday that beer 
sales were falling sharply.

Ryanair says wins battle to continue late night flights to Rome Ciampino airport
Ryanair says wins battle to continue late night flights to Rome Ciampino

No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings said it has won a court injunction against the Italian aviation regulator's decision to 
force it to divert late-night flights from Rome's Ciampino airport to the city's other airport, Fiumicino.
The Dublin-based carrier claimed regulator ENAC had 'unlawfully' prevented 18 late evening flights carrying more 
than 2,700 passengers from landing as scheduled in Rome Ciampino since January, instead diverting them to 
Rome Fiumicino Airport.
It said the diversions had resulted in late evening disruption and long and inconvenient bus journeys for thousands 
of Italians and tourists back to Ciampino to collect their cars or to meet relatives.
Ryanair claimed ENAC was flouting its own rules and regulations, which the airline claims allow Ciampino-based 
aircraft to land after the midnight curfew at Ciampino.
The Irish airline said it uses the quietest commercial aircraft in Europe for the flights. These aircraft do not create 
any significant noise because they are landing flights only and do not result in a subsequent take-off.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary accused ENAC of trying to disrupt its operations at Ciampino as part of 
attempts to help beleaguered Italian flag carrier Alitalia.
'We welcome the TAR Lazio Court's confirmation that Ryanair's aircraft can land at Ciampino Airport after the 
curfew and we now call upon ENAC to put an end to these unlawful and illegal diversions, which are causing 
serious disruptions and inconvenience to Ryanair's flights and Ryanair passengers,' O'Leary said in a statement.

UK small caps closed sharply lower, dragged down by weakness among blue chips, with Myhome International 
remaining hard-hit after it announced it has breached some of its banking facility covenants.
At the close, the FTSE Small Cap index was 15.3 points down to 2,716.0, while the FTSE 100 index fell 40.2 points 
to 5,364.1.
Myhome shed 3 pence to 4.875 pence on news it has breached some of its banking facility covenants due to a 
weak economic climate and reduced trading expectations.
However, it said it was in 'constructive' talks with Lloyds TSB to restructure its 8 million pound bank line.
A full-year profit warning knocked 4 off Network Data, to 10, and prompted Brewin Dolphin to cut the stock to a 
'hold' from 'buy'.
Interactive mobile entertainment and information services provider WIN declined 8 to 106 after it also issued a full-
year profits warning.
Customvis fell 0-3/4 of a penny to 2-1/4 after it said it sees revenue for the year to end-June lower than market 
expectations and a loss for the period in the region of 1 million pounds.
Canadian miner Kirkland Lake Gold ended the session 20 off to 415, with news of reduced gold production 
outweighing a narrowing of full-year losses.
Supporta fell 4 to 25 after Romac Investments terminated offer talks. Nestor Healthcare slid 3 to 45 after it emerged 
a sale of the whole company looked increasingly unlikely, leading Brewin Dolphin to cut the stock to 'hold' from 
'buy'.
Northacre stayed strong, up 8-1/2 to 41-1/2, after it successfully won planning permission for its proposed 
residential development of West London's telephone exchange site in Warwick Road.
Ryanair Holdings rose 0.095 a penny to 3.215 after it won its battle to continue late night flights to Rome Ciampino.
Paragon Group of Companies rose 26 to 110 -- or 30 percent -- after it confirmed a number of bid approaches, with 
brokers guessing offers will be in the region of 100 pence to 150 pence a share.
UK small caps close sharply lower; Myhome slumps on covenant woe
Among miners, Herencia Resources rose 0.2 of a penny to 1.05 -- or 23 percent -- after it said the latest drilling at 
the Patricia deposit, part of its 70 percent-owned Paguanta zinc-lead-silver project in northern Chile, has returned 
positive results with multiple high-grade intersections.
Across the sector, Lithic Metals & Energy edged up 0-1/4 of a penny to 5 after it successfully negotiated with BHP 
Billiton for 100 percent unencumbered ownership of the Mavita licences, Mozambique.
Entertainment Rights delivered for investors, rising 1.2 to 6.47 -- or 22 percent -- after it announced the launch of 
Postman Pat on China's state and largest broadcaster, China Central Television.
Collins Stewart retained a 'buy' stance on the stock.
Sinclair Pharma extended gains, closing up 4-1/2 to 37-1/4 on hopes that 2008 sales will be up 30 percent on last 
year, leading to its first profitable full year since its IPO.
Landsbanki kept its 'buy' stance, noting the shares are trading well below its 152 pence fair value on the business.
Summit Corp climbed 7 to 62-1/2 after it entered into a worldwide licensing agreement with BioMarin 
Pharmaceutical for the company's pre-clinical candidate SMT C1100 to treat the fatal genetic disorder Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy.
Landsbanki said its valuation of 135 pence a share represents around 127 percent potential upside to Summit's 
current share price and underpins its 'buy' recommendation for the stock.
Velosi rose 5-1/2 to 92-1/2 on the back of a positive update, while smartFOCUS Group increased 0-1/2 of a penny 
to 10 after the international marketing software group was selected to provide Chelsea Football Club with software 
and services.
Fortune Oil gained 0.85 of a penny to 9.4 following government approval for its Tianjin Tianhui Natural Gas joint 
venture to construct a high capacity gas pipeline from Xiao-Bian-Zhuang to the Jinghai Industrial Park in Tianjin.

No-frills airline, Ryanair, this morning began its new Dublin to Kerry route when a Boeing 737-800 series jet 
departed Kerry on-time at 6.25am and landed in Dublin 10 minutes ahead of schedule at 7.05am.
Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary joined the 60 other passengers on board the inaugural flight, and 
offered each of them a full cup of tea/coffee entirely free of charge.
Mr O'Leary claimed that since Kerry won't make the All Ireland Final this year, Ryanair will have to do everything it 
can to try to keep traffic and load factors up during the month of September.
 Mr O'Leary used the Kerry-Dublin inaugural flight to again call on Kerry Airport to lower its charges on the Kerry-
Dublin route. Ryanair has written twice to the Board of Kerry Airport offering to put in the same low fares on the 
Kerry-Dublin route as it presently offers on the Kerry-Frankfurt and London routes, if Kerry Airport will reciprocate by 
offering Ryanair the same low costs.

Ryanair has won an injunction against the Italian aviation regulator ENAC over landing rights at Rome's Ciampino

The court order overturns an ordinance by ENAC, which forced Ryanair's Ciampino-based aircraft to divert late at 
night to Rome Fiumicino, disrupting the travel plans of thousands of Italian citizens and visitors.
The budget airline said that, since January, a total of 18 flights and over 2,700 passengers had been diverted on 
late evening flights and prevented from landing as scheduled in Rome Ciampino, and instead diverted to Rome 
Fiumicino Airport. 
 This meant late evening disruptions and long and inconvenient bus journeys for Italian visitors and citizens back to

A better than expected report from the world's biggest bank, Citigroup, helped lift Irish financial in morning deals 
today and pushing the ISEQ back over the 5,000 level.
By 11:30, the ISEQ had gained 120.91 points to 5,015.38.
Banking stocks, the biggest fallers in last week's slump, were the biggest gainers from the rebound aver the past 
three sessions.
 European stock markets moved higher in response to Citigroup's results on Friday and hopes that the worst of the 
financial markets slump could well be over. The group reported a second-quarter loss of USD2.5 billion as it 
continued to count the cost of its sub-prime mortgage exposure. While the group wrote down its assets to the tune 
of USD7.2 billion, it still reported earnings per share for the quarter ahead of analyst expectations and the stock 
rallied nearly 8pc on the day. However, the gains were restricted on London's FTSE by HBOS' overhang of shares 
from its rights issue after the mortgage bank said shareholders subscribed to buy just 8.3pc of shares in its £4 
billion rights issue, leaving its underwriters to try to sell almost £3.8 billion of shares. HBOS, seeking to repair its 
balance sheet from the capital raising, said earlier in the morning that shareholders subscribed to buy 124 million 
shares in the rights issue, leaving underwriters Morgan Stanley and Dresdner Kleinwort with 1.375 billion shares. 
AIB stocks gained 23c to E8.73, Bank of Ireland rose by 20c to E5.77, Anglo Irish climbed 37c to E5.77 and Irish 
Life and Permanent jumped by 54c to E6.21. Airlines were big fallers as crude oil prices once again began to creep 
up after disappointing talks over the weekend between the EU and Iran which was attended by a US delegate for 
the first time. Shares in Aer Lingus fell by 3c to E1.34 while Ryanair slumped by 11c to E3.12. Ryanair has 
indicated breakeven at best for 2009 based on oil at USD130 and 5pc yield increases. All of the profits will be made 
in the summer. The key variables are, according to Davy Research, yields (each 1pc change affects net income by 
E25m) and oil (a move of USD1 per barrel changes fuel costs by E13m). Traffic has grown 18.7pc on 21.1pc

we assume revenue of E836.4m, net income of E48.8m and earnings per share of 3.3c," said analyst, Stephen 
Furlong. Elsewhere, reports suggested that Kingspan has decided to postpone plans for a large timber-frame 
factory outside London. Kingspan had suggested previously that it planned to streamline and integrate its UK 
timber-frame facilities initially into one location in the south of England. There had also been the suggestion that a 
second plant in the north of England would be commissioned at a later date. Kingspan shares jumped by 31c to

News In Brief
## Sales of life and pensions products dropped 23 per cent in the second quarter of the year, new figures show. 
The fall reflects a choice by investors to hold cash and avoid declining stock markets. The data compiled by Dublin 
actuarial consultants, Life Strategies, shows that annual premium equivalent value of new business - the 
benchmark measurement used to gauge activity in the industry - dropped to 819.4 m euro in the second quarter of 
this year, from 1 billion euro for the same period last year. Sales of single premium or lump sum life and pensions 
products fell 43 per cent to 2.7 billion euro in the same three-month period. Sales in the life business fell 45 per cent 
during the second quarter period from April to June, while pensions dropped 6 per cent. - Irish Times
## The government is to stop paying dole payments directly into claimants' bank accounts in an effort to curb fraud 
by foreign and Irish workers who have quite Ireland and are living abroad. An investigation by the Department of 
Social and Family Affairs found that almost 10pc of people on the live register were claiming benefits while living 
outside the country. Claimants will now have to collect payments at the post office every week. - Irish Independent 
 ## Domino's Pizza, which has 49 stores in Ireland, has reported pre-tax profits of £9.7m for the first six months of 
the year, up 17pc on the same period a year earlier. Total sales grew by almost 20pc to £170.2m. Stripping out the 
effect of 25 new stores opened in the period, sales were up 11.4pc. All of its outlets are operated through 
franchises. - RTE ## More than 700 new jobs will be created through a 210m euro commercial development in 
Cork, according to Owen O'Callaghan. The developer will formally submit a planning application for the Anderson's 
Quay project today with Cork City Council. The 14,864sq m development would provide office and commercial units 
within walking distance of Cork city centre. The project will also create 700 permanent jobs and 350 construction 
industry jobs during its development phase. - Irish Examiner ## The ESB has defended its decision to discontinue 
the option of paying by credit card for its two million electricity subscribers. The company has told about 19,000 
Life and pensions sales down 23pc in Q2
customers who were debiting their electricity bills against their credit card that they must henceforth use alternative 
methods of payment. A spokeswoman said the facility had been withdrawn to save money: "The business must 
explore the most cost-effective payment channels to keep costs to our customers at a minimum". - Irish Times ## 
Ryanair and Aer Lingus are seeking to recoup 1m euro from the Irish Aviation Authority to reimburse them for 
compensation they paid passengers during the recent radar related holdups. Over 35,000 passengers were either 
delayed, or had their flights cancelled, between July 9 and July 13 when Dublin Airport's radar system failed. Under 
EU law, passengers who are delayed for more than two hours are entitled to free meals and, where necessary, free 
accommodation. As the passenger's contract is with the airline, the airline must foot the bill. Ryanair and Aer Lingus 
say the IAA, which is in charge of air traffic control, should foot the bill. A spokeswoman for the IAA said it had not 
made a decision on whether it would foot the airlines' compensation bills. - Irish Independent ## Workers should be 
allowed to earn an increased amount before tax according to ISME, the representative body for small and medium 
firms. The body said if the Government is serious about addressing the needs of those on low pay, it should 
introduce an incomes policy that would include targeted reductions of PRSI for employers. ISME is proposing a 
policy that will allow workers earn an income of up to 25,000 euro tax-free. It is also proposing the introduction of a 
reduced rate of 5pc for employers' PRSI for salaries up to the average industrial wage of 34,000 euro. - Irish

Ignoring the US evidence that such mortgages were a disaster, many Irish bankers set up their own sub-prime 
lending businesses.
One of the most disheartening financial spectacles of 2006 and 2007 was observing Irish bankers walking towards 
the sub-prime Somme.
Ignoring the mounting evidence from the US that sub-prime lending was leading to sharply rising mortgage defaults, 
some of the best-known business people in the country decided to set up their very own sub-prime lending 
businesses.
Sean FitzPatrick, chairman of Anglo Irish Bank, Lar Bradshaw, chairman of the Dublin Docklands Authority, and 
James Osborne, director of Ryanair, backed Fresh Mortgages, a sub-prime lender set up by entrepreneur David 
Ryan.
Billy Kane, the former head of Irish Permanent, set up Nua Homeloans, a joint venture with South African bank 
Investec, to sell sub-prime mortgages.
Denis Casey, chief executive of Permanent TSB, set up Springboard, a joint venture with international investment 
bank Merrill Lynch to sell sub-prime mortgages here.
Ted McGovern, the former chief executive of the EBS Building Society, set up a joint venture with US sub-prime 
lender GE Money, to provide sub-prime mortgages in the Irish market. Ted Marah, chief executive of IIB, set up a 
sub-prime mortgage division in a joint venture with US investment bank Lehman Brothers.
Earlier, in 2004, David Ingram, a former director of GE Capital, set up Start Mortgages, a sub-prime mortgage 
lender. A sub-prime mortgage is a mortgage issued to a person who cannot obtain a regular or prime mortgage 
from a mainstream bank because the person has an irregular income stream, a poor credit history or even a 
judgment registered against them.
Irish bankers fell into sub-prime trap
Sub-prime lenders charge far more for sub-prime mortgages than regular banks do. In theory, this generates bigger 
profits for sub-prime lenders, assuming the customers are actually willing and able to meet the hefty repayments.
The Irish bankers were hoping to develop the tiny Irish sub-prime market in which US operator GE Money had been 
until then the main player.
The Irish bankers saw that some US lenders had enjoyed juicy margins lending to sub-prime borrowers, at least in 
the initial stages. What they either failed to see or failed to take seriously enough was the mounting evidence from 
the US during 2006 and 2007 that lending to people who couldn't afford the repayments was proving a disaster.
Worse still, the sub-prime mortgages had been packaged into bundles of securities and sold to investors, including 
banks who now found their securities were plunging in value as the borrowers weren't making their repayments.
The result was that the market for securitising mortgages began to dry up, meaning that banks could no longer 
easily raise new money to lend to their customers.
Indeed, it appeared that some Irish bankers were so oblivious to the scale of the problems emerging in credit 
markets that they only curtailed their sub-prime lending when the banks from whom they themselves were planning 
to borrow called time on them.
In the case of Fresh Mortgages, for instance, Credit Suisse in November 2007 took fright at the scale of the 
carnage in the sub-prime market and effectively decided to pull the plug on lending to Fresh.
Extraordinarily, Fresh responded by taking legal proceedings against Credit Suisse's London branch, alleging 
breach of an agreement to providing funding for the Irish company's activities.
So it simply doesn't cut ice with investors when Irish bankers now protest that they have little or no exposure to sub-
prime lending or to the securities backed by sub-prime loans.
The truth is arguably even more troubling, in that many bankers here chose to march towards the sub-prime fields 
even as the body count was rising. Besides, sub-prime lending isn't the only type of high-risk lending in which our 
banks engaged.
Many Irish bankers sold 100 per cent mortgages, interest-only mortgages and mortgages at attractive fixed rates 
which expire leaving borrowers facing higher repayments.
Some, such as the EBS, also sought to jettison certain prudential requirements such as stress-testing the ability of 
borrowers to meet repayments if interest rates rose by 2 per cent. EBS was only stopped in its tracks following a 
high-profile intervention by the Financial Regulator which insisted it stick to the 2 per cent stress test.
Others, such as First Active, continued to relax their lending criteria even after interest rates had soared.
Then there was the question of encouraging people to be, let's say, a little economical with the truth when 
borrowing from their banks.
The Bank of Ireland ran a tongue-in-cheek TV ad featuring students asking a banker for a loan. The students told a 
number of tall stories about the worthy purposes for which they wanted loans, while the ad made clear that the 
students intended to use the loans for other purposes.
The subliminal message sent out by the ad was that the bank wasn't really bothered if students misled it about the 
use to which the loan would be put.
There was anecdotal evidence of lenders encouraging borrowers to overstate their repayment capacity by 
overstating their earnings.
Irish bankers fell into sub-prime trap
But now the property and lending bubble has well and truly burst. And we are experiencing a severe harsh landing 
as property prices fall, interest rates rise and the international credit crunch bites.
The global banking system is suffering the biggest crisis of the post-war era which is rooted in the widespread mis-
selling of US mortgages, particularly sub-prime mortgages, many of them sold to people who either lied about or 
were encouraged to lie about their incomes.
Many of these liar loans were sold to investors in the form of securities which have plunged in value due to the 
inability of the original borrower to meet the hefty payments on his unaffordable loan.
The result is that some banks have been collapsing at huge expense to taxpayers in the US and Britain, the cost of 
finance has soared, curtailing spending by businesses and consumers and driving economies into severe 
downturns, while regulators and politicians are suffering sleepless nights as they seek to sort out the financial and 
economic mess.
And while all this is happening in the full glare of the national and international media, some in the financial services 
community here appear not to have learned their very recent history lesson.
Incredibly, Paul Murphy, a reporter with RTE's Prime Time, was in recent weeks advised to artificially boost his 
income in order to secure a sub-prime mortgage when he visited the Irish Mortgage Corporation in an undercover 
operation using a hidden camera.
The Irish Mortgage Corporation, which is one of the largest mortgage brokers in the country, has launched an 
investigation into the matter.

Comment: Desmond could be the right man for Aer Lingus
Comment: Desmond could be the right man for Aer Lingus

It is difficult not to get excited at the prospect, reported last week, of billionaire financier Dermot Desmond being 
offered the chairman's job at Aer Lingus.
Desmond, a notoriously private figure, has developed an impressive reputation for intrigue whenever he gets 
involved in the affairs of a quoted Irish company.
His previous exploits, which include using a 22 per cent stake in Greencore to sensationally block the re-
appointment of chairman Bernie Cahill (ironically, a former holder of the chairman's job at Aer Lingus) and building 
a similar stake in radiator manufacturer Barlo to thwart a management buyout by its then chief executive, Tony 
Mullins, are now part of Irish corporate folklore.
Desmond's potential arrival at Aer Lingus throws up a host of possibilities for further intrigue. First and foremost, he 
ismore a dealmaker than a passive steward of board meetings. Could he be the man to steer the board towards a 
radical change in approach to Ryanair, the airline's number one shareholder?
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has repeatedly argued that Aer Lingus is too small to last as a stand-alone entity, 
and that agreeing to a Ryanair takeover would be its best option. Current chairman John Sharman, now nearing the 
end of his term, was too vocal in his attempts to see off Ryanair's original bid to perform a U-turn now, but a new 
man could be more flexible.
Desmond's previous experience as Aer Rianta (now the Dublin Airport Authority) chairman arms him with a 
valuable inside track on government thinking, perhaps to gauge its appetite for a deal with Ryanair that would see it 
cash in its current 25 per cent shareholding.
His previous associations with telecoms entrepreneur Denis O'Brien could also come in handy, given O'Brien's 2 
per cent stake in the airline, originally acquired to help block O'Leary's initial bid.
Comment: Desmond could be the right man for Aer Lingus
This is all speculation of course, but with Aer Lingus's share price now less than half the level at which Ryanair 
offered to buy the airline, and a global economic downturn and astoundingly high oil prices biting hard, Desmond 
could find himself in the right place at the right time.
Perhaps the best clues are to be found at Ireland's racecourses. If one of O'Leary's horses loses out to a Desmond-
owned beast down the line, the odds of a rapprochement could be slashed.
Bank shares
Irish bank stocks enjoyed a remarkable two days, with sharp rises in share prices giving everyone a lift. While one 
swallow doesn't make a summer, and two good days don't make a turnaround, the extent of the rises in bank share 
prices last week gave some room for encouragement.
However, most analysts agree that those gains could be eroded with the next big piece of bad news somewhere.
All the while, speculation has been mounting about consolidation in the Irish banking sector. It is hard to imagine 
anybody buying anybody amid all the uncertainty, but Bank Santander didn't waste any time snapping up Alliance & 
Leicester in Britain.
Relatively unaffected by the credit crunch, Santander may take a look at the Irish market. It has already been 
identified as a potential buyer of Bank of Ireland.
However, the latest rumours in the Irish market are suggesting that AIB could take a look at Irish Life & Permanent. 
AIB's current market capitalisation is  7.5 billion compared to IL&P's  1.5 billion.
Of course, a move on IL&P could also be a protective mechanism for AIB itself. There's nothing like complicating 
the business mix a bit to make bigger fish look somewhere else.

A full-blown rebound on the Dublin shares market got under way as banking stocks continued to make impressive 
headway amid growing confidence that the global market turbulence is stabilising.
The ISEQ rose by 220.68 points to 4,894.7.
The volatility that has marked Irish shares trading, with the ISEQ plunging at record speed and then bouncing back 
sharply, is mirrored across the globe in both equities and commodities markets.
 The latest boost came from a better than expected quarterly report from banking giant, Citigroup, which posted a 
USD2.5 billion loss in the second quarter, doing slightly better than the market had anticipated. Oil prices plunged 
by a remarkable USD16 a barrel in less than two days this week. Davy Research points out that the two markets 
are, indirectly, linked with an inverse correlation between the two in that the rebound on shares markets coincided 
with the slump in oil prices and the recent equity market slide saw oil reach record highs. Banking stocks, 
meanwhile, have reacted well to the news from another of the better-performing banks in this crisis, namely JP 
Morgan. That followed Thursday's dividend hike from Wells Fargo, another outperformer. Unfortunately, many have 
fared less well than these two and, according to Rossa White of Davy, the rally will last only as long as it takes for 
the next nasty surprise to come along. Shares in AIB jumped by 29c to E8.49, Bank of Ireland rose by 36c to E5.75, 
Anglo Irish climbed by 56c to E5.31 and Irish life and Permanent took on 49c to E5.16. Diversified distribution and 
business support group DCC has described its first quarter to June as "excellent" with adjusted earnings 
"significantly ahead of both last year and budget". In an interim management statement this morning, it said the 
improvement had taken place despite "the adverse impact of the weaker sterling/euro exchange rate on the 
translation into euro of DCC's sterling denominated profits". It said its largest division, DCC Energy, achieved 
"excellent operating profit growth in the quarter", having been helped by much colder weather in Britain and Ireland 
in April compared to the same month last year. Shares in the group slipped by 30c to E14.20. Shares in CRH 
ISEQ bounce well under way
jumped by 70c to E16.70. US housing starts surged to an annualised rate of 1,066,000 in June, up 9.1pc month-on-
month and well ahead of the consensus estimate of 960,000. However, analysts note that changes to planning laws 
in the New york region had a distorting effect on the national figures. Shares in Ryanair continued to rise as 
investors cheered the latest round of capacity cuts designed to pare costs to the bone. Ryanair has indicated that, 
on certain flights and at certain airports in the winter, it would lose less money by not flying. This is because of the 
airline's high variable costs and low aircraft ownership costs. Following the 12pc cut in the weekly schedule at 
Dublin, Stansted's schedule has been reduced by 14pc. Ryanair shares gained 20c to E3.15 and Aer Lingus rose 
by 8c to E1.35. Irish drugs developer AGI Therapeutics says it believes it is on track to report preliminary data from 
its ongoing Phase III efficacy study for its 'Rezular' drug, in the first half of 2009. Its shares gained 5pc or 5c to 
E1.05.

takes for the next nasty surprise to come along. Shares in AIB jumped by 29c to E8.49, Bank of Ireland rose by 36c 
to E5.75, Anglo Irish climbed by 56c to E5.31 and Irish life and Permanent took on 49c to E5.16. Diversified 
distribution and business support group DCC has described its first quarter to June as "excellent" with adjusted 
earnings "significantly ahead of both last year and budget". In an interim management statement this morning, it 
said the improvement had taken place despite "the adverse impact of the weaker sterling/euro exchange rate on 
the translation into euro of DCC's sterling denominated profits". It said its largest division, DCC Energy, achieved 
"excellent operating profit growth in the quarter", having been helped by much colder weather in Britain and Ireland 
in April compared to the same month last year. Shares in the group slipped by 30c to E14.20. Shares in CRH 
jumped by 70c to E16.70. US housing starts surged to an annualised rate of 1,066,000 in June, up 9.1pc month-on-
month and well ahead of the consensus estimate of 960,000. However, analysts note that changes to planning laws 
ISEQ rebound fizzles out but banks rise
in the New york region had a distorting effect on the national figures. Shares in Ryanair continued to rise as 
investors cheered the latest round of capacity cuts designed to pare costs to the bone. Ryanair has indicated that, 
on certain flights and at certain airports in the winter, it would lose less money by not flying. This is because of the 
airline's high variable costs and low aircraft ownership costs. Following the 12pc cut in the weekly schedule at 
Dublin, Stansted's schedule has been reduced by 14pc. Ryanair shares gained 20c to E3.15 and Aer Lingus rose 
by 8c to E1.35.

Ryanair cuts back winter flights

No-frills airline Ryanair said Thursday it will withdraw nearly a third of its aircraft from its major London base and 
suspend operations at seven other European airports because of sky-high fuel costs and its failure to negotiate 
lower airport fees.
This will be the second straight year that Ryanair Holdings PLC reduces its activities at Stansted Airport for its 
winter season running from October to March, as soaring fuel costs and dropping consumer demand continue to 
bite.
Ryanair said it would operate 28 aircraft at Stansted starting in October, down from the current 40. Chief Executive 
Michael O'Leary told a London news conference he expects the cutbacks to cost 900 jobs at the airport northeast of 
London, including 150 Ryanair employees.
Separately, Ryanair announced it will cancel its services from Nov. 4 to Dec. 19 at seven destinations: Basel in 
Switzerland; the Hungarian capital, Budapest; the Polish cities of Krakow and Rzeszow; Palma and Valencia in 
Spain; and Salzburg in Austria.
And the Dublin-based airline warned of further disruptions if those airports don't discount their fees during low-
demand periods.
Deputy Chief Executive Michael Cawley said those bases were being temporarily shut because "high airport 
charges, and the massive increases which we face in fuel prices, makes it more profitable for Ryanair to ground 
aircraft rather than fly them at these airports during this period."
Officials at the targeted airports characterized Ryanair's claims as distorted and cynical.
Domokos Szollar, spokesman for Budapest Airport, said Ryanair pursued no serious negotiations, but merely sent a 
"form letter" to it and several other airports demanding lower winter-time fees before cutting services during a 
particularly slow few weeks.
Ryanair cuts back winter flights
"It's curious that Ryanair is restarting its flights just in time for the Christmas season," Szollar said. "This is not about 
Budapest Airport being expensive, but about Ryanair wanting to save money."
Ryanair said it would operate 14 percent fewer flights from Stansted than during the previous winter season, when it 
withdrew four aircraft its first such reduction following more than a decade of growth at the airport northeast of 
London.
Ryanair said it also was transferring some Stansted-based aircraft to new winter routes, chiefly to Spain's holiday 
islands and Costa del Sol as well as Katowice in southern Poland. While no Stansted routes are being eliminated, 
destinations facing reduced winter flights include Rome, Dublin, and Glasgow in Scotland.
O'Leary blamed BAA PLC, the company that operates all the major London airports, for forcing Ryanair's hand. He 
launched identical complaints Tuesday against the Dublin Airport Authority as he unveiled winter cutbacks at the 
airline's second-largest base.
In both cases, airport managers rejected a Ryanair proposal for them to lower their usual fees charged per 
passenger as the price for uninterrupted winter business.
"Monopoly airports ... have delivered high prices and awful facilities. It is time we allowed competition to deliver 
where monopolies have failed," O'Leary said.
BAA offered no immediate reaction to O'Leary's criticisms, but the Dublin Airport Authority dismissed them.
In a statement, the Dublin Airport Authority said O'Leary's demand for "anticompetitive support mechanisms" had 
been "justly declined." It said the operating expenses of international airports such as Dublin and Stansted were 
"not comparable to the remote former airfields to which Ryanair largely flies."
Ryanair shares were up 1.7 percent at €2.98 (US$4.73) in afternoon trading on the Irish Stock Exchange.

Budget airline Ryanair Holdings blamed high airport costs, UK airport operator BAA and soaring fuel prices for a 
decision to cut winter services from London's Stansted airport and to temporarily close some of its European bases.
Ryanair said it had decided to reduce the number of aircraft based at Stansted to 36 from 28, resulting in a 
reduction of about 14 percent in the number of weekly flights from the Essex airport.
The Dublin-based carrier said it estimated that its traffic at Stansted this winter would decline by some 900,000 
passengers against the same period last year.
Ryanair said Stansted was the most expensive of its 28 bases and BAA, owned by Grupo Ferrovial SA, had 
increased airport charges by 15 percent this year, on top of a 100 percent rise last year.
It also criticised the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), saying it had failed to control what it described as the 
'unjustified' cost increases.
'When a regulated monopoly makes it more profitable for airlines to sit aircraft on the ground, rather than fly them 
through the winter, then obviously the CAA's laughable regulatory regime has failed,' Ryanair chief executive 
Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
Ryanair also blamed the cuts on the rise in oil prices to $140 a barrel.
In a separate statement, the airline said it was temporarily closing its operations at seven continental European 
airports between Tuesday Nov 4 and Friday Dec 19.
The airports involved include Basel in Switzerland, Budapest, Krakow and Rzeszow in Poland, Palma in Majorca, 
Salzburg in Austria and Valencia in Spain.
'Costs at these airports are amongst the most expensive in Europe and far outweigh the potential revenue which 
passengers are prepared to pay, particularly during the off-peak winter period,' Ryanair said.

News In Brief 
## Aer Lingus will be bought out by a major European carrier within the next few years, Ryanair chief executive 
Michael O'Leary has predicted. He says European aviation will be dominated by five carriers within five year and 
Aer Lingus will eventually be acquired British Airways, Air France-KLM or Deutsche Lufthansa. "Who do you want 
to own Aer Lingus, someone in Frankfurt, London or Paris? Or you can have it owned by someone who lives 
locally," O'Leary asked at a parliamentary committee in Dublin. Retaining Irish ownership is vital, he said. Mr 
O'Leary also said there was no future for Donegal, Sligo, Galway and Waterford airports, while Knock was "pretty 
flakey". He called on the government to stop subsidising them. - Irish Examiner
## The number of citizens from the EU's newer member states who registered to work or to access public services 
in the Republic fell by 40 per cent in the first half of the year, suggesting a significant easing of the inward migration 
flow from central and eastern Europe. Just over 40,000 people from the EU's 12 newest members obtained a PPS 
number in the first six months of the year, compared to 66,500 over the same period last year. There was a decline 
of some 40 per cent among Poles and Lithuanians, and the trend appears to have accelerated last month, with 
these countries showing reductions of 46 and 44 per cent respectively. - Irish Times
 ## Capel Developments, which beat rival Manor Park in a race last year to acquire the grounds of Clontarf Golf 
Club, has pulled out of the 170m euro deal as the property market continues to tumble. The company had been 
courting representatives of the golf club since early last year as house prices peaked in Ireland. It finally won the 
majority of the club's members over in a vote at the end of last November. The deal included Capel agreeing to pay 
the club's 670 full members 100,000 euro each, plus 22,000 euro to lady members, 17,500 euro to five-day 
members, and 16,500 euro to intermediaries. In addition, the property developer, which is owned by John 
O'Connor, Eddie Keegan and Liam Kelly, planned to hand over its 150-acre Bernhard Langer-designed links course 
O'Leary predicts buyout of Aer Lingus
at Portmarnock, Co Dublin. Clontarf Golf Club's management were informed on Monday by letter that Capel was 
pulling out of the transaction. - Irish Independent ## The Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, will tonight use the final leg of his 
official trip to the United States to highlight the potential of Ireland as an international business base and tourism 
hotspot. On the third day of his visit to the States, Mr Cowen will hold a series of engagements designed to improve 
links between Ireland and the United States. The Taoiseach will hold meetings with key figures in the US business 
community, including IDA client companies who are current and potential future investors in Ireland. - Irish Times ## 
Interest rates will fall to 3.5pc by the end of next year, Bloxham Stockbrokers chief economist Alan McQuaid 
predicted last night. He said slowing economic activity should eventually dampen inflationary pressures. "With 
activity indicators already at levels which in the past have been consistent with interest rate cuts, we think that the 
next move from the ECB will be down and not up, though we may have to wait until early 2009 for the first 
reduction. Overall, though, we see the ECB's key lending rate running at 3.5pc by the end of next year as against 
4.25pc now," he added. - Irish Examiner ## CIE has confirmed that it plans io introduce pay and display parking at 
37 stations on the greater Dublin rail network. Commuters will be charged 2 euro a day or a discounted rate of 8 
euro a week. The charges come after CIE signed a contract with a private parking control and clamping company. 
The contract will come into force from September and plans will be rolled out through the autumn. - RTE ## Ireland 
cannot meet the onerous emissions reduction targets by 2020 set by the EU unless the most "lunatic" draconian 
measures are implemented, an Oireachtas committee heard yesterday. Prof Richard Tol and Prof John Fitzgerald 
of the Economic and Social Research Institute told the Committee on Climate and Energy Security that a carbon tax 
would be the cheapest and most effective way of Ireland moving towards the targets. Prof Tol said its benefits were 
that it would be uniform, predictable and easily understandable. They both said the target set by the EU is unduly 
onerous. Ireland is only one of three countries, along with Denmark and Luxembourg, that has been asked to cut 
greenhouse gases by 20 per cent compared to 2005 levels. - Irish Times ## Council workers in Northern Ireland will 
stage a second day of a 48 hour walk-out today in a row over pay that will close schools, libraries and other local 
authority services. Unison and Unite said they expected more than half a million workers to strike across the North, 
England, and Wales and warned further industrial action could be held unless a 2.45 per cent offer is increased. 
The Local Government Association insisted that the offer was final and said any further increase would lead to a 
rise in council taxes or a cut in services. The two sides clashed over how many workers supported the stoppage 
with employers maintaining only 100,000 had taken action, representing just 8 per cent of the total work force. - 
Press Association ## Fireworks and dragon dancers yesterday celebrated the opening of a new production facility 
in the Chinese production hub of Dongguan by the Galway firm C and F Tooling. The 7 m euro factory to serve a 
global contract for IBM will build server racks for the China market for IBM and was built in just seven months, CF 
Tooling's managing director John Flaherty said. "In December last year we picked a greenfield site here and now 
it's ready to run," he said. - Irish Times ## CRH America, the US unit of Clondalkin based building materials maker 
CRH, plans to sell 10-year notes in a benchmark offering as soon as this week, according to a person familiar with 
the transaction. The notes are rated Baa1 by Moody's Investors Service, the third-lowest level of investment grade, 
and an equivalent BBB+ by Standard and Poor's, said the person, who declined to be identified because terms 
aren't set. - Irish Examiner

Ryanair is cutting its flights to and from Stansted airport by a quarter this winter, taking around 900,000 fewer 
passengers, it said today.
Ryanair, which last Winter had 36 aircraft based at Stansted, will this Winter cut that number to 28 aircraft while 
slashing weekly flights by 14pc, it said.
The airline this week announced similar cuts at Dublin Airport.
 Once again, it blamed landing and check-in charges, claiming that Stansted, which is operated by BAA, is the most 
expensive of Ryanair's 28 bases. "The BAA Airport monopoly has again increased airport charges by 15pc this 
year, on top of a 100pc increase last year," it said. However, it also said that oil prices that have stayed stubbornly 
above USD140 a barrel was also a major factor in the cuts decision. Ryanair said that it would lose money by sitting 
these eight aircraft on the ground, "during the Winter when fares are extremely low, but oil prices remain stubbornly 
high". "These Winter Schedule cutbacks, which are significantly greater than those of last Winter, show just how 
damaging the BAA Airport monopoly has become to consumers and the best interests of London and UK tourism 
and the economy generally. Like most monopolies, the BAA continues to increase costs at three times the rate of 
inflation, while delivering miserable service and inadequate facilities. Passengers continue to suffer long queues at 
security and passport control and frequent baggage belt failures at Stansted because the BAA refuses to staff or 
operate these facilities adequately," it said.

Spanair cuts jobs to retain 'viability'

Spanair, Spain's secondlargest airline, is to cut about a quarter of its workforce and its fleet in an attempt to combat 
high fuel prices, fierce competition and a sharp downturn in its domestic market.
The loss-making carrier, which is owned by the Scandinavian group SAS, said yesterday it would shed 900 staff 
jobs as part of a "viability plan". The announcement comes a month after SAS abandoned a year-long search for a 
buyer for its Spanish subsidiary, which last year incurred an operating loss, before one-off items, of about EUR30m.
The planned disposal was part of a cost-cutting campaign that included the divestment of SAS's stakes in BMI 
British Midland and Air Greenland. In spite of interest from a range of suitors, including the Spanish flag carrier 
Iberia, SAS was unhappy with the offers for Spanair.
The Spanish subsidiary said it would also cut its fleet by 15 aircraft - from a total of 63 - during September and 
October. It also plans to drop nine routes, including Mad-rid to Vienna and Barcelona to Zurich, as well as loss-
making domestic services.
Spanair said it hoped to cut EUR90m ($143m) from its cost base in 2009. It said this was aimed at "stopping the 
losses, which have been aggravated by the unprecedented high cost of fuel".
Company executives are also concerned about passenger demand in Spain, which they see falling by about 3 per 
cent this year, and as much as 7 per cent in 2009.
Spain's weakening economy, coupled with high oil prices and competition from the low-cost carriers Ryanair and 
EasyJet, is forcing a shake-up in the market, amid broader global upheaval in the industry.
Vueling and Clickair, two low-cost Spanish carriers, last week announced plans for a merger.
The International Air Transport Association last month forecast the civil aviation industry would plummet from a 
collective net profit of $5.6bn last year to a loss of $6.1bn.

Ryanair today said it plans to temporarily close seven of its European bases between November 4 and December 
19 of this year as part of its cost-cutting programme.
The seven are: Basel, Budapest, Krakow, Palma, Rzeszow, Salzburg and Valencia.
The move follows major capacity reductions at its Dublin and Stansted operations as it grapples with higher costs, 
especially oil which is now over double the price of last year.
 However, it also said that costs at these airports were amongst the most expensive in Europe and far outweigh the 
potential revenue which passengers are prepared to pay, particularly during the off peak winter period. Announcing 
this closure, Ryanair's Deputy Chief Executive, Michael Cawley, said; "We very much regret temporarily closing our 
operations at these airports during this November and December period. However, a combination of high airport 
charges and the massive increases which we face in fuel prices, makes it more profitable for Ryanair to ground 
aircraft rather than fly them at these airports during this period."

Body
A forecast from a major broker that Irish house prices could fall by a further 30pc helped to send Irish shares lower 
again this morning.
By midday, the ISEQ was down 72.52 points to 4,282.10.
Banks and builders were once again the big fallers after Credit Suisse said that Irish house prices could drop 
another 30pc, with declines also in the level of housing construction set to further impact on the level of economic 
growth.
 The report comes on the back of downgrades from Credit Suisse and from UBS for Irish banks, citing increased 
chances of rising impairment loans, the depressed building industry and the general faltering Irish economy. Shares 
in AIB fell by 19c to E6.91, Bank of Ireland dropped by 14c to E4.38, Anglo Irish declined by 13c to E3.95 and Irish 
Life and Permanent plummeted by over 8pc or 34c to E3.73. European stock markets also slipped after an early 
rally in banks fizzled out and investors awaited further testimony on the US economy from Federal Reserve 
chairman Ben Bernanke. Also weighing on construction shares was a predictably downbeat report from one of the 
UK's top builders, Wolseley. Key points from the statement, which covers the 11 months to the end of June, include 
an acceleration in the rate of the decline in earnings; real evidence of a slowdown in Europe, particularly the UK; 
some progress in debt reduction; and a decision to pay no final dividend. Shares in CRH fell by 59c to E14.30, 
Grafton dropped by 7c to E2.60 and Kingspan dropped 16c to E5.34. Shares in United Drug gained 3c to E3.50 
after it said it agreed to buy a US pharmaceuticals packing company for USD99m. It is purchasing Sharp 
Corporation in an all cash deal. In a statement this morning the Irish group said that Sharp, headquartered in 
Allentown, Pennsylvania, is the largest independent pharmaceutical contract packaging company in the growing 
outsourced market in the United States. Shares in drug developer, Elan, dropped by 13c to E21.12. The Athlone-
based firm publishes second quarter results next Thursday with Davy expecting its revenues to rise by 34pc but 
ISEQ down again on house forecast
increased research and development expenditure on Alzheimer's Disease programmes will modestly expand core 
earnings losses on a year-on-year basis, the broker said. Looking at the airlines, Davy said that capacity cuts this 
winter makes sense. Less flying makes sense this winter in what is essentially the art of losing less money, 
according to analyst, Stephen furlong. "This is particularly true if you have higher variable costs and low ownership 
costs as have the low-cost-carriers," he said. The announcement yesterday by Ryanair at Dublin is part of its plan 
to mothball 20 aircraft over certain parts of the winter schedule, he said. Shares in Ryanair gained 6c to E2.81 and 
Aer Lingus gained 2c to E1.22.

Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings plc. called on the European Commission to examine 'unjustified' fuel 
surcharges imposed by 'greedy airlines' on air tickets.
'Already high-fares flag carriers such as Aer Lingus, British Airways, Air France and Lufthansa continue to impose 
and increase their fuel surcharges with the EU making no attempt to investigate it,' it said.
Earlier, British Airways said it was 'absolutely inevitable' that prices would rise with higher surcharges due to the 
soaring cost of fuel. Lufthansa last week also said it would raise its surcharges.
Ryanair lodged a formal complaint over the matter with the commission in October last year. Airlines have said the 
complaints have no justification as there will never be price fixing between rival carriers.
Airlines have also scrapped flights over the summer to cut back on fuel consumption.

FARNBOROUGH, England Etihad Airways, of Abu Dhabi, ordered a total of 100 jetliners Monday from Airbus and 
Boeing Co., reinforcing the oil-rich Middle East's position as one of the few regions where airlines have the financial 
clout to expand aggressively.
With their deep pockets, strong cash flows and efficient new fleets, Etihad, Dubai's Emirates Airlines and Qatar 
Airways are part of an elite class of rising carriers. The club, whose members span continents and business 
models, also includes budget giants Southwest Airlines Co., of the U.S., and Ryanair Holdings PLC, of Ireland; a 
revitalized Air France-KLM SA and Deutsche Lufthansa AG; longtime Asian leaders Singapore Airlines Ltd. and 
Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.; and Chile's multinational LAN Airlines SA.
Their strength underscores the growing gulf between the industry's haves and have-nots. Even with the price of 
aviation fuel more than double what it was a year ago, these powerful players are able to hedge fuel costs, borrow 
money, buy new planes and pamper high-paying customers while their poorer rivals cut routes and seek cash 
infusions. As the weak retrench, the strong are poaching their passengers, further widening the gap.
But some experts say that before the winners truly emerge, the whole industry will, to some extent, feel the pinch of 
rising oil prices and the global economic slowdown. "Before we get to a new world order, we're going to have a 
period of new world disorder," says Henri Courpron, a former Airbus executive who heads the European practice of 
airline-restructuring advisory firm Seabury Group.
For now, at least, U.S. airlines are among the worst-off in the developed world, thanks to the ultracompetitive 
American market, their lower proportion of international flights and the weak dollar. The dollar's weakness puts 
them at a disadvantage to foreign carriers whose stronger currencies make buying pricey dollar-denominated fuel 
less of a burden.
Some analysts believe the U.S. airline industry could post a combined loss of $10 billion this year close to the 
record loss it racked up in 2002. But with oil at about $145 a barrel, the pain also is spreading from Canada to Latin 
America to Europe and Asia.
The strong carriers, meanwhile, are drawing their strength from various sources.
Some airlines take off in stormy times
Etihad and Qatar Airways are owned by cash-rich governments willing to invest heavily without demanding quick 
returns. And they operate in markets buoyed by oil wealth.
Though four-year-old Etihad Airways says it may miss its goal of breaking even by 2010, it continues to plow money 
into expansion. Its orders, announced at the Farnborough International Airshow, for 45 aircraft from Boeing and 55 
from Airbus, a unit of European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co., is worth about $20 billion at list prices.
Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific have prospered by offering lavish customer service and intercontinental 
connections that appeal to business travelers. In their premium cabins, they charge premium fares.
On Singapore's five new Airbus A380 super-jumbo jetliners, first-class passengers sleep on sheets made by French 
fashion house Givenchy, while coach passengers have USB ports for connecting their own electronic devices next 
to their seat-back video screens. The airline, a unit of SIA Group, said its operating profit rose 60 percent in the 
fiscal year ended March 31.
Southwest's discount model in the U.S., has kept it profitable for 35 straight years. The carrier, which aggressively 
hedges its fuel costs, has $3.7 billion of cash in the bank and a market capitalization of $9.9 billion, more than the 
combined market value of the six-largest conventional U.S. carriers.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget carrier, has euro>2.2 billion ($3.5 billion) of cash on hand, meaning it can afford 
to park some planes this winter if traffic falls off. "We're all suffering, but some are suffering more than others," said 
Michael O'Leary, its CEO. In the 1990s, as airline deregulation spread out of the U.S. and nations renegotiated 
treaties that forced carriers to stick largely to their home markets, aircraft makers began developing jetliners that 
could travel longer distances. As the political and technological barriers fell, airlines began pushing more deeply 
onto one another's formerly protected turfs. Foreign and no-frills start-ups began challenging the old-guard flag 
carriers like Lufthansa and Air France and offering new routes.
For its flights from Dubai to Sao Paulo, for example, Emirates depends on filling its seats largely with passengers 
who board in Nagoya, Japan, says Tim Clark, the airline's chief executive. Malaysian discount airline AirAsia Bhd., 
which also has operations in Thailand and Indonesia, offers regional routes that its chief competitor, Malaysian 
Airlines (TEXTLK)System Bhd., doesn't serve.
Globalization has fueled the rise of new regional leaders. LAN Airlines, a Chilean carrier with subsidiaries in 
Argentina, Peru and Ecuador, is highly profitable thanks to its expanding passenger operation and its big cargo 
business.
European leaders Air France and Lufthansa have strengthened their positions by building up their long-haul 
businesses as Ryanair and other European discount airlines have expanded in Europe. In 2003, Air France bought 
rival KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Since then, it has been able to lure passengers away from European rivals by 
offering long-distance connections through its Paris and Amsterdam hubs.
With the cash it has generated, Air France-KLM has hedged its fuel needs for four years into the future and is 
buying fuel-efficient new planes. "We have a little more time to adapt" to soaring fuel prices, says Chief Executive 
Pierre-Henri Gourgeon.
Lufthansa acquired Swiss International Air Lines Ltd. in 2005. Despite high fuel prices, CEO Wolfgang Mayrhuber 
says Lufthansa aims this year to match last year's record profit. He says he now plans to capitalize on rivals' 
weakness and "harvest" routes they abandon, as Southwest is already doing with routes dropped by its U.S. 
competitors.
Similarly, as ailing U.S. airlines pull back on their trans-Pacific flights, rivals are ready to pounce. "Now is the time to 
go in there and capture market share," says Tony Tyler, Cathay Pacific's CEO.

The Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) has hit back at what it called Ryanair's "colourful" excuses for pulling out 18pc of 
its capacity at Dublin Airport this winter.
The DAA said that its charges are among the lowest in Europe and that Ryanair's capacity cuts come from its own 
business environment and not the Airport's charges.
Ryanair, today announced an 18pc cut in the number of flights from Dublin Airport with half a million less customers 
this winter.
 Compared to winter 2007, when Ryanair operated 22 aircraft, and over 1,350 weekly flights, Ryanair's schedule at 
Dublin this winter will be reduced to 18 based aircraft and less than 1,200 weekly flights. This represents an 18pc 
reduction in based aircraft, and an approximate 12pc reduction in weekly flights. Ryanair estimates that its traffic at 
Dublin Airport this winter will decline by some 500,000 passengers compared to last winter's schedule. The airline 
said it was making the cuts because Dublin is the second most expensive of Ryanair's base airports with recent 
rises in landing and check-in costs by the Dublin Airport Authority. The DAA said Dublin Airport's maximum airport 
charge of just under E7.40 per journey is amongst the lowest of all major European Airports and Dublin Airport is 
now Europe's eighth busiest international airport and is not comparable to the remote former airfields to which 
Ryanair largely flies. "Dublin Airport's maximum airport charge per journey amounts to less than half the ?15 cost of 
checking in one bag on a Ryanair flight at Dublin Airport," it added. "Ryanair pays a rental charge of E25,000 per 
year for each check-in desk at Dublin Airport, or total of E750,000 per year. Ryanair generates approximately E40m 
per annum from check-in and baggage charges at Dublin Airport's check-in desks. The E25,000 charge per check-
in desk represents less than half the full cost of providing these desks and their IT and baggage handling support 
systems," it said.

It was another day of carnage on the Dublin market with the ISEQ down 3.21pc as banks again went in to free-fall 
after a downgrade for AIB and continued fears over the future for top US financials.
The ISEQ closed 144.49 points lower at 4,354.62.
Wall Street extended its slump last evening as investors worried that even a safety net set up for top US mortgage 
financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would not head off further troubles in the financial markets. Investors 
around the globe fear that the ripple-effects from the sub-prime meltdown and the resulting credit squeeze have yet 
to play out with worries of more bank write downs and near collapses to come.
 AIB's downgrade by Fitch Ratings was the main focus of attention. Earlier this month, Irish Life and Permanent was 
hit hard by a similar downgrade from a global ratings agency, sending its shares reeling and dragging the sector 
down with it and, to make matters even worse, Fitch ominously said it would issue statements on the other Irish 
banks later this week. Shares in AIB plummeted by 10.53pc or 80c to E6.80 while Bank of Ireland dropped by 32c 
to E4.50, Anglo Irish plunged by over 8pc or 35c to E4.01 and Irish Life and Permanent fell by nearly 11pc or 50c to 
E4.17. Anglo was in the news this morning after it was disclosed that Sean Quinn and his family had bought 15pc of 
the bank's ordinary shares after giving up the CFDs. Economic news also impacted on share prices after the 
steepest fall in 11 years for Irish retail sales and as UK CPI inflation hit its highest ever level. Major fallers of the day 
also included: FBD down 61c to E13.29; C and C down 10c to E2.50; CRH slumped by E1.14 to E14.26; Elan down 
70c to E20.80 and Independent News and Media down 15c to E1.19. Among the small caps, Siteserv has reported 
results for the year ended April 2008 which were broadly in line with estimates. The group reported operating profit 
of E18.7m, marginally ahead of Davy's estimate of E18.4m. Group turnover came in at E133.8m, 10pc ahead of 
forecast of E121.6m and boosted by an extra month's contribution from Deborah Services. Shares in the firm 
jumped by 4c to E0.27. Ryanair shares plunged in morning trade but rebounded after its shock statement that it will 
ISEQ slumps on AIB downgrade
cut capacity at Dublin Airport by 18pc. Investors bought up shares amid growing feelings that Ryanair will act 
decisively to counteract surging fuel costs. Shares in Aer Lingus edged down 1c to E1.20. Shares in lab services 
group, ICON, rose by E1.15 each to E49.30. The firm will release its second quarter numbers next Tuesday. Davy 
expects the company to report its seventh consecutive quarter of 30pc-plus revenue growth, mostly organic. "We 
forecast a 33pc rise in earnings per share to 60c on the back of a 43pc increase in revenues to USD209.7m. As 
with our full-year stance, our Q2 EPS is above consensus (by 2c) and at the top end of the guided range. Our 2009 
EPS forecast is some 2pc below consensus," Davy said.

No-frills airline, Ryanair, today announced an 18pc cut in the number of flights from Dublin Airport with half a million 
less customers this winter.
Compared to winter 2007, when Ryanair operated 22 aircraft, and over 1,350 weekly flights, Ryanair's schedule at 
Dublin this winter will be reduced to 18 based aircraft and less than 1,200 weekly flights.
This represents an 18pc reduction in based aircraft, and an approximate 12pc reduction in weekly flights.
 Ryanair estimates that its traffic at Dublin Airport this winter will decline by some 500,000 passengers compared to 
last winter's schedule. The airline said it was making the cuts because Dublin is the second most expensive of 
Ryanair's base airports with recent rises in landing and check-in costs by the Dublin Airport Authority. However, 
Ryanair's biggest expense is fuel for which the airline has no hedging in place. "With oil at USD140 a barrel, flights 
at high cost/expensive airports like Dublin must be reduced this winter when fares are very low," it added. "Ryanair 
confirmed that it had written to Dublin Airport seeking a reduction in the costs of these flights this winter, but this 
offer has been dismissed by the DAA monopoly," it said. "This is a further example of the DAA monopoly's 
disregard for the needs and requirements of its airline customers. Ryanair estimates that this cutback in winter 
capacity will result in almost 500,000 fewer passengers using Dublin Airport this winter. However by eliminating this 
traffic - which Dublin Airport charges up to E15 per departing passenger (more than the total air fare in many 
cases), Ryanair will minimise its losses at Dublin Airport this winter," it added.

Ryanair also announced an increase in traffic to Berlin, Eindhoven Milan and Riga. These new routes will start in 
October.
 Dara Brady, Ryanair's Head of Advertising said: "Ryanair's low fares in Sweden have been a tremendous success 
because Swedish passengers can't stand SAS's high fares and fuel surcharges. With these new routes Ryanair will 
carry 2.5 million passengers annually to and from Stockholm Skavsta for a small fraction of SAS's high fares,

Ryanair today said it has cancelled all scheduled flights to and from City of Derry Airport on Wednesday and 
Thursday of this week due to strike action by airport workers.
The strike is part of a Province-wide action by public service workers over pay.
Up to 30 flights will be grounded if airport workers participate in a planned walk out.
 The latest aviation crisis comes as Dublin Airport continues to deal with a serious backlog following a air traffic 
radar failure which resulted in major delays on Wednesday. Talks are believed to ongoing in order to prevent 
closure of the airport during the height of the holiday season in Northern Ireland.

It was not that long ago that the term ''soft landing'' was being thrown around like a company credit card at after-
work drinks.
Despite the admirable optimism displayed for so long by those plying their trade on the back of a buoyant property 
market, however, glum shareholders in housebuilder Abbey and DIY group Grafton were unable to find the term 
anywhere in their companies' respective announcements last week.
Abbey executive chairman Charles Gallagher, who announced a 60 per cent slump in full-year profits, warned of a 
''wrenching adjustment'' in the housebuilding industry in the not-too-distant future unless conditions improved 
sharpish.
He said builders were quickly becoming ''collateral damage'' - in other words, meat in a sandwich between banks 
that won't lend and prospective housebuyers that won't borrow.
Meanwhile, Grafton's trading update for the six months to June reported a 12 per cent drop in revenues, although 
its Irish businesses suffered an even more worrying fall-off of 16 per cent.
As for the soft landing? ''The correction in the volume of housing starts and completions has been faster and deeper 
than expected'', the company said. This had resulted in a ''more challenging'' market.
Despite the wordplay, the markets have delivered an unequivocal verdict on both companies. Both have seen their 
market capitalisations implode by almost 80 per cent. Both are watching their share prices trade at levels not seen 
for years; in Abbey's case, its shares last traded at last week's levels way back in 2000. Abbey and Grafton are not 
alone.
Comparable stocks, such as McInerney and Kingspan, have also plummeted, while the four quoted banks, a decent 
proxy for the housing market given their level of exposure to property-related lending, have provided equally 
unwelcome baths for investors.
Comment: Comfort in short supply for company shareholders
The soft landing has met with a hard ending. Just like the company credit cards, it is nowhere to be seen these 
days.
Ryanair Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary is unlikely to be too upset that he failed last week in his court attempt to 
force the Financial Regulator to investigate Aer Lingus over alleged breaches of market abuse rules.
The High Court threw out the case, which centred on O'Leary's unhappiness with Aer Lingus informing the 
government of its decision to axe the Shannon-Heathrow route before telling other shareholders. It found that it was 
up to the regulator to decide what cases it pursued.
If O'Leary is genuinely aggrieved about the outcome, perhaps he could go through a simpler process to make his 
displeasure known to Aer Lingus boss Dermot Mannion.
Mannion and his team conduct regular roadshows to field questions from major shareholders (of which Ryanair is 
the largest).This avenue would have been less expensive than the cost-obsessed O'Leary's decision to hire lawyers 
and go down the legal route.
Failing that, O'Leary could always exercise his right as a shareholder to call an egm (successfully, this time) and 
seek an explanation from Mannion in front of other investors. The fast-approaching silly season would be an ideal 
opportunity.

IAA may face cost of airport radar chaos

The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) may be liable for costs incurred by airlines during last week's failure of Dublin 
Airport's radar system, according to the Commission for Aviation Regulation.
The radar system shut down for an hour last Wednesday, with resulting flight cancellations and delays affecting 
tens of thousands of travellers.
A faulty piece of hardware in the system was replaced, but the IAA kept flight capacity at between 70 and 80 per 
cent until this weekend for safety reasons. This caused shorter delays to many outbound and inbound flights.
Regulator Cathal Guiomard said that, under European Commission (EC) regulation 261, airlines facing costs for 
delays or cancellations were entitled to seek recompense from the party responsible.
''We have received a letter from Ryanair raising a number of points and asking whether we will force the IAA to bear 
the brunt of the cost incurred by them last week," he said.
''The issue is complex, however, and the airlines must first raise the matter with the IAA. What may come into play 
here is whether the airlines have contracts with the IAA about service provision, and what happens in the case of 
service failure.
''Eurocontrol collects payment from airlines for about 20 different air traffic control systems, so the controversial 
issue will be whether the service delivered [by the IAA] was to the standard one would be expected to deliver for 
this price,'' Guiomard said.
Both Ryanair and Aer Lingus confirmed that they paid an annual fee to the IAA for its services, but would not say 
whether they had any contract with the IAA for the provision of these, or whether a disclaimer for system failure was 
included in any contract. The regulator has set a fee of  2.28 per tonne carried by the airlines annually, which is 
payable to the IAA.
IAA may face cost of airport radar chaos
It is likely that any airlines seeking costs would look for a reimbursement of part of this fee, according to industry 
sources.
IAA spokeswoman Lilian Cassin she said did not know if the authority was liable for costs or not.
''Our main focus is getting the system back to full capacity," she said. ''We have not yet received any 
communication from the regulator or the airlines - but that is not to say that we won't."
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has vowed to present the authority with a six-figure bill, while an Aer 
Lingus spokeswoman said the company was ''considering all its options'' in relation to recouping costs.

Seamus Brennan will always be remembered for his role in the 1977 general election.
New to politics and only 29, he gave Fianna Fáil the burst of life it needed. He was credited with bringing US-style 
pzazz to the Irish elections. Tipped in the 1980s as a possible party leader and Taoiseach, Brennan was popular 
with colleagues and constituents.
Although active in politics as a teenager, he was formally induced in 1973 when Jack Lynch recruited him as Fianna 
Fáil's youngest-ever secretary-general, aged 25. For Brennan, a qualified accountant and economist, this was the 
beginning of a life-long vocation.
After 1977, Brennan became a senator. After four years in the Senate, he was elected to the Dáil for the 
constituency of Dublin South. For many, he was a rock in unstable times.
The only time anyone ever doubted Brennan's devotion to Fianna Fáil was when he became a member of the Gang 
of 22 - the group within Fianna Fáil that were looking to 'oust the boss', Charlie Haughey - from 1982 to 1983. 
During this period, he was close to Des O'Malley and was involved in early talks about the formation of the 
Progressive Democrats.
Despite much persuading, however, Brennan decided to stick with Fianna Fáil. After the 1989 elections, Brennan 
and Charlie McCreevy were given the job of negotiating a coalition with the PDs.
Although Brennan always said he wanted to be Minister for Finance, he worked hard in all positions. The first of 
these was minister of state with responsibility for trade and marketing.
In 1989, he entered cabinet as Minister for Transport and Tourism. Two years later, his responsibilities were 
expanded to include communications. It was during this period that he made moves towards breaking up state 
monopolies, one of his most contentious policies.
Distinguished career in politics
By removing operating rights from three Aer Lingus routes and granting them to Ryanair, he opened up Irish air 
transport to competition.
''It is no exaggeration to say that, without Seamus Brennan's vision in the early 1980s, Ryanair would not exist 
today," said Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, last week.
In 1992, Brennan became Minister for Education and issued a Green Paper promising to phase out small schools 
and increase assessment and testing. That year, Brennan opposed a coalition with Labour.
When the Fianna Fáil-Labour coalition came to power, Haughey overlooked him in favour of a Labour TD, leaving 
Brennan as minister of state at the Department of Enterprise and Employment.
From 1994 to 1997, Fianna Fáil was in opposition and Bertie Ahern made Brennan the party spokesman for 
transport, commerce and energy. When the party returned to power in coalition with the PDs, Ahern asked Brennan 
to become government chief whip. Much of his energy over this period was consumed with trying to keep the 
independents onside.
In 2002, Brennan was made Minister for Transport. He and Ahern clashed over the following two years, as the 
Taoiseach sided with the trade unions which were opposed to the break-up of monopolies. He was subsequently 
moved to Social and Family Affairs.
Last year, Brennan's negotiating skills came into play again when he had a key role in persuading the Greens to 
help form the government. He was rewarded by the Taoiseach with a cabinet position as Minister for Arts, Sports 
and Tourism.
However, due to his deteriorating health, he asked not to be considered for reappointment when Cowen formed his 
new cabinet. Brennan is survived by his wife, Ann, and their two sons and four daughters.

With dwindling congregations and rising costs, the Church of England faces a financially parlous future. What does 
the Church have to do to stay in business?

Blue Sky Thinking From Mcbainey & Acronym
By John Kay
To: The Chief Executive, CE International plc
(formerly the Church of England)
From: McBainey and Acronym, Management Consultants to
Saints and Sinners
Our philosophy: I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strewed: Matthew 25: 26
Staff morale is low and customer ratings of the corporation are poor. Both staff and customers seem reconciled to 
continued decline, blaming it on the weak state of the overall faith market.
McBainey and Acronym disagree. Outside Europe and bluestate America, faith products are booming. We consider 
the perception of market decline to be mainly a result of the weak performance of established producers, 
particularly CE and Vatican International. Although CE's brand recognition is high, brand identity is weak.
Our focus groups revealed an apparent paradox: although weakening brand values broadens customer appeal in 
the short run, in the medium to long term only challenging faiths sustain customer loyalty. Vatican's predecessor, 
Church Universal, discovered this in the 16th century: the sale of indulgences generated considerable short-term 
revenue but led to massive haemorrhaging of market share in northern Europe. Your company's image has always 
been blurred relative to Vatican's. The first executive chairman, Henry VIII, failed to establish a clear strategic 
direction and this legacy has persisted.
A Religion In Recession - Part II
The brand image issue is fundamental. Even though Islamicorp's brand attributes received very negative ratings 
from our panel - only Ryanair has recorded lower scores - Islamicorp products are gaining market share (as indeed 
are Ryanair's). We strongly urge a clear and strong affirmation of brand values - a creed, in marketing jargon.
The strength of brand values may be more important than what they are. We recognise that "the Tory party at 
prayer" may no longer be an appropriate slogan for CE International. But successful religious brands in today's 
market are mostly rightwing and authoritarian. We observe some tension in CE between the expectations and views 
of staff and of customers.
Although the marketing measures we envisage may slow decline, some reorganisation and rationalisation of 
production facilities is inevitable. We found most of your company's premises wholly unsuitable to the needs of a 
modern business. Many were poorly located, with inadequate parking facilities and crippling maintenance and utility 
bills. We recommend that you negotiate wholesale disposal to a tourist-focused business such as the National Trust 
or English Heritage.
Joint ventures with property developers could exploit the obvious synergies between Sunday church attendance 
and retail therapy. We also recommend that you visit the US to see how successful churches have achieved 24/7 
utilisation of their premises. Many of the facilities we visited were in use for only three or four hours a week.
Customer service was deficient in many respects. The one-to-one customer interface - often described as pastoral 
work - was generally sympathetically handled, but the management of larger groups was old-fashioned and 
amateur. Few of your representatives made proper use of presentational aids, many outlets lacked broadband 
access. Some outlets even produced music in house, usually of lamentable quality.
The average age of staff is high, and while many were strongly committed to the job, others had doubts, and so 
often did we. Their calibre is, however, high, given the low salaries. We were told that sponsorship from local 
landowners and businesses used to be common, but has now been more or less eliminated. We recommend these 
issues should be reopened.
Assessment procedures fall far short of our expectations for a lively 21st-century organisation. We recommend a 
training programme, including financial management, fund-raising and human relations elements, for all staff 
expected to reach bishop-grade or above. We also recommend an early retirement scheme for poor performers. 
Some of the personnel we interviewed acted as if they had already taken early retirement.
We recognise that these changes may be uncomfortable for many within CE International, but believe a restored 
emphasis on shareholder value is true to the message of your founder in Matthew 25:30: "cast ye the unprofitable 
servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth". McBainey and Acronym have 
consultants available with extensive experience of weeping and gnashing.
New Questions For The Old Religion
By Richard Tomkins
When people think of the scandal surrounding the death of Roberto Calvi, "God's banker", found hanging from 
Blackfriars Bridge in 1982, many see the Roman Catholic Church as not only rich, but financially opaque. The 
Catholic Church in England and Wales, however, receives no assistance from Rome, nor does it have hidden 
treasures, having lost its assets during the reign of Henry VIII.
After the Church of England was declared the state religion, Roman Catholics were subjected to increasing 
penalties, especially after the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The old religion was kept alive by members of the gentry 
and nobility, worshipping in private chapels.
Catholics eventually won back religious freedom in 1832 and the Catholic hierarchy of bishops and dioceses was 
restored by the Pope in 1850. However, the church's assets were not returned. Instead, the Catholic Church had to 
A Religion In Recession - Part II
be rebuilt by its adherents, who turned out to be an odd alliance between a few English toffs and a vastly larger 
number of poor Irish Catholics who poured into Britain during the 19th and 20th centuries.
Today, the Catholic Church and the Church of England attract an almost identical number of congregants: the 
Church of England reported a usual Sunday attendance of 871,000 for 2006 while, according to Christian 
Research, the Catholic Church in England had a typical attendance of 869,221 at Mass. But their revenues are very 
different.
Although the Catholic Church has no central accounts, the Financial Times obtained the annual reports of all 22 
Catholic dioceses in England and Wales for the year ending either December 2006 or March 2007, added together 
the numbers and found the church's annual revenues totalled £279m - about a quarter of the £1bn the Church of 
England brings in.
The Catholic Church can get by on only a quarter of the Church of England's income because it is less than a 
quarter the size. It has well under a quarter as many churches - only 3,200 in England - and most of them are much 
newer than the Church of England's so are cheaper to maintain. It also has fewer and less well-paid clergy than the 
Church of England, many of them without pensions, and much lower administration costs.
As a result, the Catholic Church has no need of an income stream from historical assets and its churchgoers need 
to contribute far less. The main source of income is the offertory at mass, from which dioceses typically report 
contributions of around £2.50 per person per week - a fraction of the £8.62 being contributed by Church of England 
members on planned giving schemes.
In a sense, the Catholic Church presents a model of what a slimmed-down Church of England might look like with 
far fewer churches to support. But if the Catholic Church looks in better financial health, it is not without problems of 
its own. Catholic attendances have fallen even faster than the Church of England's in recent years: between 1980 
and 2005, they fell by 49 per cent in England compared with the Church of England's 36 per cent, according to 
Christian Research.
An even more pressing problem for the Catholic Church is the shortage of priests. Most are old and it has become 
very difficult to replace them as they retire: unlike the Church of England, which admits ministers of either sex and 
allows them to marry, the Catholic Church admits only men and demands celibacy. The shortage of clergy means 
the Church is having to merge parishes, and many priests are working well after retirement age in an effort to keep 
services going.

Thomas Cook's Condor sale off

Thomas Cook hinted yesterday it might be lining up a fresh buyer offor its Condor charter airline after the collapse 
of a deal to sell the carrier to Air Berlin.
Thomas Cook and Air Berlin issued statements saying their deal agreed last September had been cancelled by 
mutual agreement.
Thomas Cook added it was suspending its share buy-back programme because it was pursuing other options for 
Condor. Under stock market rules, companies in possession of material information have to refrain from trading in 
their own shares.
A new deal for Condor could be secured by the end of October, people close to the situation said.
However, they discounted reports that Thomas Cook was in talks to add Condor to the proposed airlines deal 
between Tui's Tuifly and Germanwings, owned by Lufthansa.
Shares in Thomas Cook, which suffered a 9 per cent fall on Thursday, yesterday lost a further 5.23 per cent to 
174p. The shares have tumbled 45 per cent from a 2008 high of 318p on concerns over the impact of the economic 
downturn on consumer spending.
Air Berlin, Germany's second biggest airline and a competitor of Ryanair and Easyjet in the low-cost market, 
blamed "the significantly changed economic framework conditions" since September - including a doubling of the 
price of jet fuel - for pulling the deal.
Condor, a 35-plane fleet whose seats were partly sold on the open market, would have cost Air Berlin about 
EUR500m (£399m). It made EUR65m in pre-tax earnings and has EUR350m of debt.
The collapse of the deal also means bankers will reduce Thomas Cook's EUR1.8bn credit facility, refinanced in 
May, by EUR320m.
Thomas Cook's Condor sale off
The proposed deal envisaged Thomas Cook retaining a stake of up to 29.9 per cent and the merger creating 
Europe's fifth biggest airline, providing its owners with EUR70m in synergies.
The terms of the cash and shares deal envisaged Air Berlin paying about EUR120m in cash, but with its share price 
plummeting from about EUR13 a share to EUR3.70 it was faced with having to stump up nearly three times as 
much cash to complete the deal.

Ryanair has claimed that a backup radar system based at Shannon could have been used to replace the stricken 
Dublin system. 
In a statement this morning it says the Shannon system was specifically designed to immediately replace or back-
up the Dublin radar system, in the event of a terrorist or criminal event, or a catastrophic system failure.
The low fares airline called on the Aviation Regulator to explain why the back-up system was not used.
 It called for the dismissal of the Aviation Regulator Cathal Guiomard. "As we enter the busy weekend when charter 
flights will worsen the delays at Dublin Airport," the statement said, "Ryanair again poses the following questions to 
the Department of Transport and the Aviation Regulator: "Why has the Shannon ATC back up plan not been put in 
place in order to maintain flights and schedules at Dublin Airport? "Why has no regulatory action been taken against 
the Irish Aviation Authority despite five weeks of Dublin Airport radar system failures, flight delays and 
cancellations? "Why has the IAA not been able to provide a manual ATC service at Dublin Airport, which after all 
only handles 25 arrivals and departures per hour? "Can the Aviation Regulator confirm that he will require the IAA 
to reimburse the airlines for their costs and expenses associated with providing passenger care for diverted, 
delayed and cancelled flights?"

It was meltdown on the Dublin market today with a black Friday closing one of the darkest weeks in the history of

The ISEQ closed 271.81 points lower at 4,414.80.
Another 5.8pc - worth close to E3 billion - was wiped off the value of Irish shares yesterday as crisis among two of 
the biggest lenders in the US sparked fears that, far from having run its course, the credit crunch will drag more 
iconic banks down.
 Stocks plummeted across the board with banks, which gained slightly in morning trading, rapidly catching up on 
massive losses for the likes of C and C, Aer Lingus, CRH and Ryanair. Abroad, there was near panic selling of 
shares in two of the biggest lenders in the US. Shares in Freddie Mac were down 35pc and those in Fannie Mae 
dropped 27pc following a shocking New York Times report that the U.S. government is mulling a takeover of the 
two institutions. Such a move would guarantee the mortgages the government-sponsored entities own, but could 
leave shareholders with nothing. European shares initially rose on the report, with investors relieved that 
Washington looked ready to step in to save the two massive lenders, which are vital to the U.S. property market 
and economy. However, that quickly gave way to near despair after the US Fed ruled out a rescue and investors 
fretted that the sub-prime induced credit crisis continues to take casualties in financial institutions that had 
previously been considered unassailable bastions of globalised credit. Some analysts in the US have hinted that the 
two banks may be on the brink of collapse - a diagnosis that, if true, could precipitate a major economic crisis. Back

months to the end of June are down 8pc compared to the same time last year. This includes a decline of 10pc in its 
cider division in both Ireland and the UK and growth of 3pc in its spirits and liqueurs unit. However, banks, which 
together with CRH comprise 60pc of the value of all stocks on the Dublin market, resumed their spiral downwards. 
Black Friday as ISEQ plunges nearly 6pc
Shares in AIB collapsed by over 10pc or 86c to E7.35, Bank of Ireland tumbled 29c to E4.65, Anglo Irish lost 42c to 
E4.43 and Irish Life and Permanent was down nearly 9pc or 42c to E4.30. Meanwhile, oil prices hit fresh record 
highs yesterday, boosted by weakness in the dollar and simmering tensions over key producer Iran, which pushed 
the London Brent contract above USD147 a barrel. Oil has proven a major contributor to inflation, which hit 5pc in 
Ireland in June, and has driven 23 airlines around the world in to closure since the start of this year. Oil prices are 
now well over double what they were this time last year with the previously unthinkable USD150 a barrel within 
sight. Shares in Aer Lingus plunged by 8pc or 10c to E1.22 and Ryanair fell by 14c to E2.53. Other big fallers 
included: CRH, down E1.01 to E14.51, Elan down E1.53 to E21.94 and Paddy Power down E1.20 to E17.20. The 
latest CPI data for June provide further evidence that we may have witnessed the end of premium rate cuts for 
motor insurance, according to Davy Research The latest increase of 0.1pc represents the fifth successive month 
without a decrease in the CPI motor index. The index is now down 2.5pc year-on-year, which is a significant 
slowdown in pricing cuts in the cycle and good news for insurer, FBD. However, shares fell 44c to E14.46.

No-frills airline, Ryanair, won a court order preventing a German travel website from extracting information on fares 
from the airline's site for use on its own website.
The injunction, secured against VTours GmBH in Hamburg Regional Court, prevents the company "unlawfully 
accessing Ryanair's website, and presenting Ryanair's flights and timetables for sale to Vtours GmBH customers", 
the carrier said.
Ryanair said the decision was a vindication of its policy banning so-called "screen scraper" websites where they 
"attempt to misuse and or mis-sell details of Ryanair's flights and prices".

European airlines will no longer be able to advertise misleading E1 fares on their websites or in their ads, under 
legislation approved by MEPs.
By the end of this year all displayed fares will have to include all unavoidable taxes, fees and charges, including 
those applied to security or fuel, and optional items such as travel insurance will have to be set out clearly on an 
"opt-in" basis.
The rules, already approved by the European Union's 27 national governments, are particularly aimed at the 
websites of low-cost carriers which often insist on booking only via the internet. The European commission says 
one in three consumers are misled over air fares.
 Low-cost Irish airline Ryanair, in dispute with a Danish consumer watchdog over fares, rebutted suggestions that it 
was targeted by the new regulations. "This is something Ryanair already complies with," a spokeswoman said. The 
Association of European Airlines, a grouping of national and larger carriers, welcomed the move and said 
consumers were getting fed up with the fact that what they paid bore little relation to what they were offered. The 
commission last year found more than 100 airline websites offering misleading prices. Robert Evans, a Labour 
MEP, said the day when airline advertisements "can be a con" were over. Timothy Kirkhope, a Tory MEP, said:

It is unlikely that passengers will be entitled to compensation for flights cancelled as a result of the radar problems 
affecting Dublin Airport, according to the Commission for Aviation Regulation.
In a statement today on the matter, the Commission said this was due to the "extraordinary nature of the 
circumstances".
The statement came on another day of chaos at the airport, where long delays and flight cancellations have 
continued because of problems with the airport's radar system.
 The Commission said that, under EU rules, passengers delayed for more than two hours should be offered free 
food, two phone calls, telex or fax messages, or emails, and accommodation if a stay of one or more nights 
becomes necessary. If a flight was cancelled, they are entitled to food and refreshments, plus a refund or 
alternative flight to their destination subject to availability. The Irish Aviation Authority says the radar system at the 
airport is only working at 70pc of capacity, and will not be back to full operation for a day or two. Ryanair's Michael 
O'Leary has accused the authority of understating the problem, claiming at many fewer that 70pc of flights were 
getting away.

Banks beat a new retreat on the Dublin market this morning, shedding much of their gains of yesterday.
AIB shed 13c to stand at 842 by lunchtime, and Irish Life and Permanent was down by 23c to 465.
Anglo Irish Bank dipped by 25c to 505 after a downgrade by Davy this morning to the bank's predicted earnings per 
share in 2009.
 The broker's Scott Rankin said he had made the cut in the light of this week's news of tougher times at Bank of 
Ireland. Paradoxically, only Bank of Ireland among the banks escaped new falls this morning. By lunchtime, its 
shares were ahead by 14c to 497. The ISEQ index of Irish shares was down overall by 48.54 points to 4,737.64. 
The falls in Dublin were in line with a 55c drop in the FTSE 100 to 5,474 as oil ande bank stocks weighed on the 
market. The decision today by the Bank of England to hold its key regulatory rate at 5pc had no impact on the 
market, having been fully expected. Back in Dublin, the other big movers this morning were DCC, down 22c to

The European Parliament approved a bill Wednesday to prevent airlines posting advertisements for cheap flights 
that hide the true price by excluding additional charges such as taxes and booking fees.
The bill passed without a vote because none of the 785 members of the EU assembly raised any objections.
A European Union report in May claimed a third of people who shop for flights online are being cheated by 
misleading ads and price schemes. In said airlines and other travel companies often add airport taxes, handling 
fees, baggage and seating charges, and a variety of other costs, on top of the prices that first appear on Web sites.
Under the rules approved Wednesday, airlines will have to clearly show the total price customers will have to pay at 
the start of the booking process.
"The passenger has a right to know the actual price of the ticket, including taxes and extra charges," said Arunas 
Degutis, the Lithuanian liberal member who drafted the bill. "It is misleading to advertise a ticket at 1 or 2 euros, 
when the actual cost is actually much higher."
EU governments have already approved the rules which are expected to come into force by early next year.
About 700 million travelers fly on EU airlines each year and the sector draws more consumer complaints than any 
other, the EU says.
The European Low Fares Airline Association said it welcomed the EU measure, claiming its members had more 
open pricing than traditional flag carriers.
"Low fares airlines have the most transparent pricing policies," said the group which includes easyjet, Ryanair and 
Sky Europe.
Such no-frills airlines have dramatically increased their share of the short-haul flight market in Europe in recent 
years, leading the way in online reservations.
EU Parliament moves against misleading airline ads
The European Low Fares Airline Association says budget airlines currently account for over 35 percent of 
scheduled air traffic within Europe, with its members expected to carry over 150 million passengers in 2008.

Air traffic controllers closed the runways at Dublin Airport on Wednesday after malfunctions on their radar screens 
left them unable to identify incoming aircraft, the Irish Aviation Authority said.
Authority spokeswoman Lilian Cassin said Ireland's major airport was shut down shortly before 2 p.m. (1300GMT) 
because controllers could not see the call signs that normally label incoming aircraft on radar screens. It meant they 
had to identify each "blip" on their screens by other means and order aircraft to hold their positions.
The decision forced dozens of flights to be grounded at airports across Europe or, if already in the air, to be 
diverted. The airlines hit most heavily by delays were the airport's two biggest users, Ryanair and Aer Lingus.
Cassin said controllers initially tried to work around the malfunction Wednesday by limiting the number of aircraft 
permitted to land per hour, but opted for a full shutdown because they lacked confidence in the system.
"Safety had to be our overriding concern, and air traffic controllers did not believe their systems were sufficiently 
stable to continue," she said.
She said engineers from the radar system's French manufacturer, Thales Group, and contractors from Hewlett 
Packard Corp. arrived earlier this week to fix the problems, which first began to appear last month. But she said 
they had yet to pinpoint the reasons for the failure.
Later Wednesday, the Dublin Airport Authority said air traffic controllers began permitting aircraft to take off, about 
one every five minutes half the usual rate. No aircraft were being permitted to land an hour after the shutdown 
began.

Bank shares rallied strongly on the Dublin market this morning, pulling the ISEQ more than 3pc higher.
By mid morning, Bank of Ireland had gained 33c to 484, while AIB was up by 35c to 845, and Anglo Irish was 21c 
ahead at 530.
Irish Life & Permanent, which has had the worst of this week's bloodbath in Irish financial shares, mae the weakest 
gains of the group this morning, with its shares ahead by just 15c to 480.
 The ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 173.57 points at 4,833.08. The recovery was seen as largely the result of 
profit taking on short positions, but the mood was also helped by an upward trend on markets abroad. Leading 
London shares jumped higher in early deals this morning, also led by financials, with the FTSE 100 index up 83.50 
points by late morning at 5,524.00.. Overnight on Wall Street, the DJIA ended 152.25 points firmer at 11,383.21,

June 13. Back in Dublin this morning, Elan shares surged by 113c this morning to 2285 and Smurfit Kappa was 9c

Iberia is to lead the long-awaited restructuring of the loss-making Spanish low-cost airline sector as part of the 
rationalisation of aviation in Europe.
The Spanish flag carrier, which launched Clickair, its own low-cost operation, in October 2006, is aiming to merge 
the business with Vueling, the struggling rival low-cost airline, which began operations in July 2004.
Vueling and Clickair made big losses last year in the face of fierce competition in Spain and under pressure from 
surging fuel costs.
Both Ryanair and EasyJet, the leading European low-cost airlines, have moved aggressively in the past couple of 
years into the Spanish market, which has been further destabilised by SAS Scandinavian Airlines's failed attempt to 
dispose of Spanair, its local subsidiary.
Iberia, which holds 80 per cent of the economic interests in Clickair and 20 per cent of the voting rights, is expected 
to become the dominant shareholder in the merged carrier, which will operate under the Vueling brand.
Under the terms of a memorandum of understanding, the two carriers, which are both headquartered in Barcelona, 
would be merged with Iberia holding a stake of about 45 per cent.
The deal will only go ahead, however, if Iberia wins an exemption under Spanish takeover law from its obligation to 
launch a full bid for Vueling, as it would exceed the 30 per cent threshold at which a full bid is normally triggered.
According to people familiar with the group, Iberia would not proceed if it was forced to launch a full bid.
Under the planned terms of the deal, Inversiones Hemisferio, the investment group of the Lara family, which has a 
controlling minority stake of 28.6 per cent in Vueling and which has struggled for months to find a rescuer for the 
airline, would hold 15 per cent in the merged carrier.
Iberia hopes low-cost link-up clicks
Nefinsa, the investment group of the Valencia-based Serratosa family, which owns Air Nostrum, the Spanish 
regional airline allied to Iberia, would hold a stake of 5 per cent. It currently has a 20 per cent stake in Clickair.
Vueling would remain publicly quoted with a free float of 30-35 per cent.
If the deal goes ahead it is expected that Alex Cruz, chief executive of Clickair, will lead the merged group, while 
Josep Piqué i Camps, chairman of Vueling, will be non-executive chairman.
Lehman Brothers advising Vueling and Lazard is advising Clickair.

Trapani-Birgi airport, on the Italian island of Sicily, with the Orio al Serio airport in Milan, in the northern Italian 
region of Lombardy.
The company expects to transport 60,000 passengers on the Trapani-Milan destination in the first year of the flight, 
the company's deputy marketing director for Italy, Giovanna Gentile, said.
The new flight is operated on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. The flight departs from Trapani at 
0855 local time and lands atn Orio al Serio at 1055 local time. The return flight is scheduled to take off from Milan at

The ticket price starts from 14.86 euro ($23.36).
Besides the newly launched flight to Milan, the Irish air carrier currently operates ten flights from the Birgi airport.
As ANSA reported on July 3, 2008, Ryanair launched on July 2 a flight connection from the Trapani-Birgi airport to 
Birmingham. The new flight is available twice a week, on Wednesdays and Sundays. Ryanair plans to service 
30,000 passengers in the first year of the flight.

(ANSA) - Bergamo, July 9 - The Italian airport Orio al Serio in Bergamo, northern Italy, registered 3.134 million 
passengers in the first half of 2008.
The number of passengers serviced at the airport grew by 15.3 pct year-on-year.
In June 2008, the passengers at the airport numbered 607,377, up by 90,000, or 17.4 pct, compared to the same 
month of 2007.
The number of courier flights fell by 4.7 pct in June 2008, compared to June 2007, and the transportation of cargo 
went down by 10 pct monthly and by 2.3 pct yearly.
Ryanair will launch a flight connecting the Orio al Serio airport and the Schonefeld airport in Berlin, ANSA reported

Bank of Ireland shares tumbled by a dramatic 13pc on the Dublin market this morning after it issued a trading 
statement warning of tough times ahead.
It shares were trading by mid morning at just 439, down 67c on the session.
Massive falls in other banks also took place, pulling the ISEQ index 243.77 points, or around 5pc, lower by mid 
morning to 4,615.01.
 The slump came after Bank of Ireland shocked the market with a terse warning that economic growth together with 
the credit crunch continue to adversely impact the bank's earnings. In an interim management statement, the bank 
said the slowdown in the overall level of activity and volume growth is most pronounced in its retail businesses in 
Ireland. "Growth in lending in our UK and international Corporate Banking businesses in the second half of our prior 
financial year has continued in the first quarter of this financial year, though we expect this to moderate in the 
second half of the year. While we expect to increase our customer lending in the current year, we are taking a 
prudent and selective approach to this growth in the current environment," it said. Among other bank shares, AIB 
was down 79c, or 8.8pc, by mid morning to 818. Anglo Irish Bank had sunk by 64c, or 11.7pc, to 483 and Irish Life 
and Permanent was off by 47c, or 8.7pc, to 489. Among other bid movers were CRH, down by 95c to 1532, Elan off 
47c to 2188, Paddy Power slipping 67c to 1871, Smurfit down 18c to 44 and Ryanair dropping 9c to 245.

Irish shares continued to drift southward this morning, with banks making new losses.
Their fall came after a slew of weekend stories about financing problems in Irish construction and tourism 
companies.
The top name in the weekend specualtion was Taggart Holdings, the Derry based housebuilder which is said to be 
in talks with its bankers on a restructuring plan. 
 The company is said to owe more than 150m euro to banks, but insists it can trade out of its difficulptues. Shortly 
after 11 o'clock this morning, the ISEQ index was down 55.15 points at 4,808.08. The fall came despite gains in 
London, where the FTSE 100 was 18.10 points ahead around the same time at 5,430.90. In Dublin, Bank of ireland 
was down 13c ahead of its annual shareholders' meeting tomorrow, when the market is expecting a short trading 
statement. AIB was down 22c to 898 this morning, and Anglo irish Bank was off by 7c to 538. Irish Life and 
Permanent had slipped by 25c to 570. Construction companies were mixed. CRH was down 37c at 1625, Kingspan 
was off by 4c to 566, while McInerney was up by 2c to 39 and Grafton had risen by 3c to 308. Aer Lingus added 2c 
to 124 this morning after traffic data showing a 7.6pc rise in rise passenger numbers for June from a year ago, but 
the carrier's load factor was down. Ryanair added 6c to 247 on foot of its traffic figures released last Friday, 
showing passenger numbers up by 19pc in June, with only a slight drop in load factor. Icon has dropped 50c to 
4600 this morning and bookmaker Paddy Power has gained 30c to 1930. C and C is ahead by 8c to 313.

Section: THE MARKET
Length: 238 words
Body
Ryanair has instigated legal action against a travel website to prevent it from using Ryanair's booking engine to sell 
flights online.
The airline has taken a case through the Commercial Court in Dublin alleging that Bravofly, an Amsterdam-
headquartered company with offices in Dublin, Switzerland and Italy, takes information from the Ryanair website in 
a manner counter to the published terms and conditions for its use.
Ryanair's terms and conditions seek to restrict the ability to make flight bookings on its website to individual 
passengers only. It is understood to be against the practice of ''screen scraping'', cases where other websites 
piggy-back off an airline's booking infrastructure to offer flights to customers without using the airline's website 
directly.
Bravofly offers users of its websites the ability to search prices and timetables on routes operated by a number of 
airlines, allowing them to compare flight prices between airlines and on different dates.
It generates income by charging users an administrative fee of up to  10 on top of the price charged by the relevant 
airline.
Ryanair's website accounts for almost all of its bookings. Chief executive Michael O'Leary has set ambitious targets 
for driving ancillary revenues through the website by encouraging users to avail of other services when booking 
Ryanair flights. These include hotel rooms, car hire, travel insurance, credit cards and gambling.

Aer Arann takes another route
Aer Arann takes another route
Sunday Business Post
July 6, 2008
Copyright 2008 Thomas Crosbie Media Ltd. All Rights Reserved
Section: MEDIA AND MARKETING
Length: 763 words
Body
Heavy investment in online marketing and a focus on convenience for customers has been key to Aer Arann's 
recent success, writes Catherine O'Mahony.
Soaring fuel costs and recession should be worrying the airline industry, but Aer Arann, the smallest of Ireland's 
homegrown airlines, is unperturbed.
It has already achieved a 3 per cent increase in passenger numbers for the first five months of the year and is 
expecting some of its new routes to continental Europe to be 75 to 85 per cent full over the summer months.
''It's hard to say we're in recession when you've got flights to Faro and Malaga from Galway and Waterford, and 
they're 80 per cent full," said Colin Lewis, sales and marketing director at Aer Arann - recently labelled 2008 
Marketing Leader by the Marketing Institute of Ireland.
Lewis has spearheaded a major focus on online marketing at the airline, which has grown over the last three years 
to become the third biggest operator out of Dublin, with 12 new routes launched in the past year as the airline 
moved into the Netherlands, France, Spain and Portugal.
Aer Arann's turnover rose 6 per cent in 2007 to surpass  100 million. It expects to carry 1.28 million passengers this 
year on 600 flights a week. In 2005, its passenger total was 981,000. In 2002, it was 350,000.
The approach has included a heavy investment in search engine optimisation, particularly targeted at British 
customers and focused on areas close to the airports that Aer Arann services, such as Inverness, Edinburgh, 
Glasgow and Manchester.
The marketing team has also sent out more than 4.5million e-mails to customers in the past year, spread across 32 
separate e-mail campaigns, as well as making a foray into YouTube videos and some experiments with a blog. Aer 
Arann is also a fan of the less fashionable end of online marketing - traditional banner advertising.
Aer Arann takes another route
All in all, 50 per cent of its marketing budget goes into online formats. Banner ads are cheap and effective, 
particularly for the British market, according to Lewis. ''We ran a St Patrick's Day campaign this year and got 1,000 
bookings out of it. The cost was maybe  10 per customer," he said.
As a brand, Aer Arann is taking a different route to its market than either Aer Lingus or Ryanair, both of which are 
following a lower cost model to differing degrees.
Aer Arann's pitch is to the higher end of the market and its emphasis is mainly on service quality rather than value. 
While both Aer Lingus and Ryanair will regularly offer flights at  5an d lower, prices at Aer Arann are markedly 
higher, starting at  100 for Faro and  69 for Amsterdam.
Its new design for its planes underscores this high-end message. Aer Lingus may have green and Ryanair blue, but 
Aer Arann's colour scheme for its latest aircraft is a restrained silver, with a design of interlocking circles.
It offers benefits to travellers such as much shorter check-in times (30 minutes before takeoff), no baggage charges 
and - a novelty these days - free newspapers.
''You get a different experience with us than with the low cost carriers. There's not much point in us going out and 
saying we're the cheapest out there," said Lewis. ''It's a myth that customers only want low cost," he added.
''We've been taught to believe that customers want the cheapest flight out there but it's not the way they actually 
behave. They understand that there is a value in convenience if flying from your local airport." Unlike Ryanair and 
Aer Lingus, Aer Arann has not been emphasising its 'dotcom' credentials as a marketing tool, although it sells more 
than 90 per cent of its flights online.
At the same time the company is devoting a lot of time to upgrading its website, which already boasts a slimmed 
down booking system and which is shortly to be redesigned.
Aer Arann is also focusing on building more interest in its new routes and making further inroads in Britain. ''We've 
held our market share in Britain, which is great, but we need to continue that," said Lewis.
Nearly half of its flights are within Ireland but 28 per cent come from Britain into Ireland, and 25 per cent are from 
Ireland to Britain. The new European routes account for 10 per cent of business.
Lewis said the airline was optimistic about business prospects this year and said rising fuel prices worried it less 
than most airlines. Its June bookings are already 18 per cent higher than they were last year. Aer Arann's new ATR 
fleet are so-called ''green machines''; they are smaller than jets, and therefore lighter so they require as much as 70 
per cent less fuel for take off and landing.

Management from Ireland's major airlines will be quizzed about fuel prices and their plans for services to regional 
airports when they appear before the Oireachtas Transport Committee in the coming days.
Ryanair's stake-building in Aer Lingus will also come under scrutiny, and airline managers will be asked if they are 
prepared to enter into code-sharing agreements.
Representatives from Aer Lingus and CityJet management are scheduled to appear at the committee on 
Wednesday, while senior Ryanair and Aer Arann managers will be questioned by the committee on Wednesday 
week. T he airlines will be asked about how fuel prices may affect services, and a potential link between the airlines 
to improve connectivity to the regions will be discussed. T he committee wants to see more competitive services to 
areas outside Dublin.
Frank Fahey, chairman of the transport committee, said he would be asking Ryanair ''about what we understand is 
their attempt to put Aer Arann off the Dublin-Cork route'' and Ryanair's pricing policy for Cork as opposed to other 
routes.
''Most regions bar Shannon do not have long-haul routes, but they are serviced by Aer Arann to Dublin. I don't see 
the point in passengers getting there and having to come through arrivals and check-in, and pay for another ticket 
out of Dublin to an onward destination," Fahey said.' 'It makes sense for the airlines to code share, and this would 
provide a better service for people outside Dublin. We want to know what the Irish airlines' future plans are for 
regional services, and the future of long-haul flights to and from Ireland. We will also be discussing the impact of 
increases in fuel prices and Ryanair's attempt to take over Aer Lingus," he said.
Earlier this year, Dublin Airport Authority and Shannon Airport Authority management appeared before the 
committee to answer questions about the development of the airports and new routes. Later this year, Cork Airport 
Authority and management of Knock, Galway and Kerry airports will be called before the committee for similar 
questioning.

Banks were again at the head of a list of fallers on the Dublin market with banks taking a beating after Britain's 
biggest buy-to-let lender saw its shares nose-dive.
By midday, the ISEQ was down 40.47 points to 4,892.09.
In the UK, Bradford and Bingley's shares dropped to a record low in City trading after TPG Inc. abandoned a rescue 
plan to buy a stake in the bank. Bradford and Bingleyfell as much as 15pc and was 5.75 pence lower at 55.25 
pence, the lowest since the December 2000 initial public offering. The shares traded 0.25 pence above the rights-
offering price in the bank's plan to sell £400m of stock to investors.
 The news sent ripples across european financial shares with AIB seeing a decline of 20c to E9.38, Bank of Ireland 
slipped by 4pc or 22c to E5.26, Anglo Irish managed to gain 3c to E5.67 and Irish Life and Permanent edged up 4c 
to E6.09. Oil prices also weighed on the market in general and on aviation and Irish Continental stocks in particular 
as crude prices hovered close to the psychologically important USD145 a barrel level. Aer Lingus shares fell by 1c 
to E1.22, Ryanair dropped by 5c to E2.59 and Irish Continental slumped by 20c to E16.80. Shares in cement group, 
Readymix, dropped by 5c to E0.75. Readymix says it expects very difficult trading conditions for the remainder of 
the year as it reported a first-half loss on declining revenues. The cement maker has reported an interim pre-tax 
loss of around E10m, which included a E2.7m one-off cost associated with the reshaping of the business. Shares in 
food group, Glanbia, jumped by 20c to E4.90 after it says it had a 'good' first-half performance overall, with all 
divisions performing broadly in line with expectations as market conditions remained 'relatively positive'. The 
international cheese and nutritional ingredients firm said global dairy prices and demand are somewhat weaker 
compared with 2007, but look set to remain above historic trends. Among the small caps, Zamano, the Dublin-listed 
developer of premium rate text message services and mobile phone applications, has warned that its first half

Banks were again at the head of a list of fallers on the Dublin market taking - another beating after Britain's biggest

continued to make significant progress during the six months to June. Elsewhere, housing registrations data reveals 
sentiment among developers regarding commencing new projects remains very weak, with registrations in June 
down 64pc compared to last year and a total of 1,100 units registered in the month. In the year to date, registrations 
have declined 64pc. Building related shares put in a mixed performance with CRH stocks surging by 96c to E16.62 
after Thursday's plunge following the company's market statement that profits will fall in the full year as it struggles 
against the fall in the dollar and weakening market conditions in the US. Shares in Grafton, meanwhile, dropped by 
14c to E3.05 and Kingspan shed 24c to E5.70. Looking at IAWS, Goodbody noted that it has been reported that a 
fund manager who represents approximately 5pc of Hiestand's shares, along with other shareholders, plans to file a 
lawsuit after the EGM scheduled for 19 August to force the company to ask for an improved offer price. IAWS, who 
already holds 64pc of the outstanding shares in Hiestand, announced last month that it was planning to merge both 
companies into a new company, Aryzta, where two IAWS shares and one Hiestand share would be exchanged for 
one Aryzta share. IAWS shares gained 15c to E15.60.

Ryanair has bought more shares in Aer Lingus, raising its stake to 29.82pc. 
In a statement, it says it bought an additional 3.5 million shares in the carrier, lifting its holding to a new level of 
159.23 million shares. 
It did not reveal the price it has paid for the shares.
 The low cost airline failed in a hostile takeover bid for the former flag carrier last year, but has repeatedly insisted 
that it is still interested in taking it over. The Irish Times reports this morning that the seller of the shares was 
property mogul Liam Carroll. The paper says that he sold more than 31 m shares in the formerly state-owned airline 
yesterday at an estimated loss of 20m euro. It quotes stockbrokers as describing the deal as a 'fire sale', which 
would have fetched 40.25m euro. And the Irish Independent has reported Carroll had attempted to sell 5.5 percent 
of Aer Lingus' stock yesterday, prompting a 16 percent collapse in the airline's share price.

Do high oil prices warrant lousy airline service?
Do high oil prices warrant lousy airline service?

Highlight: High oil prices should not be an excuse for the pursuit of wrong policies, writes Adam Pilarski.
Body
High oil prices are used as a scapegoat for the ills of the industry. Often, instead of focusing on real solutions, 
management uses high oil prices as an excuse to pursue or continue bad policies.
\x{2002}This is not to say that high oil prices are not an absolute disaster for the industry. As a matter of fact, since 
2006 fuel has been the main component of operating cost (ahead of labour) in the US - the first time this has 
occurred. Fuel expense in the US, according to International Air Transport Association, rose from about $20 billion 
in 2004 to more than $40 billion, and is expected to surpass $60 billion in 2008.
\x{2002}Higher oil prices must mean higher fares and less traffic, and therefore airlines must remove some 
capacity. \x{2002}This is the time to make the correct decisions. Ted, United's discount carrier, which had no 
reason to exist except to provide fodder for jokes, was mercifully terminated by its parent showing that some sanity 
returns under harsh realities.
\x{2002}The problem is that airlines prefer to whine about the cruel environment rather than fix their problems. In an 
interesting twist, Delta and Northwest are pursuing their quest for a merger because of high oil prices, while United 
and US Airways abandoned theirs because of the same high oil prices. Go figure. In their view high oil prices act as 
an excuse for whatever behaviour they want to pursue.
\x{2002}Ironic Times, the satirical news weekly, summarized the situation with the following headline: "Higher fuel 
prices force airlines to cut back on service, amenities. Say goodbye to trouble-free boarding, comfortable seating 
and delicious hot meals."
\x{2002}I have been arguing for a long time that the Air Canada model of charging passengers for various services 
is an efficient way of increasing airline revenue. Though, this has to be done in a clever way - in line with the 
primary objective of airlines: to provide service. The idea was brought to our attention by American Airlines's 
decision to charge money for any check-in baggage. There are smart ways of raising additional revenue and there 
are ways that are not so smart. Last year British Airways decided to add £240 ($477) to the cost of a long-haul 
return flight if a passenger put two bags in the hold. This policy was instituted after Ryanair's profit rose in part 
because it was charging £7 per bag put in the hold. The former policy worked, the latter infuriated passengers 
(especially when instituted by the world's champion of lost luggage). \x{2002}
Do high oil prices warrant lousy airline service?
We will find out which category American Airlines's policy falls into. Will passengers easily accept it? Or will it lead 
to fights with personnel over whether a bag is small enough to be allowed on board, and flight delays because of 
arguments and unhappy customers?
\x{2002}Do these little insults to passengers matter? Recent surveys show that Americans cancelled 41 million trips 
last year because of the flying experience, which included bad service and the infamous Transport Security 
Administration costing the airlines almost $10 billion. How many fees for bags will that be?
\x{2002}Pricing is another example of where airlines do not get the message. The infamous Saturday night stay-
over pricing proved disastrous, and led to substantial airline losses and customer resentment. This also led to a 
move to simplify fares. Now, using the excuse that it is forced to do so by the rising oil prices, United brought back 
the infamous Saturday night stay requirement, despite the overwhelming evidence that it does not work. \x{2002}
I compared the ticket price I would have to pay leaving Saturday night instead of Sunday morning. A senior 
executive of Continental joked at a public forum that this policy was designed with the purpose of "letting Adam 
show how much he really loves his wife". \x{2002}
This pricing policy was based on the faulty assumption that business people have very inelastic demand curves and 
do not care how much they will pay for their ticket.\x{2002}It turned out that business people do not have very 
inelastic demand curves. They do care about saving money. In the end they spend less and stay away from their 
families more. The outcome is that (business) passengers are unhappy, their families are unhappy and the airlines 
do not make more money. A policy predicated on the assumption of irrational behaviour by the passengers is bound 
to end in disaster.
These failed policies were largely abandoned but are being brought back under the guise of necessary reaction to 
high fuel prices. Raising average fares when costs go up is rational. Bringing back failed pricing policies - that were 
largely the reasons why United lost money and spent a long time in bankruptcy - is ludicrous.\x{2002}But then these 
are the same people who ran the airline and drove it into bankruptcy the last time. Raising fares in light of higher oil 
prices is smart but keeping really stupid pricing policies is not. \x{2002}
Lufthansa followed the same policies. I am going from Washington DC to Munich for Oktoberfest in September. On 
Lufthansa the price is (EURO)2,454 ($3,899) if I return on Saturday and (EURO)654 if I return Sunday. Lufthansa 
provided me with the means of calculating the value of a night with my wife: (EURO)1,800. I wonder if Lufthansa will 
follow other incompetent policies of bankrupt airlines and continue in the same direction. \x{2002}
High oil prices should not be an excuse for the pursuit of wrong policies. By the way, I have not bought my tickets 
yet. There are consolidators, there are non-direct flights and, under worst circumstances, there is the night away 
from home, resulting in an unhappy Pilarski family and an airline no better off financially - except if the airline gets 
some type of psychological income from knowing it managed to upset yet another customer.

Low-cost airline AirAsia has announced first-quarter net profits of $161.3M million ($49.6 million), up 85% over the 
first-quarter 2007 figures of $86.9M million. The airline had total revenues of $535.2M million, a 31% increase from 
last year's $406.2M million. Italian airline Air One has reported revenues of (EURO)749.5 million ($1.1 billion) in 
2007, an increase of 22.6% over the previous year. Air One had a net profit of (EURO)6.8 million, up from (EURO)6 
million in 2006. Indian carrier Jet Airways has reported a net loss for the full year to March 31 2007 of Rs2.5 billion 
($62.6 million), down from Rs280 million the previous year. 
Total revenue for the airline group was Rs94.8 billion, an increase of 28% from 2006. Iberia has reported its 2007 
financial figures, with total revenues of (EURO)5.52 billion ($8.1 billion), up 2.5% on 2006. The airline announced 
net profits for 2007 of (EURO)327.6 million, up from (EURO)56.7 million the previous year. Irish low-cost carrier 
Ryanair says it expects to break even next year - even with oil at $130 a barrel. The airline released financial 
figures to March 31 2008, with net profits of (EURO)480.9 million ($759 million), up from (EURO)401.4 million the 
previous year. International Air Transport Association believes the airline industry could lose up to $2.8 billion in 
2008. The main reasons given are the high cost of aviation fuel and a slow down in the world economy. Blue Air, 
the Romanian low-cost carrier, has ordered three next-generation 737-900ERs. The agreement, worth $238.5 
million at list prices, comes after an order for two 737-800s made earlier this year. Blue Air is based in Bucharest 
and was the first Romanian low-cost carrier Continental Airlines is planning to cut 3,000 jobs and eliminate 16% of 
its domestic flights as the carrier struggles to cope with soaring fuel prices and a weakening economy. Boeing has 
confirmed that the 787 Dreamliner programme is on target for the first flight to take off in the last quarter of 2008. Air 
Astana has firm ordered six A320 aircraft. The airline signed a memorandum of understanding with Airbus in 
December.\x{2002}\x{2002} Brazilian airline TRIP has ordered five Embraer 175 aircraft, with 10 more on option, 
plus purchase rights for a further 15. The list price value of the firm orders is $167.5 million - but if all options and 
purchase rights are exercised, the value could exceed $1 billion. Bangladesh Biman has ordered two 737-800s and 
has purchase rights on two more examples. This comes on the back of orders for four 777-300ERs and four 787-8 
Dreamliners, with purchase rights for four 777-300ERs and four 787-8 Dreamliners. Air France/KLM group has 
ended its takeover bid for Alitalia. The group confirms that talks have been concluded and no further comment will 
be made. Air France/KLM group will concentrate on dealing with escalating oil prices. Air China is to purchase 20 
A330 aircraft, valued at $3.8 billion at list prices. The airline expects to take delivery of the aircraft between 2011 
and 2014. Iberia has withdrawn its takeover bid for Spanair, the SAS-owned Spanish-based subsidiary, after certain 
conditions in the sale were not agreed.
Ear to the ground
United Airlines and US Airways have informed their employees there is to be no merger between the airlines. 
Merger talks had been going on for a number of weeks.
Richard Branson, who controls Virgin Atlantic Airways, is in talks with Brazilian partners to start an airline in Latin 
America's largest country. Branson says: "We know there is a lot of room to grow given the country's size and the 
need to develop the air transportation system for Brazil's own growth." An announcement is expected soon. Boeing 
delivered 126 aircraft in the second quarter of 2008, including 100 737s, five 747s, three 767s and 18 777s. The 
total delivered for the year to date is 241 aircraft, 187 737s, nine 747s, six 767s and 39 777s. The-Jet, a very light 
jet (VLJ) built by Cirrus in Duluth made a 45 minute flight on 3 July. The VLJ can cruise at 350 knots and carry up to 
seven passengers,; five adults and two children. ANA are considering buying five A380 aircraft rather than ordering 
the 747-8. The A380s would be used on routes to Europe and America. The airline is looking at making a decision 
in September. Egyptair is planning to purchase five aircraft rather than lease them. The airline is arranging finance 
to purchase the two 777 and three A330 aircraft Embraer has bought 40% of Embraer Liebherr Equipamentos 
Brazil (ELEB from Liebherr Aerospace. ELEB produces landing gear, hydraulic components and other precision 
equipment.

Highlight: It might look like a mirage, but the hundreds of aircraft Evergreen has stored in the desert are for real. 
Will Roberts investigates.
Body
If someone were to stumble on the Evergreen Maintenance Centre in Arizona, it would surely make for a surreal 
experience. In the middle of the Sonoran Desert, north-west of Tuscon, lie row upon row of grounded, unused 
aircraft baking under the hot sun in a mirage-like scene, resembling some kind of lost aviation civilization.
This aviation graveyard of apparently abandoned aircraft is anything but dead, however. Rather, Evergreen 
operates a highly lucrative commercial aircraft storage and maintenance site, and business is booming. Moreover, it 
occupies something of a unique niche in the aviation industry - it is immune to the cyclical nature of the sector and 
enjoys profit in both good times and bad.
Evergreen, part of Evergreen International Aviation, operates a vast storage and maintenance site, boasting a 
6,800-foot runway, three hangers and maintenance facilities to handle up to 400 parked aircraft. The centre stores 
158 aircraft, including 747s, 757s, 767s, 777s and older DC-9s and DC-10s in what resembles an aviation museum 
or theme park in its scope and variety. 
Evergreen's business is storing aircraft for owners - which include lessors, banks and hedge funds. Aircraft are 
stored for many reasons, including lease transition, ownership transfers, seasonal storage, fleet reductions, 
abandonment and repossessions, but the majority of aircraft at Evergreen are in storage because lessors have 
taken them back from operators at the end of their lease. They are then kept in active storage until new operators 
are found. Some 90% of aircraft at Evergreen come from lessors.
Evergreen's location in the middle of the Sonoran Desert provides the perfect environment for aircraft storage. The 
low humidity and little rainfall prevent corrosion - the nemesis of metal airframes - while there is an abundance of 
open space. Such aircraft-friendly climactic conditions explain why similar storage and maintenance facilities exist 
in the Mojave Desert (Mojave Air and Space Port) and Roswell (AAR Aircraft Services). Evergreen also has a 
favourable financial climate - there are no taxes on parked aircraft in Arizona.
Aircraft are predominantly stored at Evergreen for financial reasons. One factor accounting for a recent rise in the 
number of parked aircraft is the cost of oil, which has eaten into airlines' profits. Ryanair and Qantas have both said 
they will ground some of their fleet to offset fuel costs. 
Good ground
Carriers in the US, in particular, have been looking to retire old, less fuel-efficient aircraft and replace them with 
new-generation, younger models. In December Delta Airlines said it would retire 13 older aircraft.  
With lessors owning an increasing proportion of aircraft, they will inevitably be left with these unwanted, ageing 
models, and the economics of the industry dictate that it can be more profitable to pay up to $50,000 a year to park 
an old aircraft than let it die. This is because lessors are reluctant to write down the book value of an aircraft that no 
longer has much value.
In addition to the cost of oil, the industry is also in a downturn, with aircraft values and lease rates deteriorating. 
Giovanni Bisignani, the head of International Air Transport Association (Iata), recently forecast airline total losses 
this year to exceed $6 billion. When a lack of liquidity and increased borrowing rates stemming from the credit 
crunch are thrown into the mix, the industry is facing challenges from all fronts.
One way for airlines to stem financial losses is to reduce capacity by storing aircraft. John Keating, president of 
Evergreen, confirms that more lessors are storing aircraft at his centre because of these challenges.
"We're receiving about two aircraft a week at the moment but are expecting a large influx in the fourth quarter of this 
year," he says. "Right now we are in the summer peak for air travel, but we will certainly be taking more aircraft 
because of the downturn." Evergreen will be receiving 34 aircraft in October, the majority of which will come from an 
American airline.
As airlines cut their fleet to stem financial losses, it is the lessors that own the aircraft and put them into storage that 
have to pay the price.
"When an aircraft is in storage, there will be a lower financial turnover," says Alan Godson, technical consultant at 
IBA. Godson also draws attention to the negative publicity of having aircraft in storage. "Everyone will be aware of 
what's being stored," he says. 
Such a situation is good news for Evergreen. Although costs vary depending on which storage and maintenance 
programme is chosen, owners pay an initial $30,000 up front and from $3,000 to $4,000 per month thereafter. The 
cost increases for larger aircraft. With profits constituting 10% of total revenues, Evergreen is enjoying a healthy 
financial turnover as the aviation industry is in recession.
Because more aircraft are grounded during a downturn, the number of stored aircraft acts as a useful barometer for 
the health of the industry. Evergreen has 158 aircraft in storage, but is expecting this number to rise to 250 over the 
next two years. Keating says keeping a finger on the pulse by constantly monitoring the state of the industry is 
paramount, and maintaining excellent relationships with lessors is equally important.
Evergreen not only profits from the wider ills of the industry, however.
"We're well in good and bad times," says Keating. This is because Evergreen's business revolves around two 
operations - storage and maintenance. These two complementary business lines act as counter-balancing weights 
on the financial seesaw - when one is up, the other is down. When the industry enjoys good times, the maintenance 
side is up, because airlines need to keep their expanding and busy fleets in good condition, and the storage side is 
down. In bad times, the opposite holds true - storage is up as lessors and airlines look to reduce fleet size or aircraft 
are repossessed, and the maintenance side is down.
"It's a trade-off between storage and maintenance," says Keating. The current ratio of 158 aircraft in long- and 
short-term storage and 11 in maintenance speaks volumes about the state of the industry.
Besides economic hardships, Keating has an alternative theory as to why aircraft are parked. "In my opinion, it's the 
basic economic rules of supply and demand," he says. "Over the last few years passenger demand has been up. In 
this situation, if you decrease the number of available seats, then you can correspondingly increase the price for 
those seats, and if the planes you get rid of are old inefficient aircraft with high maintenance costs, then further 
savings can be made."
Good ground
Sometimes, however, groundings are not voluntary. Leasing companies often send aircraft to Evergreen when 
airlines cannot keep up lease payments or surrender them.
Once at Evergreen, the idea is very much to store and maintain the aircraft while the lessor remarkets it. The 
majority of these remarketed aircraft leave for the emerging aviation economies of China, India and Russia, where 
demand for aircraft is high.
In this aspect, storage centres such as Evergreen play a vital role in the global distribution of aircraft, helping 
lessors to take aircraft from areas where they are no longer wanted to areas of high demand.

(ANSA) - Genoa, July 1 - Passenger traffic at the Cristoforo Colombo airport in Genoa, northern Italy, increased by 
9.2 pct year-on-year for the first half of 2008, the airport's operator said in a statement.
The passenger traffic at the airport rose by 13 pct year-on-year for the second quarter of 2008.
The increase in the number of passengers was chiefly due to the new national and international flights that were 
introduced from the Genoa airport.
Spanish air carrier Iberia Regional Air Nostrum has introduced a flight between Genoa and Madrid, whose load 
factor has reached 75 pct. The Spanish air carrier will operate the flight to Madrid with a 90-seat plane in the period 
July to September 2008, due to its good results.
British Airways and Irish low cost air carrier Ryanair introduced flights from Genoa to London in the spring of 2008.
The airport's passengers will be able to take direct charter flights to Sharm el Sheik and Marsa Alam, on the Red 
Sea, during the summer of 2008, as well as direct charter flights to Djerba and Monastir in Tunisia, Rhodes Island 
and Crete Island in Greece, Ibiza and Palma de Mallorca in Spain.

Just when you thought it was safe for your wallet to start using wi-fi, the Dublin Dockland Development Authority 
has stunned the capital with the most outrageously overpriced service to date.
Launched last week, its new wireless broadband service costs a whopping  3,000 a year, probably the most 
expensive wi-fi service ever seen in Ireland.
Couched in jargon of 'bringing progress' to Dublin's docklands, the new service - operated in conjunction with 
commercial operator 3PlayPlus - will cost a record-breaking  250 a month,  60 a week,  20 a day or  6 an hour for 
always-on access. Totted up annually, that is a minimum of  3,000 a year of always-on access.
Incredibly, this comes at a time when the three major commercial operators - Eircom, Bitbuzz and BT - are actually 
bringing rates down. And some cafe chains, such as Insomnia, are expanding experimental free wi-fi services.
What these operators have learned is that, outside of captive areas such as airports, very few people will use awi-fi 
service for  6an hour. They have also seen mobile operators such as Vodafone,O2 and 3 Ireland come into the 
market with mobile broadband modems for  20 a month.
That  20, though, would only buy a day's broadband with the DDDA and 3PlayPlus.
What adds insult to the DDDA's financial injury is its claim that it has fulfilled a promise to bring 'free wi-fi' to the 
docklands.
For the past two years, the agency has claimed that its ambition was to introduce free wireless broadband to the 
area around the Liffey delta. With this service, it claims to have done so - but only to ten commercial websites. So if 
you feel like sitting down and browsing the websites of dublindocklands.ie, welfare.ie or dublinbus.ie over a hot 
cappuccino and a pain au chocolat, you're in business. If, however, you want to visit Google, Ryanair or any of the 
other 100 million websites out there, it's  250 a month or  60 a week or  20 a day or  6 an hour.
Reality bytes:  3,000 a year for wi-fi in the Docks
The DDDA's complete service will not be finished its rollout until mid 2009. By that time, it will probably be evident 
that very few people are in the market for wireless broadband for  300 a month.
Residents should therefore expect a quiet climbdown on these exorbitant prices before the end of the rollout.

Istria is the most westerly area of Croatia and the largest peninsula in the Adriatic Sea.
It protrudes into the north-east of the Adriatic, just south of Slovenia, and has a particularly strong Italian feel, with 
all road signs in both Croatian and Italian, and some of its older citizens only speaking Italian.
The Croatian authorities are attempting to ensure that the country and particularly Istria - which is its main tourist 
region - retains their historic character. Consequently planning is difficult to achieve.
The Istrian local authorities have also agreed an ambitious plan for the development of a world-class golfing 
infrastructure, with up to twenty courses in various stages of planning around the peninsula. Jack Nicklaus has 
been enlisted to design a course on 140 hectares near the capital Pula; this will be a links course with exceptional 
views.
Thurles-based auctioneer PJ Broderick, who is probably best known for his company Irish Pub Sales, has been 
involved in the Istrian property market for the past number of years.
In Peroj, close to Fazana and the Brijuni National Park where Tito had his holiday home, he is handling the sale of a 
scheme of fully furnished apartments with sea views and a guaranteed rent of 6 per cent for two years.
There are four of the 12 apartments remaining, two each on the first and second floors. They range in size from 47 
to 87 square metres and prices start from  90,000.The Jack Nicklaus course is ten minutes away as is Pula airport

Ryanair did begin flying from Dublin to Pula last year, but shortly afterwards cancelled the route, so Irish visitors 
now have to fly into another airport, further along the coast at Zadar.

Volatility was the name of the game on stock markets everywhere today, with further rises in oil prices leading to 
highly nervous trading.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares began the day with a fall of nearly 1pc on news that oil had reached yet another 
record high - this time of USD 142 a barrel.
With London also down on the news, it was yet another gloomy start after downward slides on Asian markets 
overnight.
 What followed, though, was frantic dealing through the day as dealers tried to find value in commodity shares.. The 
result was widespread see-sawing on markets with waves of buying and selling alternating through the session. 
Gains in heavyweight oil shares provided support in London, balancing new falls in stocks that were vulnerable to 
the cost of energy. At the close, the FTSE 100 index was 11.7 points firmer at 5,529.9, below the mid-afternoon 
peak of 5,553.4, but above an early session low of 5,470.9. In Dublin it was a similar roller coaster tale, with the 
ISEQ index recovering in late morning, only to sink again by the early afternoon. The index eventually ended 64.92 
points higher at 5,295.66. up 64.92 points. The local market's only significant oil share Tullow moved 53c ahead to 
1225. On Wall Street, by late afternoon Irish time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 54.9 points lower at 
11,398.59, with the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index down 0.90 points at 1,282.25, and the tech-laden Nasdaq 
composite index off 10.01 points at 2,311.36. U.S. blue chips were thus extending Thursday's 350 point plunge as 
ongoing concerns over the spiraling cost of crude oil offset some mixed U.S. economic data. Back in Dublin the 
banks had a mixed day, with AIB looking good with a rise of 27c to 977. None of the other financial stocks could 
manage a gain, however. Bank of Ireland ended 6c lower at 584, and Anglo Irish Bank was down 3c to 747. Irish 
Life and Permanent finished the session 29c down at 766, and insurance group FBD was off by 30c to 1860. 
Shares in Ireland's biggest company, CRH, made strong gains after US existing home sales rebounded by 2pc in 
ISEQ closes 64 points higher at  5,295
May, ahead of the consensus forecast. The modest recovery in the housing market is seen as a plus for CRH, 
which earns half its profits in the US. Its shares ended 46c higher last night at 1761. Ryanair shares shed 1c 
yesterday to close at 279 after EU officials agreed to add airlines to Europe's emissions trading system from 2012. 
This will impose a quota of carbon dioxide emissions on carriers and force those which exceed their quotas to buy 
additional permits. Quotas will cover 97pc of historical emissions, using 2004-6 as a reference period. Smurfit 
Kappa shares dropped by 4c to 517 on news that one of its competitors intends to build a major containerboard mill 
in the UK. Davy Stockbrokers analyst Barry Dixon said: "The last thing that the European industry needs now is 
more capacity. Excess capacity will drive down prices and returns for all producers. By the time this plant is 
commissioned , the returns may be a lot lower than those of today's pricing environment."

A director of no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings is joining Irish rival Aer Lingus Group Plc.
Ryanair said its director of scheduled revenue, Sean Coyle, 35, has resigned to become chief financial officer of the 
Irish flag carrier, in which Ryanair has a 29 percent stake.
The budget carrier made a takeover bid for Aer Lingus in October 2006, although it later withdrew it after the 
European Commission launched an investigation on competition grounds.
Ryanair said in a statement that it regretted the decision of any employee to leave, 'but particularly when they are 
joining smaller, high fare competitors'.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said: 'We wish Sean Coyle every success in his new role. We are pleased 
to see Aer Lingus recruit some decent management and hope Sean will introduce some of the changes we have 
been calling for in Aer Lingus.'
Coyle will join Aer Lingus on August 11. The flag carrier's chairman, John Sharman, said: 'Sean has proven 
experience and will significantly strengthen our management team.'

Body
Ryanair has apologised to the head of ICTU David Begg for claiming that he got 75,000 euro as a non-executive 
director of Aer Lingus.
In an interview on Matt Cooper's The Last Word programme last evening, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary mentioned 
that Mr Begg as a non-executive director of Aer Lingus was enjoying such a non-exec director's fee, which was 
more than twice the average industrial wage of 30,000 euro.
In a statement this evening, Ryanair said it accepted the figure was mistaken.
 The figure was actually 45,000 euro, representing an increase of 150pc last year from the 17,500 euro a year the 
post previously paid. "Michael O'Leary wishes to apologise sincerely to Mr Begg, and is happy to correct this figure 
which, at 45,000 euro is just 1.5 times (not twice) the average industrial wage of 30,000 euro," the statement said.

The Dublin market resumed its spiral downwards after Wednesday's brief respite with banks, once again, the main 
fallers and with FBD losing nearly 9pc.
The index finished 185.33 points lower at 5,230.74.
The chiefs of the top four Irish banks have agreed to appear before a parliamentary committee to discuss their 
lending policies and the impact that they are having on the money supply and the deteriorating economic climate in 
Ireland. This is, according to Davy analyst, Scott Rankin, the starkest indication yet that 'official Ireland' has woken 
up to the fact that the economy is in trouble.
 However, investors today concentrated on further afield for reasons to dump Irish financial shares. European stock 
markets fells sharply as another sell-off of bank stocks gathered pace. This followed news of plans by Dutch-
Belgian group Fortis to shore up its finances. Meanwhile, London shares fell in afternoon deals to close almost 150 
points lower, dragged down by a global sell-off in the banking sector following downbeat comments from Goldman 
Sachs and with Wall Street displaying similar losses. Citigroup may suffer USD8.9 billion of second-quarter write-
downs, forcing it perhaps to cut its dividend again, while Merrill Lynch may incur USD4.2 billion of write-downs as 
the crisis sparked by the US sub-prime debacle refuses to go away. And Dublin proved to have no immunity from 
global volatility with stocks falling across the board. The main banks, which, together with building stocks make up 
66pc of the entire Dublin market's capitation, saw sharp declines with AIB shares down 27c to E9.68, Bank of 
Ireland fell by 13c to E6.00, Anglo Irish declined by 29c to E6.66 and Irish Life and Permanent slumped by 39c to 
E8.49. Bank of Ireland has dropped the option of paying its dividend in the form of shares because their value has 
fallen so much. The bank had offered to pay its dividend for the year to March in shares but on the basis of one 
share per each 810c in dividend due. Shares in Ireland's biggest plc, CRH, slumped by 46c to E18.40. Davy noted 
that Hornbach Holdings, the German DIY retailer, has reported a 72pc year-on-year increase in operating profit for 
ISEQ slumps 3.4pc as bank share tumble
the quarter ended May 2008. CRH is the largest DIY retailer in the Netherlands and the fifth-largest DIY retailer in 
Germany through its Bauking joint venture. Meanwhile, CRH's top executive in the US has resigned from the 
group's board, the construction materials supplier announced. Despite a levelling off of crude oil prices on the world 
market, Ireland's two quoted airlines, Aer Lingus and Ryanair saw their shares fall steeply. BA chief, Willie Walsh, 
has told his investors that his fuel bill will come in at E1 billion more than last year and that the British flag carrier 
will be cutting back on capacity. Shares in Ryanair fell by 8.5pc or 26c to E2.80 while Aer Lingus dropped by 4c to 
E1.53. Meanwhile, diversified group, DCC, saw its shares slump by nearly 3pc or 49c to E15.90. Goodbody 
Stockbrokers noted that DSG International, the operator of Dixon's and PC World in Ireland and the UK, posted a 
5pc increase in Irish sales for the financial year to 3 May 2008. However, it confirmed an expected 30pc slump in 
full year underlying profit and reiterated its 'very cautious' view on the outlook for consumer spending.

The Dublin market rebounded today led by a surge on financial stocks but shares in Greencore slumped after a 
E21m fraud was uncovered at the company.
the ISEQ closed 126.96 points higher at 5,416.07.
Banking news - this time of the better variety - dominated European stock exchange trading after financial giant 
Barclays says it is raising some £4.5 billion via an issue of 1.58 billion shares, with Qatar Investment Authority and 
the Qatar Holding chairman taking stakes in the bank. The bank said the issue would enable it to 'strengthen its 
capital base and operate capital ratios that are ahead of its targets'.
 The news sent FTSE and other European shares rising with Irish banks taking their lead. AIB was one of the 
index's top gainer with its shares surging by or 22c to E9.95 having broken through the E10 a share barrier earlier 
in the day. Bank of Ireland wasn't far behind with a gain of 4pc or 23c to E6.13, Anglo Irish jumped by 4.98pc or 33c 
to E6.95 and Irish Life and Permanent rose by 28c to E8.88. However, shares in food group, Greencore tumbled by 
nearly 15pc or 37c to E2.09 after it announced that it has uncovered a major fraud amounting to up to E21m at its 
Scottish bottled water division. In a statement it said the matter involved a deliberate concealment of costs at its 
Scottish business. It said that, as a result, it would have to downwardly adjust its operating profits for 2006 by an 
estimated E4m and 2007's bottom line by an estimated E8m. Meanwhile, Davy Research made a telling admission 
about the prospects for the Irish economy when it admitted it was wrong in its previous forecasts that the Irish 
economy would bounce back towards trend growth in 2009. "That is not going to happen, thanks to the absence of 
relief in money markets, higher inflation and associated interest rate hikes. Next week's first quarter figures may 
well confirm a technical recession. But the brighter medium-term picture remains intact," its economist, Rossa 
White said. Continuing the mostly downbeat tenor of its analysis, Davy Research said it believes that the current oil-
price-driven crisis could be the worst ever to hit the airline industry. "Long-haul airlines are likely to be the worst 
ISEQ rebounds despite Greencore fall
affected due to their limited ability to pass on fuel price increases. Short-haul should see more rapid market 
contraction, allowing leaders to stay profitable and take market share," said aviation analyst, Stephen Furlong. 
Shares in Ryanair, nevertheless, surged by 19c to E3.06 while Aer Lingus rose by 4c to E1.57 as oil prices shied 
away from new records on the global market. Elsewhere, shares in insurance group, FBD, jumped 19c to E20.69. 
FBD will issue a pre-close trading statement later today and Davy is predicting operating earnings per share of 
260.2 for the full year which represents a decline of 18pc year-on-year. "The bias to this estimate is probably 
downwards due to some pressure on the property/leisure side, and premium rates tracking behind our estimates," it 
said. Among the small caps, recruitment group, CPL Resources announced that it expects its full year 2008 to June 
profit before tax to be in line with current market expectations. Shares closed flat at E2.20.

Air Berlin in Condor rethink
Air Berlin in Condor rethink

Body
Air Berlin's aim to become a major European player hit further trouble yesterday when the German low-cost carrier 
signalled its planned purchase of German charter airline Condor from travel group Thomas Cook was in trouble.
Joachim Hunold, Air Berlin chief executive, told shareholders at the annual meeting that "considerable delays" in 
approval from German authorities and "the changing economic environment" had led to a review of the deal.
Manny Fontenla-Novoa, Thomas Cook chief executive, told the Financial Times the UK group was "discussing the 
future of the deal" and stressed that Condor was "performing well" and the parent company was "not under 
pressure to sell".
Both executives said they were disappointed the German cartel office was still weighing the deal eight months after 
it was announced. But people close to the deal said economic motives had a crucial role in the rethink.
The move came days after the Berlin-based group launched cost cuts - including reducing routes, the phase-out of 
14 of 134 planes, and a 10 per cent reduction in seats on offer - to make up for the drag of record oil prices. The 
programme saw four of 12 Airbus 330 aircraft taken off long-haul routes - markets Mr Hunold had praised for their 
potential when Air Berlin added them with the purchase of another German charter airline, LTU, in 2007.
It was the bolstering of long-haul routes that Mr Hunold stressed when he sealed a deal with the UK's Thomas 
Cook in late September to take over Condor for a cash component and no more than a 29.9 per cent stake in Air 
Berlin.
The deal was Mr Hunold's third in the space of a year. Condor, LTU and German carrier DBA were meant to lift Air 
Berlin's passenger volume close to that of the UK's EasyJet, number two after low-cost leader Ryanair.
People familiar with the Condor deal said buyer and seller had fixed its value at EUR500m (m$779), with Thomas 
Cook slated to extract EUR120m in cash from Condor and receive the difference in Air Berlin stock in February 
2009.
Air Berlin in Condor rethink
At the time it was considering the move, Air Berlin's shares had just reached an all-time high of EUR20 and people 
familiar with the deal said it expected a solid share price to persist so it could finance the deal solely with stock.
But rising oil prices and problems integrating LTU have since pushed Air Berlin's shares below EUR5. This price 
values the one-third maximum stake pledged to Thomas Cook at EUR95m, leaving EUR300m yet to be financed.
After Air Berlin saw operating profit slump to EUR21.4m on revenues of EUR2.5bn last year, Mr Hunold yesterday 
warned shareholders meeting at Stansted in the UK that this year would also see "a difficult operating 
environment".

German shares are expected to open largely flat Tuesday, as the positive effects of late-session upwards 
movement on Wall Street is seen being offset by losses in Asian markets this morning and less-than-ideal 
macroeconomic conditions.
After the close of trade in Frankfurt, the DJIA added some 10.0 points, but finished regular trading 0.33 points lower 
at 11,842.36.
Equities losses were paced by financials, which fell on talk about lay-offs in the investment banking operations of 
Citigroup and Goldman Sachs and automakers, which were hit by rising oil prices.
At 8:01 a.m., the DAX 30 index was seen opening around 1 point lower at 6,588.39 points.
Last Friday, the index closed 11.02 points, or 0.17 percent, higher at 6,589.46.

The ISEQ index today headed sharply lower as banks once again slumped and surging global oil prices sent 
Ryanair shares tumbling.
The index closed 105.45 points lower at 5,289.11.
In July of last year, the ISEQ index reached the dizzy heights of 9,523, a multi-year high. Since then the global 
credit crunch, the slump in the Irish property and construction sectors and the faltering economy has sent share 
prices reeling.
 Financial and building-related stocks - which together make up 66pc of the total share capital on offer, were the 
main casualties with the big bank shares now down between 38pc and 50pc. The ISEQ Financial sub-index of the 
Irish Stock Exchange dropped by 225 points or 3.28pc yesterday morning alone and is now, at 6,647, a whisker 
away from its one-year low of 6,577. Bad economic news once again weighed on investor confidence with the 
previously unmentionable -R-word rearing its ugly head. The state's economic think-tank, the Economic and Social 
Research Institute (ESRI), said Ireland is on the cusp of recession and has slashed its forecasts for the Irish 
economy. It expects the volume of GNP to fall 0.4pc in 2008 compared with 2007 - its previous forecast was for 
growth of 1.6pc. Davy projects growth of 1pc in real GNP. The sharp decline in new houses being built continued in 
May with 33pc less completed than in the same month last year. This compares to an annual fall in completions of 
49pc in March and 19pc in Aril, according to data just released by the Department of the Environment. In more bad 
news, Hibernian Group announced yesterday that it is cutting more than one quarter of its workforce under a three 
year restructuring plan which will be phased in from next year. Hibernian is owned by UK insurer, Aviva, however 
AIB has a 25pc share in Hibernian's life assurance operation. Shares in AIB fell by 29c to E9.61 compared to 
E21.22 a share this time last year. Bank of Ireland fell by 27c to E5.78 compared to E15.50 a year ago and Anglo 
Irish, which initiated a legal case against a London broker over alleged malicious rumours, saw its shares fall by 24c 
ISEQ slumps below the 5,300 mark
to E6.41. Anglo's shares were at E17.57 each a year ago. Irish Life and Permanent shares dropped 17c to E8.5 
compared to its high of E19.25 last July. Builders, however, were the biggest fallers of the day with McInerney 
topping the list with a decline of 10pc or 7c to E0.62 while CRH dropped by 46c to E17.70 and Kingspan fell by 13c 
to E6.07. Kingspan's investor day on June 23rd featured a number of presentations focusing on the longer-term 
outlook for the business. The message, Davy Research said, was that current market weakness notwithstanding, 
the longer-term opportunity remains excellent. Ryanair was another top faller with its shares down nearly 5pc or 14c 
to E2.82 as global crude oil prices once again went through the roof, edging towards the all-time record of USD138 
a barrel again after oil cartel, OPEC said it has no plans to come to the world's rescue and will not be boosting 
output again. Shares in Aer Lingus dropped by 2c to E1.54.

Ireland is wrong to put its miracle at risk

After a week of what European leaders call reflection, another Irish referendum beckons, to be held early next year. 
Without it, there might well be an attempt to oust the Irish from the European Union.
A Yes vote in a second referendum is not certain, even if the Irish government were to succeed in securing another 
rent-extracting, treaty-amending protocol. At a time when the Irish economy is about to fall off a cliff, enthusiasm for 
the EU and its treaties will not increase. In other words, holding a referendum would be as risky as not holding a 
referendum. A fine mess.
So within a couple of weeks, the chances of Ireland ending up outside the EU have turned from zero to a distinct 
possibility. The same goes for the Czech Republic, another potential non-ratifier. I do not want to get into the legal 
details of how a country's departure from the EU could be accomplished. Suffice it to say that it can be done within 
European law as long as there is political will.
What strikes me the most about this extraordinary turn of events is the perception in Ireland that a break with the 
EU would be no big deal. I received a large number of letters from Ireland last week from readers who steadfastly 
maintain that the country's economic success had nothing to do with the EU and everything to do with domestic 
policy - in particular with low corporate taxes and skilled labour.
The view expressed by those correspondents is as wrong as it is revealing. If so many people are delusional about 
their country's economy, then we should perhaps not be surprised about the outcome of the referendum. It is 
therefore perhaps worth looking in some detail at the nature of Ireland's economic success over the last 30 years to 
gauge what life might be like outside the EU.
There are several interactive factors. The importance of EU subsidies is almost certainly overrated. They played 
some part, especially in the early phase of the country's economic renaissance. In any case, Ireland is on the verge 
of becoming a net contributor to the EU budget. But one would be even more mistaken to conclude the opposite: 
that the EU matters nothing or little.
Ireland was one of the early and enthusiastic members of the European Monetary System in 1979, which brought 
much needed macroeconomic stability. Membership of the eurozone in 1999 led to lower interest rates, which have 
contributed to the economic growth ever since. Low corporate tax rates certainly helped Ireland attract foreign 
Ireland is wrong to put its miracle at risk
investors. But never forget that Ireland is also the only English-speaking member of the eurozone, the one place 
where eurozone and Anglosphere meet.
The country naturally benefited from membership of the EU's internal market. Without it, Ryanair, the Irish low-cost 
airline, would not be able to offer its popular flights across Europe. The Irish have also proved influential in the 
management of the internal market, not least through Charlie McCreevy, the Irish commissioner in charge of the 
EU's internal market and financial services. As a member of the EU, Ireland has been in a position to veto motions 
that would have impaired the country's economic success. Without steadfast opposition from Ireland, the EU would 
have made more headway in imposing corporate tax harmonisation.
I do not want to play down the importance of domestic policies either. Ireland owes its success to a complex set of 
policies and circumstances. Perhaps among the most important were the various tripartite social partnership 
agreements since 1987, through which the government, employers and the trade unions achieved a combination of 
wage moderation, high employment and low taxes. This form of round-table corporatism works best in tiny open 
economies if it works at all. It is ironic that this country, whose officials take pleasure in hectoring others on free-
market economics, is in fact one of Europe's most corporatist states. Even France and Germany cannot produce so 
much social partnership, and I can assure you that this is not for lack of trying.
So what would happen if Ireland were to leave the EU? As an associate member of the single European market, 
Ireland would probably attract less foreign investment than it does today. Dublin's financial centre would be 
demonised as an offshore tax haven and treated on par with Liechtenstein. We would see lots of Ryanair flights 
between Dublin and Cork and the EU would put even more pressure on Ireland to raise corporate taxes.
Oh, and by the way, Ireland would no longer be a member of the eurozone. The Irish could use the euro if they 
wanted to but this would be like Panama using the dollar - a little sad, really. There would be no Irish voice in the 
European Central Bank's governing council warning that this is not a good time to raise interest rates. Leaving the 
EU involves a huge loss power and influence.
To put it mildly, the No vote is highly risky. Considering that the country is now on the verge of a severe economic 
slowdown, brought on by a downturn in the real estate market and the credit market crisis, it could not have come at 
a worse time. Not only does the No vote carry risks, it is a highly asymmetric gamble that brings no material benefit 
under the best of circumstances. The No vote put Europe's most impressive economic miracle at stake, and the 
cards are not looking good.

Culinary adventurers take to the Loire à bicyclette, writes Ros Drinkwater.
The village of Chitenay is a mere dot on the map, but it is rural Touraine in a nutshell. The cottages lining the main 
street have well tended rose gardens and windows with old-fashioned lace curtains patterned with scenes from 
arcadia.
There's a handsome church, a convivial tabac/ café, a boulangerie/patisserie and, most important of all, an inspired 
hotelier by the name of Gilles Martinet. Born to the job (he grew up in the Auberge du Centre), he has created a 
gem of a Logis de France.
His recipe for success is simple, the prettiest dining room in the Loire Valley, a garden brimful of colour and scent, 
and food fit for a king, accompanied by the best of local vintages chosen by his discerning palate. The day had 
begun some distance away with a surprise.
I don't like dark and I certainly don't care for damp, but I found myself 50 metres underground in a troglodyte cave 
utterly captivated by an astonishing sight viewed by torch light - thousands of mushrooms of every type, shape and 
colour quietly thriving in the velvet black damp.
The location was La Cave des Roches at Bourré , where proprietor M Andre de Lalande explained that the 
underground caverns of the former Tuffeau stone quarry were excavated centuries ago to provide building stone for 
Tourainès châteaux.
A modern recreation of the kind of entire towns that existed underground has been sculpted out of the limestone, 
but the real business is mushrooms, an enterprise begun in 1893.
Franc e was once the world's No 1 producer of edible fungi. Today, that title belongs to the Chinese, so the new 
focus is on gourmet varieties, chocolate-brown Ceps (M de Lalande reminded us that the nutritional value of a 
Mushrooms, silk and Vouvray
mushroom lies in its skin - they should never be peeled), the sensuous Pied Bleu, Shii Taki, La Pleurote, White 
Oyster and the delightfully tiny Yellow Oyster that grows in clusters resembling underwater sea anemones.
A Unesco World Heritage site, the Loire Valley is famed for its magnificent river, its Renaissance châteaux, 
medieval villages and glorious countryside, but it also offers a host of unusual activities - mushrooms are the tip of 
iceberg.
This is the ideal destination for those who crave more than sun, sand and sea, and thanks to Ryanair's new direct 
flights Dublin to Tours, getting there is a doddle.
Tours itself makes an ideal base for excursions to the hinterland. Lively is the word for the medieval Old Town, a 
pedestrian haven where 15th century half-timbered houses tower above pavement cafes - head for the Place 
Plumeau if you've a mind to check out la jeunesse.
Just off the place (square) in the Rue Breconner the pavements were stained purple with the fruits of a huge 
mulberry tree in the Jardin Henry de Segogne, a reminder of the city's heyday as a silk-making centre.
Fashionistas can checkout how the stuff is actually made by taking a tour of Le Manach Factory, the last place left 
in France that produces hand-woven silk. Be warned, you'll never see fabric in quite the same light again. The 
process that transforms the cocoon spun by the silkworm into the lustrous Jacquard of a couture ballgown is mind-
blowingly complex. It takes ten years to master the intricacies of the huge looms that make a deafening clatter, as 
the first computer programs (designed circa 1800) set the destiny of the fabric to-be.
Outside Tours in June the farmland is ablaze with scarlet poppies and every road leads to a château - there are 800 
of them. On a short visit, I would advise attempting no more than one a day. If you book into Auberge du Centre in 
Chitenay, a good choice would be Cheverny, a mecca for Tintin fans as the Belgian comic book creator Hervé used 
it as a model for his fictional Château de Moulinsart (Marlinspike Hall in English) in the Adventures of Tintin.
A prime example of Louis XIII classical style, it's a bit too severely symmetrical for my taste - I prefer the more 
romantic châteaux, the kind bristling with fairytale turrets - but the scent of the herbs and flowers in the beautiful 
potager blew me away.
Through the centuries, the châteaux of the Loire have served as royal palaces, prisons, and the Château 
d'Amboise, where Leonardo da Vinci is buried, spent some time as a button factory. Gloriously restored, it has a 
magnificent collection of Gothic and Renaissance furniture and in summer presents Son et Lumière.
I was lunching on assiette du terroir at the Café Bigot in the town of Amboise, when a pretty sight flashed past, une 
famille à bicyclette, Papa in the lead, a small luggage trailer attached to his bike, two small children following behind 
and Mama bringing up the rear.
The Loire Valley now boasts 600 kilometres of purpose-built, secure, signposted tracks, the itineraries ranging from 
the Wine Cycle Route (20k) to the Nature Itinerary (60k) to In the Footsteps of the Authors (150k), a route which 
tracks the haunts of Ronsard, Balzac and Rabelais through some of the most beautiful gardens and loveliest 
villages in France.
Bikes can be hired and returned at dozens of rental points - you don't have to go back to your starting point. If you 
time for only one major outing, make it the Château de Villandry, unusual in that it is a lived-in family home, 
supported purely by the revenue from its visitors and famed for its restored Renaissance gardens - the finest in 
France.
Built in 1536, the château was on the point of being demolished when, in 1906, it was bought by a Spaniard and his 
wealthy American wife.
Joachim Carvallo abandoned a brilliant scientific career to devote himself to the restoration of Villandry and today 
his great grandson carries on his good work.
Mushrooms, silk and Vouvray
The marvel is the ornamental kitchen garden, at the same time the recreation of a Renaissance masterpiece and an 
exercise in cutting-edge contemporary minimalism.
For something completely different, visit the Château de Chaumont-sur-Loire where the Garden Festival runs from 
May until October. Chaumont has been described as the unbuttoned French cousin of the Chelsea Flower Show.
Traditionalists should brace themselves for the sharp end of contemporary design, for the emphasis here is on 
quirky, innovative ways to use outdoor space rather than plants.
This year's theme, Sharing the Garden, has resulted in an eruption of recycling and one garden (le jardin poubelle) 
is entirely constructed from the leftover materials of all the other exhibitors gardens.
The setting, however, is idyllic, high over the river, against the backdrop of the fairy-tale castle.
No visit to the Loire Valley would be complete without sampling some of the nine appellations d'origine controllée 
and in the 16th century underground caverns of Caves Duprés you'll find Chinon, Bourgueil, St Nicolas de 
Bourgueil, Saumur Champigny, Vouvray and Montlouis.
Stored wines go back to the legendary 1959 vintage - corks are changed every 20 years because of the dangers of 
oxidisation. The fourth generation patron will be happy to suggest a suitable wine for every dish and every 
occasion, even Irish stew left him unfazed. ''20-year-old Vouvray," he said without hesitation, ''opened, of course, 
two hours before serving''.

The Dublin market lost yet more ground, despite getting a lift from strong buying of Ryanair stocks and as Elan 
continued to benefit from a favourable outlook for its pipeline drugs.
The index closed 23.20 points lower at 5,466.18.
European markets put in a lacklustre performance with investors awaiting fresh leads before committing. UK blue 
chips closed lower on Friday, having extended losses in afternoon deals as Wall Street fell on the back of 
escalating worries about the financial sector and a rally in oil prices, with weakness seen among banks in London.
 Looking at the key financial and construction stocks in Dublin, NCB Stockbrokers said next month's likely hike in 
rates will do the shares no favours. The hike in interest rates in July signalled by ECB president, Jean-Claude 
Trichet will halt any improvement in affordability and as a result prolong the woes of the Irish housing market, an 
assessment from NCB Stockbrokers' economist, Brian Devine, said. "Given that ECB's reputation as a reliable 
policymaker is at stake, the Irish markets can only hope that the pre-announced rate rise will be a one-shot move, 
with no follow up rises. Thus, a crucial question in the Irish housing markets context is: How likely are the follow on 
rises after July 2008?" he asked. Shares in banks were mixed with AIB down 7c to E10.34, Bank of Ireland edged 
up 1c to E6.59, Anglo Irish edged up by 2c to E6.92 while Irish Life and Permanent dropped by 8c to E9.12 after the 
shares rose sharply on Thursday on the back of a "could have been worse" interim half year report. Looking back 
on the IL and P report, Goodbody Stockbrokers said it is now cutting its operating pre-tax profit estimate from 
E545m to E518m for the full year - a fall of 5pc. This leaves its forecast well below the company guided range of 
E535 to E550m. "The main adjustment is lower life profits. Our banking figures are broadly unchanged, having 
already pared them back considerably. We are also cutting back our dividend growth rate to flat, from the previous 
5pc growth target. Finally, we are also putting through a combined E220m negative investment and economic 
variance compared to just E75m previously," said analyst, Eamonn Hughes. Airlines helped to keep the ISEQ out of

the red as oil prices showed at least some respite from the extreme volatility of the past weeks. Aer Lingus shares

close 1c lower at E3.05. UK no-frills airline, easyJet, announced its latest measure to boost ancillary revenues and 
one that could well be followed by its bigger Irish peers. It will allow passengers book extra weight allowances 
online at a 17pc discount to the charge at the airport check in desk. The online cost will be £15 per three kilos over 
the 20-kilo limit. Elan shares jumped by 71c to E20.55. The top-line Phase II data on Elan's Alzheimer's treatment, 
Bapineuzumab, were better than Davy's expectations "given what look to be robust efficacy results in the ApoE4 
non-carrier group". Increased confidence in development prospects and commercial potential led the broker to 
upgrade its risked valuation.

Carnival downgrades earnings guidance as fuel costs bite

Carnival, the world's biggest cruise operator, has become the latest company to issue a profits warning as a result 
of the surging oil price.
The Miami-based company, which operates the Cunard and Princess cruise lines, said full-year earnings were 
expected to be between $2.70 and $2.80 a share, compared with its previous guidance of $3.00 to $3.20 a share.
The warning came in spite of efforts by the group to counter higher fuel costs by increasing ticket prices.
Micky Arison, chief executive, said: "The impact of skyrocketing fuel prices on our operating results has 
overshadowed the revenue yield improvement we have experienced."
Oil prices have roughly doubled over the past year.
A number of airlines, including EasyJet and Ryanair, have warned in recent months that the run-up in fuel prices 
could lead to a sharp decline in their profits this year.
Mr Arison said second-quarter results were better than forecast due to solid cost controls.
"Our North American and European brands continue to perform well in the current difficult economic environment 
and we were pleased with our second-quarter results.
"Despite the current difficult economic environment, our booking trends continue to be solid," he said.
However, higher fuel prices cost the company $158m (£80m), or 19 cents a share, during the quarter. The company 
said it was expecting this year's fuel cost to be $752m higher compared with 2007.
Net profit for the second quarter was $390m, or 49 cents a share, compared with $390m, or 48 cents a share, in the 
same period a year ago.
Carnival downgrades earnings guidance as fuel costs bite
Analysts had on average expected quarterly earnings of about 42 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.
Quarterly revenue was $3.4bn compared with $2.9bn in the same period a year ago.
The shares rose 16p to £17.39.
The stock has fallen by more than 30 per cent over the past year.

Body
No-frills airline, Ryanair, today announced a new daily service from Ireland West Knock to Liverpool John Lennon 
Airport.
The new service will begin on October 27 with the airline already flying between Knock and London Luton and 
London Stansted airports in addition to the four-times-a-week services to East Midlands as well as Bristol 
International which commenced last November.
It is expected that this latest expansion by Ryanair at Ireland West Knock will generate an estimated 100,000 
additional annual passengers at the Airport.
 Robert Grealis, Chief Executive of Ireland West Airport Knock said: "The addition of this direct daily service to 
Liverpool with Ryanair is another significant step in the Airport's development as we continue to provide an ever-
widening choice of great value, direct and convenient jet flights to our customers both in Ireland and in the UK. This 
new route further expands our network of scheduled jet flight services to key UK destinations and it will provide a 
significant boost to the region's tourism and commercial economies. The route should deliver 30,000 additional UK 
tourists with an associated spend of over E12.5 million to the West and North West. I'm sure it will also be a 
welcome boost to the thousands of Liverpool and Everton supporters in the region also!"

Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings Plc. said all the flights to Romania's Arad airport have been cancelled effective 
July 31, due to the failure of the County Council and its president, Iosif Matula to sign and honour its agreement 
with Ryanair.
Ryanair said it will replace the Arad service with a three times weekly service from Bergamo in Italy to Berlin 
Schoenefeld.
The company said it had been looking forward to carrying 50,000 passengers in the first year of operations to the 
Arad region.
The budget carrier said, based on the short-lived success of the three flights per week it was running to Arad - 
which started in April - it had been considering expanding services from the Airport but now all plans for additional 
flights have been cancelled.

Aer Lingus cuts capacity as it braces for losses
Aer Lingus cuts capacity as it braces for losses

Rising fuel costs prompt Irish carrier to defer new aircraft deliveries and suspend key US route, writes Kevin Done
Body
Aer Lingus, the Irish carrier, has been forced by record fuel costs to rein in ambitious growth plans prepared for its 
long-haul network.
It is cutting long-haul capacity sharply in the coming winter season and is highly dependent on gaining all of its 2008 
profits during the three summer months.
It is suspending one of its key routes to the US west coast from November and has forecast it will fall into loss this 
year at current fuel prices. It is also joining the increasing number of airlines to defer some new aircraft deliveries, 
as it seeks to slow its planned capacity growth.
The airline says it is sticking to its medium-term long-haul growth strategy, developed two years ago as part of the 
group's initial public offering in October 2006. It planned to double its fleet of long-haul aircraft from seven to 14 by 
2014.
Aer Lingus has become more cautious about its plans for 2009, however, as the global airline industry braces itself 
for mounting losses and weakening demand for air travel in the face of surging fuel costs and the resulting rise in 
fares as airlines seek to pass on part of the higher fuel bills to passengers.
The Irish carrier, in which local rival Ryanair holds a hostile stake of 29.3 per cent, is in effect cutting its long-haul 
capacity by 15 per cent in the coming winter season, including the suspension of its longest route between Dublin 
and Los Angeles.
Enda Corneille, Aer Lingus' corporate affairs director, said in an interview with the Financial Times: "LA is the 
longest sector and is being hit disproportionately at the current price of oil."
Aer Lingus cuts capacity as it braces for losses
It would maintain its new route to San Francisco, however, which was opened last October along with two other 
new routes to Washington Dulles and Orlando, as it moved to take early advantage of the US-European "open 
skies" treaty.
Aer Lingus says for the moment it has no plans to suspend any further long-haul routes from either Dublin or 
Shannon on the west coast of Ireland, but Mr Corneille said, "the Shannon winter long-haul schedule is a real 
struggle".
Any move to reduce its long-haul presence in Shannon would provoke a political uproar, however, following the 
turmoil triggered last summer when Aer Lingus announced it was ending its services between Shannon and London 
Heathrow in favour of using the Heathrow slots to launch London services from its new base in Belfast.
Aer Lingus had originally - with a current fleet of nine long-haul Airbus A330 jets - planned to take delivery of three 
new A330s in 2009 and to retire one older plane, leaving a fleet of 11.
Mr Corneille said the plan was now to maintain the fleet at nine next year. A second older plane would be retired 
and one of the new deliveries from Airbus would be deferred to 2010.
During the winter season three of the existing long-haul fleet will be taken out of service to be refurbished to 
common cabin standards, with the new deliveries leading to the overall cut of 15 per cent in winter capacity.
John Sharman, Aer Lingus chairman, told investors two weeks ago that, based on current fuel prices and given the 
uncertain economic outlook, the airline expected "at best to break even" in 2008.
NCB Stockbrokers forecast that, based on a crude oil price of $125 a barrel, Aer Lingus would fall from an operating 
profit of EUR88.5m last year to an operating loss of EUR4.6m (£3.6m) this year and a deeper loss of EUR47.1m in 
2009.
Offsetting the rising fuel bill, Aer Lingus is seeking to cut other costs. Reform of working practices is expected to 
yield savings on labour costs of EUR20m this year, while recent radical changes to the airline's maintenance 
contracts are also expected to lead to savings of EUR20m in 2009.
The group is also hoping for increased long-haul revenues - its routes are exclusively to the US - from its decision 
to open a codesharing partnership with United Airlines from November and to drop its long-standing arrangement 
with American Airlines. It is also developing a marketing alliance with JetBlue.
